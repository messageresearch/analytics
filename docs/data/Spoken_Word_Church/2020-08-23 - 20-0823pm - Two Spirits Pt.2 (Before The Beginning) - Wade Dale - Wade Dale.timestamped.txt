[5:38] uh he and my self were going to brother
[5:41] jewel's
[5:43] um dedicational service for his church
[5:46] he's been preaching some sounds a lot
[5:48] better than he did
[5:49] lord a month ago it sounded like he was
[5:52] just a whisper but when i spoke to him
[5:54] yesterday or day before yesterday he
[5:55] sounded really good
[5:57] so he's he's getting the church open and
[5:59] brother dale's going to dedicate it
[6:01] and on sunday at 11 o'clock that will be
[6:04] on the 30th not this
[6:06] it'll be obviously not today it'll be
[6:09] next sunday
[6:10] so that's where we will be and brother
[6:11] bob and brother aaron and they can
[6:14] cast lots who's going to do sunday
[6:15] morning and sunday afternoon
[6:18] but just remember them in your prayers
[6:21] all these brother they'll be
[6:22] traveling tomorrow and
[6:26] wednesday and sunday so just remember
[6:29] him keep them all in your prayers so i
[6:31] know we all have unspoken requests that
[6:33] we
[6:34] hold before the lord but we know who
[6:37] we know who the healer is he's the
[6:39] healer and
[6:41] we pray that he just sends a healing
[6:42] angel by today and
[6:44] and just heal all those that need it we
[6:47] many many requests of people
[6:49] all over the country that's being
[6:51] affected
[6:53] not just by the virus but by a lot of
[6:55] things
[6:56] fears grown among the people i don't say
[6:58] so much of people the
[7:00] message but fears grown among the world
[7:02] causing people to go crazy and do crazy
[7:05] things but
[7:05] um that's what we're promised
[7:09] this world is going to become insane
[7:13] so you know why they become insane
[7:15] because you know what they don't know
[7:16] where they came from
[7:18] they don't even know what they're doing
[7:19] here and they sure don't know where
[7:21] they're going
[7:22] they might have a thought that maybe i
[7:23] can my um no
[7:25] we must have as the bride of jesus
[7:27] christ an assurity
[7:29] of where we come from what we're doing
[7:30] here where we're going i believe that's
[7:32] what the message of the hour has brought
[7:34] us
[7:36] and it's brought us clarity not
[7:38] confusion
[7:40] if it's confusion it's that other spirit
[7:42] if it's clarity it's the spirit of god
[7:45] all right so let's bow our heads we're
[7:47] still on two spirits and
[7:48] and the title is going to tell you that
[7:50] we're going to be reading some of the
[7:51] same things
[7:52] that brother dale spoke on this morning
[7:54] but um
[7:56] before the beginning we're going before
[7:59] the beginning
[8:00] okay so we're going we're going way on
[8:02] back and um
[8:04] you'll have to just give me patience
[8:08] because there's a lot of things that we
[8:11] don't have quotes for
[8:14] but i believe that as you as you pray
[8:16] and as we all pray as ministers we pray
[8:18] that
[8:19] that the lord will do the speaking if
[8:22] he's the one that was back there
[8:25] god if he was the one that's back there
[8:28] before there was anything written before
[8:29] there was anything moving before there
[8:31] was anything
[8:33] he obviously has not forgot it
[8:37] he's an eyewitness he wasn't even an
[8:38] eyewitness he was he was the person that
[8:40] did it
[8:41] then if we have the baptism of the holy
[8:43] ghost today then i believe that same
[8:45] person that was standing back there
[8:47] he's in a he's in morphine and morphed
[8:50] into a form called the bride
[8:52] he didn't change his thought process i
[8:55] was thinking this morning you know god
[8:56] don't have ideas
[8:58] that's right humans have ideas
[9:02] because when god had a thought it became
[9:04] material
[9:05] he didn't have to think it over that's
[9:08] an idea
[9:09] i have an idea for this and not god
[9:11] don't have ideas
[9:13] god's thoughts are eternal and his
[9:15] process is eternal and
[9:17] we just got to get in that process and
[9:18] that's what we're going to try to do
[9:19] with these two spirits is to show
[9:22] where we are at where we came from what
[9:24] we're doing here and where we're going
[9:26] so let's buy our heads before we begin
[9:28] dear lord thank you for this day
[9:30] we pray that you'd sanctify us lord for
[9:32] this journey that we're on
[9:36] some it's been a real long journey lord
[9:37] and i pray that you give them comfort
[9:39] be with the ones that are sick lord this
[9:42] journey in this human body gets
[9:45] as we say it gets older and older
[9:47] because of the
[9:48] curse but lord we're inside lord is that
[9:52] young man that you took that picture of
[9:55] as we were speaking the other night
[9:58] that's what you're looking at lord but
[10:00] two though you came down here in the
[10:02] human body one time and
[10:04] you had heart aches and problems in that
[10:07] human body so lord you know
[10:09] what we're going through and i pray that
[10:11] you would
[10:12] send that bomb of gilead lord that you
[10:14] have lord that will
[10:15] soothe over a lot of the aches and pains
[10:18] of humanity that we have
[10:20] trials and tribulations fear a lot of
[10:23] different things that are gripping
[10:24] people now lord we pray that you would
[10:27] help us to point our eyes towards you
[10:29] lord
[10:30] and know that you told us the right
[10:32] thing the first time
[10:34] and you never have to take it back you
[10:36] never have to change your plan
[10:38] it was perfect to begin with and lord i
[10:40] put my
[10:42] everything i got on that and then thank
[10:45] you god
[10:46] that you sent us a prophet that could
[10:48] tell us these things
[10:50] and bring that secret as brother dale
[10:52] was talking this morning bring that
[10:53] secret
[10:53] hidden mystery bring it right to us and
[10:56] make it not just
[10:57] tell us in words but lord make it so
[11:00] vivid
[11:01] and make it strike home to our hearts
[11:03] and just to say as sister hattie wright
[11:05] said that ain't nothing but the truth
[11:07] father lord we pray that you'd be with
[11:09] the ones that are sick in this church
[11:11] ones that are not with us with this
[11:13] church around the world you're bride of
[11:15] jesus christ lord we're groaning and
[11:17] waiting
[11:18] for that time lord where we can get out
[11:21] of here lord
[11:23] but we have a little bit of a time left
[11:24] lord for a journey that we need to get
[11:26] ready and get processed
[11:28] so that we can end this thing up lord
[11:30] death can be destroyed
[11:32] and we can leave this place and lord let
[11:35] satan destroy it whatever he wants to do
[11:38] and then we'll come back lord on a
[11:39] redeemed
[11:41] entire earth as the prophet tells us in
[11:44] your future home
[11:45] be with us bless us be with our pastor
[11:47] as he travels this week
[11:49] and with the dale roberts family
[11:53] lord we pray that you would give them
[11:54] comfort you are the only one that can
[11:57] we can talk words and speak but lord
[12:00] you're the only one that can
[12:01] in the hour of quietness and the hour
[12:04] that
[12:05] maybe they get lonely wanting their dad
[12:08] that you're the only one that can come
[12:10] in and fill that void
[12:11] we pray that you'll do that now father
[12:13] we ask your blessings on this service
[12:16] be with us in jesus name amen first john
[12:19] 4 verse 1 says beloved believe not every
[12:21] spirit
[12:23] all right there's your warning but try
[12:26] the spirits whether they are of god
[12:29] because many faults what prophets
[12:32] are gone out into the world hereby know
[12:35] ye the spirit of god
[12:37] every spirit that confesses now remember
[12:39] that word if you looked it up
[12:41] you'll see that word confesseth means
[12:44] logos that's the very
[12:49] embodiment of almighty god so you're
[12:52] what you're doing is you're
[12:53] bringing you're basing your confession
[12:56] on that logos inside of you
[12:59] because that's where it's at it's inside
[13:01] you and you're comparing yourself and
[13:04] you're
[13:04] what you're confessing that jesus christ
[13:07] is coming the flesh
[13:08] is of god because we weren't there
[13:12] there's no proof physical proof that
[13:14] jesus ever walked here
[13:17] as far as a photograph or no there's
[13:20] stories written down
[13:21] and there's places that there but we
[13:23] have to believe in our heart
[13:24] that he did come here in the flesh and
[13:27] if you have that logos inside of you
[13:29] it knows that it came in the flesh
[13:30] because it was inside that flesh
[13:33] well that's kind of hard but it's really
[13:35] very simple and every spirit that
[13:36] confesses not that jesus christ has come
[13:38] in the flesh
[13:39] is not of god and this is that spirit of
[13:42] antichrist
[13:43] whereof you have heard that it should
[13:45] come and even now already
[13:48] is it in the world and that's in a.d
[13:50] about 96
[13:51] little that john's writing the little
[13:53] john's ye are of god little children
[13:57] and you have overcome them what the
[13:59] antichrist because greater is he that's
[14:01] in you
[14:02] than he that's in the world they are of
[14:04] the world
[14:05] therefore speak they of the world and
[14:07] the world heareth them
[14:10] we are of god he that knoweth god
[14:12] heareth us
[14:13] and he that is not of god here's not us
[14:17] that's pretty simple they don't try to
[14:20] talk to them about the
[14:21] the word of god the true word of god
[14:24] it's all sounding brass and tinkling
[14:27] symbols
[14:28] they just don't know what you're talking
[14:29] about hereby know we
[14:31] the spirit of truth and the spirit of
[14:34] aaron you may be seated in the lord that
[14:35] is blessing to the reading of the word
[14:38] we're going to background just a little
[14:39] bit from wednesday and then we're going
[14:42] to
[14:44] head out before the beginning
[14:47] amen ezekiel 28 verse 11 let's go let's
[14:50] read that one
[14:51] because we got to bring this one in
[14:52] because moreover the word of the lord
[14:54] came unto me saying
[14:55] son of man this is in ezekiel take up a
[14:58] lamentation
[14:59] upon the king of taurus now remember the
[15:01] king of tires was a regular person
[15:03] he was a king tyrus or the tyre tyre
[15:07] is a city that's mentioned many times in
[15:09] the bible but this
[15:10] is a this is a story
[15:14] because this king of tires wasn't in the
[15:16] garden of eden
[15:18] so what's he talking about he's talking
[15:20] about the devil talking about satan all
[15:21] right
[15:22] talking about lucifer son of man take up
[15:24] a lamentation upon the king
[15:26] of tyres and say unto him thus saith the
[15:28] lord
[15:29] thou see list up to some full of wisdom
[15:32] and perfect in beauty listen lucifer
[15:36] was created the most beautiful angel
[15:39] that ever was
[15:40] he's not some hideous gory bloody red
[15:44] with a long tail with a
[15:46] fork on it and uh the horn that's not
[15:49] lucifer
[15:50] that might be what he think wants you to
[15:52] think about it but he's the slicker
[15:54] brother brown said he's the good-looking
[15:55] guy look at verse 13
[15:57] thou has been in eden the garden of god
[16:01] every precious stone was not covering
[16:03] now look these same stones
[16:06] these same stones talk about jesus over
[16:09] in
[16:10] revelations
[16:14] look at but now look god gave him this
[16:19] thou has been in the e and eating the
[16:21] garden of god every precious stone was
[16:23] thy covering
[16:24] because remember god created lucifer
[16:30] okay now because i'm going to prove it
[16:31] right here the bible's going to prove it
[16:34] sardis topaz diamond burl onyx jasper
[16:38] sapphire emerald carbuncle gold
[16:42] the workmanship of thy tabrets and of
[16:45] thy pipes was prepared in
[16:47] ye in the day that thou was created
[16:51] wow wow now let's go to matthew 24 and
[16:55] read that one
[16:57] for if any man shall say unto you lord
[16:58] hears christ are there believe it not
[17:00] why because they're going to be so close
[17:02] for there shall arise false christs and
[17:04] false prophets and shall show great
[17:06] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[17:07] were possible
[17:09] they shall deceive the very elect now
[17:10] that's what satan's job is is to deceive
[17:13] the very elect
[17:14] he's got all the others the elect is who
[17:16] he's got his attention pointed to
[17:18] all right and it started in a great
[17:20] battle way back before the beginning
[17:23] and we're going to bring some things out
[17:25] today that maybe you need to ponder in
[17:26] your heart and maybe i need to ponder
[17:28] them again but i think they're pretty
[17:30] they're pretty much right according to
[17:32] you know you you get these people that
[17:33] have to have quotes for things
[17:35] well you have to be careful uh brother
[17:38] dale and i were talking another day you
[17:39] can take brother brown you can take many
[17:40] quotes and and make him be wrong
[17:42] i said you can take many quotes and make
[17:45] him say something that he really didn't
[17:46] say
[17:48] let's stand and address the third person
[17:49] of the trinity preach two or three
[17:51] sermons on the mighty conqueror and that
[17:53] being the
[17:54] holy ghost and the first seal which is
[17:56] not true
[17:57] but in his progressive revelation that's
[18:00] all he knew at the time
[18:02] because the holy ghost is a mighty
[18:03] conqueror and he does
[18:05] ride a white horse all right so you see
[18:07] the deception that satan was even
[18:09] deceiving
[18:10] the prophet he deceived everybody on the
[18:14] in the world almost except this little
[18:16] bride is not going to be deceived in the
[18:17] end time
[18:19] and the message that the the prophet of
[18:21] god brought us
[18:23] satan can just beat it to death but
[18:25] there's going to be a true bride
[18:27] that's going to know exactly what god
[18:29] was telling us through that prophet
[18:31] amen everybody got that say amen for
[18:34] there shall arise false christ
[18:36] now not false whatever you want to say
[18:40] these are false anointed ones false
[18:43] christ
[18:44] christ is true but something has to come
[18:48] along and we'll get that
[18:49] late way later on because we got to get
[18:51] back before the beginning
[18:52] and false prophets and shall show great
[18:55] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[18:56] were
[18:57] possible they shall deceive the very leg
[18:59] now let's
[19:00] just review just for a minute let's go
[19:02] to number one which is demonology
[19:04] 1953 brother brown said you know there's
[19:07] there's false
[19:08] there's a true and a false of everything
[19:11] if i give you a dollar and i say this is
[19:13] a good dollar and you'd look at it
[19:15] i'd have to look pretty much like a real
[19:17] dollar or you wouldn't believe it
[19:19] is that right so it'll have to be a
[19:21] really a good
[19:22] imitation and jesus said the two spirits
[19:25] in the last day will be so close
[19:27] till it would deceive the very elect if
[19:29] possible
[19:30] religious people now remember
[19:34] now there ain't nothing out there in
[19:37] them old cold
[19:38] old cord formal outside everybody got
[19:40] them
[19:41] they have just a form of godliness
[19:44] you see but these two spirits are real
[19:47] spirits now what's he saying is
[19:48] don't worry about them out there
[19:53] they're cold formal they're already
[19:54] there you know if they're already caught
[19:56] in the system
[19:57] satan's already got them you don't want
[19:59] you don't go out there and plague
[20:00] somebody you already got
[20:02] right you want the guy that's got the
[20:05] goods as
[20:06] your daddy always says but these two
[20:08] spirits are real spirits it'd be so
[20:10] close to they deceive the very elect
[20:12] how it was working side by side in the
[20:15] last days
[20:16] did jesus say that he did now let's go
[20:19] to the next one which would be
[20:20] god of this evil age let's read that one
[20:25] the two spirits one of them god's holy
[20:28] spirit remember i said last wednesday
[20:29] there's only two spirits for us to deal
[20:31] with
[20:32] the holy spirit and god and in satan
[20:35] spirit the true and the false there's no
[20:38] gray area
[20:39] in between everything either falls under
[20:42] the true or falls under the falls all
[20:44] right
[20:44] the two spirits one of them god's holy
[20:46] spirit the other one the devil's spirit
[20:49] working in deception the people of the
[20:51] earth are now making their choice
[20:54] the holy spirit is here calling out a
[20:55] bride for christ he is doing it by
[20:57] vindicating his word of promise to her
[20:59] for this age showing that it is christ
[21:03] now for somebody to say that that was
[21:05] false
[21:08] that the prophet of god was bringing
[21:09] something false
[21:12] how close is that to blaspheming
[21:17] because they're attributing all of his
[21:19] works to being false
[21:21] i can't see that for this showing that
[21:24] it is christ
[21:25] if the finger is supposed to move in
[21:26] this age the finger will move if the
[21:28] foot is supposed to move in this age the
[21:29] foot will move
[21:30] if the eye is supposed to see in this
[21:32] age i will see see
[21:34] the spirit of god as it's grown into the
[21:36] full stature of god that was my
[21:38] point i was trying to make last
[21:40] wednesday
[21:42] was that this is the apex of deception
[21:45] this is the apex of
[21:47] of christ spirit and this is the apex of
[21:49] satan's spirit
[21:50] because he's going to god but see now
[21:52] look satan is a follower or an imitator
[21:55] because god is going to incarnate a
[21:57] bride
[21:58] and take her off the scene and then
[22:00] satan's just going to step over and
[22:02] incarnate a pope
[22:04] the beast all of what you want to call
[22:06] whatever you want to call him
[22:08] and he'll incarnate him and then he's
[22:10] going to try to take over the world
[22:12] everybody got that all right that's the
[22:13] two spirits the only two spirits
[22:15] it started with two in the beginning
[22:18] it's going to start with two
[22:19] because remember brother brown said
[22:20] every time jesus came on the scene judas
[22:22] would come on the scene
[22:23] holy spirit will come on the scene the
[22:24] antichrist spirit will come on the scene
[22:26] so it's really it's really simple when
[22:29] at the beginning
[22:30] you got two spirits one holy one unholy
[22:33] but
[22:33] so unholy it's almost holy
[22:37] right but remember unholy is only one
[22:40] word
[22:42] eve did an unholy thing because of one
[22:45] word
[22:46] all right that's why we must look at
[22:49] this because you watch what brother
[22:50] brown now i won't get into it today
[22:52] because
[22:52] we got to get back before the beginning
[22:53] this is just what i was talking about
[22:55] last sunday
[22:56] this is as christ comes to his fullness
[22:58] and a bride the antichrist does the same
[23:01] thing
[23:02] because satan has been watching it since
[23:04] time began
[23:05] and even beyond and i'll prove it here
[23:07] in just a few minutes
[23:09] the holy spirit is grown into the full
[23:12] stature of the spirit of god
[23:14] is the age that we're now living in the
[23:16] holy spirit is here vindicating the
[23:18] message of the hour
[23:19] and the holy spirit is doing this so
[23:21] that the people that believe
[23:22] god will be called out of what this
[23:24] chaos out of that other spirit
[23:28] the devil's unholy spirit is here
[23:30] calling his church by error
[23:32] right right wow i'm just telling you
[23:34] what brother brown said
[23:36] as usual by perversion of the word of
[23:39] god
[23:40] because remember he can't create and i
[23:43] believe that's what made him mad
[23:46] we'll talk about in just a few minutes
[23:48] like he did at the beginning
[23:50] see it's coming right back to that seed
[23:52] time again
[23:53] from eden here it is again so let's read
[23:57] number three the seed is not air with
[23:58] shuck
[24:00] 1965 remember there's no more seed
[24:03] promised to a woman anywhere after mary
[24:06] we went over this last sunday but this
[24:07] is the condensed version
[24:09] and there's no more denominations
[24:10] promised after pentecost
[24:12] it's the rapture and bride coming forth
[24:14] from there the seed the word made
[24:16] manifest again what maturity
[24:19] notice see how close it looks matthew
[24:21] said saint matthew 24 24 said
[24:23] the two spirits in the last days the
[24:25] church spirit of the church people
[24:29] ain't talking about the drunks and
[24:30] alcoholics and the whoremongers and
[24:32] adulterers
[24:34] that's not what he said why would that
[24:37] fool us
[24:40] the church spirit of the church people
[24:42] and the bride spirit of the bride people
[24:45] there's your two spirits
[24:47] would be so close together though until
[24:50] it would deceive the very elect it was
[24:51] possible
[24:52] that's how close
[24:56] now let's not read number four because
[24:58] it's the same as number two so skip over
[25:00] to number five
[25:02] this is the one i want to get to an
[25:03] exposition of the seven church ages
[25:06] brother brown says now remember this
[25:07] christ in the true church is a
[25:09] continuation of the book of acts
[25:12] excuse me but the book of revelation
[25:14] shows how that the antichrist spirit
[25:15] would come into the church and defile it
[25:18] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[25:22] it exposes satan revealing his works
[25:24] attempted destruction of god's people
[25:27] and the discrediting of god's word right
[25:29] down to the time he is cast into the
[25:30] lake of fire
[25:31] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[25:34] knows that if the people get the true
[25:36] revelation
[25:37] of the true church because remember
[25:39] there's a church spirit
[25:40] and there's a bride spirit one's one's
[25:44] of god and one's not right all right
[25:47] and what she is and what she stands for
[25:52] and that she can do the greater works
[25:53] the whole world is groaning waiting for
[25:55] the manifestation of the sons of god
[25:57] she will be an invincible army if they
[25:59] get a true revelation of the two spirits
[26:01] within the framework of the
[26:03] christian church we're not talking
[26:07] atheists here
[26:08] we're talking the true spirit in the
[26:09] framework of the christian church and i
[26:11] said
[26:12] last wednesday message church
[26:15] that's where satan's at folks and by
[26:18] god's spirit
[26:19] discern and withstand the antichrist
[26:23] spirit satan will be powerless before
[26:26] her
[26:26] he will be definitely tortured as he was
[26:28] thwarted when he was
[26:30] when christ now what did christ do
[26:31] brother roman another quote brother
[26:33] brown said
[26:34] jesus didn't tie satan up and and shut
[26:37] his mouth and
[26:38] he could have done that right
[26:42] he had control he could have said shut
[26:43] up don't say another word i'll take all
[26:45] that what
[26:45] no he said it is written
[26:49] it is also written because satan was
[26:51] saying now look satan was quoting the
[26:53] scripture to him
[26:55] dash your foot against the stone all
[26:56] that satan said
[26:59] it is also written so let's look at
[27:02] number six here in jude
[27:03] 3 4 and 12. this is an exposition of the
[27:07] seven church ages still a continuation
[27:09] beloved when i give all diligence to
[27:11] write unto you the common salvation it
[27:12] was needed for me to write
[27:14] unto you and exhort you that you should
[27:16] earnestly contend for the faith which
[27:17] was once delivered unto the saints now
[27:19] that's what we're contending for now
[27:21] for there are certain men now look this
[27:23] is brother brown's comments in between
[27:25] here
[27:26] for there are certain men not saints
[27:29] crept in unawares
[27:30] these have not come into the fold by
[27:32] means of the door and are therefore
[27:34] robbers who were before of old ordained
[27:37] to this condemnation
[27:39] ungodly men turning the grace of our god
[27:41] into lasciviousness and denying the only
[27:44] lord god
[27:45] and our lord jesus christ these are
[27:47] spots in your feast of charity
[27:49] when they feast with you
[27:55] they don't have a feast over here and we
[27:58] have a feast over here
[27:59] they're feasting on the same that you're
[28:01] feasting on and y'all must ate a lot
[28:03] because you're already going to sleep
[28:11] they feast with you what feeding
[28:12] themselves without fear
[28:15] as we come boldly to the throne of god
[28:17] they come boldly to it
[28:18] to not the throne of god but they come
[28:20] boldly to be right here with you
[28:21] by or i are among you it cannot be
[28:24] denied now this is the quote he's out of
[28:27] the you know this is all scripture here
[28:29] if you'll read that in jude it cannot be
[28:31] denied in the face of these scriptures
[28:33] that the true church
[28:34] and the false church are intertwined
[28:40] having been planted together
[28:46] but a different seed all right
[28:49] now listen we're not talking about
[28:50] natural seed we'll get into all that how
[28:52] that all developed on down through here
[28:54] but watch
[28:55] another this is number seven quote seven
[28:57] it's from the consummation of the
[28:59] gentile age now this is us
[29:01] laodicean church age this age is the
[29:04] last of the seven church ages what began
[29:06] in the first
[29:06] or ephesian age must and will come to
[29:09] full fruition
[29:10] and harvest in the last layout of cnas
[29:12] now that's where we are
[29:14] that's where we're coming to maturity
[29:17] listen
[29:17] only mature bride
[29:21] will not be trapped right everybody else
[29:24] will be to see
[29:26] the two vines will yield their final
[29:28] fruit
[29:30] the two spirits will terminate their
[29:32] manifestation
[29:33] in each of their final destinations
[29:36] the sowing the watering the growing
[29:40] is all over summer has ended the sickle
[29:43] is now
[29:44] thrust into the harvest that's why
[29:47] brother dale's talking about having a
[29:48] revival you know you have a revival when
[29:50] all that happens you know you get
[29:52] but he had to wait till this time you
[29:55] had to wait till both mature because
[29:56] they're intertwined
[29:58] in my garden right now we should have
[30:01] never let them make ups
[30:02] live they are intertwined with my
[30:06] with my bean vines and they're almost
[30:08] exactly the same
[30:10] but you know what you can't eat them
[30:13] maps
[30:14] and when everybody know what a map is
[30:16] you never had a may pop battle good
[30:18] grief people
[30:19] i'm like brother brown where y'all from
[30:23] anybody anybody cares y'all raise your
[30:26] hand we've had map battles before
[30:28] you get out in the garden it's a it's
[30:30] called a may pop because it's about
[30:32] wasting time explaining this but i got
[30:34] to explain it
[30:35] but they're about this big around and
[30:36] they're growing a little vine it's
[30:38] called a map
[30:39] may pop because it's when you throw it
[30:42] it's kind of hollow inside but it's got
[30:44] air in it
[30:45] it's it's not worth nothing
[30:48] but to throw at your brother and you get
[30:52] them things and you start throwing them
[30:53] at each other and when they hit they go
[30:55] pop that's why they call them may pops
[30:58] some of you that have daddy's never
[31:01] mentioned to you about
[31:02] people's tires were map tires
[31:06] because they may pop at any minute well
[31:08] that's what a map is a map is a fruit
[31:10] and they're worthless
[31:12] but back to my point when they're
[31:14] growing with my with my
[31:16] bean vines they look the same
[31:19] until the fruit comes out because the
[31:21] bean looks way different
[31:23] than that may pop but may pop seed the
[31:26] reason i'm telling you this may pop seed
[31:28] i read about it
[31:29] you should never let may pop come to
[31:31] full maturity because
[31:33] 250 years that seed can lay in the
[31:36] ground
[31:37] so every time i go out there and turn
[31:38] that ground up there's may pops coming
[31:41] up about that high and it's just a
[31:42] regular vine that comes up
[31:43] looks like kind of look like a bean seed
[31:45] but that's what god said now look what
[31:47] god's done he's saying look
[31:49] harvest time brother brown said yes
[31:51] harvest time because we know a bean
[31:53] looks different than that so i can tell
[31:55] the difference when their beans
[31:56] are fruit but you can't tell the
[31:58] difference when they're growing that's
[31:59] why
[32:00] christ told them to wait till it all
[32:01] matured the two vines that grew together
[32:04] and intertwined their branches are now
[32:07] to be separated
[32:09] the fruits of those vines which were at
[32:10] such variance
[32:12] will be gathered into the separate
[32:14] gardeners the two spirits will go to
[32:16] their separate
[32:17] destination so
[32:20] they're not going to the same
[32:21] destination they're going to separate
[32:23] destinations
[32:24] all right so that's the dividing of the
[32:26] two spears has everybody got that say
[32:28] amen
[32:30] but we think that it's the one that
[32:32] opposes is way over here
[32:35] now listen when you're in a battle when
[32:37] you're in a battle
[32:39] you don't fight in one field in another
[32:43] old times used to be hand to hand so
[32:46] what you were close
[32:47] you were so close many times
[32:51] uh brother harris told us when they were
[32:53] fighting in vietnam
[32:54] he said you didn't know who was your
[32:56] enemy or who was your friend because
[32:57] they were both
[32:58] north vietnamese and south vietnamese
[33:00] they both look the same so
[33:02] same way with the bible in the same way
[33:04] with the ba prophet's message and same
[33:06] way with
[33:07] preaching of the message so close they
[33:09] look so much
[33:10] alike all right but we're going to look
[33:14] and see now
[33:15] let's go back and let's read that same
[33:18] quote brother dale read this morning
[33:20] questions and answers on genesis coach
[33:22] where genesis
[33:24] is the beginning of of time
[33:28] creation and time right all right i'm
[33:30] going to slow down here just for a
[33:31] minute
[33:32] creation in time book of genesis brother
[33:34] brown said it's the c
[33:36] chapter both seeds came out of that
[33:38] chapter the
[33:39] serpent seed came out of there and god's
[33:41] seed came from there all right
[33:43] now remember also remember this like
[33:45] brother dale said there's a spiritual
[33:47] seed and there's a natural seed
[33:51] we're not talking about natural seed
[33:53] lines you cannot
[33:55] by no means run your lineage back to see
[33:58] whether you were on cane side
[34:01] or really doesn't matter because when it
[34:04] when the fall happened
[34:06] god gave everybody a choice
[34:10] so there you do away with seed lines if
[34:13] you say well now god didn't give cain a
[34:14] chance well now his whole line
[34:16] you could say well they're just serpents
[34:17] see they're just dead no he gave them
[34:20] all a chance
[34:21] he gave cain's children a choice
[34:24] all down through time he's given choices
[34:27] and we're going to see right here that
[34:28] by the word of god we're going to
[34:29] understand
[34:30] that satan had a choice
[34:34] the angels have a choice even though
[34:36] listen the angels are not
[34:38] human now brother brown said
[34:42] angels are not him they are spirits
[34:45] right
[34:47] they cannot and we'll talk about this
[34:49] next sunday
[34:52] whenever later we'll be gone that sunday
[34:56] but remember those fallen angels that
[34:59] we're going to talk about in a minute
[35:01] they did not enter into human beings
[35:04] right they influence
[35:08] human beings everybody got that say amen
[35:11] they influence they never because they
[35:13] asked brother brown that
[35:14] two times in the message if you'll look
[35:16] up fallen angels
[35:17] he'll say there's no way that that angel
[35:20] could get into you and become that would
[35:23] be transm that would be taking donny's
[35:25] soul out
[35:26] and putting a demon soul in him no you
[35:29] got to remember
[35:29] though that you've got two spirits
[35:34] the good spirit and the bad spirit
[35:37] everybody got that you and i
[35:41] on this side of the fall we're fixing to
[35:43] talk about going back on the other side
[35:44] but on this side of the fall
[35:46] we have a choice to make you were born
[35:49] and given life
[35:50] in your soul but you have to choose
[35:52] whether you want
[35:53] eternal life that's why i don't agree
[35:57] with people that you can't make it fit
[35:59] my whole bible
[36:00] that we were born with some kind of an
[36:01] eternal seed inside of us i don't see
[36:03] that none whatsoever
[36:05] that does away with redemption right
[36:08] that's right
[36:09] why didn't god just stand over there
[36:11] before
[36:12] the beginning and say i'm gonna have
[36:14] this line
[36:15] you're gonna have that line we'll fight
[36:17] down there at the end
[36:19] no cause that's what happened anyway
[36:23] right all right so let's go
[36:28] everybody gotta put your thinking caps
[36:29] on now because i can't read a lot of
[36:31] quotes
[36:33] and i don't have a whole lot of bible
[36:36] but it's all in the bible
[36:38] nobody got that uh what are you talking
[36:41] about well brother dale
[36:42] he explained it really good this morning
[36:45] if you have a
[36:46] if you have a problem with this go back
[36:47] and listen to this morning
[36:49] what a foundation he was in other words
[36:52] adam the first man in the lower
[36:53] creations of god
[36:55] the first creation was god himself
[36:59] now let's stop right there because
[37:03] god is an object of worship correct
[37:07] he had to have something to worship him
[37:10] brother brown said there was nothing he
[37:12] was elohim e-l-o
[37:14] elohim self-existing god right
[37:18] what made him god
[37:24] you better think back
[37:27] lucifer wasn't created like 35 000 down
[37:30] the line
[37:32] i'm gonna read you right here in a
[37:33] minute where lucifer was god's
[37:35] right-hand man
[37:39] to my idea and my revelation
[37:42] the first thing that made god god was
[37:44] the devil
[37:48] was that okay because lucifer was
[37:51] created
[37:53] i just read it to you in the day you
[37:55] were created
[37:57] so lucifer was the first creation
[38:01] besides the first creation was god
[38:03] himself like brother dale said
[38:05] he covered he you couldn't explain him
[38:08] now i think we're able to explain him
[38:12] he steps out and he's not some floating
[38:15] blob
[38:17] of goo because if we were made in his
[38:20] image he had to be a man
[38:23] everybody with me never was if he was
[38:26] another
[38:27] something besides a man he changed
[38:30] right but you and i had to have a
[38:34] prophet to tell us that
[38:35] he wasn't god yet he was elohim
[38:40] there was no angels because what did
[38:42] brother brown say he said god's first
[38:44] creation was angels
[38:45] you've got to put lucifer in there and
[38:48] you've got to put him number one
[38:50] because i'm going to read you right here
[38:52] in just a minute from demonology
[38:54] satan is god he created lucifer to be
[38:58] his right-hand man
[39:02] so what made god god from elohim
[39:05] lucifer the very one he wanted
[39:10] god wanted to use but he knew when he
[39:12] created him
[39:14] what was going to happen because we'll
[39:16] read it a little bit later on he said
[39:18] though
[39:18] iniquity you were perfect until iniquity
[39:22] was found in you
[39:23] what's iniquity iniquity is knowing to
[39:26] do better not doing it or doing it and
[39:27] knowing you shouldn't do it
[39:29] satan should have knew lucifer should
[39:32] have knew that he can't go above
[39:33] create a created being he was a created
[39:36] being he couldn't go above a creator
[39:39] he should have known that but remember
[39:41] that turned into iniquity so what
[39:42] happens is this is my thought okay we're
[39:44] going to go with this because look
[39:46] then out of god so satan must have
[39:48] already been there
[39:51] lucifer let's read it some of you a
[39:53] little cross-eyed there for a minute
[39:55] let's look on here
[39:57] let's let the prophet tell us right here
[40:00] let's go to number nine skip ezekiel 28.
[40:06] then we'll go back and read the seal of
[40:08] the antichrist 1955.
[40:11] go down to the right there did you know
[40:14] that in heaven
[40:16] that the devil was god's right-hand man
[40:19] in the beginning that lucifer the son of
[40:24] the morning was given
[40:25] power
[40:32] right-hand man
[40:36] and he was the anointed cherub he knew
[40:40] how to worship
[40:41] but what he did he turned that worship
[40:43] away from the creator
[40:46] and wanted it for himself so you
[40:49] see it and that's another thing you have
[40:50] we gonna have to be careful when we
[40:52] start talking about fallen angels
[40:54] because remember all angels must have
[40:56] had a choice
[40:58] right they're not human but remember
[41:01] satan got about a third of them or so
[41:03] what to go with him
[41:05] we'll read it in just a minute but look
[41:09] the devil was god's right-hand man in
[41:12] the beginning
[41:13] lucifer the son of the morning was given
[41:15] power and the reason that he brought sin
[41:17] into the world
[41:18] watch he was not able to create
[41:22] evil because he's not a creator
[41:26] but he took what god created
[41:32] and perverted it back into an evil thing
[41:36] which started all this trouble in the
[41:38] beginning
[41:40] now remember you gotta you say oh that
[41:41] was when he he entered the beast
[41:46] i'm talking about the beginning before
[41:48] time
[41:50] because my bible says michael and
[41:52] lucifer fought way before then
[41:55] right so here we got to go before the
[41:58] beginning
[41:59] we're not even in the garden of eden yet
[42:00] he hadn't got down to eve yet
[42:03] because his evil started where
[42:10] it's on one of my last quote sin did not
[42:12] originate on earth
[42:15] sin originated in heaven
[42:18] that's why heaven and earth's got to
[42:19] pass away that heaven
[42:21] not the eternal one that heaven because
[42:24] i believe that's what god didn't step
[42:26] out of eternity he just stepped over and
[42:28] he said all right
[42:30] i'm getting ready to bring something
[42:31] forth but i want y'all to remember
[42:33] something real quick
[42:35] satan did not change god's plan
[42:38] one bit because it wasn't an idea that
[42:40] god had god didn't say
[42:41] well i got this idea i'm gonna create
[42:42] this next guy and this guy's gonna be
[42:44] just like me without creation he's gonna
[42:46] just take care of everything and
[42:47] everything's gonna be just wonderful
[42:48] it's gonna be a garden of eden
[42:49] and we're just gonna have a wonderful
[42:50] time no he knew he had to create satan
[42:54] though or lucifer
[42:56] and let him make a choice right so that
[42:59] puts everybody because you say oh bob
[43:02] doesn't the bible tell us that we
[43:05] will judge angels now why would there be
[43:08] a judgment of angels if there wasn't a
[43:09] right or wrong to them
[43:12] everybody putting this together are we
[43:13] okay we're not we're not way out we're
[43:15] not way out on a limb somewhere
[43:18] is that all right we will judge angels
[43:21] what they're going to come before us and
[43:23] we're going to judge them by what they
[43:25] do
[43:30] but satan couldn't create and that's
[43:31] what made him mad
[43:33] i believe because then what did he do he
[43:36] said okay buddy
[43:38] what you create i'm going to pervert
[43:42] i'm going to turn it into something i
[43:44] like
[43:45] [Music]
[43:46] i'm going to turn it into something that
[43:48] i want to do
[43:49] because remember we'll read a little bit
[43:51] later on
[43:52] here in isaiah how art they're falling
[43:55] from heaven oh lucifer
[44:00] satan has got to actually ascend to go
[44:03] back to be like god
[44:05] a sin because he's already been kicked
[44:07] out of heaven right
[44:08] so i got a little ahead of myself so
[44:09] let's go back to ezekiel let's go back
[44:12] to number eight
[44:13] the first creation was god himself
[44:17] there you go first creation was god
[44:19] himself all right so
[44:20] why is that god now has become an object
[44:22] of worship because there's something
[44:24] there to worship him right all the
[44:26] angels
[44:28] i i'm not gonna i'm gonna go out a limb
[44:31] god god didn't create angels and then
[44:34] stop saying i'll create some more or i
[44:35] need some more
[44:37] god's not like that that would mean god
[44:39] would have an idea or his thought
[44:40] process would not be eternal
[44:43] his eternal thought process boom there
[44:45] were all the angels
[44:47] he created them gave them the ability
[44:51] to be anointed because they're spirits
[44:56] but they're real brother braham said
[44:58] don't you worry
[44:59] they're real remember he let his son see
[45:03] one of them
[45:04] the angel lord let his son see one demon
[45:06] that was some kind of demon so he looked
[45:08] like that alley-oop guy on the con
[45:10] now most people don't even know what a
[45:11] cartoon is but they used to be in the
[45:13] paper and alley-oop was a
[45:15] kind of a danny's laughing because he
[45:17] knows he used to be a caveman looking
[45:19] god well that's what that demon looked
[45:20] like
[45:21] see they all were created though to
[45:22] worship god
[45:26] god can't create something perverted now
[45:32] let me tell you something else
[45:33] that we're real quiet here because i
[45:35] said i don't have no quote i'm stepping
[45:37] out
[45:37] i'm going out on a limb because listen
[45:42] god did not make those angels
[45:46] eternal
[45:51] why would we have to judge them at the
[45:52] end
[45:56] scratch that beard ball got that beard
[46:00] he didn't make him eternal because a
[46:02] third of them fell right right
[46:05] and satan lucifer whatever you want to
[46:07] call him satan lucifer
[46:08] devil whatever you want to call him
[46:10] lucifer i guess they put it back
[46:12] more to lucifer was god's right-hand man
[46:15] but so here's lucifer standing there
[46:19] got all the power to do whatever he
[46:21] wants to do
[46:23] except create right and now let's
[46:27] interject
[46:28] right inside here right there we had
[46:31] satan come on the scene or lucifer
[46:33] everybody got that say ma'am if you
[46:35] don't agree with me brother they'll
[46:37] straighten me out you don't worry about
[46:38] it
[46:39] okay i may get a chicken house call
[46:43] terror so you don't ever want them
[46:44] chicken house calls
[46:46] so he said come on let's go to chicken
[46:48] house you know you're fishing to get
[46:49] something
[46:51] so i'm not afraid that this would go any
[46:54] further
[46:55] if it's wrong okay all right so the
[46:58] first creation was god himself
[47:01] who was part of that lucifer he created
[47:04] something to make him god now is
[47:06] everybody okay with that because
[47:07] remember he was having him go back and
[47:08] read all your quotes
[47:10] he was elohim self-existent nothing
[47:12] going on
[47:13] nothing and then all of a sudden then
[47:14] brother branham you brought the other
[47:15] quote the other day where brother baby
[47:16] said
[47:17] first creation was what angels to
[47:19] worship him
[47:21] had to be lucifer and all the angels
[47:23] even the third that fell
[47:25] right had to be created but now remember
[47:28] watch this
[47:30] this is what really helps me
[47:34] they were given a life but they weren't
[47:37] given eternal life
[47:39] right everybody got that right man
[47:42] now see an animal's given life
[47:46] but not a human life and definitely not
[47:48] an eternal life
[47:49] right so god is life yes
[47:53] but he's not all eternal life
[47:59] when you come on this earth you got a
[48:02] life
[48:02] right and he wasn't eternal life
[48:06] adam got life wasn't eternal remember he
[48:09] was created a living soul
[48:11] and then god put that genesis 1 26 man
[48:14] inside of adam
[48:16] that's where a lot of people don't agree
[48:17] with that but i agree 100
[48:19] if he just said boom there's my man
[48:22] there's adam
[48:24] no adam was created a man
[48:27] and then the breath or that genesis 1 26
[48:31] man which we may get to today may not
[48:34] went into adam to make him what an
[48:36] eternal son
[48:38] an eternal son of god in his soul not in
[48:42] his body
[48:43] not in spirit in his soul
[48:48] i mean you know you you have to when we
[48:50] do this you have to piece all these
[48:51] quotes together because
[48:53] brother branham said one day adam will
[48:55] reach over and grab ahold of eve
[48:57] evil grab hold of seth set and then
[49:00] we'll head right up to glory well now
[49:01] they
[49:02] ain't going to glory without the holy
[49:03] ghost
[49:05] so they had the holy ghost that's when i
[49:08] said to others sunday i said you know
[49:10] eve was deceived and she said
[49:11] she had the holy ghost in her soul but
[49:13] she just wasn't taught she was a baby
[49:15] she wasn't a baby but she was a baby and
[49:17] she didn't have anything
[49:18] she didn't have anything to work on you
[49:20] and i have something to work with we
[49:22] have the bible we have the word of god
[49:24] at that time she just had adam
[49:27] okay so the first creation was god
[49:29] himself so here
[49:30] lucifer comes on the scene lucifer comes
[49:33] on the scene
[49:34] but all of a sudden
[49:37] here comes something called the logos
[49:43] and satan's standing over there looking
[49:44] at it lucifer
[49:48] and he's watching it say
[49:51] let there be and boom there's a universe
[49:56] let there be there's a son
[49:59] and no lucifer's over here going
[50:02] hey i want to do that
[50:05] i i want to do that
[50:09] and god's going didn't create you for
[50:12] that
[50:13] stay in your position right
[50:17] stay in your position satan's going
[50:21] i can't stand it that thing's over there
[50:23] and it's creating
[50:25] and i don't know where it come from and
[50:28] i don't know what's going on
[50:29] but i want to do that same thing
[50:33] and god's going i created you to worship
[50:36] me
[50:37] that's all i want you to do
[50:40] and satan in his in his in in i just
[50:43] read it
[50:45] he was god's right-hand man but iniquity
[50:47] was found in and we'll read a little bit
[50:49] later
[50:49] in two different places ezekiel and
[50:52] in isaiah 14
[50:56] and they're revelations 12. it proves
[50:59] satan
[51:00] fought with michael and had to be driven
[51:02] out of heaven
[51:03] well that's the same thing happened now
[51:04] but i want to watch now watch this when
[51:06] that logos came out to speak
[51:09] it wasn't a different person it wasn't a
[51:11] different personality
[51:12] you say oh i believe this is where satan
[51:16] got the trinity
[51:16] idea from because he's standing there
[51:19] watching
[51:21] he sees this form here and he sees
[51:23] another form go out of that form
[51:26] then he sees another form go out of that
[51:28] form
[51:30] he says there's one
[51:33] we know that the bible says the devils
[51:35] believe in one god and tremble
[51:39] but satan what perverts that
[51:43] by coming down here and telling us
[51:44] there's a father
[51:46] and there's a son and there's a holy
[51:48] spirit
[51:49] i think i'll make them believe that
[51:52] because it ain't true
[51:53] remember he doesn't do much he doesn't
[51:55] like truth very well
[51:58] he he doesn't like truth very well so he
[52:00] likes to pervert truth
[52:02] so here's this halo of lightning starts
[52:04] creating and satan's like i want to do
[52:06] that well he gets so mad he gets in a
[52:08] fight with that logos
[52:10] i'm here correct me if i'm wrong that
[52:12] logos couldn't be nobody but michael
[52:15] christ and they fought right
[52:18] i'm sorry my two lamb and they fought
[52:21] we're gonna read it i'm gonna read it
[52:22] real quick in revelations
[52:24] i'm jumping around brother joe i'm sorry
[52:26] revelation 12 7 said there was war in
[52:27] heaven and michael and his angels
[52:30] fought against the dragon and the dragon
[52:33] fought
[52:34] and his angels and prevailed
[52:38] not neither was there a place found
[52:41] anymore
[52:42] in heaven yeah because you know what
[52:46] satan couldn't pervert anything in
[52:47] heaven
[52:51] he said i think i'll go to earth there's
[52:54] some people down there that need some
[52:56] that has to make a choice just like i
[52:57] did
[52:57] and i'm going to influence them can't
[53:00] make them
[53:02] but i'm going to influence them guess
[53:04] what and the great dragon was cast out
[53:06] that old serpent called the devil and
[53:08] satan which deceiveth
[53:10] the whole world he was cast
[53:14] out into the earth and his angels were
[53:16] cast out with him
[53:18] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[53:19] heaven now it's come salvation and
[53:21] strength and the kingdom of our god and
[53:22] the power of his christ
[53:24] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[53:26] down which accused them before our god
[53:27] day and night
[53:29] and they overcame him by what the blood
[53:31] of the lamb and the word of their
[53:32] testimony
[53:33] they love not their lives unto death
[53:35] therefore rejoice ye heavens
[53:37] and ye that dwell in them
[53:41] woe to the inhabitants of the earth and
[53:43] of the sea for the devil has come down
[53:45] unto you having great wrath because he
[53:49] knoweth that he has
[53:51] but a short time let's read isaiah 14.
[53:54] you don't believe satan's down here
[53:55] watch this
[53:56] how aren't thy fallen from heaven o
[53:59] lucifer
[54:01] you lost your position but god didn't
[54:05] take away his power
[54:06] right yeah he needed it
[54:12] but remember stop right here real quick
[54:16] god didn't give lucifer eternal life he
[54:19] gave him life
[54:21] he gave the angels life not eternal life
[54:25] now this is why i love to genesis 1 26
[54:28] that's why satan can't understand
[54:30] genesis 1 26 because
[54:32] that man is not just life
[54:38] that always was with him that was with
[54:40] him when he was elohim that's why elohim
[54:42] it says 30 times in the book of genesis
[54:45] even after he says let us make man in
[54:47] our own image he still was
[54:49] god not lord god because that's
[54:52] elohim self-existing even though that
[54:55] group of people
[54:57] was brought forth the genesis 1 26 man
[55:01] he continued to be one god
[55:04] he continued to be elohim self-existing
[55:06] because that genesis 1 26 man
[55:09] wasn't created on the sixth day
[55:13] your 2-7 man was on the sixth day
[55:16] everybody got that am i losing anybody
[55:17] everybody okay
[55:19] genesis 1 26 man never was a day
[55:22] it was not a part of eternal god amen
[55:26] folks that is why you're so special
[55:30] that's a reservation that god had
[55:33] talking about a secret see that's the
[55:35] secret that satan couldn't understand
[55:37] because when that logos went out
[55:41] it had power to create it had power to
[55:44] give eternal life
[55:47] satan couldn't do that so i'm going to
[55:50] pervert this
[55:52] i hate this man now that created me
[55:56] so i'm going to take everything he
[55:58] touches and i'm going to pervert it
[56:01] and i'm going to make a third of the
[56:03] angels believe my lie
[56:06] remember it said he took his tail and
[56:07] sweeped him out brother brown said it
[56:08] wasn't
[56:09] a lie it was deli and the tail that
[56:12] satan told not his literal tale
[56:14] it was a tail that he told t-a-l-e
[56:18] what he deceived him right yeah you
[56:20] never heard that before
[56:21] well it hit me three days ago good boy
[56:24] it didn't hurt you did it but it was a
[56:26] tale he told it wasn't his t-a-i-l saint
[56:29] don't have a t-a-i-l
[56:30] but he has a tail t-a-l-e that he told a
[56:33] third of the angels
[56:35] and they believed him and they were
[56:38] cast out how aren't they falling from
[56:40] heaven oh lucifer now it's not just him
[56:41] when you say
[56:42] lucifer you've got to include his angels
[56:46] he didn't just come down here by himself
[56:48] and leave no it says they all were cast
[56:50] out of heaven
[56:51] down to here now not down to here to go
[56:54] into a human being and become a human
[56:57] being brother brown said can't do that
[56:58] because that would make him a creator
[57:01] can't do that but he can pervert and
[57:03] that's what he did when you
[57:04] were born you were born with life
[57:07] l-i-f-e
[57:08] remember i preached a long time ago two
[57:10] lives paul said the life i now live
[57:14] so that must mean he lived one before
[57:16] the life i used to live was a life given
[57:19] of god now
[57:20] the genesis 1 26 man always was there
[57:24] but you didn't have it in possession or
[57:26] it would have made you something special
[57:28] what makes you something special is when
[57:29] you say god
[57:31] i've gone long enough in this life that
[57:33] i'm living now
[57:34] thank you for giving me breath
[57:38] because your parents didn't give you
[57:39] breath your parents gave you a body
[57:42] god had to give you life but now god
[57:45] thank you that you give me this life so
[57:47] that i can make a choice to get eternal
[57:49] life
[57:51] and you got it there already it was way
[57:54] back when he was elohim it was way
[57:58] well before satan was even created look
[58:00] how he preserved you and me
[58:04] all that i'm like i'm to make spoken
[58:07] word church shout out
[58:11] now listen i'll go with you on that you
[58:13] always was that part always was eternal
[58:15] yeah that's not just regular life
[58:19] right that's right angel's got regular
[58:22] life
[58:23] looser got lucifer got regular life
[58:26] human beings got regular life
[58:28] that's why brother brown said if you're
[58:29] not born again you're cannon fodder
[58:32] one day your soul is just gonna go away
[58:33] it's just life
[58:36] come on look how special you are though
[58:40] because of god not because something you
[58:41] did
[58:43] god preserved you that genesis 1 26 man
[58:45] will never fall
[58:47] it'll never be
[58:52] he'll never be a part of satan this
[58:55] might be
[58:56] the first life if you didn't serve him
[59:00] pray for me i did
[59:02] yeah i hear some of you say yeah we all
[59:05] did
[59:06] we all served that first life we that
[59:09] was a perverted life
[59:11] it came into this earth perfect just
[59:13] like he gave lucifer
[59:14] perfect life i just read it
[59:19] i created you the day that i was created
[59:21] i created you
[59:22] perfect
[59:26] that's why all children babies before
[59:28] the age of accountability go to heaven
[59:31] god can't judge them for not knowing
[59:33] right from wrong
[59:35] so you get a perfect life from god tell
[59:37] me where else life comes from brother
[59:39] brown said life comes from nobody but
[59:40] god
[59:42] but he didn't give you eternal life when
[59:44] you first was born or you do away with
[59:46] redemption
[59:49] he had to redeem those that had fallen
[59:53] he made a sacrifice for adam and eve
[59:56] before the foundation of the world
[59:58] even while he was god elohim in his mind
[1:00:02] he died on cross i got to go die for
[1:00:05] those people because i know what they're
[1:00:06] going to do
[1:00:07] but all what a great time that we're
[1:00:09] going to have when we connect back up
[1:00:11] over here in the end i might be
[1:00:14] separated for thousands of years because
[1:00:16] of this guy that i know was going to do
[1:00:18] what he was going to do
[1:00:21] but i'm going to have my plan anyway
[1:00:24] actually he was in my plan all along
[1:00:27] amen
[1:00:33] how are falling from heaven oh lucifer
[1:00:35] sun of the morning
[1:00:38] how art thou cut down to the ground
[1:00:39] which does weaken weakened
[1:00:41] nations oh he thinks he's got it whip
[1:00:44] now he's got all the gold he's got
[1:00:45] people in his
[1:00:46] corner he's got power on earth
[1:00:50] for thou has said in thine heart
[1:00:53] remember god knows everything he knew
[1:00:55] the very thoughts of lucifer before he
[1:00:57] created him
[1:01:02] he knew it for thou has said in thine
[1:01:05] heart
[1:01:06] i will get back up there somehow
[1:01:10] he's so full of himself
[1:01:14] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:01:17] of god
[1:01:18] remember that's where he was at to begin
[1:01:19] with
[1:01:21] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:01:23] of god
[1:01:24] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[1:01:27] congregation
[1:01:30] hmm congregation's people
[1:01:34] in the sides of the north i will ascend
[1:01:37] above the heights of the clouds look at
[1:01:40] all them
[1:01:40] eyes now look i love it when god says i
[1:01:44] will
[1:01:46] but i don't like it when that guy says
[1:01:47] it i love it when god says i will i will
[1:01:51] save you if you'll just accept me but
[1:01:52] now that guy's saying i will
[1:01:55] cause listen it's a lie
[1:01:58] it's all a lie right
[1:02:02] i will ascend above the heights of the
[1:02:04] clowns i will be like the most high
[1:02:07] yet thou shalt be brought down to hell
[1:02:09] to the sides of the pit
[1:02:11] they that see thee shall narrowly look
[1:02:13] upon thee
[1:02:14] and consider thee saying is this the man
[1:02:16] that made the earth to tremble
[1:02:18] that did shake kingdoms one day we'll
[1:02:22] look at satan he'll be laying on the
[1:02:23] side of a road
[1:02:25] a drunk all beat up and and just awful
[1:02:28] looking guy
[1:02:29] but that guy is the one that tormented
[1:02:31] you right you on your whole earthly
[1:02:33] journey
[1:02:35] that's what that guy did but he had no
[1:02:37] power he's telling you right now this is
[1:02:40] they that see these shall narrowly look
[1:02:41] upon them consider these saying is this
[1:02:43] the man
[1:02:44] is this the man i feared all my life the
[1:02:47] boogeyman the devil
[1:02:48] the demons no
[1:02:53] everybody okay man everybody good
[1:02:57] let's go back to uh number eight uh
[1:03:02] well joe thank you brother anderson
[1:03:05] i think long arms is back there i'm
[1:03:07] pretty sure he is
[1:03:09] so the first creation was god himself
[1:03:12] then there was angels to worship him
[1:03:14] then we see what happened is as god came
[1:03:16] out to create and all these things
[1:03:17] started happening
[1:03:18] satan got worse mad and worse man to me
[1:03:21] i'm just saying that's why he just got
[1:03:22] so mad
[1:03:23] that he could not be a part of that
[1:03:27] and see that's why god hates a christian
[1:03:29] i mean sorry satan hates a christian
[1:03:33] he can't get in your soul he can
[1:03:37] torment you all he can in the flesh and
[1:03:39] if you let him in his spirit in your
[1:03:40] spirit
[1:03:41] but he cannot once you're born again
[1:03:43] there's no way satan can get his grimy
[1:03:45] hands
[1:03:46] around any of that it's like touching a
[1:03:49] 10
[1:03:49] billion volt wire
[1:03:54] see how important it is getting you bark
[1:03:58] amen it's the logos it's the ain't the
[1:04:02] son of god the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:06] in the son of god the baptism of the
[1:04:08] holy that thing that said
[1:04:10] let there be i know satan was standing
[1:04:14] there out in the woods
[1:04:15] with brother branham i know he was there
[1:04:18] because he's everywhere that's right and
[1:04:21] my brother brown said
[1:04:24] let there be a squirrel come out on the
[1:04:27] end of that limb
[1:04:31] thinking got mad because he can't do
[1:04:33] that
[1:04:35] and you say i know satan's going how in
[1:04:38] the world
[1:04:40] i perverted that guy i i made him do
[1:04:44] him you all of us i made them do all
[1:04:46] that but look at them now
[1:04:47] i can't get them to hold a beer in their
[1:04:49] hand i can't get them to say a cursed
[1:04:52] word
[1:04:53] i can't keep them out of church i can't
[1:04:58] huh why because you don't have that life
[1:05:02] anymore
[1:05:05] that's what we were talking about the
[1:05:06] other day permitted power
[1:05:08] that's exoce of power
[1:05:11] you can't have dunamis power and not be
[1:05:13] of god
[1:05:15] dunamis power is eternal exosia power is
[1:05:18] not we already covered that
[1:05:20] and that's what he gave lucifer he
[1:05:21] didn't give loose for eternal power
[1:05:24] but he did you and that's what lucifer
[1:05:27] hates folks that's why
[1:05:28] he's come out of all them out there
[1:05:32] he's comfortable
[1:05:35] he's not comfortable when he comes in
[1:05:37] here but he wants to be so much like
[1:05:40] us what do you got that i don't god
[1:05:44] why can you pray and and this this and
[1:05:47] i'm going to say this loosely this
[1:05:49] thing that created me comes and helps
[1:05:51] you
[1:05:52] you know satan's that's his whole thing
[1:05:55] he hates god
[1:05:57] right he hates anything that's righteous
[1:06:01] so he don't just take it and put you in
[1:06:03] a beer joint and put you in a
[1:06:05] i'm going to say it whorehouse he put
[1:06:08] you in church
[1:06:11] that's what we're facing now
[1:06:14] but that son of god the logos which was
[1:06:16] the son of god came
[1:06:18] out and started creating
[1:06:21] and then all of a sudden here's adam
[1:06:28] satan's going where'd he come from
[1:06:35] because he's a spiritual being remember
[1:06:37] first adam
[1:06:39] the genesis 1 26 man spiritual being
[1:06:42] first
[1:06:43] where'd that come from satan's got all
[1:06:46] these problems
[1:06:47] he can't he can't understand where's all
[1:06:50] this come from that
[1:06:51] that i'm supposed to be god's right-hand
[1:06:53] man
[1:06:55] well you were until iniquity was found
[1:06:58] in you is what the bible says
[1:07:00] you were fine lucifer
[1:07:04] until you decided
[1:07:07] to do what you did and now he hates
[1:07:10] everything
[1:07:11] that god does remember he hates it
[1:07:14] because he wants to exalt himself above
[1:07:16] right he don't want to be equal not
[1:07:19] anymore he wants to go above
[1:07:21] but look then out of the logos which was
[1:07:23] the word
[1:07:24] remember satan can't be anything in the
[1:07:27] word except
[1:07:28] written there he can't be the word made
[1:07:30] flesh
[1:07:32] amen you can be
[1:07:36] jesus is you can be the word made flesh
[1:07:39] but he can't
[1:07:41] and he can't even stand to look at the
[1:07:43] bible because every time he looks in the
[1:07:44] bible he sees his end
[1:07:46] he sees his destruction he sees the
[1:07:49] whole story what an unbeliever
[1:07:51] then out of the logos came forth to man
[1:07:54] so satan goes one two three that
[1:07:56] looks like three different people i
[1:07:57] think i'll just twist that and pervert
[1:07:59] it
[1:07:59] and i'll just feed it to him and you
[1:08:01] know what
[1:08:02] the people ate it amen
[1:08:06] the people ate it up and it ain't
[1:08:08] brother brown said that doctrine came
[1:08:09] from
[1:08:10] what hell
[1:08:13] and who's there what's satan
[1:08:16] so he created that doctrine because
[1:08:19] before the beginning
[1:08:20] he was standing there and he watched all
[1:08:22] these attributes of god
[1:08:24] you say how can that happen you tell me
[1:08:26] one thing
[1:08:27] you know i believe that god is faster
[1:08:29] than the speed of light
[1:08:31] speed of light's 120 000 miles per
[1:08:33] second i'll thank you what did right
[1:08:36] how can he be so fast as to
[1:08:39] come and help me in my need and then
[1:08:42] give the baptism a holy ghost to
[1:08:43] somebody in china
[1:08:45] just like that or appear to somebody
[1:08:48] just like that he was so he was so much
[1:08:51] faster than even satan because remember
[1:08:54] satan was a created being god so fast he
[1:08:57] could jump over here and create
[1:08:58] everything you say how in the world
[1:08:59] brother brown said on the day of
[1:09:01] pentecost god
[1:09:03] divided his self brother dale was
[1:09:06] covering it this morning
[1:09:07] god makes himself more powerful by
[1:09:10] dividing himself
[1:09:13] that's what satan can't stand because
[1:09:14] satan can't create
[1:09:16] so he can't multiply except to anoint
[1:09:20] that's why in the end time that's why
[1:09:21] he's so so
[1:09:23] so deceiving he can anoint you to think
[1:09:27] you've got what you don't got
[1:09:30] i don't know that wasn't bad that wasn't
[1:09:31] good english but it got the point across
[1:09:35] because look satan was right here folks
[1:09:38] he was standing here because remember he
[1:09:40] would
[1:09:40] that's why when we dropped down into the
[1:09:42] beginning of time
[1:09:43] before the beginning of time satan's
[1:09:46] going hmm
[1:09:49] all right so if i can get some of my
[1:09:50] people together
[1:09:53] i hate thinking like the devil he you
[1:09:56] can't
[1:09:56] i'm gonna get my people together and i
[1:09:58] can't create
[1:10:00] but now remember god before he created
[1:10:03] human man created the animals
[1:10:07] gave them a life and told them to
[1:10:09] multiply and replenish the earth
[1:10:12] sexually male and a female and nothing's
[1:10:15] wrong with that
[1:10:17] nothing would have been wrong with adam
[1:10:18] and eve
[1:10:20] what brother brown said was adultery was
[1:10:22] the right act
[1:10:24] perverted who perverts it satan
[1:10:28] all right so you come to the time where
[1:10:30] he's going all right
[1:10:32] i can't create but i got to get myself
[1:10:36] in the human race
[1:10:40] i got to get in there somehow cause i
[1:10:42] can't i've tried my best to get adam
[1:10:46] now look i don't think adam was totally
[1:10:49] hands off
[1:10:51] i think the beast talked to him too but
[1:10:54] he couldn't get to him
[1:10:57] amen because he's typing christ
[1:11:00] couldn't get to him but he could get to
[1:11:02] the bride
[1:11:04] he could get to eve because she was
[1:11:05] emotional
[1:11:07] she had emotions satan could work on
[1:11:09] that emotion
[1:11:11] because he's seen the whole thing he
[1:11:13] sees listen folks he's what
[1:11:14] since before the beginning he's been
[1:11:17] there
[1:11:19] and when when god said in genesis 1 let
[1:11:22] us make man our own image and in our
[1:11:24] likeness and let them
[1:11:25] let them multiply satan just tells eve
[1:11:29] says
[1:11:32] i don't see any multiplication going on
[1:11:35] here
[1:11:36] god told you to multiply i was there
[1:11:38] when he said it
[1:11:40] see what i mean how slick he is so he
[1:11:43] took it by
[1:11:44] a natural seed listen you and i were
[1:11:46] supposed to be born by
[1:11:47] spiritual the spoken word is the
[1:11:50] original seed
[1:11:52] no sex involved but satan knew he could
[1:11:55] enter in through that line because god
[1:11:56] had created
[1:11:57] animals to be able to do that real
[1:11:59] simple to me
[1:12:00] when you see that but in the beginning
[1:12:03] was the word and the word was with god
[1:12:04] and the word was god and the word was
[1:12:05] made flesh that's what satan can't do
[1:12:07] and he can't stand
[1:12:09] right it's for you to get born again
[1:12:12] why because he's lost you
[1:12:15] he's lost you forever he's lost you for
[1:12:17] an eternity
[1:12:19] you can't be touched by satan anymore on
[1:12:21] the inside guy
[1:12:23] you even in the sixth dimension i don't
[1:12:25] believe satan can wander around in that
[1:12:26] sixth dimension no no no no no no no
[1:12:29] that's perfect love i heard brother i'm
[1:12:31] saying just on the quote this morning on
[1:12:33] the
[1:12:33] on the video here that's perfect love
[1:12:37] that's where satan can't get to right he
[1:12:40] can go up and down all over the earth he
[1:12:42] can go around he can go in the fifth
[1:12:44] dimension he can do
[1:12:45] that sixth dimension he cannot go in
[1:12:48] now i believe he's still going to
[1:12:49] seventh dimension for right now
[1:12:52] because that's where god is but remember
[1:12:55] in the book of job
[1:12:57] god said hey satan
[1:13:00] where you been he said i've been going
[1:13:03] up and down through the earth
[1:13:04] remember what it says you know up and
[1:13:05] down through the earth and doing he said
[1:13:07] hey if you consider my servant job so he
[1:13:08] had to be talking to him
[1:13:10] why because listen lucifer was his
[1:13:14] right-hand man at one time
[1:13:18] so let's read this real quick ezekiel 28
[1:13:20] verse 11.
[1:13:21] everybody all right i mean i'm telling
[1:13:25] you it's just i kind of stepped down on
[1:13:26] the limb here but i
[1:13:27] i just feel that if if you're gonna if
[1:13:30] we're gonna talk about two spirits we
[1:13:31] need to know them from the beginning
[1:13:33] before the beginning like brother dale
[1:13:36] was talking about the beginning of the
[1:13:37] creation of god
[1:13:39] all right now remember again
[1:13:43] the word created in genesis 1 26 that
[1:13:46] man was never
[1:13:46] created as lucifer was created
[1:13:52] everybody understand that right because
[1:13:54] lucifer was created
[1:13:55] a spiritual being but not eternal now
[1:13:58] genesis 1 26 man is an
[1:13:59] eternal person and it's jesus christ
[1:14:04] everybody got that i mean that's the
[1:14:06] logos whatever
[1:14:07] son of god whatever you want to say
[1:14:09] because that was you that was your birth
[1:14:10] that was your new birth not the birth
[1:14:12] you had before
[1:14:14] so it's got to be that you say well
[1:14:17] where did the two seeds come from
[1:14:20] before the beginning do you want to say
[1:14:23] see when we say seed i don't want us to
[1:14:26] we say seed we always go to a
[1:14:28] sperm or a germ or a little bitty some
[1:14:30] little grain of something
[1:14:33] the bible tells me that the seed is the
[1:14:35] word of god
[1:14:37] and anti-seed must be anti-word
[1:14:44] because there's only two then if
[1:14:47] but if we go to that though then we're
[1:14:50] all done for
[1:14:52] if there's two seed lines and they're
[1:14:55] natural
[1:14:57] and they're natural just two seed lines
[1:14:59] and you can't change two
[1:15:00] you can't make a a germ eternal that was
[1:15:03] born down here
[1:15:05] right right so we're done for
[1:15:08] where are we going what are we doing
[1:15:10] there's another race up there somewhere
[1:15:11] you know that's eternal
[1:15:12] no god said no no
[1:15:15] in the act of redemption remember you
[1:15:18] got to redeem
[1:15:19] that that was lost yes
[1:15:23] not a whole new person
[1:15:26] you understand remember brother brown
[1:15:29] said he don't believe in transmigration
[1:15:30] of souls he didn't migrate your soul
[1:15:33] out he changed yours right he didn't
[1:15:36] exchange it
[1:15:37] he put that eternal life that he spoke
[1:15:40] before the foundation of the world in
[1:15:42] genesis 1.
[1:15:43] he said you've come to that place
[1:15:47] now you're going to be a part of the
[1:15:49] logos
[1:15:50] because why did that little that little
[1:15:52] lick of fire on 120 in the upper room
[1:15:54] why did it say it was a lick of fire it
[1:15:56] was why it was the logos
[1:15:58] the son of god didn't just stay over
[1:16:01] their head and you see these pictures of
[1:16:03] jesus you know they paint and they got
[1:16:04] the
[1:16:05] halo over his head i don't
[1:16:08] listen if a man like that would have
[1:16:12] walked into the temple and there's
[1:16:13] caiaphas being a spiritual man and
[1:16:15] jesus walks in and he's got this halo
[1:16:18] glowing around his head
[1:16:19] they wouldn't have thought he was the
[1:16:20] devil he was a common man
[1:16:24] he had it inside listen that's what
[1:16:27] brother dale's preaching on the secret
[1:16:29] there's a secret the secret is you're
[1:16:32] eternal
[1:16:35] living in a doomed world
[1:16:39] you was born in sin shaping iniquity
[1:16:42] come to this world speaking lies
[1:16:44] drugs perverts whoremongers
[1:16:48] can i be anything else listen to all
[1:16:52] kind of
[1:16:52] perverted stuff did god just kill you no
[1:16:56] way we
[1:16:57] no he just said okay i'm waiting on you
[1:16:59] i've already put something up here for
[1:17:01] you
[1:17:01] i got something right here and i did put
[1:17:04] i did give you an angel to watch over
[1:17:07] you

[1:17:33] every time i go by that place in
[1:17:35] dahlonega i mean in dawsonville
[1:17:37] i think about that evening i had a van
[1:17:41] full
[1:17:41] daddy had a van full and we were coming
[1:17:44] home from brother pageants or somewhere
[1:17:45] up there
[1:17:46] and right there in dawsonville outside
[1:17:48] of dawsonville down that long
[1:17:49] straightaway before you go up the hill
[1:17:51] where the
[1:17:51] forestry commission is over there on the
[1:17:53] right never forget it and they have that
[1:17:55] little
[1:17:56] corn maze thing over there coming back
[1:17:58] home not coming to
[1:17:59] dawsonville going away crossroads right
[1:18:01] there
[1:18:03] i went through it and just a split
[1:18:06] second
[1:18:07] a guy didn't even stop in the stop sign
[1:18:10] he went between me and brother dale
[1:18:14] now folks that split second because i
[1:18:15] was running 55 dad was running 55 we
[1:18:17] were heading home
[1:18:18] we were just far apart
[1:18:22] because i saw i saw in my rearview
[1:18:23] mirror i saw lights go by and then now
[1:18:25] over here i see this red light you know
[1:18:27] he put his brakes on the guy had
[1:18:29] completely run across
[1:18:32] folks one split second not one second
[1:18:35] a split second either
[1:18:39] that's way i've learned this a lot
[1:18:41] brother boyd and then
[1:18:42] we all i just say brother boy because
[1:18:43] you're sitting there if something and uh
[1:18:46] jim's always told me this i you know me
[1:18:49] i want to be on time
[1:18:50] pop wants to be well most of us dale's
[1:18:52] want to be on time
[1:18:53] 99.9999 we want to be on time but if we
[1:18:57] get off for five minutes
[1:18:58] it rattles us a little bit terrorism
[1:19:00] back up shaking ahead
[1:19:01] you better agree one thing's for sure be
[1:19:04] careful
[1:19:05] that may be the five minutes you need
[1:19:07] that god knows you're gonna
[1:19:09] get in the wreck how many times have you
[1:19:11] come up on a wreck
[1:19:12] and it be in front of you five minutes
[1:19:14] or what you understand what i'm saying
[1:19:16] so i have been trying to help myself or
[1:19:19] get god to help me
[1:19:20] that if we're a little bit late james
[1:19:22] you know i'll be a little bit late and
[1:19:23] i'll be
[1:19:24] jim says everything's for a purpose
[1:19:29] but if we would have been one split
[1:19:30] stack if we were to stop
[1:19:32] for one split second or even slow down
[1:19:35] that guy would have either hit me with a
[1:19:37] van load of people on this side
[1:19:39] or hit brother dale van gaal that thing
[1:19:42] went just like it was in a movie
[1:19:45] we were just this far apart maybe from
[1:19:47] here to the to the
[1:19:48] door and that guy slid right between us
[1:19:51] running the stop sign
[1:19:52] right through the right through the uh
[1:19:54] four-way stop
[1:19:56] because i called daddy i said what was
[1:19:57] that he said uh we almost got hit
[1:20:00] he said that guy went right through that
[1:20:02] stop sign
[1:20:03] and didn't realize it until he got away
[1:20:05] from us and then he slammed on his
[1:20:06] brakes well that was a little bit too
[1:20:08] late
[1:20:08] but you know what that's your angel
[1:20:10] that's that's what god has given you
[1:20:13] like i said wednesday night
[1:20:16] when god's done with us we need to go
[1:20:21] but if he's not done with us i don't
[1:20:23] care what satan does
[1:20:26] i don't care what man does you're not
[1:20:30] going
[1:20:30] until god says that's my child and i
[1:20:33] need him home
[1:20:35] i said about brother dale roberts you're
[1:20:37] not going to leave this earth until your
[1:20:39] journey
[1:20:40] that god saw that he foreordained and he
[1:20:43] predestinated
[1:20:47] so should we walk without fear yes but
[1:20:49] we shouldn't be fearless
[1:20:52] let's let's don't go stand out here in
[1:20:55] the road
[1:20:55] no that's tempting god don't do that we
[1:20:59] know better we know better than that but
[1:21:00] listen
[1:21:01] just remember god
[1:21:04] created satan and he turned into the
[1:21:08] devil
[1:21:08] he created lucifer lucifer turned into
[1:21:12] the devil because of what his choice
[1:21:16] you have a choice if the devil had a
[1:21:18] choice that god the creator created to
[1:21:20] be his right hand man had a choice
[1:21:22] all the angels are going to have a
[1:21:24] choice you got a choice so see
[1:21:27] that's why god is a true and just judge
[1:21:31] every person we always think when we
[1:21:33] come to the when we come to the white
[1:21:34] throne which
[1:21:35] thank god we don't have to stand in why
[1:21:37] because genesis 1 26 man's already been
[1:21:39] judged
[1:21:41] he's judged eternal that's right amen
[1:21:45] amen when christ went to calvary he had
[1:21:47] that man in him
[1:21:49] when christ went to hell he had that man
[1:21:52] in him
[1:21:53] and what is that man it's a subdividing
[1:21:55] of itself in his bride
[1:22:00] it's not listen it's not foolish virgin
[1:22:02] eternal life
[1:22:03] right right oh lord it's not a cup of
[1:22:07] water in my name eternal life no they're
[1:22:08] not god's children
[1:22:11] god had a place for his children before
[1:22:13] the foundation of the world
[1:22:15] satan can't touch it to me that's the
[1:22:17] secret
[1:22:19] that's the hidden mystery that god has
[1:22:21] you remember when brother brown got to
[1:22:23] the seventh seal
[1:22:24] and he said you know what he said if i
[1:22:26] say something
[1:22:28] he said satan's going to attack it and
[1:22:29] i'm paraphrasing he said but if i keep
[1:22:32] it inside
[1:22:34] he said satan can't get to that see
[1:22:36] listen satan can't affect your soul
[1:22:41] he cannot it's eternal he's working in
[1:22:45] your spirit your memory reason conscious
[1:22:47] affection imagination
[1:22:48] he's working in that realm he's not
[1:22:50] working in your soul your soul today is
[1:22:52] eternal
[1:22:54] glory thank you lord son of man take up
[1:22:57] a lamentation on the king of tires we're
[1:22:58] going to read the whole thing and we'll
[1:23:00] quit
[1:23:00] give us something else for the next time
[1:23:02] we're not finished at all but
[1:23:05] remember one thing's for sure
[1:23:10] satan was created he's not a creator
[1:23:16] and that has nothing to do with that
[1:23:17] genesis 1 26 man
[1:23:20] when you were born as a baby that was
[1:23:22] not that genesis 1 26 man
[1:23:24] that was life that god had listen you
[1:23:26] say that oh yeah
[1:23:27] remember god has to work under what he
[1:23:29] says
[1:23:31] right remember when remember when the
[1:23:34] man said oh
[1:23:35] eve said i've gotten a man from the lord
[1:23:38] how can that be
[1:23:40] that's right real simple brother brown
[1:23:42] said god's only one can give life
[1:23:45] satan can't give life god give cain his
[1:23:49] life
[1:23:50] but cain chose remember it said when
[1:23:54] they were older
[1:23:54] he didn't judge him as a kid he judged
[1:23:57] them older
[1:23:58] age of accountability he judged them
[1:24:02] though and he said
[1:24:03] cain if you'll do what your brother abel
[1:24:05] did you'll be fine
[1:24:07] right that's bible if you'll do like
[1:24:11] your brother
[1:24:12] so ev what i'm saying everybody is going
[1:24:14] to be judged
[1:24:15] except the bride of jesus christ
[1:24:18] angels lucifer has already had his
[1:24:22] judgment
[1:24:23] and those that follow him but
[1:24:25] everybody's going to be judged
[1:24:27] on what they've done on this earth it
[1:24:30] doesn't matter who except the bride of
[1:24:32] jesus christ
[1:24:33] because it exclude that genesis 1 26 man
[1:24:36] is excluded
[1:24:37] from any fall
[1:24:40] oh that'll make you happy for us
[1:24:43] it never fell life over here fell
[1:24:47] because god said
[1:24:48] every seed shall bring forth of its kind
[1:24:52] so satan goes hmm
[1:24:56] that beast that beast because
[1:24:59] brother brown said that he knew the
[1:25:01] knowledge of the principles of life
[1:25:03] satan did and when he entered that beast
[1:25:07] he said if i can get into that human
[1:25:09] race i'll
[1:25:10] inject a natural seed
[1:25:14] and that's going to turn into my people
[1:25:18] my people that'll be my group
[1:25:23] he was he was fooled
[1:25:26] all for a time yeah he's filling the
[1:25:28] world full of
[1:25:29] full of his people but he ain't going to
[1:25:32] live here
[1:25:33] right son of man take up lamentation on
[1:25:36] king of tires and say unto him thus
[1:25:38] saith the lord
[1:25:38] thou seedless up to some full of wisdom
[1:25:41] don't tell me satan's not
[1:25:42] done he's not dummy and perfect in
[1:25:45] beauty
[1:25:46] though i spent a need in the garden of
[1:25:47] god every precious stone was not
[1:25:49] covering the sardis topaz diamond barrel
[1:25:51] onyx jasper sapphire emerald carbuncle
[1:25:54] and gold see how beautiful he is
[1:25:56] that's why john admired him
[1:25:59] hello everybody in revelations that
[1:26:02] wasn't god's church that was the devil's
[1:26:04] church
[1:26:05] that john admired sitting on that
[1:26:07] scarlet covered
[1:26:08] beast excuse me the workmanship of thy
[1:26:11] tabrets and of thy pipes were prepared
[1:26:13] and then the day that thou was created
[1:26:15] thou art the anointed cherub that
[1:26:18] covereth
[1:26:20] whoa and i have set thee so
[1:26:23] so god gave him a position thou wasted
[1:26:26] upon the holy mountain of god
[1:26:29] thou has walked up and down in the midst
[1:26:31] of the stones
[1:26:32] of fire what's a stone revelation
[1:26:37] but remember god's got a secret
[1:26:40] he's got a secret and it's me and you
[1:26:44] i might have got ahead of you sorry but
[1:26:46] that secret's me and you
[1:26:49] satan cannot create so he can't realize
[1:26:52] how i i'm trying to get you to do the
[1:26:54] things you used to do
[1:26:56] the things i used to do i do them no
[1:27:00] more
[1:27:01] things i used to do i do them no more
[1:27:04] right things i used to do i do them no
[1:27:07] more why
[1:27:08] different life right paul said to life i
[1:27:12] now live
[1:27:13] what he was talking about that genesis 1
[1:27:14] 26 man
[1:27:17] it took over amen
[1:27:21] you've been consumed by the almighty
[1:27:26] you have been consumed by the eternal
[1:27:28] you have been given holy ghost and fire
[1:27:30] to burn out all that and then that
[1:27:33] genesis 1 26 man just comes right in
[1:27:36] thou was perfect in thy ways from the
[1:27:38] day that thou was created
[1:27:40] till iniquity was found in thee by the
[1:27:43] multitude of thy merchandise they have
[1:27:45] filled the midst of thee with violence
[1:27:48] thou has sinned
[1:27:51] thou therefore i will cast thee as
[1:27:53] profane out of the mountain of god
[1:27:56] and i will destroy the old covering
[1:27:58] cherub from the midst of the stones of
[1:28:00] fire
[1:28:01] thine heart was lifted up because of thy
[1:28:03] beauty
[1:28:04] hey i look better than that guy down
[1:28:06] there that that jesus guy he just ain't
[1:28:09] that good looking i'm a better looking
[1:28:11] guy
[1:28:13] that heart was lifted up because of thy
[1:28:14] beauty thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by
[1:28:16] reasons of thy brightness
[1:28:19] because remember we're going to read in
[1:28:21] just a second he was transformed to an
[1:28:22] angel of light
[1:28:24] i will cast thee to the ground i will
[1:28:26] lay thee before kings that
[1:28:28] they may behold thee thou hast defiled
[1:28:31] thy sanctuaries
[1:28:32] always in the church by the multitude of
[1:28:35] thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy
[1:28:37] traffic therefore will i bring forth a
[1:28:39] fire
[1:28:40] from the midst of thee
[1:28:44] god is a consuming fire
[1:28:48] but now what happens hold on a minute
[1:28:50] god did that to me
[1:28:54] but he don't hurt his children
[1:28:57] he cauterizes
[1:29:00] he cauterizes and it don't hurt so bad
[1:29:03] satan he's fixing to when he hits him
[1:29:04] with that fire he's going to destroy him
[1:29:07] because why he was made from a different
[1:29:09] source
[1:29:10] listen if you and i are born again we
[1:29:12] come from that source of that creator
[1:29:14] not from the source of lucifer even
[1:29:16] common man didn't come from physical
[1:29:18] lucifer he has no seed
[1:29:21] he perverts god's seed he perverts god's
[1:29:23] life
[1:29:25] oh it's just oh it's so good
[1:29:28] i will bring forth the fire from the
[1:29:29] midst of the it shall defi it shall
[1:29:31] devour thee and i will bring thee to
[1:29:33] ashes upon the earth
[1:29:34] in the sight of all them that behold
[1:29:36] thee all they that
[1:29:38] know thee among the people shall be
[1:29:40] astonished at thee
[1:29:42] thou shalt be a terror and never shalt
[1:29:44] thou
[1:29:45] be anymore
[1:29:49] never shalt thou be
[1:29:53] anymore let's read one more let's go to

[1:30:00] greatest battle ever fault go to jude 1.
[1:30:02] we'll read some of this a little bit
[1:30:03] later
[1:30:04] i'm sorry i've skipped around a little
[1:30:05] bit look and the angels which kept not
[1:30:07] their first estate now brother brown
[1:30:08] talks about this this is where those
[1:30:09] fallen angels what was their first
[1:30:11] estate god created and perfect
[1:30:12] [Music]
[1:30:15] god give them the state of heaven
[1:30:18] hello wake up just for a minute
[1:30:21] yeah yeah that's right they had a
[1:30:23] position
[1:30:25] stay with your first estate
[1:30:29] but left their own habitation
[1:30:34] hath reserved an everlasting chains
[1:30:35] under darkness and to the judgment
[1:30:38] so they're going to have to be judged of
[1:30:40] that great day
[1:30:42] let's read the greatest battle ever
[1:30:43] fought
[1:30:47] the quote there you go greatest battle
[1:30:48] ever fought in 1962 we'll close right
[1:30:50] here musician get ready to come after
[1:30:51] this
[1:30:52] and i believe that's the greatest battle
[1:30:54] that was ever fought is now ready to go
[1:30:55] into action now why hadn't it been
[1:30:57] before
[1:30:58] remember this is the apex oh yeah
[1:31:01] this is the apex this is the finishing
[1:31:03] of the battle
[1:31:05] between christ and i say christ i mean
[1:31:08] his bride
[1:31:09] because christ is not on earth he's in
[1:31:11] bright form now
[1:31:12] he has immorphied divided himself
[1:31:16] into a bride same logos same god
[1:31:20] same eternal life satan hates that
[1:31:23] because he can't get any of that and
[1:31:25] when he touches it's like touching 20
[1:31:27] million votes with electricity and it's
[1:31:30] now ready to go into action i believe
[1:31:31] that god has been selecting
[1:31:33] his soldiers
[1:31:38] i believe he's been dressing them
[1:31:44] training them remember this is not a
[1:31:47] picnic
[1:31:49] it's a battle and the battlefront is now
[1:31:53] set
[1:31:54] getting ready to start this great first
[1:31:57] battle that was ever fought began in
[1:31:59] heaven
[1:32:00] when michael and his angels fought
[1:32:03] against lucifer and his angels
[1:32:05] it first started the first battle was in
[1:32:07] heaven so
[1:32:08] sin did not originate on earth it
[1:32:10] originated in heaven
[1:32:12] and then it was thrown down from heaven
[1:32:14] cast out of heaven to the earth
[1:32:16] and fell on human beings
[1:32:21] all human beings what
[1:32:24] to anoint you remember if satan is the
[1:32:26] anointed cherub all of his little
[1:32:28] minions they're anointed too
[1:32:32] then the battle from angels became
[1:32:36] human battles
[1:32:40] listen folks they can influence you but
[1:32:43] they can't make you do something
[1:32:47] just like god remember brother brown he
[1:32:48] said even the holy spirit is a timid
[1:32:49] spirit he won't make you do anything
[1:32:53] he'll stand right there and he'll wait
[1:32:55] on you
[1:32:56] look how powerful you are and satan come
[1:32:59] to destroy god's creation what god had
[1:33:01] created to be for himself
[1:33:03] he had satan come to destroy this that's
[1:33:06] what his purpose was was to
[1:33:08] destroy it then the battle began here on
[1:33:10] earth and begin
[1:33:12] in us and has been raging
[1:33:16] ever since huh
[1:33:20] and what's he doing watch this let's go
[1:33:21] to second corinthians 11 we'll read that
[1:33:23] and the musicians come on
[1:33:25] for such are false apostles and
[1:33:27] deceitful workers
[1:33:29] transforming themselves into the
[1:33:32] apostles of christ
[1:33:38] there's your two spirits it's so false
[1:33:41] it's almost real
[1:33:44] no marvel for satan himself is
[1:33:47] transformed
[1:33:48] into an angel of light he can't deceive
[1:33:50] you if he comes as the angel of darkness
[1:33:53] he comes as an angel of light therefore
[1:33:56] it is no
[1:33:57] great thing if his ministers
[1:34:03] also shall be transformed as the
[1:34:06] ministers of righteousness
[1:34:08] whose end shall be according to their
[1:34:12] works we'll bring a scripture next
[1:34:14] sunday musicians come
[1:34:16] you can close it down scripture says
[1:34:19] lord lord have i not cast out devils
[1:34:23] have i not healed the sick have i not
[1:34:26] preached your gospel that's the same
[1:34:28] thing judas did
[1:34:30] and you know what he's going to say
[1:34:33] depart from me
[1:34:35] you never were a part of that genesis 1
[1:34:37] 26 man because i never saw you accept me
[1:34:40] we never had a love affair
[1:34:44] because that word new is not
[1:34:47] new if you look that word up in your
[1:34:50] strong concordance it's the same word as
[1:34:51] when adam knew his wife eve
[1:34:55] now see that was a sexual relationship
[1:34:57] we're not having that now we're having a
[1:34:59] spiritual
[1:35:00] relationship with jesus christ amen and
[1:35:02] that's what it should have been to start
[1:35:03] with satan
[1:35:04] satan had a knowledge of that and how he
[1:35:07] perverted he turned it natural
[1:35:11] i'll get into the natural people and
[1:35:12] i'll grab me a bunch of people man we'll
[1:35:14] just have a we'll have a bowl let's
[1:35:16] stand to our feet
[1:35:17] god bless you two spirits
[1:35:20] from before the beginning glory but
[1:35:23] guess what
[1:35:25] you were with the eternal before the
[1:35:28] beginning
[1:35:29] if you're born again today if not you
[1:35:33] were
[1:35:33] life and that's all you'll ever be
[1:35:37] satan is life he was given life by god
[1:35:40] but look satan can't give life
[1:35:43] that'd make him a creator he perverts
[1:35:46] the life that god gives us
[1:35:48] and then when christ came and died on
[1:35:50] the cross
[1:35:51] to redeem those what that were lost
[1:35:57] there's your plan of redemption
[1:36:00] he didn't redeem the devil's kids
[1:36:04] he redeemed his own children that
[1:36:06] genesis 1 26
[1:36:08] man can't be bought can't be sold can't
[1:36:11] beat
[1:36:12] it's eternal
[1:36:15] it's a part of god it's not a second
[1:36:18] person
[1:36:20] when that when that form stepped over
[1:36:21] and started creating that wasn't another
[1:36:23] person right
[1:36:24] that was god moving so fast he could
[1:36:26] still be standing right here and be
[1:36:27] standing over there at the same time
[1:36:29] amen oh come on people heaven wasn't
[1:36:32] empty there was god standing there
[1:36:35] there was a father and there was one
[1:36:38] down on the earth because that's what
[1:36:39] satan couldn't understand if thou be
[1:36:43] god's just so much faster than satan is
[1:36:46] he's way
[1:36:47] faster than the devil because he's the
[1:36:50] creator and he's my daddy
[1:36:52] that's what makes us if we yield to him
[1:36:54] it makes us faster than the devil
[1:36:56] we can see his tactics before he even
[1:36:58] brings it to us
[1:37:01] we can smell it a mile away
[1:37:04] don't let it get close to you because
[1:37:06] remember if the trumpet makes an
[1:37:08] uncertain sound don't listen to it
[1:37:13] that's the devil it may be a horn it may
[1:37:16] be in tune
[1:37:18] but it's the wrong signal brother brown
[1:37:22] said
[1:37:22] to be in the wrong ranks at the rapture
[1:37:25] is no excuse
[1:37:28] we know that this is coming to a head
[1:37:30] and it's coming so close till it will
[1:37:32] deceive the very elect if it's possible
[1:37:34] which is not going to but it's going to
[1:37:37] be to where we're going to have to see
[1:37:39] though once we see
[1:37:40] that separation see when you get real
[1:37:43] close
[1:37:44] you can't tell a whole lot i mean it's
[1:37:45] real right here's real close
[1:37:47] but i get you out there a little bit
[1:37:48] further i can see what your tactics are
[1:37:51] don't let the devil get close to you
[1:37:54] resist the devil and heal what
[1:37:56] [Music]
[1:37:57] wow let's sing a song
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:15] captives free sing it oh there's a river
[1:38:18] of life
[1:38:30] [Music]
[1:38:40] [Music]
[1:38:41] thank god we don't have that old life
[1:38:43] anymore
[1:38:44] oh there's a river of fire flowing
[1:38:48] out of me it makes a lame to
[1:38:52] walk in the blind to see
[1:39:01] [Music]
[1:39:09] within my soul
[1:39:12] [Music]
[1:39:14] [Applause]
[1:39:18] [Music]
[1:39:20] and give to me
[1:39:21] [Applause]
[1:39:23] that life abundantly
[1:39:28] see there's a secret the secret
[1:39:31] is is when god sent that little prophet
[1:39:33] william branham on the earth
[1:39:37] did you watch on here what are you
[1:39:38] saying he said lord if you leave me here
[1:39:40] i'll get a million more remember he was
[1:39:43] saying that he said oh these are
[1:39:44] millions of brandons he said no you're
[1:39:46] your converts
[1:39:47] remember when he come out of that quote
[1:39:48] he said lord if you'll let me live long
[1:39:50] enough
[1:39:51] i'll get you a million more well guess
[1:39:52] what he went on
[1:39:54] from this life but there's way more now
[1:39:58] that's born again under his message than
[1:40:00] ever was
[1:40:01] when he saw that across the curtain of
[1:40:02] time amen
[1:40:05] millions more around the world while it
[1:40:07] was a very in its infancy there in the
[1:40:09] 60s
[1:40:11] but now look at it
[1:40:14] so a spiritual multiplication that's
[1:40:16] exactly the way god wanted it
[1:40:19] he wanted it through adam and eve it
[1:40:21] wasn't a perversion but look what satan
[1:40:22] did
[1:40:23] he perverted it dropped us down into
[1:40:25] this other life that we live
[1:40:28] but what god do god sends the word
[1:40:32] and says if you'll believe in me the
[1:40:35] works that i do you shall do also
[1:40:39] and if you'll go to that upper room i'll
[1:40:41] give you the holy ghost
[1:40:43] tarry till i come back and then that was
[1:40:46] 120. now 3 000. now 300 thousand now
[1:40:49] millions of christians
[1:40:51] but think about the ones in the message
[1:40:53] that through that little prophet
[1:40:56] brother brown didn't give us a new way
[1:40:57] to receive eternal life
[1:40:59] no he just gave us clarity
[1:41:02] to what some people already had right
[1:41:06] because the devil were blind he can
[1:41:07] still blind us people he blinds us right
[1:41:09] now
[1:41:11] but remember your life is precious when
[1:41:14] you get eternal life that come from
[1:41:16] way that's satan's problem
[1:41:20] he was created right here
[1:41:24] you weren't created you were right there
[1:41:27] with that guy that come all the way down
[1:41:29] and all of a sudden boom there's
[1:41:31] lucifer and then all over here steps to
[1:41:33] logos
[1:41:35] and satan says ah where'd that come from
[1:41:39] i feel he's got a spirit about him i
[1:41:41] feel the anointing
[1:41:43] but i don't know who that guy is that's
[1:41:46] okay
[1:41:47] if he's inside of me i don't want him to
[1:41:48] know i don't want to know who it is
[1:41:50] if that logos is inside of me satan
[1:41:52] won't know who it is
[1:41:55] that to me is when brother brown
[1:41:57] preached christ is the mystery of god
[1:41:58] reveal now where is christ now
[1:42:00] [Music]
[1:42:02] he's inside of you he's not walking
[1:42:04] around the earth
[1:42:06] satan could feel all that you know if
[1:42:08] you be and you know i see what you're
[1:42:10] doing
[1:42:11] but he can't stand it when he don't know
[1:42:13] about you
[1:42:16] so you pray this week that god will
[1:42:18] reveal to you who you are
[1:42:21] i'm trying to tell you where you came
[1:42:22] from you came from the eternal
[1:42:26] you never had a beginning but yet there
[1:42:28] had to be a beginning of the creation of
[1:42:30] god brother they'll keep covering that
[1:42:32] but that beginning of the creation of
[1:42:34] god made way that you and i could
[1:42:36] have that new life right because without
[1:42:39] jesus christ coming
[1:42:40] it was just life and maybe some
[1:42:42] permitted eternal life in the old
[1:42:44] testament hello
[1:42:46] right but when christ died he released
[1:42:49] that logos
[1:42:52] and he released that logos on the day of
[1:42:54] pentecost and it was 120
[1:42:56] and then as they were preaching under
[1:42:58] spiritual multiplication 3 000 come to
[1:43:00] be
[1:43:01] then 3 million and every how many
[1:43:03] million that's going to populate that
[1:43:04] world
[1:43:05] came out of josh was showing me a thing
[1:43:08] and
[1:43:08] i got it on my phone where it was
[1:43:12] you got here by two people right mother
[1:43:14] and the father
[1:43:16] if you go back 400 they you go back 400
[1:43:21] years
[1:43:22] right josh it took four thousand and
[1:43:25] twenty-something people
[1:43:28] how much four thousand and ninety-four
[1:43:31] people
[1:43:32] had to get together to get you here
[1:43:37] wow because you got to go back to
[1:43:42] your parents parents they split off
[1:43:45] but you've got your mama's parents
[1:43:46] parents and then your grandparents your
[1:43:48] great grand great great grand i think
[1:43:50] that went the ninth the grand prix
[1:43:52] ninth generation up but it took four
[1:43:55] thousand people
[1:43:56] to get you here brother brown said god
[1:43:59] what
[1:43:59] he bred this one to this one this one to
[1:44:02] this one
[1:44:02] and this one do this one to get you here
[1:44:05] but you know that's really not anything
[1:44:06] that's man doing that god was standing
[1:44:08] there talking to lucifer and he already
[1:44:10] knew we were
[1:44:10] where we were coming from and where we
[1:44:12] were going
[1:44:14] it wasn't nothing new to him right i
[1:44:16] think maybe he tried to talk to lucifer
[1:44:18] and explain some things to him elusive
[1:44:20] were like
[1:44:21] i don't know i don't get that because
[1:44:24] you know what he hates revelation
[1:44:26] right i read you the quote brother brown
[1:44:27] said satan hates revelation he hates
[1:44:29] when somebody knows something he don't
[1:44:30] know
[1:44:32] he don't know jesus christ like me and
[1:44:34] you do glory and that makes him so mad
[1:44:37] and that's okay because remember he
[1:44:38] can't touch you until god's through with
[1:44:41] him
[1:44:42] he cannot touch you until god's through
[1:44:43] with you if the footstep
[1:44:45] of the righteous or order the lord and
[1:44:47] you're the footsteps of the righteous
[1:44:50] no way yeah no way
[1:44:53] i was reading where brother brown was
[1:44:54] talking about airplanes
[1:44:57] he almost died about four times in
[1:44:58] airplanes if you didn't know that
[1:45:00] one of them almost they said uh in an
[1:45:03] interview with billy paul he said one of
[1:45:04] them you could see the
[1:45:05] water he was going overseas he's you
[1:45:07] could literally see the waves
[1:45:09] before the plane turned back up one time
[1:45:11] ago them
[1:45:12] them guardian angels was pushing the
[1:45:14] bottom of that airplane
[1:45:16] you don't believe that i do i believe
[1:45:19] they thumped us on out of the way so
[1:45:20] that guy could right
[1:45:22] you know drive right in between us and
[1:45:23] not harm probably 20 people or more
[1:45:26] in those vans we would have had a wreck
[1:45:28] you wouldn't believe what a wreck we'd
[1:45:29] have had
[1:45:30] but you know what there were some
[1:45:31] born-again believers in that trail
[1:45:33] in that van and you know what they
[1:45:35] needed to keep on going
[1:45:37] they needed to keep on their journey so
[1:45:39] you just thank god
[1:45:40] that you every day you get up in the
[1:45:42] morning i just think yeah
[1:45:45] thank you for everything thank you for
[1:45:47] everything you've given me i got another
[1:45:48] day to breathe
[1:45:51] he said well i get older enough it foots
[1:45:54] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:45:56] of the lord you don't worry about all
[1:45:58] them other peripheral things
[1:46:00] okay don't worry that you can't get out
[1:46:02] of chair like you used to
[1:46:04] or you can't do things like you used to
[1:46:06] do you're here for a purpose
[1:46:08] and there's a place to fulfill that
[1:46:10] purpose and you're standing in it right
[1:46:12] now you just got to believe that
[1:46:14] and you know what but you know why are
[1:46:16] you saying that by the way because when
[1:46:17] remember brother brown says when we
[1:46:18] realize
[1:46:19] who she is bride and what she's doing
[1:46:22] here
[1:46:22] she'll be an invincible army invincible
[1:46:25] listen
[1:46:26] we lose a lot of human battles we lose a
[1:46:28] lot of spiritual battles
[1:46:31] i don't know about you but i do i lose a
[1:46:33] lot of spiritual battles
[1:46:35] but when he said she'll be an invincible
[1:46:37] army what is invincible
[1:46:39] you cannot be beat
[1:46:42] she'll be an invincible army that's when
[1:46:44] death is going to walk up and we're
[1:46:45] going to go
[1:46:46] no not today not today
[1:46:49] no death no we know what you are
[1:46:52] we know where you come from and we don't
[1:46:55] want to have no part of it
[1:46:57] you love the lord god bless you let's
[1:46:59] bow our hands
[1:47:01] lord if anybody's sick among us we pray
[1:47:04] that you heal them now
[1:47:06] we pray that you bless the ones that are
[1:47:08] watching in lord that you'll take care
[1:47:10] of them lord and heal them father
[1:47:12] don't it doesn't have to be a natural
[1:47:13] healing lord it needs maybe a spiritual
[1:47:16] healing lord we
[1:47:17] people saying in the congregation or
[1:47:18] different places lord they need you
[1:47:20] father in their life
[1:47:22] they don't need somebody to tell them
[1:47:26] lord they know i know i need you in my
[1:47:28] life more
[1:47:30] each one of us do and father we pray
[1:47:32] that you would anoint us lord for this
[1:47:34] journey that we're taking
[1:47:36] and that we'll see the two spirits in
[1:47:38] the framework of the church and we'll be
[1:47:39] able to discern
[1:47:42] and to distinguish the tactics of the
[1:47:44] devil because
[1:47:45] many lord 99 of the people in this world
[1:47:47] are going to be
[1:47:48] deceived by satan father we know that'll
[1:47:52] happen
[1:47:53] but we know as i said before
[1:47:56] we've been protected we are the children
[1:47:59] of almighty god
[1:48:00] and we have a purpose and you had a plan
[1:48:03] and a purpose that we were
[1:48:04] totally included in it and we'll see
[1:48:07] this thing ended up lord in a body
[1:48:08] change when we'll
[1:48:09] just death will be destroyed and we'll
[1:48:12] take a rapture lord and go be with the
[1:48:14] ones that's waiting
[1:48:15] in that dimension lord this in that
[1:48:17] perfect love
[1:48:19] that's waiting on us lord to finish what
[1:48:22] we're supposed to finish
[1:48:23] and then lord will be taken out of here
[1:48:25] and then satan will just come down on
[1:48:27] this earth and
[1:48:28] and incarnate a pope and and
[1:48:31] all hell will break loose but lord it
[1:48:33] won't be for the bride
[1:48:35] father we've already been judged i want
[1:48:37] people to realize that lord that you'll
[1:48:38] give them comfort it doesn't matter
[1:48:40] if we're born again christians today let
[1:48:43] it sound around the world that we are
[1:48:46] the redeemed and we are the sinless
[1:48:50] spotless bride of jesus christ and we
[1:48:54] will not have to stand in
[1:48:55] any judgment lord you even told us we
[1:48:58] judge the world
[1:48:59] we'll judge the saints we'll judge the
[1:49:01] angels what
[1:49:03] lord because it's you you're the perfect
[1:49:06] judge
[1:49:07] and us being a part of that perfect
[1:49:09] judge lord it makes us
[1:49:11] unjudgeable in our soul father
[1:49:14] there's little things we have to get rid
[1:49:15] of on the earth we know that lord
[1:49:17] we're not saying we're sinless
[1:49:19] perfection but you know what we're
[1:49:20] talking about lord
[1:49:21] we don't have to be judged for the sins
[1:49:23] that we do we ask forgiveness for them
[1:49:26] and lord you are just to forgive us but
[1:49:29] not down in our soul
[1:49:30] we're just as eternal as you are lord
[1:49:32] and what a
[1:49:33] what a sound confirmation that is that
[1:49:36] we can lay our head down at night
[1:49:39] and say god i'll see in the morning
[1:49:43] this whole body's got to rest for a few
[1:49:45] hours rejuvenate
[1:49:48] but lord we long for that time where we
[1:49:51] don't have to sleep anymore
[1:49:54] well we can be in the
[1:49:57] joy of our youth and
[1:50:00] oh just to think about it lord yes that
[1:50:04] we'll enjoy
[1:50:05] an eternity with you
[1:50:09] and all your children all of us have
[1:50:10] like precious faith from all the
[1:50:12] generations from the
[1:50:14] ones lord that were fed to lions from
[1:50:16] the ones lord like paul that had his
[1:50:18] head chopped off and all the different
[1:50:20] ones
[1:50:21] we'll be able to sit around the table
[1:50:23] with him
[1:50:24] or walked down by the river and sat and
[1:50:26] talked to him for a million years
[1:50:28] what a wonderful time lord but thank you
[1:50:30] for giving us this earthly journey lord
[1:50:32] because without this earthly journey
[1:50:33] there'd be no redemption
[1:50:35] because you redeemed a group of people
[1:50:37] right out of satan's eden
[1:50:38] and we thank you for that lord father
[1:50:40] give us straight be with our pastor as
[1:50:42] he travels this week
[1:50:43] and us next weekend lord as we go to

[1:50:52] them comfort as you only can
[1:50:54] and we ask just be with each one father
