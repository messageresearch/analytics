[0:01] morning
[0:06] brother there's some stories in the
[0:08] Bible you can just kind of identify with
[0:10] and Abel's story is one that just really
[0:14] stands out to me so I wanted to look at
[0:18] just part of the story and the part we
[0:21] want to look at is able sacrifice how he
[0:23] how he approached
[0:24] God and
[0:26] um so let's go ahead and and Adam knew
[0:30] Eve his wife and she conceited and bear
[0:33] can and said I have gotten a man from
[0:35] the Lord and she again beared brother
[0:38] Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep but
[0:40] Cain was a tiller on the
[0:42] ground and in process of time it came to
[0:44] pass that Cain brought of the fruit of
[0:46] the ground and offering unto the Lord
[0:48] and Abel he also brought of the
[0:50] firstlings of his flock and of the fat
[0:51] thereof and the Lord had respect unto
[0:54] Abel unto his offering but unto Cain
[0:56] unto his offering he had not respect and
[0:59] Cain was is very raw and his countless
[1:02] fa so if you look at what other people
[1:06] have said down commentaries of this of
[1:08] these scriptures there's always been two
[1:10] questions why was able sacrifice
[1:12] accepted and how was it accepted and so
[1:16] let's start off by reading through what
[1:18] brother said about it we know that first
[1:20] of all Abel came to God by faith he
[1:24] received a revelation from
[1:26] God um so let's let's set up the set up
[1:31] the story about thinking about what was
[1:34] going on
[1:37] um uh in Revelations 4 part three B said
[1:42] and these Cher there's four Cher
[1:44] standing at the East Gate of Ed and um
[1:48] they were placed there to drive us away
[1:50] to drive them away from the Tree of Life
[1:55] and
[1:55] now they're drawing us back was for the
[1:59] same for CH the lon man ox and Eagle
[2:04] brother said and these CH first
[2:06] mentioned was place at the East Gate of
[2:07] the Guard going four ways I should have
[2:10] made that a little different from that I
[2:12] can't adjust it to God's orders and
[2:13] things like that but I just so that
[2:15] you'll know what I mean there's the
[2:16] Garden of Eden and this is the gate
[2:18] right here opens up here swings out at
[2:20] this gate there was Cher Cher and
[2:23] remember it doesn't say a cherub it said
[2:25] cherubim cherabin was placed there to
[2:28] guard what the Tree of Life that's what
[2:30] they was to guard the way of the tree of
[2:32] life the way who is the way Jesus where
[2:35] is it reflected from here is the holy
[2:38] place here are the CH now watch put all
[2:40] this down here's the holy Hol this
[2:43] holiest of holies holy of holies this is
[2:45] the holy place and he starts going
[2:47] through the Tabernacle how the
[2:49] Tabernacle speaks of our our journey
[2:51] through salvation from justification
[2:54] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[2:55] Ghost and then he talks about
[2:58] um so that shows that God's altar was
[3:02] moved and set here at the Garden of Eden
[3:03] and the only way back to Eden is by the
[3:05] altar here you are again see Back to
[3:08] Eden through the Altar and they were to
[3:09] keep that way there guarded that they
[3:11] couldn't get back there until this altar
[3:13] was covered by
[3:15] Blood
[3:22] so now in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[3:25] brother R said it was a revelation from
[3:27] God that made the difference gave you
[3:30] able eternal
[3:31] life and think about your own Journey
[3:34] how you received your Revelation I
[3:36] remember when I I received a revelation
[3:38] of uh one day my dad was I went on a
[3:42] walk well I let me back up I was raised
[3:44] in the message and for years I didn't
[3:46] really um I heard about all of these
[3:49] things for years and years then one day
[3:51] I took a walk but my dad he started
[3:54] talking about the future home and at
[3:56] that moment it just became it just
[3:57] opened up and I saw what the problem was
[4:01] what the solution was and what I need to
[4:04] do to accept
[4:06] Jesus so that's that's kind of the same
[4:08] Journey that able went
[4:11] through but look in the maniac of gadara
[4:15] in 1954 but look coming here at Abel not
[4:17] was working wraps a little Vine around
[4:19] this whole sheep's neck and here he come
[4:21] pulling him up there throwing him upon
[4:23] the alter and began to beat his throat
[4:25] and killed him why able had a revelation
[4:27] we're letting that took just a minut it
[4:29] was Revelation that Abel had that made
[4:31] him just he had a revelation of the
[4:33] requirement of almighty God and he
[4:34] brought a lamb and that's the only way
[4:36] that he'll ever be able to see Divine
[4:37] Healing the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[4:39] will be by
[4:42] Revelation and um the power of God
[4:46] 1955 he offered unto God a more
[4:49] excellent sacrifice than that of King
[4:51] God testifying that
[4:53] it he was righteous because he seen the
[4:56] program of God which was revealed to him
[4:59] now they had and the Bible wasn't
[5:00] written then so it came his brother who
[5:03] said under the same teaching my father
[5:05] and mother came down and brought fruit
[5:06] to make the offering but ail by
[5:08] Revelation he saw that it wasn't fruits
[5:10] that brought us out of the Garden of
[5:11] Eden and some people still think it was
[5:14] but it wasn't fruits it was the blood of
[5:16] his mother who made Mortal over his
[5:17] father so he came and offered the blood
[5:19] of the Lamb by divine revelation no one
[5:22] to tell him anything about it but he by
[5:24] faith he seen the Son of God coming off
[5:26] and offered the lamb and figured the
[5:28] type seeing that Jesus was the Lamb
[5:29] slain before the foundation of the world
[5:32] so Abel didn't just get a revelation to
[5:35] just bring a lamb he saw what the
[5:37] problem was and he saw what the solution
[5:38] was he saw and figured looking ahead to
[5:42] the Son of God coming and he saw he got
[5:45] a revelation of the mate that his
[5:47] parents
[5:53] have now here's here's God's plan the
[5:57] word was from the beginning God's plan
[5:59] CL I'm sorry this is the God of this
[6:01] evil age
[6:03] 1965 but God revealed by Revelation the
[6:06] very thing that he Vindicated and
[6:08] punctuated that that was right not
[6:10] religion not an altar not belonging to
[6:12] church not making a sacrifice not being
[6:14] cons sincere but by the revelation of
[6:17] the word of
[6:19] God that's that's the starting point he
[6:22] getting Revelation from God you can
[6:24] continue on that then the next thing is
[6:28] he got a revelation that he needed to
[6:31] bring a lamb to the offer that God had
[6:34] put at the East Gate so that's what he
[6:37] did
[6:39] now what if what if he had not done that
[6:42] what if he said okay I know what to do
[6:44] but I'm just going to do what I what I
[6:47] you know what I want to do like Kan then
[6:51] God would have never accepted anything
[6:52] he would have never accepted
[6:55] it so that's the next
[6:57] phase is obedience to his
[7:04] word and show us the father and seis
[7:08] 1950 they didn't have any ropes in them
[7:10] days I guess so they had a Vine maybe
[7:12] wrapped around his neck because it was
[7:14] it was Christ that's who it was but they
[7:16] L him away like a lamb to the slaughter
[7:18] they put a rope around his neck and here
[7:20] he come leading this little lamb
[7:21] bleeding pulling back he laid him upon a
[7:23] rock perhaps didn't have have any sharp
[7:26] knives in them days probably took an old
[7:28] sharp Rock and held his little head back
[7:30] and begin to beat his little throat bble
[7:32] did see and the blood be to Spur out of
[7:34] his little arteries in his neck did you
[7:36] ever hear a lamb dying most pathetic
[7:38] thing you ever heard is to hear lamb die
[7:40] how it bleeds and
[7:42] bleeds and when you start to obey God
[7:45] then you become separated from the world
[7:48] you know can you imagine what Cain
[7:50] probably thought looking at watching
[7:51] Abel bring that lamb down and say what
[7:53] are you going to do with that and
[7:54] started hacking on it with a with a rock
[7:57] that that's the same same thing the
[7:59] world looks at us today and sees our our
[8:02] sisters going through the mall or
[8:03] wherever long dresses and long hair they
[8:06] always think something think we're
[8:10] strange obedience bring
[8:19] separation uh an uncertain sound 19
[8:22] 61 he's got to hear the sound of death
[8:26] bless God what God wants today is you to
[8:28] die die of the things of the world and
[8:30] yourself here scream Lord take me as I
[8:33] am that's what God wants he wants that
[8:35] sound of death that death rattle of an
[8:36] old man Adam is dying that he might come
[8:38] in and take his place and Rule you and
[8:40] be your
[8:43] lord and I will restore an 19ah 54
[8:46] remember Abel died on the altar with his
[8:48] lamb and every man that comes to Christ
[8:50] must die on the same altar Jesus Christ
[8:52] did on the altar of self sacrifice
[8:54] forgetting your own ways forgetting your
[8:55] own reasons and taking God's word and
[8:57] saying it's your word Lord Lord I
[8:59] believe it and their dies able did on
[9:01] the rock with his same lamb died with
[9:03] that died for him ready we die out for
[9:05] Christ on the offers of God
[9:10] sacrifice and moving on after you've
[9:13] obeyed God then we've all read this
[9:16] quote in the token full obedience to the
[9:19] full word of God entitles us to the
[9:20] Token no other way is there that you
[9:23] could ever be entitled to the Token
[9:24] until you fully obey the word not what
[9:27] somebody has put into it and added to it
[9:29] what God said about
[9:35] it and then uh Revelation 4 part three
[9:39] he just lays it out justification by
[9:41] here sanctification is what you do in
[9:44] regards to what you did and appreci an
[9:45] appreciation of that God still you by
[9:47] the Holy
[9:49] Ghost and let me so he's he's believed
[9:52] God he's obeyed God and he separated
[9:54] from the things of the world and the
[9:56] next thing is it's to wait
[10:00] because in Luke 24 Jesus told him behold
[10:06] I send the promis of my father upon you
[10:07] but tear you in the city of Jerusalem
[10:09] until you be undu with power from on
[10:11] high if you've done everything you know
[10:13] to do to just stand back and wait and
[10:16] this same formula applies to Healing to
[10:19] adoption to everything believe God and
[10:22] wait on
[10:23] it and I I like this story in Exodus
[10:26] when
[10:28] uh and Aaron went to pharaoh and they
[10:32] Aaron threw down his
[10:34] rod and they turned into a serpent and
[10:36] then Here Come The Magicians and they
[10:38] throw down their rods too he had
[10:40] believed God he obeyed it now he just
[10:43] waited right the serpent came and ha up
[10:46] the other two but if you just wait on
[10:48] God and God will do the
[10:54] rest in the message presuming brother
[10:56] around said they waited until the
[10:58] scripture was made made manifest to them
[10:59] they didn't presume nothing they waited
[11:01] till it was over they waited till they
[11:03] got it so now God's going to come and
[11:07] accept able
[11:09] sacrifice and this has been there's only
[11:12] one place brother R said how he accepted
[11:15] able sacrifice and I'm fixing to go
[11:17] through the scripture this in the
[11:19] message presuming
[11:21] 1962 How did Kain when he made an altar
[11:24] just as prety prettier than able he
[11:26] offered fruits he give his tith brought
[11:29] his income into the house of the Lord he
[11:31] knelt on the altar he B bowed him
[11:34] himself he prayed he worshiped just as
[11:36] sincere as any man but God Vindicated
[11:39] ail by consuming his
[11:43] sacrifice so let's get our Bibles out
[11:48] Leviticus
[11:57] 923
[12:00] and we'll see how all the way through
[12:02] the Bible God always accepts the
[12:05] sacrifice the same
[12:13] way chapter 9 verse
[12:17] 23 this is after he had given Moses a
[12:22] commandment of how to set up the
[12:24] Tabernacle and the
[12:26] offerings and he had done all that the
[12:29] Lord
[12:34] commanded and Moses and Aaron went into
[12:36] the Tabernacle of the congregation and
[12:38] came out and blessed the people and the
[12:39] glory of the Lord appeared unto all the
[12:41] people and there came a fire out from
[12:43] before the Lord and consumed upon the
[12:44] offer the burnt offering in the F which
[12:46] when all the people saw they shouted and
[12:48] fell on their
[12:49] faces and now let's turn to judges
[12:57] 6:19
[13:01] and this is Gideon
[13:15] sacrifice and Gideon went in and made
[13:18] ready a kid and unle cakes of an e flow
[13:21] the flesh he put in a basket and he put
[13:23] the broth in a pot and brought it out
[13:25] unto him under the Oak and presented it
[13:27] and the angel of God God said unto him
[13:29] take the Flesh and the UN living CES and
[13:31] laid him Upon This Rock and pour out the
[13:32] broth and he did so then the angel of
[13:35] the Lord put forth the end of the staff
[13:36] that was in his hand and touched the
[13:37] Flesh and the UNL cakes and There Rose
[13:39] up fire out of the Rock and consume the
[13:41] Flesh and the UNL cakes then the angel
[13:43] of the Lord departed out of his
[13:45] side now let's go to First Kings
[13:51] 18 verse
[13:53] 22
[13:57] 2
[14:00] 1 Kings 18 this is Elijah's
[14:04] sacrifice and I think everybody already
[14:06] knows what happens
[14:09] here let's let's go ahead and jump to
[14:11] verse uh
[14:14] 37 First Kings
[14:18] 18:37 hear me oh Lord hear me that this
[14:20] people may know that thou art the Lord
[14:22] God and that thou has turned their part
[14:24] back again then the fire of the Lord
[14:26] fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice in
[14:28] the wood and the stones and the dust and
[14:30] licked up the water that was in the
[14:33] trench goes on now let's go to Second
[14:36] Chronicles chapter
[14:46] 7 and this is Solomon sacrifice after
[14:49] the new Temple was Solomon's Temple was
[14:51] built he went to offer a
[14:54] sacrifice see how that sacrifice was
[14:57] accepted
[14:59] 7 verse1 now when Solomon had made an
[15:01] end of praying the fire came down from
[15:03] heaven and consumed the burnt offering
[15:05] and the sacrifices and the glory of the
[15:07] Lord fill the
[15:12] house I
[15:27] got
[15:34] all right well I had the scripture
[15:36] written now where
[15:38] uh in Matthew it says uh he send the
[15:42] Holy Ghost to fire John John the Baptist
[15:44] speaking and he said I'll send
[15:48] uh One Cometh that will baptize you with
[15:51] the Holy Ghost in fire so on in Acts
[15:54] 2238 they were baptized with the Holy
[15:57] Ghost in fire as just goes all through
[15:59] the Bible and then remember papell just
[16:01] been preaching on the future home how
[16:05] the Earth has to go through the same
[16:06] thing cleansing by water uh blood and
[16:09] fire so it runs all the way through the
[16:13] bottom in that
[16:20] one so real quick before we have
[16:24] get just more
[16:27] things
[16:33] consuming I got
[16:39] many our souls are placed by this is
[16:41] must be born again 1961 our soul rep
[16:44] placed by faith on the brass offered
[16:45] God's judgment and our offering is
[16:48] consumed but if that offering has been
[16:50] received by God is consumed the world is
[16:53] dead to you you're gone but we reckon
[16:54] ourselves dead and buried we are dead
[16:56] and our we are hidden Christ hiding
[16:58] Christ and besides that then and after
[17:00] that we're dead and buried in Hidden
[17:02] Christ and were're sealed with the Holy
[17:05] Spirit the brass altar uh presuming 1962
[17:09] the brass altar consumed the sacrifice
[17:12] that the sacrifice laid upon the alt
[17:14] that was not consuming God refused it
[17:16] see it's consuming and you are God's
[17:18] sacrifice laid yourself upon the offer
[17:20] said God just take it all out of me
[17:22] empty up so you can fill me up you
[17:24] that's right don't presume it believe it
[17:26] yes sir if you don't believe it you God
[17:29] won't receive your
[17:33] sacrifice 1959 watching his star may I
[17:37] say tonight that God has a sign today
[17:39] it's a sign of his spirit that where
[17:41] Jesus is there's life where he is life
[17:43] where Jesus is there's Gospel Life for
[17:45] he is a life where Jesus is there is
[17:47] fire for he is a consuming fire that
[17:49] burns up all your unbelief and
[17:57] draws 64
