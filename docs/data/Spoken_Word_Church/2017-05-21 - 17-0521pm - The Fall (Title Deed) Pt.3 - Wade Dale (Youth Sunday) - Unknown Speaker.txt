even been gas less she go Richard Easter start smiling would you absolutely that's literally good to be in the houses Lord everybody Josh what we're doing here something something still on okay all right we're gonna be in the house or Lord wait a minute little Belarus here to take you didn't shake your hand you've been get mad all service old service and be mad Kalani Ju Ange yeah Dave so I could say that hey man good to be here today good have a picture with us and made Lord bless each and every one of you we're going to continue our thought on the fall in the book of Genesis so if you would but we're going to take a kind of a strange first scripture today and it comes from the book of Malachi because today we're going to come on the angle of we're still in the fall but we're going to look at the title deed because that what we were but we were speaking the last couple of services we understood that that there was a lot of things that Adam had full control of in the garden right and then there was something that he lost in the garden during the fall so we'll back up a little bit but let's read the scripture in Malachi 3 verse 16 I know we're all doing well today and feeling good and everybody bring their spinners with them no okay I told them I - what we may do is we may just give everybody a little a little vial of nitroglycerin and you got to hold that because if you drop it fall asleep you drop it we all will be gone it'll be the last day here so so that way brother dent we got depend on everybody else to hold on to their vows so but we'll just pray that that sleepest period to get out of here a man Malachi 3 verse 16 3 16 and then we'll begin there let's bow our heads dear Lord Jesus we pray today Lord that we know you're here you were hearing the song service the prayer taking up at the offering and all the many things but now we come to a time where it takes a five fold ministry to break it down to the people today Lord we we pray that you would use that gift to give it to the people not so much myself but give it to each one Lord is sitting here today that you would break revelation Lord because that's what we desire is as the pastor we're talking this morning about a headstone in a cornerstone we know stone means revelation because that's something once we get a revelation my Satan can't stand on that Satan cannot have anything to do with that stone of that rock so we pray Lord that you'd bring us revelation today more than anything protect their Lord by your word forgive us of our sins may our thoughts be clearer and I mind be clearer Lord and our voice speak nothing but what you have to say for the people probably just bless the ones that are not here be with the ones that are on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor father we pray Lord that you would take care of the ones that are sick the ones that are on the highway brother Joseph and them all today Lord with with brother Collins we pray that you just be with them Lord and take care of them on the way back let's each one take care of us and lead us into this service in Jesus name we pray we give it all to You Father amen book of Malachi 3 verse 16 says then they that feared the Lord now look spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened or in other words the Lord responded to that you know Bob was speaking this morning about the sons of God shouting for joy well the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord not everybody but for him that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name so a book of remembrance was written so let's be seated the Lord added blessing to the reading of the word so we see that we we know one thing's for sure that before the foundation of the world by foreknowledge God knowing all things right that he would absolutely be able to write a book of names and what was going to happen while they were here before there was ever a Genesis 1:26 development that we've been talking about amen that all right because predestination is not stamped it's not predetermined as far as this is exactly what you're going to do but by foreknowledge God could look and see what we decided to do and what he is going to do because his purpose his purpose is going to be carried out he's God and he changes not but we change but even the unchanging God could be able to write names and not have to change the names in this book I'm talking about the one I'm talking about is the Genesis 1:26 book that all right because remember there's books there's books and there's books inside a book Judas's name was in a book Jesus's name was in the book of life but Jesus his name was never in the eternal section and then that Genesis 1:26 where God created man in his own image we've been through that to past couple of services how that God so preserved that group of people that that was him made manifest in another form that was a group of people that is a special group of people that group of people did not include Moses Isaiah Elijah Malachi not belittling them but there's his 1:26 men was the soul of Almighty God and that soul of Almighty God developed are formed into another not another person but another attribute of God came out of him which was his sons and his daughters amen because when Adam came on New York and Adam was put in flesh and then Eve was taken out of Adam when we read in just a minute when Eve was taken out of Adam they were put here not to just be two people on the earth they were here to multiply I thought we read that Genesis 1:26 the prophet of God said they were even called the multiplying replace your not in human bodies amen you said well how in the world see we've got all that sexual thing in our mind that it has to be an act between a man and a woman why because we're on this side of the fall and that's how it's got to come okay now listen nothing wrong with that if it's done in the right way but it wasn't God's original plan amen we weren't to come here this way this is actually this is was not this was just permitted by God to get you here because of what happened in the fall and we'll talk about that since we'll have a few litter that are new among us we'll kind of maybe ease into that summon and I wasn't going to but I guess well now so in Genesis 2 verse 7 that we already took to Genesis 1:26 man and we showed how that that was that was like the Holy Ghost brooding over the earth but remember the Lord God formed man in Genesis 2:7 if you'll pull that up the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul now before that I said there was no man there to kill us all all right there was no man there that I look at it this way whether it's right or not God knew he was going to have children he knew one Adam and Eve would look like but yet the prophet of God said he was lonely until he brought something out that he could see because look you can have fellowship but you can't have fellowship good writely fellowship unless they somebody standing right here amen that's two fellows in the same ship that's what fellowship is and then so God had to being a father being having those attributes he had to produce something that he could see and I clean it and Purdue he wanted it that's what he wanted to do he wanted to be able to talk about him he wanted to be able to talk to somebody named Eve and man he wanted to speak to them he didn't want to just have fellowship what in the mind sure in the mind of God everything was already finished everything was already done he knew who all his children were who knew who was going to turn him down he knew who was going to be here on the earth and he knew the very day that the earth was going to end and the very day we walk into the future home but God wasn't satisfied with that if he was satisfied with that he would have stayed that way right here on the front row today good job alright so now you got to make sure I don't point up anymore make sure the point sideways okay because look God's not up here heavens not up here that's what we've been taught all of our life that heaven was somewhere to go and God was up here and it's okay to look up and pray but I thought Moses said he was in you naívi even in my heart the word of faith that we preach so we got to try to quit pointing where we're going up to something because like brother Dale said you know for years and years man has tried to prove it heavens way up here and God's Way up here and for all that times God's going no I'm I never left I'm right here with you you know the whole time so here we go in Genesis 2:7 the Lord God formed the man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life now we know being recipients and I believe that's being recipients of the prophets message we can clearly see what happened in the Garden of Eden clearly see by the steps that God took he breathed the breath of life into Adam and he became a living soul because we're going to read this alright he put that Genesis 1:26 man into Adam that all right amen and then he became a living soul watch now look questions and answers number 1 now we're going to back up a little bit brother Anderson asked me he said he said I hope you're going to go back and back up a little bit from last Sunday which I am going to bring a few quotes from last Sunday to maybe help us out now the prophet of God said that now if a man was made something like that little sacred light yonder or something like that it could not be seen which is a spiritual being now what's he talking about he's talking about God unfolding itself from this great being that no one can understand how can you understand a God that knew you would be here what every thought you would have not the 7 billion people that's on the earth but me just if he can you ever thought I'd have from a day I was born till the day I take a rapture just me plus all the other billions okay how you done understanding me somebody like that hey you understand somebody that's standing in eternity never had the beginning never had an end never was one second older than when we go back in says wouldn't God created the heavens and the earth and we know that there you know could be millions years old so we can't understand him but you know what the only way we can understand him is the way he gave us the way he gave us was the Bible the prophets fivefold ministry he gave us these things to help us understand him and actually came down here in human flesh himself to help us understand really how how to see this God because you know what he had after abuse at Genesis 1:26 is a total attribute of God now sure Moses and Elijah and all them I don't want to get you off on that because it's a whole sermon but but they're not sons and daughters of God like we are they were not born again in their soul while they were here on the earth they were what they were here anointed by God because the property God said one time he said David would not have had his best friend killed and committed adultery with a woman if he hadn't had the whole goat now he had an anointing where he could speak in the first person that pierced my hands and my feet as they did all they say sure the anointing fell you got to remember because when John the Baptist had seen that anointing many times fall on to Caiaphas following different priests but the angel of God said join whoever you see that the Spirit of God descend and remain amen the Spirit of God would go on Moses and it would go on and so much and it would be so much of his face with shine but when he stepped back the prophet of God said he was Moses and he was a murderer a man killed an Egyptian and man you can't get the Holy Ghost to do that all right but they were covered under the blood of bulls and goats which only covered sin it didn't eradicate sin until Christ died on the cross they didn't have a chance that's why they had to be in Paradise that's why there had to be a place called Paradise because look those Genesis 1:26 that's the children of God that's God soul and that's all inside of you that's God soul that's why you can go into that sixth dimension under the altar close to God and then because you're his children Abraham was never called the child of God he was called a friend of God yet Abraham as the father of our faith not belittling them one bit but they were not included in this part that we're talking about that all right all right here we go pull the question answers on Genesis back up now if a man was made something like that a little sacred light yonder or something like that it could not be seen which is a supernatural being he manifested are unfolding himself a little more to make a trinity of himself which we don't believe in a Trinity we know it's a triune of T of God there's not a separate father a separate son in a separate Holy Ghost somewhere it's one person a man and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ and here was God unfolding himself now down into let us make man which was his son and offspring from him man in our own image he was a supernatural being and let him have dominion over the cattle of the field and so forth now the man led to now the man led the man led the cattle and everything just like the Holy Spirit leads a real true believers a the voice of God out there now watch he changed that he really says he stopped he said the voice of man rather would speak and say and call the cattle and the sheep and all them in other words you know bade what Adam said all right everything obeyed him now but when there was no man to till the soil Genesis to no man who killed us all and then God formed man out of the dust in the earth now listen let's stop there second because let me go back my point guard using item was who Adam would look what Adam would look like yet Adam was an attribute of his but he was not expressed yet God wanted that to be expressed so he formed Adam now why wouldn't that go act to thee to the animal world same thing the animals were ruled by a supernatural being but not in it I don't think that they could see Adam in the way that God wanted him to see why would he put him down there why would he put him in a human body I don't mean got us don't have to peel the soul he can move it with his mind but he put him down there so the animals can say look that's our leader that's our that's the man that's the one that's leading us because when man fell that's what the animals did they look to us and said why did you fall because remember the animal kingdom never fell and then you and I are the highest form of animal there is if when we fell we took everything with us and then I'll show it to you in just a minute now but there was no man to kill us all so what was God doing God was allowing Adam to be seen by what the animal kingdom and then also he had to have what I helped me man we're looking just saying it was no man to till the soil then God formed man Genesis 2:7 out of the dust of the earth now we follow it he formed man out of the dust of the earth and put this supernatural spirit so he takes that Genesis 1:26 man and he puts it in the 2:7 man that all right hey man I'm gonna scare some Libyan man could you sleep him now he was laying there I don't believe y'all done fell asleep and it's only been 15 minutes this for you people we have a ball game on it wouldn't be yeah get your spinners out the thing fight it you're not fighting it you're wanting to sleep that's the problem get down get all comfortable maybe get a pincushion we could all sit on the pinkish y'all might shout and say how low you might run around the building to get set on a pincushion okay now he was laying there and I can have many pictures of it I can see Adam standing let's take this waste see him standing like a tree God didn't made him he was dead as he could be his toes like the roots sticking out of the ground so what was God doing listen this is this is this is nothing more than than than the elements of the earth and then your body is made up of every element that's in this earth potassium calcium phosphorus all those things your body actually comes straight out of the earth you say no I'm came from mom and daddy mom and daddy had to eat the beans mom and daddy had to eat the potatoes amen we came from this earth there's nothing new Under the Sun your body came right out of this earth and it was in the Garden of Eden we were talking the other day about all this other stuff your body was there too hey man property God said when Jesus laid claim on the arts at Calvary when he shed his blood he said your body it was in this earth that's your identification that's what we got local sentiment and God said let there be or breathed the breath of life into him and he junk came to himself see was breathed the breath of life into him he became a living soul now and he began to move on move on so God takes this Genesis 1:26 and we were talking about it last Sunday he takes that 1:26 man puts in the 2:7 man he has the masculine and feminine Spirit inside of him it's alright man because we look in Genesis 2 verse 21 now before that God looks and he said okay everything's good I've got I've got a mom account at daddy count and mom a horse and a daddy horse and I got two of each and then but I've only got one item and in other words in other words to fully develop this picture I've got to do something else and then because I was telling them backstage back there in the back have you ever looked up the word woman you ever looked up the word woman okay let's read this in RT was it and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof God is a master physician amen he's an anesthesiologist he's a master surgeon and I don't believe he left the scar when he closed the wound by God all right because he's the creator and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman now look at that word woman that's a lowercase W and brought her under him and I don't said this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh she shall be called capital letter WOM a.m. but you know what the word woman means a man with a womb right a man why do you think a woman is called a female she's a feminine male because remember God's a male everything had to come from God but to reproduce to reproduce Adam he had to have a helpmeet or a man with a womb think about it exactly what the female part of a man is called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and mother that doesn't say you leave your wife and cleave to you father mother we got it backwards this day in time no most people are leaving their spouse and going back home with a mom and daddy it says leave your mama leave your daddy and cleave unto your wife and they shall be one flesh all right now look you say Oh what is what Adam could never reproduce himself without that woman hey man there's no way it's powerful as powerful as gardius he cannot reproduce himself without a bride he cannot do it what a kite that's what God needs he needs what he wants he wants a bride he wants to be a husband and then that's why she wasn't a creation separate she wasn't a creation separate he created mama dog and daddy dog but he created Adam and he said Adam in order to reproduce you I'm going to have to bring something out of you and now what Christ did and then we come right straight out of Christ amen cuz look Adam was everything but a creator at that point he was everything but a creator you hear me he couldn't create a need God had to create an Eve because that was what the problem with Adam was and I see this because I go back and I've been kind of not want to act like Adam but you kind of think about you got to think about how this man was all of a sudden he was controlling everything I mean when he said elephant come here the elephant walked right up to him when he said elephant you don't need to be in this condition you need to go over here that elephant would just walk right over there and never say a word this one go over this way I don't want that tree there I want that tree moved now he didn't create another tree he moved and used because remember Jesus Christ never created anything when he came here when he came here he was a creator before the foundation of the world but he never stood here and created bread he used bread he used fish and multiplied oh that's weak okay some of them all right let's go questions and answers on Genesis but you see the plan of God is perfect the plan of God is perfect we would say we do in a different way and that's the devil if you say you can do it better than God that's what Satan's off Saints don't need to do it better than God explains that I don't think I want hi you know Eve you you're falling behind there honey you're falling behind you know the Beast is telling Eve's that you're falling behind there Eve you know look look at all these animals are reproducing and they're doing what God's Post told them to do and you're not doing it because it's just you and Adam you see what's going up because remember he had to get to Eve's emotion and talked to her brother Brent said if she would have not stopped and turned and started preaching to the devil come on somebody I mean if she would have stopped she did stop start preaching to the devil if she would have said let me go get my head let me go get at him and let's see what he has to say about this situation but no he he what he pride on her emotion amen let's read this and God take it from his side a piece of him a rib I made a woman now where did get the spirit woman see Genesis 1:26 he said let us make man in our own image after our own whiteness created him man male and female he made the burly spirit for the man he made the tender little delicate feminist spirit for the woman so he knew he was going to have some women that we've read this a couple of times I want you to see he knew foreknowledge he knew he was going to have some women so he just made this spirit right there the Bible said he would in 1 Genesis 1:26 she created in him man in a pre figure male and female a man see in a pre figure he made the woman and the man before they was ever formed out of the dust of the earth that's the Genesis 1:26 man and when God made the man not in his own image his body is not in the image of God his body is in the image of Beast a man now let's go to the next one to read it shorts the father 1953 now look when man was made in the image of God he did not fall remember the Genesis 1:26 men cannot fall never started to the ball never will fall we'll take some people it's that'll anchor in your soul one time that's why I love Genesis 1:26 because that is telling me I cannot fall I cannot fail you just hadn't read Romans one in a while heavy Romans 8:1 there therefore now what oh we can quote it we can quote it but can we live it but man was made in the image of God he did not fall when he was made in the image of I mean we made in the image of God he did not fall when he was made in the image of man he felt when he was made in the image of beasts or out of the dust of the earth that's where he fell amen and for the ones that have come here today I'm going to try to explain in a in a simplistic form what happened in the fall because it's really important that that we don't see that it was some type of fruit that man ate or fruit that woman ate if it was fruit then see listen if whatever made us fall something's going to have to turn us and bring us back and then so if we eat if Eve eat an apple or whatever kind of fruit you want to talk about because remember you got to remember one thing Moses wrote this to hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent if you didn't know that Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible so Moses was the common commentator writing what you're reading today a man and he wrote it several hundred thousand several thousand years after it happened so God let him go back in a vision and see what went on and he wrote down what God told him to write and remember one thing for sure you are the fruit of your mother you are the fruit of the production of your father and then by what by sexual desire on this side of the fall a man but before it wasn't going to be by sex it was going to by me by the spoken word of God but keep in mind he still had to have a bribe to produce it he still had to have the woman to produce his whole thing when man fell he fell in the image of Beast which was creative evolution hey man y'all have to really Amen these okay just say Amen pitiful amen amen God come from here I told Bobby I come from here you got to bring it out come from here all right that's good that was okay but God in creative evolution created this one remember he wrote it in the Bible water water animals land animals our sky animals land animals and then he comes over and then he brings man in Genesis 2:7 is that Alright just for a minute just for the just for the ones that are here with us today so I do believe in evolution but not like Darwin's evolution that this one evolved from this one no God in creative evolution he created it right up to the monkey or the chimpanzee and then we've always in school you sit there and you talk about a missing link between monkey and man I heard it I heard it with my own ears because it's all about the missing link they showed all the was a pro Magnum man and this man and this man it looked more like a look more like a monkey and this look like more like man and this looked more like man and then something happened there was a gap in there because man cannot procreate with an animal an animal can't procreate with man but in creative evolution God had in creative evolution he had to what stay in continuity there's one thing about God he never changes a man so in creative evolution because look a dog a doesn't matter if it's a chihuahua or a Great Dane they can procreate because they're in the same genus or in the same species right then all right at one going here but but we're going to do it for a minute so they're in the same species so they can procure gave that way right right then you come up and you'd say there's a gap here then you got man and woman but in creative evolution there's that missing link then something must be missing if it's a missing link a man the missing link was the beast in the garden in Genesis which was called at that time a serpent that's alright but he was smarter than any beast in the field even Scofield will tell you in chapter 3 now they don't have this but it had to be an upright creature a man an upright creature the missing leg the one going from the monkey a little bit more and a little bit more like a man and then you see Adam and then you see there's something in between that can flop over to their side or flop over to this side that's not so far fish and remember Satan is not a creator God's the only creator so Satan had to borrow a seed he had to borrow a beast he had to enter into that beast and then he had to take him over and then and cause him remember he was a gum brute he was a dumb animal but he was so close to the human side because they know science knows that that missing link is the link between animal and man so they must be there soon real close together amen done all right all right so what happened is Satan being right there next to God there all right being right there next to God he knew the principles of life well my heavens if he had a he had eyes he could see the the dog and the mama dog innovate and the daddy dog having puppies he could see this one over here even miss mr. and mrs. beasts having children he said how you know that well we're going to we may read it if we get to it that God came down and killed the lamb and throwed it into the end of the bushes well if I'd have been only mama lamb and Daddy lamb they'd be no lambs left a man so we know for a fact that there was procreation going on because remember procreation and animal kingdom it's not filthy is on our right because they have no conscience if you see that in the in the in the world where we we try to reproduce the best best and the best data we use this and we manipulate this to that and it's not vulgar right but with a man and a woman with a soul they can't go out and plaster you understand what I'm saying because that's vulgar because why because we have a conscious a man the Beast has no conscious a dog has no conscious right a dogsled by what by nature not a not an emotion that's why the woman that's why saying to look and say if I'm going to get to that woman Eve I can't go to Adam he had enough sense to know that Adam had this supernatural part about him that he was a little bit more on the spiritual side than the emotional side that all right can we do this okay so Satan enters into the beast because I'm sure that the beast being so close to the human that he was maybe used not as a servant but if he could he could move like a human the anatomy would be in other words that you could look down the line and you go man he's this person's close to us so Satan says yeah this is where I'll go I'm so handy in unto the Beast now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field and he said unto the woman so this guy must be able to talk he said to the woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden now that was Satan's question to you and the woman sent or the woman she wasn't easier and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden God told them he said eat everything it comes out of that off of those trees except one but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it why would you want to touch the tree and cause the fall why would you want to touch a piece of fruit and it caused all this that's a destruction no no no no no and the Serpent's enter the woman ye shall not surely die that word not one word because God said you shall surely die you touch that you're going to die the day you eat thereof the day you're going to die and then for God doth know that in the day you eat there I've listened to Satan then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil while knowledge how knowledge is power even may be thought you can know something the little before Adam that all right and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired not was that they never been an apple tree I walked up to and desired it hello there's not a fruit tree I got some pretty apple trees but I have never desired that tree so you understand what happened let's just put in plain language Satan entered the Beast the Beast talk to Eve got Eve to procreate with hurt with him and that's what caused the ball God said don't touch it and she did all right now let's go forward to Genesis 3:14 not all right well okay we didn't been through this a lot we know it was we know it was a sexual affair between even the beasts and the gardens while government's whole thing started that all right and man we don't you know you said well that's what we believe no that's what the Bible says that's what the Bible says that's not what I believe sure I believe it I believe it cousin what the Bible said and then because if you look through I've got it many many times in the Bible it talks about the fruit of the womb you are the fruit of the womb that's why don't touch that proof God said don't even pur take eat means to partake don't pertain to that stay away from it in other words listen God you're going to create we're going to be procreating anyway but it's not my sexual desire but by the spoken word of God just like it is right now amen and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle remember he was the Beast and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go he wasn't a snake to start with and then he was an upright beast he was that missing link above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go the property God said God changed his whole skeletal structure so that nobody would ever know that that that ever existed because remember a snake doesn't have what shoulders a snake doesn't have hips but you got all these other animals like a bear and a lion they have hips to have shoulders right but that snake has nothing but a head in the tail and one long vertebra nothing like me and you so there was everything God did he hit it from the wise and prudent hey man it's not foolish you can go all the way through the Bible amen all the way through the Bible and remember to remember Adam was not deceived Eve was the one that was to see the Lord God said to the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle about ever above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of my life now that is not just at that snake live and was on his belly and died that snake is the trail of that serpents it goes all the way all the way to white throne almost to the white throne judgment that Alright cuz look he's eating your dust we're going to the ground because what happened we are going to the dust and Satan is the one that's putting us there God puts you in there yep Satan put you in the ground okay because of the effects of the fall and God sent a list and I will put enmity already division between then the woman now watch between then the woman he is who the serpent alright the Serpent and the woman I'll put enmity between you and between thy seed now look Satan didn't have a seed that's when he got from the Beast because remember Satan is not a creator he had to use something that God had already brought listen everything is a perversion amen everything Satan is not an original anything he didn't originate one thing never will originate one thing never cannot originate one thing because he's not a creator I mean man even even Einstein prove it that darkness is not a creation it's just an absence of light hey man like the property God said he said relations between a man and a woman as a wife no problem he said but if you take the adultery part of it or you take a prostitute he said that's where you go wrong and then properly God tells us the riot act perverting a man the right act perverted now we'll put in with you why because it's a right orig everything of God is original and then Satan is just a copycat right behind it I promise you if say never brings you something if state never brings you something remember there's an original to come back there's an original to say get behind me Satan and then excuse me between thy seed and her seed now she didn't have a seat all right a woman is not a seed producer then all right a woman produces an egg which has no life in it that Alright wiggling muscles the property got there but no life the life is in the seed what says in her seed this is a promise of Jesus Christ the seed of the woman a man woman doesn't have a seat so it was somebody Bible so much this morning be it unto me according to thy word Mary said and what God forgives the egg and the sperm put it in the womb of Mary man had nothing to do with it there goes my God creating again a man Satan thought he had him fooled he was just fulfilling the plan of God and then in between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel a Calvary Satan Bruce listen you can't kill somebody by bruising their heel we hit him in the head one time it shall bruise thy head Satan we're goin straight to the head because remember Satan chose the head God chose the heart and he's going to what bruise his heel which is his flesh right while he's on earth but look at mighty conquer at woman seed out of that woman's seed look what he produced children the way it was supposed to be until the woman he said I will greatly now remember before the fall the woman and the man was together and then but now that was the Covenant don't eat that tree and you'll be fine we're reading just a few minutes Adam and Eve in the garden as long as they ate from the tree of life their use was being renewed amen now look they didn't have eternal life and nurse in their body not at the time amen right until the woman he said I will greatly multiply myself now why is he going to start in the conception and sorrow thou shalt bring forth children I thought God was glad to bring some children out that Genesis 1:26 men if I had been God I would have shouted for joy and they'd have been shot still be she'll go that's my children it's coming for for me I mean how we shot with our own natural children amen until they get older didn't we cry doesn't woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children now nothing coming from God's going to be sorrowful the reason this is because of the choice you made and then she's gonna have to now start bringing children through her nice natural womb not the loom of her mind because the womb of her mind was polluted first and then her body just followed right after that mmm cuz remember listen you cannot sin in just your flesh you cannot sin just in your flesh your flesh don't sin it's a product of sin but it cannot sin I sin in my inner man my inner man and then what happens is if I don't have any kind of buffer if I don't have the Holy Ghost to hold me what when I was out in the world you know if I wanted to go to a bar and buy a beer by didn't bother me one bit and I didn't drink that much but it didn't bother me I had no conscience now I don't even want to go but the same man that held him in I said many times before the same the same mouth used to curse people and kill them I hope now is the same mouth is used to maybe bring somebody to go it and do some good amen but God didn't wash my mouth out with soap he washed my mouth out with the Holy Ghost inside of me so what comes out of here from here God said out of the white belly out of the inward man and then that same man that used to speak lies and used to speak of cursing thank God you see right here I didn't set there and brush my teeth with Mama tried to one time brush my teeth with the soap ivory is not good when you taste it and that really does no good at all that just makes her happy right but when God watches your mouth with the Holy Ghost when God watches your mouth with the holy go you will not speak another word like he spoke before why because he watches you from the inside and then we're man bring forth children die desire shall be to thy husband what another covenant woman can't preach woman can't do why because she's she's deceivableness of telling you what brother said she's thousand times more deceived than a man and man I know the sisters are not going amend that but a man anyway my desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and to the end till Adam he said now see he's getting them all because remember before that God said who told you y'all with nigut adam said that woman you gave me he said even how did you know that a woman how do you know that she said that beast you gave me and plural beast he couldn't go no further because the monkey was going I didn't do anything but really a master way when I mean came down because remember the property God said he said in that animal that fell that's why they had to start doing animal sacrifices a man called to come through the animal animal kingdom and that's why in Romans 8 it and then it's over strike home it'll bless your heart the whole world is groaning why the whole world didn't groan when Adam and Eve was standing in the garden under the rule of the Holy Ghost and God leading them there was no problem there was no cheetah trying to eat them there was no lion that grounded him no they what everything was love you said they're going to be animals in heaven the Bible says the line will lay down with the lamb why because everything goes right back the whole world is groaning that's why that animal will attack you now you know why because he knows usually when it made the fall hello somebody because the atom was the highest form of animal and man and it had to start from the top that's why God didn't come back down here an animal he came down here is a man a man started it too high and into Adam he said because thou has hearkened to the voice of my wife and have eaten of the tree not a piece of fruit in other words / took of her what she gave him of which I commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground a look he couldn't curse the son of God he cursed the ground in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life I like what brother Joel said that's why God could not accept Cain's sacrifice Cain's sacrifice came from the cursed earth root and then we'll get into that I'm trying to get I'm trying to get it able and came out of the womb and I won't get it today we'll get it next time brother Andy don't come next week you're gonna try to come next week no okay don't we have a little vacation from us but I guess not all right let's look number three so then so the fall happened just to make a long story short what did God do God cast him out of the Garden of Eden right come in he actually killed the lamb pulled the skins off the lamb throw them back into the bushes and said here put this on because they knew they were naked then and he sent them out of the garden right this is what we're going to try to get to it's right here seven church ages in seven seals this is back in back in 1963 the breach alright here we go thank you now you rolled it down suckers hit after I fumbled for it for ten seconds now we don't need anybody to interpret that for us see for of course we know it was eternal life they had fallen from and they lost their claims on eternal life by the fall of Adam and Eve who fell from eternal life to death in the Garden of Eden and brought all nature under them to death all right a tree never died before Adam an animal wouldn't die before Adam there's only one thing that cannot die and that's good because he's eternal and that's the only way we can ever keep from dying we have to have eternal life in us so so it's then up here got brother Brad was not talking about their soul they didn't follow me colonel live from the Sheol Adam was the son of God he was the daughter of God goes right here it says the same thing we have to have eternal life in us to be sons of doors to go but now remember the flesh still died the flesh you're still dying and then because what did Adam lose but when we died as I said in the message this morning to sin we sold out our birthright and cross this chasm that was at enmity of that division that we can't get back listen God told Adam I believe this is I'm interpolating here God said Adam I cannot talk to you face to face anymore because of this horribleness of sin I can't come down to property guard said God will come down in the cool and talk to Adam and Eve face to face before the fall I'm talking like communion face to face and say that's my children but after the fall guard said now I'm going to put in with you I got to put a division between me because I can't stand fit there's got to be a blood covering there's got to be something in between me and you now because we can't talk like we used to could talk you have separated yourself and you cannot get back and step one way because remember Adam was the ruler of the earth but he could not die or give his life to go into Eve man that's what we're going to read it here in just a minute all these people that said that that Adam placing his natural seed in Eve I'll just read it right here brother Epson revelations chapter 1 he says Adam seed lost everything Adams natural seed listen if I don't natural Steve save it Steve Sade saved Eve why did they need a sacrifice why did they why did Abel's sacrifice why was it accepted if it was it listen the natural seeds what Cass hey come on people did great it sounds good it may feel good but in that what Satan talk to Eve to make her feel good it wasn't right one word off but he tried to get Eve to feel good about herself come on Eve me and you go help God and Eve you know instead was to see I got a man from God's will read in a minute I got a man from God how deceiving is that what a deception all right now let's finish reading this we sold out our birthright and cross the chasm now we're beyond the reach of God pull it back up on this other side of the chasm see we're beyond the reach of God in other words we can't take what we have and go straight in the presence of God with it we've got to have that blood covering brother Branham even said listen brother Branson even a Christian God only what hears your voice because if he come down through here not to kill you why because this is not so why you got to go to the ground if we can't get it if we can't get it if we can't get it it's got to go to the ground and man well the scripture says we plant them in corruption plant that means you put them six foot under you plant them in the ground in corruption and raise them in and corruption now of course when Adam fell to death he brought death upon all creation now he was given free moral agency it was given them just as week in other words just as we are to make a choice you can't say well I outside on the folder portal II bless your heart down with her fault no you got choice you're standing here just like Adam and Eve but we know one thing for sure that chasm has been brought back together having an earth has kissed a man now let's read them we sold our birthright now we were talking about a title deed it was what we were going to try to get to and it's almost 3:30 we may go just a little bit longer today but we need to get this book part out here okay let's go to number 4 revelation now notice what did we lose well it was given to Adam to have eternal life as long as he eat from the tree he had eternal life okay long is heat from the tree he had eternal life and we notice again that Adam was the he inherit the earth Adams inheritance was what the earth alright and as long as he stayed where he was supposed to be everything was alright okay and we noticed again the Adam was the inherit the earth he was like an amateur God over the earth the earth was his hey man God said here you can't carry an earth I'll take care heaven alright the earth was his everything was given no like an amateur God the earth was his everything was given unto his hand he could do with it whatever he wanted to he named it and called it and done whatever he wanted to he was truly a son of God now in the fall Adam forfeit the title deed to that okay he forfeit to Satan Satan took the title deed now remember we're going to read this a little bit further where brother Branham comes back and says Satan as I have the title deed the title deed goes back to the original owner Satan is just a squatter that all right listen Satan is not a squatter on the earth Satan just quarter right here this is the only earth I'm concerned about this big ball of Earth God said is going to be here and this it's going to be eternal and it's going to have a city setting on it and eternal people's going to live and be living on it but until that happens this earth right here is what I'm worried about hey ma'am all right Satan took the title deed Adam was very slothful and he did not redeem his right for he could not redeem his right why he crossed over a man I like what somebody said you know Satan Satan's sole purpose was to stop a son of God from being born and he did because when he polluted the wound with Eve doc said I can't do that no more I can't go this I can't go that way I'm not going that way that's not the way I want to go but he only potentially stopped a son of God because look what happened God came himself because he's the only one that can impart his life back into somebody that's sinful hey man Eve can Tim put me Adam couldn't impart his life back into Eve he thought he could he thought he could brother I'm said he went out to get her and found out when he got out that with her he's like what I do now what I do now that's why God said hold on a minute I'll make away you put these bloody skins on you go out there and you work arrestor your life and you do what you need to do Satan is going to eat your dust but I'm going to come as the seed of the woman and I'm going to put this whole thing right back together again hey man clothes remember I want you to look at something see if I'm right because I thought about this last night that title deed we say and I want to try to work this right because remember Adams sole purpose on the earth wake up and listen Adam sole purpose on this earth was to reproduce Jesus Christ or to bring Jesus Christ to reproduce God's children right brother branham said Jesus's body when it comes to what to eat the woman Eve that all right we okay with that so the whole plan is right there so that title deed is not every name it became a book of redemption but before the fall it was not a but listen the Genesis 1:26 men never needed redemption that's what struck me last night that title deed was after the fall and it became a book of redemption because you go over to revelations 5 and you had to have one take the book out of the hand of the original owner the original owner was gone he had the original Genesis 1:26 the soul of God that never fell but he became a book of redemption when we fell when Jesus took that book he took a book I'll be redeemed don't ever tell me you don't need redemptions I'm gonna tell you something that one inside of you does not need redeeming that's right if you're born again thank you if you're born again that inside of you never needs Redemption the rest of you does because I was looking for a quote and I couldn't find it last night I'll try to find it we're brother Branham said Adam when all this happened his whole nature was clouded everything was clouded - what he what he knew and everything behind him was clouded never and that's the same way with you and I when we're born in this world there's a nature attached to us and it's a fallen nature it is not the nature of God we come by permissive well which is not what the full will of God and man we come by permissive will but guess what now that we're in permissive well all we got to look is that Genesis 1:26 man is brother Dale was telling us this morning adenosine 1:26 man called my name call my name I want these heard a word of God call my name I responded because like brother Bob was talking about this morning my name was already there you can't respond to something if you never were it like I'm you know I'm going to Albuquerque New Mexico I've never been out cooking my life but I can't say I've been there but now when I come back I'd say I've been there hey man we are wait a minute I read treatment oh it's proper to go to poor man okay go keep reading it is the god of the earth the Bible says so he possesses that not because that he really rightfully gets it but he possess it am I saying Satan is just down here just a squatter that title deed what happened if you wanted to look it if you want to look at it this way in an illustration this is Genesis 1:26 okay alright this is look at this in Genesis 1:26 it was given to Adam to produce all the names right of the redeemed of the of the born again alright now what happened Adam couldn't do that anymore its way of producing it had been what and God just didn't seal it he put seven bands around it because remember that book of redemption has access to seal book that book was sealed he opened the book God sealed it back up and Adam had to hand it back to God and God said that's okay you couldn't do it anyway because you can't get into the believers like I can but I'm going hold on to this until I come on earth and a baby called Jesus and I'm gonna bring out Genesis 1:26 wrapped up in swaddling clothes hey man the first item came what not born again in this spirit I mean it's yeah in his body but he had the soul of Almighty God and man but when Jesus comes back he's the whole ego he's what he's the soul of God and man put in a flesh body that what came from God and man takes that Genesis 1:26 and he walks on the earth and parable of the sower of the seed parable to sow the seed who is the sole son of man is the sword the seed you listen to what Jeremiah said you listen to what Isaiah said now you listen to what I said now you get over here in acts and you listen to what my people said you get over here you listen to what brother Dale said you get over here you listen to what brother Aaron said you get over here and you listen to what this brother said that's the truth hey man that's the way it was supposed to come so the Genesis 1:26 man is alive and well today it looked bad back in the garden but it doesn't look bad today why because we fell and Lords to be redeemed if I was if I never but drowning in sin and drowning in shame and grounding in the water and God reaches and gets me and pulls me up and puts me in the boat and says you don't have to drown anymore and stupid don't jump back in the water I have saved you it's like we're there with some of this morning as well it's think about so sometimes God will he'll forgive you yourself put you in the lifeboat and our stupidity and humanity we just take a double dial backwards and go back in the water again hey man can I ask that guy one time he said I'm saved like you are Colette starts witnessing two had a beer in one hand cussing out of his mouth I asked him I said name was John stump works at the bank up in Gainesville I said John would you get safe from he said i'm saved i'm saved like you our old milwaukee cussing like a sailor I said John what you get say from if you got saved tell me what you got paid from he didn't have a clue what our coming his mom I probably told him he was a look you ever drowning in the muck of sin I'll promise you one thing when God pulls you out and you realize that you don't want to go back there again hey man you hear from your theophany you hear from that Genesis 1:26 man and there's the pull and man there's to pull that pulls us into God again because what we were separated and then all right now look let's continue reading here just real quick real quick we're going to get we're going to get Cain and Abel out of the womb here and just real quick but the title deed Adam had the title deed Adam had full control and he lost it by what by listening to Eve and walking wilfully out but come on people first Timothy 2:14 says Adam was not deceived but Eve was deceived an item walked out brother I'm said with both eyes open but he was but see he got out there and realized he couldn't help Eve they never could go back to that condition because what he didn't have the ability to take his spirit and put it into something else man he wasn't a savior listen Adam with a son of God but he wasn't the savior of the world man there's only one person that's a savior and that's the one that created you a man but he forfeited let's go all the way up scroll it up down or whichever I'm like lady with there will you look right there but he's forfeit to Adam forfeiture Kyle deed to it to this all this stuff that we own eternal life and the inheriting of the earth Jesus said in Matthew 5 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth done alright now we don't have it now hmm and look it wasn't to Adam or any of his seeds Oh Adam Adam seed absolutely lost everything - it's not the seed of Adam so there's no natural seed going to save us that's the perversion part of it no matter how much we try to beautify this world and how much we try to make big fine homes and things that still doesn't belong to Adam seeds no sir it did not go to Adam see because Satan took it lock stock and barrel right for Adam forfeited it hey man keep going number five this is still revelation chapter five number two now our kinsman has handed the seven sealed book of redemption from the original owner of the original owner when we lost it now look he doesn't say when Adam lost it when we lost it at the Garden of Eden through Adam it went back to the original owner but there's been a poster on the land a squadron that Satan he come over and he's a poacher this earth don't belong to him belongs to God but he's a poacher a squatter man how I could say something right now but I better not it's the Kyle deed of our Redemption this seventh sealed book it's the title deed you wait - again - those seals now watch this he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritor gives us his inheritance to his people now remember the proper guard said he said Jesus did not come in to bring you an inheritance your inheritance was before the foundation world he came back to get you away back to it I am the way the truth and the life I'm the door all right he gives the inheritance that he inherited what did he inherit he inherit eternal life in his body inherit eternal life in the soul listen if you're born again you already got your inheritance we're just waiting to realize that that inheritance for our bodies already been paid become kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us it all belong to him he was the one who redeemed but instead of keeping it to himself he gives it back to the people that his love for you and I are for us hey ma'am what did item lose he lost the ability to bring me in you on the air with no sin no sorrow no gray hair no old age all right let's read number six the Easter seal 1965 look God had had the same when he saw Jesus it was the finished work that God finished with Jesus when he said it's finished all the plan was finished and when the Spirit of God comes upon you and you truly are one of God's attributes that's at Genesis 1:26 men that he's spoken of now if you're not you'll wonder and frustrate and run here and there and everywhere else and never come to the knowledge of the truth if you are one of those the old things pass away right quickly see and you become new scrolled on up and you become new and the plan of salvation is finished you're ready to obey every word that God ever spoke of you see for you to do you're submissive to his word the contract exactly the abstract to the contract the title deed belongs to Oh belongs to whom I thought he said God had it but when God came down here and died went back across another dimension come back on the day of Pentecost it all struck off as it was at the day of Pentecost hey man where did the book go the book disappeared in Genesis all down to this all down through the Old Testament what blood of bulls and goats pushing our covering brother Harris head a capo that cut that cut it just it kicked over us and it followed through the Old Testament amen there was never a son of God in an Old Testament no no Adam was the son of God in the Old Testament he was the first item the first he fell the first item fell a man so now we come down to the second Adam he's standing in the same place he said get behind me Satan it is written use the Word of God it is written and then and he walks through the earth and he takes and says blessed are the meek blessed of the poor what so in what so in the seed word so that you and I could come run others book and we'll know one thing's for sure when our bodies changed we are truly fully redeemed and then the redemption story listen I like that song the Angels all will listen fine why they never fail for they cannot join that song when the redeemed are gathering in and then when the redeemed are gathering in alright let's go one more let's go to the very end here but God Almighty then listen this is his plan you can accept it or reject it this is it this is the way it happened you were born in sin from your mom and daddy or who had doesn't matter you got here God gave you a life come Satan can't give you a life but what does Satan do Satan attacks in nature to that life older dammit nature that old nature that's what reverts us back to the devil amen Roberta just back to the devil hey man and then God has to what come down and burn off get rid of that get rid of that old nature so that what you can hear the prophet of God you hear from that theophany how did you hear from at the opening somebody had to preach it to you you all I was sitting listen but what were you thinking about what were you thinking what some preacher had said the night before six months ago what brother branham you put you press the play button are you how to preacher come by and preach and you had to meditate on that and then God called your name and you heard from that that was already there listen brother brother branham ID reading it to that this morning you know everybody god forbid all the denomination you know that you know your names written on the book when you receive okay and I didn't know that was so much daddy was in the Baptist Church but I heard a Baptist woman tell me one time she said if that preacher don't do what I say I'm taking my letter and going somewhere else like that was really going that letter meant so much to them coach one yet names written on that letter your names written in heaven no let me tell you something your name was either written in the book before the foundation of the world all right we'll never be written in that hey man all right now after the fall let's go to Genesis 4 and we'll stop right here we're going to reach this and then we'll quit everybody all right and then it's a wonderful plan listen it's a perfect plan because God did it it's not a this is not a man plan this is a God Almighty plan that works every time never does fail if it failed this because you fail and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bare Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord knowing that she had had relations will that be and she again bare his brother Abel so they were twins amen they were twins you see how can that happen it's happened many times before the wound doesn't close up until like 24 hours later once you sew there was a conception not long ago in in California where a woman had relations with a black man in the morning and had relations with her husband in the afternoon and guess what they had twins the woman was white and one was black right so that's documented that proves what God says a man that proves what happened in the garden right because brother Brown said to Eve even the Beast in the morning even at him in the afternoon I'm even told when he was you reckon he might have went back in the vision and anyway if Moses could I know the prophethood and she again bare his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but came with the tiller of the ground now look before them remember they didn't know good and evil the only new good that all right because remember Satan tells Eve said if you'll if you'll partake of this you'll be like God you'll know good and evil so the two spirits come right down and works into these two guys and what we're going to do next Sunday is we're going to show and bring in and see how that those two spirits work but we're just going to read this and then quit because it's almost 4:00 and she again bare his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain with the tiller of the ground so Cain was wiped from the seat of the Beast Abel's from the seed of Adam okay all right all right that's what we just been explaining the whole time all right and in in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offered it unto the Lord now look at that that's capital L cap sold teller he brought it straight to God and then he laid it right before God and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock firstling that means there was some more of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering amen but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth now look look at the ad that cane had and his countenance fell because remember let's be real honest Cain didn't have a daddy that was live Bob Kane's daddy is now crawling on ground hey man so Adam had to be both of them daddy and he wasn't Cain's father that all right that's the way it happened but Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell in other words he had a chip on his shoulder and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen if thou do us well if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou dust not well sin lies at the door and into thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him he's given Cain an opportunity to do what Abel did but you see them two spirits have to come down and they have to be close but one has to reject them one has to accept a man one has to accept and one has to reject same thing with right now now let's read James 1 verse 14 and we'll start there next Sunday James 1:14 says but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when the lust has conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death you got lust conception sin and death you see how it happens when lust is conceived it brings forth sin when sin is finished it brings forth death he said brother what are you talking about we were brought here in lust we were conceived in sin and man but we can stop this thing right here because when it's finished it brings forth death and your soul today if you don't have the new birth you can stop that death process you can stop it today now we still get older those two spirits are still going to work we're going to talk about next Sunday where the two you'll look at the two spirits and Abel and Cain and read a little bit further but let's stand to our feet musicians come but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed so listening we're all tempted right some of you are both better than others I guess we're tempted every single day of our life but there's something that holds me not not anything I've done but I have to like both elf is what I have to believe I have to believe to be able to receive the blessings that God has for us it was a horrible thing that happen in the Garden of Eden horrible cause never sinned death anguish every bad thought everything it's you every time you have a problem think back to the garden so that's where it happened but now there was a reversal of lack when the second Adam came and he's brother Brian told us he said God's going to prove the Satan that the second Eve which is what I'm looking at today will not fall she will not fall for that one word off and then so how can you say we're failure if the second even the prophets are in spoke because the second Eve will not fall will not fall come what may put us in the ground for what will come up first a man will be changed before the lot of people are a man but you believe that what God has done for you he started before the foundation of the world slaying the lamb before the foundation of the world put your name on the book before the foundation of the world signed sealed and delivered it was all you got to do is it's just accepted just say I see my name in that block name goes on the book before the foundation of the world now we know there's different sections the book and it goes on one side as a believer sure that's brother brain was trying to tell us a story man because Judas his name was put on the book but Judas his name was not put on the book before the foundation of the world as an eternal person no it was written in the book of life the book of life is everybody's name and then he was stricken off because of what his choice his choice struck his name off that book but see God knew that before the foundation of the world brother brown said hold that word redemption that word Redemption I'm telling you that's why the sons of God shouted for joy they saw the plan of redemption we now clearly from the beginning of time before the beginning of time like a prophet of God said before the eternal we see where we come from what we're doing here and where we're going and then because Redemption is not replacement brother ray we know that redemption is taking what fell picking it back up and putting it back into position it's supposed to be it you and I have a position to rule and reign over this earth that's our position not to rule and reign like people rule and reign now no that's not right the Bible says the meek shall inherit the earth I've never seen many meek kings and rulers and no look in the television you'll see they're not very meek people they want to destroy you or they want to do something no the meek shall inherit the earth God has given us this earth but he's working on this earth first and man he's working on this earth he's still working on me why to get this man what just moved me over and put me where I'm supposed to be you got but how you can't stand right here you got to do the same thing you gotta say I'm standing here this is my position and man realize that realize your position what you're doing here what is your what is your purpose because remember here we go again God's plans eternal he saw your purpose before you got here he knew what you do when you got here he knew what you do with it when you got here let's just fulfill the purpose the plan and purpose of God let's sing a song you have a need let's sing this is the evening time on page 523 523 okay page 522 let's say you're working it babe [Music] Oh [Music] Hey they can again Oh [Music]
