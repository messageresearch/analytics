Incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection least that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Cast Away father we're in need of you this morning Father father we see the great things you've done here in this sanctuary and in this Church Father we know that we are

Jesus died for me and you he says know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth a prize he said so run amen so run this morning run that you may obtain I'm thankful this morning that we running to obtain the great price Paul said I've run the race I've kept the pace amen and there is a crow of righteous laid up before me I'd like to talk about when we start out this race we know that we come when we was born into this world we was born in sin shaping in iniquity we come into this world speaking lives but I'm thankful this morning that there's a there's a greater way I'd like to call that this first light this first birth that we come to is a sack that we all was given a saw we was given this sack to car to running this race and you know in this sa we didn't ask for the things that was put in it we put in the things when we was born in this life you know and the first thing we had was we we was born a liar we was born a thief we stole we we had those Natures in us because even it's small children we see that when they're little that you don't have to tell them how to lie they already know it right because we didn't ask for this s we should have come a Divine way we could should have come through the spoke word of God so we didn't ask for this sack to start off with this morning I want us to look into our sack this morning and see what's holding us back that we may run this race run this race and that we will be able to stay in keep our keep the pace this morning we want to look and see the things we started out with in this life a lot of times we start out in the Life maybe as we come to maybe as maturity as a you know from a small child we go into school and we add we had rocks into our sack you know that makes us wait us down things that we've had in our lives that happened to us and Satan has added these rocks you know a lot of times you know we we come we went to school and we want to be the smartest kid in school you know and it just wasn't meant to be for that a lot of times maybe some of us did you know some of us accomplish those things but you know a lot of times maybe the the people made fun of us or they or they done something to us and know and that added a rock in our sack that we didn't need you know l times it took God's grace for us to overcome those things you know when I was a young kid in school you know they like to make fun of because I was born with a club foot they said I'd never walk but God created ankle bone so I'm standing here by the grace of God even though I just come out of surgery about 8 weeks ago but I'm doing very well by God's grace but God has given us the ability this morning but we look at that you know and a lot of times you wanted to be the you want to be the first one picked you want to be the first one when they had a team or whatever the thing was you want to be the first first one picking you a lot of times you was the last one picked you know Satan had that to he was trying to build a complex in your life he was trying to add something to your sack to make those that weight so heavy and so heavy and weighted down that when you run this race brother said when we have all these weights that's so easy to beset us in this bag you know it's trying like trying to run a race with a backpack full of rocks oh yeah we're not going so good sometimes we feel like we're just running and getting quick sand yeah but a lot of times I'm here to tell you this morning that God wants to empty your sack this morning God wants to take out all those things that we've carried around for years in years and years you know a lot of times we come up in school you know then we get into church you know a lot of people have become Church hurt oh yeah you know we went to certain churches and certain preachers hurt us you know what we come to church for deliverance but you know what a lot of lot of times we come to church and the minister has not come to the place of few maturity I'm not talking about here but you we set under a certain headship and you wanted to leave the church let set free but you're left with a heavier weight than you did when you come in but this morning we're not going to leave with those rocks in the back you know what you come to such a place to where you couldn't trust ministers anymore and Satan said well I've added another rock to them you know I've added that rock of complex being last and I've added them another one where they don't trust nobody you know we come through this life and we realize that God has given us the ability to unload that sack this morning because he wants to put rocks in our sack of Revelation peace Joy longsuffering all the great things there are our benefits there are the things that God has given us and we need to put those in our CL those rocks are so they're light amen he said come unto me all you that he weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest you know a lot of times we try to start this race we try to start this race and we come into this race and we don't even start the outset of the race right you know a lot of times we hear that even out into the church world we heard it so many times you know they preach of prosperity I believe in prosperity I believe in spiritual Prosperity I believe in the natural Prosperity but I believe I believe what the Jesus said in Matthew chapter 6 verse 33 he said but seek ye first the kingdom of God and all his righteousness and all things shall be added unto you right amen you know a lot of people that come out there say well Lord I want you to save me but I got some things I want you to give me I want you to let me have these things but you know what if you can seek you first the kingdom of God Amen and all his righteousness everything else will be added unto you so a lot of times we begin to worry and we begin to threat over things maybe financial troubles but let me tell you Satan has added that rock in Us in this age that we're worried about things but the Bible has a commission a covenant he said if you'll seek ye first the kingdom of God and all his right then he'll add everything else to you right he not provide all our needs I don't look like any of us has been starving no I don't look like any of us has been poor we we're not living in shacks and all those things you know we might not have everything we want but I tell you what when we've got God we've got everything a lot of times we might not understand I've had in my whole life had not understand how you might pay the light bill yeah how you might not be able to pay your house payment but let me tell you what we serve an all time God I've seen you meet my needs every time every place everywhere under every condition amen GL he's not a god of poverty no but you know what when they teach those things they get you to looking the wrong way and you know you like to use that prayer of jbz yeah that increase my borders and grab all these things but they fa to use that part where J has prayed and said Lord if it's a hindrance to me if it's an added Rock in my sack that I don't want I don't thank God for unanswered prayers a lot of times we pray for things that God given to us and he won't give it to us because we don't have need of it it would be an added burden or an added weight to our back we see that a lot of times if we don't talk the Christian race the right way then we're already disqualified or we have to come God's provided way right right you know what a lot of people have depended have Satan has deceived a lot of people because they think it's just been a change of mind oh my come on a change of thinking or turn over a new Leaf oh my come on or made a better decision in life come on but let me tell you here this morning just a better decision or a change of mind won't take you out of here right it must be a heart changing this thing that happens in your life must be a born again experience with God I'm so glad that God took that nature away a lot of times we started out this race when we was in sin we had pits bad habits oh yeah you know I want before the Lord got a hold of me I smoked cigarettes I drank I done all those things I shouldn't do but you know what I'm glad that God emptied my sack you know and people said how did you quit smoking you know what brother brother Dale what I didn't what I didn't I come to understand is that I didn't quit he took it from me heed that sight and you know when he he begin to take those things away from me you know and they say you know they think well you know you just turned over you did it by self-will and I begin to ask God one day I said Lord how come I always tried to do those things within myself how come I tried to do them and I couldn't never accomplish he said because if it was by your own power then by your own power you could go back and get it he said because I took it I took the want to away so you don't have that desire anymore I bur every bridge I throw out every Rock I'm so thankful that the Holy Spirit has that ability to take those things away you know what a lot of people base their confession as a Christian on the five sentences you know I felt something and I believe you do right I'm not against feeling I'm not against emotion and I tell you what that's all we got was emotion then one day we're going to begin to cry and weep because look at let's look at Esau even through all his emotions and all his desires he weeped and he cried and he still couldn't receive what he hadn't because he had already sold out his birth right back that rock that he needed and he was Glory he had it he he had the right that right but he sold it out for for a you look at many others have done it we look at we have to be careful as ministers the prophet said it's money women are proper land but you know what we preach on money and women a lot but what about proper land you know a lot of preachers like to car up they going to rock in their sack they look out I have preached for this brother and I have preached for that brother and I've been here and I've been in this message so long but that's good and that's fine but if it's just that rock that you got if you're not built upon the rock of Jesus Christ it's not what we've done or what we could do it's what God's already done all we're doing is walking in the vision right we're walking in the light this morning yeah you know what the the main sense then the only sense that makes any sense is the sick sense you know what because he says this what the word says He agrees with what the truth is the other sense is you can't make no sense out of them you know when I was out in the world you know I was in the racing so much brother D that I if I depended on my senses i' have thought I had something special from God oh yeah a lot of them doing they saying they have something just because they cry I would have never thought that a man would cry over the death of a race car driver yeah but you know what when dve Allison got killed I cried yeah I felt something but it wasn't God right it was an emotion it was a stimulation from one of those other S one these senses but it wasn't a divine revelation of Jesus Christ amen but when Christ came in my heart Glory let me tell you when he come he changed everything I'm glad when he put that Holy Ghost in there and he fed my heart with the Holy Spirit you know what when you say well I'm afraid to let you know lot of people say well I'm afraid to let brother so and so go here brother so and so or go to this church or that church and we should stay at our post to you but sometimes when we're on vacation or something we were to go to church you know but like you go down there that guy teach you something you know it might might capture my people a lot of people think he good to cist at their crowd but hey if they if anybody can take your people they wasn't yours in the first place I mean cuz if you take their people then somebody take yours I mean it's that way we got so many people tossed about we need to have stability we need to have the assurance that God is able to keep us I'm glad that God s a in a certain town right to lead us and guide us but when we lean on these other senses these other rocks they love to to us any that's why we got so many people all these strange doctrines yeah return Ministries oh Two Souls five Souls you might as well have five you go let's go with a good number let's go with a good number we don't have all them we don't have all them rocks at least give me five rocks David had five rocks in his smooth rocks in his back but we have to be careful of right you know what those people are sincere right but they're sincerely wrong so the Hindus they're sincere but they're sincerely L we shouldn't walk by and think we're better than them but we ought to pray for them exactly you know what he said he'll know that you're my disciples that you pray ye one for another that's the way you get healing right to pray one for another Glory that ye might be healed I'm so thankful for that that God gives us that we depend upon what we have felt and what we expen and what we experienced in our feelings a lot of times instead of uh on what the real divine revelation of Grace is you know Jesus has got rocks he wants to put in our bag too rocks of Revelation Glory I believe there's a stimulation with this exactly I believe I believe the stimulation of the word of God causes something to happen in your body in your soul in your spirit right you know a lot of times we accept the Rock of a new spirit yeah and we think that's just good enough but brother said let's don't stop at a new spirit that was the nature that that you was able to be able to worship and to be able to talk with God come on but a lot of people say I got the Holy Ghost but they've only had they've only had a new spirit come on because they still have those things in their heart they still have those desires the Holy Ghost don't have no desire to lie the Holy Ghost don't have no desire to cheat the Holy Ghost don't have no desire to steal right only the Devil by that wrong nature that wrong sack of rocks we started out with I like what Deuteronomy says in 2513 he says Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights of Great and Small that's what about that's that's diversity of things in our lives that's why the prophet that's why the prophet here Paul said let us lay aside every weight is so easily Bes set us and let us run this race I like what Proverbs said too in Proverbs 1611 says a just weight and a balance of the Lord's all of the weights of the bag are his work right all the weights in that nature that he has given us you know why we got so much confusion around the message because we haven't had a blood transfusion the DNA the blood of God when you got confusion that means you don't you haven't had a trans conf usion you haven't had a you Haden had a born again experience with God that's right God is not the author of confusion right Glory he has never come to confuse right but he's come to give wisdom and knowledge and understanding I like what Hebrews 12:1 says is wherefore seeing we are also our compassed about with so great a cloud and witness he said let us lay aside every weight and sin which that so easily beset us and let us run this race with patience the race that is set before us you know what a lot of times we get impatient because our bag is so heavy and we're not moving as fast as we think we should but I'm here to tell you this morning he said come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest we have to reach forward with persistence right you know brother my brothers and sisters this morning the kingdom of God is pressed into right it's not just it's just not something that we can that we we have to wrestle we have to press oursel even when we begin to pray we understand that when we begin to pray a lot of times it seems like our prayers go no higher than this ceiling but you know what that don't stop us right we're going we got to press into this Kingdom we just keep on praying and say God I know because your word said over in Peter your ears are always open to the cries of your children and your eyes are upon the righteous and your face is against the wicked one I'm glad we have that promise this morning right I like what Paul said to us in Philippians 3:13 he says Brethren I count on myself to apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before he said verse 14 he said I press toward the mark of the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus you know what a lot of times we can't forget the things that we've had in our past amen a lot of times Satan brings those things up our past failures our past mistakes and a lot of times we carried those things down and we live a defeated life brother said we live so far below our privileges exactly you know why cuz we're so weighted down with the things we our mistakes our heartaches our troubles but you know what we can say that like Paul said he said brother and I count on myself apprehended because he was wanting the new body yeah a lot of people have the rock that we're in the Millennium but let me tell you I'm disappointed he said I was going to have a new body not this man amen not a man with a club foot not a man that gets sick not a man that feels sorrow and Agony and defeat right but a man that is Victorious right and newbody in Christ Jesus right he said I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto the things which are before he said I press toward the mark of the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so we see here I imagine when the Lord come to Paul that day and spoke to him when he was riding down to persecute the very Church of the Living God he had done stood there and held the coat as they Stone Steven yeah and when God spoke to him and said Saul Saul why persecuted thou me he said Saul it's hard for you to kick against the PRS a lot of times God is trying to get us to move forward he was wanting to press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus but I can imagine through Paul's life at the things he had done to the church I believe there was a lot of way in his life oh yeah in his sa that he he had he he had took and he had carried through his life I imagine a lot of times when he said when he said there is a minister of Satan that has come to Buffet me oh yeah I imagine that minister of Satan come to talk to him said now Paul we realize and I know God has spoke to you see Satan will never deny that God is God oh yeah but he said but Paul look at here how can you through your emotions or maybe so he said you're just probably worked up Paul because you think God would have allowed you yeah to have let those people Stone Sten yeah and I imagine that was a heavy weight to be on Paul's mind can you imagine that right how many people would have voted him in to be the pastor of the church right look at the resume of Paul right you know a lot of people we think we had to have a resume to be a preacher no we have to have the Holy Ghost right we're going to have a gift but I'm looking at Paul and that begin I I I believe that kind of weighed him down in his life a lot of times you know because when you go through you know brother Dale when you preach on Sunday morning or and Sunday afternoon when you preach and then that next day see Satan's there oh yeah he says I remember when he was under the anointing yeah but now I want to see you live that life right you talked a good talk but I'm glad there's something on the inside that can help us that can make help us accomplish that life for it's more than just preaching a sermon brother said leave me a sermon you know for your action speak loud than your words you know a lot of people have the ability to preach but they don't have the ability to live the life right you know if you hadn't been born again you'll never be able to live the life so I begin I imagine when Paul said I went to the up into the third heaven and he called all those Revelations you know Paul could have had a big old rock of he could have got a big head oh yeah I mean because God showed him things he said I can't even speak you know and he begin to break for the word and he begin to give him the revelation of Jesus Christ God in flesh yeah and he begin to work on him he begin to show him those things he begin to open up all those Revelations to him all those things that just shall live by faith all those great things that he had all those wonderful sermons he preached and I I believe Satan said now look at here Paul we know that you have you have a lot of head knowledge but really has it been Revelation To You Paul come on you know a lot of us around the message we got a lot of head knowledge but has it become a revelation to us has it become a divine revelation from God L have we just been taught a lot of things I think we've been taught we've been taught a lot and we shouldn't have a lot of things but Paul said he had taught those Corinthians a lot of things too when he said I come to you that I might give you meat oh yeah but I found out just still on milk right you know because they still had weights in their life they had fussing they had back biting they had arguments they had troubles in the church we should be going beyond all those things we should press toward the mark of the high calling if there's a brother having trouble in church you shouldn't go tell everybody about it exactly you should pray for that brother or that sister amen but a lot of times we get in trouble we pick up that old rock of foam and we begin to talk to one another say well you know brother sww he's a good brother but but that rock but is a big old rock and you know what we a lot of times we make we we get in a lot of trouble with that Rock right you know we come into the house of God and we should have good things in our sack but a lot of times we'll take our the things that God has shed us and we use it on one another that's why we've not come to full maturity yet that's why we've not come to the full place of adoption amen is because we have we've still got those rocks in there and you know when it's just just because you might know a little bit more than another brother or sister doesn't like you any greater than them right cuz look at you would have never thought Luther would just a little simple Revelation he had could have turned the Catholic Church upside down he didn't have what we have He Still Smoked a pipe he still drunk beer I'm not condoning those things but you know he had to come to maturity too and you know what they without us cannot be made perfect right so we need to go strive on into Perfection right coming into perfection in God's word the only thing we have had received the perfect word to take a perfect WRA there is rapturing faith in this message so we must lay away all those rocks when we take those rocks a lot times we see a lot of times that somebody might know a little more a preacher thinks he's a little better than another preacher or maybe more mature but he is if he is that's great yeah but don't be little your brother or your sister because he's not come to that place yet but strengthening Paul said I become all things to all men that I might win some to Christ I was talking to brother Tim's Dad one time when he was able to talk and he said you know what made brother rown such a great man he was able to come down to their level whether it was a man with a PhD or it was just an old farmer you know what how can you how do you if you come to a farmer and you start talking all these things you load his mind right this message is an atomic bomb we must win them through love right but you know what that's the rock that we need more of and it's probably the smallest rock yeah in our bag until we come into perfect love we're not going to get out of here right I like how the brother brand worked on the Infidel by the little apple tree he didn't come to him and say look right here in Revelations look over here Romans 8 he said well L you know my mother always taught me to give a cow enough run you'll hang there it's the Simplicity of the Gospel it's the simple things you know we sometimes I think we we make it so hard that the people can't apprehend it yeah you ever had somebody say some things and you're like I like what brother Cal said he said some of them guys come in they preach so deep said my my church they has to have a dictionary to keep up with the great big words they speak that don't show God God was simple he come in the simple way he the the what was the great about Jesus Christ is that he was able to take them he never went down to their level but at their level he was able to bring them up to his level there is the key to witnessing gory and to being able to win people in Christ just live a life you don't have to preach to him this guy working told me said man I like you he said a lot of preach a lot of lot of uh Christians they they want to preach to you cuz you're a sinner he said but you don't ever say anything I said well brother I figure you know what condition you're in you don't have to tell me I don't have to tell you what you're doing wrong right I said because you got a conscience yeah but I said one thing about though if you ever get the Holy Spirit you wouldn't do the things anymore I said but I'm not here to make myself better you know that's what I liked about my pastor brother de when I first met him when the I wasn't I wasn't living right my mother said I want you to meet my pastor he's painting across the road there he's painting some apartments and went over there and there's another brother you know had long hair and you would never think that me now people say man that guy yeah ain't the same guy that's true I'm not right but that's only by his grace and I went over there and had the whole thought I was a ZZ Top and all the old long beards Brother Richard I thought Bo I was the man yeah you know I thought I was tough but I found out I was nothing you know and I went over there and this other brother you know he said now you to tell brother Richard there said you to tell him he needs to clean up and cut that hair and straighten up and start serving God you know what brother T said he said man leave him alone he said he's a sinner yeah he said that only God can change a man right you know what that was special cuz he didn't blast me I went back across I said mom I like that old boy I said he didn't judge me you know what we had to we had to understand you know we're supposed to judge judgment begins at the house of God well we got to be careful with that rock who we throw at and he said judge not least you be judged yourself he said go and restore such a one amen and the faith least you fall into temptation yourself a lot of people that fell into temptation their s look at Jimmy swager when he begin to tell on the man the pressor instead of going to him and trying to keep it quiet and try to restore him back to Faith and if he wouldn't he could have exposed it but yet he blasted him and guess what the same thing happened to him we better be careful how we broadcast one another's faults somebody might me broadcasting mine and yours one of these days that old rock is awful big when it comes back your way it feel it's pretty light when you throw it at somebody else but when that thing hits you boy you know what that thing about so you better be careful how you throw that rock lot of times we just put that rock back in our sack say Lord you if they be any Rock God he showed all those self-righteous ones when he come out there and they was going to Stone the woman and she was C into the very Act of adultery he said ye without sin I always think about that brother de you without sin cast the first stone I'm like boy that disqualify me I bet he said from the eldest to the least left the eldest thought we can't throw that thing me sin I know I made a mistake I know I've done things brother said we sin daily that's and the Christian's the only one that sins she was a sinner man exactly see it would have been a sin for them to Stone her cuz where was the man that should have been both of them where was he he was caught to right they let him go they judged him all right yeah they Jed her wrong yeah they was both gifted right Sin Sin no matter what it is ain't no white sins no black sins ain't no big sin little sin sin is unbelief brother say smoke is not a sin cursing is not a sin he said unbelief that's the attributes of it that's the action that you got sin in your life if things like that you batt through things in your life that you want to talk about somebody and you want to do things and you want to always want to judge people that's the wrong Rock that's the wrong Rock to have in your sack this morning right Jesus come he said I come not to destroy the world but I came to save them I'm glad he didn't come with a back full of rock from judgment come on all he had to do was move one finger and he could destroyed and change the whole thing right but he was obedient oh yes to the death of the Cross even humbled himself to the death there right he went there he didn't complain and murmur like me and you do when we go through things what kept the women the the children of Israel in the wilderness for 40 years they're murmuring and complaining right we hear lot that well you know my pastor he's not that deep he don't go that deep in the word yeah be careful old cor right old Dayan you better be careful what you say about your pastor better be careful what stone you pull out you know what that's that's where we make mistakes you know what then we start to be judge uh ministers who's the deepest who's the greatest I can I can answer that very simple Jesus Christ right he's the deepest amen he's the simplest he became all things all you know he laid aside every weight you know what he had Desires in hisself said he could had a wife I know they got that out now with the through the D Vinci Cod that he had a wife Mary magdal all that's just worship of woman exactly we know that yes he could have he had the right to but he did he forsook all things are we willing to forsake all things that we might do the will of God do you realize that Jesus died in the garden of gend before he went on the cross he died to his own will he said nevertheless father not my will but thy will be done but you know what the greatest rock in our bag I believe a lot of time is self- will our desires our motives we got to check our motives and our objectives with the w we still have a year of thermal oh yeah we still have the prophet's quotebook the Bible right you know we still have the word of God but said anything in anything that the angel spoke to me that wasn't in this Bible I wouldn't believe it exactly it's just we didn't know where to look because it took a Divine interpreter of the word of prophet sure to come to us and show us these things to open the word of God to us well I'm thankful for that you know what and the greatest thing is we have a Rock of undis in our life undecided where don't we really have I do I have the holy ghost or don't have yes that's the greatest thing we battle a lot of times that in self will is look Satan says well you know if you really had you wouldn't have done this you wouldn't have done that but you know what it's what this it's it's your desire to serve God right it's not to by we're not rap rap by how many mistakes we've made in this life even Elijah said he was a man of like passion he had mistakes he made F he had faults he had failures but when he prayed right he knew who he was talking to Glory you know what he prayed for three and A2 years it didn't rain right he believed in who he was praying to right it's not the we if we s we sin willfully I mean if we just do it because well that's our desire we're in trouble we haven't had a birth yet right that's the wrong Rock but once you get that rock once you get the Holy Spirit living inside that soul that old man is dead and you become a new creature in Christ Jesus all things have passed away all things you know what brother de I didn't know you know what I was raised around the message but you know what I never knew how precious the Bible was until I had a born again experience oh you know what even though we've been raised around the message and we s in message churches young people that's not good enough you know what I was depending upon Daddy and Mama's religion right oh and they had it they had the goodies I never got it well until God who's rich in Mercy gave me the same experience you know what I thought I'd be all right you know what the prophet God say God don't have no grandchildren right just because Mom and Daddy's got it that's not going to be good enough right they can be your Holy Ghost till you get to a certain age but then you're going to be accountable for yourself right you know what but I believe the the Holy Ghost is so rich to us brother that even While We're Young it said in John received the Holy Ghost while he was in his mothers right I believe we can pray and ask God to do that for our children Amen to fill them with the Holy Spirit they might come into this life knowing who they are they're a son and daughter of God glory I like the scripture my mother had in her bag she carried around all the time brother de she went to Brother Tim she said the more I pray for that boy the worse get brother Tim said praise God sister one of these days he's going to get so bad he'll hate himself and that's what it took I had to hate myself but you know she held this one rock train up a child good when it gets old it won't depart from you might depart from it but it won't depart from you you know what that's what when everybody else is going to do something brother they was something condemn me I said man we shouldn't do that stuff man they said man what do you mean ain't that R said man it just ain't right you know what the one would get in trouble they do it and I'd get to blame because I was with the wrong crowd the other guys are way by while I went in the police car I said look that was hey they was giving me their rocks I was guilty because Association you know what when we're born in this life this natural birth we're Guilty By Association we come through the wrong desire through an act of man and woman coming together inste the spoken word we're Guilty By Association the first qualification of a Preacher is to be blameless amen and without the Holy Ghost there's none of us blameless I know there are certain things that we have this qualifies them to but the main thing is the Holy Ghost he forgives us of all things he changes Our Lives I know we can mess oursel up and disqualify our but I'm thankful that God kept me right he kept me cuz I was going to boo boo boo and he kept me right he kept me in his hand I mean I still had smoked and done those things should do but he held me cuz he had work for me to do I'm glad he's able to do that right he kept the prophet didn't he but the prophet need the Holy Ghost too didn't he right he was going to kill him oh yeah he was going to kill him boys with the 22 rifle oh yeah and the man that pours this dog he said I was going to kill him see why we need the Holy Ghost oh yeah the only thing control this desires but said you're never going to perfect this man he's a cuckle bir people get around you know a lot of people get head and I know God use lot and some of us in different levels of maturity people I get people they say man I I'm already perfect oh yeah I'm like woo and that's a powerful Stone that's right that's a powerful Stone right I don't know no one that was perfect that walked on this Earth that was Jesus Christ we're coming to Perfection the only only thing perfect about us is his blood his blood was the perfect atonement for me and you his blood cleanses us from all sin he said though your sins be as scarling they was people say well you know you know I never done all those things I never done all those things I'm already there but you know what a lot of people just St around and think they're all right just like they are no you ever went out the World never done you just sit right here in this on this Pew and die and go to hell right exactly oh yes it's a very dangerous thing right am the thinking that your own righteousness is good look at the Sadducees and Pharisees they thought their righteousness was good enough look when they went down and the one went down to pray and the other one the old siner was there yeah he knew how to pray right we got to watch how we pray he said I'm glad I'm not like this man come Wonder a lot of times that we not think that way a long brother I'm glad I'm you know what and I had the Lord he was dealing with me I went and seeing the guy brother Aaron and he's a good friend of mine he had a breakdown Lord it just got a hold of me started moving in my life and changing things I went to visit him and he had had a mental breakdown you know what humbled me is when I went to see that guy the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said that could have been you right that could have been me laying out there drunk in that gutter when I ride by and I see that drunker or that homeless man or that prostitute right that could have been us it's not for Grace I'd have been nothing more than the empty space if not for Grace a wasted life a wasted life is a life that's not lived for Christ Jesus amen you know what he bring us in this life that we might live for him I'm so glad that God has given this us the ability through the born and again experience of God glory you know there's a lot of shapes and sizes of rocks in our lives you know just because it's a little Pebble of sand we think that might not be but you know what if there's enough sand in your sack pick up a little old bag of sand that's about 3 lb and pick up a bag of rocks is 3 lb they weigh the same they're just bigger there's more of them it's just a rock pulverized down to the size of sand right A lot of times we're carrying around a big old bag of sand and we don't realize we have Ro rocks in our bags we think those little he said last side he said what the problem is is we have the little foxes yeah that small spoth the vine it's the little things says it's the little bitty things we left undone right and they add up and they add up you know what every time we come to the house of God every time we come to the to the house of God we either leave Better or Worse exactly we have to be careful what we pick up at church you know a lot of us in this church and we leave more weighted down than we did when we come here you know why because we pick up a lot of things that other people are letting go of we go down and pick up our brothers and our sisters rocks oh that God has delivered them from we end up when we don't come to the house of God with the right M attitude we don't come with the right expectation then we leave with rocks that we didn't want to have we leave with things in our life that we didn't have before but we have added to our sack may we all stand this morning just a simple thought about God's grace may we every head bow every eye Clos just want you to look at these things this morning by the grace of God is there something in your sack this morning I want the Holy Spirit to do a spiritual X-ray on me this morning don't he hear I want him to I want him to look all look look
