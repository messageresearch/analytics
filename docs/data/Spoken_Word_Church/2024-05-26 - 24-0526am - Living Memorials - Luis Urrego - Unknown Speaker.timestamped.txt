[0:21] and help us to receive something that
[0:22] would benefit your people Grant it Lord
[0:25] Jesus we ask these things in Jesus
[0:27] Christ's name amen praise the Lord being
[0:30] that tomorrow's Memorial Day I wanted to
[0:32] speak this morning about living
[0:34] memorials I know that kind of sounds
[0:36] like an oxymoron a little bit cuz a
[0:38] memorial is is is you're remembering
[0:41] somebody that has passed away uh but
[0:45] there are memorials I believe that of
[0:48] people that have gone on that are still
[0:50] affecting our lives
[0:53] today Jesus Christ being one of them
[0:56] right he's not he's not dead but but so
[0:59] we just wanted we wanted to to to to to
[1:03] talk about about that because we want
[1:06] our lives to end up being a living
[1:08] Memorial right that what you do or what
[1:11] you say or or or is still affecting
[1:15] people even though you are gone and um
[1:19] and so we we want to talk about that
[1:21] what God considers worthy of of
[1:23] remembrance amen and we want to turn to
[1:27] the scripture or you can read here but
[1:29] it's in Matthew 26 6-13 and that to me I
[1:33] consider this Jesus even considered this
[1:35] a living Memorial in verse 6 it says now
[1:38] when Jesus was in Bethany in the house
[1:40] of Simon the leper there came unto him a
[1:43] woman having an alabaster box a very
[1:45] precious ointment and poured it on his
[1:48] head as he sat at meat now there are
[1:51] four different instances in the
[1:53] scriptures where women came and anointed
[1:56] Jesus two of them on on on his feet uh
[1:59] two times on on on on his head this case
[2:03] it was ano anointing on o over his head
[2:06] and it says here but when his disciples
[2:08] saw it they had indignation saying to
[2:12] what purpose is this waste so to them it
[2:15] was a waste a waste of time or a waste
[2:18] of money because that alabaster box or
[2:22] and even the the the container that it
[2:24] was in it was very very expensive
[2:27] and and they say here that for this oint
[2:30] might have been sold for much and given
[2:33] to the poor it was considered what she
[2:36] had poured over Jesus's head consider
[2:39] one year's wages for the people back
[2:41] then but she considered it worthy to
[2:45] pour that take it no matter how much it
[2:48] cost and pour it over Jesus's head why I
[2:51] believe there was a revelation there
[2:53] amen she did something out spontaneous
[2:56] out of Revelation and and and and and
[2:59] she didn't see it as a waste for her
[3:01] amen and then when Jesus understood it
[3:04] it uh understood it he said unto them
[3:07] why trouble ye the woman in other words
[3:09] why bother her for she hath wrough a
[3:12] good work upon me for ye have the poor
[3:15] always with you but me ye have not
[3:19] always for in that she hath poured this
[3:22] ointment on my body she did it for my
[3:25] burial in other words like as a as a
[3:28] preparing him for his burial
[3:30] verily I say unto you I don't know if
[3:33] you can see that down here or not verily
[3:35] I say unto you wheresoever this
[3:38] gospel wheresoever this gospel shall be
[3:41] preached in the whole
[3:43] world even in Lula Georgia we're talking
[3:46] about it right now right right that's
[3:49] right it's we're fulfilling what Jesus
[3:51] said right here amen wherever soever
[3:54] this gospel shall be preached in the
[3:55] whole world there shall also this that
[3:57] this woman hath done be be told for a
[4:00] memorial of
[4:02] her amen he wasn't saying a memorial of
[4:06] him or a memorial of Memorial of her
[4:09] because she did something spontaneous
[4:12] out of Revelation and it wasn't
[4:14] something contrived and it wasn't
[4:16] something thought about it was as far as
[4:19] uh well if I do this maybe I can get
[4:21] this out of it or no it was something
[4:24] spontaneous that she did Jesus saw that
[4:27] Jesus knew that and therefore he he uh
[4:30] considered it as what she did to be
[4:33] wherever this gospel goes this this
[4:36] thing that she did is going is is going
[4:38] to be talked about throughout the whole
[4:40] world and I'm sure it has already
[4:43] wherever this gospel has gone so um it
[4:47] was going to be a memorial of her amen
[4:51] so what what is a memorial a memorial is
[4:54] something that keeps remembrance alive
[4:58] such as a monument a speech a ceremony
[5:01] or an act that commemorates it's a token
[5:04] of remembrance it's not just a day to
[5:07] shoot fireworks and drink
[5:09] beer and have cookouts man but you know
[5:13] I'm not from this country I'm originally
[5:16] from Columbia South America I have
[5:18] allegiance to my own country as well
[5:20] however I am a United States citizen and
[5:23] and and I respect what the people and
[5:26] the man who fought for this country um
[5:30] probably a lot a lot more than what
[5:32] you'd think and and and even though I am
[5:35] not from this country I I I I I know
[5:39] that man fought what whatever the
[5:42] reasons were for the wars or whatever it
[5:45] was but they fought for a good purpose
[5:48] and so um we it's nice to have a
[5:51] memorial for those men that gave their
[5:54] lives so a Memorial Day is for those
[5:57] that gave is for those that were in
[5:59] armor forces and that gave their life
[6:01] serving while Veterans Day is we we we
[6:04] we honor those that are still even yet
[6:07] alive so there's the difference between
[6:09] the two and so I I respect those men and
[6:12] I know that there's men that have gone
[6:14] on um uh already that were Believers and
[6:20] uh and so we just respect that but it's
[6:22] a token of remembrance and that's what a
[6:24] memorial is it's something that keeps
[6:26] remembrance alive so this woman what she
[6:29] did
[6:30] what she did it was something that was
[6:32] going to keep her remembrance alive you
[6:35] see so that's what a living Memorial is
[6:38] amen we can learn and we can dissect
[6:41] that uh uh of what she did into very
[6:45] minute pieces and and and get different
[6:47] lessons from there but we don't have
[6:50] time right now but you can go back and
[6:52] read it
[6:53] yourself and so but the the main point
[6:55] was to remember what she did for the
[6:58] Lord amen
[7:00] praise God and of course Memorial Day
[7:02] originally known as Decoration Day is a
[7:04] Federal holiday in the United States for
[7:05] honoring and mourning the US military
[7:07] personnel who died while serving in the
[7:10] United States armed forces now here's
[7:13] another Memorial that the scripture
[7:14] talks about and it's in Joshua Joshua
[7:17] 4:5 it says and Joshua said unto them
[7:19] pass over before the Ark of the Lord
[7:22] your God into the M Jordan and take ye
[7:25] up every man of you a stone upon his
[7:28] shoulder according ing unto the number
[7:31] of the tribes of the children of of
[7:34] Israel and this is the Lord telling this
[7:36] to Joshua that this may be a sign among
[7:40] you that when your children ask their
[7:42] fathers in time to come saying what mean
[7:46] ye by these Stones then ye shall answer
[7:49] them that the Waters of Jordan were cut
[7:52] off before the Ark of the Covenant of
[7:54] the Lord when it passed over Jordan the
[7:57] Waters of Jordan were cut off and these
[8:00] Stones shall be for a memorial unto the
[8:04] children of Israel
[8:07] forever it's it's this Memorial right
[8:10] here is commem is commemorating the
[8:14] Living God Amen of what he did for them
[8:17] at that time and what he is going to
[8:19] continue doing uh uh for them and what
[8:23] he's continuing to do for us now amen
[8:26] cuz our God isn't
[8:27] dead amen you know our soldiers have
[8:30] gone on and they're not here with us
[8:32] anymore but God Amen he he he died rose
[8:36] again amen and we're living a ser and
[8:38] serving a living God this morning and in
[8:41] verse 23 of that same chapter says for
[8:43] the Lord your God dried up the Waters of
[8:46] Jordan from before you until ye were
[8:49] passed over as the Lord your God did to
[8:52] the Red Sea which he dried up from
[8:54] before us until we were gone over and
[8:57] this is the purpose that God had for
[8:59] this that all the people of the earth
[9:02] not just for the Jews that all the
[9:05] people of the earth might know the hand
[9:07] of the Lord that it is mighty not that
[9:10] it was so you know we just look at what
[9:13] God did in the past it was so great
[9:15] that's wonderful but that it is mighty
[9:19] what he did for them amen he can do for
[9:21] you he can part your your problem apart
[9:24] amen dissect the thing amen and you
[9:27] cross through Amen on dry ground amen
[9:29] amen right that it is mighty that ye and
[9:33] this is the purpose that ye might fear
[9:35] the lord your God
[9:37] forever I don't know if you can see that
[9:39] or not but that that is that is the
[9:41] purpose amen that God allowed for the
[9:44] children of Israel to put these 12
[9:46] Stones and stack them on top of one
[9:48] another when they were getting ready to
[9:50] take the promised land
[9:52] amen and so it reminded me of of Matthew
[9:56] 25:35 and if and you go back and and and
[9:59] and listen to brother brandom's uh
[10:01] message time tested
[10:03] memorials it's a short message but it's
[10:06] packed very very powerfully packed and
[10:09] this is the scripture he us his opening
[10:11] scripture Matthew 25:35 Heaven and Earth
[10:15] shall pass away this is Jesus speaking
[10:18] but my words shall not pass away amen
[10:22] praise God and so we see that that at
[10:25] some point Heaven and Earth uh Peter
[10:27] talks about it that heaven and earth and
[10:29] the elements thereof are going to melt
[10:31] with fervent heat amen the the the the
[10:35] the elements of this Earth will be
[10:37] destroyed amen and and and and and and
[10:40] God will create a new Heaven and and a
[10:43] new Earth amen but his word amen
[10:45] whenever you you take his word and you
[10:48] put it into action and it becomes a
[10:51] revelation to you and put it into action
[10:53] amen that is something that can stand as
[10:56] a living Memorial right and that if if
[11:00] if affected somebody in a positive way
[11:04] right they'll always remember that amen
[11:08] they'll always remember that I I've
[11:10] always said that when you give a gift to
[11:12] someone amen when you give them that
[11:14] gift that and you look at that gift that
[11:18] gift is not to for them to look at it
[11:21] and it remind them of themselves or
[11:23] remind them of somebody else no every
[11:26] time I look at that gift that that
[11:28] someone gave me it reminds me of The
[11:31] Giver right it reminds me of the person
[11:34] that gave amen and so that's what that's
[11:38] what happens when you give amen that
[11:40] woman that anointed Jesus amen what is
[11:42] it what does it remind us whenever we
[11:45] read about it reminds us of her we don't
[11:48] even know her name right there's other
[11:50] instances where we know it was Mary the
[11:53] the that the uh uh Lazarus brother uh
[11:57] that and that and John is giving her
[11:59] name and we'll read about it we read
[12:01] about it here in a moment but to to that
[12:03] specific woman that anointed her head we
[12:05] don't even know what her name is we just
[12:07] know it was in Bethany and yet we still
[12:10] remember her and he said Jesus said that
[12:12] wherever this gospel goes this W this
[12:15] that this woman told will be will be
[12:17] will be remembered and so God's creative
[12:19] word is still standing and it's still
[12:22] creating amen how many how many believe
[12:24] that that when God said let there be
[12:27] amen that's still resonating like an
[12:30] echo it's still creating I believe amen
[12:34] it's still creating amen life in in in
[12:37] in you and I amen his word Never Dies
[12:40] his word continues on praise the lord
[12:42] it's like an echo amen and it has
[12:45] creative power even thousands of years
[12:48] later after it was spoken amen that's
[12:51] why Jesus could say heaven and Earth
[12:53] shall pass away but my word shall not
[12:55] pass away amen now we do have also
[12:59] negative
[13:00] memorials and brother brandham in that
[13:02] message time tested memorials he talks
[13:04] about a man he didn't remember his name
[13:06] and we'll read the quote here in just a
[13:08] moment but his name was Chester ble and
[13:10] I went and did some research on this guy
[13:13] and he was a hardcore atheist and he was
[13:15] an Infidel and he he would tell you that
[13:17] he was he didn't care about he didn't
[13:20] believe that there was a God he didn't
[13:22] believe that uh uh and and so he had a
[13:26] statue made of himself which is this
[13:29] this is the picture was taken in the
[13:30] early 1900s he wanted that statue to be
[13:33] placed on top of his grave and it's h
[13:36] Standing On Top of the Bible and and and
[13:39] and and and declaring um something there
[13:43] on on on that on that thing he's holding
[13:45] up um and he died in
[13:49] 1908 and he's he's he is uh he is said
[13:54] to have said that if there is a God let
[13:56] snakes run over my grave
[13:59] and according to Legend or according to
[14:03] to what some witnesses have have said
[14:06] and testimonies from different preachers
[14:08] and different people who have visited
[14:10] that site and even what brother brandham
[14:12] said they said that this man's grave
[14:14] that's a it's located in a beautiful
[14:16] Cemetery in a beautiful area but this
[14:18] man's grave has snake holes all over his
[14:21] grave site and snakes constantly walking
[14:24] around garter snakes and black snakes
[14:26] going around so you ask what you what
[14:30] you what you know what you claim you
[14:32] know then he got what what but some
[14:35] people have said that they they had
[14:36] moved uh they ended up having to take
[14:39] that area off because they needed to
[14:41] create a road through there or something
[14:43] like that so they moved his grave up
[14:46] somewhere and somewhere higher uh with
[14:50] other Graves and the Builders of the
[14:52] constructors they said that they didn't
[14:54] see any snakes so it's conflicting
[14:57] testimonies however
[14:59] the thing is is that this man's
[15:01] testimony is a negative testimony that's
[15:04] the point whether there was snakes in
[15:06] his grave or not the point is is that
[15:08] this man's life has a positive Memorial
[15:11] a negative Memorial about him this is
[15:14] what brother brandom said one Memorial
[15:16] that I'd like to refer to now it's in
[15:17] Ohio and there was an Infidel I forget
[15:20] his name I got the picture somewhere
[15:22] there in my collection at home where he
[15:24] was so firmly against Christianity till
[15:27] he wanted a Memorial built to him
[15:29] after his death with his foot on the
[15:32] Bible pointing down like that and saying
[15:33] away with religious superstitions and up
[15:36] with modern science and when he was
[15:38] dying he said if I've been wrong
[15:40] serpents will crawl out of my
[15:42] grave and when he died they were still
[15:45] shoveling the dirt into the grave and
[15:47] they killed two or three big vipers and
[15:48] today in that graveyard a minister taken
[15:51] a picture recently and brought it to
[15:53] show me and hanging over the chains
[15:55] around his lot the graveyard is a
[15:57] beautiful place and I saw that picture
[15:59] picture it's online you can look at it
[16:01] yourself there's snakes hanging hanging
[16:03] from a from like a fence the graveyard
[16:05] is a beautiful place but his Mound is
[16:07] nothing but a snake Mound and no matter
[16:10] even into the Fallen winter serpent
[16:12] still crawl from his grave a memorial
[16:15] and brother BR says God forbid me ever
[16:17] have a memorial like that or any of
[16:21] you so this man he he this is the
[16:24] memorial that he wanted of himself and
[16:25] he got what he wanted right that statue
[16:29] that he made of
[16:30] himself uh you can't see it very well
[16:32] right there I faded it out but that
[16:35] statue that he made of himself it's got
[16:37] It's it it it people would shoot it it's
[16:39] got bullet holes all over it he's it's
[16:41] got even a bullet hole right here in the
[16:43] middle of his forehead and it was so it
[16:47] it was getting to be so damaged because
[16:49] people hated hated that that they ended
[16:52] up taking the statue down and now it's I
[16:54] don't know where it's located but it's
[16:56] not on top of the monument anymore but
[16:58] it's very bad badly
[17:00] torn now compare this Memorial to the
[17:03] memorial that that woman that anointed
[17:05] Jesus head had this is the memorial that
[17:09] this man
[17:10] left what about the compared to that
[17:13] Memorial that that woman that anointed
[17:14] Jesus head so whether whether there was
[17:17] snakes or not at his gravide the point
[17:19] is that the monument that he had made to
[17:21] be erected for his memorial after his
[17:24] death is shrouded with negativity
[17:27] spookiness and disrespect from the
[17:30] public God help us not to have a
[17:32] memorial like that
[17:35] amen other negative memorials that we
[17:37] can look at in in the Bible is Lot's
[17:40] wife and we know that the decision that
[17:42] she made she loved the world too much
[17:44] she loved Sodom and gomorra too much and
[17:48] of course as she she was trying to she
[17:49] was trying to do what the angel was
[17:51] telling her to do trying to leave but
[17:53] something just made her turn back and
[17:55] she turned into a pillar of salt and
[17:57] according to uh what archaeologists have
[18:00] have have uncovered she's still standing
[18:02] as a pillar of salt there today the
[18:06] Tower of Babel amen a project that was
[18:08] started by man amen but the project was
[18:11] halted and and God destroyed it God
[18:13] didn't allow that to continue because it
[18:15] was man-made it was maned it wasn't
[18:19] originated by God or or or or Revelation
[18:23] amen as for example like this woman uh
[18:26] uh uh who went and anointed Jesus
[18:29] uh head amen that was something that's
[18:31] something Eternal amen but the Tower of
[18:34] Babel was something that was it was
[18:36] man-made it was what man was trying to
[18:38] do to get to God Amen and not what God
[18:41] was trying to do into man to for him to
[18:43] come to uh closer to man see that's what
[18:47] religion is religion is what you do to
[18:49] try to get closer to God Amen
[18:51] Christianity is what God has done to try
[18:53] to get closer to us amen praise God and
[18:57] you can look at nebuch as's dream statue
[19:00] amen it's repr represented four kingdoms
[19:03] that Daniel he interpreted but uh when
[19:06] you read that there was a a stone that
[19:08] came down from the top of the mountain
[19:10] and destroyed that thing amen and that
[19:12] stone represented Christ amen all the
[19:15] kingdoms of this Earth all the ideas of
[19:18] this Earth amen all the scientific the
[19:22] so-called discoveries of this Earth will
[19:24] fall they won't go anywhere amen but
[19:27] God's word will remain amen God's word
[19:30] is eternal Amen brother random says in
[19:32] the message super he said the United
[19:34] States a few years ago tried to make a
[19:35] suers ship they made it so they said it
[19:38] would never sink it couldn't be sank God
[19:40] put the Titanic in the bottom of the sea
[19:43] shows that man's achievements will never
[19:45] amount to anything it's all dust and
[19:48] going back to the dust that's what's in
[19:51] him and then in a message be not afraid
[19:53] if it wasn't of God it won't amount to
[19:57] anything we can't say that about the
[19:59] woman that anointed Jesus head right
[20:03] because we're still talking about it
[20:04] here in the small town of Lula
[20:07] Georgia wherever this gospel goes amen
[20:11] that woman's testimony was is going to
[20:13] live and it's going to be spoken of and
[20:16] if it's of God who is going to stop it
[20:19] all right now if that see what is it
[20:21] every plant that my heavenly father
[20:23] hasn't planted will be rooted up amen
[20:26] all right this is the the the the Judas
[20:29] amen um in the same in in here in in in
[20:34] the in John chapter 12 says then Jesus 6
[20:38] days before the Passover came to Bethany
[20:40] the same place where he was anointed on
[20:43] uh by the woman on her head where
[20:46] Lazarus was which he had been dead whom
[20:49] he had raised from the dead there they
[20:50] made him a supper and Martha served but
[20:54] Lazarus was one of them that sat at the
[20:56] table with him then took Mary which is
[20:59] Martha's sister a pound of ointment of
[21:02] ner very costly it must cost a lot
[21:06] because the Bible says it was very
[21:07] costly and anointed the feet of Jesus so
[21:11] in Bethany this other one he was
[21:12] anointed in the on the head here he's
[21:15] anointed on the feet and wiped his feet
[21:18] with her hair and the house was filled
[21:20] with the odor of the ointment now watch
[21:22] what what what Judas says about this
[21:24] then sayth one of his disciples judas's
[21:27] scariot Simon son son which should
[21:29] betray
[21:30] him now there's one of the things that
[21:33] we recognize and that we know about
[21:36] about about Judas is day we don't think
[21:39] about him how how what the good things
[21:41] he did for the poor or or the things he
[21:44] even did to Jesus amen we think about
[21:46] him as him being the son of predition
[21:48] the one who betrayed Jesus that's his
[21:50] memorial right why was not this ointment
[21:53] this is what he said why was not this
[21:55] ointment sold for 300 p and given to the
[21:57] poor
[21:59] this he said not that he cared for the
[22:02] poor but because he was a thief there's
[22:04] another Memorial of G of of Judas he was
[22:08] a thief and the Bible called him a thief
[22:11] and had the bag and bear what was put
[22:14] there in then said Jesus let her alone
[22:17] against the day of my burying hath she
[22:19] kept this for the poor always ye have
[22:22] with you but me ye have not always amen
[22:25] so judas's actions were memorialized by
[22:28] having but have negative light and no
[22:31] positive lessons right well you can't
[22:33] get anything positive from his actions
[22:36] here in this particular in this
[22:38] particular scripture right so that's his
[22:40] memorial right that's what he left
[22:42] behind and I'm going kind of quickly
[22:45] because I I'm trying to finish this and
[22:49] so here's here's here's these acts of
[22:51] humility by these women man in both
[22:54] instances Jesus was in Bethany that's
[22:56] significant within itself but you can
[22:58] study that on your own uh one woman
[23:01] anointed the head in Matthew 26 Mary
[23:03] anointed the feet in John 12 both Acts
[23:07] were done spontaneously with Revelation
[23:10] and anointing because they wanted to not
[23:15] because somebody told them to or forced
[23:17] them to amen but because they wanted to
[23:20] do it it was something about the life of
[23:25] Jesus that spoke to them that made them
[23:28] want to do this service for for for for
[23:31] Jesus all right that's how we should
[23:34] serve the Lord amen man not because
[23:36] you're forced to or not because uh
[23:39] because somebody will speak against you
[23:42] or or or something like that or because
[23:43] you don't want to go to hell amen it's
[23:45] because you want to do it amen because
[23:48] you you want to serve the Lord and it's
[23:51] in me I have no other there's nothing
[23:53] else I can do but to anoint his head and
[23:56] anoint his feet amen with my life life
[23:59] amen and let my life be a beautiful
[24:01] fragrance to him amen these two women's
[24:04] Acts were accepted by Jesus while while
[24:07] while Judas was rebuked by
[24:10] Jesus these women's Acts were accepted
[24:13] their Acts were properly memorialized
[24:16] and positively talked about today we
[24:19] talk about them in a positive light
[24:20] today don't we amen but we don't talk
[24:23] about Judas in that same way do we why
[24:26] because he left a negative Memorial
[24:28] yeah and I believe these actions they
[24:31] type the bride the second Eve this bride
[24:34] will receive the word of life and she
[24:36] will not doubt it like brother brandham
[24:38] said right they saw life in Jesus and
[24:41] therefore they acted upon that the word
[24:43] of life will put the the bride into
[24:46] action amen she recognizes the word as
[24:50] her head the bride recognizes the word
[24:53] as her head she knows what he wants done
[24:57] with the word she knows that right she
[25:00] only does his will or she keeps
[25:03] still right that's why these women they
[25:06] man when they went to anoint Jesus amen
[25:09] they just knew maybe it wasn't in their
[25:12] place to do that because they were maybe
[25:14] ill famed and they had bad uh uh
[25:16] reputation amongst the people I don't
[25:18] care I'm going in with what I got and
[25:21] Jesus accepted that and that's how God
[25:23] wants you to come amen with uh with with
[25:26] just as you are amen
[25:29] she only does his will or she keeps
[25:30] still the bride knows that it has to be
[25:34] God in her doing the works amen praise
[25:40] God Amen so a few more positive
[25:43] memorials the cross and what Christ did
[25:45] there for us the woman and the two mites
[25:48] right rahab's actions in the Old
[25:50] Testament we talk about those things in
[25:53] positive life Esther's actions right
[25:56] Ruth's actions
[25:58] amen the faith of Abraham we talk about
[26:01] those things those are living memorials
[26:05] that are still bringing life into us
[26:08] today amen they have a lot of types
[26:12] right praise God brother brandom says
[26:15] this and I'm almost done it says he says
[26:17] in time Testament more so we today as
[26:19] the church you're to put on the Rob of
[26:21] Christ the whole armor of Christ the
[26:23] whole shield and Buckler and armor that
[26:25] we might stand blameless at that day he
[26:28] is looking for time tested memorials as
[26:31] he can say there's my servant I've
[26:33] tested him I've tried him I've put him
[26:36] through like job there's another example
[26:39] we don't talk about job in a negative
[26:41] light right his life still speaks to us
[26:45] right he still proves 100% God be
[26:47] merciful to us that we can take God at
[26:50] his word and be time tested
[26:54] memorials amen that we can take God at
[26:57] his word and be time tested memorials
[26:59] not question it not doubt it but take it
[27:02] at take it for who he said it I believe
[27:04] it amen and move on with it praise God
[27:09] so what kind of Memorial are you leaving
[27:11] behind is my
[27:13] question ask another question what do
[27:15] you want people to say about you at your
[27:19] funeral think about that what do you
[27:22] want God to say about you all right I'd
[27:26] want God to say Well done good and
[27:28] faithful servant thou has been Faithful
[27:30] over a few things I will make thee ruler
[27:32] over many things enter thou into the joy
[27:35] of thy
[27:36] Lord you know that that that question
[27:39] what what live your life according to
[27:42] how you want people to preach at your
[27:45] funeral right what will your mom say
[27:48] about you if you passed away what will
[27:50] your daughters say about you what what
[27:51] will your son say about you what what
[27:54] what will your family your friends your
[27:56] co-workers what what would they say
[27:57] about about you live your life that way
[28:01] and you can be a time tested Memorial
[28:04] amen the things you do for yourself are
[28:06] gone when you are gone but the things
[28:08] you do for God and for others remain as
[28:11] your
[28:11] legacy amen and those things there will
[28:14] be time there will be living memorials
[28:17] because they will continue to impact and
[28:19] change
[28:20] lives as they are remembered not just
[28:23] something that's dead or live or sitting
[28:25] there and you know it it causes
[28:28] confusion more than it does life no not
[28:30] the examples we just talked about and I
[28:32] want my example to be that way amen amen
[28:35] God bless you all amen praise the
[28:39] [Applause]
[28:45] Lord just leave this up
