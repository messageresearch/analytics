[21:16] appreciate the Lord amen appreciate
[21:18] God's people 1 John
[21:21] 4:16 and it says it like this and we
[21:24] have known and believe the love that God
[21:27] hath to us
[21:29] God is love and he that dwelleth in love
[21:32] dwelleth in God and God in him may the
[21:36] Lord add His blessings to the reading of
[21:37] the word you may be seated amen I like
[21:40] to take for a little thought this
[21:41] morning amen just a real simple preacher
[21:45] amen a a Psalm of
[21:48] remembrance and for a theme do you know
[21:51] the love of God do you know the love of
[21:54] God now if it'd be all right I want to
[21:56] read that again out the amplifi
[21:58] it says and we
[22:00] know understand recognize are conscious
[22:04] of by
[22:05] observation we've observed it and by
[22:09] experience and believe a here to and put
[22:13] Faith in and rely on the love God
[22:16] cherishes for us God is love and he who
[22:20] dwelleth and continues in God dwells and
[22:23] continues in him amen so do you know the
[22:27] love of God brother s it like this on a
[22:29] a message have faith in God 1954 he said
[22:32] brother sister he said that's what the
[22:34] world needs today it's a more love of
[22:38] God Amen I believe that this morning
[22:41] amen he said that's what the world's
[22:42] hungry for today it's more love of God
[22:46] hey I I you know I say like this and
[22:49] this ain't in my notes but this will be
[22:50] free amen and it just like this I
[22:53] believe you know that we all go through
[22:55] things we all go through situ
[22:58] situations and sometimes we don't know
[23:01] you know what others go through until
[23:03] maybe God allows us to go through
[23:05] something and then we realize that hey
[23:08] every one of us have problems every one
[23:10] of us have have desires every one of us
[23:12] make mistakes every one of us have
[23:14] issues amen and we are to pray for one
[23:17] another and love one
[23:20] another amen I think sometimes God
[23:23] allows us to go through things so we'll
[23:25] know how to feel for one another
[23:29] amen I believe we need more love for one
[23:32] another
[23:34] amen hallelujah I think they was talking
[23:37] that brother white said he's been going
[23:39] through the statue of a perfect man you
[23:41] know I believe had there was one that
[23:43] came to maturity in our day showing us
[23:45] that there was going to be more come the
[23:46] same way is that right amen so I believe
[23:50] we need that love that God has that we
[23:52] need love more love for one
[23:55] another Hallelujah that we can pray for
[23:58] one
[23:59] another Hallelujah I want it so much
[24:04] amen hey I've been told that when the
[24:07] prophet was in in Old Mexico and that
[24:10] blind guy came through the line he said
[24:12] he he said he entered into compassion
[24:15] into love he said he put his shoulders
[24:18] to see if his coat would fit him I
[24:20] believe brother R would have gave him
[24:21] his
[24:22] coat put his foot beside him said he was
[24:24] barefooted to see maybe if his shoes
[24:26] would fit I can give him his
[24:29] shoes what about me and
[24:31] you oh God help us this morning amen oh
[24:36] we need to enter in and feel for one
[24:38] another amen we all got loved ones that
[24:40] are lost amen and the only way they're
[24:43] going to see God it's through me and you
[24:46] amen we had the Bible says we are
[24:48] written Epistles there's that book again
[24:50] read of all
[24:52] men wonder what they read when when they
[24:54] read our lives I hope they read Christ
[24:58] amen he said that's what the world's
[25:00] hungry for today it's more love of God
[25:03] he said if we show a little more love to
[25:05] one another little more love towards God
[25:08] how much better are churches and
[25:11] individuals and how much better we'd be
[25:13] if we just love one another amen if we
[25:17] love one another then we can can love
[25:20] God for God is
[25:22] love if we love one another he said amen
[25:26] then we can love God for God is
[25:29] love amen oh let me talk about for just
[25:33] a little moment about the Christian
[25:35] experience amen amen cuz I believe how
[25:38] cuz it said we we learn these things by
[25:42] observation and by
[25:44] experience amen we have to experience
[25:47] something in order to tell somebody
[25:50] something amen so let's just talk now if
[25:54] you were to ask the so-called Christian
[25:56] and you say well brother d boy you say
[25:58] so-called Christian cuz everybody that
[26:00] says you're a Christian is not a
[26:02] Christian this
[26:03] morning everybody says you're a bride's
[26:05] not
[26:07] bride amen everybody says there a
[26:09] Believer is not a Believer this morning
[26:12] amen so if you'd ask a so-called
[26:14] Christian about his experience of the
[26:16] love of God his answer would raise
[26:18] doubts you may think well I I really
[26:21] don't know if he really loves God or
[26:23] not or or he would show reluctance about
[26:26] his experience
[26:28] in other words he would kind of you
[26:29] would think well I don't know if he's
[26:31] really experienced what he's talking
[26:33] about amen he said his experience of the
[26:36] love of God but he said if you'd ask a
[26:39] real true born again Christian his
[26:42] experience of the love of God just just
[26:44] say in one statement his answer joyfully
[26:47] he would say and I say joyously because
[26:50] you know what Joy amen the love of God
[26:53] is the joy of the Lord is our strength
[26:57] let me say it like this we are to be the
[26:59] most happiest people if you've heard
[27:01] that statement before we are to be the
[27:03] most happiest people in the world but ha
[27:06] happy it know it comes from a word that
[27:09] means ha or happen in other words in
[27:12] order for you to be happy something has
[27:14] to
[27:15] happen brother Wade shakes your hand and
[27:17] you're happy they say they sing your
[27:20] favorite song and you're happy the
[27:22] preacher don't step on your toes and
[27:24] you're
[27:26] happy yeah but joy comes from a
[27:30] different Source all together it comes
[27:33] from the Creator itself amen and if the
[27:36] pastor don't shake your hand if you
[27:38] don't get the raise on the job you still
[27:40] got joy and the joy of the Lord is our
[27:45] strength
[27:46] hallelujah amen so joyy he would say I W
[27:50] say nothing about myself but I will
[27:52] speak in the honor of God and I'm
[27:54] sweetly constrained to affirm that I
[27:56] have known and have believe the love
[27:59] that God have for me I believe he's got
[28:02] love for
[28:03] us
[28:05] amen listen again
[28:08] 1963 standing in the Gap they was
[28:11] talking about predestination and things
[28:15] like that someone said some time ago
[28:18] said well if I believe a thing like that
[28:20] would I ever turn on the
[28:22] steam I'd paint the town
[28:25] red I'd go to Every d Hall I get so
[28:29] drunk and everything because why you're
[28:31] already secured in Christ what
[28:34] difference does it make now listen what
[28:37] he said the prophet I said that shows
[28:40] you haven't got it oh Hallelujah see if
[28:44] the love of God on ever struck your
[28:47] heart in the tenderness of Jesus Christ

[28:52] it to do this morning the love of God
[28:54] has strike our heart in the tenderness
[28:56] of Jesus
[28:58] Christ Hallelujah in the tenderness of
[29:01] Jesus Christ you would be so in love
[29:03] with him the world would be dead as your
[29:07] sin oh that's what I wanted to be this I
[29:10] want to be so in love with him this
[29:12] morning amen another statement I ain't
[29:14] got it written down here but I'll just
[29:16] paraphrase it brother Bram said on unite
[29:18] time and sign oh I love this one he said
[29:21] the church and so as in the church as we
[29:24] call ourselves the church the Bride As
[29:27] we call ourselves the bride and the
[29:29] bridegroom they're so unignited and
[29:31] coming together amen that there there's
[29:33] such a love amongst them that you don't
[29:35] have to beg people to
[29:38] pray you don't have to beg them to
[29:40] worship you don't have to beg them to do
[29:42] what's right they're so in love with him
[29:45] till there's nothing else oh God help us
[29:48] this morning to get it so in love with
[29:50] you this morning that there's nothing
[29:53] else oh my there's nothing else
[29:58] he said the world would be dead is your
[30:00] sin that's how you know you have the
[30:02] Holy Spirit not because you could
[30:05] scream shout we could do all those
[30:08] things speak uh uh tongues or whatever
[30:11] it is but when he be but when sin
[30:13] becomes dead and you're alive in Jesus
[30:16] Christ he said oh of God how rich how
[30:19] pure
[30:21] see still talking about the Christian
[30:24] experience amen see we all we all have
[30:27] trials each and every one of us have
[30:30] trials this
[30:31] morning if we'd go around the room we'd
[30:34] probably say oh I just
[30:36] been going through the greatest battle
[30:38] of my life go around the room and we
[30:40] find out see I said it like this before
[30:44] you're either in a trial or a battle
[30:46] either coming out of a battle or fixing
[30:48] to go into a battle that's right brother
[30:51] amen there's no there's no two three
[30:53] ways around it either in one coming out
[30:55] of one or fixing to go into one right
[30:57] and me and you all have
[30:59] trials what made I think brother uh uh
[31:02] Wade said this last night he said
[31:05] whatever like you talked about brother
[31:06] Ryan what may bother him may not bother
[31:09] me and what bothers me may not bother
[31:11] him and you may think my my that's so
[31:14] pilly Brother David hey that's so that's
[31:16] so childish but hey you just don't
[31:18] understand sometimes amen and and you
[31:22] don't know how people you know there let
[31:23] me just back up this ain't in my notes
[31:25] but hey there was one God one time that
[31:28] come to church where we used to go to
[31:29] church at years ago and and and nobody
[31:32] wanted to sit by him they thought he was
[31:35] kind of strange kind of different and he
[31:38] acted kind of different he acted kind of
[31:42] strange but I'm like Paul Harvey this is
[31:46] the rest of the
[31:49] story what made him act that way he was
[31:52] riding in the back of a pickup trying to
[31:54] hold down a
[31:55] mattress and the wind got up under that
[31:57] mattress and blew it out and him with it
[32:00] he hit his head on the pavement and
[32:01] that's why he acted that way so see and
[32:05] until you know the rest of the story
[32:07] sometimes that makes a whole lot of
[32:09] difference when you when you know the
[32:10] rest of the story amen so hey we
[32:14] sometimes we don't know why is that
[32:16] bothering her why is that bothering him
[32:18] but you might not know the rest of the
[32:19] story you might not know what they've
[32:21] been
[32:22] through oh but we all have trials we all
[32:26] have bad
[32:27] yes sir
[32:29] amen oh but it's just as true that we're
[32:33] delivered out of them all what of the
[32:35] Bible says many are the afflictions of
[32:37] the righteous but the Lord delivers out
[32:39] of them all amen we have
[32:43] Corruptions every one of us there's no
[32:46] good thing that dwth any of us amen we
[32:49] all have Corruptions and no this for a
[32:51] fact but it is true that we have an all
[32:54] sufficient
[32:55] savior amen man who overcomes those
[32:59] Corruptions amen if he's living in us we
[33:01] can overcome them and he enables us to
[33:05] put Satan under our foot amen amen he's
[33:08] enable me and you this morning to put
[33:10] the devil under our feet this morning
[33:15] amen thank God he's under our feet this
[33:20] morning amen we don't have to play
[33:22] second field to the devil amen we can
[33:25] tell him he's a liar to morning hey man
[33:28] you're a liar I'm Healed I'm delivered
[33:32] I'm an
[33:33] overcomer I'm a winner amen
[33:38] hallelujah it's wrong to deny still
[33:41] talking about the Christian experience
[33:44] it's wrong to deny that we've been
[33:46] through
[33:48] despondency what's that
[33:50] mean we feel like we're
[33:53] worthless feel like we're useless you
[33:56] don't have to raise your hand hands but
[33:58] I'm I wonder if I'm talking to someone
[33:59] this morning that feels like you've been
[34:01] through
[34:03] despondency feel like nobody
[34:05] cares oh but I'm telling you there's a
[34:08] God that cares this morning amen you've
[34:11] been through

[34:47] only one he'd have went to Calvary for
[34:50] you yeah

[34:57] been through
[34:58] despondency that crept along through the
[35:00] valley of
[35:01] humiliation a lot of us maybe has went
[35:03] through the valley of

[35:26] tell you that he'll see you through your
[35:28] despondency amen he'll see you through
[35:30] your battles he'll see you through your
[35:33] trials he'll see you through the valy of
[35:35] humiliation right we can say we've been
[35:38] through them but we've not remained in
[35:40] them we've not left our bones to be

[1:07:00] forgiven
[1:07:02] me Hallelujah let me read this to you
[1:07:05] brother say the Mighty God unveiled 1964
[1:07:08] we noticed another thing in the Old
[1:07:10] Testament said I have the scripture here
[1:07:12] in Exodus that the old Badger skins what
[1:07:14] did it do it hid the glory of God from
[1:07:17] the people the badger skins even people
[1:07:20] couldn't see it because it was a skin
[1:07:22] that held it the glory of God was behind
[1:07:25] the skin and now the glory of God is
[1:07:27] behind your
[1:07:30] skin that makes me want to shout amen
[1:07:34] the glory of God is behind your skin
[1:07:37] that's right he said and the Traditions
[1:07:39] don't see it it's inside the veil where
[1:07:42] his word is or was amen again the same
[1:07:45] message what's on the inside of that
[1:07:47] skin back there the old Badger skins
[1:07:50] which there was no Beauty we should
[1:07:51] desire it and when it was made flesh and
[1:07:54] dwelt Among Us it was still no Beauty we
[1:07:57] should desire it and now the same thing
[1:07:59] is today there's nothing in a manner
[1:08:02] woman that can be
[1:08:03] desired it's what's behind there that's
[1:08:07] what it is it's what's behind there well
[1:08:10] he said that fell I know he used to be a
[1:08:12] drunker he used to do this I don't care
[1:08:14] what he used to do what's hid behind
[1:08:17] that skin what is behind there what
[1:08:20] counts that's what the people is blinded
[1:08:22] that skin blinds people see all brother
[1:08:25] Wade used to do this sister June used to
[1:08:27] do this but what about
[1:08:31] now amen oh brother B said they want to
[1:08:34] talk about somebody well he he's a
[1:08:36] fanatic he went too far but what about
[1:08:38] those that didn't go far enough right I
[1:08:40] just want to stay right down the middle
[1:08:42] of the road amen hey what was he used to
[1:08:45] do yeah he used to but what is he
[1:08:49] now amen what is he now see he says it's
[1:08:54] the skins that blind he said that's what
[1:08:56] counts a skin that blinds me see they
[1:08:57] they I remember when that woman used to
[1:08:59] I know what she used to but what about
[1:09:01] now them skins that was once on the
[1:09:04] badger but now it's hiding the glory to
[1:09:05] God got it housed behind it it was on a
[1:09:08] animal but now it's housing the glory of
[1:09:10] God and so your skin be changed tonight
