========================================

shiny trip our [Music] [Music] [Music] around your power Oh Oh [Music] holy home [Music] [Music] a man it's gonna be in the house of the Lord again you ready to just worship the Lord tonight and I'll tell you what it's good to make up be a message believer tonight if anybody should know how to worship God it should be us right with all that's been poured out to us and all that's been shown to us tonight I want to look at 2nd Kings chapter 8 and just kind of look at a little a little story here tonight maybe just kind of help us in the middle of the week or maybe one day short of the middle of the week but anyway let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we get into the word Lord God we're so happy Lord Jesus to be able to serve you night and to be able to look into your word and see what your will is for us we pray God that you will open up the ears of the hearer Lord and open up my mouth to speak your truth Lord Jesus and we ask Lord that you will just feel welcome here tonight Lord that you would come and your spirit Lord would just move over the word just like the same way that you moved over the waters Lord before as the world was being formed Lord and just created an atmosphere of worship here Lord Jesus that we might be able to receive exactly what is neat needful for us now in this time Lord we thank you Lord Jesus for your word that you've given unto us Lord and we know that when your word has spoken it will not return void but it will produce what it was intended to produce we asked Lord Jesus tonight Lord God that our hearts would be willing Lord Jesus to receive your word or Lord and to accept the things that have been preached Lord Jesus granite Lord God that you'll Lord come and just quicken the word to us now we pray let's not just be it just to just just a normal gathering lord but lord gathering of the true worshipers that know the revelation and the purpose for the hour of that we're living in Lord to know your will for this hour we ask this thing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so tonight I want to preach on the will of God and maybe taking a little odd scripture from the from the Bible but it's you know the Old Testament especially that first and second Kings are so full of these little nuggets of stories that that I was reading this story to my to my family a few weeks ago and you know these little stories I believe really are like a proof that the message of the hour that we believe is true because after studying the message and all of these things you can go back into the Old Testament and see surfaced the things that we believe and hold dear we know that the message is true and the Bible is true because of how these things tie so perfectly together and how it's just interlaced and the things that we believe are not just some fable cunningly devised fables we believe are true so let's look at 2nd Kings chapter 8 verses 1 through 6 and maybe cops at your attention to you know maybe brother Matthew if he were here he would point out the number the numeric value of this this particular chapter number 8 if it is very striking that this story appears in second Kings vet chapter 8 and he says then speak Elisha unto the woman the woman is not named she's never named here whose son he had restored the life saying arise and go thou and thine household and sojourn where wheresoever thou canst sojourn for the Lord hath called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land 7 years and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of God and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines 7 years and it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines and she went forth to cry under the King for her house and forward land and the king talked with Ghazi the servant of the man of God saying tell me I pray thee all the great things that Elisha had done and it came to pass as he was telling the King how he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman who sun-hee had restored the life cried to the king for her house and forward land and kaha Zi said my lord o king this is the woman and this is her son whom Elijah restored the life and when the King asked the woman she told him so the King appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the fields since the day that she left the land even until now you might be seen may be seated the Lord blessed the word and and of course many of you here are already catching the revelation of what of what this is kind of hidden in this little story and you might wonder what brother Bob or how why did you take from this text there will a topic of the will of God why would you read this story and begin to talk about the will of God well I believe I believe in this hour that we're living in there are many people maybe maybe even tonight that are probing and searching for the will of God and their life and they don't know how to find it and they don't know what it is and they don't know I began it just kind of thinking about and meditating on this sermon I began to listen to a denominational preacher that preached a pretty good sermon on the will of God but you know I would even I would even pause it just this afternoon I would I would throw out that denominational churches do not know what the will of God is they can they know it to a certain extent or whatever but only the Bride of Christ only the bride and this day that has heard the message of the hour knows the will of God the purpose and plan to be able to sit here tonight and know what your purpose is and know why you're sitting here and have an understanding of what you're doing here and and what you've heard and know the will of God and you know that the will of God this little woman I believe she she had a she is a this little woman will I believe Titus the bride because she she was a woman that our desire was to seek after the will of God she wanted to be walking in the perfect will of God for her life she wanted to be her life to be lined up in the right way and you know a few chapters back if you go read where her story starts she she one day that prophet Elijah began to come through and she said she called ahold that this man was something something was different about this man and she told her husband who was getting a little bit older in years she said I I think that this is a man of God so she prepared a place she talked to her husband and to make it a little room in her house and you see when you recognize the word and you make a room and hear in your heart for the word and allow him to come and abide and you just like she made room in her house for the word to come then you'll receive what you're doing is you're lining yourself up with the will of God you're getting it at maybe maybe tonight I know many people have different kind of conceptions of what the will of God is and some people think it's like connecting dots if you can kind of go from one place to another but tonight maybe I was just kind of want to paint a picture of the will of God is like if you're being nestled under Inka eagle's wings if you're nestled safe and secure under the wings of God you are firmly in to the will of God and so she maybe had dots of her life going all different directions but yet she was her life she was she wanted the word of God you see she wanted she wanted what this prophet had to say she wanted a connection to God and so first of all in her life she recognized a man of God and she invited her him into her home and and what she did was she prepared a resting place for him so that when he was weary he didn't have a place to rest his head and and you know the whole and the whole story she never asked anything for herself it was all given to this man this man of God and so when he came and he told his servant this I want to do something for this woman I want to do something for it and and gauzy look what she doesn't have a child and she never asked for a child but but God God laid upon Elijah's heart to speak that word to her to give her a son to promise her a son that he would give give her this give her this promise you see and then the promised son died and and and yet she clung she clung to this desire to know the will of God why did my son die and so she went chasing after Elijah with that positive confession that we know so much about all as well she told her husband all as well as what she told Ghazi and if I'm pronouncing that name wrong you forgive me and I'm just trying to do the best I can with what I got and and she she went and she fell down that Elijah's feet and and she said I'm not gonna leave you until you come to my house and and Elijah went and and and see Elijah a circuit searching for the will of God also he's searching for the correct approach he paces back and forth he prays and he's doing all these things and finally he lays himself down on that child and and he his body began to go warm and he lays himself down mouth to mouth head to head fingers two fingers at brother Brennan said it was like taking a prayer cloth and putting it on a sick person but you see brother Brennan explained that that that created a channel because the Word of God was in that man so much that the spirit of the of the Living God could pass from him into that dead child and raised him to life you see that's that's walking in the word that's walking in the will of God if we could find the will of God for our lives if we could find the plan of God for our lives he'll raise us rate we'll see God raised out of history will see God move us out of our dead ideas and our our old ideas our carnality into a living reality of a living God I believe that's what the will of God is because you see we we need to know the will of God it's important to know the will of God you know there's maybe maybe you could say two different kinds two different ways of looking at the will of God in Psalm chapter 33 it talks about what what I'll say like their determinant to the will of God it just lays out a plan that there gonna be oh say say like this there is gonna be a bride there's gonna be seven church ages there's gonna be somebody in each church age to receive the word to believe the word there is gonna be these things it's that God has determined it he said it's going to be in psalms chapter 33 verses 4 to 11 it says for the word of the Lord is right and all his works are done in truth he loveth righteousness and judgment the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord by the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of him by the breath of his mouth in other words God spoke it and just it just it didn't matter whether or not you believe it or not God spoken and it came to pass he spoke it in the world was formed he just determined it he said it he said it and that's the way it is he gathered the waters of the sea together as and heat he layeth up the depth and storehouses and let all the earth fear the Lord let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him for he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood fast the Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen Denault he maketh the devices of the people of none effect the counsel of the Lord standard forever the thoughts of his heart to all generations in other words when God says that it's jun's it's going to happen now now at Curtin we want to get down to a more individual level because God God spoke it but yet there's there's there's things there's a an individual person a will of God for your life and and and that works a little bit in a different way because you can allow the will of God to take effect in your life and you can prevent it and and you see there's the will of God here that I want to talk about tonight and your self will as self will as opposed to the will of God what we want to do we want to let that self will die out and allow so that the will of God can take preeminence in our lives let me read another scripture before I kind of go on from from that line of thought and Daniel chapter 2 and this is one we quote so many times and yet it seems like we struggle with this we struggle with really accepting this Daniel answer that said be blessed be the name for of God forever and ever for wisdom and might are his and he changes the times and the seasons he removed with kings and setteth up Kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that no understanding another in other words that's God's deterministic will he just says I I'm gonna put in kingship whoever whoever I want to there's another scripture that I've forgotten right now that says that he he he convened the will the heart of the King whatever way he wants to he could make the King think this or think that because it's his will he's he's using as Martin Luther would say he's he's allowing the the government of the world to fulfill his law so that so that people are punished for doing wrong so that people are rewarded for doing good by putting in his deterministic will into the into the things of the world you say well well maybe what I want to get across tonight is it is a you know we think that we're influencing elections and things we think when we go to the poll and vote we're having this great big influence and everything but really God it's all up to God God put somebody in power so that his will can be fulfilled and you look at that who the President of the United States is and all these things and we worry so much about Republican or Democrat or whatever but yet the person that's in power is in power so that God's will can be fulfilled whether it's or not so that they can have a relationship with Israel and so that this can happen and that could happen and all these things it's so that God's will can be fulfilled and regardless of who's in power whether it's a Republican or whether it's a Democrat or whatever I might get in trouble for it but I'm not afraid of you tonight because you see it's all working according to God's plan and purpose it doesn't matter who's in power God is the one that put them in power it's God's deterministic wheel and you see but you see with you with your personal life his will works a little differently he's got it will for you he won't stings to happen in your life he wants you to be blessed he wants things to to take place but you are the one that prevents thing from happening you are the one that prevents God's blessings from happening in your life so there's two kind of ways of looking at will there's that global overarching view of will that God says there's gonna be seven church ages there's gonna be a bride but because there's going to be a bride doesn't necessarily mean that each individual in this church tonight is part of that it's up to you to be a part of that bride or not so if you pull up that definition of will in the Greek lexicon where the definition is what one wishes or has determined shall be done now you see God God is not he's not when we think of his will he's not surprised he's not surprised at who's gonna believe tonight he's not surprised he's got it all planned out he knows in advance who will believe and who will not he knows tonight who will be who will go from this church service and say well I didn't know I just slept the whole way through it I didn't really get anything from it he knows and every church service what what happened he knows he knows the complete plan of your life he knows the end from the beginning but he and all of that is part of his will because he's not surprised he knows what's going to happen and and if you're kind of getting into the spirit of the message tonight though the will of God let's be playing what I'm referring to the will of God is his word and his word is eternal and his word governs how things should be what will take place all of these different kind of things what what will the will for your life and God's will we think a lot of times when we're when we want to find the will of God that is somehow hidden that there's some kind of maybe something that we could we could maybe stumble over and stumble our way into the will of God or maybe we'll maybe we will cry and expect some lightning bolt to strike us or we don't realize I think how plain the will of God is if God is going to hold us responsible for the will of God that he will make it easy to find he will make it will make it away it will make a way for us to be able to get to it and so many times we in our minds we think that the will of God is some obscure thing that we can barely grab a hole to that that who knows the real will of God that maybe maybe some we almost spiritual eyes that so much so that maybe if we're maybe you know you going out of church and you stop at the gas station and you look and see what price the the gas that your pump it is and it might fall on a certain set of numbers and you well spiritual eyes that so much into maybe advising us on oh well I need to buy this house with this street number and I'm just kind of making making an example off-the-cuff but you see that's not how you find the will of God the will of God is very easy to find all you have to do is go home and open up the pages of your Bible and sit there in the quiet and and meditate upon the Word of God and the war and you will find the will of God the chart let's read John chapter 4 verses 31 to 34 and the meanwhile his disciples prayed him saying master II but he said to them I have meat to eat that you know not of therefore said it said the disciples one to another hath any man brought him all to eat jesus saith under then my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work and you think well well that was that was for Jesus in Matthew chapter 7 21 verse 21 it says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven so you see it's important to be able to do the will of the Lord how can you do the will of the Lord if you don't know what his will is it's very important to know what the will of the Lord is and and that's why I'm getting getting back to my point that hah you've got to be able to come to a church that can a communicate to you what the will of the Lord is the will of the Lord is a famine in the land for knowing what the will of the Lord is in Ephesians chapter 5 verses 15 and 17 you see then that you walk circumspectly not as fool's but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil for be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is you should understand what the will of the Lord is and and again what the will of the Lord is as his word how can you know what to do how can you know how to behave yourself in the congregation of the Lord how can you know everything but from church order to how who you should marry and how you should conduct yourself at work and what you should even aspire to and your Christian journey how can you even know what you're doing here without knowing what the will of the Lord is Matthew chapter 12 verse 48 to 50 says but he answered and said unto him that told him who is my mother and who are my brethren and he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples and said Behold my mother and brethren for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven the same is my brother and sister and mother so he disconnected from himself are all kind of natural relations all in any kind of there's no genealogy in this there's no no kind of natural familial thing what it is to be - what he's saying is if you'll do the will if you'll understand the word and then perform the word by by knowing what the word requires for you by by seeking after those things then the same as my brother and sister my mother that's the same with my family members if you want to be part of the family of God understand what his will is and meet the requirements of the wheel in Amos chapter 8 I got to hit this - because you see that the little woman Elijah sit the little woman away because there was a famine coming in the land she sent her away for seven years and Amos chapter chapter 8 verse 11 says behold the days come saith the Lord God that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread not a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord and I want to just point out that it's not a famine of the preaching of the word because the word is being preached the word is being preached all around the world of course there's false preachers and there's true preachers and everything but in between if you could say it like that there's all kinds of things being preached but yet the word is being preached and also we've got the word on an eleven hundred tapes that you can play in your car or whatever there is the word is available to you the will of God is available to you but you see there's a famine for the hearing of the word in the land because what happens is the people's eyes have become so close their eyes have become so covered and their ears are clogged up with their own self-will with the things that they've they think to be true that they cannot understand what the will of God is and so they're wandering about from in confusion wandering from church to church from place to place you know I'm riding on the subway to work you look around and you begin to think this whole the whole world is just wandering and confusion nobody knows what they're here for that's why people commit suicide and why they get depressed and all these things because they don't know the will and the purpose of God for their life they don't know what they're doing here for they think that it's just an endless vain journey that one day they'll fall into the grave and their whole life will be meaningless and and everything will just be black and there's nothing even beyond the grave they don't understand the purpose that we're living for but you see you are not ordained to live in confusion you are not ordained to wonder about without a plan and purpose of your life because you see God has a plan and purpose for every one sitting in here tonight if you can just find out what that plan and purpose is and the only way that you can find out what God's plan is for you tonight is to look into his will and look into his word and find out what God wants you to do you see so many people wonder about wondering if if church actually works how you're saved and wondering even if God loves you or not and I wanted that's one of the things I want to declare tonight that God's will is for you to understand that God's will is for you to know that God loves you that God has a purpose for you that you're just not on some vain journey listening to some vain fables some fables that some man cooked up we're not we haven't heard a message that originated from Jeffersonville we've heard a message that are originated from the throne of God on high we've we've heard a message that originated directly from glory and it's calling us back to glory so we're not wandering wandering a don't wonder tonight if you can be delivered if you can overcome tonight because God made a way for you to overcome the things of this world he's made a way for you to overcome yourself well he's made of waiting for you to deny yourself and to be a prisoner of the word because you see if you do not know his will then you are living in self-will you're living under the will of yourself or maybe under the will of others if you don't know the will of God you're just doing something because you've heard somebody else tell you to do it or somebody else is guiding you but if you have a personal revelation yourself of who Jesus Christ is and you know the word and you know the day in our living and you know what steps your life should take then you're living under his will you're living according to his will you see that's that's our great battle is the battle of self wheel versus his will and brother were never told us that we were we live in really three realms we live in these three modes we live in and in a realm of vision which you know I've never seen a vision and maybe most of most of us have never seen a vision but but there's another realm that you can live in the realm of Revelation and a revelation is when is when you know it to be true not somebody's not going to come along and say well I I maybe I can reason you out of believing that the message is true maybe I can tell you that that you know so many people did the count was off of how many people died and when the when the bridge was being built or some other nonsense like that but when you have a revelation because you understand the will of God nothing can move you from that the gates of Hell could not prevail against the revelation but then there's a third the third room the third move that we operate in almost all of the time and is that that is that humanistic real where we get tired we think when you know when you come to church and you get kind of you get sleepy or whatever that sleepy spirit will get on you and you begin to wonder maybe even wondering and within yourself within your mind what the preacher is preaching about and all those things you begin to wonder if the preacher is preaching on you it won't wanting to be treated differently it wanting to be treated nice or many sometimes even preachers they'll go to a particular church and they'll but get all upset within themselves why they don't get invited to preach and all that humanistic around wondering this and wondering that but if we can get out of that room and get into the realm of Revelation and the only way to do that to deny self will requires knowing and understanding the we love God that God's will is his word because I was I was just recently studying on the life of David and how he he's so put all of his trust in the will of God when when Samuel came and poured that anointing all over his head he knew that he was going to be king he knew that that was the will of God in his life and it didn't matter what Saul said or what Absalom said he walked in a perfect confidence it didn't even matter what David's own works were when he went with Bathsheba and did all these horrible things the will of God had already been spoken in his life and maybe that's another thing I want to communicate tonight is is God is able to - to overcome all of your faults and failings you know brother under said you'll never be an angel here or there but you are a human and God made you that way he made you in a way that that we would need a savior he made us in a way you're not we're we're not destined to walk around here like perfect like angels but God's work God already paid the price he paid the price when he died on the cross and it's not by your works that you'll be saved it buddies but it's by faith and they're overcoming power they overcome and work that Jesus already performed that will give us overcoming faith overcoming power in this day whether I'm said in in Revelation chapter 4 we're not just 61 he said yet Vail you know what that veil is that veil is your heart from it from will say from the will of God are you ready the veil is called self-will did you get that picture now the sense is out there the sense is on the body and the census to the soul and the veil between that in the holy place the holiest of holy and the only way that you can get in there is to have self will for whosoever what hosts whoever shakes hands whosoever is immersed whosoever joins the church whosoever passes his letter whosoever does what whosoever will come beyond the veil whosoever will come beyond that bale to to deny yourself well when you come to church and you hear things preached it that it just stumbles you into whatever go back to the Bible and look into the wheel of God's Word and hold it up to you like a mirror and say is it true or not and I believe that now is the hour we we should be concerned about what the wheel is maybe let me just stir up your remembrance turn you up a little bit to get real serious about the word because now the hour is growing late now is the time where people because they don't know the will of God had begun to fall off we're coming to a place where the church is holding up the bride is holding up and people are beginning to fall off because they're not steadying the word they don't know the will of God but that is not the so that is not so for you tonight because you you have been taught you have been instructed in the will of God you're not predestinated to just be wondering what's going on what's wondering what's happening you see brother ramen and in that perseverance he said and that Avenue is the same place that God said every man from Adam and Eve self will you will to live or you will to die either one you won't - is your based on free moral agency and whatever a spirit that you let dominate you will bring forth the fruits your life will be dominated by the inside you are the one that allows either the spirit of truth or the spirit of the world to dominate you you are the one that allows that and you allow it by what you feed on when you sit in your car and you listen to rap music you listen to the junk of the world and you listen to all these talk shows and all the soap operas and all that nonsense that is allowing that spirit of the world to dominate you it is allowing that thing that those things those influences to dominate your life and it will influence the way you talk and the way you act and the way you speak but if you allow the will of God the Word of God to dominate your life it will influence the way you act and the way you talk and the way you respond to others it will cause a change in your life it will give you overcoming power because this is not just this is not the words that of a man that we've heard we're not going just going to message school but this is the words of God that we are that we are hearing and the Word of God will not return to Him void the world of God will perform what it was sent to do brother Brennan the message thirst he said like Paul said describes in Romans chapter seven verse 21 when I would do good then evil is nigh when you try when you try ever have that in experienced Christians that when you're trying to do something that's worthwhile go to make an effort to do something that's good then you find out that there is the devil on every hand just to upset you everything and that's one good thing that I'd like to say this that the Christians might know that when you're when you're starting to do something and there is all something always trying to upset you and doing it do it anyhow that's the devil they're trying to keep you from doing it now many times I meet people that's prone to be a little nervous when they find out that they're trying to do something and everything just blocking it off on both sides they say it not might not been the will of the Lord see now don't let the devil lie to you like that the first thing is find out whether it's the will of God or not and then if you want to know whether it's the will of God here now here's the clincher of the whole thing if you want to find out whether it's the will of God or not look in the Bible look into the Bible now you dare you've got a quote it's not just brother Bob saying this listen if you want to find out if the person that you're talking to you is the right kind of a mate for your life look in the Bible if you want to find out if you're wearing the right kind of clothes look in the Bible if you want to find out whether the job that you're looking for is okay for you to work there because they work on Sunday and work on Wednesdays and all those kind of things look in the Bible if you want to find out how to raise your family look in the Bible and the Bible will tell you if you want to find out the will of God for your life look in the Bible if you want to find out the will of God for the whole bride of the age look in the Bible the Bible is the will of God if you want to if you want to find out how to live and how to do and look in the Bible and then if you want to know whether it's the will of God look into the Bible there is the thing that sets you straight is the Word of God and then if you see us in the Word of God for you to do it like for instance seeking for the baptism of the Holy Ghost many times I've run into people say well I have salt for the Holy Ghost and I just couldn't receive it I don't believe it's for me every time I get down I get sick and I go to praying if I fast I get sick and if I try to stay all night I stay up I get so sleepy I can't get off my feet remember that is the devil because God intends for you to have the holy spirit it's for who soever will many times you find when you're prayed in a meeting for divine healing then the next day you find out no doubt that the devil will make that twice as bad as it was the day before see remember that's just Satan trying to get you away from the blessing that God has got for you see don't you listen to that fellow see always press right on you what he's talking about here in this quote is when you're trying to obey the will of God when you find out what God wants you to do like get the Holy Ghost be born again then the devil is gonna attack you and he's gonna tell you it's not for you and all those kind of things but the the ammunition against the devil is the will of God which is the Word of God throw the will of God in the devil's face whenever he tries to tell you that that experience you had years ago it's not true that the thing that the things that God has shown you are not through throw throw that will of God back in his face face and that that will give you faith because as you confess the Word of God as you go through your life as you go through this journey God is molding your confession so that you'll say the right thing so that it gets hold down he's molding your confession so that you know exactly what to the do to the devil so that when the devil comes and says that I don't know about that I don't know if this message that's true I don't know if the Bible is true then you know how to attack him and I believe one thing that you can throw back in the devil's face when he comes and tells you that message is not true there's this story that I'm reading the night in 2nd Kings chapter 8 because there was a woman that after seven years she came out and everything was restored unto her and the same thing is happening to the bride after seven years traveling traveling around she's come back and she's crying to the king I know what I'm supposed to have everything is supposed to be restored to me because listen that woman knew the will of God that you're supposed to know the will of God you're supposed to know what you're doing here tonight you're supposed to have an understanding of what what what place in what position you have because God's will is his word that shooter might woman she believed for a child and it was raised from the dead and she trusted God to go down into the enemy's land to preserve her during the famine and she came out the other side she came out and she was because she was walking in the will of God God's will is her word and she back then and in her particular instance maybe she didn't have a loose-leaf Bible to page through but she had was the Word of God manifested a prophet that told her go here and do this and she clung to that prophets words she clung to his words and did exactly as she was bidden until the end of the story when she come out of that seven years that it came time for her to go into the land you see III I'm getting ahead of myself but see the shooter might woman was promised a child think about it think about another another woman in the Bible that was promised a child that was promised a child that was relying and trusting on the will of God and then got out of that will of God I'm speaking of Eve because you see Eve Eve wanted to know the will of God by getting ahead of God's program she wanted to know the will of God she was it was very mysterious how things were going to take place in her life the Bible says in Genesis chapter 1 verses 26 and 27 that that God had told them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it he told them what the will of God was for her life and so they had the will of God but she was wondering maybe what how it would be accomplished and and and day after day went by and she didn't see anything happening and then the devil came down and God and the Beast and began to plan some new ideas in her mind you see how slick the devil and shrewd that 'evil is and the devil is doing the same thing today people sitting in message churches and they began to think day by day that I don't see maybe anything happening not realizing how God's will is supposed to work in your life you don't want your pot for it to boil you don't go look at the seed and and say what every day you go to look at it again but you just keep plant that seed and planting good ground and just keep watering it and by-and-by it'll come up so Eve Eve got out from the womb from under the will of God by trying to cheat she tried to get ahead of God's program she began to lose trust lose confidence and Adam and her husband she began to lose trust I'll say in the ministry she began to think well maybe the ministry doesn't know what they're talking about maybe there's enough Avenue that I can go to get to get the the will of God in my life her purpose you see was to bring forth life by the spoken word but it had not been made manifest and not been made real to her yet and our purpose you see was to have total dominion over the earth let's go back and read Genesis 1:27 27 or 28 again God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed him and said to them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing over every living thing that moveth upon the earth Eva was predestinated to have dominion over the earth and you were predestinated not to cow down to the devil but they have authority over the devil not because of your own ideas of your own self will but because you know the will of God because the will of God is made manifest in you and you know how to react to the will to the to the lies of the devil your plan and purpose God has ordained you to be an authority to have complete dominion over the earth to have dominion over your flesh to have dominion over yourself wheel to have Dominion and authority over the little things that used to bother you the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and all these things God has raised you up to have dominion over these things this is what the bride has been called for and you see Eve was called to those things to have complete dominion over the earth but yet she was she was promised a child he see just like this shunammite woman was promised a child but she got out from under the will of God the will of you think about that what the will of God the will of God for Adam and Eve many of those things are the same thing for them for us we see the will of God for Adam was not to be alone the will of God for Adam was not to go through life alone and God doesn't want that for you and I you see he doesn't want us to just be alone as we go through life he wants you he wants you to come to church and go through this spiritual journey with other people he wants you to fellowship with other people even when Jesus sent the preachers out to go preach in the street he didn't send him alone he sent them two by two he said don't go alone but take somebody with you because he doesn't want you to be alone he wants to he wants you to have a helpmeet he wants you to have other brothers and sisters to fellowship with he wants you to have like in Proverbs where iron sharpens iron that where other brothers were always quoting here in church iron sharpens iron we sharpen one another and when you go off alone and you don't fellowship with other I believe that you in that part of the world of God you are outside of the will of God because you were not meant to be alone you are not meant to be isolated but you're supposed to be supposed to be part of something part of a great organism a great moving of God the Bride of Christ the will of God for Adam and Eve with to control nature and to fulfill the Word of God to see the Word of God fulfilled in their members the word the will of God for Adam and Eve was not for them to be constantly coughing and sick and and and dealing with all these health problems of things but the will of God was for them to be healthy and that's the will of God for you tonight if you can just believe that it the will of God is for you to be healed God wants you to be healed and he wants you to be well he doesn't want you to be suffering in depression with a big old dark cloud over you going around wondering if why you're so anxious and everything he doesn't want you to have anxiety because the Bible says to fear not taking no thought for the morrow he wants you to be to have peace and comfort and all those things he wants you to have joy unspeakable he wants you to to be able to to bring forth life and Adam and Eve they were predestined to bring forth life and the bride is bringing forth life also bother spoken word because she's predestined to do the greater works to speak the world of life into the heart of the unbeliever and they hear the word and they become a believer because when you hear the word you are hearing from your theophany you're hearing from the eternal and that bursts the eternal life and you you were predestinated that's the will of God for your life the will of God you see is who God is how to serve God how to live what you're doing here what you should be interested in who to marry whether you should go to church or not your place is a Christian of what God wants you to be all those things are wrapped up and we're and in the will of God everybody doing all right better gonna sit in one in the median let me give you a shocky something he said see not all that saith unto me Lord Lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of my father his will is his word we can be ever so religious have great time shouting jumping in these meetings which were I don't want to be critical but I have a duty to do to God and that Duty is to be sincere and to say what he wants me to say and I'm certainly grateful for the California chapter who was born with me and my convictions in other words he's saying it's great if you jump and shout in all those things and it's there's nothing wrong with that and many times when you catch a hold to the revelation of the of who you are and what God is doing for you that he can save you from your sins and all of those things you will jump and shout but but the main thing is do you do you know the will of God for your life have you caught the will of God have you caught the purpose and plan of God and his will is his word and the choosing of a bride brother Evan said the true Church of Christ the bride is so sold out to him and his promised word till the very mind that's in Christ is in you what a different and we find today that the modern church a modern world Church the modern world Church and also that the spiritual church are both pregnant to give birth to sons and we'll skip on down the the other is pregnant by the Word of God and in paragraph 170 and will bring forth a body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride that the body of Christ is and finished it and then skip keep skipping on down to the red now she the true bride so sold out to him that she used no mind of her own his mind of is his will and his will is his word so do you see what happens when you receive the word you are actually partaking in the mind of Christ and it is transforming your mind it is transforming your mind so that you understand his will so that you think like him so that you act like him so that he behave like him it is important to understand the will of God you see God's will God's will let's let's start out kind of basic for a second and work our way up God's will is for you to be saved and John chapter 3 it says as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up that whosoever believed in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish whosoever in other words this gets it's an open invitation to whosoever will the will of God is whoever will come can be saved and first Timothy 4 this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior who will have all men to be saved and to come under the knowledge of the truth think about that that God wants everybody to be saved who will have all men to be saved God wants every single person in here tonight to be saved the only thing that it's preventing that is your own self-will your own inability to open up the door of your heart and just to let him in it's not by your crying and praying and all these other things that's as simple as whosoever will believe whosoever will accept the Word of God for your day whosoever will just believe it will be saved and the invitation is open you see you see that's that's kind of starting from the basic in but but now we're going to get up to the will of God for this day in Romans chapter 8 verse 26 when you see that God's will God's will for the bride in this day is to be conformed to the image of his son the will of God and that's what I was alluding to earlier and maybe I'm wrong I'll take correction but I I don't believe that the denominational world understands this part of the word of God they do not understand that the will of God in this day is for the life of God to be made manifest in a bride for him to reveal himself into a bride until she becomes the Living Word made manifest the walking word so much that it is actually God made manifest in a people walking and living doing the same works acting the same way thinking the same way obeying the word just like Jesus did in Romans chapter 8 verse 26 to 31 it says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and what's it groaning for listen listen to this and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God in other words a calling to the Word of God and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose because they are walking in the will of God and it doesn't matter that this is what confuses people many times as you see Peter hanging upside down on the cross and you'll say well he must have been outside of the will of God you'll see Jesus died on the cross and you'll say well he must have been outside of the will of God but they were walking absolutely in the perfect will of God walking in the will of God does not mean that it will be a flowery bed of roses sometimes that will be persecution and hard times and died on the crosses and dying out to yourself will and struggling through life and all those things but when you're walking in the will of God you're walking into plan and purpose that God has for you and and think about think about the grace that God has shown us in this hour to be able to make manifest His Word in our lives to fulfill his word and to have confidence then when we leave this world we're going to a place where we will abide and rest eternally and you can have that too because that's an open invitation whosoever will let him come and rent the Book of Revelations the spirit and the bride both say the Botes say come whosoever come will come the the invitation is open all you have to do is believe let's see God's will is for you to be saved God's will is for you to make manifest his word that God's will is for you to overcome the the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost was not given for you to just be able to cower down to the devil and just to let him run all over you but it was given for you to overcome the flood the flesh the lust of the flesh and all of those different things because you see you weren't predestinated to conform to the world you were predestinated - you are not predestinated to be under the power well we're just saying openly you will not be under for less than to be under the power of pornography to sit there and have that spirit over you and there's a sit in front of the computer and look at the lust of the flesh and sit and be be under the power of the Dominion of that you are not predestinated to be under the power of cigars and smoking and all that kind of stuff you are not predestinated to be that to be under that power the influence of that other things of this world under the influence of the worldwide web where you get sucked in that web that it's nares so many people into that under all that stuff under all that condemnation that just eating on that what feeding on that will cause your life to degrade in under the influence of the world and you were not called to be under the influence of drug addiction you were not called to set aside a little money every month for you for your marijuana addiction settle down a little money every month so you could go and and fulfill all of those lusts of the flesh and things like that you are not predestinated to be to be under the influence of the worldly Dominion to be under the power of of enmity and hatred and anxiety and depression and complexes to be under the power of a loveless marriage or godless home to be under the power of all the sin but God has given you the power to overcome and the power to overcome is too too loose to deny your own will and open up your heart to the will of God which is his word you cannot you cannot overcome your self wheel and the things of this world any other way but by eating on the world of eating on the Tree of Life eating on that wheel of God you cannot overcome by your own works by your own struggling and striving the only way that you can overcome is by the Word of God you will eat your way to overcoming your eating we're eating our way to overcoming the things of this world I think so many times it's so difficult for us to accept that that you are not saved when we come to church so many people in this message today think that the message is full of legalism and the rules and thing rules about how to dress and rules about how to behave and we can't do this we can't drink alcohol we can't go to the movies we can't do the all those things that's not what the message is about and I will say out to you on the internet that's not with a message about whoever is listening the message about R is about receiving the Word of God so that God can change you from the inside and that will cause a transformation in your life and you will know then by knowing the will of God for your life how to act and how to dress and it won't be you thinking on how you should act and then doing that but it will be an automatic process an automatic process when somebody slaps you in the face and an automatic response that you don't turn around and slap them back because the transformation has been from the inside out not from the outside in we're not serving a God that requires us to work and to do all these things and the labor in our self and to push a penny with our nose like the Catholics and to do all these all these things to do all these works this is a worthless religion that we believe it is not us doing work but it is God performing the work in us it's God doing the work not us doing the work he is performing the work he is the one that justified us he is the one that sanctified us he's the one that filled us with the Holy Ghost and we had nothing to do in it at all except for opening the door of our heart and see come me and I'll accept you it is not us doing it it is not my works that we are saved it is not our works that justifies our flesh is not justified by our works that's carnality to think that there's anything good that we can do in ourselves to think that there's anything good that we can do at all that would save us we needed a savior to come and die on the cross for us we needed a redeemer to come and die to pay the price and that price paid the price come that when that price was paying it paid it completely there is nothing else that you have to do all you have to do is believe that he paid the price he paid the price and then he gives you the token that the price has been paid and all you have to do is say I know I believe that the price has been paid the price has been paid and that token gives you the right to get on the train to get on the flight home it gives you the right to get back to get on the end and the channel of God's will for your life there is nothing else required that the other than that you believe it but God believing it will give you overcoming power it will give you power to overcome the flesh it will you give you power to overcome your spirit it will give you power and that's why when you get amongst believers you'll see believers acting different than the world behaving different from the world and you might be confused to look on that like they have a set of rules they have to do it that way but it's not a set of rules that sort of law what God has written his word on the tables of your heart and you automatically act that way you automatically behave that way because God is on the inside that's when you know it's real is when you're not putting on when you're not showing off you're not trying to impress nobody but you're just being genuine I like people to be genuine if you have a temper just be genuine if you have a little if you have a little railroad rage you never now just be genuine and when God overtakes that road rage one day then it'll be a genuine overcoming and everybody know that it's been God that overcame in you and it's not something that you just worked up in yourself but God conquered that thing in you I believe in being genuine not just hypocritical but being a real genuine be a real genuine unbeliever if you're gonna be a real genuine unbeliever and then when you're a believer you can be a real genuine believer be a real genuine thing whatever you are brother Graham said there's a part of me in church age she said the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word and his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord within the word is quickened by the Spirit and it comes to pass but you think about how if you know the will of God and you speak it by faith knowing and understanding the will of God it will come to pass the spoken word was the original seed and the spoken word of God has to come to pass and when you speak about faith it has to come to pass but I'm sitting like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose and he continues on those in the bride do only his will think about that the bride does only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord or that keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works it's not you doing the works but that should make everybody just shout even if you're just on the inside it's not you doing the works it's God on the Sode performing his will in you he is the one doing his works he said fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride he's performing his works in you to fulfill his will by revealing his will to you let's keep reading this story in second Kings chapter 8 verse 3 it says and it came to pass at the seven years in that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines and she went forth to cry unto the King for her house for her land so now she's coming out after seven years she's coming out she's coming out and she knows now what she's here for she's got to see the land that she was given that she left when she went into the land of the Philistines is hers by right because it was given to her family by Joshua when they came over the Red Sea that is her family's inheritance it belongs to her and now she knows what rights she has that land is the land worth that Bette bore fruit for her family that land that land in this land to you this land to you is the promise of overcoming power it's the promise of the seals being open to you it's the promise of a revelation of the body change how to take a body change and you have a right to this if you know the will of God you have a right to this because God has given it to you not because of anything that you have done because of what he has done and he's giving it to you and it's your right and you can claim it you can claim it by looking into the word and seeing what God has given it to given unto you but you see it's got to be by revelation there's so many times we'll say well we can read in the word when it says thus and thus and such and such but that when the word is revealed to you reveals to you not only the word not only the true meaning but what to do with it that's why the preaching of the word is not just sticking up behind the pulpit and say the word but the preaching of the word is how to swing the sword you know you think about it somebody were to come into a church and and just be new and not understand things you wouldn't want to just chop their head off if somebody's coming into a church with depression and anxiety you wouldn't want to just heat more coals of fire on the head but you would want to swing that sword with wisdom and the same thing and every believers life when God gives you a revelation of his word he's not just giving you the correct interpretation but he's giving you knowledge and wisdom of how what to do with it went it like brother Branham when he was speaking and those people does that couple was out there kissing and doing all those things and they artists he had wisdom and knowledge of the correct thing to do when the word not just to swing that sword and lock their heads off but but to forgive because God had given him wisdom of what to do with the word we've got the word but do we have a revelation of the word and I believe that's what we should be crying out for and seeking a revelation of the word how do you get a revelation of the word the revelation of the word comes by the word because what the word on top of the word well it will water itself it will bring forth the word you see and I've got all these all these stories of y'all starting to get sleepy on me hang in there now we're in the homestretch at first Kings chapter 22 there's a story of the king of Israel when he said they went down and the king of Israel said unto his servants are y'all all right in the back y'all lose me first Kings chapter 22 verse 3 all right first scheme chapter 22 verse 3 tells a story over the king of Israel these two kings they knew that the land and ramoth-gilead was theirs but they went to go get it without without a revelation of how they should go get it you see the revelant that the land was theirs it was a biblical promise that the land was theirs but they they didn't do it by a revelation when it says in the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah said he's on his throne having put on their robes and the story goes that said Zedekiah the son of Qin tena Ana made him horns of iron and he said thus saith the Lord with these shalt thou push-push the Syrians until I have consumed them he was a he was a preacher preaching the literal that the literal text off of the page the word it was actually scriptural what he was saying that ramoth-gilead was theirs it was it was their land but they didn't do they didn't go get it by revelation because there was a little prophet that came on the scene and he said Micah I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills a sheep that have not a shepherd and the Lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace you see you see what I'm getting at tonight is that we must have a revelation of the word to know the will of God for our day understanding understanding that that you look at Matthew 28:19 where Jesus said that baptize in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost and you you can read that where they just taking the letters off of the page but the letters will kill you but when you when you understand it with a revelation with it when God speaks to you and opens up the true meaning of that how the correct way to be baptized the correct approach to God the correct the correct his correct will then you can come to him in the right way you must have a revelation for your own self so many times we rely on the revelation of our momma and daddy to tell us to tell us who we should get married to let's say it like that to tell us where we should live and what church we should go to but you've got to have a revelation for yourself and all these young people in this church one day you're going to come to a place where you're going to have to make a decision what kind of a church you go to you're gonna make a decision whether or not you sit at home in this stream in or sit at home and listen to tapes or whether you actually go to a church that has a pastor you're gonna have to make a decision and it's gonna have to be based upon your personal revelation it can't be based upon your mom and daddys revelation we'll read another story in the Bible of a at first King this is another one in Kings first Kings chapter 13 there was an old prophet in Bethel and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God another prophet had done and in which the death of the words which he had spoken unto the king we've got two prophets here and and one prophet went to do the word of the Lord and God told him don't deviate to the right of the left and this old prophet old revered prophet came and told him come on over to my house and we'll sit and fellowship for a little bit and he said well God the first prophet said well God told me not to deviate to the right or to the left and the old prophet who had been around for a while and she knows some things or not the Bible says he lied the Bible says he said that God told me to tell you to come over to my house you see you see that same thing as kid being carried out today where were people people rely so much on what other people tell them to do what other people tell them where they should go to church and all these things that they don't trust in God for a personal revelation of their own because that first prophet listen to the live the other prophet he died the lion jumped out and killed him you see but don't get tired on me now this is this is important you've got to have your own revelation of the Word of God you've got to have a personal revelation when you it's not enough just to know the letter of the word because the letter killeth but when you have a revelation when you have a personal revelation of what kind of person God wants you to marry you could knit you know you can have that you can have a personal revelation of what kind of job well God wants you to have God can reveal to you where he wants you to work but that's got to be your personal revelation and don't work if your mama and daddy are constantly guiding you they don't work if you're constantly having to go to somebody else to instruct you and wearing what you should do and what path you should take but when God reveals reveals to you the way that that God can save you but when he reveals you to you that he can feel you with the Holy Ghost when he reveals to you that he can feel you with all these virtues when he reveals you to you he can make manifest in your life the capstone when he reveals to you all those things that's not something that somebody else told you but it's something that God has personally revealed to you and when it's revealed it will come to pass that's one thing I think so many in the message are kind of that getting weary with it they're wondering if the word will actually produce something and then we'll go back to what I ought what I originally said the reason the word is not effective in your life is because of your self wheel self will will prevent the word for coming to pass and being made manifest in your life but when you allow the word to take effect in your life when you shun all these worldly influences when you don't eat from off of that tree of knowledge of good and evil and you begin to eat from the tree of life then it will produce the word in your life it will make itself manifest and let's keep going through this story I'm trying to I'm trying to come to a stopping point I see everybody get kind of tired and you know when you get tired that's when it get it gets real good don't don't don't listen to the devil the devil try to get that sleepy spirit on you and just just ruin your blessing and second Kings chapter 8 verses 4 to 6 we'll just keep reading known and the King talked with gauzy the servant of the man of God saying tell me I pray thee all the great things that Elisha hath done alright we got it tell me all these great things that Elisha had done and while he's talking well God jaha's is testifying to the king here comes the woman and it came to pass as he was telling the King how he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he had restored the life cried to the King for her house and for her land and God he said my lord o king this is the woman and this is her son whom Elijah restored to life and when the King asked the woman she told him so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the fields since the day that she left the land even until now you see this woman as Gahan was testifying of what had happened that this woman had had a son promised to her and this son had been raised from the dead and now this woman actually comes before the king and she has the evidence that the promised son has risen at her myths and I want to say tonight that the bride has the evidence that Jesus Christ is risen from the dead that he is walking in her mist in the midst of the church he is fulfilling and performing the same acts he's acting the same way that he did when he walked on the shores of Galilee and here's the evidence just like this this son his son was not walking with this woman it was not just a little baby anymore but he had grown up into the full stature he was walking there in his fullness and she came and she said this this is the son I have the evidence that he is risen from the dead and that's what the whole world is looking for today the evidence that the that the promised son is risen from the dead and the bride is the one that has that evidence because the bride knows the will of God and the will of God was for all that she had lost all that she had lost to be restored you see we're not living in an age of where God God nobody that's taken back now God is not taken back but this is an age of restoration where everything that we have lost has been given back this is a there is a ministry on earth preaching to a people that cannot fail that you cannot fail because you're living in an age where God everything that the windows of heaven have been opened up and all the world has been restored so that you could know the word for your day listen to promise that the promise of the word is that in Revelation chapter 11 verse 15 the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever what that means is that God is overcoming everything you're probably the promise that the bride has is that all of the world all of these things are you have power to overcome in you yeah that's what you were you were not predestinated to live under the power of sin or to get joy out of things of this world but you are predestinated and promised to overcome you see and words the word has an effect you know even in our in our humanistic realm when you speak words when you speak words to one another at work it creates an atmosphere when you sit in church and you know when the word begins to get priest real real hard and it'll create like almost a settled atmosphere where everybody kind of gets tensed up a little bit because words will create an atmosphere words will have an effect the Word of God is having an effect in your life it's causing something to take place the word is creating an atmosphere and we have not heard just the words of a man but the word spoken is creating an atmosphere in our lives just like the word spoken in the Genesis created an atmosphere for an overcoming man and woman to walk in and live in it created an atmosphere and the words that are spoken the night I believe are creating an atmosphere is faith because whenever the Word of God is spoken it will cause the people to catch a hold and to realize the the will of God to be able to look into the Word of God his word will produce words can sting and cut and and harm and all those things but you see or any kind of relationship has found that old words any kind of a relationship between a man and a woman is is based on words not so much feeling it might start on feelings and emotion and all those kind of things and I'll say that's maybe where Pentecost failed is because they got so caught up in the emotion that they failed to continue on to the words that are being spoken but we're now not under and and a dispensation so much of emotion and feeling and everything but now we're coming into a true relationship truth fellowship with God which is based on words words will have an effect and the Word of God falling into your soul will have an effect on your life it will produce the only thing that's keeping it from producing is the ground that's that parable that Jesus told in Matthew chapter 13 this some seeds fell by the wayside some fell upon stony places some fell among thorns but and all those things prevented the word from producing but if it falls into good ground if it fall if the Word of God falls into a ground where that where you were willing to die out to yourself where you're willing to search out the word where you're willing to find out whether these things are true or not it will produce you see you're actually a creator when you speak the words of God you're we're in training ground to be creators because God is teaching us how to speak the word and when you speak the word it creates an atmosphere and it will produce whether I'm sitting looking at the unseen when a man once catches that vision of the invisible God and know that he's always prison there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions and in the time of distress and trouble it'll still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the unseen yet by promise now how Abraham not only did he see the unseen and the reason he believed it was because God said it and if we being dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed and if the spirit that was in Christ dwells in us it does the same thing it does the same thing I'm a close on that while I just kind of finish every other musicians can come forward you see the reason the reason why we are Abraham's seed is because we know that if God said it we'll just believe the reason he believed it was because God said it if God said it then that that that is God's Word that is his will his will is his word so maybe I'll leave you tonight with a question what kind of heart do you have a heart to believe God's Word a heart just to accept it to accept the Word of God to open up your heart to accept the will of God the reason he believed it was because God said it if God said you can be healed you can be healed if God said you can receive the Holy Ghost you can receive it if God sent it you can believe it the reason he believed it was because God said because let's stand to our feet you love the Lord tonight I believe a revelation of God's Word gives us something to worship with a real believer should be able to
