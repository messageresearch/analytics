========================================

from you for a moment we know what the characteristics of the 4c is this the Eagle are prophetic anointing of the holy oak right the horse with the pale horse which was mixed it's a mixed color and we understand that the underlying meaning to that is is that it takes justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost mix together to bring the Word of God not just the Word of God in letter but the Word of God in power demonstration right the left side the Word of God lays everything we need we don't need anything else except the Word of God now it does take that eagle anointing to that's this is where I read between the lines right we have to be able to read between what it has to be like that onion field where you can where you can roll it back that's the same onion it looks just like the other layer but there is a difference in the layers I counted that treason they cut down 15 it's either 66 to 70 years old I counted the Rings oh there's a tree felling down in yards oh I have another one cut down and I have arranged a three things like better and more progressed but where was this around well this was a sycamore holler so yes and I'll stop came up about this high low so where he came from i sat down and counted rings me then he was putting wood up while he went and dump the wood out in the truck or in the tractor oxygen counted around a point 66 and 70 so that tree is almost the same ages today it started so I have 70 years old and that that what I'm telling you about that is let's see it takes that what it takes to reveal the age of that tree you can't do brain then and you honestly you gotta look then think some of them are just all bone touchable that'd be your to drive mm-hmm that was a year that was not much training buddy they will sound it was a or of inch and that was the year of growth a lot of rainwater growth and so the rain for this far apart but so many you see like two years in a row they were real close and then you see one big long gap well did I tell the history that's an underlying meaning of that tree that was been in the arts and we were children's friends able to steal them the Bible was written for the foundation of the world we know one thing for here and has not played itself out yet but it is the eternal Word of God because when we come down here into the permissive will die all we're doing is is we're taking this written word back to because remember Adam in the Garden of Eden didn't have a Bible he didn't need one he had the communication with God we'll talk about a little bit this afternoon here the communication with God that was so perfect that that if Adam said when stopped tree moon the nest that was nothing contrary to what God would see so I got that I had before the fall had complete control named all the animals and God never one time sending us no hold on a minute I don't think that's right no he had complete control right and then but we see though that he sold all that out for his wife and in fact where we are now worth this I will fall so God I think about it this morning it's not that God had to write the word he did have to write it because he knew we thought he wrote the word knowing with Paul he had this whole plan in his mind he knew we would bother and what we would need to get back in fellowship with one thing and that's so 66 books in that bottle that's the only way we can get back with God the only one all right now my god that and then with the 66 books of the Bible we are so fortunate to have all the commentaries of people passed and then we had gone bring a prophetic prophet here to fill in all the lights readjust the word yes I said read does not readjust the perfect part of the word but readjust the part that man had looked at everybody got that right he had to readjust that what bring us back to the faith of the fathers I thinking of them you take the magic stand up and if I were today go over to not to this church made you but go to a Baptist Church in and start preaching to them tell them say you know your father son Holy Ghost doctrine comfortably fit to hell mmm now how would that go but that's one program that he was preaching not to judge his people only right in the you know all denominational world what about a mass that will be he took he could say that because he what he he was a profane he could pray that Billy Graham would ever say that with his heart system all Robinson ever say that his court system now listen that not a sister that come from the pit the hell the doctrine did you hear he the doctrine did now there was many people baptized name called uncle don't go rewarding it right so you can't you got it ain't say well they were my best I was going to no no no they shifted that came from that doctrine came up out of hell what the devil the devil's when he brought that doctrine it wasn't not remember the number two spirit so the little is God in the devil so the devil got into people twisted the word and you know God didn't you know what a crisis to him he wrote everything in this word to leave us back to what the original foundation and then we'll talk about this afternoon because I believe that went it Adam has the book of the names of the redeemed right you have the book you have the intelligence to do it he had God's mind to be able to do to do that but the property God said that that was clouded our blackened or there was a cloud went over Adam so he couldn't remember everything this way why he took the ability for Adam to listen let's be real honest with each other from different growing experience with each other I see now I see now by the new birth I see now that I always was eternal back before foundation or I was in the mind of God I had to see him thought I was diseased I never was not a seizure like but remember that's what part that went away from Adam that's the part that went away from laughs okay and the advantage that well that got real man has been trying to bring us back to that listen that's what we're going back to the raft to the even life condition right so who was any I mean it wasn't even Adam and Eve the bride and the grid and this bride is going to have the same mind Instagram just like Eve and stay in line of the battle until what happened in the garden so now I can see my part of me has been enlightened you read the Bible talking about being enlightened we've been enlightened we've been the light that shone back to pass Genesis to tell us that that Justin's 1:26 manager I came from but it had to catch me down here because the Falls that rated okay and I was lost but in God's mind I never was because if he ever holds one thing against you and I was reading this morning we're brother Brown said if your name's not in the book you're never going to get so if your name was never any book you're never going to get me so Micah Pharisees he said their name was not the book do they conversation know if it's in a book but I'm going to the Brian section their name where you never in that book that part now and I got something many for later over brother Brown remember he said one time he said either when you come to sanctification he says your name goes on the book of the believer right I love your name was always written it it is written in eternal session but for a judgment purposes God had to allow that step to happen for here for here you go allow that where you can see that progress is your name is transferred now that's not angels up there transferring your name to me it's it's just symbolism it shows me that that everybody in the world has an opportunity to be say their name goes on the book as a believer exacta fication Jesus's name went on the book as a believer but he never went on to transfer that name to what the Lamb's Book of Life the one that God came to redeem but unless don't go so far because remember the lamb remains a foolish virgin who's not in Helen that's great people that's what we're coming up to in the fifth seal we're coming up to the grace that God had that goes way my my judgment your good yes because we saw it last look life that's all it is we're the bride we're in we're done no no if they had not done fall that's the way it would have been okay but now that the fall happened we see the full attribute of God come out that he can say whoever he will and their names can be transferred to a place wife upholding their and but that book of because remember when you come to judgment if we know there's not gonna be a book okay we know that but to for symbolism purposes that you get the people that are locked up you're going to flip the book open remember our names are not in that book our names are not in that revelation 20 or 21 book but remember cuz we're doing a judge and why would we do any judging if we have a name in a judgement book in a bull of life our name is not only a man but some people's names are on there that God knew wouldn't go all the way to receiving your birth but they're still going to be judged with their deeds now that's where you got judgment for those people couple under my name Buddhist virgin ones that we're blinded and get to that later but I'm trying to give you something to look we and I do I try to sometimes make it so much to where look it's just is the bride and nobody else will guess what that is true to a point because I don't have another bride I got one and I think about her I don't think about nobody else's bride I think about my right right right so God have this brought out on his mind and he is they are going to be so close to him so they'll be one just like out of an evil one now didn't have another vision of another woman he was a nice wine that's when shoulders out he don't want nothing to happen to and then he won't have to have need and it was another less thing or a thorough sex I did love that it was it was really the mind of God still acting as the Savior but remember he could only save her two so far he really couldn't save her at all but he was what covering her what Christ are you not he covered us while we were in sin he kept us because he knew we would come to a place a Redemption yet I believe 100 percent if you're born again you were given an angle that stayed with you from your birth to your new birth and continued on with you but definitely stake the glove if you supposed to come to here think about predestination now this is the freezer meaning of God there's nothing going to happen to you until you get to that point like I've always said about David David and like the part of people don't understand about David in life David believe that what Samuel said you will be kings of Israel he puts that down in his soul so deep I don't think he was arrogant because remember the Bible says that David was the apple of God's eye same way we're brother Brown my new you you know one thing for sure if God would give all that to someone else it went straight to their head but was way around he knew it was known as head he knew he'd be humble even though he was revealed the seven seals that were closed up before the foundation of the world God revealed them to a prophet and he still never got to be I'm not saying it didn't step out of line sure he made a mistake he said he did right right and then because he leaned toward that gift a lot he said angel don't you quit explaining again just use it in other words why you need to explain it but he was so he was so human till he wanted to by the sea he want people to see it he won't be able to see him he won't be able to see the Glide that was working through Trot the same way look with talk to Adam and Eve because we got to go back if this Adam and Eve in the garden then once it got to be what you got it was instead a return back to you because remember redemption is not replacement we fell from what the position they held right so we got to go back to that same tradition amen and we could see that Jesus showed some of it when he calmed the seeds in the water and all that we saw him brother Gregory calm storm and do plane like that but that the manifested sort of God that's something that God wants us to be complete control of the earth again and I believe we will be right I believe we will be will will rule and reign with him out of that city for an eternity now that's the bright part that's the part that is so special that the bright part but now see then we would take that box and everybody else's do but no there's going to be 10,000 little people outside the city than they are inside the city they just won't be able to come in the city and reside they will come into the city the Bible says and Keynes so there must be some kind of system there's good Kings there's Kings out there that's going to come in the Bible said take a leaf off symbolism it's symbolism taking the leap off the tree I'm going to make these but it's going to show that everything's piece was just showing that Joel everybody hey this is God in his bride and we have been blessed with great so much to wait to live here for an eternity no so see how the expanding of God it would be it would be a really narrow God if we just stayed the garden without money and the bribes that'd be just about it you know that would be too narrow no look once I start I was thinking last night look what he's allowed billions of people come serve billions there's seven billion now so many hundred thousand are dying sowing our thousand for being born so there's a rotation of you know there's probably 50 or 80 billion people that's build here since the beginning of town look at all that they got to go somewhere right this is it they got to go somewhere and I can't just be but I was talking to oh I come to Anderson and Emma they're cutting the grass 30 and Friday there's people born on this earth this just hearing skin that's all they are they're going to be judged and their soul just going to die don't even though they even though they what we say burn in hell is not eternal one day people on this earth are just gonna vanish they came here because of what for what happened to Adam and Eve it put that other covenant I was thinking of the day I went to the end of school and a little boy there that was a little bit retarding you know I mean it's faced with a little bit distorted and I felt God that's our Father that is not your fault that's man's fault the genetics of this one genetics of this one hey take a proper road browser that came from the grandparents epilepsia all this genetic coming down to mating Brenda centuries has produced all this junk sell the other stuff there's no we call mom boy but down center is known that in heaven there's none of that in God's mind there's none of that man produced that right man is what produced that man is black the the male DNA and the female DNA of what come to this earth has caused all this one because they came from atoms I read it last night in the reading inside the atom see kalinda beer atoms natural normal seed is what the wind is this earth imagine there was nothing right just about Adams natural seed so they caused death it caused death I don't care who you are I don't matter me who you had called death it did not talk like the only seed that ever caused life cause life is the spoken word when Jesus hit the earth and start speaking for three to five years and all this Bible was written because that's what brings life the spoken word program that is the original seed okay we're talking about a man this seed but he was all of the earth and it wasn't until he becomes deluded that all of this stuff started coming down so where does happen had to do a pickup he went into the full moon they took yeah he / to cook what she gave him our offer handful okay seeing that and he said well that's horrible out could have just said if it was if animal someone's God he just say food give me another one guy but you couldn't need to killing itself yeah you'd be killing itself that's why I'm just talking this is what I'm talking about now if Christ had become the bride will deny the bride would have died it he didn't come down here now what about a guard to die are gonna die yes didn't happen never in his whole psyche is he there right but he had to enter enter death just like that update don't you think Jesus now know Jesus didn't know who he was until he came up to her let's don't get let's do your thing close to the end of his life he knew he was going to have to die right now he have to get after these are not he could have turned all that around but now eventually that body would have died but he died willingly for you that's the same thing will Adam now Adam didn't die that day because remember the bosses the day you eat thereof so Adam lived 950 some years he almost lives long live with it we leave no humping some years why did not live that day that we're looking at the thousand-year millennium that we're looking at he they lived that day he died he was under death but look where he came from though men to live nine hundred some years did you imagine nine hundred years back there was basically maybe a little bit of China no other country was developed nine hundred years ago I mean you go down here you go thousand years back so this is 2017 you go to what 101 seven you'd be in the human forward at the dark ages yeah and you still be alive up there you see what brother brother I grasped at one time he said God knows you shouldn't live that long he said look at the strain you'd be under look at the difference you see from from right up from right here to here yeah all right so I why I said okay other years you're going to be about somewhere in there you know 120 then down to 70 ma'am living a little bit longer now but see this is to me the essence of the seal shows us all of our life it shows you why things happen even the horrible you come in here having to endure through death and through life and through losing loved ones and gang in London and money and going you all that but this some point to do bills carrier yeah it feels your cat comes remember we're gonna talk about Saturday I able to in came with two different people there was two different spirits no I think spirits my soul now the house all right man has salt man God salt alright but what does what happened will read what brother Brown fit them to spirits because remember that's what's the name of it so it's gonna be just after noon go to spirit started in the garden you can't rooo came enabled what happening it was Cain and Abel and then oh well the property I don't have to say you have to agree with me you but you disagree within those two spirit started there and they go all the way he said to Jesus returned all the ways of Jesus return need content for and got supposed to cut a tree down it grandma now tomorrow in a basil three huh that's why I told him I did you guys get a name for your free cutter April ground solo but the two spirits go all the way down start the agendas all the way down we run around when I was going to read this epidemic we get to it remember Turk a bookie said what when the brackets of Revelation of the two spirits in the framework of church you be an invincible army that's a problem those two seats are so close together or few spirits are so close together now to the law most deceive us sitting here on combat sitting in your life and my life that gets kind of home done it pull put it out Norris can able ok but Jordan a man able to Samantha maintains if you want it but the seals to me though revealed from Genesis to revelations the sealed is the greatest revelation yet it's the most simple it tells you but what they tell you how to live yeah tell you how little you know it doesn't mean oh it also tells me while ain't nothin I like to know the why don't just tell me go do that well now tell me why I need to do it and then maybe I can do it with an open heart and be able to understand why I'm doing this you don't know explain to me why explain why I gotta go visit them well God's come down and he's explained it nuts like I said like Sunday there's no other way could explain he said he said 66 books of the Bible he said the bottle probably pastors teachers in evangelists and this is the way it's gonna be they have no new Bible there's no you probably coming listen both we have come to the honing part because look Martin Luther John Wesley's a left-wing sentence what for someone else to come in it goes up and home the bride with it we don't have nobody else Jesus Christ is here on the earth and it's bright through fivefold ministry and we're looking for one thing I added that in man because I'm going with preaching on the rapture why why don't need preach on record why we gotta get this thing comes around first a rapture is attaching the way arrived for sure is a process I know that but a rapture is a one-time event don't catching away Bible doesn't drop by rapture this probably catch with big hops a lot of that resurrection if I get it there's names on the groundwork before there is interaction all right Khalid I'll look if you want the book we gotta find the voice of the resurrection and just so these two have been named so or we shall have to you say well we know the name Jesus Christ do we really know when that name is spoke what's behind that name it's the life behind the name makes the demons tremble yeah you say he's described all your life people do it now in Bulgaria okay but you said the right way guess what comes does the regulation come he said how did you know that he told you he said I am the resurrection and the light who said of that the Lord Jesus Christ that's one that name had to be brought back that's one of the name has to come back here the program talks about a name he said finally they named this that this person doesn't help I then his name that settled him with them so now we have a new name now father no those not not Lord one person and father's one person and sons of that person no one man was standing there when he said I am the resurrection II and say my father because we don't worry father what he says I am why the father never needed a reference right the son of God never died yeah I remember into that many times the prompt o son of God never died the storm and I cried but the son of man is the one that got resurrected so that's why the Son of Man message has got to be back in full power in the end time the Lord Jesus cars God in human flesh and the word was made flesh so that has to be transferred miss Eve or miss Jesus Christ to you not yes yes taken to the other day - my name look at the great thing that and nobody here in his church don't tell anybody here but I hate hyphenated last name yeah Jim Thomas died yeah Thomas was the slack you know the little more than their income are showing so far she not gonna be my head all you know we are we are mrs. Lord Jesus Christ because if you put a hibernation in there who you put in there I know the person yeah because the person of jim Dale LAX's unit never last name so Jim promises her whole name but Jim Thomas is no more now the living person she's up listen please don't deny you don't deny your family Eugene Thomas is still my father alone here Thomas but I'm not married to him right I'm not here there I am the head of Jim now dead comments alive day remember that's what the property guard said when you when you he takes the battle off of you you sure entered everything to help you sure entered everything why you surrendered your name your dad your dad you don't go back to that name not sure a weakness naturally we know that but look spiritually fiercely you can't trade even the Bible tells us in the book of revelations that you have a name that you live in by but you're dead what the denominations hyphenated their last name yes why you know what they put right their mission is Jesus Christ - amen they're mrs. Jesus drive tapenade and how to make messes what because they take a hit ship of that Baptist Church room after the church over then ship of Jesus Christ now you stop that that was fun I'm going to use that but look we're midgets Jesus Christ nor it's not right now that is something else gonna be coming back there happening today a man to connect their self back to a man sample rub out that there's only one ms g ms jesus christ not hyphenated and that's why he talked about their two-spirit cuz hook you got one here here which is righteous and then you got one spirit here which is you save you money and that's a trade you have a name that you live by but your day it's my life not Monday night I didn't want to dismantle by no one husband while so you not fully surrendered and that's what the Badgers they not they can okay I'll take you so far but we don't keep this father son Holy Ghost baptism we don't keep this Trinitarian doctrine we don't keep this we don't keep there and that's what Cain said will comes out this afternoon chain and it does word of God just like his daddy did or Satan through the beach good trip listen let's don't get technical canes father was the Beast see ya but the nature he got was from safe yeah just like me you've got the same one that what we gotta get it we got that okay and part we got to get rid of will rain a brother Adam really explained to them once message I will restore I think it is and about the two because he said that started the two three was Cain and Abel Cain's doctrine and Cain's doctrine is what killed me Bentley and that's what's been killing all down through the ages this maintains doctrine the two spirits then you come down to east on and Jacob you come down to Jesus in Jesus and you come down now to thee I don't want to say the message because it's in the message to I want to say the two spirits in the framework of a message Church one just as righteous and the other to a degree but they're going to turn one word down right there's like Satan added one word that same nature is still going to be there to either add some or take away from it and we know it I model says about that so now we come in the fourth seal the poor seal is the rapture seal this wind is to going up now you can say that because there's a end of the fourth seal the rapture takes place right now you can tip it inside all that or seal between the first seal all the way down is going to come a resurrection yeah and the reason it come is because of the next one do we talk about five six seven okay so we're going to split this these are all in yourself right you're not justified you flex right you know your science fair just fighting so you're not born again in your spirit you're borrowing it in yourself your body is just a vehicle to keep this thing together and it only does what we tell it for this what we inside of us tells it to do so what are we going to look down here we're going to look at the spirit and the body and we're going to connect them together because the body only does what the spirit fills it today I've always said your shoulders are real you your spirit remember even when you come into you by that body is no more than an animal I read it to you like Sunday it's animal brother on set in the womb of a woman is a flesh that is Wiggly muscles is all the city said there is no soul there's nothing to that that's just like an animal what book it but it's beginning it's beginning to be something yet because see your soul is your fire mechanism you saw this what really these done inside sure you can suppress this you can do this bubble I mean we get real technical but your soul is program said is the real you all right the real you but now you have to remember and let's get a little technical here there's a spot for that soul can't cross when our it triangle thing happenin guard you don't do that in your soul God never had a relationship with anyone in that way even brother Brennan said hey you say marry for this a he said you're having guard making relations with with merit you see how far he separated that son right you got me yeah cuz your soul never did any of that that's why I've been saying the soul he let his spiritual nature and take hold and then his body and all of you don't I go to church what is it problem anyway but she won't talk about so there's there's something that we got to get back the web at the Cardo line the Bible says this what enmity with God is a division yes but now remember what I just wrote down there is not wrong in our condition that we're in now because we have to do that to survive Yeah right there maybe if it was that I'm a little a little bit later come on let me go but your soul is pure if you're born again listen your soul can't have one mark against it that's what probably got there not one mark maybe you have in yourself try programs you don't even love with yourself you love your fear because remember and out here you've got what I was telling y'all deal today you got filial love but that soul right here that's adopted love that's a love that you never we don't understand that how love you we don't understand that kind of love yet and that's what this love right here not not love me does he know no that agape love one time grows a bunch of people out of a temple for doing the things wrong he's doing there one day and he said he's going to bury his family let the dead bury the dead comes over me yes yes no one said that was a doctor but that was that Jesus Christ was the epitome he would be a that he is agape so whatever his condition was now part from the eatin and you know being a human but there I thought they love is what we got to get back to and let it speak from down in the soul I'm telling you that's our problem we have it with our soul is enough we have bound it by our nature even the good even being born again we bound it by our nature that's why this thing right here unbinds it this is what I'm fine this doesn't unbind your soul your soul born again around here is just trying to get out it's trying to get to where it can operate like it did with Adam but we got to go reverse right we are no reverse because they love it for the the place that's that's right coming up to the profession of the spirit man which works its way out into the flesh all right because remember the flesh this there's no dominant flesh there's no patience is blessed there's no temperance in flesh your temper comes from what's inside you not this man he just tells you to follow your fifty study it just tells you what to say right so the body really for me that's what they're always the body is canceled out the body to me is canceled left it has nothing to do with my Redemption but it is redeemable because of what Christ did at Calvary because when he came up in that resurrection I was in you were in him all right Justin one point six men was in that land so whatever he had the property guys did we get two errors in joy narrative he get the body change we get money - right right men until - you're that sure that's what we're coming to we'll come to a resurrection but to get that resurrection we got to look at the fifth seals itself and obviously the seventh seal covers all the way back right what are hold about that this afternoon as far as the opening of the book and the sealing of the book text article you [Music]
