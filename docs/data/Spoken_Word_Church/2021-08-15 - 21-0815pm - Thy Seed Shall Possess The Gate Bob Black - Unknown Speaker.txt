be in the house of the lord let's go ahead and turn over into the book of genesis chapter 22 and we'll read verses 15 to 17. thank you you know you think about what brother branham said and the greatest battle ever fought when he was talking about how that ministers are are supposed to give people some some ammunition so to to to fight that battle i know i know we're all in our own little personal we're actually in a war and we're on we're all fighting their little battles and we all have things that we're that we're dealing with and so this evening maybe lord will and i can give you a little bit something to to kind of fight that battle with lay something in your hand and put something on your arm and on your head to fight to fight a little bit better with so uh this afternoon we're going to read from genesis 20 chapter 22 and maybe just take the topic of thy seed shall possess the gate and uh that's i believe that's the topic that's that's loaded for bear loaded for the devil we'll say that loaded for devil amen this is talking about uh uh just to kind of set the context abraham had brought his son isaac up to to sacrifice him and and after all that was done within the angel of the lord begins to speak to abraham and tells him this and before we go into the word let's just go to the author in prayer lord god we're so privileged to be able to look into your word lord jesus to gain strength and to be able to defeat the enemy with lord and i pray god that you'll give us give us power and an anointing lord jesus this afternoon to be able to have understand the true essence of what's written in these pages little god as we look into your word lord we lord we just open up every door lord this afternoon lord god that you'll feel welcome lord to move among the aisles lord jesus and they just have preeminence in our hearts and in our lives this afternoon lord jesus quicken your word to us now lord jesus and help us along life's road lord in the name of the lord jesus christ we have this ask this blessing upon your people and upon your word amen and it says the angel of the lord called into abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies now that's a that's a promise right there if we could really understand the essence of what that's saying then there's something there that we can grab a hold to and will give us overcoming power in this hour and he said in verse 18 and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now now brother branham when he was preaching thy seed shall possess the gate after trial he he began to relate this story and and actually if you if you study the message as many of us do here in this church we we really study it out and go and and and find the things that brother brown said really really like i like to call unpacking it and all throughout the message brother adam talks about uses this story as a basis to show that what the the the gift that god has given the the bride in this day and all down through the seven church ages but anyway and in this scene brother brown he kind of lays the context he said this is open and one of the most marvelous scenes of abraham and he's he's laying out this story of abraham going up just kind of imagine just to kind of set the stage that he he walks up and he he god has told him to go to sacrifice his only son isaac the son that he had promised him after after all these years of of age and and and trouble and turmoil in his life and and god promised him that he would give him this son and now he's he's come and told him to take him up on this mountain and and sacrifice him and so he he leads isaac up to the top of the mountain and you know brother brahm said that abraham if you really look at his life and that's why the bible says that that we're the seed of abraham because in abraham were all these attributes of things that a believer should should have so if you say that you are the seed of abraham then your life and the way that you look at the gospel should reflect in you in the same way that abraham looked at the word and looked at the promises of god and was steadfast in his faith and so we see this scene opening up at the one of the most marvelous scenes in abraham as he goes up and at the story of jehovah jireh that god would provide right there in that critical hour he provided he provided a sacrifice so that he would not have to kill isaac and he stayed his hand and there in the in the bush trapped in the bush was the was the ram that he was able to go over and take and kill in the stead of isaac now now brother brown said you know that abraham is the father of the faithful he's the father of the faithful so that means being the father of the faithful that you look back to him as your example and everything wrapped up in the way that he looked at the word as how you looked at you also look at the word and he said the promise was made to abraham so abraham that had that promise and he he you look at how abraham just held on to that promise that i believe that god is going to bring this promise to pass and he said only being heirs with him through christ is the only way we receive the promise is through abraham in other words the way that abraham came and looked at the word that's the same way that we get access to every promise that we have in court now now let's back for up for a second and remember what we're talking about here we're talking about the promise that thy seed shall possess the gate so if if abraham got that promise after he went through all the trial and endured all of the things and showed to god that his faith was true and something real now you can become a partaker in that promise that if a if god gave abraham that promise that thy seed shall possess the gate of your enemies now we're sitting in a moment where whatever your gate is whatever the battle is that you're fighting if you're wrapped up in christ and you've got the holy ghost now you've got access to that same promise that abraham had had access to now brother abraham said he was an example to what we should be he was an example to what we should be he said he said abraham was just an ordinary man many times we want to make these these great heroes of the faith something beyond some something something special within themself but all the only thing special about abraham was that he just believed god a man that was taken out of out of uh ur of calde somebody that was just an idol worshiper that didn't know nothing about god but yet one day god came on the scene and spoke to him and pulled him over to the side and said go this way and he turned and he began to walk a little bit different now you see that's the way that he does so many of us we we come out of different backgrounds and come out of religious different religious ideas but yet the the thing that makes us unique the thing that makes us special is not anything within ourselves that we can do anything that when our within ourselves that we can like push up or or pull up or anything but it's just simply that we just believe god so he said abraham was just an ordinary man he was called of god and he was faithful to that call so you see if we say where i'm the seed of abraham and we look back to the father of our faith then we also must be faithful to that call just as abraham was faithful to the call that god gave to him we too must be faithful to the call what that means is when you hear the message of the hour when you look into the word of god you've got to have something to stand for and that is the thing that you stand for in this hour you stand for truth you stand for righteousness you're you're standing something and you're faithful to that you're faithful to the word that you've heard your faith you're faithful to pray and to read and to study you're faithful to come to church you're faithful to it because you are the seed of abraham and he said when god spoke to him abraham now listen to listen to these attributes that he's laying out he said when god spoke to him that abraham never one time doubted that voice never one time did he doubt that voice all along the road when he was going to crucify to kill isaac all along the road of life when after god had pulled him over to the side and said go this way he never one time doubted that voice brother adam said he stayed right with it he stayed right now see if you say that you're the seed of abraham stay right with the word stay right with that voice of god because you've heard the voice of god just like abraham heard that voice of god you see you're on the same journey you're on the same road god pulled you aside just like he pulled abraham aside and he said no matter what the difficult was now listen to this no matter what the difficult was he stayed right with it you know life's road has many difficulties and many bumps in the road many things that come along many pains in your body many things that seem like they go awry you see loved ones pass away loved ones go through troubles and trials and it seems like a long last road that people turn against you and they don't love you anymore and seems like everything is going sideways but yet a real true seat of abraham will stay faithful to the call no matter what the difficulty was he stayed right with it no matter what the devil throws in your path in other words no matter what the gate is in front of you no matter what the day it is in front of the promise of god a real true seed of abraham is going to go right through that gate why because christ has conquered it for you he's already paid the price for you now listen brother brown said he said his faith was getting stronger as he walked as he journeyed his faith was actually getting stronger and stronger amen now now let's pay attention to this now brother brown said that there was there's actually two seeds of abraham there's two seeds of abraham in other words you've got to paint the picture like this there's a seed on the inside something on the inside something supernatural that's taking place something on the inside that'll hold you that'll anc you and then a seed on the outside the seed of your flesh abraham had a natural seed that that produced all the jews and all the israelites and all the natural genes but something something that anchored him that was a supernatural seed and the supernatural seed is what we're talking about brother i'm saying now one of them was natural seed the other one was a spiritual seed one of them was natural by his flesh the other one was the seed of his faith the faith that we also might be abraham's seed by the promised word now you see you you just picture now those two things have always been at war they're at war right now if you've got the new birth down on the inside of your soul you're anchored by that seed but yet it's at war with your outside that's been borne by flesh born by a lust desire a natural seed and that's it war with one another where on the outside you might have boils and aches and pains and things going wrong in your body but there's something down on the inside that's anchoring you that's holding you that seed of god the seed of abraham is what i'm talking about and brother now listen see as his outside began to get weaker and weaker and older and older and his hair began to turn gray and he looked on the outside and began to wonder how can god's promises come to pass how can i get a body change let's say it like how can i see god's word fulfilled in my flesh as on the outside i began to get weaker and weaker on the inside it began to get stronger and stronger and stronger his faith was getting stronger brother brahma said now after he had been tried for 25 long years instead of growing weaker he grew stronger now on the outside it looked like he was getting weaker on the inside he was getting stronger now how many we got to make this personal how many of us sitting here this afternoon on the outside it looks like we're getting weaker and our bodies begin to fail us our bodies begin to betray us as we say our hair begins to grow wider and we get we're getting older on the outside and you begin to wonder is it possible for my body to be changed is it possible for god's word to be fulfilled but yet because you begin to accumulate the word on the inside it's something is beginning to accumulate your faith is growing and growing and growing one day that faith on the inside is going to take over the weakness on the outside [Applause] brother brother said in elijah in the middle offering he said and if our father trusted god and took a promise and impossibility and held on to it for 25 years before it was ever manifested getting stronger all the time his seeds just like the father no matter what happens when we're prayed for is settled getting stronger all the time and he said and he piled those years up he piled those years up so as he got older and his body died out the wombs of sarah the womb where it got was unfertile and therefore his strength was gone and there was it's totally impossible we got to the place where on the outside it looked like the circumstance now let's we got to bring this home now it looks like if you look at all the circumstances if you look at the outside with all this covet and all this sickness and stuff going around the world that people died and things it begins to look like on the outside that you're you become just a failure you become a failure like abraham looked like he was a failure and like like jesus christ on the cross looked like he was a failure when he went to the cross it looked like on the outside he was a failure but he rose in victory and conquered everything conquered death hail in the grave came forth victorious because on the inside there was something there to anchor something there in abraham's life to keep him and there's something there in the life of every christian and bride that's anchoring that's moving you on even though it looks like on the outside see we've got to ignore that natural seed ignore the flesh ignore everything every ignore everything except we're licking to the unseen you see that's why paul said in romans 4 17 calleth those things which be not as though they were talking about abraham because abraham called the things that were as though they were not he was not looking at that outside veil he was looking at something that the eyes of the of your flesh cannot behold he was looking he was looking to the promise of god's word you know brother branham he gave us that example of how the old of the new testament are what god wants us to look through as we look to the promises they're like binoculars that if you hold them up to your eyes you use binoculars to look way off to look far off into the distance you see it doesn't make any sense to look at through binoculars at your wrist watch because they're made for looking far off too far off to god's promises you're actually looking at god's promises of what you're going to walk into you're looking you're looking and see abraham was not looking at his present circumstance he was actually looking to a city he was looking for a city that was yet to come and he was walking his whole journey was looking for something looking for something that god was going to manifest in his life maybe not even in his life but down the road his children children one day the seed of abraham would see those things that he looked for come to pass and all the time that he was walking his face began to accumulate it began to build up and build up and his faith was actually accumulating brother brown said in thy house he said friends a conversion outside of the same thing won't last long either he said when you go to church we're talking about accumulating now talking about piling up faith he said well i'm going to join church and i'm going to be baptized if that isn't coming from a heart of love to god yonder it'll never go nowhere all you'll do is join church and be baptized he said but when you're converted to christ a love to christ then you accumulate a faith in christ like you would to your wife or to your husband you accumulate a faith that you walk in that faith he said i don't know you just something about you you just got a something that anchors you there what's anchoring you the love relationship you have with god as you as you keep walking as you keep putting one foot in front of the other it begins to keep building up as you add word upon word preset upon precept your faith begins to grow it begins to grow from just a little baby form and growing and growing piling up until you begin to understand the things of god and understand understand that it doesn't matter what the outside looks like all that matters is something on the inside is taken over something on the inside is in control and god provided a lamb he said what is it love conquers all things love the lord with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind with all your strength then faith will accompany that love he said abraham had to believe god and order love god to believe him you love him and the more you love him the more faith will accumulate the more you love god the more your faith will accumulate and as you go you it's just building up building up you see like you see we want to pay close attention to what we're accumulating in life because you can actually accumulate the wrong thing and so we want to accumulate the word but you know you know i was thinking about so many times that somebody would be healed in brother branham's meetings and then they would go home and they would go listen to the naysayers at their church and they would listen to the people around them in their family that say well you you never really had that that that problem and your body so bad to begin with i don't know if you really got healed and they would begin to you they begin to pile on that accumulate all this doubt instead of actually accumulating something that will build faith you know brother branham equated it with with accumulating junk and there's a lot of junk in our lives if we can get rid of the junk and replace it with something that's real something that's supernatural then we're it'll the the the real the real thing is what will take us somewhere but we got it in life we got to get rid of all the junk all the waste that's so easily beset us all the stuff that's weighing us down now now brother he said in the message faith is our victory he said what if we were going to take now think about abraham looking for that city he's going somewhere and brother ram said what if we're going to take a little trip in 30 days from now to another land and in this land the climate was so wonderful till we never come back no more ain't never coming back when you get there you don't ever want to come back and over there we would never have to die or get old but we would just be there forever could i imagine seeing you going around to the 10-cent store buying up a lot of junk to take with you buying up a lot of junk to pile up and accumulate all your junk so that when you get there you'll have see that doesn't even show somebody in the right place frame of mind to accumulate you we see we so many times we accumulate all this worldliness and all this stuff that's not going to do anyth any good to us to help us get to that eternal home he said you'd be trying to get rid of what junk you had and when you just flustered yourself with joy in one church and then the other you accumulate more junk but if you'll think of where you're going think of that city think of that eternal home if you think of where you're going you'll get rid of a lot of that doubt and nonsense you'll have real faith and i i think about i think about you think about all the junk that we have in our lives all the junk that we carry along with us well we'll we won't even hardly come to church because of all the junk and the baggage that we've got we get offended at one another and it's just a bunch of junk is what it is we get all this baggage of nonsense that people have told us about i don't know if the healing is really for you i don't know if that message is really right and if you get around a lot of people like that you begin to just accumulate a lot of junk and a lot of trash but if you'll stay focused on the word of god and get your head buried in the holy of holies get all wrapped up in him you'll be wound up so much in him until it'll take you somewhere that's why the book of hebrews said let us lay aside every weight and the sin which just so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us let us lay aside every weight why because we're going somewhere that's why we dress right because we're going to a place that requires that kind of dress that's why we think right because it's transforming our minds so that we can get there every we got to lay aside that's why the song of solomon says take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines it's the little foxes it's the little the little things of junk of life that that hinders us and calls us and deter us from our goal he said let's get rid of the junk and accumulate something lasting you know what i i've kind of preached this sermon to my my kids before in one form or another and framing it like this that bless their hearts to be to be the a preacher's kids some but but i frame it like this sometimes that i want god i want god and man i want the devil i want everybody to know what side i'm on i will i want everybody to know whose side i'm on and if you're going around carrying a lot of junk with you and posting a lot of junk on facebook and on instagram and everything then can anybody know i want somebody to know whose side i'm on i want to i remember i remember when i was growing up in high school just just bear with me a little bit because when i was growing up in high school i went through a phase where you know i had this big old necklace on and big old gold i i i look like let i'll just put it like this i look like you couldn't quite tell what side i was on now believe it or not but listen to god god will get a hold of you i i put that out there because you know you just like you began to put abraham up on a pedestal you can start thinking that people started off a christian or whatever we didn't start off as a christian we started off a bunch of hoodlums we started off we started off on the side of the road and we needed to be drugged to where we were supposed to be going god had to get a hold of us so listen there was a time in my life when you might look i've looked in my life and been like what i wonder what side he's on but now i won't i want you i want everybody to know that i'm on the side of christ i want to be clean-cut dressed right talking right walking right i want everybody that looks to me to say that go as a christian that's my desire whether or not i believe it's manifesting that's my desire and i i want that for every young person every old person in this church that when they look at you they know listen when they look at your facebook or your instagram they're not questioning whether or not you got makeup on a question whether or not you sneak around behind your mama and daddy with pants on questioning whether you're sneaking around or whether you're really living a life i want somebody to know that i'm on the side of righteousness i want somebody to know that i'm on the side of god i want somebody to know that i'm on the side of the message not just dibble dabble not not just not believing some kind of new lukewarm religion some kind of where you're hot one minute hot when you come to church but when you go out the church door you're cold i want somebody to know whose side i'm on you know the the things you say the actions that you do they they actually represent something you know when you have an ambassador that goes to another nation the ambassador of the united states he'll go to another nation and the things that he says actually represents the united states even though he's not the president even though he's not you know uh maybe maybe somebody in a big authority or whatever but he's an ambassador and and the things that you say and the things that you do when you go out into school and out into the workplace they're actually representing christ because if you say you're a christian and you repre i this ain't even hardly in my nose if you go out into public and you're not representing christ then what are people going to think about that thing that you say you're representing you say you're a message believer but then you go out in public and you're not living the life of a christian you're not doing the things that are right i want somebody to know whose side i'm on i'm on the side of jesus christ now you think about you think about brother brown said lay aside all the junk lay aside all this junk in our life why because there's only one thing that you can take with you out of this life and that's your character and what character do we want to take i don't even want to take my character i want to take jesus christ character with us because that's the only thing that's got eternity with it that's the only thing that's got any eternal eternal quality with it eternal life with it it's the character of jesus christ that's what he's trying to mold in us the character the kind of character where somebody can say something against you and you won't rile back the kind of character that could endure trials the kind of character that can endure temptation the kind of character that can take up your cross and follow him the kind of character that can believe like abraham believes that's the kind of care that's the only thing that you can take with you all the junk of life doesn't matter all the things that all the things that sometimes we think are so important what other young people think about us who cares with other young people that are going down the wrong track care about you i want to care about what jesus thinks about me so we look so we look at he's talking about love you love and the more the more you love him the more faith you'll accumulate and it's all based on love now brother brown in this message he said see the bible the bible now what he's getting at now he's starting to lay down the foundation of what really happened there with when abra abraham and sarah's bodies were changed and all the things that are not written there and he begins to explain how you got to read the bible as though it's a love letter he said the bible is a supernatural book it's written so that it's hid from the school's theologian jesus said i thank thee father thou hast hid it from the wise and prudent and revealed it to babe such as would learn it's a book of love when the love of god comes into the heart then you fall in love with god then he reveals himself the bible meaning the interpretation of the bible is god himself interpreting his promises but the bible is written between the line in other words you you cannot read the bible through some kind of intellectual schooling understanding you can't read it through intellectual conception it's got to be a love relationship it's got to be it's a love letter that you got to understand the meaning between you you've got to have a relationship with the author to know what the real essence of it is it's it's like it's it's revealed through a love relationship with the author and brother compared it to like a love letter that he might get from his wife and anybody else would read that love letter and they would miss the true essential meaning here that they would miss all the things that she might be saying about how i miss you and i love you i care for you and he said i know what she wants to say see whether she tells me that or not see i know what she means because it's my love for her and my understanding you see so many times you'll hear people say well i i want to know what the seals are just drop it in my lap just tell me give me a good intellectual understanding of what the seals are if you want to know the seals or anything else in the bible then you've got to have a relationship with the author because only the author can tell you what the real meaning is so you've got to fall in love with god you've got to follow that's why we come to the church that's actually why we come to church not to not to be school and message theology but to develop a love relationship with the author that can tell us what the real essence of the meaning is now how many of us excuse me y'all how many of us maybe one time our kids when they were young they would bring us a little letter scrawled and crayon and it'll have all kinds of it words that only maybe they only knew what it really meant and you look at it and you say well i all these little squiggles and everything and you look at it and say well i don't know what it means and maybe you show it to your wife or your husband and you say what does this mean i don't know but you then you could go take it back to them the one that drew it and say tell me what this says and they could say well i it says i love you mama it says i love you daddy and you take it back to the author and the author can tell you what it says that's how the word of god is if you've got a relationship with the author you can take every promise back to him and he'll tell you what it says he'll tell you what it means listen that's that runs through through the whole bible from the beginning to the end from what happened in the garden of eden all the way to the book of revelation if you've got a relationship with the author he'll tell you what the essence of it is excuse me now brother brown said the william of sarah was infertile and therefore his strength was gone his strength on the outside and there was it's totally impossible the bible says in genesis chapter 18 verses chapter 8 18 verse 10 it says it says now abraham and sarah as they were sitting out there sarah in the tent and and the son of man came walking up and began to have a conversation with him and it says now say abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women so they were in a place where it began to look like it began to look like the promise was not going to happen i i'm really i know i'm repeating myself a lot this afternoon but i'm really you know you look around the message and people begin to get old and they begin to get aged and things and things begin to go start going wrong and you begin to get in your mind that you've got to be a young person or you've got to have a great quantity of youthfulness in your life you've got to still have that youthful spark for the word of god to be made manifest in your members but brother brahma said your old age and your problems and your frailty doesn't matter to god it doesn't matter to god one bit your old age does not matter to god your problems don't matter to god they were well stricken in age they might have had all this fatigue and headaches and mental decline and sickness and maybe we'll put it like this embarrassing doctor visits in that well streaking in age you start going to the doctor and you got all these embarrassing doctor visits where where you've got to do things and things that the doctor that that's embarrassing listen it doesn't matter your old age doesn't matter you're friendly i'm preaching a message of edification i'm trying to build up your faith i'm trying to give you something to help you with suck that natural seed on the outside doesn't matter what matters is the seed the seed of abraham on the inside brother branham as he's preaching this he begins to call out people in the audience and he said you people some of you that were crippled you might not see no difference for a while you might not see no difference look at abraham abraham did don't make any difference what that ain't what you're looking at you don't look at your symptoms look at what he said if you say i still feel the pain that don't have nothing to do with it it don't have nothing to do with it if you still feel aches and pains in your body if you can barely walk to your car if you can barely walk up the steps it don't have nothing to do with it he said you've done what god said do he said see don't look at that look at what he said you see this morning we're not looking at our own friendly and our own problems and whether or not we can do it and whether or not we can we can walk to the stairs or whether we can go up and down but we're looking at god's promise and we're looking at what he already said he said i can just see that that gray hair of sarah a little grandma with a shawl over her shoulder and a little dust cap holding a stick going around she said me having pleasure with my lord and him old too in other words we're too old to even think about having relations having marital we're too old for that we're too old we're thinking thinking that she was going to fulfill the word of god by her own ability but no it's not by our own ability it's not by our might or by by power but it's by the spirit of god and he said here was abraham this long beard holding on a stick as he was well stricken in age well stricken in age and i see the next morning his shoulders begin to straighten up the hump come out of his back her hair began to turn they went back to a young man and a woman yeah now see you see brother brown when he was preaching this he said people will say oh if god could just patch me up thinking about abraham and sarah maybe sitting there saying oh if god could just patch me up because we we get in our mind that it's not possible that we've got to be patched up here and there a little bit but god is going to transform our bodies wholly and completely one day we're going to be walking along and it doesn't matter how stricken an age are how you might even be on dialysis it doesn't matter what on the outside looks like but one day he's going to completely transform you he said he didn't just pat sarah up and patch abraham up he turned them back to a young man and woman now that may seem strange but now watch the rest of the word and put it together the word is inspired and you have to be inspired with the word i'm trying to express for you to you just because things might be going wrong in your flesh now is not the hour to be getting laying off your faith laying aside your faith now is the hour to begin accumulating your faith to lay a hold of what god is already saying to believe what he said right after that you see you see right after that read between the lines all of a sudden they up and they go on a vacation to gerrard now garrar is like a 10 or 11 day journey all the way over to the coast can you imagine abraham abraham may be talking to sarah and he's like you know what i think maybe it's time for us to take a little vacation after their bodies have been changed and if she was an old woman if she had been a little old lady you can't even in the south you can't get a little old sister to ride in the car with air conditioner for without air conditioning for about 30 miles they'll begin to say i can't put up with this now how would a little old lady put up with a 11-day trip to garrar on the back of a camel when her bones is falling apart and her hair is gray and everything everything's not working right that doesn't make any sense you got to read between the lines see read between the lines of what's happening and then when they got over there the amalek said that sarah was fair to look upon fair to look upon a little old lady fair to look upon there they were going on there on their trip no air conditioning no comfortable seating no rest stops no place to pull over for a quick bathroom break a quick quick trip into the gas station to get some snacks to get some of those little little combos or some some beef jerky or something to get a little root beer or whatever there was no place like that that would have not have been a trip for a for a little old lady to take on see brother brother said see read between the lines it's the type he said it shows that what he is going to do to all the children of abraham he's going to do the same thing to all the children of abraham he said just we're nearing it right now so our stooped shoulders and everything don't make any difference friends it don't make any difference how stupid shoulders you are how gray hair you are how all your bodies begin to fall apart he says in our gray hairs and whatever it is it doesn't matter now we don't look back and let's look forward to what we're coming to that's why the bible in first corinthians says in the moment in the twinkling of an eye in a moment and the twinkling of an eye you're going to leave all of the frailty behind we're not depending on our youthfulness or our vigor we're depending on the word of god to change us in romans 8 22 he says it says waiting we're all waiting the whole creation waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body in other words we're waiting for all that faith to accumulate so that to wit so that we'll understand so that we'll get a revelation that it doesn't matter about all our frailty and all the outside that we'll get an understanding that we're going to step over and then we'll do it from old listen from old to eternal all at once from old to eternal in a blink of an eye and a twinkling of an eye and a revelation just in a moment and a twinkling listen y'all might be falling asleep on me but listen i still believe that there's going to be a rapture i'm standing there there's going to be a rapture i believe that despite all the years of hardship and trials and travails there is going to be a group that takes a body change i believe that some sitting here today are going to be in that number that that one day they'll be walking to see grandma or they'll walk them be walking over to their neighbor's house and they'll be gone they'll be taken away because something will hap what will happen the same thing that happened to abraham and sarah the same thing that happened to enoch transformed by the power of god transformed by that seed of abraham and he said remember this sign that we're seeing this sign that we're seeing was the last sign a man coming up to abraham and sarah talking about things revealing to them the secrets of their heart with his back turned to the tent he said this is the last sign that abraham and sarah saw before the promised son come into existence now now just maybe think about that for a minute frame that in your mind before that's the last sign that sign before the promised son comes into existence before what's the promised son the son of man before the son of man comes into existence is revealed but that will be the last sign the sign of the son of man in other words before isaac himself christ himself would arrive that would be the last sign you think about how how much time has passed since we saw all those miraculous things brother branham turning his back on the congregation and speak of things exactly showing the same sign of the son of man that was shown to abraham and sarah and he said that would be the last sign before you would actually see that promised son come upon the scene he said we're living as it was in sodom the whole system has become polluted the world system everything the church system political system there's nothing politics is so corrupted now politics is so corrupted why are we so wrapped up in politics that's more of that junk that brother baron was talking about if we'll lay aside all of this junk and trash that ain't going to benefit us all then i believe we'll get somewhere he said the systems everywhere are dictators it's all corruption the church has become the same way families have become the same way it's just corruption he said then remember god has got that before you remember he said that he would represent himself in human flesh and would do like he did before sodom before the promised son came on the scene and that's why that's why i believe the message of the hour because it actually fulfills what was spoken of in luke chapter 17. it actually fulfills what was spoken of in matthew 24 that as it was in the days of noah as it was in the days of not so will it be in the days of the coming of the son of man and you there's no other fulfillment of those things of those scriptures outside of the message of the hour there's no other fulfillment and no other denominational system no other system of the world no buddhas no catholics nothing else will you find a fulfillment of those promises in the word the word of god you can look and you can search but you will never find the fulfillment of malachi 4 and of luke 17 and of revelation 10 and revelation 4 and all of those scriptures you'll never find it lined up so perfectly it's indisputable you see now when brother brown was preaching this message you see you conquer you have power to conquer every gate you have power over every gate of the enemy once you go through a trial to prove your faith and so brother branham was laying out in this message that abraham went through a trial and he went his trial was he take your take your child and take your the promised son take him up to the top of the mountain and kill him and he went through all the act he raised his hand with a knife in it he went through all the act and then god came on the scene and provided a ram there in the thicket now now you see brother brown said could you imagine isaac about 12 years old lovely little curly haired boy little brown eyes i'll imagine how that mother felt beautiful young woman and so and his father and one day god said i made you a father of nations through this boy but i want you to take this boy up on the top of the mountain that i'll show you and i want you to kill him up there for a sacrifice could you imagine that could you imagine could you imagine having to do something like that it was a test god god wanted to see if he would believe his word now see he's doing the same thing to you and i he's testing you to see see if you'll stay with the truth and if you'll stay with the truth if you'll stay with it and stand the test there's a reward to that now see he said did abraham fear no sir you've got to have the same attributes that abraham did abraham did not fear abraham said this i am fully persuaded that he is able to raise him up from the dead for i received him as one from the dead and if that commandment of god told me to do this and i've stayed true to it and it paid off to have given me the son god is able to raise him from the dead from which i received him as a figure listen there's some ammunition for you whatever gate you have in front of you in your life that's preventing you from attaining the promise of god there's there's some ammunition if you come with the promise of god in your heart like that i am fully persuaded god is able god is able to give me my children god is able to raise the dead god is able to change my body god is able to bring peace to my home then you'll something to get see something to begin to happen you see brother brother said god made the promise it's up to him to keep it sometimes cease how so often we flip the script on that we'll and we think that it's up to us to prove that we're christians we think that it's up to us to muster up within ourselves the courage and muster up within ourselves you're going to talk to people and you ask them well how did you ever come and they did a lot many times they'll try to explain to you something that they did well well i i i went and listened to the so-and-so philosopher or whatever i went and i tried these things and i tried this little mental exercise and that's how i over but that's not how a christian overcomes a christian overcomes by believing that god's going to do it and then god does it it's not us that does it it's god doing it and brother brother said if god give you pentecostals the holy ghost speaking in tongues how much more ought you to believe his healing power and his goodness and mercy if he did that against all the theologians in the country they said it couldn't be done but god did it because he promised god is able to provide he said when they got up there and he was obedient isaac began to get kind of suspicious he said father here's the wood here is the altar here's the fire but where is the sacrifice and brother brown begins to i'm kind of skipping over some things he began to explain what where did that ram come from when he looked over and heard the bleeding of the ram he said the country was full of lions and wolves and jackals and that sheep devouring beast all around was many obstacles to prevent a ram from coming on the scene and how far back from civilization was he and then up on top of the mountain where there was no water and he had picked up the stones all around to make the altar he had already been over all over that mountain and he didn't see a ram anywhere but all of a sudden right there in the hour that it was needed the most god provided a ram now he said to see how brother he begins to switch and begins to talk to the people in the congregation he said how you going to come out of that chair you in that wheelchair whatever your gait is whatever your problem is in your life how how is that child going to get well are you from that chair you from there you were the heart trouble he said whatever is the matter whatever it is in your life whatever is the matter god is able to provide for himself whether it's headaches or heartaches or heart problems or kidney problems or mind problems or depression or suicidal thoughts whatever it is god is able to provide he's able to provide he's able to come on the scene in the hour of need why because thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies see abraham believed it the patriarch stayed true to the promise and he give the promise that your seed because you believe my word and regardless of what the circumstance is regardless of the circumstance your seed shall possess the gate of his enemy [Applause] now what what is what is his seed that seed is crushed so if you can get in that get in that seed become part of that then you've got access to that promise you've got access to the promise that thy seed shall forget possess the gate of his enemy now the promise of abraham brotherhood says was that his seed now his royal seed in other words the the supernatural seed we're not talking about a natural seed but the supernatural seed his royal seed also as i told you a while ago and this seal that he give abraham was a seal of promise and the royal seed according to ephesians 4 30 is sealed by the holy ghost after they have stood the test now this comes from galatians 3 16 that says now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith unto seeds as of many but as of one not as unto and to cease as a many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ so if you get sealed into christ if you get sealed into him then you've got access to this promise he said you believe every word then you are sealed after the test when we believe every promise in the word then we are sealed by the spirit to confirm the promise that's what is what abraham the way he did it the way abraham did it then and then only have we the right to possess the gate of our enemy now listen to this he said you cannot do it until first you become that seed you cannot do it until first you become you cannot do it on your own he said a lot of people thinks they got to be something a lot of things people think they got to be something or do something to work something up he said just common faith is all you have to to apply the blood by just calm and then it begins to talk about the token now you know how in the old testament they would take that blood and apply it over the little of the door with just some some just some simple basic one of the questions that the young people had when at the youth gathering was how do i have faith just as simple as just coming i believe that when i start my car i'm going to come to church i believe that when mom and daddy promises that they're going to give me an allowance every week that that they're going to give it to me and that's faith that's the same way that you approach the word of god you take that little hyssop of that common weed and you brush it in the blood and you apply it now how did brother brethren say to apply it you just say i believe that you promised it lord and and i got this problem in my life and now i'm applying the blood to that problem in my life i'm turning it over to you i'm putting all my cares upon you i got all these problems in my body but now i'm applying the blood to the situation i need the holy ghost in my life but i'm applying the blood to it you promised it and now i'm taking the simple faith and i'm brushing it through your promise through what you did on the cross and i'm applying it to the situation that's how you apply the you're applying what he already did to the situation you're applying it how do you do it through simple childlike faith just coming to it with like a little little a little plant that you would grab off the side of the road i just believe your promises you promised it and that's and i believe it he said hear the word believe the word apply it that's all i'm skipping through i'm skipping through some things here now listen let's look i i didn't i really didn't mean to to keep you long so i'm gonna i'm gonna try to to kind of skim through some of this he's now see the naturals that you there's two c's brother around little brown said the two the spiritual seed and the natural seed the natural seed and he said listen let's just say check some of those natural seed and see if god kept his word with the natural seed which was isaac and he said they many of them failed bitterly failed because in romans chapter 2 for he is not a jew the natural on the outside you would think that a jew somebody that that was a an israelite would be able to fulfill and do but that's not what it religion is not what we need we need actually we need something more than religion we need something supernatural religion is when you try to do it your own self when you try to cover up you're going to church and you're going through the motions and you're going you've got your own little moral code and you come to church and you've got some things that you believe are right to do and wrong to do and you come to church and you maybe you pay your tithes and you're doing some good works but when something supernatural begins to takes place it elevates it from just from those dead works that you're just doing day by day just because of you've got some good religion and it begins to it begins to make it alive and he said so in romans chapter 2 verse 28 says for he is not a jew which is one hourly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart and the spirit and not in the letter and that's when the jews began to get mad at jesus because he began to explain to them that your natural lineage is not good enough you need to be born again you need something on the inside and they begin to say you know our fathers ate manna in the desert that's it's written he gave them bread from from heaven to eat and he said your father's eight men are in the wilderness and they're all dead why were they dead because they had a good religious covering they were nice religious people he said death take that word and run it see what it means eternally separated yet they were abraham's seed death means separation annihilation completely destroyed see poor folks just because we're methodist or baptist or presbyterian god a little confession and things like that the devil believes just as much as we do and i'll say maybe maybe incorporate this a little bit just because we say that we're good message people that we come and sit in a message church religion is not enough churchianity is not enough we need something to deliver us from our christianity it's the power of the resurrected christ that will conquer every enemy your churchianity and your your religion is not at your moral codes and your pursuit of something that you believe to be important is not enough you need something you've got to be identified with the sacrifice god has got to witness it to it by a sealing with the holy spirit that breath that sets you up to where there's no question of the word and brother brown said when a man sees the word of god made plain before him and identified and then shuts and pulls down his denominational curtains there is something wrong with that man spiritually when he looks through his natural eyes of lacking understanding and tries to understand it and just turns away you need something supernatural to give you supernatural understanding brother brown begins to run through all these old testament old testament heroes of the faith that that showed that that came to the test like daniel that was tested for the worship of one two two god he was tested for that and then at the time of test he stood the test he said daniel stayed true to the test that there is one god and he possessed the gate of his enemy god had closed the mouth of the lion daniel was not ashamed to pray and worship god you began to look at all these heroes and how they came to the test and how they overcame and how they conquered the gate of the enemy and you can apply that to your own life and conquer the gate of the enemy in the same way moses that stayed true to the promised word before the false impersonators janice and jamers in the test that when he came and he threw down his his rod in front of him and here came janice and jammers to try to do the same thing he just stood back and waited that was his test because he was trusting in the and what god had told him to do he just stood back and and truck you know what brother brown said that is i i think it's why why it had to be shepherds he said that that was a type of of of the scripture that says though heaven and earth shall pass away my words shall never fail and there you've got a picture of of moses throwing his serpent down and those two other serpents typing heaven and earth passing away falling being swallowed up by the word of god swallowing them up and moses didn't throw up his hands say well i guess it's all wrong and joshua they came to a place called kanesh and he had he passed the test the center of the world at that time and so much that that was the judgment seat and oh they sent out 12 spies to look at the land and 12 of them came back he said 10 of them said oh it's too much of a job we just couldn't do it well then people they look like grasshoppers by the side of them but joshua and caleb steal the people said wait a minute we're more than able to take it no matter how little we are or how much in the minority it doesn't it doesn't matter what the outside looks like god is god is able we serve a living god that's able to deliver us he said what was he doing he was standing true to that promise i give you this land but you fight for every inch of it and you'll fight for every inch of your land you you know how we fight we don't have to we don't have to get thank god we don't have to get a sword of it up and and go swiping people's heads off and and go fighting like the israelites did but we fight by by not accepting any of the devil's lies we fight but by when you go into your workplace and people begin to say i don't believe that god that you proclaim you're fighting because you're you're standing for something that's true when you stand your ground and claim what god has promised that god promised that for he promised healing in your body and salvation for your soul and for your family you're you're actually like fulfilling the scripture that says the the violent take it by force you're actually you're actually fighting for what you believe in and you've got to fight for every creature of ground you take when the doctor tells you it's not possible for you to be healed when the doctor tells you something something despairing in front of you it's time to fight he said no matter how big you are and what the opposition is and what the doctor said god give the promise it's up to god to do it he said what did joshua do when he come down to the river of jordan he possessed the gate that's what he did jericho closed up like a turtle in a shell what did he do he possessed the gate even one day when his enemy was trying to take him he possessed the gate of his enemy so much that he commanded the son to stand still how could he do that because he had passed the test he had he had proven that he was willing to fight and stand his ground for every promise of god he was willing to take god at his word despite how all the circumstances looked right god is true to his promise no matter what he has to do i love this quote he said bankrupt the heavens before he would let his word go defeated he never made a promise that he can't keep i'm the lord that heals all that disease now if you come to god if you come laying laying his promises before him like that i believe that you said that you'd bankrupt the heavens before you let your word go defeated something that that's how you conquer the gate that's how you conquer every gate of the enemy and then after all those natural seeds finally on the scene came the royal seed of abraham the one that we're talking about they were all the natural seed from isaac but here come the royal seed of abraham which was christ abraham's seed of faith what we're supposed to be just see how whether we are or not he said now the natural seed only was a type all others was born of natural birth but he come a virgin birth see that wasn't of the seed of abraham then a jew he come by the seed of faith of the promise and then we're supposed to be his children through this man now think about what this man did that came upon the scene he it looked like he was a failure when he died on the cross and when he was buried in the grave but he when he rose up he conquered and possessed every gate the enemy had the royal seed he promised it by the word he conquered it he conquered every seed he now now there's some there are some powerful things that i believe will give you some ammunition this afternoon i feel a little bit like i'm plowing this afternoon because i'm fighting some sleeping spirits but but but i believe there's some yeah y'all pull a little bit come on now [Laughter] hey listen brother brahma said he con the the power in this is that it's not you that's doing the conquering he rose he died on the cross and rose from the grave to pay the way for every promise in the god of god every promise every blessing that's written in the bible that's why he said he conquered the gate of sickness for us that's what he come to do he conquered the gate of sickness for us he remembers sick people he conquered that gate you don't have to conquer it he conquered it you don't have to conquer it a lot of times we go to the doctor and we get that bad report and we feel like we've got to conquer it so that we can go back to church and we can prove to everybody what a christian are what what a real christian is but a real christian is resting rest and you just sit back and you say god you promised it i ain't got to do nothing i don't have i don't have to do anything all i have to do is believe it that's how you'll conquer the enemy it's just putting all your faith in the one that conquered everything when he rose from the grave the other men had to conquer their own gate brother abraham said but you don't have to conquer it's already conquered he conquered the gates of sickness and what did he do when he conquered the gates of sickness saying that he would whatever you ask on earth and whatever you bound on earth he would bind it in heaven he said he'd give us the keys to the gate so he conquered the gate and then he gave you the keys to it so you could go through it you could blast through it you could say you could just ignore all the stuff the devil's doing ignore the infirmity of your flesh ignore the weakness of your body ignore all the gray hairs ignore all the naysayers and just plow straight ahead to victory he said he conquered the gate of temptation by the word and the keys was resist the enemy and he'll flee from you he conquered it all conquered every sickness he conquered death and he conquered hell he conquered death and hell he conquered what the others couldn't conquer because they're of the natural seed this is the spiritual seed he conquered the gate of the grave and rose up on the third day for our justification and now we are more than conquerors we're more than conquerors through him if we'll get in him and bury ourselves in him we'd be we've become through through that because he gave us the keys he said whatever you bind on earth i'll bind it in heaven that's the royal seed of abraham his promise that's actually fulfilling that promise that he gave to abraham thousands and thousands of years ago that thy seed shall possess the gate of thy enemy thy seed thy seed which is christ and if you're part of christ christ is working through your members christ is working through your life to overcome to overcome he's seated at the right hand of the father to overcome every battle to fight every sickness to fight everything that the devil throws at you you see we're not a defeated army we're not a defeated people this afternoon we're not like people say well i don't i don't see all the miracles i don't i wonder if god's still present i wonder if he's still doing so let me declare to you this afternoon that god is still the same yesterday today and forever he's still the same as he was when he was when he was when he stood by moses when he threw his rod down he's the same as he was when he stood by joshua when he crossed over the road the the jordan river he's still the same as he was when he stood by all those hebrews of the faith that stood by him amen that's why brother abraham said with the same spirit of god in us that was in him we are more than conquerors with that same spirit of god in us that was in christ we are more than conquerors every gate has been conquered for us the only thing we have to do is possess it it's already conquered the only thing you have to do is just go get it go fight for it in other words go go apply the blood go stand believe it that doesn't mean see it doesn't mean that there's not going to be a battle there's going to be long nights in prayer long nights of study what do these things mean is the bible true is all these things are these kings correct how can i apply them in my life but when a gate stands before you it's already been conquered and all you have to do is go out and possess it he said if it's sickness you are more than a conqueror for it we are more than a conqueror and the seed of abraham shall possess the gate of the enemy when they say these things cannot happen when they want to call the devil or be elizabeth or something else god is sure to conquer every gate and take the enemy and that's why he said and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy what are we afraid about possess the gates we have god's promise we have his word we have his holy spirit the angels are kept about everything's in order every wall can be took down it's already took down the son of god goes before us his banners are waving and there's nothing can stand in the way of a saint going to meet a promise of god death can't stop it the grave can't stop it the devil can't stop it we are more than conquerors sickness is conquered for you friends death is conquered for you unbeliever once you receive him habits has been conquered for you temptation's been conquered you say i got a temper i can't get over it it's conquered he's already conquered it the great final seed of abraham there's no more conquering to do now he conquered for us i'm i'm reading straight out of the message he said all this whatever problem you have in life whatever thing that you're dealing with that you want to get rid of whatever it is it's already conquered all you've got to do is go out and get it go apply the blood go see seize the gate go you've got the keys to get through the gate you've got ever you've been equipped for the for the battle the word says it and you were called to possess the gates of your enemy and i'ma close on that the musicians just go ahead and come the gate the gates of hell shall not prevail because you are the seed of abraham and you've got a promise that thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy and brother branham when he got to the end of this message he asked them the question what kind of a gate stands before you because it doesn't matter what kind of a gate it is it doesn't matter it's already conquered so i want to ask that to you this afternoon what kind of a gate do you have in
