========================================

while we're here this morning good to have sister takes green with Nathaniel is in the bullpen unit right boy he's a little bit nervous people wait he'll be all right it'll be fine Vegas doesn't know he's coming he just definitely will be fine go away yeah there's only one thing the devil gives you in that's members missing feared God never gives you nervousness and fear no man okay so you know it's a lot of them so let's go to Roman's now we've got our thingy up here did you ever get one no cuz when I Richard called me and said I'm getting in I said you barely Rebecca no because she said he said I got it I got the cable as he heard tell them thank you cuz I know Rebecca's gonna give me so but it was a little different than this one so we've upgraded but we still got this one casing you I've and it's different but we're going we're talking about the book of Romans I want us to like I said it bracelet and he'll do just fine we heard from Kristen yeah as far as you know yeah yeah I think this I told anything yet Jim the second or something next wait less you got a holiday this yeah coming up the wall I'm at it we need to remember them home all day we don't remember the lab ones we remember the one just went home Memorial Day is for those that have already passed it's a memorial for those that have already gone you don't only remember the ones that went on is Memorial Day back up days ones we remember the loudly yes you thank them for their service thank you so now we're in a book of Romans now guess get started faces a new book of Romans we begin by telling you that Paul was not in Rome all right Paul was going to Rome so he would had studied the wrong he had been her own cooking Roman citizen right calling for Roman citizen and he knew the ways of the Romans they were completely painting right right okay they were completely pagan beautiful honey dripping out by a filter that huh picked it up took the picture that man well we just lifted the filter up and I took the picture as it was dripping down some okay makes me when we're gonna extract next week so the Lord forgive us we get crop on honey insulin thank the Lord and the bees but we come down here and we were looking and I found out something too okay that reading the King James Version is good but I went back and found my emphatic die Glocke everybody knows what that is that the Latin Vulgate this is the original not the King James transcribed this is what they transcribed from okay and it's really good to read this I like to read other commentary but this is the pure word this is exactly translated from what was written when Paul Ridd with his own hand to what is saying and then they took this and made the King James Version of it now we know that it's been verified but no brother Brian said that that was the King James Version was diversion that they got like and that he used and it was but in order correctly we're going to read this and we've already went went through some of this and I'm gonna come back that much but Romans is the longest letter that Paul wrote to the Christians in Rome and it's and the letter is long because he brings just like rough to me ruins and Hebrews are probably the two best books because what he does even in Romans he goes back into the Old Testament gets a lot of the Old Testament scroll updates them in and that's what he a lot of times folks if you'll really remember what you read in the Old Testament he's quoting Old Testament scripture thank you and if you're looking here Scott we got stoked Leo Scofield does a good job stopping you in relating back to an Old Testament scripture in that middle middle part right here that's why I'm brother round I believe like Scofield all these commentary they're good some of them are not good but this in the middle is exactly if Paul was talking about something toefield would relate you back to Deuteronomy 10:17 and all different one even back to Matthew Roman didn't take you through the scripture that's why I'm like let's go Phil and this is the King James Burke Scofield King tank version with all the commentaries and then you've got your Twilight this app because you can match that go to your strong concordance and it tells you what that word means and how many times it's been used and what the book to the Bible is used in so I like this after the Jakarta is the name of the after the Bible isn't in you got different application I look to see if they had any dialogue but they did not but I got this years ago and I like looking through it because it tells you exactly what he said cuz look look at verse 11 right here I got verse 11 I'm gonna read it to you out of the original everybody see that for I'm greatly desired to see you that I may impart to you some spiritual gift for your firm establishment now that's what Paul said in the original that was his original letter and then man translated it which is fine too for a long to see you that I may impart of you some spiritual gift to the end you may be established this is for your firm establishment so we're going to try to now as we go read King James we're going to come in on it and then I'm going to read you what it says in the in the Dyke lot and I think we got down to we got the worst 18 so let's go to 18 and let's talk about this for a minute let's go back up to 17 now you read it on this screen and I'm gonna read it to you right here but the righteousness of God my faith is revealed there in order to in order to faith as it has been written but the righteous by faith shall live so you're eating for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith now we know that Scripture comes from two places in the Bible right one of them is Ibaka - in 4 and in Galatians 3:11 but about the 2 and 4 in the Old Testament the Bible tells us to just show that by faith what happened was that man didn't catch that morning Brooker man didn't catch that okay but a man named Martin Luther reading the Bible read the just shall live by faith and turn the world upside down just by that one little scripture ok and we make it into a little more that this afternoon but I'm gonna have to background son for the breach of the seal but the just shall live by faith is totally contrary to any Roman doctrine any Roman idea Roman Catholic Church Roman Catholic Church that's where the Turk came out of was Rome right and the nastya Rome that was all done in Rome so what what I'm telling you is when you read this that's why I want you I've always been a person where you just don't tell me what it says give me the background let me know what Paul is I actually think it right I try to put myself and you should do the same thing cuz if God's talking to you he's not talking to Paul he stopping to you sure he said something to Paul because you weren't a lot of its time but Paul knowing an end of it you know how great this is listen how God works Paul died in 80-66 somewhere there he didn't even know John he knew done but John went to Patmos after that Paul yath and Paul had no scripture old are new that told him about see yet the seals that we preached and the seals that brother Branham brought is laced all in the book of Romans and all in the book of Hebrews and everything - Paul wrote Grievous wolves all these different things he knew that tell us what there are some among you look right here where the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth they hold the very truth in their hand and they turn and make it unrighteousness now the Bible says here in the original says besides the wrath of God is revealed from heaven in regard to all impiety and injustice of those men who drew injustice suppress the truth you see the meaning behind that suppress the truth and that's what they've done they helped the tree because how can you hold the truth that being righteous the truth is the truth is the truth right and the truth is righteous but when you watch suppress the truth not what did they do when that first horse rider went out in the first church age first research agency was a lot righteous man church but it was all our position what did they do they suppress the truth sir anthias all those won in Iran it's this time Saran this branding the doctrine that Jesus wasn't God through the rivers or we see that in a message now that was an old devil from a long time ago grocery this is dead and gone but the doctrines not that's right I'm playing a messy fix that same demon up and watch suppress the truth and that's the problem we suppress the truth you can't do a leg of the truth but you can suppress it and that's what Paul is telling the Romans that there's men among you who hold the truth now remember the tree at that time was not the Bible just think what ready now they were Scrolls there was the Torah there was the Old Testament prophets that Paul could read because being studied under Gamaliel he had access to all the old written scripture but there was no Matthew Mark Luke John acts Romans Galatians Ephesians none of that was written so they possibly go back and say well these men are reading the Bible and getting untruth no they kind of entry straight from the devil right listening to what Paul said our Peter our John are all the ones that spoke truth in that time because listen truth has to be presented to you listen to me truth has to be presented to you if trick if non truth is presented to you you're gonna believe that is true right I mean you come to a Trinitarian religion now that wasn't true that all but you held it this truth because what happened is that demon and it's a demon suppress the truth back in the first church a second Serge's third dress why these seals are so important I was thinking this morning and I'll get it one at this afternoon the seals are for you they're for you personally I hope every time I tell you that we're brother branham said it's not for you it's not gone from you it's not even for you people that are sitting there not 63 in other words is for a group of people does not even sit in this room which most of us was three years old in 1963 some of you were older so maybe we're gleaming a moment that is up but we weren't later now we're here the Spirit is here to anoint two people the right people for the right time and the right place and that's what I'm contending that right now the people are on the earth that needs to be on the earth to take a body changes it's never been before that's basically the same thing basically the same thing because this suppressed entreated is that let's take for example even Martin Luther Martin Luther read the just shall live by faith Martin Luther read the Torah which said there's only one God behold o Israel your God is free no he's the bill deliver you've got one but now Martin Luther anointed by a demon sorry which can't be anointed by God and tell a lie he was anointed by a devil on his spirit round not his soul this spirit realm to teach at ranat Aryan doctrine that's my brother Brown said and I read it to you the other side he's a Trinitarian doctrine come from hell it did not come from heaven so who's in hell the devil so it comes from the devil all right that's one a weed that's why I like to now as we're bringing the seals out to see more that we like I said compartmentalize and I think that's what Paul's doing he's compartment life and he said okay the soul is fine we are working this spirit room Oh wretched man that I am always saying o wretched man I am in his soul that thing inside of him was the Holy Ghost that was a prophetic gift he had but what was he talking about he's talking about the middle man the spirit realm the memories and constant affection imagination and remember one more time this thing does not sin it's a fifteen and will manifest in but you don't sin with your buddy you wanna give you a quote the Bible said Jesus said now before Jesus came if a priest preacher whatever were to touch a woman and then how an act with her he committed adultery and they killed him right Jesus comes up and says I say unto you now was he saying not in your flesh in your spirit realm you lust after a woman right you already know your flesh never done it so you plate you know what I'm saying take the flats out of the way it's that spirit realm that we are contacted both from Dawn and from the devil that's our problem that we need to work on and I believe that's why the sealed opening up to me that's the thunder the thunders telling them saying we're boring in our soul it's just as perfect as dotty if Paul is not saying he's lost Polly puddled a born-again believer but he's still saying the things I would not I do think I do and I know that's not with this guy that was what the inner man doesn't listen this is only motivated by what you think we're all adults here you know they say the biggest sex organ is your brain right well that's not your flesh is your brain your brain is what's your problem in your body holding wraps because it's connected to them to the brain right but that soul of man si si so special that we know that the souls born again is untouchable this is finished it's over that Genesis 1:26 man that I love so much that man is now empowering we can sit here and not be like Martin Luther and let's say to run through a filter but God said okay you're gonna preach suggest you live by faith I'm gonna put my stamp of approval on that and that's what you're gonna preach because Jesus I mean God deliver you want to say never put his approve and often he never put us approval on an eternal hell all right that's why we're compartmental I will move these things out of the way and just let this hone in on the spiritual man because you got to read the Bible if the Bible's written to Christians you can't say that we are still mongers and Liars and remembering when we read that the other day in Galatians I believe it it man he got us all he said says for some of you but you're washed your sanctified and what you're just as righteous as God is in your soul and what's going to happen one day is we're going to realize that that thing can't be can't stay in there it's gonna work its way on out it and the Holy Ghost well I didn't bring the quote with this Sunday by will next Sunday but I said we'll fill every fiber of your being well now you have a distance fiber so the Holy Ghost is gonna have to fill this thing this thing that mom and dad brought on the earth is dying you know getting worse going to the doctor and all these things that's not your soul person that's just the body that has was born in sin the product of sin but we have to deny that that's got to be denied and we got to go on with God but the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of God is manifest in them for God hath showed it to them nowhere got shown them the truth now to me see there's that mystery of iniquity because iniquity is what knowing to do good and don't do it or knowing not to do it and you do it anyway alright cuz look realize this there is no false doctrine ever come from God so these preachers in the message reads they're preaching these things that are their faults that didn't come from God I don't care if they raised 25 million dead people I really don't care doesn't bother me but if he'll point me to the right word of God and what will what he says will ring true with me than Amen whatever he does but now if he takes me to another god I don't care if you have signs and wonders I really don't they don't bother me one bit but now people in the message is just it's just we're just they're just waiting you just watch I'm dead that's a long time you just wait there's no man in this message is going to jump up now signs and wonders and healing but you'll take them away from you line you watch them say go that's what people wait know what where to sign what does this pledge thing is what gets all excited yeah but remember it's a soul's right somewhere you'll all align backed up now you might get off a little bit sure enough honestly you can get off a little bit we've had things in our mind that we thought out that we thought was right and the preacher come along and preached that it wasn't and what it lines everything right back out that doesn't make us lost but if we would have denied the truth that's what these through they've denied the truth they hold the truth and they deny telling it to the people we'll see Paul's already seen that and that's that while horse rider this attacks just up to the church then we go to read then we go we'll talk about the black horse this afternoon because that was made known to God Memphis okay for the invisible thing this is what I like I like this right here but I go back to the quote where brother Brown said that the most illiterate person can get born again it's not because you're education that's not that you can read and it's not that you can understand all the fields and the plays at the bottom it's believed one of the Lord Jesus Christ enough that they say but watch is for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen what being understood by the things that are made want us to about us even his eternal power and Godhead that they are without excuse my living reason what it says in them in degree that's number 20 for the invisible things even his eternal power and deity since to create the world are clearly seen being perceived by the things which are made so that they are in excusable so here we go an illiterate man that can't even read but anybody with one I have sense the immense them knows that we were born in some bad condition because we're dying we have these evil thoughts we do these evil things right so you take a man who can't even read but he stepped on his porch one day and he hears one somebody a Christian her life has to come through the body he hears a Christian talking about something different than what he's talking okay and so now that illiterate person can say okay I want what you got what's that person gonna do that person that you don't even have to take you back to the Bible and let that show weakness did you take in the Bible but I don't have to take people to the Bible right tell them how brother Graham didn't say tell him how to read the Bible used to tell them how your fire got lit your fire got Lee know how you got to come where your aspect then you can think into the Bible maybe didn't but when a literate person could see Godhead the Godhead can be explained by just being a human being of course we are we are finite he's in finite but even being finite I'm a father I'm a son a minister a human husband I got 20 different titles but I'm one person to my grandbaby when she walks up then I become a granddad to her I don't treat her like a lot I treated like a granddad so I've got these attributes in the same way I sway the Godhead the guy that can be explained by what but understood by the things that are made because God didn't create us Sonny creates to be different he created he created Adam and Eve perfect and then and then Satan comes into what not into flesh and I don't still had all the working parts before then they just brother Brent said he had the Holy Ghost bail over his wife mine his mind had a Holy Ghost bail over nine his body his mine so what did Adam do when he stepped out into that middle realm that memories and conservation imagination because that affections not affection to going V Leo love has no affection to God yes right called is totally contrary it is it's totally country do you think about figlio will have it's contrary to God it's already closed it causes us to do what we do procreation and all these things that's not of God is permitted if nothing wrong with it if it's done right but from that realm it can be done wrong so he steps out into that realm so what Adam do I'm still well I gotta do something trying to step out in that spirit realm yeah dude till he sold us out he didn't sell us out in that in his soul he sold us out in this in his bare ground then what his body reacted to what he was thinking that he'd never felt those thoughts before and his body reacted he did what he did so to me it's very simple when you take those three and really we preach body spirit and soul for years but we really never compartmentalize and said okay if the soul is born again move it out of the way you can't perfect perfection because if you're born again I'm telling you we're going to preach on that one day about the power that lays inside of you because the Holy Ghost inside of you is perfect never send a day in its life never had a false doctrine never had a pulse 'are there any error in its life but remember if there's one thing held against you God can take you together so if you're going again that soul that's why those who he has justified if you keep on going he is already glorified all right so that's in the that's in the soul of man but the spirit realm remember it's where remember God took the heart Satan took the where's your memory come from where's your reasoning come from where did your conscience come from where did your faxing come from where's your imagination come from okay but through to that though being born again though we are turned and that's what Paul is talking about these men are not doing it watch but we're going to watch and see what happens real quick before we go to get finished with this because they took the truth and held it in unrighteousness and this is what happened that's why you'll see you will see and you can look back and brother let me tell you many things being in the message almost 60 years then any false doctrine if you stay in that false doctrine it leads you into a well let's just say one Fox talking about though the plant another seed well this preacher finally plants the seed in them eighteen year old girl you know truth right because of its doctrine Guardian tell him to do that you see so what happens then they're holding the tree watch what happens when you hold the truth in unrighteousness let's read you know what goes Paul already saw this what because he's telling it they are no excuse that we are to see anything but one God see anything but the purity of the gospel and even his eternal power and Godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God now that new is not new like Adam knew his wife right because when you know God in that way when you have an intimate relationship that's when you go into that holy of holies and you you're going in in your soul those people never did because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither we're thankful but became vain in their own imagination and their foolish heart was darkened that's what we're going to talk about today that's why I said Paul is preaching the steals we just he didn't know what to call them now we know what call them looking back we can see because we're looking at today we're looking at the dark horse the black horse and it's not so much physical death but they're killing these people spiritually spiritual Destin's way worse than physical death right because you're alive the Bible says she is what she's what alive but she's dead while she's living right and she's the church I'm not talking like the women I'm coming when I say she knows I'm at the church they include all most men included we are the church yeah but what they took was that they took that letter though and they ran it through a filter they became fools he's going to tell you exactly what's going to happen to watch excuse me because what happens you take the desire in your heart and you don't put God in there the devil is going to watch this is what the devil is going to do for you and we see this more in this day than it wasn't in back then professing themselves to be wise they became fools now think of all the false doctrine that's been in the message and how they went off on polygamy and adultery and all these different always leaked why because that soul is not anchored in the word amen so the real person shows up and manifest through the flesh look and change the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man in other words image are a Idol Birds four-footed beasts and creeping things wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves look who changed the truth of God into a lie hmm about that let me read it in the original who exchanged the truth concerning God for a false religion and reverence and served the creature rather than the Creator who is worthy of praise to the ages amen to change the truth God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature in oil into flesh more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this call God gave them up until vile affection for even their women did the natural use into what should against nature we know that idea that played an ism all right because remember people what they manifested equal won't we mount offense when brother branham saw that one brother remember he discerned that he was committing adultery right he went to the brother and then what God revealed the brother branham that that was a demon that he was messin with organized religion which was the same devil it was the same spiritual devil that was that they because what is what is a denominational idea against the Word of God is committing spiritual fornication because what you're doing is you're saying you're making love to God and you're actually making love to the devil and they're right man so what happens to that though that demon says I'm not going to stay there I want to come out and I'm gonna manifest it in the body yes right good watch and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman Paul picked that spirit up he picked it up and knew what was happening burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was me and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind in other words God knew they were going to continue to do it he said all right go ahead because he knew they would change see we always have hoped but he knew they were gonna change so he just said okay go ahead believe what you wanted to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all that righteousness look where it took to a fornication hang weeding this covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents we see that now that all comes from let me be plain that all come from a denominational idea till this false doctrine against nightfall doctrine against God doesn't make these people do this but God said okay if you're gonna fill yourself up with something and it's not gonna be me there you go there's your list that's what you're gonna do because what Satan's gonna do he knew what that spirit was gonna do cuz well inventors of evil things this will be the parents without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection let's see what that would resume implacable it means literally without libation which usually accompanies a treaty truthless truce in other words they have no they have no hmm when God you know he gave what's the word I'm trying the same you know where's he give him covenants he gave us all covenants he gave his promises and things he just pulled them right out from under that promise collective three electric break the tree yeah doctors breakers unmerciful who knowing the judgment of God that they which commit such things now see he's talking about he's not talking about well I guess it leads you to that but when Paul talks about these people say you've got that's why I'd like to get in Paul's head Paul was seeing this with his own eyes then if you turn God away if you turn got away and try and start doing your unrighteousness I see these people that were once in church or that were once my friends or that was once my acquaintances this is now what they're doing so what he's saying is so God's going to give them a reprobate mind and turn them over to all these things on him who knowing the judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them I know words they associate with each other and you see that version was better thought together you know we don't you know I have pleasure with being here I'm on my brothers and sisters I use that pleasure of a places a man everybody outside we have we just had pleasure other places well that's what I'm saying that these people watch went to church these are not just people that grow up drunkards murderers whoremongers fornicator now they were once in truth because they took the truth of God and made it a righteousness remember these people hold the truth and look when they hold another righteousness you see what happened nothing you see it happen even in a nominal world you see people these people come in or don't be that's not a good you know that but why do they do it because they hold the truth of God and unrighteousness that's why that the breaking of these seals moves all that out of the way seems right and we no worries right we know what he's doing with it we know his tactic now brother Brown said one time he said we now have seen his excellent they did not have Satan's answer in Martin Luther's day they didn't have in Wesley state they did not have Satan century in the Pentecostal day they did not have all of Satan's answers but today because you know what there's only one question there's only one question left can we get this thing changed that's all everything else is done except this we got to get this thing changed that's it well actually we're preaching the resurrection I was thinking the other day in a resurrection gonna come before we change right but we are preaching the resurrection now cuz once we get all this deadness out of the way then the dead that we're in Christ they're in another dimension or gonna walk over into this dimensions then we which are alive and remain shall be changed right so we're preaching I think we're preaching the preaching the resurrection message now and then we're gonna do I believe we're preaching the resurrection message now and then one day the dad's gonna just come among us that's right and then we go know then get all whole hell fix the break loose out there so I'm not worried about them I'm not worried about that but you know the poro 144,000 they're waiting on us no way no nuts they're over there into Israel been looking for what two thousand year while they've been looking for four thousand years for the Messiah being here the whole time and then finally their eyes are going to be open and we'll see that when we go on into the fifth seal in the sixth seal we're gonna see that Israel eyes are open but the fifth and sixth seal is gonna make our eyes like I said last Sunday God's got to get into the womb of our mind something that nobody on the face of this earth has ever faced he is a body change without dead you think you know I don't know in his way back in okay I'll I just by gonna I don't know about us today even jesus said that a man but he died so that we could live all right he died that we could change our body are not the stranger body but we do have something to do with money tank you can either reject it or exactly mister new you sit here and you know wear long dresses and long hair and go to a message church but you can I'm going to help in there right all right all right or bless you right for nothing he'll do the job I'm sure
