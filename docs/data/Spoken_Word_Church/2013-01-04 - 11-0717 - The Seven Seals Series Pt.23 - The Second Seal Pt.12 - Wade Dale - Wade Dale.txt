========================================

all right let's thank you wow let's get started um let's review this real quick before I erase it all right and then we're going to start on the second seal I hope we have uh got a little bit out of maybe the first seal yeah um I know that um that this mystery of iniquity is working we know it's in a man working out there but we got to realize it's in a man working in here this is where the mystery of iniquity that really matters is here when that when that man of sin see that Wicked one's made known in us but when that man of sin becomes incarnate on Earth we're out of here we're gone we if we see that we missed it okay so the literal opening of that seal showing the mystery of the man of iniquity uh we won't be here but we got to realize in a spiritual form we get these seals first in our Natural Body we must see that white horse rider riding away from our life all these little things like brother Tim was talking about this morning when he got hurt there's a few more things you have to deal with you don't just say out you might say something you don't need to say but guess what God's there one day one day just keep walking one one day all that'll just go away right okay some of them he took it away from us quicker some of us he takes it away longer that doesn't make you no better than me or me no better than you it's just like brother Tim said he's a work in progress and that's exactly what we all are we're all a work in progress all right but now there's got to come a time we can't just keep saying 10 years from now well I'm a work in progress I still got no they somewhere we're going to come we're going to see that mystery of iniquity is not in us anymore not that we're not going to have bad thoughts not that we're going to be totally uh what they call sinless Perfection but we are going to be a people that we realize we have no sin that's right we got to realize that okay remember what we talk about what God sees what God sees you never did Sin but now what we see here we sin every day but what God sees we never sin to start with that real you and when that real you comes to the outside and makes itself manifest that person didn't do it because if that person did do it and there's still a mark against you you're not born again all right you're lost and you're going to see this man of sin cuz he's going to chase you down and kill you just be honest during the during the tribulation period this man is going to have so much power brother BR said that foolish virgin group will be hunted down like dogs and killed for their stand for what they know you know um people that are Sanctified Justified and Sanctified but not filled with the Holy Ghost that's what that foolish virgin group is right because they're still virgins they took the word of God instead of man's ideas but they didn't go on to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why brother R said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the most important thing you can ever have in your life is that inside not not a knowledge of this Satan's got a knowledge of this right here he's standing here today looking through all your eyes looking at this right here and he said yeah know that's that that's that's that's what's going to happen but when we really have it manifested in our heart then that man can't reside here he's got to go here stands a lamb with a book in his hand there goes the white horse rider right here stands the Lamb with the book in his hand later on today and there goes the red horse rider all right and things like that but let's just go over this and make sure we got it first deal is the mystery of iniquity showing that there was a mystery of even our life even being born again there's a mystery of iniquity we do things we know we shouldn't do right amen we we do things we know we shouldn't do that's iniquity that's knowing not to do it and you do it anyway all right and then remember power was given to him by who the people the horse all see I'm going to leave these symbols but I'm going to race you know this part but always the horse is going to be a power so every horse regardless of what color he is is going to be a symbol of the people that he's riding on because without the people think about this in the Millennium in the Millennium Satan is going to be alive and well but brother Brown said he'll have no one to work through so he'll be bound there's no people to give him power cuz all the people in the millennium are the Born Again Believers and 144,000 so there's no one for him to work through so guess what what's the difference in now and then except for the glorified body there's no difference you're born again that theophany that's inside of you that's 20 years old that's what's going to walk over there in the Millennium walk out on the ashes of the wicked to rule and Reign Over the 144,000 is that correct so what's the difference we just got this body to deal with right now we'll have a sinless body then but we still got the same mind of Christ if you're born again you still got the same person we got to defeat him on this side right we can't wait actually we'll never get to the Millennium unless we defeat him on this side I like what brother F Fred Mullen said yesterday said everybody says we're waiting on God no God's waiting on us excuse me God's waiting on us to get this thing fulfilled all right and what happens we give this power to this horse and we let him ride through our life right most powerful scripture I told you last Sunday resist the devil and he'll flee from him that's right but no what we do is is we let him get on our horse that's right which gives him power to do what move we never let if we never let him get on the horse he can't move he's powerless Satan is powerless remember we read the scripture is this the man is this the person that made the Nations fall and crumble all right now remember he had a bow and no Arrow so that means he's a bluff he has no power unless the people give him that power all right then a crown was given him because remember when he first started out he was a saying a saying is not a person a saying was just a saying among the people well was Jesus God or was he a like substance of God or was he another person see that's what the old the everybody thinks we harp so much on this River Jordan Doctrine but they they've reverted right back to the Nan Council in 606 in this message that's where Satan wanted to mess us up is right here in the message he don't care about the people out in the denominational World he's got them already all right so he's wanting us and now he's got right back into the seat again and riding through the power of preachers that don't understand what the prophet was talking about because if Jesus was not God to the River Jordan he was a different substance right there was a substance came here and then God came into that substance that's two substances that's what they in nah 606 they agreed man agreed that God that Jesus was not the substance of God but a light substance I say he was the substance of God Flesh Blood the whole thing was God all right so that does away with that see so that we see that riding off in our life every time we we get a a revelation I'm not talking about head knowledge I'm talking about a true Revelation and that word goes together like this that person right there that Wicked one's being made known cuz he's residing telling you other things but when you get a revelation and it's locked right down into your soul and and nobody can talk you out of it that guy has got to right away from you you because he is in opposition he cannot stand you to get a revelation all right so Crown was given him because what he went from a saying just like in the message bunch of preachers sat around and said well was Jesus God or was he not God to the River Jordan he was just a man and then some argued said no he was God like me no he was God and other said no well he wasn't well you know what opposing forces but one day they crowned him they crowned that Doctrine and a preacher got up in a pull pit and preached it you said well that's that's bad well I'm not worried about a denominational preacher if he can make me doubt what I got you ain't got what you got if you listen to a denominational preacher and he can teach you more than this message can teach you you're lost you're just plainly lost I mean you can listen to them I don't even listen to them cuz they don't have nothing for me they not born again I don't want to hear them they Hy the preachers in this message ain't born again and I don't like to hear them either just be real honest with you but give me one good one that takes care of all the bad ones because remember God is also riding his power is in his people also and he's not riding away we're riding with him right here he's riding through here all right then also we saw that Christ lamb and the Holy Ghost there's a real true revelation of one God because brother R said if you see one in opposition you know that's not God see so that's what they've done at the River Jordan they separated him divide and conquer they've done just like the pope divide and conquer Jesus wasn't God he was a separate identity from God no he wasn't he was God are the biggest liar that there ever was when he said I and my father are one not like one right right and the Bible says like I told you the Holy One of Israel there's only one all right the combat Beast that went forth and said come and see was a lion the lion of the tribe of Judah real bold uh Peter Paul all them come out in the first three ages Paul irenius Martin they were real staunch believers they believed in one true Living God they believed in water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but see when this age ended in 606 it started Into the Dark Ages well the Nan Council got so tied up in the Roman Catholic Doctrine and all the other doctrines of the world that everybody accepted Father Son and Holy Ghost everybody accepted the Trinity everybody accepted these doctrines all right so Satan he gets off of that horse he's already made the people white righteous people we got it we got a pope I tell we was talking the other day oh yesterday with a brother and that's exactly what we've done in the message if we don't watch it we've made our preachers our our pastors our Pope brother Dale you go study for us and tell us what God Said you go you go I can't get prayed for by nobody else with brother Dale now if you got confidence in brother Dale that's a difference but if you're expecting him to do all your work you've made him a PO cuz what do they do they go what does the Catholic people do they live like the devil during the week they go up there and they do that whatever they do and they the pre gives them the wafer literally changes they say that to the Flesh of Jesus Christ and they drink the wine they don't give you the Holy Ghost they they're the Holy Ghost they're your Holy Ghost that's a pope a pope there sister an she'll tell you the pope is your holy ghost in the Catholic Church you don't get it you don't read nothing the pope gets up and reads it all or don't say Pope but the priest the priest does it all for you let's don't let the people in the message be the same way the Bible says study to show yourself approved it doesn't say study not study and let your pastor study to show you approved no you got to show yourself approved all right cuz I guarantee it's a lot easier to preach to a group of people that is studying than to preach to a bunch of people that's not trust me I've been to both places but the first three ages Paul irenius and Martin they held to the true word of God all right the wicked one now is being made known it wasn't really made known back then then like it is now cuz a lot of people accept it because look the next age is the fourth age right Columba priest Luther Catholic priest see how the Catholic church had already instituted so many things but when we get into this fourth age we're going to see that that horse rode through he got off of the white horse got on a red horse brother R said the reason he got on that red horse was is because he physically killed 68 million Protestants during that 4th age that's what we're going to get into all right and then he said Untold billions spiritually killed and that's the truth but this is your this is your basis for your first seal like I told you before I'm not here to to give you Revelation you got to get one yourself right right uh and study it listen dad preached this in 1983 I studied it wrote notes off of it several years ago and then I'm trying to go back to it a little bit now and you get a little more like brother collie said this morning he he's been listening to the series and he's got more out of it than he did in 1983 well that's not a that's not a dish on brother Dale and a and a crown to me no that just means brother collie m is getting a revelation the words was already spoke these words don't change right right but when you get a revelation that's yours and and and if if Paul was sitting here he'd say amen I don't care who wrote this cuz it's word it's the word of God to me right but God had to use somebody like Paul use somebody like Peter use somebody like Matthew Mark Luke and John to get the gospel out like brother Fred Mullen said it's it's God speaking he just chose to use them to do the speaking through all right so that's what happened here it doesn't matter to me that Paul wrote Romans or Hebrews or whatever those things you know that that Scholars back it's it's God speaking to me God spoke through Paul God spoke through brother brandom and then he spoke directly to me right cuz see people made brother random poke well all this happened to brother randam so we need to look to him it says in the days of the voice and there's only one voice of the seventh angel and that's the bride the bride is the final voice of the final AG under her messenger which was brother brandham started it all and brought this mystery of iniquity to us showing us that it wasn't just the white horse rider was the Antichrist but the white horse riders the Antichrist riding in your life in my life every single day all right the power was given so let's do one thing for sure let's confess this until it happens like brother Fred Mullen said yesterday really enjoyed that he said he said if you don't confess it God's not obligated to make it come to pass right and he's not CU he said by your words you will be justified but by your words you'll be condemned and confess with your mouth and believe in your heart and guess what God can move because that's what's written in the Bible but if you say no I can't do this I don't know anything and I can't do this then you can't you won't you can't bring your body under subjection if you don't listen to the inside teacher that inside man has got to have preeminence all right like this this man right here is going to get preeminence from this guy Satan is going to enter this Pope and and take over and he's going to be a a hard man to deal with because he's going to have Supernatural Powers that's what's going to make him strong he's going to have Supernatural powers and they're going to think he's God incarnate but he's not he's the devil incarnate because of what his Doctrine his Doctrine is what's going to tear him down signs and wonders folks we can have them all day long but listen to the message that goes with it the message that goes with it is right you listen to it the message does not go with it get away from it right so there's your first seal so now let's go let's read the second seal anybody have any questions I said was going to take maybe a little question and answer session does anybody have any questions on the first seal so the devil won have any power in theum is it because he's bound or he will have no power because he can't work in us how about the wicked people in the world do what how about the Sinners there won't be any sinners in the Millennium no only in the Millennium will be the bride and 144,000 now there's a group in there that I don't understand brother R said the Heathen will be preached to in the Millennium I don't know but I know one thing for sure Satan will not be able to work in me and you cuz Hey listen folks when we stand in the millenum this is after the battle of Armageddon there's nobody alive that we know of except the bride which is already sealed in we've already took our body changed we get our body changed right here right before the Millennium starts right now the 144,000 they get theirs later on because they get killed while we're at the marriage supper they get killed for the 3 and 1/2 years of the Daniel 70 weeks they get killed during that Ministry of the two prophets Moses and Elijah they get killed they go in a Rapture and then we all come back in the Millennium after because remember the Millennium is still in time that is not the fire of God to kill all Soul cuz God's the only one that can kill Soul they can't kill Soul right God's the only one cuz remember he said All Souls are mine Don't Fear the one that can kill the body he said fear the one that can kill the soul that's right all right so All Souls are mine see even during the Millennium during the Millennium people are going to be dead in The Fifth Dimension their bodies are going to be Ash because this is not going to be God's fire this will be man's fire just like man destroyed the Earth in Noah's age man is going to destroy brother Brown that atomic explosion will rock the will rock the whole world what it's doing is it's moving us back to the real condition because in Noah's age remember the Earth tilted off of its axis because of all the uh explosion that went on during that time but now what's happening now even with the earthquakes remember the earthquake the other day in Japan moved us back on our axis so many milliseconds a day well that don't mean nothing to to most of us we didn't feel it but if you're spiritually minded you'll know God's doing something he's putting it back he didn't knock it on off he's putting it back cuz when we get in the Millennium I believe it's going to rock right back up cuz Atomic explosions they're going to explode and it's going to kill everybody but see remember in the Millennium is not the future home in the Millennium we buil houses and inhabit them and plant Vineyards and plant Gardens and all the things like that last Sunday afternoon remember I read you the scripture Joshua went into that promised land and he said I give God said I give you houses you didn't build I give you venard that you didn't build I give you places you didn't build what that's the future home that's when God went prepared for us not us see when we come back here in the Millennium when we come back in the Millennium this is my thoughts we're just going to walk back on a wasteland if you ever seen these movies about all the uh after the apocalypse I believe that's what it's going to look like you're going to see still still see buildings standing up why not because remember this is man's fire this is the atomic explosion killing all the people it says we'll walk out on the ashes of the wicked now if you believe the Bible then you're going to walk out on the ashes of something there's ashes going to be on the ground but remember you and I are glorified we're already in etern we don't there's nothing going to harm us if they even if they even shot us with 10 nuclear bombs they would not hurt us because we're going to be changed right here same way with 144,000 soes everybody understand that when we get back here from on the mill in the Millennium I believe this just me I believe it says we'll build houses what's going to happen is it's going to be just like when Noah came off of that Ark everything started Greening up he said go and multiply and replace the Earth everything started Greening back up again right cuz it was still in time the Millennium is still in time it you got a man has to live a thousand years to show the Bible is correct so brother Brandon said you're still in time we're going to be still in time until the future home so we're still going to have day and night and all these things it's not going to harm us you think it's going to bother us to be there and and and um you said well that's a nuclear Wasteland what's it going to bother us we're already glorified bodies but I believe the Millennium is going to teach us a that this thing is coming back together correctly you know I'm just a human if God just dropped the future home down on us like a bombshell and we walked out in this beautiful place that we never had anything to do with it blow our mind but I believe that God's going to we're going to have a marriage supper God's going to bring us right back down into this Dimension after they blow everything up and you're going to see there's going to be cars and streets and but I mean it's not going to be runable I'm talking about it's going to be a wasteland it says the ashes you walk out on the ashes of the wicked so it's not going to be don't get me wrong but it's not going to be a beautiful place I just don't think so cuz a millennium is for a thousand years that somebody's going to live a thousand years to show that the sin curse is gone right because this is not the future home read your Bible in Isaiah it says we'll build houses and inhabit them how I none of my business I know I won't have to I'll just speak the thing into existence but you got 144,000 there maybe some other people that make it I don't I don't understand all that but the Millennium remember this one thing Millennium is still in time you it's not Eternity for the Earth not yet but it's going toward that because after we lived a thousand years after the thousand years is over the Bible tells us that Satan is loose for a season season I don't know what a season is it doesn't really matter remember we're in eternity he's not going to bother us but what it's doing people it's getting this Earth in order for us to come back on it with God and that future home sitting on this Earth everybody understand that Millennium is in time there is things that you cannot put in the scripture over in the future home there's things you put in the scripture for the Millennium but you can talk about both but now there's one thing for sure we're not going to build that future home no one has touched that future home except God himself and when that City comes down everything's going to be in order you've in between all this you've got a white Throne judgment right millennium Satan is loose for a season everybody understand this you've got a battle of Gog and Magog which there in right in there you're going to have your white Throne judgment cuz you're going to be judged the people are going to be raised up all the people of the world that's died without Christ is going to be raised up and have to go before God in the white Throne judgment and be judged that's where your Bible says divided between the sheep and the goats all right that's where the guy that that change your tire or the guy that give you a cup of water for no other purpose than just to be kind to you that's where you're going to see that man walk up and him walk away to go into judgment and um we're going to be able to say excuse me Lord you said in your word that it if they would do this that it wouldn't be forgotten here Jesus said it won't be forgotten here are there right here are there so there is where we'll be so if we're standing there you just remind God he don't mind you reminding him just remind God said hey that man changed my so would that be the Heathen that he was talking about no no the Heathen is something something no the the one Throne judgment is every other individual that's ever lived on the face of the Earth is going to have to give an account and that's going to be the man that like I said changes your tire uh or the man that gives you you know a ride somewhere or helps you out you just say excuse me Lord I remember when this person did this for me he said oh yeah enter into the joy of the Lord that's where that says enter into the joy of the Lord cuz he tells us that here when we get a body change we don't need to be told to enter into the joy of the Lord when you're born again you've entered into the joy of the Lord you got to remember one thing that guy may be a rank sinner he may be a wher have 15 wives but you're the one that's going to impart eternal life to him and then you're going to get to tell him about Jesus Christ you're going to get to tell him why he got eternal life not because of great me no but because of what was living inside of me he was good to me and Jesus said I'll not ever forget it here or there so there's where the white thr judgment in and then the Battle of Gog and Magog now the Battle of Gog and Magog is not man's fire that's God's fire that's right that's the fire of God that's when the souls will be burnt up put into the put into the Smoking Pit all right everybody understand that that's when you got your real separation that's when everything's done we're fixing to go into eternity then the whole earth remember the the the brother R said the mountain pushes up over there in Palestine and the city comes down now that City we've never seen that City we've never had to build that city was built by God you if you read the future home I wouldn't have to sit here and do this for 20 minutes I'm sorry I'm just being plain if you read the future home it exactly tells you exactly what I just said okay so go back and read the future home again if you haven't read it then you should have read it already or listen to the tape but does everybody understand now always remember one thing to keep them separate the Millennium is in time there are still there are still things that can happen Happ future home is done everything is eternal from the solar system all the way down to the middle of Earth it's Eternal you never have to build another house worry about Satan anymore of course we don't but I'm talking about the whole world the Earth cuz remember we're part of the earth the earth comes after we do whatever happens to us see because we get a fiery baptism at the Holy Ghost right right we get a fire baptism that burns out all the old you all right that's the first fire right then we're going to get a fiery baptism like Gog and Magog and it's not going to kill our soul it's going to change our body right God's fire is going to come down and burn Mama and Daddy's part of this away you understand we're not going it's not going to brother R said your your Rob will drop off it's not you're not going to be like a uh what's those things that change that apens and whatever that come out of the shell and you see the shell cicada a cicada everybody seen those little bugs on the side of the trees that that inside it made a new bug and it popped out that that piece is going to Ste no we're not going to have bodies laying around somewhere God's going to just change these atoms right here see that's the great mystery that this thing's going to be changed right here this thing the one that you live in right now is going to be changed to a 20-year old person and then what's going to happen to the earth the earth is going to follow because see remember this is Earth this is where the curse started right right the the curse started with man getting cursed then God said I'm cursing the Earth right so he's got to take that sin curse off the Earth so he's taking a sin curse off of this Earth he's not getting a new one not a new Earth but brother random said what going to burn off cuz remember the Holy Ghost burns your soul it doesn't burn your body but now remember your body's going to come into subjection but he's going to take that new heaven before the new Heaven and new earth before the new Heaven and new earth comes right was she asleep no before the you before the new Heaven and new earth comes you're going to get a new Heaven and a new Earth not new like in this one done away and you getting no you understand what I'm saying yes you'll be made new right this will be burnt Mama and Daddy's genetics will be burnt out of this man right here right and I'll not be the son of Samuel and Peggy Dale anymore but that's going to happen here that's why I see don't worry about what the Millennium goes on in the Millennium I have never worried about people sit down and and and worry about what we're going to eat what we're how just get there that's right just get there it's too much information going through our head sometime you know are we going to have cows there they going to you know I've heard them say well are they going to all cows are they going to I mean animals are they going to repr I don't care OWC for those of you on the internet OWC means oh who cares and really don't get caught up in stuff like this just remember two basic things in the Millennium there's still time and things can happen that's not going to happen in a future home Millennium is going to be the fire of man kill off and burn this Earth because we're going to come right back down here and live for a th000 years years well in th000 years look hey look at America um well look at 2,000 years ago 2,000 years ago Jesus was here and there was nobody on the Earth but look how it's grown in 2,000 years look how it's grown in 100 years look how the United States went from Indians 250 years ago to look at what we populate in just 250 years now there's one thing for sure we're not going to have babies and have relations with our wife and all this stuff that's going to be gone that curse is going to be took care of right here everybody understand that so in the but in the Millennium we build houses you say well we're going to get tight don't worry about it don't worry who's going to build and who's going to inhabit just give me a rock to sit on for a th years what what's that going to make what's that going to bother me and you but there's things that's got to happen to other people right let's just remember one thing the Bride of Jesus Christ is sealed in with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when that fire comes down and burns out this old man and I become a 20-y old again once my body's changed here there's nothing in the world of the world or this world is going to bother this man right here but we still have to go through the steps of going into the Millennium with the 144,000 and with the Heathen wherever how that is you got just one quote by Brother brown but ever how that transpires remember when one thing you and I are glorified there's no way we're going to change we're going to be no different we're still going to be the same people that we were when we were changed on this side the dead saints that come up once they're changed there's no there's no more movement for me and you we have become God incarnate on the earth because remember when we go up that's what helps this guy become an incarnate poet he sees how God incarnates me and you and we go out of here and he comes down here he can't stand being up there he's got he wants to be down here and incarnate in a pole but let's not worry about those things if you're born again free ticket but I want to be born again and changed here and not have to go down into this Earth and be buried right I don't want that to happen I'm saying I'm not going to die but if I do I'm going to come up and I'm going to be changed before you guys are if you're still here and I'm going to be over there in the sixth Dimension going come on come on I'm like brother Fred mull you know I I want to be in the front of the line just being competitive you know I want to be in the front I want be the first one changed right but he said I really don't care if I'm a last one changed either long as I'm changed so okay I know you said that you don't understand the part about the he but like in in the Millennium sense we're still going to be in time and the Heen going to be there could that be like our fam some of our families that we could we'll be able to talk to them no we'll be able to talk who what I'm saying are they going to have do you think since you don't know for sure that they will have the opportunity to no there's just there's just there's one quote one quote brother Brown says about Heathen being raised up in the Millennium and being told of Jesus Christ now I don't know if that's somebody off in the hot tops of Africa but listen let me make one thing plain family or not if you're not born again when the Rapture takes place you're not going to be here during the Millennium that's right period That's Right period period you're dead and you going to come up in that white Throne judgment and you you going to be judged for what you've done period there's no God's not going to be now he may give you your family at the white Throne judgment but they're not going to to receive any blessing they're going to be in that Fifth Dimension that falling hideous horrible place until they come up in the white Throne judgment and then they can be given eternal life but not during that Millennium that Millennium is you and I let me let me just make this real plain the Millennium is our vacation you know you go and you go on a honeymoon you consummate the marriage and you don't turn around and go back home some of you may have but usually you take about a week off you know kind of enjoy yourself and go somewhere and take a cruise well you know what we're going to take a Thousand-Year Cruise we're going to be able to travel like a thought we're going to be unlimited now the earth I know I'm getting long but the Earth and everything else is going to be limited to days and times and Seasons cuz it's still going to be in time we're still going to have a 24-hour day but you and I are not you and I could go set on the moon and talk if we wanted to during that time we're unlimited but everybody else is limited because look we go first and then the Earth's got to catch up that's what I said about the Millennium if they wasn't the Millennium there the Earth would have to do it real fast and God can do that but he does it the way it got off kilter he's got to put it back into kilter right no preached 120 years flood happened all these things went went on there was a lapse of time well this is going to be a lapse of time that but you and I are going to be on an absolute rest of a honeymoon we not going to have to worry about nobody else if there is somebody raised up in the Millennium guess what they got to know about Jesus Christ somebody's got to tell them but it will not be anybody that knows anything about Jesus Christ will have to die and be judged later okay so don't get you hoped up it won't be anybody you know I don't think well I don't I don't know don't think I know it won't be all right let's go we'll start on the second seal next then the next Sunday you're going to get a treat for those of you that are still here brother Bob Black's going
