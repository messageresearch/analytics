[20:25] and we just ask you now to bless and
[20:27] guide each one as we read your word you
[20:30] come and speak to our hearts and deliver
[20:33] us from ourselves and plantiffs Lord
[20:35] into your word because that's our desire
[20:37] more than anything forgive us of our
[20:39] many failures because we know we fail
[20:41] you and just cover us by the blood Lord
[20:45] we need you so much just have your way
[20:48] save the lost lord heal the sick and
[20:51] deliver those that are downhearted
[20:54] because you promised it you said you'd
[20:56] send your word and heal us and deliver
[20:58] us from destruction so we can depend on
[21:01] it have your way now as we talk about
[21:03] you in your word Lord in Jesus name and
[21:08] the weight will be ministering this
[21:11] afternoon so getting him back in through
[21:14] the rains and probably if he wants to we
[21:17] can take winds to you that'll pull him
[21:19] over and give him an extra time in
[21:22] before the rush time starts okay does it
[21:29] feel quite a while that won't be nobody
[21:30] ministering but business persons like
[21:32] that we appreciate it all right
[21:36] tisha I mean excuse me Peter 1:22
[21:48] seeing you have purified your souls in
[21:51] obeying the truth through the spirit
[21:52] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[21:56] that you love one another with a pure
[21:58] heart fervently being born again not of
[22:02] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[22:05] the Word of God which liveth and abideth
[22:08] for ever alright now let's go to
[22:11] Ephesians 4 verse start with verse 7 but
[22:18] unto every one of us is given grace
[22:21] according to the measure of the gift of
[22:24] Christ
[22:24] now that's written down there's we're
[22:28] not all the same it's according to the
[22:30] measure of the gift of Christ alright
[22:32] now what's that you read the scriptures
[22:38] we read them for so long trying to make
[22:43] sure that we read things you know and
[22:46] didn't leave loophole because we were
[22:49] studying the Godhead and we were trying
[22:51] to get it all in order and getting
[22:52] everything lined up and we're going to
[22:54] say everything right you know but we
[22:57] found out the word of gods right anyway
[22:59] but then just listen to the thought now
[23:05] to the measure of the gift of Christ
[23:08] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[23:11] on high he led captivity captive and
[23:14] gave gifts unto men now that he ascended
[23:19] what is it but that he also descended
[23:21] first into the lower parts of the earth
[23:25] he that descended is the same also that
[23:28] ascended up far above all heavens that
[23:31] he might fill all things and he gave now
[23:34] what what did he give back here he gave
[23:36] gifts what did he give and he gave some
[23:39] apostles some prophets some evangelists
[23:43] some pastors and teachers so he gave
[23:47] that to the bride now what for for the
[23:50] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[23:53] the ministry for the edifying of the
[23:55] body of Christ
[23:56] till our until we come into the unity of
[24:01] the
[24:01] faith and the knowledge of the Son of
[24:03] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[24:06] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[24:08] that we henceforth be no more children
[24:10] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[24:13] every wind of doctrine by the sleight of
[24:16] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[24:19] lie in wait to deceive but speaking the
[24:22] truth in love may grow up once now being
[24:25] born again may grow up into him in all
[24:29] things which is the head even Christ
[24:31] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[24:34] together and compacted by that which
[24:38] every joint supplies according to the
[24:41] effectual working in the measure of
[24:44] every part making a nurse in crease of
[24:47] the body unto the edifying of itself in
[24:50] love now they don't have this for put up
[24:52] on the screen but I want us to read
[24:56] verses 8 and 9 back over again then pick
[25:01] up another scripture wherefore he saith
[25:04] when he ascended up on up on high he now
[25:08] who's just talking about who send it up
[25:13] the cross the Lord Jesus Christ right
[25:17] that's what I said we we shouldn't have
[25:20] to say now wait a minute I'm not a
[25:21] Trinitarian you know we ought to
[25:24] understand that enough to listen to
[25:26] what's said without saying well what he
[25:29] says that can sound like a Trinity see
[25:31] he more for he says when he let when he
[25:35] ascended up on a high
[25:37] he who the Lord Jesus Christ the one is
[25:40] recent read down here that descended and
[25:42] everything else all right and he led
[25:45] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[25:47] men now this one that ascended gave
[25:54] gifts unto men now where did he get to
[26:00] give them now they don't have it but if
[26:06] they can snatch real quick and maybe
[26:07] they can pull it up we're going to
[26:09] Psalms 68
[26:12] in verse 18 look what it says thou has
[26:18] descended on high thou has led captivity
[26:23] captive thou has received gifts for men
[26:30] now listen
[26:32] yay for the rebellious also that the
[26:35] Lord God might dwell among them
[26:38] now we know the gifts and callings of
[26:40] God her out without repentance but think
[26:42] about what it's saying thou has ascended
[26:44] up on high thou has led captivity
[26:46] captive thou has received gifts for men
[26:50] all right now here he says he gives
[26:53] gifts so if he gave gifts he had to
[26:58] receive them so how did he get those
[27:01] gifts where do they come from and what
[27:03] is it so we'll think on these things
[27:07] father we just commit it to you now that
[27:10] your loving grace be with us in Jesus
[27:13] name Amen you may be seated now I've
[27:16] tried to explain without you know trying
[27:24] to stir controversy old situations or
[27:27] thoughts or ideas but I've tried to
[27:29] express something to you in the life's
[27:33] three services and I want to make sure
[27:37] you follow that today and then when we
[27:40] get back into ministering then we'll
[27:41] pick up on the virtues and start going
[27:44] what is this and what is that and
[27:46] studying the things like that to go
[27:50] along but see I want you to think about
[27:53] it
[27:53] he had to get those gifts and then he
[27:58] could give them who is it a he see the
[28:02] Lord Jesus Christ Himself ascended on
[28:06] high and he gave gifts word two gifts
[28:09] don't get the gifts come from Almighty
[28:11] God
[28:12] now that was what I was trying to get
[28:14] across Wednesday night it and I would
[28:16] ask you if you wasn't here to listen to
[28:19] that message because I tried my best to
[28:22] pour out my heart to you to let you
[28:25] understand
[28:26] a little bit of what we're saying coach
[28:29] now we're going to read some today I've
[28:33] skipped over it hadn't been reading but
[28:35] we'll read something but I wish you
[28:37] would just sometimes run in you know
[28:43] predestinated gifts run that in your
[28:47] computer run in ordained gifts or gifts
[28:51] that are ordained just put them together
[28:52] put ordaining gifts and get the gifts
[28:58] and callings are the route repentance
[29:00] but then just look at how many times
[29:02] brother Branham talks about the fivefold
[29:07] ministry is for the perfecting of the
[29:08] Saints this see how many times he says
[29:13] it what he's talking about so we're
[29:16] gonna read a little bit of it but I want
[29:18] you to understand what I'm getting at
[29:19] you know to the point see I believe that
[29:27] when the Lord Jesus Christ ascended on
[29:29] high then he sent back the baptism of
[29:34] the Holy Ghost to give us a new birth
[29:35] and then he said you shall receive power
[29:38] after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[29:40] you and you shall be my witnesses etc
[29:42] and everything he gave gifts he never
[29:47] just come back now he came back onto
[29:49] their Pentecost and gave the Holy Ghost
[29:51] as the gift of God which is eternal life
[29:54] through through Jesus Christ right
[29:56] that's the gift of God that's eternal
[29:59] life through Jesus Christ he gave that
[30:01] to 120 in the upper owned and he gave it
[30:04] to 3000 outside or not he gave eternal
[30:09] life the gift of eternal life
[30:14] all right now I see then that wouldn't
[30:19] all that he gave he gave gifts unto men
[30:27] all right you've got nine spiritual
[30:30] gifts in the the body of Christ and
[30:33] those nine spiritual gifts they can
[30:37] operate that's within the church they
[30:40] can
[30:40] right in brother on city got one of them
[30:43] speaking tongues or somebody interpreted
[30:44] whatever and never use it again it's
[30:47] just one time all right and he's
[30:50] explaining those gifts like that to her
[30:53] that the nine spiritual gifts is what it
[30:56] says when it says seek you the best gift
[30:59] because you can seek that you know you
[31:02] can seek that in the body you as laity
[31:05] can seek God for him to give you gifts
[31:09] and you've got wisdom knowledge all kind
[31:13] of things we'll get into the statue of
[31:14] perfect man and you'll see that this
[31:17] will be very valuable to that point to
[31:19] her then when we start talking about
[31:21] what these things are we need to seek
[31:24] God for the virtues brother Dale I read
[31:30] where is the automatic you know
[31:31] automatic is not an automatic like you
[31:35] think because it ain't automatic to give
[31:38] it to everybody in the world it's only
[31:42] for the bride the virtues in the thing
[31:45] all right we'll get to that point but
[31:47] that's what I want you to think about it
[31:49] and keep in your mind that there's nine
[31:52] spiritual gifts in the operation of the
[31:54] church
[31:55] you got tongues interpretation you got
[31:57] all kind of thing knowledge wisdom
[31:59] you've got the nine spiritual guilt and
[32:03] that can move from one person to another
[32:05] one and God usually and never use you
[32:08] again but it's gifts all right that's
[32:12] what he gives so gifts and callings are
[32:14] without repentance so you can have those
[32:17] gifts without repenting but when you
[32:20] repent and you come to Christ I wish
[32:23] you'd think on this let's see when you a
[32:25] preacher as a preacher I mean you know
[32:29] if you was preacher if you ever be a
[32:30] preacher get ordained before the
[32:32] foundation in the world all right but
[32:35] yet when you come into the world you
[32:37] don't have another thing in order and
[32:39] what it takes it takes the new birth to
[32:42] even put us in line you may have had
[32:46] discernment I remember one brother
[32:47] telling it that he was a bouncer in a
[32:52] bar in a sinful life you know
[32:54] that he would detect things that were
[32:57] fixed in a start plate taking place you
[32:59] know
[33:00] fights and different things problem and
[33:02] he'd go break it up because that was
[33:06] part of his gift
[33:08] so gifts and callings are without
[33:10] repentance you have a gift you had that
[33:12] gift all alone you're born with that
[33:15] gift but that's just in the point of not
[33:18] giving you eternal life well you say can
[33:20] you have the gifts and not have you turn
[33:23] yes you can have the gifts and not have
[33:25] eternal life but if you have the giver
[33:29] why not want the giver I want the giver
[33:33] the gifts go with the giver whether it
[33:36] be design spiritual gifts or whether it
[33:39] be five offices of God in the fivefold
[33:43] ministry I want the giver then I don't
[33:47] have to worry about the gifts but just
[33:50] trying to define what the Prophet said
[33:52] in the nine spiritual gifts you can seek
[33:55] gifts but you don't seek to be a
[33:57] preacher the you're either called before
[34:01] the foundation of the world you're not
[34:02] called alright and see you don't go
[34:06] around trying to seek a gift or pray for
[34:08] it like I've always tried to explain to
[34:10] you
[34:11] you see a lot of young ministers come up
[34:13] they don't have anything they're there
[34:16] they're in their church and they're
[34:17] working the best they can do and and
[34:18] they begin to get this called seem like
[34:21] on their life well to me it was just God
[34:23] calling them to move up in him because
[34:25] he he or to call all of us statue of a
[34:27] perfect man he ought to call the
[34:29] minister first that's his honest name
[34:32] say it we need to call them first
[34:34] because you can't teach others how to be
[34:36] if you ain't got it yourself alright
[34:38] what you see well I've seen a lot of
[34:40] ministers and I've seen it in this
[34:42] message especially young ones move out
[34:45] and you know and then the ministry
[34:47] alright then after a while they just
[34:49] fall away well to me I don't believe God
[34:52] was calling them for a ministry I
[34:54] believe he was calling them to a closer
[34:56] walk with him but they don't understand
[34:59] because they've not been taught they
[35:01] don't know what a calling is the a
[35:05] calling is not a rooster crowing up in a
[35:07] tree
[35:08] yeah you say yeah but I heard voices
[35:11] that's fine I heard this I heard that
[35:14] that's fine but you don't hear Paul
[35:17] saying now Paul said his called to the
[35:20] ministry he said was the word he was to
[35:23] bring the engrafting of the gentiles the
[35:26] mysteries going on from dark into the
[35:28] opening of the word and he said that was
[35:30] his call he said where of I'm called so
[35:36] I believe if ministers a minister they
[35:38] have a part I've tried to explain this
[35:40] to the ministry
[35:41] I believe you have a certain scriptures
[35:43] that are relate to you that will be as
[35:47] part of your life and ministry I believe
[35:49] that because I know what's happened in
[35:52] my own life and what is done and what
[35:54] takes place on earth but see try to get
[35:57] other people to see what you're talking
[35:59] about in the gifts with them not having
[36:02] the gifts that you know well I believe
[36:06] that brother so-and-so don't you think
[36:08] you'll just put him in let him preach
[36:09] he's he's got to call to this now don't
[36:12] run him off you gonna do anything run
[36:16] him off if you want to be a blessing to
[36:19] him and God run him off oh you're you
[36:23] know I don't understand you you know you
[36:26] don't understand me at all because you
[36:27] don't understand God calling somebody
[36:29] don't you worry about it
[36:31] if your call just called before the
[36:35] foundation in the world
[36:37] yeah but brother Dale that's just
[36:39] prophets well I'm glad brother Branham
[36:41] that's why I want you to read the things
[36:42] he said because I know what he's talking
[36:44] about at a profit and how profit is
[36:46] called and and everything but he puts
[36:48] the fivefold ministry right into that
[36:51] same order of calling as he does the
[36:54] profit to be brought well see we
[37:01] understand why brother Branham come to
[37:03] brain the word that was his call to
[37:06] preach but see then we go out and you
[37:09] see them you see ministers go out and
[37:11] they got just and they're really going
[37:12] and everything's working pretty good all
[37:14] right Wanda and all it wants to start
[37:15] falling away I mean are you loose and
[37:18] you know there's God start out on
[37:21] something
[37:22] yeah no you find scrap heaps along the
[37:27] way because they thank their called to
[37:30] preach when maybe they're called to move
[37:32] up in God
[37:33] maybe call to do some work brother enema
[37:36] I've read these over and over and
[37:38] studying them for weeks now
[37:39] and he talks about that you just have
[37:42] gifts and the non spiritual gifts you
[37:45] can do you get a burden on your heart
[37:48] right how many times have you heard me
[37:50] to tell you you get a burden on your
[37:52] heart for somebody pray for them because
[37:54] God is using you to pray and intercede
[37:57] well right that's gives that's not
[38:03] called to preach as gifts but something
[38:07] God put on you to give you and you had
[38:09] it before the world that's where we we
[38:13] need to get that understanding of the
[38:16] scriptures to line it up and see as I
[38:19] said now you got 9 spiritual gifts
[38:22] operating in the body of Christ but
[38:27] you've got a five fold ministry that's
[38:31] predestinated offices now we're quick to
[38:37] use in our explanation that it's not God
[38:41] in three person it's God in three
[38:44] offices right hey power comes off answer
[38:51] it'll come back on so when it does we're
[38:55] gonna be in a bar back there with the
[38:57] computers all right but we'll go ahead
[39:00] we just have to forget that part
[39:03] alright but now listen you understand
[39:07] what I'm getting at see the fivefold
[39:09] ministry is not this the gifts of the
[39:12] non spiritual gift that's for the local
[39:14] assembly that's for the body of Christ
[39:16] in that short working in that church
[39:18] with the five fold ministry God has
[39:21] called them for a special two to make me
[39:24] say in time that'll be between you and
[39:26] God
[39:26] do you realize that our whole dependence
[39:31] has got to be number one on this message
[39:33] being the truth
[39:35] no it ain't of choice for this another
[39:41] the other it's a fact if that's not true
[39:45] then you and I on bad shape but if it is
[39:49] true and that God has moved into stage
[39:52] two of his journey and let the fivefold
[39:54] ministry preach to the people but for
[40:03] the people to believe who they are is
[40:07] that the words of the Prophet when the
[40:09] bride come on musician we do have a
[40:11] little bit now in do you realize that
[40:17] you and I are sitting on the greatest
[40:20] opportunity the world has ever seen
[40:22] for a group of people to actually hear
[40:26] from God and as I stay in there then to
[40:29] what is it when the bride realized at
[40:33] who she is and what she's here for
[40:37] she'll be gone but see we said but we've
[40:42] got to do this we got to do that
[40:44] it's alright but we need to check some
[40:48] of our goddess to do the cold I've seen
[40:52] a lot of people run after these young
[40:54] ministers especially and they're moving
[40:57] Xand the gifts they have and their signs
[40:59] and wonders and they've run out of them
[41:01] like crazy and it run out there for a
[41:03] little while and then they come floating
[41:05] back I'm not throwing off on nobody for
[41:06] doing that I mean saying no problem I'm
[41:10] just saying thank God if they kind of
[41:12] caught on to the truth but it's not the
[41:16] signs and the wonders is supposed to be
[41:18] I thought it was the word I thought you
[41:22] was to check anybody by the word that
[41:25] they was bringing alright see there next
[41:28] to five for ministry what do you realize
[41:31] church where a minister stands that's
[41:34] why you think that brother tells us that
[41:35] no no you realize where the ministry
[41:39] stands
[41:43] will be unto me if I don't preach the
[41:45] truth you realize you could make it not
[41:54] miss it because of some preconceived
[41:57] thought or idea that I had but you could
[42:03] have your heart right in God and things
[42:04] could work but I'm telling you straight
[42:07] as I can tell you brother branham
[42:08] brought the message but now we got to
[42:10] depend on the fivefold ministry to break
[42:13] that down he said some of it you know
[42:16] like big nuggets and then you're
[42:18] breaking it on down into smaller alright
[42:21] that's not a direct quote that's a
[42:23] problem that's a paraphrase quote from a
[42:25] lot of us ministers cuz if I can't find
[42:28] it tour but I know what he's talking
[42:30] about he's talking about the word has to
[42:36] be brought to us and if that man would
[42:44] stand and listen to ministers minister
[42:47] and say thank God for that ministry
[42:52] right but do we do that
[42:55] do you pray for the pastor you pray for
[42:59] these ministers I pray every day for
[43:02] these ministers do you pray for the
[43:06] pastor
[43:11] but do you pray in a line Lord help the
[43:14] pastor is sick and eat it or do you put
[43:16] it in there to finally
[43:17] Lord keep him straight on the word
[43:20] because my dependence is upon the word
[43:23] that he's bringing these ARS what gifts
[43:29] are you think about it this for a second
[43:33] I'm talking about a gift you know that
[43:35] what a gift is now God didn't that's
[43:41] what I was illustrating that to start
[43:42] with using it from Psalms - yeah Jesus
[43:50] is the working in the middle he got to
[43:53] give from God and he priced it to
[43:56] mankind
[43:57] that's not trinitarianism that's just
[44:00] terminologies words using to express the
[44:03] thought because he brought the ministry
[44:07] he chose them you never thought about
[44:11] was listening to the Bible being read
[44:15] and all you never thought about you got
[44:19] to put all the Gospels together you ever
[44:22] thought about what really happened give
[44:24] me a second here's Jesus walking down
[44:26] through there and there's Peter James
[44:27] and John they ain't never seen you they
[44:29] don't know who he is what's going on he
[44:31] watched he said come on follow me you
[44:36] know what Peter didn't get up and say
[44:40] let me go tell my mother I think my
[44:41] mother-in-law sick I better do that
[44:43] first let me go tell my wife but her her
[44:46] mother is sick and me and then I'll come
[44:49] follow you no he just got it walked but
[44:51] you see that's what one author wrote
[44:55] take the same situation over into one of
[44:59] the other writers you know Matthew Mark
[45:00] Luke and John they each one tell things
[45:03] it's a little bit different and then
[45:05] you'll see that Jesus comes along he has
[45:07] a great meeting Peter James and John is
[45:09] in the meeting they've heard they've
[45:11] listened they've seen the signs and
[45:14] wonders and when he said come follow me
[45:17] they knew where he was going what he's
[45:19] gonna do right what do you say it I'm
[45:23] saying it takes two five
[45:25] whole ministry it's not one Minister for
[45:28] the perfecting of the Saints there's no
[45:31] such thing
[45:31] brother Brown doesn't say your pastor
[45:34] he's does say we read them your pastor
[45:36] is ordained to lead you through if he's
[45:38] ordained I don't mind saying all that he
[45:41] says all right but you see there's got
[45:45] to be a fire phone can't do it for one
[45:51] you gotta have a fivefold ministry so he
[45:55] said Peter James John really checking
[45:58] you're doing Messiah I'm Matthew is the
[46:01] only one he director he spoke to to come
[46:05] follow me and there's no other
[46:06] explanation and the other three Gospel
[46:08] as to amount of time it's just like he
[46:11] said but you don't understand you don't
[46:13] read your Bible in the correct way I
[46:17] mean what if a man come walking right
[46:19] through here right now he's gonna said
[46:21] all right no Louise come on follow me
[46:26] well where are you going and what are we
[46:30] supposed to be doing and who's gonna
[46:33] feed us why are we doing all of this you
[46:35] know I mean they'd be a lot involved but
[46:37] it looks like Peter them just laid
[46:39] everything down walked off no go back to
[46:42] the other gospel I'm trying to
[46:44] illustrate a fivefold ministry where one
[46:47] of those would tell only parts read
[46:51] Matthew Mark Luke and John
[46:52] and just compare one to the other
[46:56] I like Luke reading I like him you know
[47:01] what he was not one of the original boy
[47:03] hell I said he wasn't around didn't hear
[47:07] things he wouldn't want a regional 12 I
[47:09] love him more he first starts off he
[47:14] says having perfect understanding he
[47:21] wasn't even one of the originally walked
[47:23] with the Lord Jesus but he had the Holy
[47:28] Ghost lady you see what I'm saying
[47:33] you got four Gospels telling the same
[47:35] account and each one is a little bit
[47:37] different now don't make them one
[47:38] contrary to the other one that ain't the
[47:42] point the point is you got one preacher
[47:45] comes in preaches one way one comes in
[47:47] preaches another way these three
[47:49] ministers here don't preach you're like
[47:51] the each one how their ministry and
[47:54] they're encouraged to do that not
[47:57] encouraged to follow me but to follow
[48:00] Jesus Christ in their own lives if they
[48:05] ain't man enough to get up one day and
[48:08] say brother Dale you're wrong then
[48:12] they're not a part of the five film
[48:13] industry if it's true that I'm home you
[48:19] get what I'm saying don't at least have
[48:21] enough trust in their own ministry to
[48:24] get up and say you're wrong okay
[48:29] because it's a fivefold ministry
[48:31] it ain't a one folk going one we got
[48:34] anybody have a need God let's just start
[48:38] out in the dark now in the light and
[48:40] sing about the original life those men
[48:42] are you God's attributes 376 G God's
[48:47] attributes were manifest
