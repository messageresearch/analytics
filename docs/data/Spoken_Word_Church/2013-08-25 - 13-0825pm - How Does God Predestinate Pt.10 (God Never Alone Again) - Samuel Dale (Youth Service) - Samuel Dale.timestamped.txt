[31:43] embarrassed and you know that thing die
[31:46] until I was 16 years old I was so
[31:49] embarrassed I couldn't even talk to
[31:51] anybody and if somebody could have
[31:53] helped me along the way you know maybe
[31:54] to let me get out and do a few things in
[31:56] the public and get where it helps you
[31:59] you know so really doing the kids good
[32:01] to just do that much and and all and
[32:04] it'll help them in their schoolings and
[32:05] our things to where they can you know
[32:07] get up and go and and everything and and
[32:10] realize hey there ain't nobody out there
[32:11] any better than you are but also
[32:14] remember you ain't no better than nobody
[32:15] else
[32:16] so we'd always remember things right
[32:18] amen let's just pray and go right into
[32:20] the word father we thank you for this
[32:23] day in your grace and to us thank you
[32:24] for the children Lord that are truly
[32:27] taken apart
[32:28] and doing their part of singing and
[32:30] worshiping and
[32:32] having a good time in you Lord we pray
[32:35] that you would just guide each and every
[32:36] one be with each one Lord be with those
[32:39] that are not with us today and may as
[32:40] they're watching May Lord Your Grace be
[32:43] there to express yourself unto each one
[32:46] we love you and we thank you and we
[32:48] commit it all to you now have your way
[32:50] in our hearts and our lives we love you
[32:52] we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us
[32:56] and keep us Lord in Jesus name
[33:01] Romans 8
[33:07] . and we know that all things work
[33:10] together for good to them that love God
[33:13] to them who are the called according to
[33:15] his purpose
[33:17] for whom he did for no he also did
[33:19] predestinate to be conformed to the
[33:22] image of his son that he might be the
[33:24] firstborn among many brethren
[33:27] moreover whom he did predestinate than
[33:30] he also called in whom he called him he
[33:33] also justified in whom he justified them
[33:36] he also glorified what shall we then say
[33:40] to these things if God be for us who can
[33:43] be against us he may be seated the Lord
[33:45] had his Blessing if God be for us who
[33:48] can keep this and taking place
[33:50] yeah
[33:51] if God saw a bride
[33:54] that would come to a place in a position
[33:56] to walk off of this Earth
[33:59] then all the gates of hell can't stop
[34:01] her I know that and I realize that the
[34:05] more each day as we go
[34:07] that you know it's all in his hands
[34:10] and everything but we we just appreciate
[34:12] it you know
[34:14] I joined to just make one comment
[34:16] Brother Gary and I was talking a little
[34:18] bit out there a while ago about
[34:20] something you know that I'm always
[34:22] saying and uh I know it's kind of a odd
[34:26] way and maybe a funny way but I'm kind
[34:28] of a funny Feller that seems kind of odd
[34:30] too so it all fits me anyway but we was
[34:33] talking about how that you know I've
[34:35] always said
[34:38] did God before the world see this
[34:41] or are we living exactly what he saw is
[34:43] this it
[34:45] you say well what would that have to do
[34:47] with it well if he saw this
[34:50] it's not something personal to him
[34:54] he could just stay up in heaven and
[34:56] forget it you know
[34:58] but if this is what he saw
[35:00] and he's now seeing it then it's
[35:03] something real and personal you realize
[35:06] that as we go along one of these days
[35:08] and get down to some thoughts about the
[35:10] Rapture you'll see that we've got to
[35:12] realize realization of what's right now
[35:16] me being back before the world there's
[35:18] no faith
[35:20] in me believing that I was before the
[35:22] world
[35:23] you may think well that just makes me
[35:25] feel so great good that's fine but
[35:27] there's no faith back there
[35:29] my faith is anchored right now
[35:33] in what I'm hearing
[35:35] and what I'm able to receive that's
[35:38] building it
[35:39] to the base that my faith is becoming
[35:42] more real
[35:44] you know more real I was thinking while
[35:47] ago thinking well you know a lot of
[35:49] people would be afraid to stand out as I
[35:52] do and just speak hard and straight but
[35:54] yeah I've got two things is to my
[35:57] advantage if I'm right everything's good
[35:59] shape
[36:01] if I'm wrong
[36:02] somebody can help me because at least
[36:04] I'm telling you what I believe
[36:06] if I tell you what I believe then I can
[36:08] have help somewhere down the road all
[36:10] right if I don't you know well I'm kind
[36:12] of maybe maybe that might be right I
[36:14] don't know about no no no it's this one
[36:16] boy ain't gonna do it like that I'm
[36:18] going to tell you what I believe
[36:19] and then we're going to go from dark
[36:22] and I won't have any troubles if you
[36:24] come up and say I don't believe you
[36:26] that's no problem to me
[36:28] you know because I just that's just up
[36:31] to the Lord to reveal not up to me all
[36:33] right now try not to spend too much time
[36:37] on background which I generally do a lot
[36:40] of times but
[36:41] I'm hoping that it's beginning to
[36:44] develop into our thinking
[36:47] as I was saying this morning about the
[36:50] the part of
[36:54] foreknowledge
[36:55] you know
[36:57] meaning that fact are thought of
[37:00] a knowledge before it transpires
[37:03] of what will transpire
[37:05] if if you know they wouldn't have been
[37:08] written about something that would take
[37:10] place in other words if Isaiah was
[37:12] saying a virgin shall conceive if that
[37:14] never had taken place
[37:16] look what it would have been
[37:18] right you wouldn't call it a false
[37:21] prophecy but you would call it a you
[37:23] know it wouldn't be a reality
[37:26] and see the Bible says that Jesus Christ
[37:28] stood as a lamb before the foundation of
[37:30] the world you know slain but now
[37:33] he wasn't physically slain
[37:37] and if that never happened
[37:40] then we're still in our sins
[37:42] but it did happen
[37:44] here on Earth
[37:46] all right so then we try to get
[37:47] everything to line up into that of
[37:49] thinking of foreknowledge because even
[37:52] though we're trying to go back in to the
[37:55] mind of God and think about these things
[37:58] you will see this as quick as we do
[38:00] already have some notes written before
[38:02] we jump right back
[38:05] to where we're at in life
[38:07] because right around and said it was
[38:09] God's
[38:10] plan and purpose
[38:14] to
[38:15] give his eternal life
[38:18] to you and I
[38:21] what about that that was his plan and
[38:23] purpose was to
[38:25] divide himself
[38:27] I remember brother Mo preaching on that
[38:29] years ago you know and you talk about
[38:32] him dividing himself and you think about
[38:34] taking an apple and you cut it up seeing
[38:37] the smallest you could ever cut it up
[38:39] you're giving it away you'd still run
[38:41] out of pieces
[38:42] well the way I look at the way God is
[38:45] and the way he's expanding himself that
[38:48] the more he expands himself the greater
[38:49] he gets
[38:51] instead of running out of pieces you
[38:53] know and and doing it and we're not
[38:55] going to run out of the word don't worry
[38:56] about that no we're going to try to keep
[38:58] right on going with it
[39:00] all right
[39:01] but talking about how does God
[39:04] predestinate
[39:07] he predestinates by his foreknowledge
[39:11] and that would mean that he would be
[39:13] infinite
[39:15] in doing those things and all that's
[39:18] down here in life and everything God
[39:20] knew would take place transpire Among Us
[39:23] and they will be as I said a moment ago
[39:25] a bride because God said it
[39:28] that will walk off the earth
[39:30] in rapture I'm intending to be part of
[39:33] the one that walks off I may not be if I
[39:35] don't worry about whether I'm alive you
[39:37] know that doesn't matter to me if I have
[39:40] to go by the grave that's no disgrace
[39:42] I'll just have to beat you up his sister
[39:44] Cleveland used to say you'd say if I die
[39:47] before before you know you do brother
[39:49] Dale I'll just get to beat you up I said
[39:52] well that's be a good thing she's kind
[39:53] of small she probably whipped me now but
[39:56] because you know but think about it now
[40:01] do you see what I'm trying to drive at I
[40:04] mean whether you believe it or not
[40:08] see there was a time that God dwelt
[40:10] Alone
[40:13] he was self-existing
[40:16] and when he dwelt alone he then
[40:21] he was
[40:24] we can't use the word God because it
[40:26] means an object to worship
[40:29] and we can't use the just the point of
[40:32] Elohim as to be himself existing
[40:37] but to just think about God and how
[40:40] Eternal he is
[40:43] and what he can do
[40:45] that's the whole thing I want you to see
[40:48] if anything else is to look back at God
[40:51] and see his condescending downward to
[40:54] where we can comprehend
[40:55] and if he had not sent us a prophet
[40:59] we would not have it I said this morning
[41:01] maybe that's a hard way of saying it but
[41:03] see we say well well I've got the Holy
[41:05] Ghost God can reveal it to him well why
[41:07] didn't he
[41:09] that's just as plain as it can be man
[41:11] sitting at my house one day and I knew
[41:13] their Doctrine and they said we go
[41:15] beyond brother Branham said you know
[41:18] said he preached us up to here
[41:20] and then we go beyond him I said well
[41:23] according to my understanding brother he
[41:25] preached us all the way to the Future
[41:27] home
[41:30] and I said if you can tell me anything I
[41:33] placed our go ahead
[41:35] you know
[41:37] well he just hushed him
[41:39] called me a smart alec but maybe I was
[41:42] you know but it's true
[41:45] you know
[41:46] because if he could tell me something
[41:47] home Beyond where the Prophet took us
[41:49] going out to eternities and bring down
[41:52] something you know but they didn't have
[41:55] that point in mind you know exactly
[41:58] but now think about it
[42:00] God dwelt Alone
[42:05] but he dwelt alone with his thoughts
[42:10] his attributes
[42:13] now he had attributes in him we went
[42:15] through that this morning
[42:17] you were an attribute in your father
[42:21] but you don't remember being there and
[42:23] there was no part of you there
[42:24] physically in the basis of a of a person
[42:29] the best you could do was maybe a a gene
[42:33] don't even bring it down to a germ
[42:35] because you can't do that when you're
[42:37] coming down from granddaddy you know
[42:39] great granddaddy
[42:41] Etc you only bring it to a germ when you
[42:43] get it to the basis of the connecting to
[42:45] make you so then you would just be in a
[42:48] gene in some connection some way back in
[42:51] your your DNA makeup that they can
[42:54] follow it right
[42:56] but not at something wiggle tails you
[43:00] know
[43:01] you know what I'm getting at the wiggle
[43:03] tails you know the little thing that
[43:04] connects to make the body
[43:06] all right see then you you can't do that
[43:08] it'd have to be wound back past that
[43:10] and and I never could comprehend what
[43:13] was doing it and I knew that but we all
[43:16] did but brother Branham said it one day
[43:19] he said the uh Gene or germ or whatever
[43:22] it would be that would make a a gnat
[43:26] was the same size as a gene or a germ
[43:28] that would make an elephant
[43:30] yeah if you can explain that to me then
[43:34] we'll uh we'll we'll talk a little but
[43:38] now think about it
[43:40] God dwelt Alone
[43:45] with his thoughts
[43:47] all right
[43:48] now then that could not mean that you
[43:51] and I
[43:52] in any form could be back there
[43:55] physically
[43:56] that ought to be enough common sense
[43:59] to think about it you don't need a
[44:01] revelation to realize that
[44:03] you know it's not a supernatural great
[44:05] Revelation boy look at me I was back
[44:07] there
[44:08] you know
[44:10] no
[44:14] what we are had to start somewhere
[44:18] and if it started somewhere it certainly
[44:21] didn't start in eternity
[44:24] I'm talking about me and you
[44:26] now
[44:27] something about us physically cannot be
[44:30] put back into eternity
[44:33] the best we can do is to say in the mind
[44:36] of God
[44:38] all right
[44:39] now but remember
[44:42] that every person that ever be in the
[44:44] world
[44:45] was in the mind of God also
[44:48] at the time he thought of you being here
[44:51] today
[44:52] he thought of the world and how it's
[44:54] going and where the people are at
[44:57] so then we don't lay on well I was in
[44:59] his mind
[45:03] no I want to be apart
[45:05] of God
[45:08] that the only one that's eternal
[45:12] and not to just be something he thought
[45:14] of
[45:17] because that's that's basically our
[45:20] mentality of our thinking
[45:23] is that the best we could do was some
[45:25] word down the line he thought of
[45:27] something
[45:29] well all right he did
[45:31] but just remember
[45:34] the eternal life you have
[45:38] is not a thought of God
[45:42] it's God himself
[45:45] or you've got multiple gods
[45:47] some way you know something figured out
[45:50] so they don't erase a lot of things I've
[45:52] noticed and brother random on a on some
[45:54] quotes looking at he said I'm not doing
[45:57] this to to uh create a doctor and he
[46:00] said I'm doing this to straighten it out
[46:01] you know so that's a good way
[46:04] I'm not trying to show some smart alec
[46:07] Doctrine and thought I'm trying to
[46:08] straighten out our doctrines
[46:10] because God's Doctrine didn't need to be
[46:12] straightened out
[46:13] the Bible said what it meant meant what
[46:15] it said we were the ones that had it
[46:18] confused
[46:19] and so is the prophet's message all
[46:21] right
[46:22] but now to think about it
[46:25] that if God
[46:31] is eternal
[46:33] infinite Etc
[46:36] then he's never had another thought
[46:40] now that that's that's hard for us to
[46:42] even
[46:43] fathom whatsoever
[46:46] that he never had another thought
[46:50] because he thought was perfect
[46:54] eternal
[46:56] all right we'll get to it maybe not
[46:58] today but brother Brown says in a church
[47:00] age book he said the thoughts of God are
[47:03] eternal
[47:04] he said that gives an eternal thought to
[47:07] the elect
[47:09] why
[47:11] because to realize that not that we were
[47:13] what he thought of
[47:16] but to be a part of him I tried to
[47:19] explain right after lights this morning
[47:22] the fact of
[47:24] the thoughts of God
[47:27] and how that our thoughts can be changed
[47:30] or whatever you know added to
[47:33] but his thoughts is a part of him
[47:37] now I believe in this way
[47:40] that God saw
[47:43] that Judas was going to do what he would
[47:46] do
[47:48] you'll go along with it
[47:51] well see then you say well there was no
[47:53] hopes for Judas no he had it offered
[47:59] but God knew he would never accept it
[48:04] he knew he would never accept it
[48:07] well then you're not blaming God
[48:11] are making him a chooser
[48:14] you're making him as to know what will
[48:16] be
[48:19] I believe in Eternal thoughts of God
[48:23] to be a part of that one who was doing
[48:25] the thinking is my desire
[48:28] that way I can rest in knowing that if I
[48:32] have eternal life
[48:35] I don't have to worry about anything
[48:39] he said well if they said to run around
[48:41] and said that would give me a ride to
[48:42] just go out and do anything he said I do
[48:43] what I want to
[48:48] see it's not some loose ended thing that
[48:51] you just sent this way no that's one
[48:53] thing that I'm hoping
[48:54] that about eight sermons on four
[48:57] knowledge or nine I guess it's a 10 or
[48:59] 11 well now
[49:01] that
[49:02] it would finally get down into you as to
[49:05] what I'm trying to drive out
[49:08] this is the most wonderful day that has
[49:11] ever been in the world
[49:13] I had rather be here
[49:16] than to be back there walking on the
[49:18] shores of Galilee with the Lord Jesus
[49:20] Christ
[49:23] you would think oh if I could just be
[49:24] back there
[49:25] see that's you're still trying out here
[49:27] with these old things
[49:29] no
[49:30] I'd rather be here today than any word
[49:32] that I know of In Time
[49:34] or any point
[49:36] because you know what what's going to
[49:38] happen somebody's going to catch it
[49:40] and somebody is going to walk off the
[49:42] earth
[49:43] that's never been done before
[49:46] he said well Enoch done it and Elijah
[49:48] wouldn't know but not this way
[49:53] they went because of God you're speaking
[49:55] it was gone we have something to do with
[50:00] this
[50:02] right we are living our predestination
[50:05] and we're proving what we are
[50:10] and see there's there's no need of
[50:13] worrying that's why I always live an
[50:14] open book my wife says a lot of times
[50:16] that you're just too open no I'm just an
[50:19] open book you know why because I don't
[50:20] want no close pages
[50:23] because if I got closed Pages I'll have
[50:25] to those out to be open one of these
[50:27] days without the answer for
[50:29] see I'd rather just be what I am
[50:33] and I enjoy being a Christian
[50:35] I enjoy thinking about God's word
[50:40] and just meditating on it
[50:43] still in the middle of the night it just
[50:45] something to wake up and
[50:47] to lay there and just think about
[50:51] that God has given you and I
[50:55] all of the word
[50:57] that will ever be given to mankind
[51:01] in this world
[51:03] I'd give my own not me but him
[51:08] you say well the Jews has got theirs but
[51:10] we already know what's going to happen
[51:11] did you listen to why I said it I said
[51:13] he's given unto us all the word that
[51:17] will ever be given on this side of
[51:19] Eternity
[51:22] and we can rejoice in believing it and
[51:24] accepting it
[51:26] in the little simple things that we
[51:28] wondered about
[51:30] you know down through our time in
[51:33] organized religions in time
[51:35] those things are becoming just so simple
[51:38] you remember how you used to think about
[51:39] whether hell was eternal or not and if
[51:42] you went there you might burn eternally
[51:43] because that's what she was taught
[51:48] this little simple thing how many gods
[51:51] are they
[51:52] well we believe it's just one but it's
[51:54] God in three persons Blessed Trinity
[51:56] nobody can understand it
[52:00] we just have to believe and just
[52:05] but to think of the day and the hour
[52:07] that we're living
[52:09] It's the Most Wonderful Time the world
[52:11] has ever seen
[52:13] I told you I love this point so we'll
[52:15] start from that one
[52:17] of the quote we gave this morning from
[52:20] who do you say this is go ahead brother
[52:21] Knight number nine
[52:24] because I love this quote
[52:27] who you say this is 64 12 27 paragraph
[52:31] 67. that's the way he was he was in the
[52:34] beginning by himself God dwelt Alone
[52:36] with his thoughts
[52:38] he'll never do that again
[52:42] he'll never dwell alone with his
[52:45] thoughts
[52:47] why because his thoughts
[52:51] are being made manifest
[52:55] and that's why we are
[52:58] right here
[53:01] right here okay
[53:03] Lula Georgia
[53:05] that's why we're right here
[53:07] this day
[53:09] is God fellowshipping with his thoughts
[53:12] being made manifest see there you are so
[53:16] you by taking thought cannot add one
[53:18] cubit to your stature
[53:19] you can't do no good number two you know
[53:23] but to God to fellowship with his
[53:25] thoughts
[53:27] see his thoughts are being made manifest
[53:29] his attributes
[53:31] are being made manifest
[53:34] and he has the ability
[53:36] to not stay up in heaven
[53:39] but to come down here
[53:41] and fellowship
[53:43] with you and I
[53:45] I thought the prophet said the purpose
[53:46] of God creating man was for
[53:50] Fellowship
[53:53] what part of the fellowship do you think
[53:55] he's going to get the most enjoyment of
[53:59] and don't misunderstand me he enjoys it
[54:01] all
[54:03] he's even not over here pointing to
[54:05] nothing but he's in these churches
[54:07] and they're seeing an endorsement about
[54:09] him
[54:11] and you know he's there because he loves
[54:13] worship
[54:14] no man
[54:19] well look around
[54:21] you might have a problem with a guy
[54:22] sitting next to you
[54:26] a few of you looked around anyway
[54:31] thank you
[54:34] Fellowship
[54:36] brother Bonds were said Two Fellas and
[54:38] one ship
[54:39] that's what I told her brother one time
[54:41] I said I'm tickled to death to ride in
[54:43] your boat
[54:45] anytime you want to ride in it we'll
[54:48] just sit down and talk about what you
[54:50] believe
[54:51] but I said there's only one stipulation
[54:55] I want you to ride in my boat for just a
[54:58] little while
[55:00] I said because I want to talk to you
[55:01] about what I see
[55:02] right all right now let's get on to the
[55:05] thought
[55:06] so we dwelled alone with his attributes
[55:09] that's his thoughts
[55:14] that's his thoughts
[55:16] see we want to put something back
[55:19] younger
[55:21] and put our connections back there
[55:25] and say well if if I could just find out
[55:28] I was back there
[55:30] no as I said I'd rather know him right
[55:33] here
[55:35] because see I know I've experienced
[55:38] salvation
[55:42] so I know I've experienced it
[55:44] I'm not putting it on something
[55:47] somebody might trick my thoughts of a
[55:50] long time ago
[55:52] I am experiencing
[55:56] what I believe
[55:57] and having a good time in doing that all
[56:00] right
[56:00] now here's what we're going to be on
[56:03] this evening so I've had this for us to
[56:05] do on Wednesday but so we're still on
[56:07] the same notes if you got them you can
[56:09] just
[56:12] but I want us to think about
[56:15] back before
[56:16] time or anything
[56:19] back where we was talking about
[56:21] in the mind of God
[56:24] and thinking about
[56:27] God dwelling alone
[56:30] and if there's no part of us humanly
[56:32] speaking
[56:34] could exist in eternity
[56:37] whether Body Spirit our soul
[56:41] see that's why I fight those doctrines
[56:43] you don't realize it
[56:46] see the two Soul people they talked
[56:49] and if you could be saved you had two
[56:51] Souls with the person that couldn't be
[56:52] saved just had one
[56:54] because he got it from the Devil
[56:56] all right
[56:58] but the other one it could be saved he
[57:00] had two Souls Satan give him one the
[57:03] devil give him one
[57:05] well I told him I said I can't go along
[57:07] with that because Satan's not a creator
[57:12] you know
[57:13] so then he can't give your soul he
[57:16] perverts the nature of your soul
[57:18] I talked with a man that started the
[57:20] doctrine
[57:21] I said I can't see it
[57:24] because
[57:26] their point was
[57:29] well
[57:31] all you needed to do was kill that old
[57:33] soul that come from the Devil
[57:38] because that other Soul come from God
[57:40] and always was eternal
[57:44] now check your Doctrine and see if I'm
[57:46] right
[57:48] that was why it was called two Souls
[57:54] one coming from God one coming from the
[57:56] devil kill the one that come from devil
[57:58] when it comes from God didn't need
[58:00] nothing
[58:01] within you don't need Jesus Christ
[58:06] that's what I tried my best to tell some
[58:08] of them I know I'm very good hateful and
[58:12] old goat says things hard
[58:16] but I said
[58:17] I said there's no more than one I told a
[58:19] man it was a Church of Christ one time
[58:23] you know they they believe in water
[58:25] baptism under regeneration
[58:27] I said if that's true now
[58:29] uh the biggest fish place I can find
[58:32] where there's a lot of people is I'll
[58:34] just meet you in Gainesville and we'll
[58:36] go out on Lake Lanier we're the swimming
[58:38] pools the Lakes out you know
[58:41] and I said we'll just walk down the line
[58:43] and we'll just push them in in the name
[58:45] of the Lord Jesus of course he didn't
[58:46] like the Lord Jesus Christ but that's
[58:48] another point but uh you know I said
[58:51] we'll just push them in
[58:54] well that wasn't being sarcastic
[58:57] I was telling the truth
[58:59] and I told a man about the two Soul
[59:01] doctors talking to me I said that be so
[59:03] all you need to do is kill the one that
[59:05] comes from the Devil
[59:07] Boeing
[59:09] he's gone
[59:12] y'all might have to go to heaven
[59:14] right
[59:15] because if you sold the Eternal where's
[59:17] your soul going so you just killed the
[59:19] one
[59:20] they come from the devil do that with a
[59:22] 22 right between the eyes and you got it
[59:24] made you automatically in heaven
[59:27] well you're just too sarcastic
[59:31] did the point get across
[59:35] I don't care about the rest of it did
[59:36] the point get across
[59:40] folks we need a new birth
[59:43] we must have a new birth
[59:46] there's no choice about it
[59:49] because we only have eternal life by
[59:52] receiving it
[59:55] and only by that by him coming to Earth
[59:58] could he share that eternal life
[1:00:01] with you and I
[1:00:03] all right
[1:00:05] what were we back before the foundation
[1:00:07] world
[1:00:09] you know back on in God's mind the back
[1:00:11] part of God's mind back when he was
[1:00:13] dwelling alone
[1:00:17] we would have to be a part of that God
[1:00:21] to be there
[1:00:24] now will you go along with that
[1:00:27] we couldn't be there's people in
[1:00:28] identities because the first thing it
[1:00:30] was created was angels
[1:00:33] people didn't come first
[1:00:35] don't worry about it I got the notes
[1:00:37] already for the morning Stars saying
[1:00:40] together the sons of God shouted for Joy
[1:00:42] they're laying on the desk waiting about
[1:00:43] three services
[1:00:47] but think about it
[1:00:50] to be a part of God
[1:00:54] not just something he thought of
[1:00:57] that's not my goal sister Gail
[1:01:00] to just be something he thought of
[1:01:02] and the best he could think of me
[1:01:06] now we will get to it like this
[1:01:08] you know that foolish virgins are only
[1:01:11] what he thought of
[1:01:15] but one day they'll get eternal life
[1:01:18] but that eternal life they receive will
[1:01:21] not make them the bride of Christ
[1:01:25] so they were only a part in the basis of
[1:01:28] what he thought of
[1:01:32] we're not just what he thought of
[1:01:34] we've got to be him made manifest
[1:01:37] and be careful brother Dale you're going
[1:01:40] to make us deity
[1:01:42] how much do you want for the quotes
[1:01:45] okay did the prophet say
[1:01:49] it is deity speaking
[1:01:53] did the prophet call us little Messiahs
[1:02:00] see I'm talking about being a part of
[1:02:02] that God
[1:02:04] that would think of all the other things
[1:02:09] and at that same time he would think
[1:02:11] about
[1:02:12] what I would be
[1:02:14] if he put me in flesh
[1:02:19] he knowed that I'd want to be saved
[1:02:24] not because he would give me eternal
[1:02:26] life coming upon the Earth
[1:02:29] with my foreknowledge he would know I'd
[1:02:31] want to be saved
[1:02:34] then he could predetermine it
[1:02:38] but there's no foreknowledge connected
[1:02:41] to the part of God that I'm speaking of
[1:02:45] I'm speaking of the one that done the
[1:02:47] thinking
[1:02:49] I'm speaking of the god that had the
[1:02:51] foreknowledge
[1:02:55] I'm speaking of Sons and Daughters of a
[1:02:57] living God
[1:03:03] sons and daughters
[1:03:07] are
[1:03:08] God's offspring
[1:03:14] you follow me
[1:03:16] not something thinks of
[1:03:20] but for him
[1:03:23] why can't we Rejoice about thinking of
[1:03:25] those things well brother random what
[1:03:27] were we back there all right let's pick
[1:03:29] up on number 11.
[1:03:36] well let me let's get number 10 first
[1:03:38] brother Joe
[1:03:39] I don't want to lose this one
[1:03:42] come back okay
[1:03:45] who is this Melchizedek
[1:03:48] recent 65
[1:03:50] paragraph 46 47 now in the beginning God
[1:03:54] dwelt Alone with his attributes as I
[1:03:56] spoke of this morning that's his
[1:03:58] thoughts there was nothing just got
[1:04:00] alone but he had thoughts
[1:04:04] just like a great architect and sat down
[1:04:06] in his mind and draw out what he thinks
[1:04:07] it's going to be to build
[1:04:10] he's going to build
[1:04:12] create now he cannot create
[1:04:15] he can take something that's been
[1:04:17] created make it into something different
[1:04:19] all right but he gets in his mind
[1:04:22] what he's going to do and that's his
[1:04:24] thoughts that's his desires that's the
[1:04:27] thought and then he speaks it and it's a
[1:04:30] word then a word a thought when it's
[1:04:32] expressed as a word
[1:04:34] a thought expressed is a word but it has
[1:04:37] to be a thought first
[1:04:39] so if God's attributes excuse me so it's
[1:04:43] God's attributes then it becomes a
[1:04:46] thought
[1:04:47] than a word
[1:04:53] now
[1:04:54] in the seal book I'll be glad to find
[1:04:56] you the pages right around is referring
[1:04:58] to Moses
[1:04:59] that said God gave the thought to Moses
[1:05:03] he said first it's God's thoughts and
[1:05:05] then it's Moses thought he said it's not
[1:05:06] a word yet
[1:05:08] he said then he steps out and speaks and
[1:05:10] says Let There Be flies
[1:05:12] he said it become a word so there is a
[1:05:15] way to come for it to be the word see so
[1:05:17] that's why he's talking about this it's
[1:05:19] God's attributes then it becomes a
[1:05:21] thought then a word notice those who
[1:05:23] have who have tonight eternal life was
[1:05:27] with him and in him in his thinking
[1:05:30] before there ever was an angel star
[1:05:33] cherubim or anything else that's Eternal
[1:05:36] and if you have eternal life
[1:05:38] you always was not your being here
[1:05:44] but the shape and form of the infinite
[1:05:47] God
[1:05:49] now how much plainer could that be
[1:05:53] he's covered the thoughts attributes
[1:05:56] down to thoughts and even down to word
[1:05:58] and then turns right around and says not
[1:06:00] your being
[1:06:01] now you know what he's talking about
[1:06:05] not our being not us
[1:06:08] not Body Spirit and soul human beings
[1:06:14] because that wasn't back there
[1:06:21] see not your being here
[1:06:23] he goes on to talking about that God is
[1:06:26] Not Like the Wind on down below God is a
[1:06:29] being I love that
[1:06:31] he's a being he's not like the wind
[1:06:35] rather random where we
[1:06:38] what were we before the world
[1:06:40] were we Spirits now go to number 11.
[1:06:44] in the first parts of number 11 was
[1:06:46] on paragraph 165
[1:06:50] if we were saved before the fact oh we
[1:06:52] don't want to stop here if we were
[1:06:54] saying before the foundation where were
[1:06:55] we yes
[1:06:57] yes sir Revelation 13 8 said that we
[1:07:00] were saved and your name was put in the
[1:07:02] Lamb's Book of Life before the world was
[1:07:04] ever created
[1:07:06] then he goes through Ephesians
[1:07:09] and giving you the scriptures and the
[1:07:11] things how did he come to Die For Us
[1:07:13] roll it on up now and we'll go to the
[1:07:16] the quote that comes after it
[1:07:18] your name was written in the book for
[1:07:20] the foundation of the world
[1:07:22] he goes on to the next paragraph
[1:07:24] said were we Spirits then no we were not
[1:07:28] even nothing
[1:07:30] but in God's mind we were
[1:07:32] and he spoke it and it materialized
[1:07:35] so we wasn't spirits
[1:07:38] we were to have enough one-eyed in high
[1:07:40] sense he Brother Don rodel used to say a
[1:07:42] good point anyone one-eyed in high sense
[1:07:45] knows our bodies went back there
[1:07:49] and we're named Spirits were in the mind
[1:07:52] of God
[1:07:55] in God's thinking
[1:07:57] then he would speak it it would become
[1:07:59] material so we're going to be dealing
[1:08:01] this afternoon with the fact that
[1:08:04] there's not any part of us
[1:08:08] physically speaking of any form Body
[1:08:10] Spirit and soul that would be back there
[1:08:12] you said well what about your soul
[1:08:16] not our souls
[1:08:18] we'll get to that in a minute only the
[1:08:20] soul that comes from God God's Own God's
[1:08:22] soul is the only one that has eternal
[1:08:24] life
[1:08:27] Even Adam
[1:08:29] being created
[1:08:32] come on
[1:08:33] Blasphemous names God had to breathe
[1:08:36] into Adam
[1:08:38] eternal life
[1:08:43] the rest don't come that way becoming
[1:08:44] sin right
[1:08:45] all right let's run on Fires now and
[1:08:47] pick up what we're doing
[1:08:49] look at the next one number 12 sirs we
[1:08:51] would see Jesus
[1:08:53] 1964.
[1:08:57] I hate to read all of it but I don't
[1:08:59] want to lose it either
[1:09:01] God is life eternal life in the
[1:09:03] beginning was God it wasn't God at that
[1:09:05] time because God the English word god
[1:09:07] means object of worship and there wasn't
[1:09:09] nothing but him he was
[1:09:12] eternal just the Eternal one and there
[1:09:14] was no moon no stars No Angels no
[1:09:16] nothing but in this being that we call
[1:09:19] God our Father whose attributes and him
[1:09:22] was attribute to be father and him was
[1:09:24] attributed to be God and him was
[1:09:26] attribute to be son and him was
[1:09:28] attribute to be Savior and him was
[1:09:30] attribute to be healer and all these
[1:09:32] things that we see now is just
[1:09:34] displaying his attributes
[1:09:37] yeah now if we if you were in his
[1:09:41] thinking at the beginning
[1:09:43] and look at all the IFS
[1:09:48] if you got eternal life
[1:09:50] there is only form of eternal life
[1:09:53] eternal life has no beginning it has no
[1:09:55] ending so if you have eternal life
[1:10:00] you were an attribute of God's thinking
[1:10:02] before there was anything but him
[1:10:07] your form your shape and what you are
[1:10:09] now is just a negative
[1:10:14] okay
[1:10:15] when you come into the world he explains
[1:10:17] what
[1:10:18] you know about 20 God takes a picture
[1:10:22] life develops it out
[1:10:24] all right so then what were we
[1:10:32] not any form of this this is just a
[1:10:34] negative
[1:10:38] this this part that we live in is a
[1:10:40] negative
[1:10:41] not a positive point
[1:10:45] okay
[1:10:46] all right look what he says things that
[1:10:47] are to be
[1:10:50] number 13.
[1:10:55] we've got two of them out here today
[1:10:57] that they don't have to be back there in
[1:10:58] the back because
[1:10:59] whenever doing pretty good so we had
[1:11:02] these notes along all they got to do is
[1:11:04] just keep running them
[1:11:06] now the only way that you can be a son
[1:11:09] or a daughter of God
[1:11:12] what
[1:11:13] because you have to be the have to have
[1:11:16] eternal life and there's only one form
[1:11:18] of eternal life and that's God's life
[1:11:20] only one form of eternal life that was
[1:11:22] God
[1:11:23] there to be a Son of God you had to be
[1:11:26] in him always
[1:11:30] well I heard it was in him always now
[1:11:32] what does he say
[1:11:34] the gene
[1:11:38] of your life
[1:11:40] spiritual life
[1:11:43] now you be real careful with brother
[1:11:45] random and watch it
[1:11:47] and you'll see him so accurate and
[1:11:49] amazing me of the accuracy the man holds
[1:11:53] because when he wants to use germ he
[1:11:55] knows how to say it
[1:11:58] when he wants to use Gene he knows how
[1:12:00] to say it you remember what we were
[1:12:01] saying this morning
[1:12:04] you and your daddy your granddaddy your
[1:12:07] great granddaddy he was only in gene
[1:12:12] when you come to Daddy
[1:12:13] in connection with Mama you talk about a
[1:12:16] germ
[1:12:19] right
[1:12:21] Gene don't give birth
[1:12:23] germs
[1:12:27] look you had to be in him always the
[1:12:30] gene of your life spiritual life tonight
[1:12:32] was in God the Father before there was
[1:12:34] even a molecule and see you are nothing
[1:12:36] but the manifestation of the gene of
[1:12:39] life that was in God as a son of God
[1:12:44] now you're expressed after his word has
[1:12:47] come in you
[1:12:48] right
[1:12:50] to light up this age you're expressing
[1:12:52] God's life in you because you're our son
[1:12:55] or a daughter of God therefore you get
[1:12:58] what I mean
[1:12:59] they say Amen
[1:13:00] you are now made you're you're sitting
[1:13:03] in this church
[1:13:04] tonight because your duty is to express
[1:13:07] God to this nation and to this people
[1:13:10] in this neighborhood where you you
[1:13:13] associate
[1:13:15] where you are or God knew that you would
[1:13:18] be here because you have to be one of
[1:13:20] his genes
[1:13:22] or his attributes
[1:13:24] you had to be if you you ever if you've
[1:13:27] got eternal life there's more questions
[1:13:29] right
[1:13:32] then it always was
[1:13:34] eternal life and God before there was a
[1:13:36] foundation World knew that you would be
[1:13:39] here and when the word or the water the
[1:13:41] washing and the water of the word fell
[1:13:43] upon you you it was expressed in a being
[1:13:47] right now you have fellowship with your
[1:13:49] father not just as you have with your
[1:13:52] Earthly father see you are citizens of
[1:13:55] the king not citizens but you are
[1:13:58] children
[1:14:00] Sons and Daughters of the Living God
[1:14:03] if it be that the eternal life dwells in
[1:14:05] you
[1:14:08] what about it
[1:14:11] are we the children of God
[1:14:16] then we're his offspring
[1:14:21] and the only way you can be an offspring
[1:14:22] of God
[1:14:24] is to be a child of God
[1:14:27] it says well we must be born again
[1:14:33] now if not then you're going to have to
[1:14:35] rewrite the whole Bible the message and
[1:14:37] everything even two thousand years of
[1:14:40] church history
[1:14:42] because every age has had the new birth
[1:14:46] and believe in God for that age
[1:14:49] if it's not you're going to have to
[1:14:50] rewrite and the disciples just come to a
[1:14:53] knowledge
[1:14:54] and Jesus just gave them a knowledge
[1:14:58] and he didn't have to die on Calvary
[1:15:02] he just gave him a knowledge
[1:15:04] and went on
[1:15:08] even in the
[1:15:10] uh you said well what we need is an
[1:15:11] opening for understanding
[1:15:13] even in Jesus after his resurrection
[1:15:19] he spoke to the disciples
[1:15:22] and they seen what he was talking about
[1:15:27] other times they would say now we
[1:15:28] believe
[1:15:31] it was just an opening of our
[1:15:32] understanding that we need
[1:15:34] or is it in a new birth
[1:15:37] where the person can come into us
[1:15:42] why did Jesus have to go to hell
[1:15:48] if all we need is a knock on the head
[1:15:49] and kill us to get rid of the Old Devil
[1:15:52] what does Jesus have to go to hell for
[1:15:56] I got it laying right here if you want
[1:15:57] me to read it we'll run around and said
[1:15:59] his Gene his person his soul
[1:16:02] his theophany of his being
[1:16:05] went to hell
[1:16:11] those disciples laying in the upper room
[1:16:12] waiting on eternal life
[1:16:17] had he not come back and given them
[1:16:18] eternal life where would we all be
[1:16:21] so it's not just a head knowledge
[1:16:24] of what we are
[1:16:26] it's an experience
[1:16:30] if nothing else this church ought to
[1:16:32] know brother Dale believes in the
[1:16:34] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[1:16:36] Ghost
[1:16:37] I believe in a definite experience of
[1:16:39] justification
[1:16:41] I believe in a definite experience of
[1:16:43] sanctification
[1:16:46] I certainly believe in the definite
[1:16:47] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[1:16:49] Ghost
[1:16:51] the person of Jesus Christ coming and
[1:16:53] living in you
[1:16:55] that's the only way we can have eternal
[1:16:57] life
[1:16:58] not killing off some old soul or some
[1:17:01] thought
[1:17:03] but an experience
[1:17:05] that takes place here that's why I'd
[1:17:07] rather be here
[1:17:08] than anywhere all right let's go on
[1:17:17] let's go on down to number 14.
[1:17:22] um
[1:17:27] works as Faith expressed
[1:17:31] Spirit can come out here and anoint you
[1:17:32] to do certain things
[1:17:34] and you do it but that don't mean you're
[1:17:36] saved
[1:17:39] see if it's just someone anointing or
[1:17:41] some Spirit there's some idea that we
[1:17:43] have or some anointing of a spirit that
[1:17:45] we shout glory to hallelujah we're saved
[1:17:48] you know crying for you know whatever
[1:17:49] that doesn't mean anything
[1:17:52] read it
[1:17:54] think of it conference prophesied you
[1:17:56] just cast out Devils see the spirit
[1:17:58] anointed him the rain falls under just
[1:18:01] the unjust the weeds can Rejoice with
[1:18:03] the wheat
[1:18:04] but it's what it is at the core okay
[1:18:08] there's where you can
[1:18:11] intellectuals can accept and say oh sure
[1:18:13] that looks good I believe that that
[1:18:16] still don't do it no sir and the spirit
[1:18:18] can actually make witness of it
[1:18:22] and still It Isn't So
[1:18:25] come on
[1:18:27] because that soul
[1:18:30] hasn't come from God
[1:18:35] there's only one soul
[1:18:37] one theophany
[1:18:39] on Eternal Soul
[1:18:42] the Bible says All Souls are mine known
[1:18:44] Ezekiel 18 4.
[1:18:47] because he created him
[1:18:50] but there's only one soul in Genesis 1
[1:18:52] 26 and 27.
[1:18:54] let us make man in our own image that's
[1:18:57] the theophany your Prophet said
[1:19:00] that's why I believe that praise Hebrew
[1:19:02] 80 of the Hebrew Book your soul is your
[1:19:04] theophany what
[1:19:05] a sinner has a theophany
[1:19:08] a body to go to when he dies
[1:19:11] I'm quoting brother Branham but a
[1:19:13] Christian has an upward current Cinder
[1:19:16] has a downward Christian has an upward
[1:19:19] and see when you receive eternal life
[1:19:24] it's not just some baptism of the spirit
[1:19:31] well
[1:19:32] I I thought right around talked about it
[1:19:34] he did
[1:19:36] because that's what it is
[1:19:39] but they fail to read these
[1:19:41] would run around them and it's laying
[1:19:42] here if you like it lord said God sent
[1:19:45] back his soul on the day of Pentecost in
[1:19:49] the form of the baptism of the Holy
[1:19:51] Ghost entombment 1953.
[1:19:57] what is the new birth
[1:20:02] well it's just a knowledge
[1:20:06] good Baptist that we believe
[1:20:10] but it's not some anointing on your
[1:20:12] spirit
[1:20:15] what did he say because if that soul
[1:20:19] hasn't come from God
[1:20:22] All Souls come from God
[1:20:25] now what's he just what's he talking
[1:20:27] about
[1:20:29] there's only one soul that comes from
[1:20:31] God eternal
[1:20:33] that's Jesus Christ
[1:20:36] every other Soul has to have eternal
[1:20:38] life
[1:20:39] Even Adam
[1:20:41] he breathed into his nostrils and he
[1:20:43] became a living Soul Blasphemous names
[1:20:46] the prophet said he breathed eternal
[1:20:48] life into Adam
[1:20:50] but see when we're born as babies we
[1:20:52] don't get eternal life
[1:20:55] we only get life permitted
[1:21:00] we're not eternal life
[1:21:02] or else Jesus Christ would not have it
[1:21:04] had to come see
[1:21:08] but if that Soul hasn't come from God it
[1:21:11] can make all the impersonations out here
[1:21:14] but it cannot be real you can act
[1:21:17] healing you can act like you have
[1:21:20] you can act like you receive it
[1:21:22] Christians can act like they're
[1:21:25] Christians and act and be ever so good
[1:21:27] at it but that don't mean that they're
[1:21:29] saved
[1:21:31] that's exactly right see the spirit can
[1:21:34] be there the real genuine Spirit the
[1:21:38] Holy Spirit can anoint you
[1:21:41] and that still don't mean you're saved
[1:21:44] it's that inside soul
[1:21:48] That Never Dies
[1:21:52] right
[1:21:53] it's got eternal life
[1:21:56] it always was eternal life see it come
[1:21:59] from God it goes to God it's the soul
[1:22:04] see why we need to know doctrines and
[1:22:07] ideas
[1:22:08] you ask a lot of ministers
[1:22:10] about the soul and they know nothing
[1:22:11] about it they've oh yeah the soul
[1:22:13] towards yeah
[1:22:16] but I'm not interested in
[1:22:19] satisfying you
[1:22:22] to get you to come to church or to be
[1:22:24] here or whatever to do
[1:22:26] I'm trying to preach to your soul
[1:22:30] I'm not trying to preach to your body
[1:22:35] I'm not trying to preach to your spirit
[1:22:38] I'm trying to preach to that inward part
[1:22:40] of you
[1:22:46] see when God according to souls that are
[1:22:49] in prison
[1:22:51] he said if he can get that soul to stand
[1:22:54] still long enough
[1:22:56] he said it'll die
[1:23:01] I think this gets you to listen
[1:23:04] until it worked and be planted
[1:23:08] then the Holy Ghost can come on the word
[1:23:12] why didn't no Holy Ghost come home
[1:23:16] a whole group of people on the day of
[1:23:18] Pentecost
[1:23:20] it came on 120 in the upper room but
[1:23:23] those were the ones that had heard the
[1:23:24] word
[1:23:25] you show me anywhere in the Bible
[1:23:29] that the holy ghost ever came on anybody
[1:23:31] that the word wouldn't plant it first
[1:23:34] that's all I desire
[1:23:37] show me any Scripture
[1:23:39] anybody that got the new birth without
[1:23:41] the word being planted
[1:23:43] all right
[1:23:45] well did that make us anything different
[1:23:48] are we some kind of super duper thing in
[1:23:50] the end time
[1:23:53] to see if that Soul hasn't come from God
[1:23:57] and the only one I'm concerned about
[1:23:59] being coming from God is his own soul
[1:24:03] and he sent back that Soul on the day of
[1:24:05] Pentecost
[1:24:06] in the form of the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:08] Spirit
[1:24:09] one because the spirit could anoint the
[1:24:12] spirit
[1:24:13] that's why you can have anointed ones
[1:24:18] and we just read the prophet said you
[1:24:19] can make it look like it's real
[1:24:23] now I can't look at you and determine
[1:24:25] the only thing I can determine is one
[1:24:27] thing
[1:24:29] and the only thing you can determine is
[1:24:31] one thing brother random what is the
[1:24:33] evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:35] Ghost
[1:24:36] he says it's whether or not the spirit
[1:24:38] in you agrees with the word
[1:24:45] you Shout Scream holler do all you want
[1:24:47] to
[1:24:49] still be lost
[1:24:53] but if you ever receive eternal life
[1:24:56] you can never be lost
[1:24:58] if you like 120 it was scared to death
[1:25:02] right
[1:25:04] you know one of them remember brother
[1:25:06] Ryan said one of them said why don't we
[1:25:07] just take it by faith
[1:25:11] you know taking it by faith didn't take
[1:25:13] away fear
[1:25:15] and if I'd have been there I believe I'd
[1:25:18] have said to you I'm still scared
[1:25:22] but when that Holy Ghost came they went
[1:25:24] right out of that room
[1:25:26] it wasn't scared of nothing
[1:25:30] well because they had something
[1:25:33] not just an anointing not just a fleshly
[1:25:35] thing
[1:25:38] they had a person living inside of them
[1:25:40] Paul said it's not I that liveth
[1:25:43] the Christ that liveth in me
[1:25:48] what he says
[1:25:54] go ahead to the next one
[1:25:58] 15. this is who is this Melchizedek
[1:26:02] paragraph 52 53 and we find him at the
[1:26:07] beginning his attributes and now you
[1:26:09] were
[1:26:10] with him then then is when the Book of
[1:26:13] Life comes into view and he goes through
[1:26:14] the scriptures you know for the founding
[1:26:16] think of it before Jesus was ever born 4
[1:26:20] 000 years before he came on Earth and
[1:26:23] several thousand years before you come
[1:26:24] on Earth Jesus in God's mind died for
[1:26:27] the sins of the world and the Book of
[1:26:29] Life was made and your name was put on
[1:26:31] that book of life before the foundation
[1:26:33] world that's the Bible true so your name
[1:26:36] was ordained of God and placed on the
[1:26:37] book of life before the foundation of
[1:26:39] the world
[1:26:40] now you were dire in his attributes
[1:26:44] I want you
[1:26:47] you don't remember it no
[1:26:49] because
[1:26:51] you're just a part of his life
[1:26:55] that's why you don't remember
[1:26:58] you're part of his life
[1:27:00] you're part of God when you become a son
[1:27:02] and daughter of God
[1:27:04] right
[1:27:05] don't remember the point we're trying to
[1:27:06] get to
[1:27:08] go on to the next
[1:27:14] 16.
[1:27:16] hmm
[1:27:18] ernan Church AIDS pretty good little bit
[1:27:20] of reading but bear with me
[1:27:22] page 149.
[1:27:24] watch carefully down see this before
[1:27:26] there was ever respect of Stardust
[1:27:29] before God was God God is an object of
[1:27:31] adoration and no one was Dire to worship
[1:27:34] him so he was at that time only
[1:27:36] potentially God
[1:27:38] and he was known only as eternal spirit
[1:27:40] listen the bride was already
[1:27:46] in his mind
[1:27:49] he didn't say on his mind
[1:27:57] the one I like is I gave you one dish
[1:27:58] the other week where where brought
[1:28:00] around and says the bride will never be
[1:28:02] in his mouth
[1:28:05] you remember that one
[1:28:06] a few weeks ago
[1:28:08] did the bride will never be in his mouth
[1:28:09] why because he can spew you out
[1:28:14] right he could feel you out if you're
[1:28:16] just in his in his mouth because he's
[1:28:18] going to spew everything else out
[1:28:20] but when you're in his mind he can't get
[1:28:21] rid of you
[1:28:22] he said I mean you're engraved upon the
[1:28:26] Palms with my hand
[1:28:28] that scripture
[1:28:33] Wright was already in his mind yes she
[1:28:35] was she was existing in his thoughts and
[1:28:38] what about those thoughts of God they
[1:28:40] are Eternal are they not the Eternal
[1:28:42] thoughts of God let me ask you are the
[1:28:44] thoughts of God Eternal if you can see
[1:28:46] this you will see many things God is
[1:28:48] unchangeable in both Essence and
[1:28:50] behavior we have studied that and proven
[1:28:52] that already God is infinite in his
[1:28:54] ability so therefore he as God must be
[1:28:57] in omniscient if he is omniscient then
[1:29:00] he is not now learning nor is he taking
[1:29:02] counsel even with himself nor is he at
[1:29:05] any time adding to his knowledge if he
[1:29:08] can add to his knowledge then he is not
[1:29:10] omniscient the best we could say is that
[1:29:13] sometime he will be but that is not
[1:29:15] scriptural
[1:29:16] he is omniscient he has never had a new
[1:29:19] thought about anything because all his
[1:29:21] thoughts
[1:29:22] and he has always had and always will
[1:29:25] have and knows the end from the
[1:29:27] beginning because he's God thus the
[1:29:29] thoughts of God are Eternal they are
[1:29:30] real now they are not simply like a man
[1:29:33] with a blueprint he's drawn up in which
[1:29:36] one day will become you remember
[1:29:39] a while ago we was reading it was like a
[1:29:41] man with a thought
[1:29:47] you remember that one remember the quote
[1:29:49] like a man with his dogs
[1:29:51] that he could think about what to make
[1:29:53] now he's saying it God's not that away
[1:29:54] is he contrary no he's explaining it
[1:29:59] see God
[1:30:01] in this point here
[1:30:03] is not like a man
[1:30:05] when you come to the Eternal thoughts of
[1:30:07] God in eternal life he's not like a man
[1:30:10] that's trying to think out what he's
[1:30:11] going to do
[1:30:14] his thoughts are eternal
[1:30:16] but then when man started to develop or
[1:30:19] we started he started condescending he
[1:30:22] started talking about what he would do
[1:30:24] he's not wrong he's right in both places
[1:30:27] he just needs a little getting together
[1:30:30] see here he's talking about it there's
[1:30:31] no way to change it and you see say that
[1:30:34] he has chosen Us in him Jesus for the
[1:30:36] foundation of the world that means that
[1:30:38] we were right there with him in the mind
[1:30:43] launch him
[1:30:45] and thoughts of God before the
[1:30:47] foundation of the world that gives an
[1:30:49] eternal quality to the elect you can't
[1:30:51] get away from it
[1:30:53] he said well then
[1:30:54] are you trying to say that
[1:30:56] we
[1:30:59] are his
[1:31:01] you know just in his mind
[1:31:04] no
[1:31:06] because we were in his mind he couldn't
[1:31:09] make it wouldn't be Jews I mean he'd be
[1:31:11] choosing if he picked out a bride
[1:31:16] are you listening
[1:31:18] if you were just in his mind just
[1:31:20] thinking of something he'd be choosing
[1:31:21] us
[1:31:22] but if we're a part of his mind
[1:31:25] if we're a part of his thoughts
[1:31:28] and that is only the eternal life that
[1:31:31] you have by the new birth
[1:31:33] do you understand that get that dwell in
[1:31:35] you that's what I believe anyway
[1:31:38] I believe you must receive eternal life
[1:31:41] if you're born with it
[1:31:45] then Jesus didn't have to die we'll get
[1:31:46] to the next message and he's thinking
[1:31:48] I've got another one
[1:31:52] but do you see what I'm talking about
[1:31:55] the bride of Christ
[1:31:57] it's not just in his mind
[1:32:00] they're very part of him
[1:32:03] there is very thoughts
[1:32:09] listen
[1:32:12] you know that he could have been God
[1:32:16] and let me put it let me straighten it
[1:32:18] out he was God
[1:32:21] not creating the angels
[1:32:25] right they made him God they worshiped
[1:32:27] him
[1:32:29] you know he could be
[1:32:32] you're going to frown on me so listen
[1:32:35] he could be father
[1:32:37] without a fall
[1:32:45] the fall bring savior healer
[1:32:48] two different words
[1:32:52] he could be a father without a fall
[1:32:58] that's only talking about the eternal
[1:33:00] life that's not talking about you and I
[1:33:02] as people
[1:33:04] they would have still had to brought us
[1:33:06] into being some way
[1:33:08] and he had Adam and Eve in the garden in
[1:33:10] the correct beautiful position
[1:33:13] you say how would we come they don't
[1:33:16] need to talk about it because we didn't
[1:33:18] but the truth is we could have come
[1:33:21] had there been no fall
[1:33:25] but he also had other attributes of
[1:33:27] Savior and healer so he couldn't have
[1:33:29] done that
[1:33:31] so he had to bring it some way
[1:33:34] that he could not only be God
[1:33:37] he could not only be father
[1:33:40] and have offspring
[1:33:44] but he could be Savior and healer
[1:33:46] so that would have to develop into the
[1:33:48] full knowledge
[1:33:49] and coming forth
[1:33:53] see but us being a part of God's
[1:33:54] thoughts
[1:33:56] not just something he thought of
[1:34:00] it was just something thought of you're
[1:34:02] dealing foreknowledge
[1:34:05] but to go back past four knowledge all
[1:34:07] the way into the mind to the Eternal God
[1:34:11] he dwelt alone
[1:34:13] now this is the way I love it he dwelt
[1:34:16] alone with his attributes
[1:34:18] his thoughts he said
[1:34:23] all right
[1:34:25] there was a time he was self-existing
[1:34:29] he dwelt alone with his thoughts his
[1:34:31] attributes
[1:34:33] had he not brought us into being
[1:34:37] as people
[1:34:39] he would have stayed self-existing
[1:34:44] if you could bring it into some way
[1:34:45] without a
[1:34:47] fall
[1:34:48] you're leaving him too much back is
[1:34:50] self-existing
[1:34:54] you realize Church in the worst shape
[1:34:56] that you and I could be in
[1:35:00] he still loves his people
[1:35:04] he loves his children
[1:35:10] Prophet said who would God hear quicker
[1:35:12] an angel
[1:35:14] or a child of his
[1:35:16] who would you hear quicker a neighbor or
[1:35:18] your children
[1:35:23] come on
[1:35:25] so the thoughts of God are eternal
[1:35:28] they are real they're not simply like a
[1:35:31] man with a blueprint
[1:35:34] for knowledge
[1:35:35] a man with a blueprint is for knowledge
[1:35:37] that's the point we got to this morning
[1:35:40] with the other quote where brother
[1:35:41] Brandon said it's just like a man
[1:35:43] thinking about something he can't create
[1:35:45] but he can take what's made he said God
[1:35:48] could create
[1:35:51] when he moved away
[1:35:54] now here's the whole point
[1:36:01] I chose to to start with the quote
[1:36:05] that he said he would never
[1:36:07] be self-existing again
[1:36:12] right
[1:36:14] I expressed all the thoughts of what we
[1:36:17] could about Jehovah meaning father with
[1:36:20] a family
[1:36:22] see he put us into this world and we
[1:36:24] could have called him father
[1:36:26] but that would have never been all he
[1:36:28] wanted
[1:36:33] he wanted you and I to love him
[1:36:38] why does your children love you
[1:36:51] Terence Lisa has to hide
[1:36:54] before they could sneak away from baby
[1:36:56] Ace
[1:37:00] right
[1:37:03] now to slip away and hide because we
[1:37:06] don't he's going to squall his eyeballs
[1:37:08] out
[1:37:09] you know why
[1:37:13] I'm sure I'm just saying it okay
[1:37:16] playing just talking
[1:37:18] I'm sure that he loves his
[1:37:21] up on Nanny on the other side I'm sure
[1:37:23] of that
[1:37:25] but what's the difference
[1:37:28] not it
[1:37:30] David and him don't have anything to do
[1:37:31] with him yes they do and play with but
[1:37:33] not like Terence does
[1:37:35] a lot of these little kids love Terence
[1:37:41] because he's always playing with him
[1:37:44] talking to him he gets them as quick as
[1:37:46] he can when they're born sits back there
[1:37:49] and half the time he's got they've got
[1:37:51] one or two on the line with them half
[1:37:53] the time holding them
[1:37:55] why
[1:38:00] because that child knows they love him
[1:38:04] because of the way they display it
[1:38:09] you thank God don't pet and pamper us
[1:38:14] oh you say I'm so sick I'm feeling so
[1:38:17] bad my daddy must be mad at me
[1:38:19] we'll go ask him
[1:38:24] right
[1:38:25] ask him if he is is he mad at you
[1:38:32] would you just think about what he's
[1:38:33] done for us
[1:38:37] think about how he saved us
[1:38:40] he's given us of his own life
[1:38:43] he's made us what he wants us to be his
[1:38:45] children
[1:38:47] and yet every one of us are different
[1:38:51] right
[1:38:52] so it's not just one set of line that he
[1:38:54] wants to
[1:38:55] to do and have of children
[1:39:00] he deals with every child in the way of
[1:39:02] that child
[1:39:08] and he loves to be worshiped
[1:39:12] what about the worships
[1:39:14] one praise a long time
[1:39:17] one shouts one's emotional
[1:39:22] another one is just
[1:39:24] quiet
[1:39:26] I'm not a prior Warrior never been one
[1:39:28] never claimed to be one
[1:39:29] I believe God's answered a few prayers I
[1:39:31] prayed but
[1:39:33] I've never been a prior Warrior there
[1:39:35] are prior Warriors that people just pray
[1:39:36] and pray and I thank God for that
[1:39:38] because who was it one of the Great Men
[1:39:41] down through time when he would go in to
[1:39:42] have a Revival he would get people and
[1:39:45] just put them under the bridges
[1:39:47] prayer warriors he put them under the
[1:39:49] bridges
[1:39:50] for the people to cross over to come
[1:39:52] into the city
[1:39:54] and revivals swept forth
[1:39:59] that's their ways but some are like me
[1:40:02] just
[1:40:03] you don't have to pet and pamper me
[1:40:08] I love it I'm a human being
[1:40:11] but you know how to do that
[1:40:13] I love you whether you love me or not
[1:40:17] whether you'll ever love me or not I
[1:40:19] love you
[1:40:20] and I don't love my kids just because
[1:40:22] they're my offspring
[1:40:24] I have a personal relationship with each
[1:40:27] one of them in a personal way
[1:40:29] the grandkids
[1:40:31] the great grandkids
[1:40:36] I have a relationship with each one of
[1:40:38] them
[1:40:41] they know they can come to Papa anytime
[1:40:45] and probably help them
[1:40:47] well because
[1:40:49] I want to be that to them
[1:40:51] if we could be that to one another how
[1:40:53] about God
[1:40:55] who loves us
[1:40:57] he gave sister Gail you the new birth
[1:40:59] for some reason
[1:41:03] he said well no I was just so good
[1:41:06] foreign
[1:41:09] he gave it for some reason
[1:41:12] he made you his child for some reason
[1:41:20] what is that reason or what is that
[1:41:22] thought that we need to bring
[1:41:26] I believe
[1:41:29] that the children of God who have
[1:41:31] eternal life
[1:41:34] that eternal life
[1:41:36] is a part of God
[1:41:40] put into you and I
[1:41:44] makes us his offspring
[1:41:48] so no matter what you think there was
[1:41:50] something about you that God did like
[1:41:55] but yet he offers it to everybody
[1:41:58] to where he's not a respecter person
[1:42:01] but he knows who will receive it and who
[1:42:02] won't
[1:42:04] do you say but I've got all these quotes
[1:42:06] brother they were the prophet said you
[1:42:07] always was eternal
[1:42:09] keep on reading as you're reading that
[1:42:12] and notice what he says if you have
[1:42:15] eternal life
[1:42:17] you always was eternal
[1:42:21] if you have eternal life that eternal
[1:42:24] life
[1:42:24] was eternal
[1:42:26] not the form of our being here not any
[1:42:30] of this
[1:42:33] Mom and Daddy had a way of bringing
[1:42:35] those things
[1:42:39] but yet before the world ever begun
[1:42:45] God's plan and purpose
[1:42:47] was not to have a Judas
[1:42:52] that would be lost
[1:42:55] remember he cannot
[1:42:58] cannot lose you and then try to save you
[1:43:02] just for some purpose like that
[1:43:08] he can't make you lost
[1:43:11] just to get to save you
[1:43:14] so he put us on three more agencies
[1:43:16] where we could choose
[1:43:18] though he placed Adam and Eve in the
[1:43:20] garden but yet knowing what they would
[1:43:22] do
[1:43:26] and when he did they turned him down but
[1:43:29] you know what Adam had eternal life and
[1:43:32] I believe Eve had eternal life in her
[1:43:33] soul
[1:43:35] why because brother Ryan said they had
[1:43:37] the same theophany
[1:43:39] that's what he says and they don't argue
[1:43:41] with me about it go to uh Janice
[1:43:43] question answer on Genesis
[1:43:50] they had eternal life given unto them
[1:43:53] imparted
[1:43:56] but yet the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:43:58] has eternal life by choosing
[1:44:02] they never chose to have it
[1:44:07] but we chose to have eternal life
[1:44:11] we accept him as our savior you know
[1:44:14] what then he accepts us
[1:44:20] but see the way people preach it they
[1:44:22] preach it with the same old calvinistics
[1:44:23] ideas and talks
[1:44:29] and it comes back to that one old thing
[1:44:33] that I talked about this morning
[1:44:36] that old ego
[1:44:41] that old ego
[1:44:45] when salvation
[1:44:47] has nothing to do
[1:44:50] with the Flesh of mankind
[1:44:57] they will be a day this flesh will be
[1:44:59] made Eternal why because we're going to
[1:45:01] where our father's at
[1:45:06] don't ever get in your mind that we were
[1:45:08] some kind of a little something running
[1:45:09] around up in heaven
[1:45:14] just get in your mind one thing brother
[1:45:16] Dale please
[1:45:19] there is only one God
[1:45:22] and that God is eternal
[1:45:24] and that God had to come down and some
[1:45:27] way and I can't explain it I don't know
[1:45:30] how he could come into you and I and
[1:45:33] give us eternal life
[1:45:36] can you explain what would cause that to
[1:45:38] happen
[1:45:40] without running into some form of a
[1:45:42] choosing
[1:45:44] I've done the best I could do 10 sermons
[1:45:46] to get you away from those things
[1:45:50] to think about something we could be the
[1:45:52] only thing we are is we accepted him
[1:45:56] that's what brother Dale I got word of
[1:45:58] prop amen I've been through that
[1:46:01] he said it's not whether you choose him
[1:46:03] or not that's whether he chose you
[1:46:07] and we were chosen remember
[1:46:09] in him
[1:46:11] so we remember the message
[1:46:15] it's not whether or not brother Mark
[1:46:18] that I'm chosen
[1:46:20] is whether or not he was chosen
[1:46:24] because if I'm in him and he chose him
[1:46:28] I've got it made
[1:46:32] are you listening
[1:46:35] God chose Jesus Christ to die for our
[1:46:37] sins
[1:46:39] you know the whole story he didn't
[1:46:42] choose another person a second person or
[1:46:44] a son he came himself
[1:46:47] that's why I don't believe in many gods
[1:46:50] if you believe that you are a son of
[1:46:53] Jesus which were the son of God
[1:46:56] you're a grandchild
[1:47:03] is that simple
[1:47:05] but now if you believe that Jesus was
[1:47:08] God
[1:47:10] the Eternal God dwelling in flesh
[1:47:14] and that old Calvary he could rip that
[1:47:16] life out the prophet says it
[1:47:21] because he was body of creation
[1:47:24] Hebrews 11 5 the body that has made me
[1:47:27] the Run said the father made it for him
[1:47:30] you explain it
[1:47:33] but inside of him was a very Spirit of
[1:47:35] almighty God in the very soul of
[1:47:37] almighty God
[1:47:40] and when he died on Calvary he released
[1:47:42] that Spirit it went back to God
[1:47:44] he could come back and anoint people to
[1:47:46] be anointed yes
[1:47:48] with the very Soul was the one that went
[1:47:50] to pay my price in hell
[1:47:52] the scroll the spirit the person the
[1:47:55] prophet said of his being the theophany
[1:48:00] and see then when that
[1:48:03] person that you and I when we die to
[1:48:05] ourselves through justification
[1:48:07] sanctification the cleansing of the
[1:48:09] vessel
[1:48:11] getting the soul cleaned enough the word
[1:48:14] God could come in
[1:48:16] and bring his own life
[1:48:19] the prophet said it's you and God and I
[1:48:21] are together as persons you can't
[1:48:23] explain that because he's not talking
[1:48:25] about two people
[1:48:28] it's not you and God and there's two
[1:48:30] different persons
[1:48:32] it's God who has given eternal life to
[1:48:35] your soul
[1:48:40] and that's a child of God
[1:48:43] that's a offspring of God
[1:48:47] you see why we need a new birth more
[1:48:49] than anything
[1:48:51] yes but brother Dale I believe the
[1:48:52] message I shouted what we just read
[1:48:55] as your Prophet said you can do every
[1:48:56] bit of that and still be lost
[1:48:59] you tell me the devil don't believe this
[1:49:01] message
[1:49:03] until you need to wake up
[1:49:06] he knows more about it you and I do
[1:49:11] but he's also smart enough until
[1:49:13] I watch very carefully what I read
[1:49:19] maybe I shouldn't say this I'm too blunt
[1:49:21] I guess
[1:49:22] I find too many mistakes
[1:49:28] in a lot of the books I read
[1:49:34] I'll be glad someday to go through them
[1:49:36] with you
[1:49:37] now I'm not throwing off on them people
[1:49:39] because heaven helped the people that
[1:49:41] was translating them and bringing it out
[1:49:42] they've done the best they could do but
[1:49:44] if you punctuate this thing wrong
[1:49:48] you're changing the very thought
[1:49:54] but thank God for what we've got come on
[1:49:57] Church
[1:50:03] but even a tape
[1:50:06] I can't do it now with these mp3s and
[1:50:10] things now Richard can because he's got
[1:50:11] the ability
[1:50:15] but in them old type days I could cut
[1:50:17] and splice a tape so perfect until you'd
[1:50:20] never know that I'd cut that tape and
[1:50:22] took part of it out
[1:50:24] because we couldn't afford to send back
[1:50:25] after new tapes every time one got broke
[1:50:28] we had to cut them and put them back
[1:50:30] together right brother Ray
[1:50:32] so we know we were losing maybe a word
[1:50:34] or something but
[1:50:36] you can make bread around say anything
[1:50:37] you want to
[1:50:41] but there's one thing about it if I have
[1:50:44] the spirit of almighty God
[1:50:47] Living In My Soul by the new birth I'm
[1:50:50] not worried about who's trying to
[1:50:52] misinterpret
[1:50:55] or mistranslate
[1:50:57] I'm depending on him
[1:51:03] to bring a message
[1:51:06] what do you think about it
[1:51:09] God will never again dwell alone
[1:51:14] and once he started condescending this
[1:51:16] way
[1:51:17] he started bringing himself into being
[1:51:24] and he brings Jehovah into being
[1:51:27] and he says I'll be like a father with a
[1:51:29] family
[1:51:32] eternal life what does it mean to you
[1:51:33] well I always was eternal I got all
[1:51:36] these quotes I always was eternal I
[1:51:37] don't have to be saved brother Dale I've
[1:51:39] had people to say that
[1:51:44] I've heard a lot of preachers say that
[1:51:45] that you've listened to
[1:51:49] that's why I said finds you had to
[1:51:50] listen very carefully
[1:51:52] to brother Dale
[1:51:54] and anybody else
[1:52:00] yeah but brother Dale you're too sweet
[1:52:01] of a guy you know better than that I
[1:52:04] don't have to explain that part
[1:52:05] you know this ain't no sweet old guy
[1:52:08] this guy's fighting for his life
[1:52:13] and emotional fighting for yours
[1:52:17] I'm trying to get you to at least have
[1:52:18] an ability to be able to receive the
[1:52:20] message correctly
[1:52:22] then what you do with it after then I
[1:52:24] can't my kids are not saved because
[1:52:26] they're my kids
[1:52:32] but God did say you will be there with
[1:52:34] your Offspring so if I can believe it
[1:52:37] then I'll accept it
[1:52:43] what do we think about it
[1:52:45] God to never dwell alone
[1:52:51] that he could save Jacob
[1:52:53] but he'd know what Esau would do
[1:52:59] so we could go ahead and write it down
[1:53:07] see then we're proving our
[1:53:08] predestination come on brothers
[1:53:10] we're proving what we are
[1:53:14] I don't have to prove a thing brother
[1:53:15] Dale
[1:53:17] if you don't live a Christian Life
[1:53:19] you sure ain't an example
[1:53:28] it's got to be in him isn't it
[1:53:31] what are we going to sing boys
[1:53:37] I am blessed okay I know I am
[1:53:40] you know
[1:53:43] okay
[1:53:44] let's say you guys Stand Together
[1:53:55] okay boys go ahead
[1:54:03] yeah I'm glad
[1:54:07] I am blessed
[1:54:12] every day that I live if I am blessed
[1:54:18] right
[1:54:20] when I wake up in the morning when I lay
[1:54:26] my head not till I left because you cut
[1:54:29] your day short
[1:54:33] I am blessed thinking unto him I am
[1:54:41] I am I am blessed
[1:54:47] every day that I live I am I'm blessed
[1:54:55] when I wake up in the morning when I lay
[1:55:01] my head to that
[1:55:04] I am blessed
[1:55:09] but
[1:55:12] I am blessed
[1:55:17] I am but
[1:55:22] eternal life what does it mean to you
[1:55:28] means a difference of whether or not
[1:55:29] that I'm saved
[1:55:34] run around and got in the field one got
[1:55:36] over the seventh seal and what'd he say
[1:55:39] the one with the same simple message
[1:55:43] is it called if you don't you work
[1:55:46] yourself away from it
[1:55:48] what is the same simple message
[1:55:55] and on that future home
[1:55:58] come at a place we go to right
[1:56:02] right in the middle of it he said if you
[1:56:05] don't get nothing else he said you get
[1:56:08] this Plan of Salvation
[1:56:14] most marvelous message
[1:56:19] you know about page 15 16 and read what
[1:56:22] he says about the new birth
[1:56:25] how you're Justified
[1:56:27] how you're Sanctified the unclean Spirit
[1:56:29] goes out and how that Holy Spirit comes
[1:56:31] and lives in you they folks be talking
[1:56:34] about a world for us to go to you
[1:56:37] realize that we're not if we don't
[1:56:39] become any children here we won't become
[1:56:42] his children die
[1:56:43] I hope you understand that form
[1:56:47] even though that those who get eternal
[1:56:49] life into white Throne will not be the
[1:56:52] Sons and Daughters of the Living God
[1:56:55] they will be impartation
[1:57:00] imparted unto him
[1:57:02] because you came
[1:57:07] fall is not too bad if we get on the
[1:57:09] right Channel
[1:57:11] think about Redemption
[1:57:13] remember
[1:57:17] redeemed
[1:57:19] means to go back
[1:57:21] where you come from
[1:57:25] right
[1:57:27] if you only go back
[1:57:30] to his full knowledge
[1:57:34] you're not redeemed
[1:57:39] I'd put that in my account and think
[1:57:41] about it
[1:57:42] if you want to go back to foreknowledge
[1:57:45] you're not fully redeemed
[1:57:48] redeem means to go back where you come
[1:57:50] from
[1:57:52] if you wasn't there you never will be
[1:57:54] there
[1:57:58] that's why the prophet will say if you
[1:58:01] have eternal life
[1:58:02] the eternal life you have never had a
[1:58:06] beginning and never had an ending
[1:58:11] not to do it let's sing ain't God good
