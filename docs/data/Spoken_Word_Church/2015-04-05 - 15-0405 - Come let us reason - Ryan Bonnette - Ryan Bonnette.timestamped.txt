[0:37] lesson this morning not to be
[0:39] misunderstood or is that she's just
[0:41] helped me to give this thought to the
[0:43] people in the way that you gave it to me
[0:44] father and may all be For Your Glory and

[0:48] we pray to bless all those travel and

[0:52] and keep them safe
[0:53] I love you we thank you and give you all
[0:56] the praise for all your blessings
[1:01] all right so we're going to talk about
[1:05] uh come let us freezer I want to say
[1:08] right up front
[1:09] uh don't misunderstand me because I'm
[1:11] not saying that
[1:13] way uh
[1:15] I don't think misunderstood that we have
[1:17] to reason things to uh make ourselves
[1:20] get Revelation from God we can't make
[1:22] God reveal things to us I'm only talking
[1:24] about our part to do okay our part is
[1:27] more than just sitting and waiting on
[1:29] things sitting and waiting on a bus to
[1:31] pull up last time
[1:33] I talked about diligence and I gave you
[1:36] all the the keys about diligence about
[1:38] how to become diligent why we need
[1:40] diligence because we're soft and we're
[1:42] lazy we're born lazy and we're not just
[1:44] going to get things automatically we
[1:46] have to do something you know we have to
[1:48] work our part and God needs us halfway
[1:51] you know we talked about what diligence
[1:53] is and why it's important and uh but I
[1:55] left off on this one ingredient and it
[1:57] really didn't occur to me until
[1:58] afterward that I should have mentioned
[1:59] this and this is very important
[2:02] so come let us freezing
[2:05] part of being diligent in seeking the
[2:08] Lord is to set your mind on him
[2:10] think on his word hide it in your heart
[2:14] keep it always on your mind and he will
[2:16] begin to reveal it to you this is a
[2:19] vital aspect of the Christian Journey if
[2:21] you want to see God we must look at him
[2:23] let's turn Our Eyes Upon Jesus like the
[2:26] song says
[2:27] Psalm 16 8 I have set the lord always
[2:30] before me because he's at my right hand
[2:33] I shall not be moved
[2:39] and uh the scripture for this where it
[2:41] comes out of the Bible is in Isaiah
[2:44] 1 verse 18 come now and let us reason
[2:47] together saith the Lord though your sins
[2:50] be a Scarlet they shall be as white as
[2:53] snow so there be red like crimson and
[2:55] they shall be as wool
[2:57] this is all about
[2:59] mankind falling okay where his highest
[3:03] state that he was in the garden before
[3:04] the fall God reaching his hand down from
[3:06] heaven to pick mankind back up and he he
[3:10] does it through reasoning and and
[3:12] through lots of any Avenues he comes
[3:14] into our lives and and pulls man back up
[3:16] okay back to himself
[3:18] so let's talk about let's talk about
[3:19] your sin let's talk about your life and
[3:21] everything about you and who you are and
[3:23] why you're here and where you're going
[3:25] so come let us treason
[3:28] okay the word reason in the Hebrew
[3:30] lexicon means
[3:33] to prove to decide judge rebuke approve
[3:37] correct to be right or be right
[3:40] all right it means to decide so think
[3:42] about what uh what we must do we must
[3:45] decide when we hear the word we decide
[3:47] okay it comes into the womb of our mind
[3:50] and we make a a choice on it we make a
[3:53] conscious decision about the word of God
[3:56] the judge okay because also the word
[3:58] some work we receive is false word we
[4:00] also the devil speaks to us and gives us
[4:02] false work so we have to decide to
[4:05] discern between the spirits okay the
[4:08] judge
[4:09] to a judge a point to so to be right to
[4:12] prove to convince convict to approve
[4:16] tied to correct rebuke to be chasten to
[4:19] reason reason together to argue
[4:22] okay so just you know work it out within
[4:26] your being decide on what what you hear
[4:28] and then you can make a conscious
[4:30] decision okay
[4:33] so our objective this lesson is to see
[4:35] what it means to reason about the word
[4:37] that we hear and then to believe it
[4:43] hmm
[4:45] another thing I forgot to say on that
[4:46] last slide
[4:49] you notice it says uh rebuke when you
[4:52] hear false word come in
[4:54] that's where you cast down imaginations
[4:56] and every High thing that is also
[4:58] against the knowledge of God bring every
[5:00] thought and captivity to the beatings of
[5:02] Christ so you're a brief rebuke the
[5:05] false word that comes in okay
[5:10] all right
[5:15] oh another thing I forgot to mention on
[5:17] the on the objective slide okay for the
[5:20] random sorts of scripture himself you
[5:21] know when the angel of the Lord I think
[5:22] uh would speak something to brother
[5:24] Branham even then he'd go back and try
[5:26] the scripture right he'd go test it and
[5:28] see if this is really of God and God
[5:30] admired that God like that he doesn't
[5:32] want us to just take over here and say
[5:33] you know what that sounds good it must
[5:35] be right you know you have to go try it
[5:37] reason it out
[5:39] uh look at the scripture and see if it
[5:41] Compares okay
[5:44] so that was our example we should do
[5:45] that too
[5:46] uh first John 4 1 beloved belief not
[5:50] every Spirit but try the spirits whether
[5:53] they are of God because many false
[5:55] prophets are gone out into the world
[5:58] hereby I know ye the spirit of God every
[6:01] spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ
[6:03] is come in the flesh is of God
[6:06] and every spirit that confesseth not
[6:08] Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is
[6:10] not of God and this is that Spirit of
[6:12] antichrist wherefore where have ye have
[6:15] heard that it should come and even now
[6:17] already is it in the world
[6:20] okay like what does Riverdale always say
[6:22] compared to our new birth right when you
[6:24] hear anything at all compared to your
[6:26] own New Birth
[6:27] all right because Jesus Christ if you're
[6:29] born again he's come in the flesh he's
[6:30] come in your flesh compared to the word
[6:32] that you've received to the New Birth
[6:34] that you have and see if it rains true
[6:38] all right Satan wants to be God right
[6:41] that's been his whole goal he wants to
[6:43] be instead of God he wants to be
[6:45] worshiped as God
[6:46] so he won't declare that Jesus Christ
[6:50] Has Come In the Flesh he'll he'll point
[6:52] to himself every time he'll always try
[6:54] to get you off the work and he's very
[6:55] true and how he does it we have to be
[6:59] you know ready for that
[7:03] okay
[7:05] any questions so far
[7:09] doesn't go through this I don't want to
[7:11] go too fast
[7:16] say um we have to do things and God made
[7:19] us halfway I'm
[7:23] an artist
[7:26] yeah maybe we can do a little bit more
[7:29] more explanation okay well just anything
[7:32] in life I mean when you want God to do
[7:34] something you can't just say God do it
[7:36] and commit it to him a good example is
[7:38] my wife sitting there
[7:40] years ago I had a loan for a wife and
[7:42] brother Gary Atkins was a mentor to me
[7:44] he came down he saw he knew I was his
[7:46] own wife and he was lonely he said
[7:48] brother Ryan God will bring the right
[7:51] one in his time
[7:52] but you can't just sit in your living
[7:54] room and wait on God to drop a wife for
[7:56] you down through the floor
[7:58] down you have to keep your eyes open you
[8:02] have to look him but don't be dating
[8:04] don't be trying there's no need to try
[8:06] one and try another and try this try
[8:08] that just wait on God bring it but you
[8:10] have to keep your eyes open see that was
[8:12] my part be ready do everything my part
[8:14] to be ready
[8:15] the uh you know what I would think a
[8:17] good husband should be be ready to be
[8:20] that okay be a good Christian be serving
[8:21] the lord and then his part was to bring
[8:24] me alive and his time and he Vindicated
[8:26] and showed me that she was the one
[8:28] that's one example
[8:30] um I mean there's many examples uh you
[8:33] know basically we are not called to just
[8:35] sit and wait on God to do everything we
[8:38] have to study to show ourselves approved
[8:40] like the Bible says we have to keep
[8:43] seeking the Lord Lord serving the lord
[8:45] walking in his word and and he'll do the
[8:48] rest there is a part that we have that's
[8:50] that's what I'm saying does that make
[8:51] more sense
[8:53] so there's nothing really in the Bible
[8:55] that we're supposed to just sit and wait
[8:57] on God to do everything we uh we're
[9:00] we're supposed to we're supposed to be
[9:01] patient and then uh and in the meantime
[9:04] while we're waiting on God to fulfill
[9:06] what he said we keep studying keep
[9:08] praying keep believing believing unto
[9:10] until it's revealed that we're not
[9:12] believing on two anymore it's a
[9:13] revelation
[9:15] okay
[9:18] uh Second Timothy 2 15 study to show
[9:22] thyself approved unto God a Workman that
[9:25] needeth not to be ashamed rightly
[9:26] dividing the word of Truth
[9:28] but Sean profane and bablings for they
[9:32] will increase unto more ungodliness
[9:35] okay there's that false Doctrine again
[9:37] coming in you know Satan creeps saying
[9:39] very small unaware a little saying will
[9:41] go forth or something like that and it's
[9:43] just very very uh
[9:45] subtle right the way the Devil comes
[9:48] down
[9:49] without increase those are seeds that
[9:52] the devil's playing you know little
[9:53] things little foxes spoil the vine they
[9:55] start off as small little sayings they
[9:57] increase unto more ungodliness and their
[9:59] word will eat as thus a canker of whom
[10:01] is hymenius and fellatous
[10:04] who concerning the truth have aired
[10:06] saying that the resurrection is passed
[10:09] already and overthrow the faith of some
[10:12] nevertheless the foundation of God
[10:14] stands for having this seal
[10:16] to think about that but still because we
[10:18] know about the mark of the bees all
[10:20] right the mark that started there in the
[10:23] garden with Eve she took on the carnal
[10:24] mind we'll get into more of that but
[10:26] that's the carnal mind is imitating and
[10:28] Scar that's the mark of the things
[10:29] that's where you uh and the Seal of God
[10:32] is just the opposite you know the
[10:34] ability to believe the word of God when
[10:36] you make a decision to believe the word
[10:38] of God you're going on with God okay so
[10:41] didn't have their self the Lord knoweth
[10:43] them that are his do you see communion
[10:45] the Lord knoweth lamb that are his like
[10:48] brother Boston's on them out
[10:49] you're in a communion in a relationship
[10:51] with God
[10:53] and let everyone name it the name of
[10:55] Christ depart from iniquity
[11:02] okay
[11:05] so what are we
[11:07] We Are Spiritual Beings with the ability
[11:10] to reason and the ability to make free
[11:13] choice why now this is me talking I mean
[11:15] you may differ with this and tell me
[11:17] what you can do okay I'm not robbing
[11:19] everything and I frankly
[11:21] uh I used to be really afraid to say
[11:23] what I believe because I was afraid that
[11:25] somebody said Ryan you're wrong and then
[11:27] I'd say well I must not be born again
[11:29] but no I'm not really afraid of that
[11:30] anymore now I'm thinking let me say what
[11:32] I believe if you find something wrong
[11:34] show me because I want to be right so
[11:36] show me if you see where I've maybe
[11:37] reasoned off the word because I almost
[11:39] know all right we Are Spiritual Beings
[11:42] with the ability to reason and to make
[11:43] free choice why is what I'm saying
[11:45] because God needed to expand himself
[11:47] into another form he is ever expanding
[11:50] you know all of Heaven cannot contain
[11:53] God the heaven of Heavens cannot contain
[11:55] God he is ever expanding and becoming
[11:57] greater thus he needed a form to expand
[11:59] into him created in this image of
[12:01] lioness okay
[12:04] um
[12:09] he'd become a greater but not changing
[12:11] let me let me Express that part he's the
[12:14] same yesterday and forever but he can
[12:16] move over into other forms still the
[12:17] same God depressing himself and other
[12:19] forms moving over to another in another
[12:21] form okay
[12:24] now we are beings with a soul he can
[12:27] express in us his attributes furthermore
[12:29] he desires to be worshiped in spirit and
[12:32] in truth
[12:33] we are created to fulfill that we have
[12:35] the ability to reason and to make a
[12:36] choice to accept and reject the truth
[12:38] okay
[12:41] is that pretty clear I guess
[12:46] now
[12:50] all right
[12:54] the carnal mind before the fall of Man
[12:56] Adam and Eve had pure Minds the carnal
[12:59] mind did not enter man until the fall
[13:01] see that's just again me saying because
[13:03] I don't believe that God gave his great
[13:05] his creation his purpose perfect beings
[13:07] a carnal Minds because the carnal mind
[13:09] is to lust and it's to do all the wrong
[13:12] things I believe in Adam with pure minds
[13:14] but with the ability to reason see God
[13:17] gave mankind to build a reason and to
[13:19] make free choice this again was to
[13:21] enable us to reason on the things of God
[13:23] and to be able to receive Revelation or
[13:25] understand God like we do now after the
[13:28] fall okay so before the fall must have
[13:31] been I presume it would be the same way
[13:33] that man received God
[13:36] Galore came down himself and communed
[13:38] with them in the garden and reason with
[13:40] them and they could understand things
[13:41] about God the obvious byproduct which is
[13:44] a dirty word these days in the message
[13:46] the byproduct or unintended consequence
[13:49] of this is that we can choose wrong
[13:51] right because if you give man the
[13:54] ability to make right and wrong choices
[13:55] at some point he could choose wrong
[13:58] or accept false word and reject the word
[14:01] of God that is what the woman did in the
[14:04] garden she accepted the LIE from the
[14:05] devil and thus took on the carnal mind
[14:08] you know brother Brandon might be on the
[14:10] curtain of Tom he said that he could hug
[14:12] the women and feel that they were really
[14:13] women but there was no sensation or no I
[14:16] think he was meaning I assuming was
[14:18] being a stimulation all right
[14:20] because there was no sex glands there
[14:22] was no ability to go off in the wrong
[14:24] direction like that so that being that
[14:28] way there must have been that way in the
[14:30] garden because their eyes were valid
[14:33] they did not know they were naked so
[14:35] Adam and Eve had pure minds and really
[14:38] no ability to do the wrong things the
[14:42] lusting things until she accepted that
[14:44] idea from the devil from sacrum
[14:47] is that is that all right okay
[14:52] now
[14:57] like like Paul said in Romans
[15:00] on carnal sold understands he sold us
[15:03] out and Adam sold us out understand the
[15:05] carnal Minds so now we're all born with
[15:07] this Karma this enmity against God
[15:16] okay so Romans 12 2. and they not
[15:20] conform to this world but be you
[15:22] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[15:24] that you may prove what is that good and
[15:27] acceptable and perfect will of God
[15:31] I saw a part of this has proven the will
[15:34] of God the word his will is his word
[15:36] okay
[15:38] now this to me is how to get rid of the
[15:40] carnal mind
[15:42] all right because we're born with it we
[15:44] don't need it we need to get rid of it
[15:45] and how do we get rid of it
[15:47] see there it is right there again B not
[15:49] conform to this world but be transformed
[15:51] by the renewing of your mind we take on
[15:53] the mind of Christ that this mind this
[15:56] is Philippians 2 5 let this mind be in
[15:59] you which also was in Christ Jesus who
[16:02] being not in the form of God thought or
[16:03] not robbery to be equal with God but
[16:05] made himself no reputation took upon him
[16:08] the form of a servant and was made in
[16:10] the likeness of men
[16:12] and being found in fashion as a man he
[16:14] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[16:17] the death even the death death of the
[16:19] Cross so he walked in the will of God
[16:21] the word of God
[16:23] it became obedient all right obedience
[16:26] is better than sacrifice so we're
[16:28] supposed to not be conformed to the
[16:30] world to be obedient to God
[16:32] killing this or doing away with this
[16:34] carnal nature that we've been given
[16:37] and Walking with God
[16:40] John 8 32 says truth the truth shall
[16:44] make you free you should know the truth
[16:46] and the truth shall make you feel free
[16:48] so again reason you study the word of
[16:51] God you reason it out you think about it
[16:53] and then hiding your heart like David
[16:56] said hide it hide the word in your heart
[16:58] God will come and Quicken it to you
[17:00] he'll make it alive
[17:02] uh John 16 13.
[17:05] oh
[17:07] where he's spiritual truth has come he
[17:09] will lead you and guide you into all
[17:10] truth
[17:13] that's like we're supposed to be on the
[17:14] next slide excuse me
[17:18] an example of
[17:20] obedient as opposed to greater than for
[17:22] sacrifice
[17:25] uh let's say I came just came into my
[17:28] mind to stand is that a quarter
[17:30] scripture let's see that's a that's a
[17:31] quote I think right brother
[17:34] obedience is better sacrifice in the
[17:36] scripture okay uh I'd say what would be
[17:40] an example of that one well what's an
[17:42] example of sacrifice in that reference
[17:45] you know I guess I'll have to look up
[17:47] that scripture now because I might have
[17:48] taken those context but I'm thinking
[17:50] that in the Old Testament they made
[17:53] sacrifices all right for him to cover it
[17:56] for a time but what's even better than
[17:59] that is to come over here while you're
[18:00] born again the perfect sacrifice has
[18:02] been made his life comes and living
[18:03] lives in you God carrying out his own
[18:05] word in you and making you obedient so
[18:08] rather than committing sin you know
[18:11] iniquity and going back and making the
[18:13] same sacrifice over and over again
[18:15] rather than that why not come over and
[18:18] receive a new birth
[18:20] and then they'll make you obedient and
[18:22] that'll Purge you from I don't know
[18:23] that's just my speculation
[18:27] okay because the Albanian to God
[18:31] right because
[18:33] see how big it the God will yeah because
[18:36] the sacrifice became a stinking it's
[18:38] nostril men were doing it for just uh
[18:41] for a routine you know for a tradition
[18:44] right public sacrifice say I never
[18:48] committed anything but they sacrificing
[18:50] did you need a second say that again now
[18:52] if you never made a mistake did you need
[18:55] a sacrifice in the Old Testament I
[18:57] wonder oh everybody
[18:59] made mistakes I mean that there was
[19:01] nobody in that in that uh
[19:04] you know in that realm we have Barney
[19:06] standing iniquity the only thing is they
[19:08] had to realize that they were in sin
[19:11] because if anybody thought they didn't
[19:12] make a mistake it was because the law
[19:14] hadn't manifested that to him yet
[19:17] because Paul said you know I had not
[19:19] known sin left to be by the law so when
[19:22] the law came that showed that there were
[19:24] Sinners so they couldn't say anymore
[19:25] that I I don't need to sacrifice
[19:27] everybody needed to for some reason or
[19:29] another I thought maybe if you never
[19:31] made a mistakes and you were two or not
[19:33] to kill he didn't go kill right be that
[19:36] you probably didn't need a sacrifice it
[19:39] was killed him yeah
[19:42] even if they hadn't murdered somebody
[19:44] physically Jesus came and magnified the
[19:47] law and now you're talking about Old
[19:48] Testament yeah I'm trying to see if that
[19:51] answers her a few
[19:54] if I didn't kill
[19:55] I didn't need to go make an offer so if
[19:59] I obeyed
[20:01] not to keep you then I didn't mean to
[20:03] make any sacrifice but not for that
[20:06] specifically maybe but up besides God
[20:09] we're all Filthy our righteousness is a
[20:11] filthy rack so there's nothing that you
[20:13] wouldn't need some sacrifice for
[20:15] somewhere
[20:16] that's right you know what I'm saying
[20:17] even in the Old Testament even before
[20:18] Jesus magnified the law because he came
[20:20] and magnified and said if you even hate
[20:22] your brother Without a Cause
[20:26] even without literally committing
[20:28] adultery you've made adults with it
[20:29] already in your heart
[20:30] so everybody is has come short of the
[20:34] glory of God by a long ways we are a
[20:36] long ways
[20:39] I had this guy I try to trap me or
[20:42] something I think he knew the answer to
[20:44] me so I say we if you're a True Believer
[20:47] be a Christian do you sin he's trying to
[20:50] Reverend said we sin every day even if
[20:52] we just don't ask your neighbor to go to
[20:56] church with you
[20:58] yeah say yeah listen every day as long
[20:59] as you're in this right here yeah right
[21:01] exactly he knew the answer but he was
[21:03] trying to see what I would say yeah he
[21:05] thought you'd be self-righteous or
[21:07] something well I mean we're all and
[21:09] president said we stick it to the change
[21:11] so as long as we have the coronation
[21:12] we're going to be doing things
[21:16] um
[21:19] were commanded to have uh these days a
[21:23] certain periods of the year and they
[21:26] would always accompany the sacrifice
[21:28] right so they were doing it as an
[21:30] ordinance and not seeing numbers right
[21:32] okay yeah exactly it's just man's carnal
[21:36] nature because they still have the
[21:37] carnal mind as we do and we're still
[21:39] trying to battle with and so we
[21:42] automatically into tradition and just
[21:43] doing things out of her team forget why
[21:46] it's there you know so
[21:50] I don't remember if I read that song I
[21:51] don't know if you read the one prior to
[21:53] it okay
[21:55] you get to be my age
[22:05] you're right
[22:07] the revelation of Jesus Christ preached
[22:10] 1960 1204. now bless the word the
[22:15] announcement of the blessing on the
[22:16] third person condemned the radar here
[22:18] it's Mysteries make okay
[22:21] the carnal mind shuns it because the
[22:23] carnal mind knows not a thing about it
[22:25] no wonder the carnal mind doesn't know
[22:27] it because it's Satan in that part of
[22:30] mind and Satan is exposed and Satan does
[22:33] not want himself exposed then he goes on
[22:35] to about the Genesis Revelation how that
[22:37] Satan tries to hide those two books it
[22:40] needs to be exposed he's very subtle and
[22:42] wants to be hidden
[22:43] he used to do his work without being
[22:46] known okay
[22:47] we've got to find myself in here hold on
[22:53] okay
[23:04] okay this is the man that took that eve
[23:07] took on in the garden okay
[23:10] the Satan in the carnal mind now
[23:15] Matthew 11 2.
[23:18] and from the days of John the Baptist
[23:20] until now the Kingdom of Heaven
[23:22] suffereth violence and the violent take
[23:24] it by force y'all remember Bob bringing
[23:26] this out a while back maybe a year ago I
[23:28] guess and that scripture really struck
[23:31] something in me when he brought that out
[23:32] I've never seen that like that but
[23:35] uh basically
[23:37] it helps us to see that we are to fight
[23:39] against the carnal mind this is not some
[23:41] you know lazy sit down and wait on God
[23:44] like I said wait on God to do everything
[23:46] this is something we're in a battle and
[23:48] we're fighting and the kingdom of God
[23:50] suffers violence we have to be a violent
[23:52] Christian you know daily walking and
[23:54] pushing and striving don't ever stop
[23:56] don't ever back down
[23:57] and even if you fall get right up and
[24:00] keep on fighting again that's the point
[24:02] of that
[24:04] so second Corinthians 10 4 for the
[24:06] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[24:08] But Mighty through God to the pulling
[24:11] down of strongholds casting down
[24:13] imaginations in every High thing that
[24:15] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[24:16] God and bring into captivity every
[24:19] thought to The Obedience of Christ
[24:21] like an Ephesians it's Ephesians 6 11
[24:24] the whole armor of God you'll remember
[24:25] the armor of God
[24:27] uh the pajamas the blanket the pillow
[24:30] The Pacifier is that the armor of God
[24:33] you know that would be if you're gonna
[24:35] sit and Grumble my brother Joe's been
[24:37] talking about growing balloon line and
[24:39] complained like a baby you know the
[24:41] armor of God is Warfare armor it's armor
[24:44] that a soldier would wear to fight so
[24:46] that gives you some sort of uh clue huh
[24:49] you put on the word right exactly you
[24:52] got too many babies that's your problem
[24:53] yeah
[24:57] but uh it's a shield helmet and a sword
[24:59] a breastplate these are things that
[25:01] we're supposed to fight with so we're
[25:02] not supposed to sit and just take it
[25:04] easy we're in violent Christians is what
[25:06] we're supposed to be
[25:08] my Jacob wrestling with the answer to
[25:10] the Lord you know he wouldn't let that
[25:11] answer go until he got a blessing so
[25:13] we're supposed to wrestle with God you
[25:15] know and say God I want your word I want
[25:17] the understanding of it and I want
[25:18] revelation
[25:20] and just stay with God and stay in the
[25:22] word
[25:23] all right now this is kind of Juicy it's
[25:26] off the subject a little bit
[25:28] the subject is think on these things
[25:29] this is what brother Dell always talks
[25:31] about
[25:32] at the end of almost every sermon he
[25:34] says think on these things
[25:36] I was just going to put that in here
[25:37] just for more support to my argument
[25:39] here but then I saw something the other
[25:42] day within that scripture I want to ask
[25:45] y'all if y'all see it just read that
[25:47] scripture finally Brethren what service
[25:48] things are true or certain things are
[25:51] honest well certain things are just
[25:53] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[25:55] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[25:57] a good report if there be any virtue and
[26:00] if there'll be any praise think on these
[26:02] things is anything shout out at y'all
[26:05] about that whole scripture again the
[26:07] things that he's mentioned in there
[26:11] anybody raise a hand
[26:13] what's shouting out of them scripture
[26:15] anything I think it's the word of God
[26:17] who's whatever is true and honest and
[26:20] all that exactly it's worth God but
[26:22] specifically
[26:25] this just occurs to me you know here's
[26:27] why here's why I saw this because in a
[26:29] trial the trial is over here a while
[26:30] back where she nearly died okay the
[26:32] first thing one thing that I saw
[26:35] was that God manifested to me and is
[26:37] that he is perfect he is perpetually
[26:39] perfect I mean perfect on top of perfect
[26:42] on top of perfect in that trowel y'all
[26:44] remember I talked about fours and about
[26:46] deliverance and those things that I kept
[26:48] saying that were evidence that God was
[26:50] there okay I didn't directly see God
[26:53] appear to me in this trial all I saw was
[26:55] that evidence that he was there like you
[26:58] know uh was it Hebrews 11 1 now Faith is
[27:01] substantive things hoped for the
[27:02] evidence of things knocks things and it
[27:05] was evident that God was there because
[27:07] the things he did in the Bible he was
[27:08] doing right in the middle of our trial
[27:10] and the more I thought on it the more I
[27:12] began to realize how much God was there
[27:13] so I saw God as being perfect
[27:15] so then I thought well you know based on
[27:17] that if he's perfect these must not be
[27:20] just a bunch of random things that Paul
[27:23] just mentioning here because I always
[27:24] thought this was just an optimistic
[27:26] scripture be optimistic uh positive
[27:28] thinking just think on some good things
[27:30] just find some good things and think
[27:31] about it there's more to it than that so
[27:33] I started studying into looking into
[27:35] what those are
[27:37] that is the entire Christian journey in
[27:39] one verse from start to finish
[27:42] what serves things are true what happens
[27:44] first you hear the word right you're
[27:47] introduced let's say you're not even a
[27:48] Christian at all I'll just use men's
[27:49] example when I was a baby I was born and
[27:51] raised in the Baptist Church mom and dad
[27:54] coming to church I heard the word my
[27:56] Grandma sat down and read Bible stories
[27:58] with me when I went to stay with her on
[27:59] weekends and things
[28:01] so I receive the truth
[28:05] all right
[28:06] wasn't even today's accountability yet
[28:08] but the word of God was being planted to
[28:10] me in letter form okay the truth
[28:13] and then it caused me to be honest later
[28:15] on I receive accountability and I became
[28:16] to the point where the word was shining
[28:18] on the darkness in my life like I was
[28:20] telling you about the word was shine on
[28:22] that darkness and showing that there's
[28:23] sin
[28:24] you know no matter how good I thought I
[28:26] was there was sin there so the light of
[28:28] the words show on that
[28:29] and caused me to confess for all sin
[28:32] control of the glory of God so I was
[28:34] honest with God honest with myself but
[28:36] whatever things are just pure and lovely
[28:39] justification sanctification back to the
[28:43] Holy Spirit the love of God is shed
[28:44] abroad in your heart God is love so what
[28:47] sort of things are lovely God you know
[28:49] just pure and lovely think about your
[28:52] journey all right and then once whatever
[28:55] things are of good report
[28:57] so what do you have after you're born
[28:59] again the law the life of God living
[29:00] through is no longer I that lives now
[29:02] it's Christ that liveth in me so that'll
[29:04] help make your life a good rapport say
[29:07] and then the testimonies the trials the
[29:10] sufferings the things you go through
[29:11] that overcame by the word of their
[29:13] testimony the Bible says we stand up
[29:15] there and testify that's not some little
[29:17] thing that's a big something that's an
[29:18] overcoming and each of those overcoming
[29:20] show Christ to us
[29:22] so it gives a good report in our life
[29:25] written a pistols read of all men a good
[29:27] report if there be any virtue
[29:29] statue of a perfect man the virtues what
[29:32] do you do after you get born again just
[29:34] in case they kissing back to the Holy
[29:35] Spirit puts you in the pyramid in faith
[29:37] Foundation then you start up the virtues
[29:40] all right and then if there be any
[29:42] praise the whole point of this is for
[29:44] God to receive absolute praise in the
[29:47] life of obedient Sons and Daughters of
[29:49] God so the whole thing is the Christian
[29:52] Journey what does Paul saying finally
[29:53] brethren think on these things your
[29:56] whole Christian experience where you've
[29:58] been where you are and where you're
[29:59] going see your whole entire life think
[30:02] about it where God brought you from
[30:03] where he's bringing you to and where you
[30:04] are now
[30:05] you know I was thinking whatever they
[30:07] say let this mind be in you I always
[30:11] look at the verses about that he said
[30:13] let nothing be done in vain glory Lord
[30:16] but in lowliness of mine you know and
[30:19] that's that's just bringing the what
[30:22] you're talking about right the Christian
[30:24] Life he said let this mind be in you to
[30:27] do what it says in verse two and three
[30:29] what's question three well it says
[30:32] fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded
[30:34] having the same love being the one of
[30:37] court or one mind let nothing be done
[30:39] through Strife or vain Glory but in
[30:42] lowliness of mine Let each esteem the
[30:45] other better than themselves look not
[30:47] every man on his own things but every
[30:50] man on also on the things of others and
[30:52] that just pulls all of that in exactly
[30:54] that's the mind he wants us to have yeah
[30:57] a lowly mind not hotline of things like
[31:00] things that exalt yourself or exalt the
[31:02] devil but the low things all right and
[31:05] run fresh out of time
[31:08] see oh that just I wrote that all out
[31:12] all the things I just said basically
[31:14] I don't think we're gonna finish
[31:16] um
[31:17] say we're right here
[31:20] okay I'll see how far I'm get but this
[31:23] is just more expounding on that last
[31:24] verse out of the mountain faves and
[31:26] sufferings has thou ordained strength
[31:28] because of thine enemies that thou might
[31:30] have steal the enemy and the Avenger I
[31:33] Psalm 82 so have an alpha bags and
[31:37] cycling so when you come here you're a
[31:38] babe you Christ and then he perfected
[31:41] praise and then Jesus went back and
[31:43] voted that
[31:45] Christmas David that's for Jesus the
[31:47] hairstyle what they say in Jesus said a
[31:49] damn gay have you never read out of the
[31:50] mountains of babes and sucklings have
[31:52] style perfected praise
[31:55] he wants to be worshiped in spirit and
[31:57] the truth
[31:58] and then more expounding on that same
[32:00] scripture his love this is just showing
[32:02] okay perfect love cast out fear love and
[32:05] faith is the same thing when you come to
[32:07] Faith in the pyramid you're coming to
[32:10] love the love of God uh love perfect
[32:12] love castes out
[32:14] fear which gives Faith you know just in
[32:16] a baby form of Faith baby form of of the
[32:19] love of God
[32:20] begotten all right
[32:23] what time do we normally stop exactly 10
[32:25] 25
[32:27] or 10 30. yeah 10 25. yeah
[32:36] yeah more on this later y'all go
[32:38] upstairs any questions
[33:14] all right okay
