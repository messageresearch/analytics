[31:29] as we try to minister your word lord and
[31:31] under these
[31:32] awful situations of life but yet still
[31:35] we're able to exist
[31:37] and be able to communicate and to bring
[31:40] forth the word
[31:41] and it can go out on the internet and
[31:43] travel to
[31:44] many different nations and things lord
[31:46] in it all
[31:47] to where that the people can hear if
[31:49] they want to

[31:58] need anymore we'll try our best to do it
[32:01] and get everything running in your order
[32:03] and your ways because we're not afraid
[32:05] of this thing
[32:06] we're just respecting the government the
[32:09] the things the people
[32:10] and doing everything to do just the best
[32:13] we can do
[32:14] and just leave it into your hands father
[32:16] we love you and we thank you
[32:18] in jesus name amen
[32:21] all right we've been reading this on
[32:23] ephesians and
[32:24] probably keep on for a little bit anyway
[32:27] so we'll just go to verse 3
[32:29] blessed be the god and father of our
[32:31] lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[32:33] with all
[32:33] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[32:36] where
[32:37] in christ according as he had chosen us
[32:40] in him all right when
[32:44] see we're not getting back there nailing
[32:46] it down yet
[32:48] we're wanting it to linger inward i
[32:51] don't know where to be right way but i
[32:52] want to bring it slowly and gradually
[32:55] progressing into the point of getting
[32:57] back before the foundation of the world
[33:00] all right so i hope you understand
[33:01] that's what we're doing because that's
[33:03] where we're having to go to
[33:05] to find out where the choosing was done
[33:08] and where was it done before the
[33:10] foundation of the world
[33:12] that we would we should be holding
[33:14] without blind before him
[33:16] in love okay now let's go over to
[33:18] revelation
[33:19] 3 14 because that's the day we're here
[33:22] the message of this day
[33:23] and unto the angel of the church of the
[33:25] lady of siam's right
[33:27] these things saith the amen the faithful
[33:29] and true witness
[33:30] the beginning of the creation of god
[33:34] you may be seated the lord that is
[33:35] blessing to
[33:37] the reading of the word now if you don't
[33:39] understand what we're doing
[33:41] ask somebody to get everything into
[33:43] order
[33:44] to where we can operate and uh
[33:48] do because that's the point all right
[33:51] now
[33:52] we have been dealing for quite a while
[33:55] on
[33:57] predestination talking about it and
[34:00] seeing how that
[34:02] god does his predestinating
[34:07] his ordaining his for ordaining
[34:10] how that he does his work and he does
[34:13] not
[34:14] uh do it in the basis of
[34:18] doing anything wrong by it or doing in
[34:21] saying choosing one and not choosing the
[34:23] other
[34:25] he does it by our own by our
[34:28] acceptance if we we don't accept him as
[34:31] our savior then he will not take care of
[34:33] the
[34:34] problem that we have but we are put into
[34:36] that order
[34:38] all right and we've been dealing with
[34:39] that about
[34:41] for knowledge because how does god
[34:44] predestinate
[34:46] he predestinates by his foreknowledge
[34:49] now that way you could as long as you i
[34:51] hope you've followed it if you haven't
[34:53] asked me questions about it whatever to
[34:56] do
[34:57] because we're trying to get it to a
[34:58] basis of understanding
[35:01] because i'm a firm believer in
[35:03] foreknowledge
[35:04] now by foreknowledge i can take then
[35:07] the message now i'm not saying smart
[35:11] adequately or anything i'm saying it and
[35:12] the best i can do
[35:13] because 50 years studying on something
[35:15] you ought to know a little bit about it
[35:17] okay and we've been studying the message
[35:20] and
[35:20] and comparing it and bringing it down
[35:23] and i see no
[35:25] contradictions in things i sleep slip
[35:28] with the tongues now we're going to deal
[35:29] with something today
[35:32] that we're going to talk about two
[35:33] creations
[35:35] and you know to try to get an
[35:37] understanding because the reason to do
[35:39] it
[35:40] you say uh what's the first creation
[35:43] all right if you've read christ's
[35:45] mystery god reveal you'll automatically
[35:46] say
[35:47] angels right
[35:50] because that's the word he uses there
[35:53] but if you are listening to masterpiece
[35:58] et cetera you may find
[36:01] something else if you're going to
[36:03] questions and answers
[36:05] you will go back far enough to find out
[36:07] god was his first creation
[36:12] that's according to the way you're
[36:14] reading and see that's what what
[36:16] does it and people misunderstand when
[36:19] you say
[36:20] you know you say what's first creation i
[36:21] say god says first grace
[36:23] no it wasn't the angels in his first
[36:25] creation well now we're going to get
[36:27] into that
[36:28] to try to understand because uh if you
[36:32] get
[36:32] don't get nothing get this there is a
[36:34] natural creation
[36:36] and a spiritual creation amen
[36:39] so we're going to talk about two
[36:41] creations all right a natural creation
[36:43] and a spiritual creation god created
[36:46] natural
[36:47] what which would be tangible or uh uh
[36:50] you know things like that and he created
[36:54] a spiritual people
[36:56] in things all right see that way when
[36:59] you read
[37:00] the christ of history and you're reading
[37:01] and he says the first is angels
[37:03] you say well well well that brother said
[37:06] it was was
[37:07] was a spiritual here he's he's angels
[37:11] well it'll it'll come out to the right
[37:13] place
[37:15] you know if we'll just settle down and
[37:17] listen
[37:19] to what the prophet is trying to bring
[37:21] in the scriptures is trying to bring
[37:23] unto us
[37:24] to see it because see we've got for the
[37:26] part that we've
[37:28] talked about the uh
[37:31] foreknowledge that god foreknew all
[37:35] things the scripture
[37:36] says all right and he predestinates by
[37:38] his foreknowledge
[37:41] that way he doesn't pick and choose
[37:44] so now let's don't get it when we get
[37:46] back into the mind of god
[37:49] and back on up into whatever boy he he
[37:52] chose me
[37:54] you know well see we get into all of
[37:56] that we get our thoughts in
[37:58] involved and and then we miss the whole
[38:00] thing you say yeah but uh
[38:02] have you accepted him no i haven't i
[38:04] didn't need to accept him i always was
[38:06] eternal
[38:09] now what kind of a doctrine do you have
[38:12] you have the doctrine of the quote
[38:16] basics of the people of this message
[38:19] that they believe you always was eternal
[38:22] you always had eternal life
[38:24] you come with eternal life you don't
[38:26] need to be saved you say well
[38:28] where's those people have do i have to
[38:31] play the tape
[38:32] for you i mean do i have to go with you
[38:36] and sit down in the pubic side of you
[38:38] and say are you listening
[38:40] did you hear what he said
[38:43] he said i see well i'm just trying to
[38:46] make it as silly as i can
[38:48] to where you'll think about it you ought
[38:50] to listen
[38:52] listen to what i say i want you to
[38:54] listen to what i think
[38:56] amen we were listening pretty good there
[38:59] the other day we caught wade two times
[39:00] on
[39:01] and changing the days of the week didn't
[39:03] we he wound up take making the first day
[39:06] of the week being monday
[39:08] done it twice in one sermon well he was
[39:13] and everybody laughs at me because i
[39:15] goof up
[39:17] you got your day you're coming to it
[39:21] so just hang on all right no problem
[39:24] we're just looking at it and saying
[39:26] okay let's get it let's get everything
[39:28] try you know to the right place
[39:30] all right now
[39:33] so then foreknowledge
[39:38] goes back and you remember we emphasized
[39:42] that part
[39:43] how far does foreknowledge go back
[39:46] as far as it can be as a matter of fact
[39:49] it can go back so far until it can come
[39:51] all the way back around
[39:52] and make the circle and connect together
[39:56] and go back to eternity
[39:59] right yes and see that way then we're
[40:01] not having to worry about it we're
[40:03] setting into the basis of understanding
[40:05] but by foreknowledge
[40:09] that way you will not predetermine
[40:11] something
[40:14] thereby then you'll you'll go with the
[40:16] prophet where he said
[40:17] god didn't desire anybody to be lost
[40:21] he wanted everybody to be saved
[40:24] all right but said they won't be why
[40:27] because they won't make the choice
[40:31] right so it's left up to me in you
[40:35] not god's problem
[40:38] now here was the lies we got to that the
[40:42] foreknowledge of god then goes back into
[40:44] the mind
[40:48] and i tried to emphasize this for 50
[40:52] years i've been on doing this
[40:57] god's mind in his mind he knows
[41:01] everything
[41:04] that would ever happen
[41:07] will happen has happened all of that
[41:11] god in his mind knows that
[41:14] well see then everybody is in god's mind
[41:17] i emphasize that a lot because see i've
[41:19] heard a lot of people say that
[41:21] why if i was in the mind of god i'll be
[41:23] there
[41:24] well that's no more than a presbyterian
[41:26] baptist
[41:27] predestination if i was preordained
[41:31] i'll be there if i wouldn't i won't
[41:35] well see that's no different to to do it
[41:37] that way all right
[41:39] but see being in his mind everybody's in
[41:41] his mind
[41:43] he thought of everybody okay
[41:46] thinking of everybody and what everybody
[41:48] would do then it's determined by that
[41:50] all right now this is the statement i've
[41:53] always made
[41:54] it may not you may not agree with it but
[41:57] i love it
[41:58] see then i don't want to be
[42:02] just a thought in god's mind
[42:05] amen that's right amen amen
[42:09] i want to be a part of the one that done
[42:12] the thinking amen that's right
[42:17] i want to be a part of the one that done
[42:19] if i'm part of god
[42:21] and i can only be part of god by the new
[42:24] birth
[42:25] to give me eternal life making me a
[42:29] child of god
[42:30] and by doing that then i become a part
[42:33] of god
[42:35] and being a part of god i'm a part of
[42:37] the one that's doing the thinking
[42:41] all right that's as simple as i can make
[42:44] it i've always tried to
[42:45] to simplify things and not confuse
[42:48] people
[42:49] see see then i want to be a part of
[42:52] god's mind
[42:53] because then i can read that that we
[42:55] read over and over
[42:57] chosen us in
[43:01] him amen all right
[43:05] then it's just not saying chosen us
[43:12] it's chosen us in him it's got to be in
[43:15] him
[43:16] doing the choosing part of it all right
[43:19] he chose us
[43:20] amen that's where we've been over and
[43:22] over god chose us
[43:24] we know that but see then we had to
[43:27] choose the fact of it
[43:28] of the point of accepting eternal life
[43:31] and choosing that to where we would
[43:33] choose to
[43:34] we had to accept him as our savior amen
[43:39] all right and see then that gets away
[43:42] because if i always was eternal what i
[43:45] need a savior for
[43:48] that's right
[43:51] see then you realize that what you're
[43:53] getting back to is you're getting back
[43:55] to the mind of god
[43:59] right before the foundation of the world
[44:03] and then you're not picking and choosing
[44:05] you're not trying to do those things
[44:06] you're trying to just be what he says
[44:08] about us
[44:12] he chose us
[44:15] see then we have to accept the choice
[44:19] we have to agree with his choice okay
[44:21] now
[44:22] listen to what i'm getting to the point
[44:24] now see that way
[44:25] i can think about the point not of
[44:28] something that it makes me some great
[44:31] something to think oh i was chosen
[44:35] before
[44:36] the world
[44:39] well god knew before the world judas
[44:40] says carrick would do what he'd done
[44:44] but you know what he had to let him come
[44:45] and do it
[44:48] the bible says jesus christ stood as a
[44:49] lamb slain before the foundation world
[44:51] but if he hadn't died two thousand years
[44:53] ago for our sins he would still be lost
[44:56] things has to come from a re to from a
[45:00] thought to a reality so that's what
[45:02] we're talking i'm going to be talking
[45:03] about
[45:04] see two creations
[45:11] one is a spiritual creation
[45:16] the other is a literal or or
[45:19] whatever words you want to use for a
[45:21] material
[45:23] uh thing that it's real
[45:28] all right so then that way we can keep
[45:31] it in a straight line
[45:33] and like i said then we won't be
[45:34] confused
[45:36] then we won't read christ a mystery well
[45:41] brother dale just don't understand god's
[45:43] first creation
[45:44] was angels
[45:49] well you know what that's right
[45:55] because that was the first part of the
[45:56] physical situation of coming to this way
[46:00] so i can you know see i can
[46:04] talk to you about like that because
[46:05] that's what i think
[46:08] but yet the first creation of god was
[46:12] god himself we'll read that in a minute
[46:14] and get started
[46:16] well god created god when did god create
[46:20] who is god what
[46:22] no it simply means
[46:25] just why i read revelation 3 14.
[46:29] the beginning of the creation of god
[46:35] did god create jesus and jesus created
[46:38] everything
[46:39] that's what your your trinity runs too
[46:42] no he's the author or beginner
[46:50] a coming forth in two what does a birth
[46:53] mean
[46:55] what does a birth mean a birth means a
[46:58] coming forth into
[47:00] the a baby is burst
[47:04] out of his mother's womb into reality
[47:07] into a world all right he's coming forth
[47:10] into okay amen
[47:14] and see that's what you do with the new
[47:15] birth
[47:17] the new birth is you're coming forth
[47:19] into
[47:21] amen right it's not something you say
[47:24] well this is the word that
[47:25] you don't get the idea when we read
[47:28] these things that
[47:29] the prophet is so massively confused i'm
[47:32] saying this ahead of time where you
[47:33] won't be confused when you get there
[47:36] you'd be surprised now i'm just as
[47:38] honest as it can be
[47:39] you'd be surprised how much you could do
[47:41] try it sometime
[47:44] talk to somebody and just say what was
[47:46] god's first creation
[47:47] but it was angels
[47:52] he said no no no yeah i got where the
[47:56] prophet said
[47:58] okay
[48:02] but if you got where he says other
[48:04] things too
[48:08] have you got to the genesis 1 26 man
[48:12] where god made man in his own image
[48:19] but get the point now let's start to the
[48:21] to what we're talking about
[48:24] see then for knowledge goes just as far
[48:27] backward as it does forward
[48:29] it's no problem because it's reality
[48:33] but it's in the mind of god
[48:38] all right and he can't change his mind
[48:42] about his word all right so we covered
[48:46] that where the king asked for time and
[48:48] god gave it to it
[48:49] did he change his mind no by his
[48:52] foreknowledge
[48:53] he knew all before the foundational
[48:55] world he was going to give that man 15
[48:57] years he knew that
[48:58] right so when he sent the prophet to him
[49:01] to tell him he's going to die
[49:03] that's right he wound up got better live
[49:07] 15 years
[49:08] but he died that's right
[49:11] that's sensible
[49:14] lisa it's right the word is right god
[49:17] don't change his mind
[49:21] but we look at things and think it looks
[49:23] like it's changed
[49:25] no god don't change his mind
[49:28] amen his thoughts are eternal
[49:32] all right now let's just
[49:35] get started on something to where we can
[49:37] today and then we'll
[49:39] can try to continue our thought
[49:42] go ahead with number one brothers and
[49:43] we'll now if we get
[49:46] any problems back there remember we're
[49:48] kind of
[49:50] sure you know anderson's the only one on
[49:52] the pole today
[49:53] so he's gonna have to be running this
[49:54] one going that's what's gonna
[49:56] and i ain't going back i tell him how to
[49:58] do it
[50:00] because i don't know how to do it okay
[50:03] but look what he says
[50:05] he's coming down from the book the
[50:06] message called job
[50:08] and all right let's go down now
[50:12] adam in the garden of eden
[50:15] when he first sinned amen now what
[50:18] god had a way of redemption for him
[50:24] right quick just as soon as he sinned
[50:29] god made a way of redemption
[50:32] amen amen
[50:35] now are you thinking about it
[50:39] god had a way of redemption for him
[50:43] you realize this may not mean unto you
[50:46] but it does to me in the point
[50:47] do you realize when adam and eve sinned
[50:51] do you realize one split second without
[50:53] an atonement
[50:55] or some way for that to be covered
[50:57] they'd have died right there
[50:59] sure that's right
[51:02] come on you tell me that's not true
[51:05] i'll stand here the rest of the day and
[51:07] tell you it is true
[51:09] if there was not something to cover
[51:14] the sin when adams and eve
[51:17] sinned they would have died immediately
[51:20] because sin cannot stand
[51:22] in the presence of god you agree
[51:25] i don't mean the message i'm preaching i
[51:27] just make a point
[51:30] that's just common sense all right
[51:34] see then there had to be something
[51:38] already in existence
[51:42] to cover that sin because watch what he
[51:45] said
[51:46] it's just just as soon as he sinned god
[51:48] made a way
[51:49] now he didn't listen he didn't see him
[51:52] run around through the garden and sing
[51:54] and do it and honoring three weeks later
[51:56] finally god caught up with him
[51:59] that's not the point the point is one
[52:01] thing
[52:02] before man sinned redemption
[52:08] was already in in view
[52:11] that's why the prophet said read it on
[52:12] that line god always had a plan
[52:15] of redemption and that's been through
[52:18] the blood
[52:19] once ever since the very beginning
[52:23] and dawn of time perceived in the mind
[52:26] of god
[52:27] before the world ever come into
[52:29] existence
[52:30] a plan of redemption amen i try to
[52:34] illustrate that for you to think
[52:36] as quick as adam and eve sinned
[52:40] had there not been something taken place
[52:44] they would have died because sin can't
[52:47] stand in the presence of god
[52:50] god already knew what he was going to do
[52:52] he already knew the prophet said
[52:54] that adam and eve would sin
[52:59] well why did he make them then because
[53:02] there was
[53:02] attributes and things that had to be
[53:05] brought into view
[53:08] all right see then their god was
[53:12] already made the atonement
[53:16] we look at the atonement as when he
[53:18] killed the animals
[53:20] and put the skin on
[53:24] we said well that was when he made the
[53:26] atonement he's
[53:28] already in his mind before the world
[53:29] ever begun jesus christ had done died
[53:33] in the mind of god before the world ever
[53:35] begun you agree that's what the bible
[53:37] says
[53:40] so then if he'd already died the
[53:42] atonement was already made
[53:46] that don't make you you think about some
[53:49] how wonderful our savior or god is
[53:52] that he never waited till we went out
[53:54] and done all these wrongs
[53:55] and then finally one day he said well i
[53:57] better get down there and do something
[53:59] about this
[54:01] that won't work one split
[54:05] second in the presence of god sin would
[54:08] cause that person to
[54:10] be annihilated amen
[54:14] but see god in his mind
[54:18] had done made the plan amen
[54:22] god in his mind knew exactly what he
[54:25] would do
[54:27] he made a plan
[54:31] he made the plan all he was doing was
[54:34] waiting on
[54:35] us to make the mistakes
[54:38] right right he'd made the plan
[54:42] and had to plan god always
[54:47] notice god always had a plan
[54:51] of redemption
[54:54] so before we ever sin god already had
[54:57] the plan made
[54:58] amen amen
[55:02] he knew we would sin so he'd already
[55:05] planned it before the foundation was
[55:07] that's why the bible said that he stood
[55:09] as a lamb slain
[55:10] before the foundation of the world amen
[55:15] and that was in his mind it was not a
[55:18] physical reality of the crucifixion
[55:22] that was done like 2 000 years ago
[55:28] right there in jerusalem when he paid
[55:31] the price
[55:32] right but what if he had never paid the
[55:34] price physically
[55:36] amen
[55:40] what would we know what and the mind of
[55:42] god i've always was
[55:45] you can't tell me i know it you can't
[55:47] tell people
[55:48] you forget it you can't tell people you
[55:50] can talk all day long
[55:52] it used to be one brother he'd he'd come
[55:54] up question me about something
[55:56] and i spent hours trying to express it
[55:59] to him and
[56:00] talk to him you know and showing him the
[56:01] prophet and
[56:03] when he gets through you know what he
[56:04] said well why'd he say it
[56:08] it was always about something brother
[56:10] branham is saying and he said
[56:12] well why'd he say it
[56:15] well there's no way to express anything
[56:17] to him so you just finally
[56:19] get to the point that you just say
[56:21] forget it all right
[56:23] but now listen god's always
[56:28] so what in his mind
[56:32] in his foreknowledge
[56:38] he already paid the price
[56:43] so adam and eve was covered by the blood
[56:49] then physically finally it came into
[56:52] reality
[56:55] that he paid the price with the blood
[56:56] that come into reality
[56:58] it had to because if not it would have
[57:00] just been in the mind
[57:05] same thing with calvary it finally come
[57:07] into reality
[57:10] that god would come down in human flesh
[57:13] and live and give his life for you and i
[57:17] you know that's not it just in his mind
[57:21] you you want to get everything in his
[57:22] mind i want things into reality because
[57:25] i want it to be
[57:26] something to work that i believe my
[57:29] religion has a tangibility
[57:33] that's just the way i believe it now i
[57:35] believe my salvation is real
[57:39] it's eternal it's real all right
[57:42] and that way then i don't have to worry
[57:44] about it to see whether it'll work or
[57:46] not
[57:48] because it already worked
[57:51] he stood as a lamb slain before the
[57:53] foundation of the world
[57:55] and there's where the choosing was at
[57:57] now got this with the prophet
[57:58] there's where your choosing came into
[58:00] being
[58:03] your choosing came into being when
[58:08] he in his mind saw what he was going to
[58:10] do
[58:14] and he chose us
[58:18] in him well this is why i love
[58:22] about it if he was chosen
[58:25] i don't have to worry about it that's
[58:27] right
[58:28] i know he was
[58:32] i know he was chosen don't you amen
[58:35] but the main thing is to know whether or
[58:38] not
[58:40] that i know whether i'm chosen or not
[58:46] well i believe it was you can't tell me
[58:48] i wasn't saved
[58:50] why are you arguing about it ain't
[58:53] nobody trying to convince you neither
[58:54] way i mean
[58:56] but just remember it's got to be brought
[58:59] into reality
[59:02] see something real all right now think
[59:04] about it
[59:07] god in his mind
[59:11] he could look backwards forward
[59:14] doesn't make no difference because he
[59:17] could he was
[59:18] the infinite he was the eternal
[59:22] all right it was in his mind were we
[59:25] were we spirits then they asked the
[59:27] prophet he said
[59:29] no he said we were nothing he said was
[59:32] just in his mind
[59:33] all right he said figuratively which to
[59:36] me
[59:37] means figuratively means he's expressing
[59:40] it to the basis that
[59:41] it's coming from a spiritual to a
[59:44] natural
[59:46] it has to be in a movement form to word
[59:48] that it comes into reality
[59:50] and that's what we want it's a reality
[59:53] all right
[59:54] that's why i said now all right so which
[59:56] comes first now
[1:00:00] did the spiritual creation come first
[1:00:03] or did the literal creation come first
[1:00:09] then well i don't know well i'm just
[1:00:12] asking you a simple question that's why
[1:00:15] i love the message
[1:00:16] the message has the answer
[1:00:20] it may be confusing to us in mass
[1:00:22] understanding i guess
[1:00:24] but still it's true okay go ahead to
[1:00:28] number two and let's see
[1:00:31] this is taken from christ as a mystery
[1:00:33] god reveal
[1:00:35] and look what he says now god's secret
[1:00:41] here i go again i've
[1:00:44] read enough to understand on christ the
[1:00:48] mystery
[1:00:49] brother branham covers the coming of the
[1:00:53] lord the seventh seal the thunders
[1:00:57] all in christ's mystery
[1:01:00] now this is why i love it because he's
[1:01:03] he didn't say
[1:01:04] if you don't understand the seals go
[1:01:06] back to the seals
[1:01:08] or go back to daniel 70 weeks or go back
[1:01:10] to this
[1:01:11] he said if you don't understand to see
[1:01:12] if go back to christ in history
[1:01:16] because it's a complete plan of
[1:01:19] redemption
[1:01:20] amen all right the seals
[1:01:25] the seals the complete plan of
[1:01:27] redemption
[1:01:28] right okay
[1:01:32] it's the simple point of understanding
[1:01:36] salvation
[1:01:38] and what it's about so look what he says
[1:01:43] he had before the god secret mystery
[1:01:46] he had before the world begun back in
[1:01:48] the back part
[1:01:50] of god's mind now that's really going
[1:01:52] back there in it
[1:01:53] front part is what you think with that's
[1:01:55] why the bible says that you can have the
[1:01:57] mark of the beast
[1:01:59] in your forehead not something stamped
[1:02:02] up there
[1:02:04] not 666 wrote out no that's not it it's
[1:02:07] in your thinking
[1:02:08] it's your eye your conception and your
[1:02:11] thinking
[1:02:12] is in the front part of your brain
[1:02:15] all right science tells you that go read
[1:02:17] a little bit
[1:02:18] see then it can go back to where you're
[1:02:20] going into the
[1:02:22] points of goes back into the back part
[1:02:26] in other words you're going back as far
[1:02:27] as you can go
[1:02:29] so that's what he's saying before the
[1:02:32] foundation world back in the back part
[1:02:34] of god's mind
[1:02:36] there was something he was trying and
[1:02:38] was going to achieve
[1:02:41] now listen so is that true what it said
[1:02:43] he already had a plan of redemption
[1:02:46] it already was there look what he says
[1:02:50] he had a motive in doing it
[1:02:54] what was his motive in order to
[1:02:57] let himself be expressed
[1:03:02] because first there wasn't even a moon
[1:03:05] star atom molecule or anything
[1:03:08] he was god now listen to the
[1:03:10] terminologies and don't get confused
[1:03:14] see he said he was god before the
[1:03:16] foundational world
[1:03:18] he was god now watch him but he exactly
[1:03:21] wasn't god at that time
[1:03:24] now see don't get confused about the
[1:03:27] point
[1:03:28] just listen to what he's saying because
[1:03:31] god is an object of worship
[1:03:33] see there was nothing back here to
[1:03:34] worship him so you didn't call him god
[1:03:38] you said well what'd you call him the
[1:03:39] best thing you can come up with is
[1:03:40] self-existing
[1:03:42] that's the best terminology they can
[1:03:44] elohim or el
[1:03:46] ella elohim you ever noticed brother
[1:03:49] runner would always put those together
[1:03:51] l ella elohim he'll always lay him into
[1:03:54] order
[1:03:55] to coming out to the word self-existing
[1:03:59] all right so there was a time god dwelt
[1:04:01] alone
[1:04:05] he was self-existing all right
[1:04:09] now if that's true then there was
[1:04:12] nothing back there with him so where's
[1:04:13] the trinity come from
[1:04:15] how many gods you got
[1:04:19] i mean if it's true that he's
[1:04:21] self-existing
[1:04:22] then it's not just one i don't care
[1:04:26] what your concept or thoughts is there's
[1:04:27] just one
[1:04:29] because there's no way to put two or
[1:04:30] three in self-existence
[1:04:34] who existed before who existed and who
[1:04:36] created who
[1:04:40] no just listen
[1:04:43] because god is an object to western and
[1:04:45] there wasn't nothing to worship him
[1:04:47] so in his great mind amen now
[1:04:52] the back part
[1:04:57] he wanted these attributes to be
[1:04:59] expressed
[1:05:05] in him was love in him was to be father
[1:05:08] now watch that we don't get it today
[1:05:11] watch
[1:05:11] that point
[1:05:17] in him was to be son and him was to be a
[1:05:21] savior
[1:05:22] and him was to be a healer and all these
[1:05:25] great attributes that we see already
[1:05:27] expressed
[1:05:28] they were in god before the world
[1:05:34] were there at in his mind amen
[1:05:37] in his thoughts that's right
[1:05:40] his concept or whatever you want to call
[1:05:42] it he already knew exactly
[1:05:45] how everything was going to turn out
[1:05:50] satan didn't pull nothing over on god in
[1:05:52] the garden
[1:05:53] satan just helped him work out his plan
[1:05:59] but now this is right if i don't get to
[1:06:00] it i'll get back to it
[1:06:02] sunday you need to consider one thing
[1:06:08] there's a lot more to our thoughts of
[1:06:10] the word father
[1:06:13] than to just
[1:06:19] now we're going to read where the
[1:06:20] prophet said that in adam and eve he
[1:06:22] could be father
[1:06:27] he could be god
[1:06:30] by creating angels
[1:06:38] see we want to make you say well what
[1:06:40] are the attributes
[1:06:41] healer saga there was a lot of
[1:06:43] attributes that could be displayed
[1:06:47] you realize he could have been a father
[1:06:49] of adam and eve he was
[1:06:51] because he created them and you know
[1:06:53] that was before sin entered the picture
[1:06:56] sin didn't make him a father
[1:07:02] see we get all of these thoughts in our
[1:07:04] mind and
[1:07:06] we try to instead of listening and
[1:07:12] thinking
[1:07:14] considering what the prophet is saying
[1:07:16] and then one of these days you'll
[1:07:18] realize
[1:07:19] god did send a prophet amen
[1:07:23] [Applause]
[1:07:24] realize that that's a wonderful thing to
[1:07:27] think of what are you doing
[1:07:31] because you're going to get in a minute
[1:07:32] where i'm going to read to you where
[1:07:34] brother runs says the first creation was
[1:07:36] god himself
[1:07:37] now finds you a theologian to figure
[1:07:39] that out for you
[1:07:42] find me a doctor of divinity
[1:07:46] and let's see if he can talk on those
[1:07:47] terms
[1:07:49] but a simple little prophet could talk
[1:07:51] it's just just like he's saying there
[1:07:54] there was a time that he wasn't god well
[1:07:57] what do you mean he's been god the whole
[1:07:59] time
[1:08:00] you're not listening right
[1:08:04] god is an object of worship there had to
[1:08:06] be something come to worship him
[1:08:08] that's what brought his attribute into
[1:08:10] display
[1:08:12] sure he always was god he always wasn't
[1:08:15] self-existent
[1:08:16] he always was jesus he always was that
[1:08:18] was his name
[1:08:19] always been his name all of those things
[1:08:24] let's see to think about it but see we
[1:08:27] talk about
[1:08:29] we say well what was the attributes
[1:08:30] savior healer etc
[1:08:32] we don't even think about father
[1:08:35] father was his first attribute
[1:08:39] he did not he did not have to let sin
[1:08:43] enter the picture to be a father amen
[1:08:47] he did not have to let sin under the
[1:08:50] picture to be god amen
[1:08:53] right
[1:08:57] so we're backing up further than just i
[1:09:00] hope you're listening
[1:09:01] because see most of what i've been
[1:09:03] trying to do to back you up to work
[1:09:04] that you'll think about foreknowledge
[1:09:07] but now see we're back in past four
[1:09:09] knowledge
[1:09:12] well maybe i shouldn't say that one
[1:09:16] but you think about it
[1:09:20] we've already taken one step back past
[1:09:22] four knowledge
[1:09:23] if you're listening adam and eve
[1:09:27] made him father
[1:09:34] he didn't sin didn't make him father sin
[1:09:37] made him a savior
[1:09:39] sin made him a healer you know et cetera
[1:09:41] et cetera okay now listen
[1:09:43] they were in so my opinion now look at
[1:09:45] him
[1:09:47] so my opinion the first thing that he
[1:09:49] made
[1:09:50] was angels well see we got
[1:09:53] first thing he made now
[1:09:57] all right
[1:10:00] natural and spiritual
[1:10:05] angels are not uh
[1:10:10] fleshly beings we know that we realize
[1:10:12] that part they're not
[1:10:14] tangible fleshly beings but they're
[1:10:16] closer than
[1:10:18] just a spiritual part right because
[1:10:21] they're closer into reality
[1:10:24] so he's just explaining it first he made
[1:10:26] angels
[1:10:28] and they worshipped him now he's god in
[1:10:30] another message you'll see
[1:10:32] that he'll say he created in his image
[1:10:37] and bring forth that's what i'm trying
[1:10:41] to get you to keep from being confused
[1:10:43] and maybe finally i'm sorry i'm as
[1:10:45] honest as i can be about it
[1:10:47] sometimes i think i do confuse people by
[1:10:49] trying to make it so simple
[1:10:58] make it so simple until i'm just going
[1:11:00] to play like this
[1:11:01] until really when the prophet explains
[1:11:03] something they ain't no other way of
[1:11:05] explaining it
[1:11:07] amen my ideas and your ideas ain't no
[1:11:11] good on trying to explain something when
[1:11:13] your prophet is the one that's bringing
[1:11:15] to the view
[1:11:16] right we can have our concepts and
[1:11:18] thoughts but be careful
[1:11:20] right just don't let them run aground
[1:11:24] right
[1:11:26] what did he say so my opinion the first
[1:11:29] thing he made was angels and then they
[1:11:30] worshipped him and that made him god
[1:11:32] and he started from there as in previous
[1:11:36] messages
[1:11:37] i've tried to explain it break it down
[1:11:40] and now
[1:11:40] then when angels begin to worship him
[1:11:43] that was before there was
[1:11:44] even a molecule in the earth
[1:11:49] there was nothing it was all darkness
[1:11:51] there wasn't no sun there was no moon
[1:11:53] there was no star no nothing
[1:11:55] then he was god as he asked job where
[1:11:59] was you when i laid the foundation of
[1:12:01] the world
[1:12:02] see when the morning stars sang together
[1:12:05] the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:12:08] where were you it was way back
[1:12:11] before the earth because listen
[1:12:17] in god's great mind
[1:12:20] he had a purpose he had a hidden mystery
[1:12:26] now he had a purpose
[1:12:30] in other words to let himself be
[1:12:31] expressed
[1:12:34] he didn't just want children running all
[1:12:36] over the place and them to have nothing
[1:12:38] to understand
[1:12:43] he wanted to express himself

[1:14:20] wanted it to come into reality

[1:15:31] something real
[1:15:33] you're not just some concept or
[1:15:35] somebody's idea this is not this brother
[1:15:37] branham stouts
[1:15:39] amen come on brother that's right i hope
[1:15:41] you're understanding that
[1:15:44] amen if he was a prophet it's the
[1:15:46] thoughts of god to come forth amen
[1:15:52] us to understand because we never
[1:15:54] understood it
[1:15:58] come on church i mean i sat back there
[1:16:00] in the baptist church and i always did
[1:16:02] study the bible i always read and
[1:16:03] studied it
[1:16:06] and i believed it but i always had that
[1:16:10] wondering how did i get here
[1:16:13] what am i doing here i met god when i
[1:16:15] was 11 years old you couldn't tell me
[1:16:16] there was no god
[1:16:17] forget it but see i didn't know how to
[1:16:21] get to that god
[1:16:23] and i kept my travels through time
[1:16:26] traveling up going to church and doing
[1:16:28] and listening
[1:16:29] but see one day i heard a prophet
[1:16:32] he started talking about god in a way
[1:16:38] that nobody had ever talked like that no
[1:16:41] man spake like this man
[1:16:45] and he started talking about it and i
[1:16:47] started looking
[1:16:50] i said well lord i found somebody that
[1:16:54] knows what happened
[1:16:56] when i was 11 years old
[1:17:00] because i saw him
[1:17:04] but to try to explain it you can't
[1:17:06] explain it because you try to explain it
[1:17:08] to people oh you're who you think you
[1:17:09] are you think you're prophesied
[1:17:11] no i'll just stay like it is it happened
[1:17:13] that's right
[1:17:14] you you know you you do it all right but
[1:17:17] now listen
[1:17:19] his thoughts there was nothing with him
[1:17:24] but just his thoughts
[1:17:28] back before the world self-existing
[1:17:33] just god alone but he had thoughts
[1:17:38] now we've gone down into it maybe in a
[1:17:40] little further you know what he was
[1:17:42] lonely
[1:17:45] you know when he created man he made
[1:17:47] adam in the garden you know when adam
[1:17:49] was by himself
[1:17:50] you know he knew exactly how adam fell
[1:17:53] he knew adam was lonely because he'd
[1:17:56] been lonely
[1:17:57] he wanted somebody to fellowship with
[1:18:02] but he couldn't fellowship with the
[1:18:03] devil's children so let's don't get over
[1:18:05] into those former
[1:18:06] thoughts or whatever you know oh bless
[1:18:08] god i always was eternal
[1:18:10] i don't need salvation well if you don't
[1:18:12] need it you ain't gonna get it
[1:18:14] is there any plainer than that if you
[1:18:16] don't need it you ain't gonna get it
[1:18:17] cause you ain't gonna search for it
[1:18:19] all right let's see if you want it
[1:18:23] it's there for you amen
[1:18:26] thoughts god had a purpose
[1:18:30] and a hidden mystery he wanted to
[1:18:34] display himself
[1:18:36] to his offspring
[1:18:41] now he didn't come to save the devil's
[1:18:42] children no
[1:18:46] but you can't discount the devil's
[1:18:48] children and say they're nothing and you
[1:18:50] know
[1:18:50] everybody oh that's a serpent seed over
[1:18:52] you ever really run into them
[1:18:54] you know oh that brother there he's
[1:18:55] serpent seed he don't believe like i
[1:18:57] believe he's serpent seed
[1:19:00] yeah like i've always told you i don't
[1:19:03] mind saying that
[1:19:04] i don't care if you run my genealogy all
[1:19:06] the way back
[1:19:07] and put me standing right there as a
[1:19:10] direct descendant from cain
[1:19:12] that don't bother me none whatsoever
[1:19:15] because it's a spiritual happening first
[1:19:18] that's a physical happening right amen
[1:19:22] okay his thoughts
[1:19:25] but he gets in his mind what he's going
[1:19:28] to do
[1:19:32] what about god
[1:19:37] sitting down with his thoughts
[1:19:40] thinking things over
[1:19:44] now come on listen he says i can go this
[1:19:48] way
[1:19:49] but if i go that way then
[1:19:52] that would be me picking and choosing
[1:19:56] and i can't do that if i go this way i
[1:20:00] can do
[1:20:01] see no i can't do that
[1:20:06] his thoughts is not that he sat down
[1:20:08] like me and you
[1:20:09] and thought about it and tomorrow he
[1:20:11] thought about something better next day
[1:20:12] he thought about something better and
[1:20:13] next day he thought about something
[1:20:14] better
[1:20:15] we finally get around to doing what we
[1:20:17] got together he didn't do that
[1:20:19] his thoughts is eternal
[1:20:22] he said my thoughts are not your
[1:20:24] thoughts my ways are not your ways
[1:20:27] his thoughts were eternal so what he
[1:20:29] thought of right that's why we can say
[1:20:32] tonight if we i mean today if we have
[1:20:34] the baptism of the holy ghost we have
[1:20:36] eternal life
[1:20:38] amen the life that was in god now dwells
[1:20:41] in his people
[1:20:46] we're an offspring of god amen
[1:20:51] thoughts of his mind
[1:20:57] he knew exactly what it would take to
[1:21:00] contact you brother
[1:21:04] see i can talk to people when i know
[1:21:06] that they're coming towards salvation
[1:21:07] because i can remember what i did
[1:21:09] because see i sought god
[1:21:10] oh i done everything i sought god
[1:21:12] especially after meeting him back there
[1:21:14] when i got into 18 years of age and
[1:21:17] things like that
[1:21:17] i've told you about it and you don't
[1:21:19] agree with it i'm sure you think i'm
[1:21:20] crazy
[1:21:21] but i'd go out in the world of sin and
[1:21:22] do wrong and come back home and just
[1:21:24] feel dirty this
[1:21:26] lord i don't
[1:21:32] because i knew there was something
[1:21:34] somewhere that was a whole lot more
[1:21:36] powerful than i was
[1:21:39] someone was a whole lot greater than i
[1:21:40] was all i wanted was somebody to take my
[1:21:44] hand what did brother run said about job
[1:21:46] said he wanted somebody to be able to
[1:21:47] take his hand and take him to god
[1:21:50] that's all i wanted i used to talk to
[1:21:52] them old deacons and things in the
[1:21:54] church there and i was 23 years old as a
[1:21:57] deacon
[1:21:58] and i remember sitting there one day and
[1:22:00] they were talking about you know this
[1:22:01] and
[1:22:02] i said well you know they're saying
[1:22:04] deacons because in the baptist church
[1:22:05] now you might not think this is true but
[1:22:07] go ahead check with somebody
[1:22:08] the baptist church the deacons run the
[1:22:10] show
[1:22:12] and we had the full authority to run the
[1:22:14] show because that's what we was
[1:22:17] and we decided what to do it didn't
[1:22:19] matter what the preacher decided
[1:22:21] he was voted out the door
[1:22:25] if he didn't like what we'd done he went
[1:22:27] out the door
[1:22:28] i was there sitting with them
[1:22:31] and they was explaining that to us one
[1:22:33] day
[1:22:35] that the deacons this is an explanation
[1:22:37] the deacons
[1:22:38] in other words donny there's the pastor
[1:22:41] the preacher you know
[1:22:42] and he gets off the baptist doctrine see
[1:22:45] we get together
[1:22:46] he's off the doctrine okay let's go and
[1:22:49] we go to him and we say uh you're off
[1:22:52] the doctrine
[1:22:54] so you leave or straighten up your
[1:22:56] doctrine
[1:22:58] you know get this right he had a choice
[1:23:01] of straightening it up
[1:23:04] but if he didn't he went out the door
[1:23:07] because we were the deacons you know
[1:23:09] what i told him one day
[1:23:11] i know i'm sarcastic i know
[1:23:14] sometimes i love it and sometimes i hate
[1:23:16] it but it's all right
[1:23:18] i told him one day i said you know what
[1:23:19] i've been reading the bible a long time
[1:23:21] and i said the only thing i found in the
[1:23:23] bible that the deacon was supposed to do
[1:23:24] was wait on tables
[1:23:28] is that true in the book of acts come on
[1:23:32] go he's taking care of the widows and
[1:23:35] orphans and everything
[1:23:37] you had a little little but you really
[1:23:39] were just waiting on table
[1:23:41] well of course they didn't like that but
[1:23:43] that's all right
[1:23:46] but you see church i've always wanted to
[1:23:49] see god know him in reality
[1:23:55] and when this prophet started talking
[1:23:56] about him i knew right there
[1:23:59] i knew another thing that i've explained
[1:24:01] to you over and over
[1:24:04] as a deacon at 23 years of age joined
[1:24:08] the church when i was about 18.
[1:24:11] foster went through my salvation you
[1:24:12] know that thing
[1:24:14] repentance and to do it you know what
[1:24:18] when i heard this prophet talking about
[1:24:19] god
[1:24:20] i knew immediately i did not have the
[1:24:23] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:24:24] he was talking about nobody explained
[1:24:28] that to me
[1:24:28] nobody took me aside and showed me where
[1:24:31] i knew right there that i didn't have
[1:24:35] what he's talking about
[1:24:38] i didn't get all upset and all
[1:24:40] frustrated
[1:24:42] i just said well lord there's only one
[1:24:44] thing to do
[1:24:45] i'll just start searching for you
[1:24:49] somewhere down the road you'll meet me
[1:24:52] well he did
[1:24:53] yes i come into this message
[1:24:57] and all in two years in the message
[1:25:00] before i ever
[1:25:01] claimed the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:25:04] brother motor he'd say brother dale i
[1:25:06] know there's something he said but
[1:25:08] i know you're not one of these that's
[1:25:10] trying to find tongues or this that or
[1:25:12] the other but said there's some reason
[1:25:13] that you can't get this right
[1:25:15] i said you're exactly right i don't know
[1:25:16] what the reason is
[1:25:18] he said well the thing i suggest you do
[1:25:20] is one time
[1:25:22] he said you stop trying to figure out
[1:25:24] anything and accept what the word says
[1:25:26] that's right amen
[1:25:30] that you just read the word and accept
[1:25:32] what it says
[1:25:34] and i walked right into the baptism with
[1:25:36] the holy ghost
[1:25:37] my wife received at the same time right
[1:25:39] side by side
[1:25:42] amen two years everybody tell me well
[1:25:45] you've got the holy ghost you come into
[1:25:47] the message
[1:25:49] and that's what most people think i come
[1:25:51] into the message i got the holy ghost i
[1:25:52] know i got the holy ghost because i come
[1:25:54] into the message
[1:25:55] will you are you going to tell me that
[1:25:56] judas wasn't in the message
[1:25:58] that's right now don't talk to me about
[1:26:02] things satan
[1:26:04] that don't work but listen
[1:26:07] god dwelt alone with his thoughts
[1:26:10] but he knew in his thoughts what he
[1:26:12] wanted to do are you listening
[1:26:16] in his mind what he's going to do
[1:26:25] he knew exactly what it would take to
[1:26:28] contact
[1:26:29] each one of us
[1:26:33] he knew exactly how to contact you
[1:26:39] you may have sought god right okay
[1:26:41] that's fine but just remember he's
[1:26:43] seeking you
[1:26:44] the goodness of god the bible said lead
[1:26:46] us us to repentance okay
[1:26:52] listen but he gets in his mind
[1:26:55] what he's going to do and that's his
[1:26:58] thoughts
[1:26:59] listen that's his desires
[1:27:03] now watch it now it's a thought
[1:27:08] and then he speaks it and it's a word
[1:27:12] then
[1:27:13] the word a thought when it's expressed
[1:27:15] is a word
[1:27:16] a thought expressed is a word but it has
[1:27:18] to be a
[1:27:19] thought first so it's god's attributes
[1:27:23] then it becomes a thought
[1:27:27] and then a word amen
[1:27:31] you thinking satan pulled anything over
[1:27:33] on god
[1:27:34] no he helped him amen he helped him
[1:27:40] doing his plan okay listen
[1:27:44] he gets in his mind
[1:27:47] let's see i know i ain't going to be
[1:27:50] able to get very far but
[1:27:53] because i want one thought to get to you
[1:27:59] spiritual creation comes before physical
[1:28:02] i'll do this then i'll back up on these
[1:28:04] notes sunday and bring it back
[1:28:08] we don't have a physical creation than a
[1:28:10] spiritual one that's not that's
[1:28:12] incorrect you've got to have a spiritual
[1:28:14] creation and then a physical creation
[1:28:16] right all right
[1:28:20] and then as we do let's think of
[1:28:22] something
[1:28:24] how great a prophet could express
[1:28:26] something go to number nine brother i'm
[1:28:27] sorry
[1:28:28] it'll take you a minute to pick it up go
[1:28:30] up to number nine
[1:28:32] which is questions and answers on
[1:28:34] genesis
[1:28:36] all right if god created man in his own
[1:28:40] image
[1:28:42] in his own likeness what kind of a man
[1:28:44] did he create
[1:28:45] we know this we've read it right a
[1:28:48] spirit man that's genesis 1 26 and 27
[1:28:51] let us make man in our image and our
[1:28:53] likeness and let them have dominion et
[1:28:55] cetera
[1:28:56] a spiritual man a theophany for
[1:28:59] words which is a body and thing
[1:29:03] now listen a spirit man now if you'll
[1:29:05] notice
[1:29:06] after he had made all the creation
[1:29:09] what i said you you get confused but you
[1:29:12] back up and listen
[1:29:14] after he had made all the creation and
[1:29:17] created a spirit man
[1:29:19] the close reading of this now for the
[1:29:21] question the brother had asked
[1:29:23] you give him dominion of the cattle now
[1:29:26] see you look up here and you look at it
[1:29:27] read
[1:29:28] it made all the creation
[1:29:32] you're following genesis correct natural
[1:29:35] creation
[1:29:36] you create a world he created a test he
[1:29:39] created that he finally come down
[1:29:41] created
[1:29:42] animals and things like that and then it
[1:29:45] looks like he flops over and creates
[1:29:48] but find me a day that he created man
[1:29:53] he said well there's the sabbath okay
[1:29:55] we're going along with you
[1:29:57] but the scripture don't say that it's
[1:29:59] the sixth day
[1:30:03] the sixth day was the creation of man
[1:30:08] see because genesis 1 26 and 27 is not a
[1:30:11] natural man
[1:30:12] that's a spiritual man natural man was
[1:30:14] created in genesis 2
[1:30:17] right genesis 2 read your bible he
[1:30:19] created a natural man
[1:30:21] a physical man an atom then he took a
[1:30:24] rib and created eve
[1:30:25] that's genesis 2.
[1:30:29] so what come first did he create the
[1:30:31] world first now he created
[1:30:35] angels for one time he created many
[1:30:38] things
[1:30:40] but the one thing is listen to what he
[1:30:41] says
[1:30:46] god give dominion to the cattle and the
[1:30:48] fishes and everything to the man
[1:30:50] not the physical man the spirit man
[1:30:55] but in his making up there he made a man
[1:30:57] in his own image
[1:30:58] to lead the cattle lead the beast to
[1:31:00] feel just like the holy spirit
[1:31:02] leads the believer today see he was in
[1:31:05] other words
[1:31:06] adam the first man
[1:31:11] in the lower creation
[1:31:14] of god physical man
[1:31:18] but he made him a spirit man first amen
[1:31:20] right
[1:31:22] listen the first creation was god
[1:31:25] himself
[1:31:29] man that's i'd like for a theologian to
[1:31:31] explain that one
[1:31:35] thing then out of god came to logos
[1:31:39] which was the son of god
[1:31:40] amen out of the logos which was the word
[1:31:44] in the beginning was the word and words
[1:31:45] with god and the word was god and the
[1:31:46] word was made flesh
[1:31:48] and dwelt among us out of the logos came
[1:31:50] forth to man
[1:31:53] amen but think about what he's saying
[1:31:56] god's first creation was himself
[1:32:02] now i got the quotes here where brother
[1:32:04] brown said that people think that god
[1:32:05] created jesus and jesus created
[1:32:07] everything else
[1:32:08] he said that's incorrect he said that
[1:32:09] would be god creating god
[1:32:11] he said that's not true okay we'll read
[1:32:14] to that later
[1:32:15] but think about it what does it mean
[1:32:18] of god's first creation
[1:32:24] with himself
[1:32:31] was he non-existent
[1:32:34] come into existence
[1:32:41] did he none exist and he created himself
[1:32:44] no that's why it says that in genesis i
[1:32:48] mean in revelation
[1:32:50] to this day what is it revelation 3 14
[1:32:54] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:32:57] that's right
[1:32:58] not that god created god that's
[1:33:00] incorrect that's no thoughts
[1:33:05] but the fact that he stepped forth
[1:33:10] now there's a quote in here we'll get to
[1:33:11] in a minute where he says
[1:33:13] out of the logos came the son
[1:33:16] he said he gave birth to his son
[1:33:22] well go back then and think about it
[1:33:25] here's god in the beginning
[1:33:28] self-existing
[1:33:29] nothing existing with him totally
[1:33:35] all self-existing and then all at once
[1:33:39] something happens
[1:33:42] not another person gets involved
[1:33:49] but he does what he said he wanted to do
[1:33:51] he wanted to express
[1:33:52] himself so his children could understand
[1:33:54] him so what did he do he just
[1:33:56] condescended
[1:33:59] amen is that simple yeah
[1:34:04] now not that he left god and went down
[1:34:06] to god
[1:34:07] another no no don't get all that
[1:34:08] involved and you're thinking just think
[1:34:10] about what i'm saying and listen
[1:34:15] he was in existence all alone
[1:34:21] and he knew that he couldn't be
[1:34:23] comprehended like that
[1:34:26] he knew we couldn't do that that's the
[1:34:28] words of the prophet he said
[1:34:30] the eternal god can't be comprehended by
[1:34:32] the natural mind
[1:34:34] so what did he do he just condescended
[1:34:39] descended if you want to use the word
[1:34:41] just be careful too much descendant but
[1:34:44] he just stepped forth into another form
[1:34:50] which was the word his thoughts had been
[1:34:54] spoken
[1:34:55] let there be they were material to him
[1:35:02] but there was his
[1:35:06] coming down his condescended he just
[1:35:08] stepped down into another form
[1:35:10] and became the word amen
[1:35:13] now we're in john 1. in the beginning
[1:35:16] was the word the word is with god and
[1:35:18] the word was god
[1:35:19] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:35:21] among us that goes in from
[1:35:22] jesus into a natural creation right
[1:35:26] he goes from a spiritual creation man to
[1:35:28] a natural physical creation
[1:35:30] as to him and well that's exactly what
[1:35:32] god is doing here
[1:35:34] he's just condescending
[1:35:38] he's just stepping down condescending
[1:35:41] toward humanity and there's no humanity
[1:35:44] there because they ain't even molecule
[1:35:45] ain't nothing
[1:35:48] in his mind he knows exactly what he's
[1:35:51] doing
[1:35:52] and he just takes another step
[1:35:56] carnal i know but he's the spirit man
[1:35:59] which is first
[1:36:02] which is first spirit man
[1:36:06] spirit man begins to condescend towards
[1:36:11] a natural reality
[1:36:16] okay as he begins to descend
[1:36:21] he just takes another step and he goes
[1:36:24] into another form
[1:36:27] is that colossians who in the form of
[1:36:30] god thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:36:32] with god
[1:36:33] but took upon himself the form of an of
[1:36:36] humanity he just changed his form
[1:36:40] that's what he did he he didn't have to
[1:36:43] jump down condescend
[1:36:45] no he just started moving our way
[1:36:49] we ain't getting started we ain't even
[1:36:52] come into being yet right
[1:36:54] he starts moving
[1:36:57] and as he does in his mind
[1:37:01] he just looks and he says if i make man
[1:37:04] this away
[1:37:06] he'll fall if i make him predetermined
[1:37:13] then there's no way for him to fall but
[1:37:15] i can't bring forth my attributes
[1:37:18] he's got attributes his savior healer no
[1:37:22] but don't forget the one thing called we
[1:37:25] ought to back up to it
[1:37:26] don't forget one thing when adam and eve
[1:37:29] come into existence
[1:37:31] he didn't have to do anything he was a
[1:37:33] father
[1:37:36] that was his family he was a father
[1:37:40] right there
[1:37:42] he didn't have to let sin enter the
[1:37:44] picture to be a father
[1:37:47] he was a father as quick as adam and eve
[1:37:48] come into existence in his mind
[1:37:51] he knew that what he would have to do
[1:37:54] right now listen he knew in the garden
[1:37:58] that if they'd sin he would have to make
[1:38:00] up a situation right
[1:38:02] through his blood that's right he knew
[1:38:05] he was going to have to do that
[1:38:07] he never come into this haphazardly not
[1:38:10] knowing or
[1:38:11] under no he knew exactly what he was
[1:38:12] going to do and that's what i said
[1:38:14] then when sin entered the picture it
[1:38:17] already was covered
[1:38:19] adam and eve was already covered by the
[1:38:21] blood atonement that was not
[1:38:23] physical but spiritual amen
[1:38:29] his first creation was himself he just
[1:38:30] stepped forth into
[1:38:34] now what did he do with us he just
[1:38:35] started creating not creating like
[1:38:37] making something out of something that
[1:38:39] didn't exist
[1:38:41] he just started bringing us forth that's
[1:38:44] right
[1:38:45] that's what he's still doing he's still
[1:38:47] bringing us forth
[1:38:50] going from a spiritual creation
[1:38:56] to a natural or in other words into
[1:38:59] reality
[1:39:01] spiritual
[1:39:04] he could make man in his own image
[1:39:08] come on he made man his own image and a
[1:39:10] spiritual being he didn't make man in
[1:39:12] his own image
[1:39:16] he made the man in the image of animal
[1:39:19] the physical man the two the genesis ii
[1:39:22] man
[1:39:23] is in the image of the animal
[1:39:34] something that was real
[1:39:38] but he made something spiritual first he
[1:39:41] condescended himself
[1:39:45] now what did let's see how is it
[1:39:49] he didn't send a son to die he came
[1:39:52] himself
[1:39:54] we think he sent a son see we're still
[1:39:56] trinitarian
[1:39:58] no that almighty god that we're talking
[1:40:01] about just kept condescending
[1:40:03] kept condescending then he come to the
[1:40:06] earth and he knew he needed an earth
[1:40:08] he just spoke the word he knew he needed
[1:40:11] this he needed that he just spoke the
[1:40:13] word
[1:40:13] he just kept speaking kept bringing it
[1:40:15] forth
[1:40:18] and then he brought it all into being
[1:40:20] then he just started from there in the
[1:40:21] natural of bringing it all the way down
[1:40:23] to where we're at now
[1:40:24] it's it's our father trying to reveal
[1:40:26] himself to us
[1:40:33] and he says let us make man who's he
[1:40:35] talking to
[1:40:38] not to another person
[1:40:42] he's thinking within himself i can give
[1:40:46] you quotes if you want him for whatever
[1:40:47] you want
[1:40:48] but the brother said he was talking to
[1:40:49] the to the animals
[1:40:52] how to make the man then he's saying
[1:40:55] he's talking to the angels
[1:41:02] then he says he's talking to himself
[1:41:09] that's what i've asked the question
[1:41:13] years ago there was a doctrine called
[1:41:15] son of man
[1:41:16] everybody was dealing with son of man
[1:41:18] son of man
[1:41:20] and i came in here and one day and i
[1:41:22] asked a simple question
[1:41:24] and maybe i shouldn't i saw all right i
[1:41:27] was not trying to be a smart cat sticker
[1:41:29] and
[1:41:29] i asked a simple question i said
[1:41:34] why are you dealing with son of man when
[1:41:37] you don't even know what the son of god
[1:41:38] is
[1:41:43] the son of god was god in human flesh
[1:41:47] do you realize that that son of god was
[1:41:49] the logos the theophany
[1:41:51] the word amen was the son
[1:41:57] read your bible get in schofield and
[1:41:59] read a little footnotes for him
[1:42:01] you'll find he knew that much so
[1:42:03] theologians knew
[1:42:04] that that first form of god was the
[1:42:06] logos was called the son of god
[1:42:15] he's real he just started coming this
[1:42:18] away
[1:42:20] he just started stepping down a notch as
[1:42:22] we'd call it or revealing himself to
[1:42:24] mankind come on musicians real quick
[1:42:28] think on these things
[1:42:32] we won't quit on this we'll just keep
[1:42:34] going
[1:42:36] but just remember in his mind
[1:42:42] in his mind
[1:42:46] what a wonderful thought of the mind of
[1:42:50] god
[1:42:54] that he could think of me and you
[1:42:58] his children
[1:43:01] isn't that something his offspring
[1:43:07] we are the children of god
[1:43:10] amen right
[1:43:14] there's a lot to the son of man remember
[1:43:17] the prophet said the only way he could
[1:43:18] be the father he wanted to be
[1:43:20] was to be the son of man we'll get to
[1:43:22] that one because i've been through that
[1:43:26] he became the son of man
[1:43:31] to be the father that he wanted to be
[1:43:34] the father he wanted to be was not
[1:43:36] satisfactory with adam and eve standing
[1:43:38] there
[1:43:39] because he knew that they'd fall
[1:43:42] yet he loved them and cherished them and
[1:43:44] protected them
[1:43:47] you see they come into full fution or
[1:43:51] reality
[1:43:52] when that god died on calvary to release
[1:43:54] that life
[1:43:56] to come back in me and you as to be the
[1:43:58] children he wanted us to be
[1:44:00] adam and eve never had to go through a
[1:44:03] new birth
[1:44:06] they were created the way they were
[1:44:10] but you and i have to go through a new
[1:44:11] birth to become the children
[1:44:15] the children of god to thank his
[1:44:18] thoughts
[1:44:20] but stan what we got brother
