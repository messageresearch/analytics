see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to Hebrews 6 where we've been reading and then Revelations 1 good to be in the house of the Lord just remember now this coming Saturday will be Bible study it's 6:00 here at the church come and be with us it should be on sanctification that's right and so just come and dwell with us and have a good time and also remember that brother Claude wi singer will be here preaching for us for the weekend so we're looking forward to that amen and brother Boyd was having you to turn around and sing you appreciate that for the the confidence in the the person to bring the word but there always the one going this way that's going to take care of us one back here behind us that's where the pictures are at what we believe the Lord Jesus look like he'll take care of us right Hebrews 6 and Revelations 1 father we thank you we love you Lord for all of the things that you've given unto us thank you most of all for your word that you've allowed us to be able to receive we ask you tonight that you'd just come and dwell in us and with us Lord and just open our eyes that we may see cuz we know who we're looking for and what we're looking at you know because we're looking to you we know you'll take care of it have your way bless the sick you said in your word you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so Just Have Your Way guide each one in Jesus name amen Hebrews 6 we've been reading 1 through 3 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment this will we do if God permit see as we always say that he never permitted Paul to go on to the change of the body but he's permitted and I believe here in the end time because I believe we're right here at that point don't you okay Revelations 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear witness of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now jump over to verse 10 we'll try to get to here I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet so you may be seated Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been on this this is message number three specifically dealing with the Book of Revelations and U you know I just want to make sure that we get it and get a correct understanding because you know this book has been called just about everything and Mankind has always tried to uh keep you from reading it and studying it and claiming that you couldn't understand it you know it was all like this that and the other but since the prophet came and gave us the message why can't we understand it I mean it was given through us I believe the reason that Satan wanted us to stay away from The Book of Revelations is the fact that the Book of Revelations is dealing exactly with the bride of Christ amen you know in the time on Earth and and what will happen and and showing us the the future and all all of the things but I want to just make sure we get it and get it in the correct order to understand you know because it says now the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him now we went through there and we've been in it and up and down and you know we had to kind of change a little bit and I hope that if you miss Sunday's message Sunday afternoon especially that you will go through it and listen to it because I was trying to explain uh basically how that God would limit himself in the bases that so you'd say well now look there that we don't believe in a trinity we read here the Revelation that that you know uh God gave to Jesus to give to John well that looks like it's got to be two or three people now brother Dale but no it's not it's the opening of the word revealing the word or in other words the time and the the opportunity to be able to receive and see God put a limit on the basis of himself to work that when he was in human flesh he would not even know when he would be coming cuz he said so right all right but the prophet of God said now this time on patmas see now he knows well that's what it is that's the Revelation that God give to Jesus right it's not a revelation of another God it's a revelation showing him of what he went through at Calvary and what going through at Calvary made a way that they could be a bride of Christ so that would be revealed to him now Jesus didn't know his own part in what he was doing right huh you read that you know if you want them I got them laying here but if you read the 12 read page 12 13 14 of the church age Book You'll see the whole thing you know there in front of you that this book then what it it's the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him now I want you to notice the point of how God gave it to him he gave it to an angel and the angel give it to John because I mean you you you got to read it there cuz that's what it is see all right because it says in verse one of revelation God give to Jesus then when you come on over signified it by his Angel unto his servant John but now I want you to this may be five years from now I don't know something I'm thinking on but uh I want you to get in mind now I want you to think and get in mind that you'll see in the Book of Revelations that you'll see that there will be that John's receiving something and he will receive it from an angel right but then there's times that it will not be John receiving from an angel right it'll be times that Jesus is speaking personally to John but brother Brandon says that on uh the only book that that John where uh Revelation see the only book page 12 13 Church AG book the book is usually term the revelation of St John but that is incorrect it is the revelation of Jesus Christ given to John for Christians of all ages it is the only book in the entire Bible that is written by Jesus himself through personally appearing to a scribe right all right so now you're going to have to deal in the Book of Revelations with an angel all right then you're going to have to deal with the basis that it'll be Jesus personally all right so now put that in your mind because some of these days it'll be needful when we get over about Revelations uh 19 and on through there about some things it'll help you very much to see that God can deliver through an angel right right but then at times he appears himself right now the way I like it is a statement brother Bram made one time and he made it like this he said that the message of redemption was was so important that he couldn't trust it with an angel now the message of redemption that's right he's he couldn't trust it with an angel he didn't even trust it with a prophet right he came himself right right now that should be a note to write down in your mind to keep close attention to that God can use Angels yes right but God can also speak himself righten so the Plan of Redemption was so important he wouldn't trust it with a prophet to bring cuz see a prophet couldn't die to purchase that for but he still couldn't trust it he came himself amen now there's some more quotes on over well on over that we fit in with that and I believe will help us understand when we get there but the main thing I want you to look at tonight is one thing we'll get to it in a minute who is this book of Revelations written about the Book of Revelations according to what we've read it's the revelation of Jesus Christ right all right now there's a lot of things up and down and what's going on it and the tribulations been there and the destroying of Babylon the the doing and all that but in all of that you find the revelation of Jesus Christ right you know that's really the key of the entire Bible right sure the entire Bible is the revealing of one true and living God all right but now it takes the people are you listening it takes the people to make manifest that Revelation all right it takes people to live you know the Bible this Bible is you say that's that's revealing God but you know what it's talking about people right Moses Joshua y right we want to look at it a lot of times as you know to the point of just to try to see God and that's wonderful but just remember how God is revealing himself he uses man to reveal himself all right right but now listen this is not only the Revelation about Jesus Christ and something that he didn't even understand that's on page 14 Church AG book but it was a spiritual Kingdom that was going he was going to build even he could not tell them about his place in it for the father had not revealed it unto him but now after his death and resurrection and at this particular time in his mediatorial ministry he is able to set forth here in this revelation of himself to John what his glory and presence in the church would mean and do all right now you've heard me say it many times read the book of Revelations and find Jesus Christ revealed by himself it won't work you said well does that mean a lot to us brother Dale well I I love it because if I want to read my story I I want to read the story about me right now you know I mean now all the other things in the Bible was about somebody right right you know Paul Peter James John the early church and then we'll get into the church ages and we'll emphasize that the that in the church ages this is what happened back there but here's what's happening here now this is ours so this is my Bible right amen this is my book it's written to me that's what you must think about your Bible it's something written to you read it that way but you know what then you'll find out you get the Book of Revelation it's written about you right the Book of Revelation is written about you amen and and what's taking place he said well there's a lot about the devil there's a lot about the seals there's a lot about yeah but that's just the natural story right it's just like in the Book of Esther you know that in the Book of Esther the name God is not even mention that's right because it's a historical record showing the Purity and the wonderful things about the children of Israel right see because that was what it was for so we could call it that's really the Book of Esther cuz that's what it was about right well that's a way I want us to look at the Book of Revelations you want to have something to read go read the book of Revelations well I just can't understand that there's too many symbols there's too many well you're thinking the wrong way amen right listen to The Prophet listen to the scriptures as I said even God will tell you A lot of times what this means he gets over about Verse 18 19 20 and he tells you what the candlesticks are what the stars are so just you know let him answer your questions all right right but now take with me l we've come over to a place and we'll get to it in a minute if we have time to get there if we don't we'll stop take it another one s but it's a blessing according to verse three just to be able to read the book amen now what about all of it was taught don't you read it and the scripture said it's blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy it's a blessing amen not a curse like people say don't read that now you get all messed up no it's like that man said that time don't read it to find out you're already messed up yeah that's the problem so you find out you're already messed up CU I like the the last part of the third verse where it says for the time is at hand now I believe it's time to for to have an understanding right you know I do I believe it's time to have an understanding you know that that the world has a lot of understanding of what we're talking about you know I mean that you turn the radio on and listen to the denominational preachers and sometimes they have a lot of understanding sometimes you wonder where they get it because you know where it's capable of getting it in things but still that's all right not you know not thr off on them just just just being the point to look at it like that all right now this is the Revelation then that God give to Jesus and he gave it to the angel the angel gave it to John and John writes it all right right now I want to emphasize that because see I want you to see what did it's you know sometimes the Angels dealing sometimes it's John sometimes it's Jesus I want you to think of that because to me it's very vital to understand right amen all right so now the it was told now the revelation God give to Jesus and he gave it to an angel to give to John now see if you took that point in every stage how would you be able to you know read verse two and see that John was right John said there was an angel come to him and he tells you what the angel done verse two what John says who who by record of the word of God the angel that come to him by record John's writing it down all right who by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw in other words all the Angels saw he tells John all right now so now listen then what does John say see now it's not the angel that says verse three that's John verse two is in between see and John telling you the angel told him and then John says blessed is he that read it see break it down like it's written amen I know people call me and say we don't understand you cuz you're you're you're too much of an intellect what's what's intellect when you're reading I mean 90% of you in here have have a lot more education I've got but see I I like to look at thing who's talking what's he talking about and is he talking about himself if not I'm like that man in the scripture you know that come wouldn't Phillip he was reading the scripture and Philip come up to him you know and said understand what I reading he said I can understand it un let somebody teach me right he said is this man talking about himself or is he talking about another that's right that's the way I like it so let's do that just a minute you know it may not mean anything to you but it does to me to be able to break it down and see now so John once he sees this he shouts out blessed is he that readeth they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written there in for the time is at hand that's his statement from what the angel told him about the revelation of Jesus Christ now what is your statement after all that God is revealed to you what is your statement can't you say blessed are they that can understand now look you say well you don't know I don't know well okay let's go to verse four and see after verse 1 and two the angel delivers to John he shouts Glory Hallelujah then what John now the angel was telling and John to write this right but John is putting it down John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne now what I like for you to do sometime don't have to do it now but I want you to know notice how many times A and D is there right I'm what does that mean and now we're going to get to it in a minute and you'll see why well I'll go ahead and say it to you because when we get down to verse 11 before he starts in verse 11 to say anything brother brandham says on patmas Vision paragraph 97 he said before you begin to write anything down I want you to know who I am amen right he said said for you begin to write down in other words I want you to know who I am well here's a man that's been preaching in for 60 years right cuz this is about 95 about somewhere around 65 years or something but now listen John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and you can translate that even see it's it's the word and and even is translated to either way okay grace be unto you and peace from him which is now John is writing to tell the people what God has given him and he's trying to show the US who's talking to him now who's talking to John so well an angel was talking to him that's good but he's telling us what Jesus said that the father gave him to bring okay the revelation of Jesus Christ so now look who is Jesus Christ Grace be unto you and peace from him which is do we need to go all the way through the scriptures with that to show you who's that talking about Jesus Christ which was H is he Hebrews 138 from him which is which was and which is to come who are we looking forward to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne so just translate that even in there and read it see when Paul said the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ God and Father look like two but read it God even father of our Lord Jesus Christ now that's the way your Prophet said you can translate so let's read it the way he translated verse four Grace be unto you even peace from him which is even which was even which is to come and from the seven even from the seven Spirits which are before his throne even from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness even the first begotten of the Dead even the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us even washed us from washed us from our sins in his own blood and ha made us Kings even priests unto God even his father to him be glory even Dominion forever and ever right any problem with reading it that way but does that help you understand right now my point is this look up how many times the word and is in the first seven or eight verses but just remember you're talking about one person right you're not talking about a Trinity right he's simply using and showing us who this is right right John is showing us who this is watch he's made us Kings and Priests unto his father and to him be glory even Dominion forever even ever behold he cometh with clouds even ever I shall see him even they also which Pierce him even all kindreds of the Earth shall wh because of him even so amen now look at the next verse is that red letter Edition in your Bible right you know that means Jesus speaking personally so now John's telling us what the angel said about him right he's telling us what he got but look what he says all of this person and all this all this is summed up into one thing I am Alpha and Omega the beginning even the ending say the Lord which is even which was even which is to come right the almighty that's not the angel talking that's Jesus himself he's showing you that's what he is he's all of this the one to come the one that was the one it is right read the Bible for yourself but read it with sensible understanding third grade reading and another you know what third grade reading is you know third grade reading is that you don't have enough sense to be able to figure out all these big words and things so you just do the best you can to read it huh and you know what third grade reading is you got to look at that word now anybody here with uh let's see Abby uh no n she's already enough um Levi you take that to them and you say uh what's in words right they don't know what them words are what you know about Levi's learn it a Hanah I mean aby's learning it n's got her working on on Words and I mean on things you know what does the this mean what does the word dog start with D but you know it's amazing what happens maybe you're can't remember maybe you're too smart you remember when you take something and look at the word I see it I don't have to go a n d i t u r n e d t o That's to s e e c t h e you don't do that do you right why because your mind has been captivated through studying to the basis that you just look at that word and there it is all right right but these little kids can't do that know well you know I think that's the way we've done the gospel right that we we try to look around to find out what it all means when we don't do it but get my point the angel gives John the understanding of who this is but once he finishes with the understanding to John he himself steps forth right he himself steps forward and just using simple little things you know to illustrate it uh years ago Zachary he couldn't read and uh he got kind of upset and most of you know the story he got a little upset about cuz they was going to make him go to kindergarten and uh he got pretty ill about it you know cuz he didn't want to go and he even got some ads about it he'd tell him say Well daddy next time we go on vacation just leave Mama at home cuz he didn't want to learn but you know what they finally got around to it and they said now poppy you got to do something cuz he got mad at Nanny and he got mad at his mother cuz he's going to send him to school well what are you going to do with a 5-year-old you know so I you know you pray well what can I say to him so I I I knew Zachary you know his nature and his ways and I said Zachary I said you know when we're sitting around right before Christmas and and we spell these words that we're going to buy you for Christmas these presents you don't know what that is do you he said no papa don't know I said well if you'll go to school and you learn to read then when we try to spell you'll know what we spelling you know what he went school the next day and he made a year that was what clicked in his mind and he was ready y all right now that's all I'm trying to do with you and me is to click that thing to where we don't have to spell it out a n d and n i I know that one t u r n e d what does that mean we don't have to do that in the gospel is what I'm talking about to get a seasoned in the gospel until we can look in the word of God and everywhere we look we find Jesus that's right is that not what your Prophet said amen he said if you don't find Jesus in every verse back up or maybe he said Christ make sure I get it right for the bigger ones you know he said if you if you don't see Christ in every verse he said back up and read it again because you missed y amen well when so and so we got so and so and so and so we got so and so and so and so we got so and so and I got so tired of that reading the first time in the Bible didn't you I really wasn't concerned about who we got who well see that's a record it was in the word of God then right in the middle of all of that you'll find a secret laying there A lot of times and it let's jump off the pages to you right amen all right now listen but when the angel gets through delivered the message to John about this person that person steps on the scene well is not that's what the message of the hour is supposed to do is not the message of the hour supposed to bring Christ to you and I I thought that's what the message would I didn't know it was all of this stuff that everybody talking about seals files plagues trumpets theophanies and all these big words that they think it makes them look so big it's the revelation of Jesus Christ that's right but as Jesus Christ stepped on the scene to you from what you what you've read has he come on the scene to you as to what you studied or can somebody deprogram you now and give you a trinity come on if it's not a revelation they sure do it okay so you getting the point so verse n watch I John this is not what the angel told him this is not what Jesus told him this is what John is saying I John and he's going to tell you where he was at and what he was doing there John is not the angel not Jesus not God so look at it I John who Al look in glasses where read I John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ what watch was in the aisle that is called patmas watch far the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ now you remember the reason he was put out there was because he was trying to put the he was trying to get it into Scrolls in other words the the writings of the Bible and you know uh this is John now not John the Baptist this is John that was there when Jesus was with him the John Walking With Jesus that wrote the Book of John all right now so he's telling us where he's at and what he's there for he knows why He's there right he was trying to bring it down to get it into Scrolls and things that could be held by the people and kept and read and they put him on the patas you know the story that the prophet told how they even boiled him in oil for 24 hours to try to get the spirit out of him and couldn't and they thought his so bewitched cuz they couldn't burn him up but let decided they' better get rid of him so they throw him out on on patmas and patmas was kind of like alcatra there was no way to get on and off of it and sharks had eat you up you tried to get out and things so they throw him out there where he was nothing but snakes and rocks and things you it was like a prison place right he knew what he was out there far right so that's what he's telling you I was out there for this reason now watching I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet now if you notice the Vex verse it says saying that's in Black letter cuz that's part of what John is talking about then it jumps to red letter right are you looking at it and seeing it you know what's the point he said I was in the spirit on the Lord's day now we'll just title this Lord's day because I want to get this point to you he said I was in the spirit on the Lord's day now what is the Lord's day now just in case somebody comes along and says well I know this and I'll just give it to you brother Ram was calling at one time you know that he called the Lord's Day the day of the Resurrection in about two times or three he called the Lord's day Sunday could he said like we don't sell on the Lord's day he's calling it Sunday but then when he come on down in later as he began to understand and not later as far as way off time he began to talk about the Lord to day amen right and he said now the Seventh Day Adventist he said they believe that Saturday is the Lord's day and said the Protestants they believe that Sunday is the Lord's day and he wasn't arguing about it right because you know what the Sabbath is the old the Saturday is the Old Testament Sabbath and that was the Lord's day of the Old Testament nothing wrong with it but then Sunday being the first day of the week because of the Resurrection then it can be called The Lord's Day right we see then you come down and say well brother Ram now John said he was in the spirit right now you know how he covered all that so you can go through it he said the the the key to all understanding is to first get in the spirit amen and he said that's what John done amen he got in the spirit and he said there's our problem we don't get in the spirit come on and the scripture says if I he say you know if I do this or what it Paul said let let me do it in the spirit you know if I sing let me sing in the spirit if I do that whatever we do supposed to be done in the spirit of God you agree all right now but he says but he was in the spirit on the Lord's day amen now brother brandom what is the Lord's day that you would be coming on down to I'm doing this kind of reverse to what maybe I should but I want to get this out of the way of the Lord's day and then we'll do that have two tonight and we'll take a rest later page 51 Church age book there he stands one like son of man as the jewel is beautified by the mounting of the ring so he is glorified in the midst of his churches it is the Lord's day for John sees him standing not as a priest but as the coming judg now he's telling you what this is in Revelations one now the golden girdle is no longer around in the waist where the priest must wear it as he ministers to God in the holiest place but it is now around his shoulders for he is not now the priest but the judge right now has John 5:22 come to pass for the father judges no man but ha committed all judgment unto the son his service has been rendered the priesthood is over the days of Prophecy are finished he stands GED as the judge now he said this is what happened here in Revelations 1 okay I told you I'm having to use this kind of a way and want to get back to you right patmas Vision 1960 1204 the evening service paragraph 167 he's coming down on the one clothed one golden candlesticks one like the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about to pouch with a golden girdle now here's more proof that this Doctrine is right there now here's more proof that this Doctrine is right about being the Lord's day did you notice he was not a priest during this time neither was he a king he was a judge notice a priest a high priest when he went into the sanctuary or went into the ministry to the service he tied himself around the waist tying his girdle around the waist meant that was that he was serving right amen never tied it over his shoulders but here he comes out walking out with the girdle tied around the top now listen to the wording walking out with a girdle tied around the top with a sash over his shoulder G about the PS the breast with a golden girdle gted up high what is it an attorney a judge a judge with his sash over his shoulders GED up here not down as a priest see that he shows he wasn't in his priesthood now John went all the way into the Lord's day and saw him coming as judge that's right now that's what he sees in Revelations 1 okay we get time I'll get back to the other part of it you know what I've preached but he's seeing him as judge y he's showing him as the judge at the day of judgment the Lord's Day the prophet said is when man's Days Are Over The Lord's day is the Judgment Day at the white Trump right okay right that's read attiring Church age 1960 128 between his Priestly operation when the sanctuary left then we find him standing there John said he was in the spirit on the Lord's day not the seventh day not Sunday that's all mistaken we found that out searched it through the Scripture it was the Lord's day this is the day of man the coming of the Lord will be his day we find him in the Lord's day when he's when he seeing the Lord he had on a snow white high and we know that represents a judge another thing he was not priest then cu the priest was tied around the middle mean service but he was tied around the paths up here which meant that he was a judge amen and we see him walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and now we took back to the Ancient of Days being white at the white Throne judgment when Daniel saw him come to the ancient of days whose hair was white as snow and he goes on telling about the old English judges mark of the beast 1961 217 John didn't see him on the Sabbath day or on Sunday he seen him in the Lord's Day the coming of the Lord when he was judged right not know these other days we see him over in here we see him when he come Daniel saw him and he come with 10,000 time 10,000s of his Saints is that right and the books were open and another book was open which was the book of life and every man see there comes up your lukewarm Church sleeping virgin here's the real one with him come from glory after being at the wedding supper and there was a c white this white Throne the Judgment set white Throne judgment well there you are pmas Vision part page 48 seal book we know that the Lord's we know what the Lord's day is not if it is not Saturday or Sunday what is it well let's put it in this way today is certainly not the Lord's day this is man's day it is man's doing man's work man's Church man's idea of worship man's everything for it is man's world Cosmos but the day of the Lord is coming yes it is it is just that that at this time of the revelation of Jesus Christ John was taken up by the spirit and transported by the spirit to that graay that day is coming the days when the the days of man is over the kingdoms of this world will then become the kingdoms of our God the day of the Lord is when the judgments fall okay now I can go ahead and say it but it get you confusing but after that comes to the Millennium so we'll turn over the page to read make sure we get the right order question and answerers 54 103 talking about coming first time to get his bride second time to receive his bride third time with his bride he comes to redeem her he comes to rapure her and be caught away in the time of the plagues and so forth return back after the Millennium lives through the Millennium then the great king and queen comes down for the Judgment the watch thr judgment set the books was open and there stands the redeemed Holy Ghost born Church of the Living God standing there in her beauty to judge the books were open judgment was set and every man was judged thus that was The Sinner and another book was open not for the Holy Ghost Bride she will never C take it cuz she's in the Rapture now if you just get an order of times then you'll see the bride can't go through the tribulation that's right amen she goes up in the Rapture the tribulation Falls right after the tribulation has fallen Armageddon I mean yeah Armageddon comes then the millennial reign and then the white Throne comes so we get your order you'll see that it lays perfectly question and answer 64 8:23 CU a bride don't sit on the don't go before the Judgment she sets on the Judgment seat amen that's it now notice in this second Resurrection when they come up then Satan's loose out of his prison for a little season then the judgment is sent now watch Jesus with the Bri as king and queen set at the throne white Throne judgment and the books were open and the books of the Sinners and the he goes on to give you that scripture says that will'll judge even angels right right but do you see what I'm trying to get John got in the spirit on the Lord's day before the church ages ever started before God even wrote about the church ages John is taken in the spirit all the way to the white Throne judgment that's right okay see then when we get on over a little bit if I got time in a minute we'll drop back but see we don't go to the white Throne judgment we set on the white throne with him all right let's prove that okay let's read some scriptures that will fit together so let's start off with Revelations 1 where you're at let's get a picture he said well brother there we done Hur you preach about that that's bried form that's good but I want you to get it anchored into you what it is so let's read verse one let's read re uh Revelation 1114 or 13 and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one lik un to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PS with a golden girdle and you know what the truth of there is paps is femish there's got to be a view of the Bride Watch but look at what he showing verse 14 his head and his tires were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were a flame of fire right back to Daniel that's right Daniel 7 amen hold your Bible open hold your Bible on Revelations where you're at one and look at Daniel now while you're turning there Daniel you know it's kind of hard to find it's 910 if you got a Scofield bible okay sa you looking around and it's right before uh Amos right in there right before Joel you know cuz that's a hard book for me to find all right it's right after Ezekiel okay everybody got it okay so let's reread now what this fell looks like or this person verse 14 his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were a flame of fire now let's go over to Daniel 7 and verse 9 and you'll see this is the white Throne judgment and it should take it out of your mind when I get back to it if we have time that this is the bride of Christ everybody got it Daniel 7:9 I beheld till the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and his ha of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels is burning so look back over here what does it say his head and his hairs were white like wool white as snows and his eyes were as a flame of fire right same place isn't it am man this is the white thr judgment right okay the anchor it down let's go over to Revelation 20 keep your finger between these you know hold like C cuz we'll go from one to the other back to the other so you won't have to be flipping and flipping just all your there Revelations 19 excuse me 20 everybody got it Revelation 20 verse 11 and I saw a white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away there was found no place for them and that's saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open same as it says if you go on down in verse 10 of Daniel 7 and verse 10 it talks about judgment was set and the books were open books plural now brother randam says page 464 of the 10 virgins the first book is the book of the Sinners so that's Go's going to be judged right who's that other book it's the book to see whether or not your name is in it books not just one book you see it's just the Bible yeah because the Bible contains the people that will never be saved the Bible contains the foolish virgins the Bible contains the bride so sure it's the Bible but it's called books go into the church age book I'll be glad to go through it with you with Brother r or it's invisible Union invisible Union where he says that it says books he said you will get confused there right cuz it's not two books it's the Bible the Bible contains a record of the people who are going to be killed right it contains the record of the foolish virgins it contains the record of the Bride so books all right so then verse 12 now still that and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was open watch that which is The Book of Life and the dead was judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their Works judas's name was written in the book of life now that's in the church A's book be glad to cover it we but it was not written in the Lamb's Book of Life section which is eternal life because judas's name was written in the book of life but his name could be taken out of the book of life you can have a name taken out of the book of life but not taken out of the Lamb Book of Life The Eternal section right right that's how perfect God's word is what and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered of the Dead which were in them this is white thr judgment and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell was cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire so at the white Throne judgment there books Daniel says these books he gives you the picture of the of the the one sitting there with the white high like wool The Book of Revelations gave you this same symbol of the white like wool right so are you following me now let's read it we'll cover just a minute I was in the spirit we're back in Revelations 101 I was in the spirit 110 excuse me on the Lord's day well I can go to 101 do the same thing CU brother R said Revelations 10:1 when the angel comes down one foot on landing on sea he said it's Revelations 1 right 14 amen we're looking for some kind of a great big something to happen out there and not seeing is what Jesus Christ is doing like my brother-in-law was the badest preacher you know he he believed that Beast was great big animal walking across the earth I said where's that going to deceive anybody I mean you see the thing great big old whale war stuff a few weeks after then I told my wife I said Robert's probably holl and Glory that there that great big beast come walking up but it's dead you know but listen and I was in the spirit on the Lord's day now John was taken to the Judgment Day right the description of Revelations 1 through 14 and all the clothing f it's exactly Daniel 7:9 the high the world of things so what is it talking about the Ancient of Days but remember in the Book of Daniel there is thousands upon thousands ministering unto him which is the bride that's right she sits in judgment with him on the Judgment seat amen not before the Judgment seat to be judged cuz come on you've already went in the Rapture you went through the millennium right you went through all of that in eternity and then you got to come to the white throne and be judged to decide whether or not you can go to heaven there's something wrong with your mentality that's true think and just take it like it is so what was John transported to and he heard and I heard and heard behind me a great voice and of a trumpet saying and when he heard that trumpet look at it red letter it's not an angel it's not a prophet was God himself amen speaking to John right I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last look and is in black jumping right back to word over the other what thou seeth write in the book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus unto samna unto pergamus and un tiarra and unto Sardis and under Philadelphia and under lady oia all right now look what John says not the angel told him John says I turned to see The Voice amen he had heard a voice brother Ram I'm be glad to show it to you he said John didn't turn to see the person goes come on Church John already knew who this was he knew the person was Jesus what I'm getting that John knew that voice he'd live with it for three and A2 years he was turning to see Jesus y because that was his voice y amen right right y I mean we's in a crowd in the story and they're yaking yaking yaking yaking yacking and I see hey Danny you know Danny's not going to look for Brother Dean right why cuz he knows my voice he's been around enough long enough to know my voice I can't even disguise my voice on the telephone every time I pick it up everybody knows who I am most of the time even anybody heard it one time they say know Sam cuz they know my voice it's just a unique one it's you know it's mine but listen John turned as the prophet said not he was turning expecting to see Jesus Christ why because verse 11 tells you who this was that the voice sounded it was the almighty God Jesus Christ standing there but look at him when he turned and I turned to see the voice that fate with me in being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks he was expecting to see Jesus he saw him than Lord right cuz it was putting symbols was it he saw seven golden candles six now am I TR do we need to drop down and read the mystery verse 20 The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in the right hand of the seven and the Seven golden Candlestick the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the seven candles which th saw us are the seven churches right now God interprets that in red letter right watch me and I turned to see The Voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks listen to what your Prophet said you've heard this over and over and over most of you have anyway if I can find it paragraph 180 of why we are not a denomination preached in 1958 927 now if you ever notice watch these churches ages then we'll close then in the morning we're going to pick up these other things watch under the golden candlesticks of the Jewish Tabernacle in the inside of the shoe bread and so forth there were seven golden candlesticks all of you know that and there are seven Church ages that speaks of seven Church ages alike if you notice in Revelations 1 we find Jesus standing in the seven Church ages the seven golden candlesticks when he turned and saw one like unto the son of man standing clothed with her how was it what brother R said now how was it it was a bride standing in the candlesticks dra out that's his interpretation so what are you looking at in the Book of Revelation you're looking at the ride well just got all kind of look like this and look like that look like that see you're trying to figure it out right just read amen what is this bride look like and I turned to see The Voice being turned I saw seven golden scandles when in and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man it didn't say it was the son of man right I've got one at home I'll bring back to you later brother BR said he saw the Son of God he said no no no it's said Son of you're not getting it he saw the Son of God which is the church down to the church ages that was Son of God but when you get to hear it's already to the white Throne it's son of man right it's over with that's right in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like another son of man clothe with a garment down to the foot and gir about to pouch with a golden girdle now remember p is femish okay you want that seven Church ages preach 1954 512 he talking about the Holiness of Jesus covering her oh wait let's go back and redress that's what the what the spirit said the candlesticks all right now in the 13th verse and in the midst of seven candlesticks one like the son of man who one like him who was this his bride one like him watch How It Was clo with the Garment down to the foot the holiness of Jesus Christ covering her has washed us from our sins with his own blood all right G about the paths not a man a woman the gospel that held the power and of and glory of God over the body of Christ heard about the passs you remember down here when I was saying to you what ago was reading it it's not around it's over the shoulders but said it was a sash hanging over his shoulders but said he was G about the passs it's got to be a feminist description right that's what is that's what he's describing a feminist description all right now let's prove it and we'll just keep on reading and I'll come back to this later G about the pouch with a golden verle verse 14 and his head and his HS were white like wolf remember white Throne judgment as white as snow and his eyes were a flame of fire listen and his feet like a Define Bry as they were burned in the furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters page 57 Church age book brother brandham says many witnesses many preachers CU Waters means people right amen amen what's he seeing the bride and in his right hand Seven Stars and is out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength listen to this and when I saw him I fell at his feet is dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me red letter now who is this Jesus Christ fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of death and Hell amen write the things which thou H has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be here after let's see page 122 patmas Vision which would be Church age book brother brandham said this is not a Prophet this is God this is not an angel this is God he said but where's he shown in Bride form that's right it is in Bride form yes now as we go on through the the church ages and the different things we pick it up we'll prove that and then we'll come back to our day cuz what has been our point of what we've been talking about going on to Perfection how much more perfect could you think about being than to see you the place that you used to think now come on now some of you in here would say well I never did believe nothing well it's in the same shape don't matter but we used to believe that we all had to go to White through judgment right I didn't believe that well if you didn't that's all right but if you did you're a liar why don't you be on we thought we was going to the white Throne judgment cuz we thought nobody could do nothing unless they went to the white Throne judgment we thought we had to go to the white Throne judgment to be judged but we never considered anything about the blood of Jesus Christ being making us so perfect until we don't have to go to the white Throne right we used to believe we had to go there and it'd be decided one of these days where we going to heaven or not no that new birth decides it here you get the new birth you don't have to go to the white Throne judgment sure there's a judgment of the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad yes but the bride that's not a judgment of eternal life that's a judgment of the Deeds that we have in our life that if we don't get rid of them we'll have to answer before the rest of the body of Christ but the bride does not go to the white thr judgment that's right she has nothing to be judged by right that's right was out at a certain place I won't make too many statements cuz when I do them a lot of people get offended we was in a certain place and this brother he said you know said I think my wife is stood the test said you know what I'm going to move her to town where we got running water now I can call Nam if you like but we won't in places cuz I there in other words he married his wife and to see whether she was a good wife or not he put her out in old sloppy house where they didn't have no running water no bathroom no nothing to see if she stood the test now brother dick how many years did you try sister Gail to see whether she stood the test or not or did you take her right off the bat for every good and bad it was going to go right I mean come on Amen did you put your wife to a test to see if she would be a good wife then you decided she's a pretty good wife I think I'll marry her I certainly didn't mind I didn't test her but many of you have heard me tell the story that before I married her and I was a sinner I told her I would not marry her until I told her my life I didn't know brother brandham and what he Ted I was just an honest human being I wanted her to know what she was marrying and I told her the girls and the problems I'd had in life and I said you don't have to tell me nothing nothing cuz I never put her to a test I was marrying her because I loved her Jesus Christ don't put us to its head to see whether or not we're bride he loves us he may have to chasen us yet right me and my wife have been it's been a wonderful situation in life but we've had our problems and I had to chasen her she had to chasen me of course most of you men don't agree with that side of it that she's chasing me a whole lot that's not part of whether or not that's CZ she loves me cuz you wanted me to do right the bride don't have to wait to learn if you get what I'm talking about before God ever started the church agj is to write what they were about now the first church age begun about ad 95 oh excuse me ad50 first church age started about ad50 all now this is about 9596 and John is shown how beautiful the bride looks that she's standing you can't separate her from him go over in Revelations what is it 21 22 the coming of the city and look what John talks about he describes the city coming down he describes it as a bride he describes the bride coming as the city really right because it's just Alik who is this standing here all almighty God but in his bride form to show how much he loves her and he's already taken before we started our church age of the seventh age God had already showed how beautiful we are amen before he wrote anything about all of the bad stuff of the lady of see in age he's already showed the bride how good she is why can't you read the Bible like that sometime you want to see yourself read the book of Revelation and see what God thinks about you is it not in the church ages where the Prophet would cover how they Washed by the blood how they T's nothing what is Page 31 Church AG book if we accept the fact that Jesus Christ died for us we must accept the fact that we're just as righteous as God is I'm quoting from page 31 Church A's book he said to reject one is to reject the other y that's if you reject the fact that you are just as righteous as God is you are rejecting the new birth that he gave you right that's what your Prophet said amen but she goes to shows already all the way to the white throne and her sitting on the throne a beautiful picture come on Brothers a beautiful picture all the way over to the Lord's day when the days of man is over with he shows that before we ever started the ages what he thought about the bride that would be in the ages now let me ask you a final question if God already saw us the bride you know around the world the bride then is there any way that we can ever keep from coming to that I mean there any way you can keep from coming from what God already knowed about you I'm serious I want to know is there any way that you would not come to that I mean God have you ever seen anything God come down today brother colie and he show you tomorrow at 12:00 well you know what in a way the world can end I don't care how many Adam bombs they drop I don't care what they do it can't end at 12:00 on the sure even going to be 12:00 he's already showed the bride and how perfect she is amen you know I'm about ready to accept the fact that that's talking about us you know that brother brandham never called you bride now don't misunderstand me he used the word bride in many forms back before the seals broke but when he come into the seals he got over so far he said I call you bride he had never said that before he talked to the church he had used the word bride but he never said I call you bride until the opening of the seals what's stand 194 red book 194 and the red book day of redemption anybody have a need let's stand together and just worship believe that God has already showed us he's already showed us all the way SS on the white now that don't end at all folks go by this prophet he showed us already in the future home right showed us in the future home your brother's got a hurt in an arm shoulder side let's just believe God's word father we lay our hands upon our brother believe in your word that by your stripes he heal it's not what we say Satan can argue with us but he can't argue with you so just let it be you speaking father you say by your stri I hope you understood what I'm trying to say revelation God G to Jesus to get an angel together to John did that angel get when Jesus stepped out in person said wait a minute now I'm supposed to go deliver that message no he stepped back was happy to see him move on the scene look your Redemption anybody else that didn't have a need Heaven po are shaking Church your stretchy we thank you Father stretch Del this in Jesus name anybody else just let's believe and let's see God has already showed you that can believe what's in that book book of Revelation it already shows you how perfect you are how beautiful you are Propet already showed you reach Perfection Jesus Christ Paul said going on go already show the Bri redemp men's hearts are failing for be with the spirit your look your Redemption is the prophet of God said it like this my you got a case in court said you try to find you a good lawyer he said you feel better but said you still got a problem he said well what would happen if you
