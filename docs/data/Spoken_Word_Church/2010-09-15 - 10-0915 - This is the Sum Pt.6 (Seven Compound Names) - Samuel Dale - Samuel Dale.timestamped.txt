[0:02] i want to see
[0:04] you
[0:08] open the eyes of my heart
[0:12] open the eyes of my
[0:28] see
[0:31] shining in the light of your glory
[0:36] pour out your power and love as we sing
[0:49] shining in the light of your glory
[0:54] pour out your power in love
[1:10] holy
[1:24] i want to see him don't you good to see
[1:28] everybody in the house of the lord
[1:29] if you'd like to turn in your scriptures
[1:31] turn where we've been reading in hebrews
[1:33] 8 and ecclesiastes 12.
[1:37] enjoy the brother that came to be with
[1:39] us for the weekend
[1:41] hope you did had a good time with him
[1:43] i'm looking forward to hearing from him
[1:45] about
[1:46] you know a church to be started there in
[1:49] in israel because as far as i know
[1:51] there's groups
[1:52] there's people there and there's been
[1:54] some groups there but there's never been
[1:56] a
[1:57] message church as we'd call it to be
[2:00] placed there in israel now i don't think
[2:03] a message church would have anything to
[2:05] do with 144 thousand
[2:07] you know i just don't believe it that
[2:08] way some years ago believed that
[2:11] they were the prophet to be in the end
[2:14] time you know and
[2:15] they were supposed to go through israel
[2:16] before the rapture and the bride was
[2:18] supposed to be with them and
[2:20] everything else i just never have went
[2:22] along with all that
[2:23] i just kind of wait and let god take
[2:25] care of the things i gotta
[2:27] notice back there a while ago that we
[2:28] got it made until the year 2019 because
[2:31] this guy predicting that
[2:33] that's when the rapture's going to take
[2:34] place 2019 well that's a good time you
[2:37] know that's well down the road
[2:39] but i'm not wanting to be around here
[2:41] that long
[2:42] that would make me quite a many years
[2:45] older and i
[2:46] don't care nothing about it but you know
[2:48] so you just get all kind right
[2:52] amen remember now the fellowship meeting
[2:54] will be in alabama we will be leaving my
[2:56] house about
[2:57] 10 30 saturday and also remember that
[3:01] the
[3:01] children are going to the youth camp and
[3:04] they will be leaving on friday so
[3:06] remember these and
[3:07] keep them in your prayers and wade will
[3:09] be leaving friday to go
[3:11] to oklahoma to preach for the weekend
[3:14] and all but
[3:15] just pray that the lord would would take
[3:17] care of everybody and
[3:18] keep us all safe amen hebrews 8 and
[3:21] ecclesiastes 12.
[3:23] our heavenly father we thank you for the
[3:25] day and the time that we're living upon
[3:27] the earth and
[3:28] thank you for you and your word lord
[3:29] that we don't have to be
[3:31] concerned about dates and times and
[3:33] seasons and predictions that people make
[3:36] all we've got to do is just be ready
[3:38] against the day
[3:39] whenever that you would choose and you
[3:42] said that no man would know the day nor
[3:44] the hour so
[3:45] we'll just wait upon you and just
[3:48] believe your word it'll be right on time
[3:49] everything is right
[3:51] exactly the way that it's supposed to be
[3:54] but lord
[3:54] just help us to be ready against the day
[3:57] we ask you to guide us now as we read
[4:00] your words you come and speak to our
[4:01] hearts
[4:02] and lord just give us that understanding
[4:04] in jesus name
[4:06] amen hebrews
[4:10] 8 1 and then ecclesiastes
[4:14] 12.
[4:18] now of the things which we have spoken
[4:20] and remember what it said
[4:22] what is it all seven chapters previous
[4:26] about the lord jesus christ all right
[4:29] now the things which we have spoken this
[4:32] is the son
[4:33] we have such an high priest who is set
[4:35] on the right hand
[4:37] of the throne of the majesty in the
[4:39] heavens
[4:40] all right now we'll go to
[4:44] ecclesiastes
[4:48] and remember that's the summing up or
[4:50] the finishing
[4:51] of what ecclesiastes the preacher had to
[4:54] say and then he says in verse
[4:56] 13 let us hear the conclusion of the
[4:59] whole matter
[5:00] what is the conclusion of the whole
[5:02] matter of all things what
[5:04] fear god and keep his commandments for
[5:06] this is the whole duty
[5:08] of man you may be seated or that is
[5:12] blessing to the reading of the word
[5:16] now we've been
[5:20] studying about the sum of all things or
[5:24] the finishing up the completion
[5:27] we've been talking and the brother there
[5:29] sunday afternoon was preaching about you
[5:31] know
[5:31] uh coming from a
[5:34] partial realization to perfect or
[5:37] whatever and coming up and
[5:39] and i hope that it would was helping you
[5:41] to to see that's what we've been trying
[5:43] to say
[5:44] but i believe in understanding the bible
[5:46] that
[5:47] if you just jump into something and you
[5:50] know
[5:50] you you've never seen it nothing you've
[5:53] never heard about you jump into it
[5:54] and somebody tells you something glory
[5:56] we got it
[5:58] well that could be true and
[6:02] i don't believe it is because you've got
[6:04] to have a
[6:06] background to be able to
[6:09] understand anything that is in the bible
[6:13] or the prophet's message you know no it
[6:15] you got to have a background
[6:18] in in taking a background then that
[6:20] gives you something to stand on
[6:23] to where that when the finished product
[6:26] is
[6:27] spoken of or brought into view then you
[6:30] will understand what it is
[6:32] and and that's what we believe and
[6:34] that's what we've been trying to do
[6:35] now if you remember last wednesday night
[6:38] when we were talking about
[6:40] and and i brought that back to you
[6:42] because i want to tie this
[6:44] in together we're going to speak
[6:46] probably tonight and maybe sunday
[6:47] morning at least i don't know
[6:49] i'm gonna try to get through but it'll
[6:52] be on the seven
[6:53] redemptive names of jehovah
[6:57] all right are the seven compound names
[6:59] of jehovah
[7:01] and if you'll run in that like that
[7:04] on your computer and just run in seven
[7:07] compound names of jehovah do you know
[7:10] who appears first
[7:15] the first way place you can check on
[7:20] spoken word church lula george
[7:24] that is we are the first one on the list
[7:28] that gives you a place to be able to
[7:31] study
[7:32] the seven compound names of jehovah
[7:35] and then the next goes right on straight
[7:36] into brother branham
[7:38] and some of the tapes and the books and
[7:40] things in order to do but
[7:42] i thought that was very interesting
[7:44] because we make the first of the list
[7:47] because that's also we're number one on
[7:49] the list or they don't have to hunt for
[7:50] us
[7:51] they know right where we're at but you
[7:53] know i'm not concerned with anything
[7:56] other than one thing
[7:58] and that's it i was praying there to be
[8:00] ready against the day
[8:02] when the lord will finish his coming you
[8:05] know and make it into a manifestation
[8:07] we spoke about that for quite a while
[8:10] that to seeing that the coming of the
[8:12] lord is a revealing of his word
[8:14] and that he started his second coming on
[8:16] the day of pentecost
[8:17] but it will be finished in this life's
[8:19] days because there's a lot of things
[8:20] about his coming
[8:21] that is here in the end time to be made
[8:24] manifest
[8:25] but can be made manifest like the
[8:26] prophet said
[8:28] quickly because he said that the biggest
[8:30] portion of the old testament was
[8:32] fulfilled in a matter of a few hours
[8:34] at calvary so then we're not you know
[8:37] sitting around waiting on something but
[8:39] we're also not jumping
[8:41] out to conclusions and running away
[8:44] ahead we're just waiting
[8:45] on god to manifest himself all right
[8:49] now and in doing it we got to talking
[8:51] about
[8:53] you know the seven compound names of
[8:55] jehovah
[8:56] and the point that we were trying to get
[8:59] across
[8:59] is what will be very valuable tonight to
[9:02] understand
[9:03] is that
[9:07] brother branham you know brother dr bess
[9:10] had that point of arguing with him about
[9:12] it you know and everything and
[9:13] about divine healing and brother
[9:16] bosworth took to
[9:17] the point from brother branham and went
[9:19] up to speak on it
[9:21] and he asked a man a simple question he
[9:24] said does the seven compound names of
[9:26] jehovah
[9:27] apply to jesus christ yes or no
[9:31] all right see if he said uh no
[9:34] on any of the seven then
[9:38] he would have been totally out of the
[9:40] word but to say
[9:42] yes to any of the seven he would have
[9:45] had to agree that all the other six
[9:47] would tie together
[9:49] he so he was tied his hands and brother
[9:51] random said i didn't even think of that
[9:53] said he didn't
[9:54] know where to go because that was his
[9:56] the main point of what he was saying
[9:58] but now remember we were talking about
[10:00] and we'll get to
[10:02] our righteousness over in the compound
[10:04] names you know
[10:05] maybe tonight but remember we were
[10:07] talking about
[10:08] the fact that brother branham on
[10:10] paragraph or page 31
[10:12] and i gave it to you it's on the back of
[10:14] your notes
[10:15] uh the last part and i just gave it back
[10:19] to you it's on the back one
[10:21] of the notes doesn't have a number on it
[10:25] but brother brown said
[10:28] by our union in jesus christ
[10:33] that we have become the very
[10:35] righteousness of god
[10:37] amen by being in jesus christ
[10:41] it's not me and you now it's christ in
[10:44] you the scripture says the hope of glory
[10:47] all right see then it's not what we do
[10:49] it's what he's already done
[10:52] but we must accept what he's done right
[10:55] but if we accept the fact that he died
[10:58] for us
[11:01] then we will have to accept the fact
[11:04] that we're just as righteous as god is
[11:07] right
[11:08] because the prophet sitting there to
[11:10] reject one
[11:11] is to reject the other to accept one
[11:14] is to accept the other well i just don't
[11:17] see how i can be right
[11:18] you can't me and you can't be righteous
[11:24] is his righteousness imparted unto
[11:27] us our righteousness is filthy rise of
[11:30] scripture says
[11:31] the best we could do would be problems
[11:35] with it
[11:36] but yet to accept what he done for us
[11:41] then would make us just as righteous as
[11:43] he is
[11:44] if you say well when i brother dale i
[11:46] believe i'm saved but i'm not
[11:48] perfect well
[11:52] what are you talking about right right
[11:54] but we went through the scriptures
[11:56] our word said be therefore perfect even
[11:58] as your father in heaven is perfect
[12:00] right and we went through the scriptures
[12:02] where it says that if our righteousness
[12:04] does not exceed the righteousness
[12:06] of the scribes and pharisees we won't
[12:08] even be able to enter heaven
[12:10] right so it's necessary for us to
[12:13] understand when the prophet said that
[12:16] the revelation of it
[12:18] was missing all right
[12:21] because he said it's not real to the
[12:23] majority of god's children
[12:27] in other words born-again believers
[12:29] right
[12:30] it's not real to the majority of the
[12:33] born-again believers
[12:35] that want that he is our savior
[12:40] and we can go along with that right but
[12:43] that
[12:44] we're just as righteous as he is
[12:47] well i just can't go along with that now
[12:50] see the reason you can't
[12:52] because it hasn't been revealed to you
[12:54] right
[12:55] that's no problem right it hasn't been
[12:58] revealed
[12:58] amen see have you even asked god to
[13:01] reveal it
[13:02] well i don't want him to reveal
[13:03] something right
[13:07] don't worry about it he won't
[13:12] he won't reveal anything that's not
[13:13] right
[13:15] because he can't right but now once
[13:22] then what's the point that we're going
[13:24] to be talking about in the seven
[13:25] compound names of jehovah
[13:28] that if we accept one of those names
[13:32] and it's there's more than seven
[13:36] all right you you've got more than seven
[13:39] in the redemptive names
[13:43] because there's only one name anyway and
[13:45] that name is jesus
[13:46] but there's more you've got rosa sharon
[13:48] lily the valley the bright morning star
[13:50] the alpha the omega
[13:52] you've got a lot of titles
[13:55] but if you'll check it you'll see that
[13:58] they're all
[13:58] contained in the seven compound names
[14:03] that are listed of jehovah all right
[14:07] now in doing it that way then
[14:11] if we accept one we must accept the
[14:14] other
[14:17] if we reject one of them
[14:22] we're rejecting the other
[14:26] but now watch that as we try to go
[14:28] through it but what i want you to do
[14:31] is i want us to read
[14:35] these things that the prophet had to say
[14:39] all right and then keep these
[14:42] and over lay backwards and forth
[14:45] in the message as we begin to go along
[14:48] you know to see the things that we're
[14:51] seeing all right
[14:52] now they won't all be together or just
[14:55] want to be exactly onto this
[14:57] we'll just be preaching from it to try
[14:59] to understand
[15:00] but let's just read some things brother
[15:02] branham said about it
[15:05] now first off remember if he's jehovah
[15:08] jireh
[15:09] the lord's provided sacrifice then he
[15:13] must be
[15:14] jehovah's canoe which is our
[15:16] righteousness
[15:19] and to accept one is to accept the other
[15:21] or reject one is to reject the other
[15:24] and if you think that you can have the
[15:27] new birth
[15:28] that new birth is where the
[15:30] righteousness is dwelling at because
[15:32] the body and spirit is not even dealing
[15:35] with righteousness
[15:36] it's right dealing with trying to be
[15:38] right
[15:40] because that's what we are ought to all
[15:42] be
[15:44] you know and we will all be right you
[15:46] know and righteousness comes down to the
[15:48] word our state or fact
[15:50] of being right
[15:53] justification shots off you past sins
[15:56] you'll never have to pay for that
[16:00] because it's it's gone
[16:03] it's been cut off we see then if we can
[16:06] ever believe
[16:07] that by the new birth
[16:13] that that new birth in you is just as
[16:16] righteous
[16:17] as god is now
[16:20] if we can believe that and put it into
[16:23] that basis
[16:24] we can understand the bible
[16:27] you know and it'll it'll help to bring
[16:29] all of these things into being
[16:31] so let's just read a while all right
[16:36] so we'll start off on number one on your
[16:38] notes believe in god
[16:41] 1952-224
[16:44] all right we'll get back to the seven
[16:45] compound names in a minute
[16:47] and just in case some of you look over
[16:49] the seven compound names
[16:50] before i get through i took them out of
[16:52] the order they were in
[16:54] and put them in the order i wanted them
[16:57] okay
[16:58] because i want to preach the message
[17:00] from it in the order i want to preach it
[17:02] so if you go look it up on the computer
[17:04] you're going to find they're
[17:06] in different order but you'll find out
[17:09] what i'm talking about
[17:11] when we get to it now watch what brother
[17:14] ryan says paragraph 169
[17:17] i said do you believe the seven
[17:19] redemptive names
[17:21] compound names belong to jesus
[17:27] if he wasn't and didn't fulfill
[17:32] and in him was them seven compound names
[17:38] now watch it if he wasn't
[17:42] and didn't fulfill
[17:46] do you think he's stumbling along no
[17:48] he's just exactly right
[17:49] and in him was them seven compound names
[17:54] he wasn't jehovah java
[17:59] if he didn't fulfill all of those things
[18:03] now you're listening he wasn't jehovah
[18:05] jireh
[18:07] there is jehovah genre god's provided
[18:10] sacrifice
[18:11] and you'll have to admit that
[18:15] or say he wasn't the son of god
[18:22] amen if you don't believe that he's
[18:26] jehovah jireh the lord's provided
[18:28] sacrifice
[18:30] then you don't believe him to be the son
[18:32] of god now you're reading brother adam
[18:39] then if he is jehovah jireh
[18:43] he's jealous rafa the healer also
[18:47] for all seven compound names
[18:50] our victory our banner our shield our
[18:53] buckler our healing
[18:55] our salvation our provided sacrifice all
[18:59] laid in him and when he died at calvary
[19:02] his four principalities raised up
[19:05] wrote his hands up said it's finished
[19:07] hallelujah devils trembled hell
[19:09] shook the went went every way
[19:12] and he rose up on easter morning
[19:16] i am he that was dead and is alive again
[19:19] there he is jehovah raphae
[19:23] manasseh you think that may be wrong but
[19:26] the jehovah manasseh
[19:27] is not even listed in or how you
[19:29] pronounce it right there you may
[19:31] n a s e h uh that's not listed among
[19:35] your seven compound names on what you're
[19:37] getting out of your computer if you run
[19:38] it through
[19:39] you know or even scofield but that is
[19:41] what was
[19:42] that was where that uh jacob named
[19:46] his son manasseh
[19:52] and you know read that see and you'll
[19:54] find out that those were there see
[19:56] jehovah jehovah god's provided sacrifice
[20:00] couldn't have a word to say whether we
[20:02] talk about the people it was arguing
[20:03] about
[20:04] listen to what he said god has a
[20:06] provided way
[20:10] 540404
[20:15] now if i speak the truth that god
[20:19] provided a sacrifice
[20:22] and that sacrifice jehovah jireh
[20:26] was jesus christ and all the seven
[20:29] compound redemptive names
[20:32] laid in jesus christ
[20:37] jehovah jireh the lord's provided
[20:39] sacrifice jehovah rapha the lord that
[20:41] healed thy diseases
[20:43] and jehovah the banner and all the other
[20:46] seven compound names
[20:48] was all in christ
[20:51] jesus
[20:55] now all of them was in christ jesus
[20:59] or none of them was in christ jesus
[21:03] that's the point i want you to see
[21:04] before we go down to the names and
[21:06] and pick out the names throughout the
[21:08] scriptures and and things and show what
[21:10] each one related and how they would
[21:12] show to be jehovah jireh and jehovah
[21:15] kissing you and the things
[21:17] i want you to hear what your prophet is
[21:19] saying and this is just a small amount
[21:22] of the things that he said on these
[21:24] things i would suggest we did the other
[21:26] night we listened to
[21:28] the seven compound names of jehovah
[21:30] they're in 55
[21:31] and then we turned around and listened
[21:33] to the one in 64
[21:35] and it would be good if you went back
[21:37] and listened to those
[21:38] services about the seven compound names
[21:41] of jehovah
[21:43] all right now watch this one seven
[21:45] compound names with your whole 55
[21:47] 120 or you have 120
[21:50] 1955. now here we want to
[21:55] to make our quotation
[21:59] now he's going to make a quotation
[22:06] now i've written on the end phillip here
[22:08] that i carried
[22:10] the seven compound names of jehovah
[22:15] in other words
[22:19] it was what jehovah is
[22:26] is made up in these seven redemptive
[22:28] names
[22:29] of his
[22:33] it's what jehovah is
[22:37] see i like to underline them little
[22:38] things and think about him about them
[22:40] because you just read over it you know
[22:42] if that which always is made i mean
[22:44] seven times everyday
[22:45] no i go real slow when i'm looking on
[22:49] something because i want to digest it
[22:52] i think that's what brother dick calls
[22:54] it you know
[22:57] now god listen
[23:00] his attitude towards the people
[23:03] from eden now what was god's attitude
[23:08] toward the people from eden
[23:13] to reveal himself to the man
[23:18] that he had created
[23:22] to display all of his we'll get to it in
[23:24] a minute
[23:26] all of his attributes
[23:30] now that's what he wanted to do to man
[23:34] hmm now god is attitude towards the
[23:38] people from eden
[23:40] back to eden is wrapped in these seven
[23:42] redemptive names
[23:45] his attitude all the way through theirs
[23:47] in those seven names
[23:48] the first one being jehovah jireh which
[23:51] means
[23:52] the lord will provide a sacrifice the
[23:54] second one is jehovah rapha the lord
[23:56] the healer manasseh our banner shalom
[24:00] our peace broke high that's another one
[24:03] that's in there
[24:04] you know is shepherd our righteousness
[24:08] and sham the lord is present
[24:11] now you'll notice something right here
[24:14] and that's why i ask you to go
[24:16] listen to this message in 1955
[24:21] listen to it with this point in mind
[24:24] what was your prophet talking about
[24:32] this is what i ask you to go listen to
[24:33] the tape
[24:35] with that thought in mind what was he
[24:38] talking about
[24:39] what what did he want to get across he
[24:41] tells you right here
[24:44] remember he said now this is our
[24:46] quotation now the lord
[24:49] shaman s-a-m-m-a-h okay somebody
[24:53] you know my pronunciation is not too
[24:55] good and i'm sorry
[24:57] jamal is the one i'm going to speak on
[25:01] from this psalm 64.
[25:04] now that will be the last one of the
[25:06] seven compound names that we will speak
[25:08] on
[25:11] but i want you to listen to that tape
[25:13] with the thought in mind
[25:15] i'm going to speak from psalm 64.
[25:18] in jehovah jairus first one and this is
[25:21] the last one
[25:22] jehovah jireh is the lord will provide a
[25:25] sacrifice
[25:26] jehovah shaman is jehovah is present
[25:31] now they the lord has blessings as we
[25:32] speak so listen i would ask you just
[25:35] listen to the tape
[25:37] with the thought in mind that he's
[25:39] speaking about
[25:40] the presence
[25:44] he's not talking about jehovah jireh
[25:46] jehovah rapha jehovah this can you do
[25:49] he's talking about his presence
[25:52] and it might help you to understand what
[25:53] i've been doing job ajara 1958 127.
[25:59] and i'd like for a subject jehovah jireh
[26:02] may he had his blessing to the word
[26:04] now we're going to take our time so that
[26:05] we'll be sure to get it
[26:07] god appeared to people in seven
[26:09] redemptive names
[26:12] that's his attributes
[26:15] to his people
[26:18] now if you want to know the attributes
[26:20] what are the attributes of god father
[26:22] son holy ghost redeemer savior healer
[26:24] etc
[26:25] they're all in the seven compound names
[26:30] but that's why i'm using the last one
[26:33] will be the
[26:34] jehovah shema
[26:38] because we're not dealing with that
[26:41] in our thinking we're only dealing with
[26:44] present tense time
[26:46] our things and we only talk about what's
[26:48] being done here
[26:50] instead of him being here okay that'll
[26:52] give you the point
[26:54] now i want to take our time so that
[26:56] you'll be sure to get it
[26:57] god appeared to people in seven
[27:00] redemptive names
[27:02] that's his attributes to his people
[27:05] seven compound redemptive names
[27:08] jehovah jairo was one jehovah arafah
[27:10] maybe get on that tomorrow night
[27:12] is 2 in jehovah manassas the shield and
[27:16] on down
[27:17] 7 redemptive names and you cannot
[27:20] separate those
[27:24] names
[27:28] why because if he's one he's the other
[27:32] you can't separate it all right he said
[27:35] why don't we believe that okay
[27:37] it's good to remind us
[27:40] faithful abraham 1959 424-8
[27:45] now may he had his blessing to the
[27:46] reading of the word jehovah jireh
[27:48] now jehovah jireh means the lord will
[27:51] provide himself a sacrifice
[27:53] you remember that back there it wasn't
[27:56] that jehovah
[27:58] was going to just provide a sacrifice
[28:01] for abraham
[28:04] he had one the one that god told him to
[28:08] sacrifice
[28:12] right see where we'll get to this time
[28:15] he had one but
[28:19] the lord will provide himself
[28:25] okay we'll get to those
[28:36] jehovah john remains the lord's
[28:37] providing seven compound names
[28:39] so forth or back on number five
[28:45] okay
[28:49] jehovah raphael the healer and so forth
[28:52] jehovah our buckler
[28:54] job our shield and jehovah peace and all
[28:57] of those names
[28:58] are inseparable and watching
[29:01] that is the the nature of jehovah
[29:04] that he appears in
[29:12] that is the the nature we're on number
[29:15] five e7 i guess i might have jumped over
[29:17] one but
[29:18] faithful abraham 59 424 make sure
[29:21] everybody know what mean
[29:24] all those names are inseparable that is
[29:27] the the nature of jehovah that he
[29:29] appears in
[29:30] that's his nature jehovah jireh the lord
[29:33] will provide for himself a sacrifice
[29:36] jehovah raphael the lord that healed all
[29:38] of our diseases
[29:40] now if he isn't jehovah rafael anymore
[29:45] and what's him if he's not a healer
[29:47] anymore
[29:49] he also isn't jehovah genre
[29:52] anymore so he's not a sacrifice
[29:56] and he if he isn't jehovah jireh then
[30:00] there's no sacrifice for you and you're
[30:02] you're in your sins and if he is jehovah
[30:06] jireh the lord's provided sacrifice
[30:09] jesus christ then he's also jehovah
[30:12] raphae the lord the healer
[30:14] you can't you cannot separate god's
[30:17] nature see
[30:18] his compound redemptive names
[30:24] that's his nature
[30:28] that's his attributes
[30:32] that's his person
[30:35] is in those seven compound nines
[30:38] well all i need to know about is jesus
[30:41] well
[30:42] why are you rejecting the others
[30:47] i mean why what you know
[30:51] my brother told me one time i don't care
[30:54] how i get to heaven as long as i get
[30:55] there
[30:57] well i'd like to know a little bit about
[30:59] getting himself
[31:04] preaching 1961-26 i want to take that
[31:08] one name of jehovah george
[31:09] jiren god has a seven compound
[31:12] redemptive names
[31:14] jehovah jireh the lord will provide for
[31:17] himself a sacrifice
[31:19] jehovah rapha the lord that healeth thee
[31:20] and behold nasus
[31:23] and so forth our shield our banner and
[31:26] those names are
[31:27] inseparable if he's jehovah jireh
[31:32] then he's jehovah rapha also see and so
[31:35] you cannot separate those redemptive
[31:37] names
[31:40] and if jehovah raphae you know the
[31:42] healer
[31:43] wasn't applied to jesus
[31:47] neither was it a jehovah gyra
[31:50] applied to him now
[31:53] see you wouldn't think
[31:56] but if you believe that jesus wouldn't
[32:00] gone to the river jordan
[32:03] he would not have anything to do with
[32:05] the redemptive names of jehovah
[32:09] amen he would have read it have to do
[32:12] with redemptive names
[32:14] of jesus a man
[32:18] it wouldn't be the seven compound names
[32:20] of jehovah it'd be the seven compound
[32:22] names of
[32:23] jesus you understand what i'm saying
[32:28] if you're just making him a man
[32:34] what and if jehovah raphae wasn't
[32:37] applied to jesus neither was it a
[32:41] jehovah jehovah applied to him
[32:44] so if he's not the healer he's not the
[32:46] savior
[32:48] and if he's the savior he's also the
[32:50] healer
[32:51] and it's a finished work
[32:56] man sent me a big old book from india
[32:59] i immediately looked through and saw the
[33:01] boy had all this great build up of
[33:03] brother branham but i knew how to keep
[33:04] reading
[33:05] and while he said brother branham didn't
[33:08] have the message of redemption
[33:11] said cause he died it's a demand that's
[33:14] going to be malachi 4
[33:16] that's going to have the message of
[33:18] redemption it's got to be alive when the
[33:20] change comes
[33:22] because that would be the redemption
[33:24] well then i turned over and looked at
[33:26] the pictures of him
[33:27] and he's getting a pretty good bit of
[33:29] age so things better hurry up
[33:32] you know i'm not making fun of him
[33:35] i'm just saying that you know
[33:41] all right job of jaira 1964
[33:44] 403. now god has seven redemptive names
[33:49] we know that and you cannot separate
[33:53] them from christ
[33:55] you can't separate them christ met
[33:58] every one of those compound redemptive
[34:00] names you believe that
[34:03] he you believe he's jehovah jireh the
[34:06] lord's provided sacrifice
[34:08] then what about jehovah rapha the lord
[34:10] healed all of thy diseases
[34:13] if that wasn't applied to christ then he
[34:16] wasn't jehovah genre
[34:18] so you can't separate it the whole
[34:20] thing's wound up and there you are
[34:23] he can't be jehovah jairo without being
[34:25] jehovah
[34:26] jehovah rafa without being jeweled with
[34:28] jiren neither can he beat jehovah jairo
[34:30] without being jehovah rapha
[34:32] he was wounded for our transmission when
[34:34] his strikes were healed
[34:35] no argument he says about it
[34:44] jehovah would join 1955 817
[34:48] now i wish to continue my text it was
[34:52] found in genesis 22 and 14
[34:54] and this text was jehovah jireh
[34:58] now god has seven redemptive names now
[35:01] in these compound ridiculous names
[35:03] it was god expressing his present
[35:07] attitude for all his creatures
[35:14] are you reading it it's what now
[35:18] is god expressing his present attitude
[35:22] for all of his creatures what it would
[35:25] be
[35:25] for them in all generations
[35:29] you cannot separate his compound name
[35:32] now
[35:32] this is paragraph or e5 read e6 and e7
[35:36] is all in the same thing okay
[35:39] so now in washington dc now watch this
[35:42] example
[35:45] in washington dc uh my name is recorded
[35:50] it makes me that what what nationality i
[35:53] am
[35:54] who my father and mother was how much i
[35:57] weighed when i was born
[35:59] my description my prince of my thumb
[36:02] you see it's the expression to the
[36:04] nation
[36:05] who i am and william branham
[36:09] is is recorded up there in washington
[36:13] that's my the expression of me to the
[36:16] nation
[36:18] now that is my name so when god came
[36:21] down from heaven to be king over the
[36:23] earth
[36:25] he expressed himself to his subjects and
[36:27] seven redemptive names
[36:29] jehovah jireh was his first name it
[36:31] means god will provide
[36:32] for himself a sacrifice the next
[36:36] compound redemptive name is jehovah
[36:38] rapha
[36:38] means i am the lord that healeth thee
[36:41] and only he goes as jehovah our banner
[36:44] our peace
[36:45] our shield our righteousness that's what
[36:48] he is to us
[36:50] so we can't separate those names
[36:54] if he's still jehovah jairo
[36:57] he has to be jehovah rapha also if he's
[37:00] our provided sacrifice
[37:02] he has to be our healer also so the
[37:05] names are inseparable
[37:08] when we accept him as savior
[37:12] we must also accept him as healer
[37:19] as our peace as our shield
[37:23] as our banner all of these redemptive
[37:26] names god's present
[37:27] attitude is to his people
[37:30] now the same
[37:34] now when we accept him as savior
[37:40] we must also accept him as healer
[37:46] but i'm asking you and me a question
[37:51] do we accept him as healer
[37:55] the way we accept him as savior
[38:06] i'm serious asking a question
[38:10] do we accept him as our healer the way
[38:13] we accept him as our savior
[38:20] now we try to explain about healing
[38:24] because we're quick to quote that we can
[38:27] be
[38:27] healed or something and die the same
[38:30] thing the next day
[38:35] but what are we doing
[38:43] if he's our savior
[38:48] now where's your savior at i don't
[38:52] i'm trying to get on his name now i
[38:54] gotta get away from that in a minute
[38:55] because i don't know i'll get hung up on
[38:58] but just let me say that where's your
[39:00] savior
[39:07] well he's sitting up in heaven on the
[39:09] throne
[39:12] where's your savior
[39:16] he's inside of you right
[39:19] all right so where's your healer same
[39:22] place
[39:25] that's right no no no no brother
[39:28] healing healing is on a different basis
[39:30] you see there now you explain that away
[39:35] so you've proven that your healer and
[39:37] your savior is not the same
[39:43] so you're trying to justify something
[39:49] instead of just facing it out front
[39:55] but we won't die take the same example
[39:59] on the
[39:59] healing and apply it to our salvation
[40:09] he said yeah well i i'm i'm sick for the
[40:12] glory of the lord
[40:16] i like the way brother moak said it it's
[40:18] a good point
[40:21] did you say well i've got a leg off for
[40:23] the glory of the lord
[40:26] well why don't you cut the other one off
[40:30] and give him double glory
[40:35] is that any problem are you being
[40:37] sarcastic no i'm not you're the one
[40:39] that's
[40:40] sarcastic because you're not thinking
[40:41] about what i'm saying
[40:48] do we take our healer the same way we
[40:50] take our savior
[40:52] all right i'll back off of that because
[40:55] i want to get back to it
[41:03] so what do we end up saying when we
[41:05] accept him as savior
[41:07] we must accept him as healer as our
[41:10] peace our shield
[41:12] as our banner all these redemptive names
[41:15] god's present attitude to his people now
[41:20] the same
[41:23] e6 time of decision 1959 418
[41:28] he's talking about coming down the round
[41:29] the offering up on the mountain
[41:32] and things because he's jehovah jireh
[41:35] the lord will provide himself a
[41:37] sacrifice
[41:39] and he's just as much jehovah jireh
[41:41] tonight
[41:43] as he was then
[41:47] and if he's jehovah jireh
[41:50] he's jehovah rapha also another
[41:53] redemptive name
[41:54] which is jehovah the healer
[41:58] the names are the compound names of
[42:00] jehovah and they are
[42:02] absolutely inseparable
[42:08] he's jehovah shield jehovah butler
[42:11] butler jehovah our banner
[42:15] jehovah healer drove our sacrifice
[42:18] and you cannot accept those names for
[42:21] if he ceases to be jehovah rapha
[42:25] then he's not jehovah jireh and if he's
[42:28] still jehovah jireh
[42:30] he's still jehovah rapha both savior
[42:33] and healer
[42:39] now i'll get back to this
[42:42] so i've said to you keep these notes
[42:47] look at him when he gets on the jehovah
[42:48] gyra i'm excuse me
[42:50] seven combat names in jehovah 1955
[42:56] 120.
[42:59] remember he's talking about the presence
[43:01] of the lord
[43:05] remember what i said a while ago did you
[43:07] write that down
[43:09] in the seven compound names with
[43:11] jehovah's message he's speaking about
[43:13] jehovah
[43:14] jeremiah
[43:23] now the lord is our refuge and strength
[43:27] the very present help in the name of
[43:29] trouble in
[43:30] time of truth and in the redemptive
[43:34] names s-h-a-m-m-a-h
[43:39] jamal the lord is present
[43:44] now jehovah jireh will provide
[43:48] jehovah the provider is present
[43:52] you get what i mean
[43:56] if he is the lord's provided sacrifice
[44:02] then he's got to be the lord god present
[44:05] in the time of trouble a time of hell
[44:08] need
[44:09] see what i mean did you read that
[44:15] if he's the lord provided sacrifice he's
[44:17] got to be the lord god
[44:18] present in the time of hell
[44:24] i believe that's the worst problem that
[44:25] we all have me
[44:28] all the way to the back right and
[44:30] anybody down in the basement anybody
[44:32] else
[44:33] listening to these tapes or listening to
[44:34] them does it go out on the internet
[44:36] i believe that's our problem we don't
[44:38] recognize him as being present
[44:44] we recognize him as coming on his way
[44:47] a journey yeah we don't recognize him as
[44:50] being president
[44:53] where's your savior what was the
[44:54] question logo where's your savior
[44:58] in your soul where's your healer
[45:02] right
[45:10] now if he is here tonight to save
[45:12] anybody from sin
[45:17] listen
[45:21] he's got to be present tonight to
[45:23] fulfill the rest of those redemptive
[45:26] names right you see why he was preaching
[45:30] on
[45:31] joel
[45:38] sacrifice our healer our banner our
[45:40] peace our shepherd our righteousness
[45:43] and his presence he's got to be
[45:46] all that right now in the last thing
[45:52] at the last one of his redemptive names
[45:55] that he appeared to abraham he said
[45:59] i'm jehovah raphae the provided one for
[46:02] to produce a sacrifice
[46:04] provide the way whatever it is god will
[46:06] provide it
[46:08] i am jehovah that healeth thee
[46:11] i am thy righteousness what was he
[46:13] saying to abraham
[46:16] i am thy peace i am thy shield
[46:20] i am thy banner and i'm ever present
[46:25] to perform it
[46:29] amen you see what i mean never present
[46:31] to perform it
[46:33] i the lord has spoken
[46:36] now the lord hath planted i see it i'll
[46:38] water it day and night let some pluck it
[46:41] from my hand
[46:42] yeah now i'll tell you something that
[46:46] he's done in that
[46:47] because he goes on to tell the story
[46:51] he was out hunting which was really his
[46:54] honeymoon with his wife and
[46:56] billy paul you remember he left them and
[46:59] went up on the mountain to hunt
[47:02] and he told him to stay there he got up
[47:05] on the mountain
[47:07] and he killed a deer
[47:13] and he got lost
[47:19] you remember the story he thought he was
[47:22] a god and he kept running around and
[47:23] round around and come right back to the
[47:24] same place
[47:25] and didn't death walk
[47:29] he thought i can't be he said i never
[47:31] cured a compass
[47:33] he said you know he was too good of a
[47:36] guy
[47:40] he said if it wasn't for my wife and my
[47:42] boy down there i'd just crawl up in one
[47:44] of these caves or
[47:45] a hole here and
[47:48] i never have understood what he said
[47:50] about that because i didn't know where
[47:51] you could eat them but he said
[47:52] i just eat some pine cones and wait it
[47:55] out for a few days
[47:57] said then i'd climb up on the mountain
[47:59] somewhere and i'd get my directions and
[48:01] walk them out
[48:04] he said but my wife and boy was down
[48:06] there and said they couldn't survive
[48:08] said it'd be well into zero tonight and
[48:10] said they didn't know how to survive
[48:14] so he kept running around and around
[48:16] trying to convince himself
[48:18] that he wasn't lost
[48:21] that's it but finally he had to come to
[48:24] realize
[48:25] right and the lord kept telling him i'm
[48:28] a present help
[48:29] in a time of trouble he kept speaking
[48:33] louder and louder to it and he said well
[48:35] lord and he turned around and he said
[48:37] well this has got to be it i'm going the
[48:38] right way
[48:41] you remember he come to find out he's
[48:42] heading to canada right on straight up
[48:44] from where they're going
[48:46] he said the fog pulled back and he
[48:48] looked over and saw this mountain
[48:50] you know whatever it was there and he
[48:51] said he knew he was going wrong
[48:53] but he still couldn't find his way
[48:54] remember he finally found the
[48:56] the line that they had put in to run the
[48:58] telephone line up to the
[49:00] to the place he found his way out
[49:04] but he said that voice kept saying i'm
[49:07] an ever present help
[49:09] in a time of trouble
[49:13] but you see church we don't put our
[49:16] whole thing
[49:17] on the thinking of
[49:22] how that if one part of his name applies
[49:27] then the other part has to apply with
[49:29] equal
[49:33] status every how you say it
[49:37] equal amount
[49:40] is he a big god as jehovah jireh
[49:45] and a smaller one as banner banner
[49:51] is he greater on one thing than on the
[49:56] other
[50:00] what are we believing to be
[50:05] do you realize that see that's what i've
[50:08] tried my best to get you to see about
[50:09] the presence of the lord
[50:11] because many many many years ago
[50:14] probably close to 30.
[50:17] i told you then i said i'm not talking
[50:19] about the coming of the lord
[50:20] somewhere else i'm not concerned about
[50:23] going there i'm concerned about getting
[50:24] god here
[50:27] that's what i've been trying to do
[50:31] but do we put equal quality upon each
[50:35] redemptive name
[50:39] do we value them all as the sign
[50:44] or do we put one above the other
[50:49] when we do we make him not to be hebrews
[50:52] 13
[50:52] 8.
[50:58] because if he's the lord our sacrifice
[51:06] why can't we believe him to be the lord
[51:07] or healer
[51:15] and brother i truly believe i i just
[51:18] believe
[51:19] and there is just nothing in the world
[51:22] that you can
[51:24] do to try to talk me out of the fact
[51:26] that i'm saved
[51:29] what are you doing trying to prop
[51:30] yourself up you trying to convince me
[51:34] who are you trying to convince amen
[51:38] come on yeah
[51:41] i know i don't preach like other
[51:43] preachers i'm not that great
[51:44] robust to get you to look at jehovah
[51:46] jaira jehovah rafa
[51:47] and you're just as righteous but
[51:51] if we leave any one of those
[51:54] names and make it of lesser value
[52:02] how can it be god that is being revealed
[52:09] and are we looking at it like our banner
[52:13] we'll get to that one
[52:17] that well
[52:20] i ain't been doing pretty too good but
[52:22] maybe the lord come on the scene
[52:25] and be my banner be my help
[52:30] now you think god had to come on the
[52:32] scene to the prophet
[52:36] turn the mountain
[52:40] or was god already there
[52:50] god already knew what he was going to do
[52:52] for abraham
[52:54] when he got there
[52:58] what are we thinking about it well
[53:04] brother dale i i i she's my my savior
[53:09] and i just can't believe from a healing
[53:14] why not
[53:21] maybe we're proving by our lives of the
[53:23] fact that we can't believe certain
[53:25] things
[53:26] that we don't believe other things
[53:36] is that ring of bell we
[53:43] we can see him as our savior
[53:47] but then we have to look somewhere way
[53:48] off or some if brother branham would
[53:50] just come back
[53:54] and tell us with healed
[54:03] so now then you'd have to say if brother
[54:04] brown would come back and
[54:06] tell us we're saved
[54:12] turn off on nobody what you believe is
[54:14] your business
[54:15] i'm just trying to preach the truth
[54:22] do we have god in degrees as the seven
[54:25] compound names
[54:30] do we put him to be bigger in one form
[54:33] than he is in another form
[54:41] can we say that by the new birth
[54:47] my soul is just as righteous as god is
[54:54] and really believe that
[55:00] can we believe it
[55:06] what a problem
[55:10] but yet we said we don't have no trouble
[55:11] believing him as savior
[55:16] when brother today allowed just simple i
[55:19] just accepted him as my savior
[55:23] well did he accept you
[55:27] what your prophet said now you go argue
[55:29] with him
[55:32] he said did god accept you
[55:36] well brother dale i go to brothers
[55:37] georgios church and i just feel so
[55:39] wonderful
[55:40] and i just feel so saved and so glorious
[55:43] and i come up here and you just beat me
[55:46] down
[55:52] what have i told you anything tonight's
[55:55] not right
[56:00] how have i said anything that's not
[56:02] right
[56:04] have we not read exactly what the
[56:07] prophet you claim to believe
[56:09] has to say
[56:15] you see brother dale you're not putting
[56:16] it like to where we can
[56:18] have an opportunity to receive something
[56:20] why not
[56:26] what good is it for me to pat you on the
[56:28] back
[56:30] and you pat me on the back and then we
[56:32] wind up in the tribulation patting each
[56:34] other on the back
[56:35] right you missed the rapture
[56:39] now what good is that
[56:43] when we sure loved one another we patted
[56:46] on the back
[56:48] you know we patted right on the end of
[56:50] the tribulation
[56:52] and if we're in a tribulation we're not
[56:54] in the bride of christ
[56:57] well she doesn't know that right right
[57:00] so it's not that you turned him down as
[57:02] your healer you turned him down as your
[57:04] savior
[57:08] no no i believe him as my savior
[57:13] do you believe he's your healer the same
[57:15] way
[57:24] we don't have much problems telling
[57:26] everybody we're saved right
[57:28] right
[57:31] come on be serious
[57:34] i try to because that's what i try to
[57:36] preach because
[57:38] patting you on the back and everything
[57:40] else ain't gonna do no good
[57:44] but we we're easy to say that we're
[57:48] saved
[57:51] and brother you can't tell me i ain't
[57:53] saved
[57:54] i ain't never tried to tell nobody they
[57:56] would
[58:03] but on the same respect he's right here
[58:13] on the same respect he's our
[58:20] righteousness
[58:22] not to ex listen i know i'm i'm just
[58:25] going to quit it on that ain't going to
[58:27] go into the night
[58:28] it's not to try to to confess ourselves
[58:32] into something
[58:38] it's got to be revealed to us right
[58:40] right
[58:41] that's why the prophet said during the
[58:43] church eighth book
[58:44] page 31 he said the revelation of it is
[58:47] missing
[58:49] from the majority of the people the
[58:52] revelation of what
[58:53] that they're not as righteous as god is
[58:58] so big believing that you're not as
[59:01] righteous as god is
[59:03] you're rejecting that you're saved
[59:11] because see you're looking out here
[59:13] right
[59:16] you're not looking at the inward man
[59:22] you're not looking at the new birth
[59:25] you're still not nicodemus you mean i
[59:27] gotta go back to my mother's womb
[59:28] you may not gotta go start doing better
[59:30] you mean i gotta quit this
[59:32] i gotta quit that i gotta go do this i
[59:34] gotta go do that
[59:46] reject one is to reject the other
[59:52] to accept one is to accept the other
[1:00:00] we've got to realize folks
[1:00:04] that the confessing of our mouth is one
[1:00:07] thing
[1:00:10] but a believing in our heart is
[1:00:12] connected to
[1:00:14] salvation or is not right
[1:00:20] see so we believe in our heart
[1:00:24] the correct thing and then when he
[1:00:26] confessed the correct thing
[1:00:30] then god has to honor his word
[1:00:37] but we're not going to be here
[1:00:41] that's why i changed the order of the
[1:00:43] thing of bread around the hole he said
[1:00:45] first it's job ajirah lord's provided
[1:00:47] sacrifice second is always jehovah
[1:00:50] or healer because that's what he was
[1:00:51] dealing with out in the public
[1:00:54] right and i changed the order of that
[1:00:55] because
[1:00:58] i believe if we don't understand the
[1:01:00] order
[1:01:02] we will never understand what is being
[1:01:05] said
[1:01:06] so look at the order of it and just make
[1:01:08] sure you bring this back
[1:01:12] look at the order of how that i brought
[1:01:14] them
[1:01:15] and divided them up
[1:01:20] but it's not a walk through our life and
[1:01:23] we got him as jehovah
[1:01:25] jireh and then we walk a little more and
[1:01:27] we gotta get your whole area
[1:01:30] and then when we walk a little further
[1:01:32] we get him with jehovah this canoe
[1:01:34] and then we get him as jova gray fine
[1:01:37] then we
[1:01:43] walking by revelation yes but not
[1:01:46] trying to walk into the things
[1:01:50] we're not going to walk in to make him a
[1:01:53] healer
[1:01:58] that's where our trouble is
[1:02:02] now i didn't say it so you can't argue
[1:02:04] with me
[1:02:05] your prophet said true genuine
[1:02:08] christians
[1:02:11] come across the platform
[1:02:15] and not get healed
[1:02:19] and he said sinners
[1:02:26] come across and be healed
[1:02:29] now what's the problem
[1:02:34] must be something that we're trying to
[1:02:36] figure out
[1:02:40] because you know what i like about it
[1:02:42] i'm talking about me as well as you
[1:02:44] because see i get it then
[1:02:45] come preach it to you
[1:02:49] brother brown said the first person
[1:02:55] that was ever saved
[1:02:58] he said was saved by the blood
[1:03:02] all right so now we'd automatically go
[1:03:04] over
[1:03:05] able right
[1:03:09] the first one that was saved by the
[1:03:11] blood because he offered
[1:03:17] and he said if anybody ever reaches that
[1:03:20] place
[1:03:22] god will have to save them
[1:03:27] or he acted wrong the first time
[1:03:33] now my quote brother branham
[1:03:38] he said if anybody
[1:03:42] was ever healed
[1:03:45] anywhere
[1:03:51] you'd automatically know that they were
[1:03:52] an old testament person right
[1:03:55] and not have the new birth
[1:03:59] right
[1:04:04] he said the first person was ever healed
[1:04:09] he said if you ever reach that place
[1:04:10] you'll be healed too
[1:04:15] and you see that's what that prostitute
[1:04:18] or whatever across the platform
[1:04:23] they reached that place at the first
[1:04:25] person
[1:04:27] was healed
[1:04:31] now brother is different now show me
[1:04:34] all right bring you the prime of the
[1:04:36] prophet's message and show me
[1:04:41] he said if anybody was ever healed and
[1:04:44] you ever reach that place god's
[1:04:45] obligated to heal you
[1:04:47] or he acted wrong the first time now am
[1:04:49] i saying what he said
[1:04:53] yeah but you don't understand my case
[1:04:55] that's where the problem is
[1:04:58] god don't have a case
[1:05:02] he's got his word we the ones got cases
[1:05:10] like i said if brother branham would
[1:05:12] come back and lay his hands on us
[1:05:18] now he run around and lay his hands on
[1:05:20] the first person that got healed
[1:05:21] no
[1:05:24] did abraham do
[1:05:28] anybody want a name
[1:05:34] there's no record of who the first
[1:05:37] person was healed
[1:05:38] as far as i know of in the bible
[1:05:46] what do you understand there must be
[1:05:49] something wrong
[1:05:52] the revelation is what's lacking right
[1:05:56] right
[1:06:01] did we make it something that it's not
[1:06:06] i've had people to make fun of me you
[1:06:08] know maybe
[1:06:10] not meaning wrong way but say brother
[1:06:13] you just believe what people say
[1:06:16] well now that's a pretty good start in
[1:06:19] the right direction
[1:06:23] you know what
[1:06:27] because if you don't believe what people
[1:06:29] say
[1:06:30] you get a problem
[1:06:34] yeah you just believe what anybody says
[1:06:37] yeah
[1:06:39] wade comes up and tells me he's seen a
[1:06:42] pink alpha
[1:06:44] you know wait ain't no pink elephants
[1:06:52] some of you dropped seen them
[1:07:00] and you know today they have pink
[1:07:02] elephants
[1:07:04] because they paint them
[1:07:10] you know like the prophet said it's hard
[1:07:12] to get one person to believe another
[1:07:18] you know what's the biggest disgrace
[1:07:20] that i can think of
[1:07:22] about a christian to have to do in the
[1:07:24] world today
[1:07:28] is to swear to tell the truth
[1:07:31] right amen that's the biggest disgrace
[1:07:34] to christianity
[1:07:36] i could ever think of is to swear to
[1:07:39] tell the truth
[1:07:42] hey brother colleen come tell me
[1:07:44] something i said
[1:07:46] brother colleen would would you swear
[1:07:49] about that
[1:07:53] you know what i mean i don't believe him
[1:07:57] so how's that i don't believe him
[1:08:04] what is it then what's our problem
[1:08:08] our problem is just what i've tried to
[1:08:10] say
[1:08:12] we put our salvation in this line over
[1:08:15] here
[1:08:17] that is seemingly an easy way to go that
[1:08:20] we confess and we
[1:08:21] we keep confessing
[1:08:25] and we won't die or take anything in
[1:08:26] contrary
[1:08:32] but yet we put our healing off onto
[1:08:35] something else in some other way
[1:08:37] how can we do that when he's the same
[1:08:43] what's the difference
[1:08:48] you never talk to a good bad distance
[1:08:51] not a
[1:08:51] trinitarian trinitarian because the
[1:08:54] baptist believed in god in three persons
[1:08:55] but
[1:08:57] you know the blessed trinity but you
[1:08:58] ever talk to one
[1:09:01] and they say if i deny the father
[1:09:05] i've denied the son if i deny the father
[1:09:09] or the son
[1:09:10] i'm lost so i gotta have the three
[1:09:19] a good catholic goes up with their their
[1:09:21] things and
[1:09:22] just trying to get mary involved in it
[1:09:24] and we laugh and make fun of them
[1:09:28] oh my god but what about it right
[1:09:33] we want to blame everybody else for the
[1:09:35] fact that we're sick tonight
[1:09:43] instead of accepting our own south and
[1:09:44] where we're at
[1:09:48] when i brought brother down hold on a
[1:09:50] minute now now
[1:09:51] john was righteous perfect and god put
[1:09:53] him through a bit of that
[1:09:56] do you know that god is putting you
[1:09:59] through
[1:10:01] the things you're going through
[1:10:07] do you has he told you
[1:10:13] well then how do you know
[1:10:17] but get the point just using java jar
[1:10:19] and joe horace
[1:10:21] but i hope you hold that form in your
[1:10:23] mind of thinking
[1:10:24] that if we make one of these compound
[1:10:27] name
[1:10:27] to be over here that's easily reached
[1:10:30] this was a little harder
[1:10:31] and this one's a little harder or this
[1:10:33] one's a little easier and this is
[1:10:36] what are we doing right
[1:10:41] we're certainly not believing hebrews 13
[1:10:43] 8
[1:10:49] do you see if he's your savior he's your
[1:10:50] healer
[1:10:54] did the anything extra happen at calvary
[1:10:57] now don't get ahead of me quote mine's
[1:10:59] okay
[1:11:00] did anything extra happen at calvary
[1:11:04] to heal you
[1:11:09] and he said what but no no don't wait he
[1:11:11] was striped
[1:11:12] okay that's fine
[1:11:17] but do you believe the striping of the
[1:11:19] lord jesus christ
[1:11:22] without the death of calvary
[1:11:27] would have healed anybody
[1:11:35] simple question give me a simple answer
[1:11:42] had he not died on the cross
[1:11:47] would the stripes done any good
[1:11:52] come on folks it's faith in the blood
[1:11:55] that heals you
[1:11:56] it's not the blood that splatters on you
[1:12:00] it's faith in the blood
[1:12:04] it's faith in the life that was in the
[1:12:06] blood
[1:12:09] that's why god didn't have no problem
[1:12:11] putting it together
[1:12:13] he's wounded for our transgression
[1:12:15] bruised for our iniquity
[1:12:17] with his strife we are healed he put it
[1:12:20] all together
[1:12:23] but is there any healing apart from
[1:12:25] calvary
[1:12:31] no because he's jaw vagina
[1:12:35] and if he's jehovah gyra he's jehovah
[1:12:38] rapha
[1:12:41] if he's your rafa he's jehovah this can
[1:12:44] you
[1:12:47] if he's all of that then he's jehovah's
[1:12:50] your mom
[1:12:53] which means he's present right right
[1:13:01] that wrong last night as i listened in
[1:13:02] the prophet where it kept ringing in his
[1:13:05] ears and saying
[1:13:08] i'm the ever present god
[1:13:12] right in the ever present god
[1:13:20] why would we be afraid
[1:13:23] if we believe god is with us right well
[1:13:27] now in a way
[1:13:29] that's a problem you know why not
[1:13:32] brother dale you could say that george
[1:13:33] iron jarvis
[1:13:35] is the same you know okay
[1:13:39] but you get this before we finish it
[1:13:43] had he not died on the cross he wouldn't
[1:13:45] be our banner
[1:13:48] he wouldn't be our righteousness he
[1:13:51] wouldn't be our shield
[1:13:54] he wouldn't be our shepherd
[1:14:01] there's two of those compound names
[1:14:06] that are not written out in the
[1:14:07] scriptures
[1:14:12] the lord is our shepherd
[1:14:16] that's his name but there's not a
[1:14:19] jehovah
[1:14:21] rayah didn't there
[1:14:30] so if you look at it look down through
[1:14:32] there you'll find a couple of them that
[1:14:34] have no place
[1:14:35] other than what we place upon it
[1:14:38] because we must see now i asked you to
[1:14:41] do this
[1:14:44] i was running through some references on
[1:14:46] the computer and checking what other
[1:14:48] people had to say
[1:14:50] about the seven compound names i ran
[1:14:53] across a very interesting
[1:14:56] from a man
[1:15:00] and i thought yep i want you to read
[1:15:05] the 23rd psalm all right
[1:15:08] over and over and over
[1:15:13] because all seven compound names
[1:15:16] of jehovah is applied
[1:15:21] in psalms 23.

[1:15:27] my shepherd

[1:15:34] making me to lie down he's my banner

[1:15:44] all in all

[1:16:06] value amen as to any of the other things
[1:16:12] it must be done cannot be
[1:16:16] that you accept him as one thing
