[0:54] our hearts to receive from you in this
[0:56] this day in jesus name we pray amen
[0:59] amen look at the word uh diligence this
[1:02] morning and
[1:03] proverbs 4 verse 20 says my son attend
[1:06] to my words and climb thine air under my
[1:08] sayings
[1:10] let them not depart from thine eyes keep
[1:12] them in the midst of thine heart
[1:14] for they are life unto those that find
[1:16] them and help to all their flesh
[1:18] keep thy heart with all diligence for
[1:21] out of it are the issues of life
[1:25] now the word
[1:26] diligence
[1:28] got several different definitions here
[1:30] diligence is the quality of working
[1:33] carefully and with a lot of effort
[1:35] steady earnest
[1:37] and energetic effort devoted and
[1:39] painstaking work and application to
[1:41] accomplish an undertaking
[1:43] assiduous
[1:45] the
[1:46] meaning showing great care attention and
[1:49] effort marked by careful unremitting
[1:52] attention or persistent application
[1:55] earnestness
[1:56] in accomplishing
[1:58] promoting or striving after anything to
[2:00] give all diligence
[2:02] interest oneself most earnestly
[2:07] so
[2:09] i was i was thinking
[2:11] on these
[2:12] this
[2:13] subject
[2:16] it was a quote by abraham lincoln
[2:19] and he said the
[2:20] the leading rule for a lawyer
[2:22] as for the man of every other calling is
[2:25] diligence
[2:26] he said leave nothing for tomorrow which
[2:28] can be done today
[2:31] and so i was thinking about
[2:34] giving diligence and
[2:37] proverb solomon speaking in proverbs and
[2:39] the different scriptures that mention
[2:40] this
[2:42] and here in um
[2:44] in romans
[2:46] speaking of
[2:48] abraham and paul speaking
[2:51] of abraham being justified by faith
[2:56] and it says what shall we say then after
[2:58] abraham our father as pertaining to the
[3:00] flesh hath found
[3:01] for if abraham were justified by works
[3:04] he hath whereof to glory but not before
[3:07] god for what saith the scripture abraham
[3:09] believed god and it was counted for him
[3:11] for righteousness
[3:13] now verse 11 says
[3:15] and he received a sign of circumcision
[3:17] the seal of the righteousness of the
[3:19] faith which he had yet being
[3:21] uncircumcised that he might be the
[3:23] father of all them that believe
[3:25] though they be not circumcised that
[3:27] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[3:29] also
[3:30] and the father of circumcision to them
[3:33] which are not of the circumcision only
[3:35] but also but who
[3:37] also walk in the steps of that faith
[3:41] of our father abraham which he had being
[3:44] not uncircumcised for the promise
[3:47] that he should be heir of the world was
[3:49] not to abraham or to his seed
[3:51] through the law but through the
[3:52] righteousness of faith
[3:54] so we know that
[3:56] abraham received the promise through
[3:58] faith and it was counted to him by faith
[4:02] but
[4:03] he had to
[4:07] believe
[4:08] but then his actions proved that he had
[4:10] faith
[4:11] is what james says here in in 2
[4:15] james 2 20
[4:18] and it says but thou
[4:20] thou know o vain man that faith without
[4:23] works is dead was not abraham or father
[4:25] justified by works when he had offered
[4:28] isaac his son upon the altar see us
[4:31] thou how faith wrought with his works
[4:33] and by works was faith made perfect
[4:36] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[4:38] saith abraham believed god and it was
[4:40] unputed unto him for righteousness and
[4:43] he was called the friend of god you see
[4:45] then how that by works a man is
[4:47] justified
[4:48] and not by faith only likewise also was
[4:52] not rahab the harlot justified by works
[4:54] when she received the messengers when
[4:56] she had sent them out another way
[4:59] for as the body without the spirit is
[5:01] dead so faith without works is dead also
[5:06] so we know in the scripture and
[5:08] many times people have argued and they
[5:11] see there's a contradiction there but
[5:14] understanding that
[5:16] you know god sees a man's faith and he
[5:19] imputed that as for righteousness for
[5:21] abraham because he what he saw what he
[5:23] that he would believe
[5:25] but the outside
[5:27] world what people see is our works
[5:30] because if you have faith
[5:32] as james said fakes without works is
[5:33] dead so you're gonna have to have works
[5:35] people are gonna have to see that you
[5:37] actually believe because if you
[5:40] all the way through the scripture
[5:42] you know noah received the word from the
[5:44] lord that there was gonna be
[5:46] rain
[5:47] there was no way of proving that but
[5:50] that's what noah believed
[5:52] science could prove that there was no
[5:53] water in the heavens but no one said
[5:55] it's going to rain
[5:57] god gave him that word
[5:58] it's impossibility
[6:01] but it wasn't impossible
[6:03] because god spoke it would come to pass
[6:06] and noah believed that
[6:08] so when noah believed what god was going
[6:09] to say then he put his faith in action
[6:12] and he started building a boat
[6:14] he started building the ark right that's
[6:16] right but you know
[6:18] when when you have faith
[6:22] and faith produces works
[6:25] then the other part of that
[6:27] is when you have works
[6:29] is the word where diligence comes in
[6:34] and when so when you look at
[6:36] you know we can have works
[6:39] but you know we have to follow god
[6:42] all the way
[6:44] we have to follow god the way that he
[6:46] would lead us hebrews 11 6 says but
[6:50] without faith it's impossible to please
[6:52] him
[6:53] for he that cometh to god must believe
[6:55] that he is and he is a rewarder of them
[6:58] that diligently seek him
[7:00] so
[7:01] he says diligently seek him so there's a
[7:03] way you know
[7:05] when noah was building the ark you know
[7:09] he didn't take his own idea on how to
[7:11] build it
[7:13] you know he doesn't say hey god told me
[7:15] to build an ark i'm gonna build a heart
[7:17] god gave him the exact measurements on
[7:19] how to build the ark
[7:21] he gave him the wood
[7:22] told him what kind of wood to use to
[7:24] build the ark
[7:26] he told him how to pitch it within and
[7:29] without
[7:30] how many levels to put in
[7:32] how many doors to put in how many
[7:34] windows to put in every aspect of the
[7:36] ark was built to god's design
[7:39] it wasn't noah's design
[7:42] and so when we look at the word
[7:43] diligence that's how god wants us to
[7:45] believe not just to believe that he is
[7:50] he is
[7:51] he is whatever you have need of
[7:55] he is the i am the
[7:56] ever-present but whatever you have need
[7:59] of that's what he is
[8:00] but he says he's a rewarder of them that
[8:02] diligently seek him
[8:05] and so we put all things aside
[8:10] to follow him in the way that god would
[8:12] lead us
[8:14] as as the
[8:15] there's our term
[8:17] looking
[8:18] you look and see what diligence means
[8:20] you know we hold on careful
[8:24] determination
[8:26] working
[8:28] carefully with a lot of effort
[8:31] now later on i want to i want to look at
[8:34] some
[8:35] things
[8:36] because if we if we look to see how god
[8:38] wants us to be diligent and understand
[8:40] what god wants us to do
[8:42] and
[8:43] here in ii peter
[8:46] chapter 1
[8:48] and
[8:49] peter's
[8:50] speaking of
[8:52] you know the stature of a perfect man
[8:54] and
[8:55] he says as according as his divine power
[8:57] have given unto us all things that
[8:59] pertain unto life and godliness through
[9:01] the knowledge of him that have called us
[9:04] to glory and virtue whereby our giving
[9:06] unto us exceeding great and precious
[9:08] promises that by these you might be
[9:11] partakers of the divine nature having
[9:13] escaped the corruption that is in the
[9:14] world through lust
[9:16] and he said and besides this giving all
[9:18] diligence
[9:20] so we see that god has given us his this
[9:23] divine power he's given us his nature
[9:27] he's given us these exceeding great
[9:28] promises
[9:30] and then he says besides this
[9:33] he says giving all diligence
[9:36] so there's something that has to be done
[9:38] beyond this
[9:40] he says besides giving this giving all
[9:42] diligence
[9:44] so how do we
[9:45] or to pursue these things he says then
[9:48] add to your faith
[9:51] virtue
[9:53] and to virtue knowledge into knowledge
[9:55] temperance
[9:56] and it tempers patience and the patience
[9:59] godliness and to godliness brotherly
[10:01] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[10:03] charity
[10:04] he said for if these things
[10:07] be in you and abound
[10:08] they make you that you shall
[10:11] that ye shall neither be barren nor
[10:13] unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord
[10:15] jesus christ
[10:16] but he that lack of these things is
[10:18] blind and cannot see afar off
[10:20] and hath forgotten that he is purged
[10:22] from his old sins
[10:24] wherefore the rather brethren give
[10:26] diligence to make your calling and
[10:28] election sure
[10:30] for if you do these things
[10:32] you shall never fall
[10:34] so when god calls us
[10:37] into
[10:40] when
[10:41] you receive the new birth
[10:43] as brother brown said you know
[10:45] as speaking of the the pentecostals you
[10:47] know they thought well you know
[10:49] i've reached the i've reached the
[10:51] pinnacle this is it they said let you
[10:53] know you just got started
[10:55] and you brother rebuked the pentecostals
[10:58] because he said y'all cabbage down
[11:00] on this part and not realizing there was
[11:02] something greater to come
[11:04] and so you should continue on
[11:07] and understanding paul's speaking about
[11:08] receiving these this divine promise
[11:11] this divine nature that we receive from
[11:13] god and he says besides this
[11:17] so we have received the spirit of god we
[11:19] have received the spirit of adoption but
[11:21] after you receive this he said but
[11:22] besides this
[11:24] he said give all diligence
[11:28] to to press forward
[11:30] with everything
[11:32] to make sure that we have these things
[11:35] to add to our faith continue on continue
[11:37] on press forward
[11:41] and you know
[11:42] many times when
[11:44] i was i was thinking of of this quote
[11:46] where brother branham says in be certain
[11:49] of god and you know when when you look
[11:51] at these things
[11:54] when comparing this to
[11:56] um
[11:58] other comparing this to
[12:00] um
[12:02] other words
[12:04] i was thinking of the word perseverance
[12:08] but uh
[12:10] when you when you hear brother branham
[12:12] speaking of
[12:13] uh
[12:15] when you look at things in your life and
[12:17] you wonder why things are
[12:19] happening the way they are brother brown
[12:20] says you know when we have confessed our
[12:23] sins and met every requirement that god
[12:25] requires
[12:26] we believed on god
[12:29] there's a certain their circumstances
[12:31] has to be met and it's according to his
[12:33] will
[12:34] and we've confessed our sins and we've
[12:36] made
[12:37] all the wrongs that we have did right
[12:40] done everything that we know how to do
[12:42] every requirement that god has made
[12:48] or asked
[12:50] we have met that requirement and yet he
[12:52] lays silent
[12:54] he just won't answer us i'm sure that
[12:56] i'm speaking to people's this morning
[12:58] that's come to that place
[13:00] i've been there so many times been there
[13:02] many times myself
[13:04] when i went
[13:07] went back and traced my life and turned
[13:09] over every stone
[13:11] and i find that i did something wrong
[13:14] i'd go confess it
[13:16] i said lord god i'll make it right
[13:18] and go do so then come back again and
[13:21] say now lord thou art god you'll answer
[13:23] me surely i've met every request that
[13:26] you've required me to do and every
[13:28] requirement
[13:29] i've met it and still he won't move
[13:32] seems to be silent
[13:35] that's when you've got to be sure that
[13:37] he is god don't be discouraged the only
[13:40] thing is that in your heart to be
[13:43] certain of god
[13:45] and so sometimes when
[13:47] when we looked at
[13:49] at the word diligence
[13:51] you know it's
[13:53] to look at everything
[13:55] in a
[13:58] in a careful way
[13:59] because one of the one of the
[14:01] definitions of looking at something
[14:03] being diligent is
[14:04] to stop and look at everything and
[14:07] search
[14:08] through things
[14:11] as brother i'm speaking here stop and
[14:12] overturn every stone go back through
[14:14] everything in your life and make sure
[14:16] everything is okay
[14:20] and so when you want to be diligent you
[14:22] want to look at every aspect of
[14:24] everything to go through everything not
[14:25] just to
[14:26] be moving forward
[14:29] here in
[14:31] in
[14:32] the this definition for perseverance
[14:35] it says continuing a course of action
[14:37] without regard to this discouragement
[14:39] opposition or previous failure
[14:42] it says persistent determination to
[14:44] adhere to a plan of direction
[14:46] insistence
[14:48] now brother brennam said in the message
[14:50] perseverance he said that you know it
[14:52] means to persist
[14:54] to set a goal to move forward
[14:57] consider persist means to continue
[14:59] firmly
[15:00] or obstinately
[15:02] an opinion or a course of action despite
[15:05] of difficulty opposition
[15:08] or failure
[15:09] so you persist in a way
[15:13] and
[15:14] many times we have things in our lives
[15:16] and we're facing something
[15:19] but many times if we don't go back just
[15:21] like brother and preach doors and doors
[15:24] if we go through things in our lives
[15:26] and we allow god to move in one aspect
[15:29] of our life
[15:30] but we don't open up the other things
[15:32] and and look
[15:35] and allow him those other access and
[15:37] stop and say lord is there's doors that
[15:39] i haven't allowed you to come into have
[15:42] i not opened these doors
[15:44] then we can't say that we've had all
[15:46] diligence
[15:50] there's a legal term called due
[15:51] diligence
[15:54] and and due diligence is is a
[15:56] aspect in the law where if you have a
[16:00] legal legal proceeding that takes place
[16:02] if you receive some kind of legal
[16:04] document you've got some it you have to
[16:06] give everybody so much time if uh to
[16:09] respond
[16:11] right if you get a judgment against you
[16:13] that you don't like you have so many
[16:14] days to appeal
[16:17] within everything has it has a legal you
[16:20] have to do your due diligence when
[16:22] you're searching the title on a on a
[16:24] home for a purchase they have to go back
[16:26] and and search so many years and check
[16:28] everything out
[16:30] everything has to be done and that's due
[16:32] diligence when
[16:34] foreclosures or different things they
[16:35] put notices in the paper
[16:38] they try to contact everybody that they
[16:40] can when things are taking place to
[16:43] contact you know
[16:45] relatives of different things you have
[16:47] to contact all different parties all
[16:50] those things is part of that due
[16:51] diligence you've got to do all those
[16:53] steps
[16:55] to cover all those aspects of what would
[16:58] be reasonable
[17:00] and it's the same thing with god you
[17:01] know if we don't allow him to have his
[17:04] full
[17:05] preeminence
[17:07] then we've not done our our due
[17:08] diligence and sometimes we wonder why
[17:10] god's not been pleased with things and
[17:13] why things happen
[17:15] brother braham says why haven't we had a
[17:16] revival
[17:19] well sometimes the reason we have it is
[17:21] because
[17:22] we're
[17:23] hindering god
[17:25] we hinder god in it and the way that
[17:28] god wants to move
[17:30] things that god wants to do and it's
[17:32] like have we taken that
[17:34] due diligence
[17:36] and taken that and said lord what would
[17:38] you have me do or
[17:40] take the time to sit down and pray and
[17:43] what's hindering me what is it that was
[17:47] is unpleasing to you
[17:50] you know sometimes
[17:53] sometimes we just get wrapped up in in
[17:55] life sometimes and
[17:57] just the everyday things of life and
[17:59] sometimes we just
[18:01] we don't take we don't take account of
[18:03] things and
[18:06] we have things like
[18:08] you know
[18:09] brother wade was up here the other other
[18:11] day and and you know he was talking
[18:12] about
[18:13] us being on time
[18:16] and getting here before service and
[18:19] and those things and you know sometimes
[18:20] we we just get in in a frame of mind and
[18:23] sometimes you know we'll say well
[18:27] we're just going through the motions or
[18:30] you know we're just rushing and doing
[18:31] different things and
[18:33] and when somebody says something like
[18:35] that it's like
[18:37] does that really sink into
[18:39] to us do we actually take that to heart
[18:42] or is that just something well brother
[18:44] wade's up here saying that
[18:47] but if it but if it was god speaking
[18:52] or do we just look at it as a man
[18:54] speaking
[18:58] because i take that as god speaking
[19:01] [Music]
[19:03] because i
[19:05] i see this church
[19:10] and you know brother graham said our
[19:11] unconfessed sin
[19:15] you know the things that we do just
[19:16] minor things we think we think it's not
[19:18] a it's not a big thing
[19:20] but it could be so moderate
[19:23] but you know that could cause this
[19:24] church to bitterly fail
[19:26] what brother brown said
[19:29] we could hinder the church
[19:33] and we just said well that's that's just
[19:34] a small no
[19:36] if it's in the word
[19:38] then we we need to take
[19:40] a more earnest heat as the scripture
[19:42] tells us to the things that we've heard
[19:45] we need to we need to hold on to these
[19:47] things right
[19:50] and
[19:52] when i was speaking here
[19:56] perseverance and
[19:59] diligence
[20:01] there's a couple of stories i wanna
[20:03] i wanna tell
[20:05] and one of them is brother brown tells
[20:07] it in the in the great coming revival
[20:09] and the outs
[20:10] outpouring of the holy ghost
[20:12] here brother i'm speaking of paul raider
[20:16] and he speaks of paul rayder and
[20:21] scroll down there or scroll up brothers
[20:25] you stop
[20:29] but anyway he says and he believed in
[20:31] god
[20:32] paul raider preaks divine healing he not
[20:35] only preached it but he practiced it
[20:37] so he went
[20:40] so he went
[20:42] unconscious
[20:44] he was talking about when
[20:46] brother paul was battling the fever
[20:50] he said when he had dreamed he was back
[20:52] in the woods as a logger
[20:54] as he used to be and cutting the timber
[20:57] and he said he cut a big log his boss
[20:59] sent him
[21:05] yeah his boss sent him okay
[21:08] his boss sent him up on the hill to cut
[21:10] a log
[21:11] and said he cut the log stuck his axe in
[21:14] the soft timber of the evergreen and he
[21:16] started to pick it up
[21:17] and he just couldn't pick it up it was
[21:19] too much for him
[21:21] said he said
[21:23] well why
[21:24] would my boss ask me to cut a log like
[21:26] this and couldn't pick it up
[21:29] he said if you get this symbol of what
[21:31] it meant god will never give you nothing
[21:33] this this gospel do what he give you
[21:36] grace to do it with that's right he will
[21:39] never promise
[21:40] thus in there but what he will fulfill
[21:44] it and said he tried to pick it up and
[21:47] he couldn't and he said he just wore
[21:48] himself out tugging at it
[21:52] and brother brown goes on
[21:54] and he says that's what's wrong with the
[21:55] church today
[21:57] denominations are tugging at it but they
[21:59] won't let god he said
[22:01] god let men run their limit right now
[22:03] god's letting men have this world let
[22:05] them prove to themselves that they can't
[22:07] run this world god with his mighty hand
[22:09] shows the world cannot stand that's
[22:11] right god rules the world he will rule
[22:13] it through christ jesus
[22:16] but now man wanted
[22:18] to rule
[22:19] and you see what kept what a chaos it's
[22:22] got into
[22:25] now we'll skip down just a little bit
[22:27] there and brother brown continues to
[22:29] talk about brother paul
[22:31] and he says paul said that he tugged at
[22:33] it till he just got tired he just didn't
[22:35] know what to do
[22:37] sat down beside of that tree and started
[22:39] crying he said oh i can't even pick it
[22:41] up i've lost my strength
[22:44] said he heard his
[22:45] voice speak
[22:47] partly he said he heard his boss's voice
[22:49] speak with a kind voice and said paul
[22:52] said what are you struggling at anyhow
[22:55] said why don't you just throw it over
[22:57] there in the water
[22:58] that water runs right on down around the
[23:01] camp
[23:02] said he looked up and his boss was the
[23:04] lord jesus
[23:05] said he just took that old log and
[23:07] pushed it over in the water jumped the
[23:08] straddle
[23:09] of them
[23:11] and went to splash the water
[23:13] riding it down the river hollering i'm
[23:15] riding on it i'm riding on it i'm riding
[23:18] on it instead he was coming riding into
[23:20] the camp screaming with all his voice
[23:22] i'm writing and when he came to himself
[23:23] he was standing right out in the middle
[23:25] of the floor with his hands up in the
[23:27] air screaming i'm riding on it i'm right
[23:29] it's god's promise and he was healed
[23:31] right there in the room
[23:32] and the fever is lifting
[23:36] so
[23:37] you know
[23:40] there was
[23:42] brother paul he was
[23:44] holding on
[23:45] and he kept trying to wrestle that log
[23:50] and that's persevering you know he's
[23:52] over there persevering he's wrestling
[23:53] that log trying to get that log to move
[23:56] but you know when he stopped
[23:59] and he thought
[24:01] and he's i can't do this that's when the
[24:04] lord was able to speak to him and said
[24:05] paul why don't you roll it into the
[24:07] water
[24:09] see if we we can persevere and have
[24:12] persistence and and push things and and
[24:15] we just stay in the same channel and
[24:16] just keep on going right
[24:19] but god doesn't want us just to be
[24:21] perseverant all the time
[24:24] god wants us to be diligent
[24:26] and stop and think well lord how would i
[24:29] how would you want me to do this
[24:31] and then when you come to that point
[24:32] then the lord was able to tell paul roll
[24:34] that log into the water
[24:36] and you can ride it
[24:38] there's another way to go and he said
[24:40] i'm riding on it
[24:42] see when he when he was battling that
[24:43] fever and he was working and and doing
[24:46] all that
[24:47] and we'll have the musicians come on
[24:49] i'll be doing in a minute
[24:51] but when he saw all that taking place
[24:52] and he was
[24:54] wrestling with that thing when he got to
[24:56] the point where he could just roll it
[24:57] over onto god when he cast his cares
[25:00] upon him
[25:02] then the lord could heal him
[25:05] and i was thinking about the
[25:07] there in the in john chapter 5
[25:12] where there was a laying man
[25:13] laying beside the
[25:15] at the pool of bethesda
[25:18] and he laid there
[25:20] 38 years he had that infirmary
[25:22] infirmity
[25:24] but you know what he never gave up
[25:28] every single time the angel troubled the
[25:29] waters he was making his way to the
[25:31] water he was persistent he was
[25:33] perseverant to make that water
[25:36] but you know what
[25:37] jesus saw the faith that the man had
[25:40] and he said will thou be made whole
[25:43] he said lord i keep trying
[25:47] but you know what god told him
[25:49] take up your bed
[25:51] and he was able to take up his bed and
[25:53] walk
[25:58] not just be perseverant but let us all
[26:00] be diligent in what god has called us to
[26:02] do
[26:03] amen god bless you this morning
[26:07] [Applause]
