[2:45] Florida. And it was just a wonderful
[2:47] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:47] &gt;&gt; uh song that spoke with me. And I I've
[2:49] been going through the Holy Ghost
[2:50] series. It's one of my favorite series
[2:52] that Brother Bram preached [music] I
[2:53] think in 59. And he talks about that
[2:57] that spirit of [music] truth, that
[2:58] comforter that is with us, that
[3:01] advocate. And wherever
[3:03] he said, "Wherever I am, you're going to
[3:05] be." That's the promise. [snorts] And
[3:08] wherever you go, just remember, [music]
[3:10] even if you feel alone, you're not

[8:29] journey also with each other cuz we're
[8:31] family and that's what family does.
[8:34] We're [music] there for each other. But
[8:36] it's the spirit that's in us that keeps
[8:38] us. It's the spirit that in us that
[8:41] guides us.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; And if you're family, and I believe you
[8:44] are, can you [music] just turn to your

[9:28] All these smiling faces out here this
[9:30] morning. It's good to be here this
[9:31] morning. Well, cold and brisky makes you
[9:33] feel chilly when you go outside. Step a
[9:37] little peppery that cold moist ground.
[9:42] We're going to be reading from John this
[9:44] morning. U John 14 1-15.
[9:49] And let's just thank him before we go to
[9:51] his word this morning. Precious heavenly
[9:53] father, we thank you for this day you've
[9:54] come together around your word one more
[9:56] time, Lord. And we ask you just come
[9:58] down and bless us, Father. And most of
[10:00] all, come down, Father, and reveal your
[10:02] word to us, Lord. We need it more than
[10:04] anything. And we thank you today for
[10:07] just being here and all the ones that
[10:09] can make it through the door. But Lord,
[10:11] bless those that couldn't make it
[10:12] through the door today. Just be with
[10:14] them and you know their needs and touch
[10:16] them and bless them. And Father, we ask
[10:17] that those ones still out there in the
[10:21] desert, Lord, you know who [snorts] they
[10:22] are. Your word says it. And I'll say it
[10:25] again. We'll be there with our offspring
[10:28] and ask you, Lord, to bring them in.
[10:30] Whatever it takes. We ask, Father God,
[10:33] today that you just be with Brother Wade
[10:35] and bless him on his journey, Lord, and
[10:37] bring him home safely. And most of all,
[10:40] let the little people up there in
[10:41] Tennessee be blessed by what he brings
[10:43] today. And we ask you today also bless
[10:45] brother Louu.
[10:47] Bless him Lord. Let him speak those
[10:49] words you placed on his heart and stare
[10:50] his heart. Lord
[10:52] Louis is a precious brother. Lord
[10:55] everywhere he goes. He's talking about
[10:58] you, Lord. And that's what we all need
[11:00] to be doing is preaching your word,
[11:02] Lord, and becoming your word. And ask
[11:05] you just to be with brother Luis now as
[11:06] he's coming today. And ask now, Father,
[11:09] that as the word comes forth, you just
[11:11] come down and be with us and bless the
[11:13] service today, Lord. And we ask these
[11:16] precious things in your name, Jesus
[11:19] Christ. Amen.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; John 14,
[11:27] [crying]
[11:28] let not your heart be troubled. You
[11:30] believe in God, believe also in me.
[11:36] If it were not soare, [crying]
[11:43] &gt;&gt; and if I go and prepare a place for you,
[11:45] I will come again and receive you unto
[11:48] myself, that where I am, there ye may be
[11:52] also.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; I go, you know, and the way you know.
[11:58] Thomas saith unto him,"Lord,
[12:01] we know not whether thou goest, and how
[12:04] can we know the way?"
[12:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus said unto him, "I am the way,
[12:10] truth, and life. No man cometh unto the
[12:14] Father by me."
[12:16] &gt;&gt; If ye had known me, ye should have known
[12:19] my father also. And from henceforth ye
[12:22] know him, and have seen him.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:27] to him, Lord, show us the Father and
[12:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus said unto him, Have I been so long
[12:35] with you, and yet hast thou not known
[12:38] me, Philillip? He that has seen me has
[12:41] seen the Father. And how sayest thou
[12:45] then, show us the Father?
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Believest thou not that I am in the
[12:50] Father, and the Father in me. The words
[12:54] that I speak unto you, I speak not of
[12:56] myself, but the father that dwelleth in
[12:59] meths.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; Believe me that I am in the father and
[13:05] the father in me. Or else believe me for
[13:08] the very work's sake.
[13:11] verily I say unto you that believeth on
[13:14] mess that I do shall he do also and
[13:18] greater works than these shall he do
[13:21] because I go unto my father
[13:24] &gt;&gt; and whosoever ye shall ask in my name or
[13:27] whatsoever I'm sorry ye shall ask in my
[13:29] name that will I do that the father may
[13:32] be glorified in the son
[13:35] &gt;&gt; if you shall ask anything in my name I
[13:38] will do
[13:39] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[13:40] &gt;&gt; If you love me, keep my commandments.
[13:44] Thank you for the reading of the word.
[13:45] You may be seated.
[14:01] Amen. You know, if there's any verse I
[14:04] would encourage you to remember by what
[14:07] brother Donnie read is verse three. If I
[14:11] go and prepare a place, I'll prepare
[14:14] prepare a place for you and I'll come
[14:15] again to receive you unto myself.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; You know, we have our places, we have
[14:21] our homes here, but when you come to the
[14:22] end of life,
[14:25] you kind of wonder what's on the next
[14:26] side. There's a place he said he
[14:29] prepares for us. There's a lot of
[14:31] believers that have went on. They're at
[14:33] that place waiting on us. [snorts] What
[14:36] a promise.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Some There's so many people in this
[14:39] world that don't have that assurance,
[14:42] &gt;&gt; but we have that assurance. And I tell
[14:44] you, that makes me happy to know that my
[14:46] Lord has prepared a place for me.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; No matter how rich you are, how poor you
[14:52] are, there's a place there for you.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; And I thank God for that this morning.
[14:56] Amen. Brother, would you come and take
[14:58] up the offering for us?
[15:31] Amen. Yes. Just um also remember that
[15:34] the fellowship meeting is next Saturday
[15:37] um January 17th. Brother Daryl Ward will
[15:39] be with us. Starts at 3:00 in the
[15:41] evening. So come and worship and just be
[15:43] a part of the [snorts] gathering. Um you
[15:46] know there just something about
[15:48] fellowship. Um, just a personal little
[15:51] testimony. When I was younger, I didn't
[15:52] like to be around people. I was an
[15:54] introvert and I just didn't want to be
[15:56] around people. It's just something that
[15:57] was in my personality.
[15:59] But there's just something about the
[16:00] spirit of God that kind of breaks that.
[16:03] And you kind of grow into this. They're
[16:05] not just people. They're a part of a
[16:07] body. They're a family. And um, you
[16:11] know, I'm sure there's some natural
[16:12] family members people don't like to be
[16:14] around. But when you get in the spirit
[16:17] of God, you just don't see each other's
[16:18] faults. you just appreciate people being
[16:20] there
[16:21] &gt;&gt; because we had a prophet that said, "We
[16:24] got a future home we're going to." So,
[16:26] come and fellowship, be a part of
[16:28] something bigger than just your home.
[16:31] Cuz God can use you. He really can if
[16:33] you let him. And uh I've learned that.
[16:36] And so, it's just part of surrendering.
[16:39] Amen. It's part of giving our life away
[16:41] to him. And that's what we're going to
[16:44] sing here
[16:45] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[16:45] &gt;&gt; uh before our brother comes in [music] a
[16:46] little while. Amen.
[16:48] No earthly price could [singing] be too
[16:52] great.
[16:54] No sacrifice
[16:56] too much [singing and music] to make.
[17:00] No way of measure in the cross
[17:06] next to the blood of [singing] Calary's
[17:09] cross.
[17:11] So if I live, I live for him. [music]
[17:17] or if I die, I count it gain.
[17:22] My life is not my [singing] own, but his
[17:27] from this day on. [music]
[17:33] And now I'm [singing] giving my life
[17:37] away, [music]
[17:40] laying [singing] it down on the altar.
[17:44] Now I'm giving my life away.
[17:50] [music]
[17:51] The very least [singing]
[17:53] I can offer
[17:56] is my [singing] own.
[18:01] [music] So here I [singing] stand today
[18:06] giving my life away.
[18:11] [music]
[18:12] And I've seen [singing] a vision heart
[18:16] since we
[18:18] one who gave all he had for
[18:22] [music and singing] me.
[18:24] I've seen the passion of his death
[18:29] and [music] the forgiveness in his final
[18:33] breath.
[18:35] Now I can never be [singing] the same.
[18:41] My heart has been forever. You [music]
[18:44] changed.
[18:46] And I've got to live and love and
[18:50] [singing] give because he gave.
[18:55] [music]
[18:57] And now I'm giving my life away.
[19:04] [music] I'm
[19:04] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[19:04] &gt;&gt; laying it down on the altar.
[19:09] Now I'm giving [music and singing] my
[19:11] life away.
[19:15] The very least [singing and music]
[19:17] I can over
[19:20] is my own. [singing]
[19:25] So here I stand today
[19:30] giving my life away. Let's sing that
[19:33] first verse. [music]
[19:36] Oh, no earthly price could be too great.
[19:42] No [music] sacrifice
[19:44] too much [singing] to make.
[19:48] No way of measureing
[19:51] the cost
[19:53] next to the [singing] blood of Calary's
[19:57] cross.
[19:59] So if I live, I live [singing] for him.
[20:05] or if I die, [music] I count [singing]
[20:08] it gain.
[20:10] My life is not my own, but his from Oh,
[20:16] do you just want to surrender to him
[20:17] this morning?
[20:20] Oh, now I'm giving [music] my life.
[20:27] I'm laying it down on [singing] the
[20:30] altar.
[20:32] Now I'm giving my life away.
[20:39] The very [singing] least [music] I can
[20:41] offer
[20:43] is my own.
[20:46] [singing]
[20:47] [music]
[20:48] So here I stand today
[20:53] giving my life. Oh just raise your hands
[20:56] and surrender to him.
[20:59] Oh, now I'm giving my life away.
[21:06] I'm laying it down on
[21:08] [music and singing] the altar.
[21:12] Giving my life away. [singing]
[21:15] [music]
[21:17] The very least I can offer
[21:22] is my [singing] own.
[21:27] So here I stand today,
[21:31] giving my [singing] life away.
[21:36] Oh, now I'm giving [music] my life away.
[21:44] I'm laying it down [singing and music]
[21:46] on the altar. Now I'm giving my life
[21:51] [music]
[21:52] away.
[21:55] The very least [music and singing]
[21:57] I can offer
[22:00] is my all is my all.
[22:05] So [music] here I stand today
[22:09] giving my life away.
[22:16] [music]

[22:33] yourself. Lay it on the altar of God.

[30:58] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. [applause]
[31:00] Give a little clap of praise.
[31:01] Hallelujah.
[31:06] Amen. What a wonderful thing it is to
[31:09] rely on his grace.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; When you receive grace, you have grace
[31:14] to give out. Amen.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; But when you don't receive grace, and I
[31:19] just don't see how how we cannot receive
[31:23] his grace,
[31:24] there's plenty of grace. We serve a
[31:27] gracious God. Amen.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. You excuse me
[31:31] while try to fix
[31:35] get all these things taken care of.
[31:39] All right.
[31:43] All right.
[31:45] Praise the Lord.
[31:47] Hopefully
[31:49] that comes up. Amen. Well, God bless you
[31:51] all. It's good to be in the house of the
[31:53] Lord. I trust that uh everyone has uh
[31:56] had a good week and uh it's good to be
[31:59] back.
[32:01] Hopefully uh everybody's ready to face
[32:04] another year.
[32:07] We don't know what God has in store, but
[32:09] definitely
[32:11] uh we're relying on him. Amen.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; It's not up to us to worry about what's
[32:15] going to happen.
[32:17] It's up to us to rely on what he already
[32:20] said in his word.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then that's and then you just
[32:24] you just have confidence that what he's
[32:26] doing in our lives, in the world, and
[32:29] everything that's happening. Amen. You
[32:32] It's all about preparing a bride.
[32:36] Amen.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; And you're the one who prepares. The
[32:39] bride is the one who who dressed herself
[32:41] in the word. Amen. So all these things
[32:44] and all these signs and all these
[32:46] different things that we're seeing, it's
[32:47] all just pointing us to keep getting
[32:50] ready. Keep getting ready. Keep putting
[32:52] more of the word on. Amen.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Um we appreciate
[32:56] all your prayers as we were out and uh
[32:59] traveling and it's good to be back where
[33:02] it's a little warmer. Uh,
[33:05] and we're not shoveling snow. Uh, if if
[33:09] you didn't know, when we were in Canada
[33:10] visiting my wife's family there for for
[33:14] the holidays and, uh, when we were going
[33:16] in, it was snowing and snowstorms. We
[33:20] went through two snowstorms coming
[33:22] through and then when we were leaving
[33:23] Canada, it was snowing. But, uh, I tell
[33:27] you what, shoveling snow is a wonderful
[33:29] exercise,
[33:31] man. And I had to shovel snow a couple
[33:33] of times and it it really helps. I felt
[33:35] it felt really good afterwards. I mean,
[33:37] you're you're breathing hard breathing
[33:40] hard. But um I can see why people up
[33:44] there want to come down to Myrtle Beach,
[33:46] South Carolina,
[33:48] the Canadians during the winter time.
[33:50] But it was good to be with my wife's
[33:52] family. Haven't spent the holidays with
[33:54] him in in a few years. And it was really
[33:56] good to do that. And so, uh, appreciate
[33:59] the Lord also bringing my my daughter
[34:01] back, Bella, back safely from Europe.
[34:04] Uh, she had a good time there at the
[34:06] meetings that they had and got to travel
[34:08] around in different places that that
[34:10] even my wife and I haven't been to. So,
[34:13] appreciate the Lord bringing her back
[34:14] safely. Before we go to the word, just
[34:17] remind uh and I know these have already
[34:19] been mentioned, but next weekend of
[34:21] course is the is the uh fellowship
[34:23] meeting uh January 17th. So you, as
[34:26] brother Joe said, you're definitely
[34:28] welcome to come be here. It's at 3 p.m.
[34:31] And brother Daryl Ward, he's going to be
[34:33] ministering for us. And usually we
[34:35] always get re get a blessing when
[34:37] brother Daryl Ward comes around.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; So uh I encourage you all to to come and
[34:42] and listen to the word and just
[34:44] fellowship. And uh also today is the
[34:47] last day for the sisters to sign up for
[34:49] the foods that we'll bring for the
[34:51] fellowship meeting uh next Saturday.
[34:53] Okay. So, sisters, please use the signup
[34:55] sheet on the refrigerator downstairs to
[34:59] list your name and the food you will
[35:01] bring. Amen. And of course, also still
[35:04] more than a month away, the church
[35:06] Valentine banquet will be held on
[35:08] Saturday, February 21. So, there will be
[35:11] a signup sheet for that as well down
[35:13] there downstairs.
[35:15] Amen. Praise the Lord. I also want to
[35:18] thank each and every one of you all for
[35:21] praying for my for my uncle Hugo. And I
[35:24] know that some of you all have uh asked
[35:27] about um about his condition and about
[35:31] where he's currently at. I believe God
[35:34] has has been answering prayer.
[35:36] He's slowly waking back up. But uh what
[35:41] what he has is is called chronic
[35:44] destructive pulmonary disease. which is
[35:47] uh it's in the group of lung diseases uh
[35:50] which includes emphyma and chronic
[35:52] bronchitis.
[35:53] His heart has been affected as well for
[35:56] for the past several years. He used to
[35:58] be a heavy smoker and um and usually a
[36:02] form of this is what happens to heavy
[36:05] smokers. He was also a an alcoholic as
[36:08] well. and uh my my mom, she told me to
[36:13] tell you all to personally thank you
[36:15] very much because that's her brother and
[36:18] she really thanks the prayers of the
[36:20] saints and I believe God is answering
[36:22] prayer. I told my mom I said mom the
[36:25] other day I said mom don't worry about
[36:27] it try not to you know because you know
[36:30] my mom she's the oldest of all the
[36:31] siblings and he's the second and of
[36:35] course she's about two years older. I
[36:37] said, "We don't want you to get sick
[36:39] just because you're trying you're
[36:40] wearing, right?" But she I told her, I
[36:44] said, "If anything happens, let the
[36:46] Lord's will be done." I said, "But if
[36:48] whatever happens, you you you don't you
[36:52] don't have to be regretful because about
[36:54] two or three years ago, she was the one
[36:57] who was instrumental to leading him to
[36:58] the Lord.
[37:00] Even while she was here, she's always in
[37:02] communication with them. and she led him
[37:04] to the Lord and he got baptized last
[37:07] year as well. And ever since that he's
[37:10] been he's been a just a man of faith, a
[37:13] man of faith. And he keeps con confiding
[37:16] and and and confessing that he the
[37:18] [snorts] Lord is going to heal him. The
[37:20] Lord is going to heal him.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; And and he's had several times already
[37:24] he goes to the he goes to the hospital
[37:26] for it seems like he's going and then he
[37:29] gets better, comes back. He has a an
[37:32] infection in his stomach, goes to the
[37:34] hospital, and just different things,
[37:36] multiple things that have happened to
[37:38] him in the last several years. But he
[37:40] just keeps confessing the word,
[37:41] confessing the word, confessing his
[37:43] healing, confessing his healing. And I
[37:46] tell you what, it's an encouragement to
[37:47] me because um you know, he's only he's
[37:50] only a baby in Christ. And then
[37:52] sometimes some of us who've been in the
[37:54] Christian walk a long time, we have a
[37:56] hard time confessing God's promised. And
[37:59] he encourages me. He encourages my mom.
[38:02] He encourages. So it's amazing what God
[38:04] through trials and things and problems,
[38:07] the way he turns things around to use
[38:10] those people to speak to us.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I encourage you all to just
[38:14] please continue to pray for my uncle
[38:16] Hugo that the Lord would just um raise
[38:19] him up if it be his perfect will and
[38:22] that the medicines that they're having
[38:24] to give him right now won't affect his
[38:26] kidneys because that that's what they're
[38:28] they're they're they're concerned about.
[38:31] Uh, of course, if that affects his
[38:34] kidneys, then he'll have to have
[38:36] dialysis and things like that and we
[38:38] don't want that. So, but so we just
[38:40] appreciate your prayers. Also, just
[38:43] continue to pray for brother Wade this
[38:44] morning as he's ministering there in
[38:46] Tennessee. All right, let's just go. How
[38:48] many are ready for the word?
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's uh read this scripture
[38:53] here and I'll have you be seated in
[38:56] Psalms chapter 51:12.
[38:59] This morning, I I I want to give a New
[39:02] Year's uh message. And uh even though
[39:05] we're already 11 days in, but it's still
[39:08] New Year's.
[39:10] Amen. It's still It's still,
[39:14] you know, time just goes by so fast, but
[39:17] but here we are in 2026.
[39:19] I know a lot of us never imagined that
[39:21] we'd be here in 2026, but here we are.
[39:25] Amen. The Lord says here in Psalms 51,
[39:28] it says, "Restore unto me the joy of thy
[39:32] salvation
[39:34] and uphold me with thy free spirit." Of
[39:36] course, this is David speaking when he
[39:39] was repenting. In Lamentations 5:21,
[39:42] this is the New Living Translation. It
[39:43] says, "Restore us, O Lord, and bring us
[39:46] back to you again, man. Give us back the
[39:49] joys we once had."
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Isaiah 40:31 says,
[39:57] "But they that wait upon the Lord shall
[40:01] renew their strength. They shall mount
[40:04] up with wings as eagles. They shall run
[40:08] and not be weary, and they shall walk
[40:11] and not faint."
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. I want to talk
[40:15] this morning. It's not mysteries and
[40:18] it's not thunders and and and and seals,
[40:21] but I believe this is just as
[40:23] foundational and as as as as as deep and
[40:27] some of we have different people with
[40:29] different walks of life,
[40:31] &gt;&gt; but I believe we serve a God of new
[40:33] beginnings.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe that this
[40:36] morning?
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Let's just bow
[40:38] our heads this morning. Heavenly Father,
[40:41] we come before you once again, Lord,
[40:43] knowing that you are the God of new
[40:45] beginnings. Father, you, heavenly
[40:48] father, are such a graceful, gracious
[40:50] God, full of mercy, Lord God, and slow
[40:53] to anger. And Lord, we just appreciate,
[40:56] Lord, the grace and the mercy that you
[40:58] have bestowed upon us, Lord, throughout
[41:00] our lives, Lord God. We wouldn't be
[41:02] where we are now, Father God, if it
[41:05] wasn't for you, Lord, bringing us
[41:07] through. And we pray now that you would
[41:09] just forgive us for our sins. Place
[41:12] anything that would hinder the service,
[41:13] Lord, under the blood of Jesus Christ
[41:16] this morning. May heavenly father just
[41:19] have your way. Use my lips to say
[41:21] something that would benefit your
[41:22] people, Lord God, and that would bring
[41:24] you glory, Lord Jesus. And Father God,
[41:28] hinder me from saying anything that I
[41:30] shouldn't, Lord God, that would not
[41:32] bring you glory and that would hinder
[41:33] your people, Lord Jesus. Grant it, Lord
[41:36] God. We just commit ourselves now to
[41:38] you. Continue to be with brother Wade,
[41:39] Sister June, as they travel. Protect
[41:42] them. Bring them back home safely, Lord
[41:43] God Almighty. And Lord, we we just
[41:46] commit the service into your hands and
[41:48] all the needs, Father God, that are
[41:50] represented here, Lord Jesus, into your
[41:52] hands now. We ask, we pray and ask these
[41:54] things in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[41:57] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[42:03] Praise the Lord.
[42:08] Amen. This morning, we just want to kind
[42:10] of do it in a form of a in a form of a
[42:14] Sunday school, but we'll see how the
[42:15] Lord leads. Amen. And uh
[42:19] um I just pray that you'd be blessed.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I want to start with this
[42:25] slide right here. I know this has
[42:27] success, but I found this and I thought
[42:29] it was very interesting. Sometimes our
[42:31] our Christian walk is kind of like we
[42:34] think that it's it's the it's the
[42:35] straight line that when we start serving
[42:38] God that it's going to be just fine and
[42:40] dandy, the straight line and then and
[42:42] then what people think it really is
[42:45] looks like it's it's the second one, the
[42:47] middle one. It's all curvy and it's all
[42:49] it's all but in reality it's the last
[42:52] one. [laughter]
[42:54] How many can say that?
[42:57] It's it's sometimes you're up, you're
[42:59] sometimes you're down. Sometimes it's
[43:01] it's you're you're you're happy and
[43:03] you're and you're and you're moving. Oh,
[43:05] I'm moving forward. This is the year
[43:07] where I'm and but then something happens
[43:09] and you're back again and then oh and
[43:12] then and and this is how it is.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; I mean, I hope that I'm not the only
[43:16] one.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Just because I'm a preacher, you know
[43:19] that that you know, doesn't mean that it
[43:20] doesn't happen to to us. It happens to
[43:22] us a lot. Espec As a matter of fact, The
[43:26] devil attacks preachers more than
[43:28] anybody else.
[43:30] And so, um, uh, that's the reality. But
[43:34] I'm so glad that in the middle of all
[43:36] that, Amen. God knows the way. God knows
[43:41] the way. And now I have this this little
[43:43] like a five six second clip and it's in
[43:47] it the the the the meme it's a little
[43:49] meme but but but it it says it says it
[43:52] in Spanish and I'll just I'll pause it
[43:54] here for you and translate it for you.
[43:57] Hopefully it plays.
[44:03] Now it says here this is when God when I
[44:06] show God my plans. The man on the right
[44:09] is you. the the the man the older man on
[44:12] the left is is is is is God, right? And
[44:15] then the man on the right, which is you,
[44:18] he's holding and wielding a sword in
[44:19] front of the man in front of front of
[44:21] the old man. And this is what happens.
[44:25] This is me, God, showing God my plans.
[44:29] And then look what God does.
[44:35] He don't care about your plans.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; It's nothing to him.
[44:40] So whatever plans you had for this year,
[44:44] you [laughter]
[44:45] hey, you better make sure it's with the
[44:46] word,
[44:48] &gt;&gt; whether it's business related or whether
[44:50] what school, whatever your friends, how
[44:53] whatever you're going to do. Amen. Make
[44:55] sure it's guided by the word.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Because to God, he'll allow you to come
[45:00] through whatever you want to do. He'll
[45:02] he'll allow permissive will into your
[45:04] life, but eventually it will come to his
[45:06] perfect will.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Joe and I, we were
[45:09] talking back there how how when when the
[45:12] Lord uh when brother with brother
[45:13] Brandham back in the 50s and and brother
[45:16] Brandham was when he was supposed to go
[45:18] to uh Durban, South Africa, I believe,
[45:22] and he he he didn't he didn't go or or
[45:26] or something on the lines where he
[45:28] wasn't supposed to go or but he wasn't
[45:31] there and he took a a a a detour and
[45:35] went through Portugal
[45:37] and you can go back in the message and
[45:39] read that and how God even though he was
[45:42] out of the will of God. I told brother
[45:44] Joe that I don't think that brother
[45:45] Brandham would have even had visited
[45:47] Portugal if if he had not if he had not
[45:51] if he had disobey if he had not
[45:52] disobeyed God at that moment. And so
[45:55] it's amazing. And in Portugal the the
[45:58] you can read there in the message how
[45:59] God used he said brother Ram said he had
[46:02] some of the best meetings that he has
[46:04] ever had in Portugal. And there's people
[46:06] there in the message right now serving
[46:08] the Lord.
[46:10] So God can take whatever plan you have,
[46:13] anything in your life, Amen. And use it
[46:17] for his perfect will.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Now, so we're
[46:23] talking about a God, the God of new
[46:25] beginnings. Amen. How many believe that
[46:28] God is gives is is is a God of many
[46:31] chances?
[46:34] &gt;&gt; I I hope we serve a God of many chances
[46:37] &gt;&gt; because if not, Amen. we're we're we're
[46:40] condemned. We're doomed. Amen. But many
[46:43] Christians uh especially younger
[46:45] Christians, they live their life as
[46:47] follows. They feel an urgency, amen, to
[46:50] serve God. I I got to write, I got to
[46:52] make my life right. So what they do is
[46:55] they repent. They know they have to
[46:57] repent. Then they do well for a while.
[47:01] Then they start drifting again.
[47:04] And then they feel guilty again.
[47:07] And then that urgency comes back again.
[47:11] And then and so on and so on. And and
[47:13] and it's a cycle. It's a it's a roller
[47:16] coaster.
[47:17] Right.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; It's a roller coaster ride and God does
[47:21] not want us to have a roller coaster
[47:23] Christian life. Amen.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I mean, we know that
[47:28] that that that not because of something
[47:30] that you've done. We know that God
[47:32] allows tri trials, tribulations, and
[47:34] problems that will cause our lives to go
[47:37] up and down, up and down, but we're
[47:39] we're staying intact in the cart. Right.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Right. But sometimes we allow roller
[47:45] coaster life in our life because of
[47:47] because of us. We're the ones who who
[47:49] who who make the Christian life
[47:52] difficult for ourselves.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. God doesn't make it difficult. If
[47:56] you stay hidden behind his word, Amen.
[47:59] It's He said, "My my burdens are easy
[48:02] and my my burden is light." Amen.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; So if you've placed everything upon him,
[48:07] Amen. It should be simple. The problem
[48:10] is is that we like to pick up the
[48:11] burdens again and think that we can do
[48:13] it again on our own. That there's
[48:16] something that you got to do. But in
[48:18] reality, amen, God has already ba did
[48:21] the work for you. Praise God. All you
[48:23] got to do is place put put his uh uh uh
[48:26] put his trust put your trust in his
[48:28] word. So this constant cycle, it makes
[48:31] you feel like you're a fake and not a
[48:34] true Christian.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've been there, done that, man.
[48:40] Makes you feel make makes you feel like
[48:42] like you're not even worthy. So why
[48:46] would why would God if I've failed him
[48:48] once, why would God accept me again? But
[48:51] you'd be surprised.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. You'd be surprised
[48:56] because we serve a God that that is more
[48:59] gracious than what we think he is.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want you to understand that
[49:04] this this morning that the spirit
[49:06] spiritual struggle does not mean that
[49:09] the Holy Spirit is not working in your
[49:11] life. All right, let me repeat that
[49:14] again. Spiritual struggle does not mean
[49:16] that the Holy Spirit is not working in
[49:17] your life. If the Holy Spirit was
[49:20] measured by how much of a flawless life
[49:22] you have, then no one would have him.
[49:26] But it's not about how much flawlessness
[49:29] you have or how little you you you make
[49:32] mistakes. Amen. It's about what he has
[49:36] already done for you to make sure that
[49:38] he's taken care of your mistakes. Amen.
[49:41] When you confess to him. Praise God.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; And the problem is is that we don't h
[49:46] we're not we are not humble enough and
[49:49] and and it really it comes down to
[49:51] unbelief in his word. Yeah.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; We don't believe enough that his power,
[49:58] Amen, to restore us is sufficient for
[50:01] our lives.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; And so what happens is we get caught up
[50:04] in these cycles up and down, up and
[50:07] down. I do wrong and then I repent. I do
[50:10] wrong again. I repent up and down. I'm
[50:12] not sure if he's going to take me in. He
[50:15] is ready and willing. Amen. With a
[50:16] merciful hand to take anybody in who who
[50:19] who repents from their heart.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not repenting because your parents
[50:25] are watching you. Not repenting because
[50:27] the pastor might say something about
[50:29] you. But repenting because you know that
[50:31] you have failed him. But you want to
[50:34] come back to his fold and he has his o
[50:36] arms ready open for you.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; I mean his arms were open for you. Amen.
[50:41] On the cross of Calvary.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; He wasn't like this. He wasn't crucified
[50:47] like this. He was crucified like this.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:52] Praise God. So Paul says in Romans
[50:55] chapter 7 and verse 19, he says, "For
[50:57] the good that I would, I do not, but the
[51:00] evil which I would not, that I do." And
[51:04] this is this this wasn't an unbeliever
[51:06] speaking this. And it it was an apostle,
[51:09] a prophet a and the Ephesus church age
[51:13] messenger who was who was saying this. E
[51:16] even Paul
[51:18] was struggling with the law of sin that
[51:21] dwelt in him. Amen.
[51:24] Even Paul was tempted. Amen. Even Jesus
[51:28] was tempted. Praise God. But without
[51:31] sin. Amen.
[51:33] We make mistakes. We may fail him. Amen.
[51:38] But if if we didn't, then Jesus then
[51:41] Jesus what Jesus did for us, Amen. would
[51:43] have been in vain.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Right.
[51:46] He He knew that he was going to come and
[51:49] die for imperfect people.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Because if you're perfect, then there
[51:55] was no purpose for him to come and die
[51:57] for you. But because you're not perfect,
[52:00] Amen.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he had a reason to come and
[52:03] for you. Praise God.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; So if you if you go back and read in in
[52:10] Romans chapter 7, and I encourage you to
[52:12] go back and just read that whole
[52:13] chapter, read chapter 6, 7, and then 8.
[52:17] And Paul is explaining here the inner
[52:20] conflict inside someone who knows God's
[52:22] law but still struggles in their
[52:24] Christian walk. And he he explains that
[52:27] the problem is not God's law, which is
[52:30] good and holy, but the sinful nature
[52:33] that remains in you. Amen. God. It's not
[52:36] the problem is not with the word. The
[52:38] problem is with you
[52:40] &gt;&gt; because you don't believe the word
[52:41] enough. Amen. To think that God can take
[52:44] care of your sin. That God can take care
[52:47] of your problem. You know saints or as
[52:51] the more you live this life, the more
[52:52] you realize how dependent you are on
[52:54] God.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. the more you you the more you
[52:59] realize that that that when God has
[53:02] truly done something in your life,
[53:04] you're going to have that black dog and
[53:06] that white dog fighting inside of you.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Remember that brother Brandham talked
[53:10] about that. All right? And if you don't
[53:13] have that fight within you, if you don't
[53:15] have that struggle within you, then I'm
[53:17] afraid God has not done something in
[53:19] you. But as long as you have that fight,
[53:22] amen, inside of you, when even if you
[53:25] fail, but you know, amen, beyond the
[53:28] shadow of doubt, that God's word is
[53:29] true, and you know that even if you
[53:32] fail, you can go back to the word and
[53:34] the word restores you. Amen. Praise God.
[53:37] Then that gives you strength. Amen. To
[53:39] continue fighting in that fight.
[53:41] Remember, brother Brandon preached that
[53:42] message, the battle is in the mind.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is Satan's battleground, but
[53:48] this is all God's al battleground as
[53:50] well. See, it's like a tugofwar, saints.
[53:53] Amen. A tugof-war where where where
[53:55] Satan, he's pulling and God is also
[53:57] pulling and you're in the middle.
[54:00] Amen. But we know at the end is God is
[54:03] the victor. Amen. And and if you know in
[54:07] a in a game of tugof-war, Amen. only one
[54:09] side can win.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; There can be no two winners in a tugof
[54:14] war. only one side can win. And and and
[54:17] whoever wins is takes the whole rope
[54:21] [laughter]
[54:21] &gt;&gt; and you're in the middle. And we know at
[54:24] the end of the book, Amen. God ends up
[54:26] winning. And if you're tied to him,
[54:28] Amen. You're a winner with God. Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; So, you're caught in a tug of war. Amen.
[54:36] Satan is after your soul, but so is God.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; But God is the one who created you.
[54:44] Satan did not create you
[54:46] &gt;&gt; because Satan is not a creator.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful for that. Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[54:56] Amen. So, so is Paul saying here, since
[55:00] sin lives in me, I might as well give
[55:02] into give into it every time. Is that
[55:05] what Paul says in in in in in in Romans
[55:08] chapter 7? And of course, the answer is
[55:11] no.
[55:12] He is only explaining why sin happens,
[55:15] not excusing it or saying it's all right
[55:18] to surrender to it. Amen.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he clearly he he makes this uh
[55:24] clear in the previous chapter in Romans
[55:25] chapter 6 verse 1-2 where he says,
[55:28] "Shall we continue in sin that grace may
[55:31] abound? God forbid."
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the in the New Living
[55:35] Translation, it says it like this. Well
[55:37] then, should we keep on sinning so that
[55:39] God can show us more and more of his
[55:41] wonderful grace? Of course not. He says,
[55:45] since we have died to sin, how can we
[55:48] continue to live in it?
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; So, if we don't use we don't use Amen.
[55:56] the the grace of God, Amen. to make it a
[55:58] disgrace or to make it greasy grace.
[56:00] Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; We use it, Amen. Praise God. When
[56:04] there's truly been, Amen. a a
[56:06] a genuine mistakes that we make because
[56:09] we're human. We are going to fail and
[56:11] make mistakes.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; But I'm so glad that God, Amen, has a
[56:16] way out for you and I. Amen. How many
[56:19] believe that?
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. So, and so
[56:26] Paul in in in in in Romans 7, he's
[56:28] identifying the source of the problem
[56:30] and he's not shifting the plane. Paul is
[56:32] not saying, "I'm not responsible." You
[56:34] know, there's people that that that that
[56:36] that that you know, they're they're
[56:39] caught in a trap. They're caught in sin
[56:41] and they want to blame someone else for
[56:44] their problems, but it's they're the
[56:47] ones who did it.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; You're the one at fault.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not your mom's fault. It's
[56:52] not your dad's fault. It's not the
[56:53] pastor's fault. It's you. The problem is
[56:56] with you. Amen. So, you have to look
[56:58] deep within. Amen. Where the problem is
[57:00] lying. And so the real enemy is deeper
[57:03] than behavior. It's a power or law
[57:06] within your flesh or spirit. Amen.
[57:10] Because we're we have that law in there
[57:12] that we're con until we get the body
[57:14] change, saints, we're going to have a
[57:16] law, amen, in there wrestling with us,
[57:19] &gt;&gt; wrestling us. Just because you have the
[57:21] Holy Ghost, Amen. does not mean that you
[57:24] don't get tempted to look at a a woman
[57:27] that's half-dressed out here in the
[57:28] street. All right.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Just because you have the Holy Ghost
[57:32] doesn't mean that another man can catch
[57:35] your attention, sisters.
[57:37] Amen. Just because you have the Holy
[57:40] Ghost doesn't mean I'm going to that you
[57:42] won't get tempted to cheat on your
[57:43] taxes. Tax season coming around now.
[57:50] Just because you have a go Holy Ghost
[57:52] doesn't mean you're not going to get
[57:53] tempted with the music that you used to
[57:55] listen to. Right?
[57:57] &gt;&gt; When you go out to the stores and you go
[57:59] out and listen to in the restaurants and
[58:01] you're there with your family trying to
[58:03] enjoy time and all of a sudden that song
[58:05] from the '9s starts coming. Oh,
[58:08] Backstreet Boy. [laughter]
[58:13] And then and then all of a sudden the
[58:15] the lyrics come and you're not you were
[58:17] not even thinking of that song. Why?
[58:20] Because all that's built into your
[58:22] subconscious in that sinful nature.
[58:25] Amen. And that's where your where your
[58:27] soul what what God has done in you.
[58:29] Amen. Comes and has to rise up. When the
[58:32] when the enemy comes, the spirit of God
[58:34] raises up a standard. The Bible says,
[58:36] amen.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; That's when you have to fight.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And say, I'll squash this
[58:43] &gt;&gt; because I know where this will lead me.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[58:48] So knowing this, knowing this, it will
[58:50] help you to depend on God for strength
[58:53] and victory and not yourself.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; All right?
[58:57] &gt;&gt; So this helps you to know that it's God
[59:00] that's going to do this for me, not you
[59:02] yourself. Not nothing that you can do.
[59:05] You can't repent too much. You can't you
[59:07] can't cry too much. You can't come and
[59:10] get your hands laid upon here uh too
[59:12] much and and think that I'm gonna fix it
[59:15] somehow or the pastor's going to fix it
[59:17] somehow. No, it's got to be God and God
[59:20] only. Amen.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; You've had to depend on him. Amen. That
[59:24] he will take care of it. Praise God.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Because he ultimately he's the one who
[59:29] gets the glory.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; If it was something that you could do,
[59:33] then you would get the glory.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; But there's nothing that you and I can
[59:38] do. when you have fallen into and and
[59:42] and made a mistake or you've done
[59:43] something wrong. Amen. That's the time
[59:46] for you to come back to him.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Not to get away from him further. No,
[59:52] come back.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Because if you want restoration, if God
[59:56] has already started a work in you,
[59:58] you'll desire restoration.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] Praise God.
[1:00:03] So God's going to make sure God's going
[1:00:05] to make sure to get the glory through
[1:00:06] your struggle. You know, let me just
[1:00:08] talk to your parents. I put there
[1:00:10] raising children for a moment because
[1:00:14] you know sometimes as as uses that that
[1:00:17] we've raised children and we were
[1:00:18] talking to to some couples there in in
[1:00:20] in in Canada how they're going through
[1:00:24] stages right now where they're raising
[1:00:26] starting to raise teenage children and
[1:00:28] their children now are coming to a point
[1:00:30] where they're they're they're they're
[1:00:32] they're getting uh their own their own
[1:00:35] opinions about things now about how I
[1:00:38] should
[1:00:39] How about about even political things,
[1:00:42] even societal things and their own opin
[1:00:45] and then it almost leaves the the parent
[1:00:47] flabbergasted now. Wow, they have their
[1:00:50] own opinion about things now. Yeah, you
[1:00:53] did too.
[1:00:56] You did too. They start forming their
[1:00:58] own opinion about life, right? Because
[1:01:01] they're in the middle of trying to
[1:01:03] search out God for themselves.
[1:01:06] See, you can only take them to a certain
[1:01:09] point.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then God has to start dealing
[1:01:12] with them. But that is the time for you
[1:01:14] to just go ahead. The Lord, when I came
[1:01:16] and I brought him here to be dedicated
[1:01:18] to you when they were a little babies,
[1:01:20] it wasn't for me to hold him by the hand
[1:01:22] the rest of my life.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; No, it was for me to hold them until a
[1:01:27] certain point and then give them over to
[1:01:29] you. Amen. So that you can let them go.
[1:01:31] So that they can you can lead them the
[1:01:33] rest of the way.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:36] Amen.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; And so I told the brother, I said,
[1:01:39] because you know, the the the he's he's
[1:01:42] having to go through that and it's very
[1:01:44] it's very uh it's daunting to them
[1:01:46] because the parents were raised in the
[1:01:48] message and and now these kids, Amen.
[1:01:51] That's that's all they've known is the
[1:01:53] message and they don't know anything
[1:01:55] else.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; And because they don't know anything
[1:01:57] else, that's why the world is so much
[1:01:59] attractive to them.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; You see, cuz they haven't kissed a boy.
[1:02:03] They haven't kissed a girl. They haven't
[1:02:05] done no things like that like you did
[1:02:08] when you were out in the world. If you g
[1:02:11] if if if you if you were out in the
[1:02:13] world, I was one of them.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; I didn't grow up in the message,
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; right? So then you wonder, well, why is
[1:02:20] it that they're not do they're not doing
[1:02:22] it the way I I I came up? Amen. But do
[1:02:25] you have to understand that they have to
[1:02:27] have their own experience with God?
[1:02:31] You see, and you can't stop that. You
[1:02:34] can't hinder that because everything is
[1:02:36] going to work together for the good.
[1:02:38] Amen. You can only be a light. You can
[1:02:41] guide them. Be there for them. Be a
[1:02:43] friend to them. Share. Share. You live
[1:02:45] the gospel before them
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; so that they can be thirsty. Be salty
[1:02:50] before them. Amen. Praise God. And I
[1:02:52] told her the brother, I said, 'Listen,
[1:02:54] if if you raised them up, let's say you
[1:02:56] raised your kids up and and they did
[1:02:59] everything right,
[1:03:01] and I don't know what parent wouldn't
[1:03:03] want that. [laughter]
[1:03:05] We would love for our kids to do
[1:03:07] everything right, serve the Lord, get
[1:03:09] up, get up uh get up from bed on time,
[1:03:12] go to school, do all their homework, and
[1:03:15] do everything. Amen. Us not have to say
[1:03:18] nothing to them.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; It would be so wonderful.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. But let's say they did everything
[1:03:23] right.
[1:03:25] Amen. Because they listened to you every
[1:03:27] time you told them, "Do it this way. Do
[1:03:29] it this way. Okay, mommy, I'll do it
[1:03:31] that way." And they do it. That's
[1:03:34] wonderful. But at the end, you're the
[1:03:38] one who's going to end up getting the
[1:03:39] glory and not God. Right.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; But when it's God, when it's them
[1:03:45] messing up their lives and them and them
[1:03:49] and them falling into the deepest pits
[1:03:52] where you can't really do anything,
[1:03:54] amen, to take them out yourself, but
[1:03:56] it's got to be God.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Then God will get the glory then because
[1:04:01] God's the only one who can take him out.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I told that to a brother there in
[1:04:07] Canada and he it kind of he didn't he it
[1:04:10] shocked him. He didn't really see it
[1:04:12] that way before. I hope that helped him.
[1:04:15] Amen.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; So, we have to see our children. Amen.
[1:04:19] The way we raise them, it it has to take
[1:04:20] God. Amen. Have confidence that God is
[1:04:23] doing the work in them. They might be
[1:04:25] the rebellious kids right now, but have
[1:04:29] confidence that God is taking that
[1:04:30] rebellion and turning it into something
[1:04:32] good.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're listening to the word. So
[1:04:36] the seed's coming in there and that
[1:04:39] seed's going to produce life someday.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. I'm so glad for
[1:04:44] that. So think of it like this there and
[1:04:48] we still in Romans 7 that if if if
[1:04:50] recognizing the disease is what drives
[1:04:53] you to seek the cure, right? If you're
[1:04:56] not if you don't feel sick or if you're
[1:04:58] not if you're not uh know that you're
[1:05:01] sick, then you won't recognize that you
[1:05:03] need a cure,
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we we we instead of us
[1:05:08] maintaining like brother Aaron was
[1:05:10] talking about on Wednesday, maintaining
[1:05:12] with supplements, vitamins, uh things
[1:05:15] like that because we are so deficient in
[1:05:17] in in in our soil is not the way it used
[1:05:20] to be anymore. Our food is totally
[1:05:22] hybridized. Uh and if you want to buy
[1:05:25] good food, you better you're gonna pay a
[1:05:27] a pretty penny for it. When at some at
[1:05:30] one point in life, it was just it was
[1:05:31] just free. It was just uh that's how
[1:05:34] food was always. Now a McDonald's burger
[1:05:38] I is cheap, but it's not probably not
[1:05:42] good for you. [laughter]
[1:05:44] Not like a a a chicken sandwich made
[1:05:46] from a a a bread that was traditionally
[1:05:50] made and and and chicken that was
[1:05:53] pasture-raised.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; That's probably much better, right? or
[1:05:59] beef that was grass-fed or something
[1:06:01] like that, right? But but you see, so if
[1:06:05] you're not So we're got we're having to
[1:06:07] to supplement now. And and because
[1:06:10] sometimes we don't supplement or
[1:06:12] sometimes we don't maintain, amen, our
[1:06:14] health, then we go running for the the
[1:06:18] medicine cabinet when we get sick.
[1:06:21] Right?
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; But it's too late then because now your
[1:06:23] body is telling you uh out outwardly
[1:06:26] there's something wrong inwardly. So
[1:06:29] that's why you're dripping and you're
[1:06:31] you're sneezing now and and your eyes
[1:06:33] are all puffy and and your skin itches
[1:06:36] now. It's because the body is trying to
[1:06:38] tell you it's trying to fight something
[1:06:41] that has invaded your body. Right.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; But if we if we help maintain Amen. And
[1:06:47] so going back to the spiritual, Amen.
[1:06:50] Recognizing the disease is what drives
[1:06:53] you to to seek the cure. Recognize that
[1:06:55] you have a spiritual disease.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Then you can recognize that you can go
[1:07:02] to the healer. Amen. For that spiritual
[1:07:04] disease.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Then you know who is who is your healer.
[1:07:07] Praise God.
[1:07:09] So, I'm so glad that there in in in that
[1:07:12] scripture in Romans 7, Paul says, "Oh,
[1:07:15] what a miserable person I am. Who will
[1:07:18] free me from this life that is dominated
[1:07:20] by sin and death?" But he says, here's
[1:07:23] the answer he gives. But thank God, the
[1:07:25] answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:07:31] Now, I want us to get here to something
[1:07:34] real quick. And I'm trying to go quickly
[1:07:35] cuz I have several slides and I
[1:07:37] apologize for for going too quick but I
[1:07:40] don't want to keep you keep you all here
[1:07:43] uh for forever. All right. So
[1:07:48] your question may be, have I sinned too
[1:07:50] far in 2025?
[1:07:53] Have I gone too far? Have I done so
[1:07:54] much? Amen. That that that that God
[1:07:57] won't restore me. God won't. And this is
[1:08:01] a question that a lady asked brother
[1:08:02] Brandham in the message uh question and
[1:08:04] answers in 1962.
[1:08:07] And he says here she the question is I
[1:08:10] lived many years in sin until I found
[1:08:12] the Lord. Please brother Brandham I have
[1:08:14] sinned again and I am not worthy not
[1:08:17] worthy to come before you in this holy
[1:08:19] place.
[1:08:21] Please tell me if I can be restored holy
[1:08:24] again. Please help me brother Brandham.
[1:08:27] I have a devil in me.
[1:08:30] Help me. Will you lay your hands upon me
[1:08:32] and restore me again?
[1:08:36] It was a sincere question. And most of
[1:08:38] us, what we'd do, we'd probably throw
[1:08:40] this woman out
[1:08:42] by our legalistic ways.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; We thought you you did it again. You
[1:08:47] ain't coming back in here anymore.
[1:08:50] You You You're putting that on again.
[1:08:52] You ain't coming You ain't coming back
[1:08:54] in here anymore. you you have your hair
[1:08:56] like that again, you ain't coming back
[1:08:58] in here anymore. But you see this woman,
[1:09:01] Amen, she recognized that she was in the
[1:09:03] wrong and all she wants is grace and
[1:09:06] help. And so she's asking a person who
[1:09:11] who had the vindication of God during
[1:09:13] that time, the prophet of God, brother
[1:09:16] Brandham, help me, lay hands on me. I
[1:09:18] have a devil in me. She recognized that
[1:09:20] she had a disease.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Right? And that's the first step for you
[1:09:25] to be right. You're already right when
[1:09:27] you recognize that.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you don't recognize it at
[1:09:31] all, then you're not you're not right at
[1:09:33] all.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; But when you recognize, I have a
[1:09:36] problem. I need help. You're on your
[1:09:38] road to recovery.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And look what Brother Brandham
[1:09:44] says with a resounding no.
[1:09:47] No, that's not what he says. He says
[1:09:50] yes.
[1:09:52] Yes, you have not sinned, my friend, so
[1:09:56] far in God, but what you could be
[1:09:59] restored.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; If you had sinned so far that you could
[1:10:04] not be restored, I want you to listen to
[1:10:06] this. If you had sinned so far that you
[1:10:10] could not be restored, you'd never want
[1:10:12] to be restored.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Right? The fact that she was asking
[1:10:17] brother Brandham, "Brother Brandom, I
[1:10:19] want to be restored. I want help. I need
[1:10:21] help. That's because there was
[1:10:23] restoration there for her.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, see, but as long as there
[1:10:30] is something dealing in your heart,
[1:10:33] you're still in line of restoration.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God. As long as God God doesn't
[1:10:41] leave you alone. Amen.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; No matter how deep you might have gotten
[1:10:45] in the world, no matter how how deep
[1:10:47] you've gotten in sin, Amen. If you're a
[1:10:49] son and daughter of God, God's not going
[1:10:51] to lose you. Amen. He said, "I will not
[1:10:53] lose not one."
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I was out in the world, Amen.
[1:10:59] I knew better. I didn't grow up in this
[1:11:01] message, but I was a Baptist at the
[1:11:03] time. And when I was out there drinking
[1:11:06] and smoking and carrying on with girls
[1:11:08] and things like that, amen. Deep down
[1:11:10] inside my heart, something kept tugging
[1:11:12] me, kept tugging at me. You're you're
[1:11:14] you're wrong. You're wrong. You're
[1:11:16] wrong. And I could not just live a happy
[1:11:20] worldly life.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; I just couldn't.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; And so I had to just give in to God's
[1:11:30] one day and say, "Lord, I can't I'm
[1:11:32] miserable even in the world.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Trying to live like a worldly person."
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; And then that's when God gave me peace.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; When I gave it all over to him. You're
[1:11:44] not going to have true peace until you
[1:11:45] really give over to give your life over
[1:11:48] to him, saints.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham keeps saying, he says,
[1:11:54] "If you had sinned so far that you could
[1:11:56] not be restored, you never want to be
[1:11:58] restored." See, but as long as there is
[1:12:00] something dealing with your heart,
[1:12:02] you're still in line of restoration.
[1:12:04] Guilty of the least is guilty of the
[1:12:06] whole.
[1:12:08] I have sinned many times. Look, Brother
[1:12:10] Brandham said, "I have sinned many
[1:12:12] times." Wow.
[1:12:14] Some of us live life like brother
[1:12:16] Brandham didn't make a mistake. But he
[1:12:18] says right here, I have sinned many
[1:12:20] times.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; I have sinned many times. Every day.
[1:12:23] Every every day. Every one of us do
[1:12:26] things that we don't want to do.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; The prophet saying that.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Oh no. The prophet was holy. He did not
[1:12:35] make a mistake. I beg your pardon. He
[1:12:37] was a sinner saved by grace
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; just like you and I. He needed just as
[1:12:42] much grace as you and I did.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; You see, it's in our heart. And that's
[1:12:51] what we were talking about there from
[1:12:52] Romans 7. You don't want to be that way.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; He's he's he's answering this woman's
[1:12:59] question. You don't want to be that way
[1:13:01] or you wouldn't ask this question
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; because a person who does doesn't does
[1:13:06] doesn't want to change wouldn't care any
[1:13:07] anything about
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; and writing a question down like that
[1:13:12] right taking their time that's itself a
[1:13:15] proof that God is still dealing with you
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; oh my this ain't this ain't deep but
[1:13:21] it's deep [laughter]
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; you've probably gotten nervous probably
[1:13:27] Satan telling you that you can't be
[1:13:29] restored Lord, he's lying. Certainly, he
[1:13:32] is. See? Amen. Because look, if there is
[1:13:36] a deep calling, there's got to be a deep
[1:13:39] to respond to the call.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; I'll just let brother Brandham say it.
[1:13:44] If there's a hunger for something, that
[1:13:47] something's got to be somewhere or you
[1:13:50] would you would have no hunger for it.
[1:13:53] Amen.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; So the res that means [snorts] that the
[1:13:56] restoration or God who restores had to
[1:14:00] be there first before she could hunger
[1:14:03] for that.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Praise God.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there. So in order you want to
[1:14:09] be right, you want to come back to God,
[1:14:11] but what are you coming to? It's because
[1:14:13] something's drawing you.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And in John 6:65 it
[1:14:21] says, "Therefore said Jesus is saying
[1:14:23] because Jesus didn't save you to lose
[1:14:25] you."
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "Therefore said I unto you that
[1:14:29] no man can come unto me except it were
[1:14:32] given unto him of my father."
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God that draws. It's God that
[1:14:39] does the drawing. Amen. Praise the Lord
[1:14:41] Jesus.
[1:14:43] He also said in John 10:28, he said,
[1:14:46] "And I give unto them eternal life, and
[1:14:50] they shall never, never." Everybody say,
[1:14:54] "Never."
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; All right, you're awake. They shall
[1:14:58] never perish. Neither shall any man
[1:15:01] pluck them out of my hand.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus said that. So, if you've come to
[1:15:07] God and you've received the Holy Ghost
[1:15:09] and you've been born again, but you've
[1:15:12] fallen fallen, you know, you've backslid
[1:15:15] or you or you or you or you kind of got
[1:15:18] cold on God. Amen. And and and
[1:15:21] Amen. God said he won't lose you.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now, we'll read here just a
[1:15:29] moment something that Brother Brandham
[1:15:30] said, but Jesus keeps going. He says,
[1:15:33] "My father which gave them me is greater
[1:15:36] than all and no man is able to plug them
[1:15:39] out of my father's hand."
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, the grace of God. See, when Jesus
[1:15:44] was saying this, he wasn't saying that
[1:15:46] they will never make mistakes ever
[1:15:48] again.
[1:15:51] He knows because of your humanity and
[1:15:53] the law that's within you, right, of
[1:15:56] sin. But he said, "I'll they'll never
[1:15:58] perish." Why? Because they're going to
[1:16:00] keep repenting. They're going to keep
[1:16:02] they're going to keep needing my grace.
[1:16:04] They're going to keep desiring my blood.
[1:16:06] Amen. Praise God. Now, that's not a sin.
[1:16:10] That's not a license for you to just
[1:16:11] keep doing doing things, bad things, and
[1:16:14] and keep sinning. No. Amen. As we just
[1:16:17] talked about, shall we make grace, Amen,
[1:16:20] disgrace, as Paul said.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:16:26] Now, brother Bram says here and speaking
[1:16:29] about that Jesus didn't save you to lose
[1:16:32] you. Amen. How could he save something
[1:16:34] that that later on he's going to lose?
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Then he he's not God.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Because he can't lose anything that he
[1:16:45] knows.
[1:16:47] [laughter]
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; And he's known you. Amen. Before the
[1:16:50] foundation of the world. Praise God. So
[1:16:53] he can't lose anything that belongs to
[1:16:56] him. Amen. When when when you know where
[1:16:59] you've put something.
[1:17:01] Amen. Some of us who have uh you know
[1:17:04] kids who who where is my where is my
[1:17:07] shoe? Well, it's where you last put it.
[1:17:09] I don't know.
[1:17:11] I had them here and and
[1:17:14] Oh, they were they were in the basement.
[1:17:19] I didn't put them there.
[1:17:22] But you see, it's not with God that way.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; God cannot lose what he already knows.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; It's not that way with God. Even though
[1:17:33] you may get all tangled up like that,
[1:17:36] like that visual we just saw. Amen. He
[1:17:38] knows exactly where you're at.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; See, when Adam sinned, Amen. He It
[1:17:43] wasn't that he was asking Adam, Adam,
[1:17:46] Adam, where are you? I don't know where
[1:17:48] you are. Where are you? Are you behind
[1:17:49] here? Are you behind this bush? God knew
[1:17:52] exactly where Adam was.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; He just wanted Adam to recognize where
[1:17:57] he was at.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; When you recognize where you're at, then
[1:18:01] you're you're in line for help.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. [applause]
[1:18:07] You're in line for help. Amen. God knows
[1:18:11] exactly your heart.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; God knows why you're here this morning.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; God knows, Amen. exactly where your
[1:18:17] heart is right now. If it's on the
[1:18:19] Georgia Bulldog game right now, or if
[1:18:21] it's on God,
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; if it's on the pot of beans that you
[1:18:24] have at home, or if it's on God, or if
[1:18:27] it's on your children, amen, who are not
[1:18:29] living worthy, or if it's on God. Amen.
[1:18:32] Praise God. God knows exactly where
[1:18:36] where you where where where where
[1:18:38] your heart is.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Because where your heart is, there there
[1:18:42] your treasures will be also.
[1:18:45] Now before brother Brandon keeps saying
[1:18:47] here brother now before there can be a
[1:18:49] creation there has to be a creator to
[1:18:51] create the creation. See what I mean?
[1:18:54] Now as long as you are wanting and
[1:18:58] hungering to get back to God remember
[1:19:01] this is a new year. There's a God
[1:19:04] somewhere calling to you. See or you
[1:19:08] wouldn't be hungering.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; There's a creator. Brother Brandham says
[1:19:15] now if you there is a place that you can
[1:19:17] cross where you can't get back. But when
[1:19:20] that is your when when that is you're
[1:19:23] down there again in the same shape you
[1:19:25] was in other words it's a it's a cycle.
[1:19:29] Amen. It goes to show that you only fell
[1:19:31] from grace.
[1:19:34] You can get back into that grace
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; because that grace is still calling out.
[1:19:38] Amen.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; It's crying out grace. grace.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, look what brother
[1:19:45] Brandham says here. He says,
[1:19:47] "Backsliding is not lost."
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, that brother backslid. I tell you
[1:19:53] what, he just doesn't come to church
[1:19:55] anymore. Or that sister doesn't come to
[1:19:57] she and him or she or him are backslid.
[1:20:01] Amen. Brother Brandon says backsliding
[1:20:03] is not lost.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; He said it. Do we believe he's a
[1:20:08] prophet?
[1:20:11] See, because us and our nature, we just
[1:20:13] want to throw everybody out.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, they just don't do it the way I
[1:20:18] think they should do it. They don't come
[1:20:20] the way they don't come to church every
[1:20:22] single service the way I do it.
[1:20:27] I'm They're not [snorts]
[1:20:31] [sighs and gasps]
[1:20:32] They're not in my in my circle.
[1:20:36] You'd be surprised who's going to be in
[1:20:38] heaven that day
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; and who won't be in heaven.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says backsliding is not
[1:20:45] lost. I want somebody to tell me where
[1:20:48] backsliding is lost and prove it to me
[1:20:51] by the Bible. Brother Brandham says
[1:20:54] backslider is not lost. He says he's
[1:20:57] just out of fellowship.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:21:02] We can go deeper into that, but maybe at
[1:21:05] another time. Israel backslid, but they
[1:21:07] never lost their covenant.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Right? When brother Brand when when the
[1:21:12] Lord told Israel that I've given you a
[1:21:15] land flowing with milk and honey, that
[1:21:17] never that promise never was taken away
[1:21:20] from them. No matter how many times they
[1:21:22] got down to worship Baal,
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:28] No matter how many times they laid with
[1:21:30] prostitute women and and married other
[1:21:32] people and and and and that promise was
[1:21:35] still that promise was still there
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; and they could come back to back to that
[1:21:41] promise and align themselves back to
[1:21:44] that. Amen.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; They lost their their praises and joy.
[1:21:50] And we'll talk about joy here in a
[1:21:51] moment. David lost the joy of his
[1:21:54] salvation.
[1:21:56] See, when he took Bethshea, Uriah's
[1:21:59] wife, but he never lost his salvation.
[1:22:02] This is your prophet speaking. This is
[1:22:04] not me. I didn't write this down. This
[1:22:06] is your prophet saying this.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; All right. And and for us to for us to
[1:22:11] to to not show the grace that our own
[1:22:14] prophet showed in this hour. Amen.
[1:22:17] That's a disgrace within itself.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; If the prophet was so gracious, Amen.
[1:22:25] Amen. How how much more should we be in
[1:22:27] this hour when the copstone is crying
[1:22:29] grace, grace.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. He never said, David never said,
[1:22:36] "Restore to me," this is still brother
[1:22:38] Brandham speaking, "Restore to me my
[1:22:40] salvation." David never said that when
[1:22:42] we were in the scripture we just read.
[1:22:44] He said, "Restore to me the joy of my
[1:22:47] salvation."
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; All right? And we'll talk about that
[1:22:49] here in a moment. Oh, there's so much of
[1:22:51] this legalism today. Hey, brother
[1:22:53] Brandham says, "Oh my, we find it." And
[1:22:56] let me tell you, in Latin America, you
[1:22:58] find it a lot. I'm I'm a Latin I'm a
[1:23:01] Latino and we just we're just macho and
[1:23:04] and and and we're legalists.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; We don't say we are, but our actions
[1:23:09] show that we are.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; And I I you see it there in in the
[1:23:14] countries and you know, the man doesn't
[1:23:17] go in the kitchen at all. Doesn't do
[1:23:20] anything in the kitchen. That's the
[1:23:21] woman's job.
[1:23:26] You're supposed to, you know, what, you
[1:23:29] know, sweetheart, and and you know,
[1:23:31] they'll say, "Sweetheart, you know, I'm
[1:23:34] hungry."
[1:23:35] And and and she's over there, you know,
[1:23:37] she's she's she's dealing with the with
[1:23:39] the babies that you help bring into this
[1:23:41] world, by the way.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; She's over there dealing, oh, okay,
[1:23:44] honey, I'm coming. I'm coming. You know
[1:23:46] how to go into in the fridge and make
[1:23:48] yourself a sandwich.
[1:23:51] or you didn't learn that
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; then that was your mom's fault then.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; we're not too big. A man is not too big
[1:24:02] to not go in and wash dishes. Brother
[1:24:04] Brandham went in and put on an apron and
[1:24:06] wash dishes.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, this ain't the seals,
[1:24:13] but it's deep.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, because some of us, we don't
[1:24:19] like that. We're we're too Latino. We're
[1:24:21] too we're too macho. You know, we're
[1:24:22] too, you know, we like legalism. See,
[1:24:25] and Brother Brandham says there's so
[1:24:27] much of this legalism today. The touch
[1:24:30] not, taste not. You don't do things
[1:24:32] legally. Brother Brandham says,
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; I want you to get that because let me
[1:24:39] tell you, this legalism is rising back
[1:24:41] up again.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; And you see it in the political world
[1:24:46] and you also see it in the spiritual
[1:24:47] world. All
[1:24:48] right. It's what it's what you can do,
[1:24:51] but it's not what you can do. It's what
[1:24:54] he's done.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:57] Now, David says uh in Psalms 51:12, it
[1:25:00] says, uh, "Restore unto me the joy of
[1:25:04] thy salvation,
[1:25:06] and uphold me with thy free spirit."
[1:25:09] Amen. Now,
[1:25:12] we often times we confuse losing our joy
[1:25:15] with losing our salvation. when we do
[1:25:18] wrong.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; But you see as that brother Brandham
[1:25:21] just said, you you have not lost your
[1:25:22] salvation.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; How can God lose something when he has
[1:25:26] already saved it that he didn't really
[1:25:29] lose,
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Okay. The prod now watch this. The
[1:25:34] prodigal son, this is this is my notes.
[1:25:37] The prodigal son only lost his joy. He
[1:25:41] did not lose his identity.
[1:25:44] He still had a father to come back to
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; when he was out and and and and and
[1:25:51] drinking and and and and took the the
[1:25:53] the the everything the the the money
[1:25:56] from his father and and and went out and
[1:25:59] and and spended it all and on righteous
[1:26:02] living on righteous living and and lived
[1:26:04] with women and done and then all and
[1:26:06] then he's back in with pigs eating what
[1:26:09] they were eating. Amen. He within
[1:26:12] himself he was out of he was out of
[1:26:14] line. Amen. But within himself he knew
[1:26:17] that he could go back to the father.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; He knew that he had a father that he can
[1:26:22] come back to.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like that song, I have a
[1:26:27] father.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; He knows my name.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. So he he
[1:26:33] just lost his joy because see when you
[1:26:36] lose your joy Amen. your joy. And we'll
[1:26:39] talk about this here in a moment. We
[1:26:40] we'll get to it.
[1:26:43] When you lose your joy, Amen. you're
[1:26:45] losing it. Amen. That zeal that you have
[1:26:48] for God, and you're putting it into
[1:26:49] something else. Amen.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; And in the case of the of the of the of
[1:26:54] the of the uh the prodigal son, he lost
[1:26:58] his joy in serving God or he lost his
[1:27:02] joy in what he was doing growing up
[1:27:05] under the supervision and the guidance
[1:27:07] of his father and putting it into
[1:27:09] something else.
[1:27:12] And when you do that, Amen. then that's
[1:27:15] when you begin to lose your joy. And
[1:27:16] that's when you begin to backslide. And
[1:27:18] that's when you begin. When you put
[1:27:20] something else before God,
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; that's you putting everything, your
[1:27:24] zeal, your passion, your focus, your joy
[1:27:27] into that instead of God. And then you
[1:27:31] wonder, where am I, Lord? What has
[1:27:34] happened a year, a year later? It's
[1:27:38] because you lost your focus. You lost
[1:27:41] your joy. Amen.
[1:27:44] And so what we want to do is we want to
[1:27:47] say we want to say um oh I I need to get
[1:27:51] saved again. I need to get rebaptized
[1:27:54] again. I need to I need to repent. I I
[1:27:57] you do need to repent but I I need to do
[1:28:00] everything over again. And and and in
[1:28:02] reality you don't.
[1:28:04] All you need to do is see what robbed
[1:28:07] you of your joy and work from there.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; And start from there. What is
[1:28:14] captivating you more than God?
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Right now, we live in this life. We're
[1:28:21] going to have our jobs. We're going to
[1:28:23] do things. We're going to we're going to
[1:28:25] go out. We're going to travel. We're
[1:28:27] going to We have to live life. But what
[1:28:30] is priority before everything is God.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; I always have God in the forefront,
[1:28:36] right? Everything else is secondary. And
[1:28:39] God is not telling you you can't you
[1:28:41] can't do this. You can't go out. you
[1:28:43] can't you can't have this membership.
[1:28:45] You can't do this. No, no, no. God is
[1:28:47] not saying that. But God is saying, "Put
[1:28:49] everything. Put me first
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; and then all these other things, they
[1:28:55] will be added unto you."
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; And they and even sometimes in
[1:28:59] abundance.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; So let's look at the difference between
[1:29:04] joy and happiness for a moment.
[1:29:06] Happiness is usually I want you to pay
[1:29:09] attention to this because sometimes we
[1:29:10] confuse happiness and joy.
[1:29:13] Happiness is usually tied to
[1:29:15] circumstances.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; See the word itself is related to
[1:29:19] happen.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Happiness happen right and it comes from
[1:29:25] what happens.
[1:29:27] It changes quickly. It depends on
[1:29:30] comfort, success, health or outcomes,
[1:29:34] right? It depends on, you know, if if if
[1:29:36] I got a if I got a bonus at the end of
[1:29:38] the year, I'm happy
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; at my job.
[1:29:42] Oh, I didn't get a bonus this year. I
[1:29:46] don't know if I'm going to serve God
[1:29:47] this coming year.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; See, that that's happiness. It it
[1:29:52] changes. It fluctuates back and forth.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Right. It's not constant, right? And it
[1:29:58] can disappear when life gets hard.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; That's that's happiness.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Now, we all like to be happy, right?
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; I like to see you all happy when I come
[1:30:08] to church,
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; but I know that can change.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because sometimes you might come
[1:30:12] in grumpy,
[1:30:14] but I'm not going to I'm not going to
[1:30:16] look at you and say, "He's just a grumpy
[1:30:19] old man all the time." No. Something may
[1:30:22] have caused to change that happiness.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Something back home or your children or
[1:30:26] or something happened at your job or or
[1:30:28] or something, right? But I know within
[1:30:32] yourself, you're not that way, right?
[1:30:34] And that's where joy comes in, right?
[1:30:36] Joy is deeper and more stable,
[1:30:40] right? It comes from who you trust,
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; not what happens around you.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; All right? So the externals don't change
[1:30:50] the joy. Right? It exists alongside
[1:30:54] pain, sorrow, or struggle. In other
[1:30:56] words, you can have hard times, but joy
[1:30:58] is still there.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe happiness won't be, but joy
[1:31:04] is still there.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Right? It's rooted in hope, meaning, and
[1:31:10] relationship with God. Amen. And it
[1:31:13] endures even when circumstances are
[1:31:15] difficult.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Right? So joy is something stable. So
[1:31:19] you can think of it like this. Happiness
[1:31:21] is like the weather. It changes.
[1:31:26] And my we live in Georgia and that
[1:31:28] happens all the time.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; At least in Canada, you know what you're
[1:31:32] going to get.
[1:31:34] in Georgia. You just don't know.
[1:31:38] My goodness. I feel like I have long
[1:31:39] hair that I keep doing this. I don't
[1:31:43] know if I like this.
[1:31:47] My my
[1:31:51] But joy joy is like the climate. It's
[1:31:54] like climate. It shapes the environment
[1:31:57] long term.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Right. It shapes your environment long
[1:32:01] term. So that's the difference between
[1:32:04] joy and happiness.
[1:32:06] And hey, if you if you if you want these
[1:32:09] these uh these slides, I'll be more than
[1:32:12] glad to share them with you. Anybody can
[1:32:14] have our notes are not proprietary to
[1:32:16] us. Amen. You can have all these notes
[1:32:19] yourself. Amen. Because that's it's
[1:32:21] God's word. Amen.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; If you can go if you want to go back and
[1:32:25] read read through them. Now in Nehemiah
[1:32:27] 8:10, the Bible says, "Then he said unto
[1:32:30] them, go your way, eat the fat, and
[1:32:32] drink the sweet, and send portions unto
[1:32:34] them, for whom nothing is prepared, for
[1:32:37] this day is holy unto our Lord, neither
[1:32:39] be ye sorry, for the joy of the Lord is
[1:32:43] what?
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Your strength."
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; And that's where we get, amen, the song,
[1:32:47] the joy of the Lord is my strength. But
[1:32:49] this is where the verse comes from. For
[1:32:52] the joy of the Lord is your strength.
[1:32:54] Now remember, joy is something constant.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; All right? And that is one of that is
[1:33:00] what that is what's going to give you
[1:33:01] strength to move forward. To conquer
[1:33:05] this year like you've never conquered
[1:33:06] any other years before,
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; right? To grow spiritually like you've
[1:33:11] never grown spiritually before.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; To overcome that habit like you've never
[1:33:16] overcome that before.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is to maintain joy. And what is
[1:33:22] joy? being focused and being happy about
[1:33:24] serving God.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz when you lose that and you put it
[1:33:28] all on Netflix, Amen. you've lost joy.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Now Netflix has got your joy or
[1:33:34] YouTube's got your joy or something
[1:33:36] else, Instagram or Deepop or whatever.
[1:33:38] Everything that's out there now, it's
[1:33:40] gotten your joy. Now,
[1:33:43] God wants you to be joyous
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; so that you can could so that you can
[1:33:47] have strength. And if you don't know
[1:33:49] whatop is, it's a selling platform where
[1:33:52] people are getting on there selling
[1:33:53] things now. Kind of like am Amazon a
[1:33:56] little bit.
[1:33:59] How do we lose our joy then?
[1:34:02] that if you take the joy of the Lord and
[1:34:04] put it in something else, as we've been
[1:34:05] talking, put in your joy and focus on
[1:34:07] other things instead of God and his
[1:34:10] word, your job,
[1:34:14] friends,
[1:34:15] family.
[1:34:17] See, all these things, they're not bad,
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; but your focus is on that.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Your family is more important to come to
[1:34:25] church.
[1:34:27] You've lost your joy.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; It's hard to say.
[1:34:32] your career.
[1:34:36] Well, I have to work
[1:34:38] on Sundays, but you know that there's an
[1:34:41] option for you not to have to
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; but you don't take it. You've lost your
[1:34:46] joy.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Your house. Oh, some of us are concerned
[1:34:50] about our house.
[1:34:52] Our house and our house can become a
[1:34:54] focus.
[1:34:57] All right. That can make you lose your
[1:34:59] joy. Your pet. Oh my I saw the other
[1:35:03] day, you know, the other day it it was
[1:35:06] the most pitiful sight and I just
[1:35:08] couldn't help to think what brother
[1:35:09] Brandham said that in this day that even
[1:35:12] in that day, you know, that women would
[1:35:14] prefer to just have a pet, have a dog
[1:35:18] instead of getting married and have
[1:35:19] babies and things like that. and and and
[1:35:22] and it was it was a it was a I mean they
[1:35:24] they they they put like diapers on their
[1:35:27] pets and stuff now and they put them in
[1:35:29] strollers
[1:35:31] and and going around in the mall
[1:35:35] and the and the dog the poor dog's in
[1:35:37] there. [laughter]
[1:35:41] You got the poor dog's in there, you
[1:35:43] know, like wondering what in the world
[1:35:47] they got him in strollers now.
[1:35:51] you, you know, uh, and so we can we can
[1:35:54] consume ourselves with our pets so much
[1:35:57] that we don't come to church because
[1:35:59] they're sick.
[1:36:01] You lost your joy then.
[1:36:05] Or we can consume oursel with our
[1:36:07] investments.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; All right? Don't put anything before
[1:36:12] God. Brother Brandham says here, he
[1:36:14] says, listen to this quote. I know I'm
[1:36:17] reading a lot. Amen.
[1:36:20] It's deep though
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; and we all need this.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, that's just for the young
[1:36:25] people. I thought you were a young
[1:36:26] person too
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; at heart."
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; No, this is for all of us.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Why do you hunger, church? Why do you
[1:36:34] thirst? This is brother Brandon. Christ
[1:36:36] is the mystery of God revealed after he
[1:36:38] preached the seals. He says, "It's the
[1:36:41] father trying to reveal this hidden
[1:36:43] secret to you." But watch what he says.
[1:36:46] But you let so many things get it out of
[1:36:49] you.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; You let your job, you let your wife, you
[1:36:55] let your husband, you let your children,
[1:36:59] you let the cares of the world, you let
[1:37:01] some pastor, you let somebody else get
[1:37:04] that out of you.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you know that way down in
[1:37:11] your heart you're thirsting and you're
[1:37:13] hungry and you're using those things to
[1:37:15] replace that thirst and that hunger that
[1:37:17] God's placed in you for him.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; It's God trying to reveal it to you.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; See the revelation
[1:37:25] instead of and and so that that's where
[1:37:28] the quote that's where the quote ends.
[1:37:30] And see so we let these things Amen. get
[1:37:33] the joy of the Lord out of our lives and
[1:37:37] we replace them with these other things.
[1:37:38] And they may not be bad. God's given you
[1:37:42] a family. God's given you children.
[1:37:44] God's given you a wife. And God's given
[1:37:46] you a a husband. Amen. Those things are
[1:37:49] not bad. Amen. But it's when your focus
[1:37:52] is on that to please them instead of
[1:37:54] pleasing the Lord.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, the Lord will always be there. I'll
[1:37:58] come back to him.
[1:38:00] No. Then you'll then then what will
[1:38:03] happen is that you will you will you
[1:38:05] will you will see yourself less and
[1:38:08] less. Amen. Not wanting to because I
[1:38:11] can't I've been away from him so long.
[1:38:14] How can I come back to him? And it's
[1:38:16] just a trap of the enemy
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; to keep you further and further away.
[1:38:22] See what happened to David. Amen. When
[1:38:25] he had to repent that instead of
[1:38:27] fighting and staying on the firing line,
[1:38:29] Amen. as a king, he stayed home,
[1:38:34] right?
[1:38:36] He stayed home instead of doing what he
[1:38:38] was supposed to do,
[1:38:40] right? Enjoying the pleasures of life,
[1:38:43] which of course led to sin and the loss
[1:38:45] of his joy, right? He had it all. He He
[1:38:51] could He had multiple wives. I don't
[1:38:53] know how he did it, but he had multiple
[1:38:54] wives and concubines.
[1:39:00] And so this is and so this is what
[1:39:02] happened to Satan. This is what Satan's
[1:39:04] trick is to make us look to legalism to
[1:39:07] fix the problem instead of returning
[1:39:10] back to our joy. So what happens is
[1:39:13] instead of instead of you addressing
[1:39:16] what stole your joy,
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; right? Let's just say it let's just say
[1:39:21] it's your job. Instead of you addressing
[1:39:23] that,
[1:39:26] what you do is say 2026 is coming
[1:39:30] and we're going to I'm going to make
[1:39:33] sure I start doing devotionals more well
[1:39:36] with my family and I'm going to make
[1:39:38] sure that I start praying more and I'm I
[1:39:40] just start doing and I'm reading my
[1:39:42] Bible more. Instead of reading one one
[1:39:44] verse, I'm going to read three verses
[1:39:47] every day. And I'm going to make sure
[1:39:49] that I that that I keep up with this.
[1:39:52] And you and and what you try to do is
[1:39:54] you try to make your family as well try
[1:39:57] to obey that. Try to follow that as
[1:39:59] well. And when they don't want to do it,
[1:40:01] Amen. You you start getting upset and
[1:40:04] you start getting frustrated because
[1:40:06] don't you understand? I'm trying to get
[1:40:07] back. Why aren't you all in in line? The
[1:40:11] problem is is that they didn't lose
[1:40:12] their joy. You did.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; And so you want to mold them to what you
[1:40:17] want. And you get frustrated and then
[1:40:19] again and then you start reading the
[1:40:21] word and you start reading the message
[1:40:23] and you start seeing there how brother
[1:40:25] Brandham starts condemning your life
[1:40:28] and then he's like this is worse than
[1:40:30] than than I should have just not even
[1:40:33] started
[1:40:35] and now back and then you go back to
[1:40:39] what was bringing you the joy
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; back to your job again working 80 hours
[1:40:45] instead of 40 missing in church, missing
[1:40:48] time with your family, doing what you're
[1:40:50] supposed
[1:40:57] and we're always in this cycle and you
[1:41:00] because you tried to fix it through
[1:41:01] legalism
[1:41:03] and legalism never works.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Your legalism will never will will never
[1:41:09] appease God. Amen. So David, that's what
[1:41:12] he thought when he when uh that he could
[1:41:15] return back to his joy through legalism.
[1:41:18] Because when Nathan came to him, the
[1:41:20] prophet, and told him about the about
[1:41:22] the uh uh uh the the the the uh the
[1:41:26] story of the man who had many sheep and
[1:41:29] many things and and then there was only
[1:41:31] one who had one and and that man came
[1:41:34] and took that one sheep from him. And
[1:41:36] what did David do? Because this is what
[1:41:38] what this is what we do. Amen. We
[1:41:41] do something about it. Kill that man.
[1:41:43] Capture and take him.
[1:41:46] David knew what he had done wrong.
[1:41:51] And so he was trying to appease. Maybe
[1:41:53] this will appease God. Amen. Through my
[1:41:56] legalism.
[1:41:57] Amen. Do something about that man. Get
[1:42:00] in him. And Nathan the prophet had to
[1:42:02] tell him, but you're that man.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; In other words, came down to the point,
[1:42:08] you're the problem.
[1:42:10] It's not your family and it's not the
[1:42:12] pastor and it's not the church. You are
[1:42:15] the problem.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; You are the problem.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; It's not, oh, it's the president or it's
[1:42:21] it's the economy. No, you the president
[1:42:25] can't make you pray less or pray more.
[1:42:29] It's you who wants to or not.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you can't fix it with
[1:42:35] legalism,
[1:42:36] but you can by faith.
[1:42:39] faith in God's word. Amen. Stay with me.
[1:42:41] Now, we're we're we're coming down to to
[1:42:43] to the wire. Now, Brother Brandham says,
[1:42:46] "Will you lay hands upon me and free?"
[1:42:49] This is the same lady that was asking
[1:42:51] the question we just read earlier. And
[1:42:53] so, Brother Brandham gives the answer uh
[1:42:56] gives adds to that to that answer. She
[1:42:59] says, Brother Brandham's rereading the
[1:43:01] question, "Now, will you lay hands upon
[1:43:03] me? I'm free from that. Sister dear or
[1:43:06] brother dear. Sure I'd lay hands on you,
[1:43:10] but that wouldn't free you.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; It's not about you coming up here and
[1:43:15] say, "Brother Wade, I know Brother Wade
[1:43:17] or if the or Brother Daryl Ward comes or
[1:43:20] if any evangelist who who's had miracles
[1:43:23] in their life or does great things, if
[1:43:25] they could just lay their hands on my
[1:43:27] child, I know everything will be all
[1:43:28] right." Amen. No, it's your faith.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:34] And see, brother Brennham himself with
[1:43:36] the ministry that he had, he said,
[1:43:38] "Sister dear, I could lay hands on you,
[1:43:40] but that wouldn't free you."
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; See, what would free you? What would
[1:43:45] restore your joy? You you you're is to
[1:43:48] understand that you're already free.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; You're already free. Amen. You're
[1:43:56] already untied.
[1:43:58] You don't have to worry about being
[1:44:01] free. You're already free. Brother
[1:44:03] Brandham says,
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; "Amen. Jesus made you free."
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; This is still the prophet.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Be not again entangled in the yoke of
[1:44:12] bondage. You're free as you can be.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be tangled up. Laying
[1:44:18] my hands on you is just a tradition.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; We might We might do that. that that why
[1:44:26] I could do that. But that still wouldn't
[1:44:28] set you free until you accept what he
[1:44:31] done for you.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's just me saying, "Lord, I
[1:44:37] believe it and I'm getting up from this
[1:44:40] place that I'm at and moving forward."
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you said it already in
[1:44:45] your word. That's you. Amen. Believing
[1:44:47] his word and taking it. Amen. And moving
[1:44:50] forward with it.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's why brother Bram said
[1:44:55] that sin is unbelief. Unbelief in what?
[1:44:58] Unbelief in what he already said about
[1:45:01] you.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; And trying to add your own ideas to it
[1:45:05] or your own thoughts about it or your
[1:45:07] own legalism about it. Amen. God already
[1:45:09] said accept what God said. Amen.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; And let him already he's you're free. So
[1:45:16] that you might have started this year
[1:45:17] and we're 11 days in. Amen. And you
[1:45:20] still don't feel free. You're free
[1:45:21] today.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're free. you right now.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; I don't have to lay hands on you.
[1:45:26] Brother Aaron doesn't have to lay hands
[1:45:27] on you. No deacon here has to lay hands
[1:45:29] on you. Go out there and accept what God
[1:45:32] has already done for you.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Take God at his word.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. You know, I just
[1:45:45] to add to this, you know, when we go out
[1:45:47] in in in in in the mission field and and
[1:45:50] it's just it makes me so so sad
[1:45:52] sometimes to see, you know, people,
[1:45:56] young people especially, who have who
[1:46:00] want to make their life right and you've
[1:46:02] preached a sermon or I've interpreted
[1:46:04] for a brother there who's who's who has
[1:46:07] preached and and they come through and
[1:46:08] you see the same people coming through
[1:46:10] the line constantly.
[1:46:13] or coming up front and it's the same
[1:46:15] problem, the same issue, the year after
[1:46:17] year, month after month, and whenever
[1:46:19] you go, it's the same person.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; And I'm like, they just haven't gotten
[1:46:24] they they haven't gotten a revelation of
[1:46:26] what joy really is.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; You got to have a revelation. Listen, I
[1:46:32] can't I I can't I can't change your
[1:46:34] life. Brother Wade can't change your
[1:46:36] life. It's got to be you to do it. See,
[1:46:39] until until until David realized that he
[1:46:42] was the one who sinned, then he went and
[1:46:44] did something about it.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; You've got to do something about it.
[1:46:47] Your own self. Brother Wade can't fix it
[1:46:50] for you. Brother Dell certainly couldn't
[1:46:52] fix it for you.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; I'm sure he would wanted to, but he
[1:46:59] couldn't.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; You've got to do it on your own
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; because it's a walk. What is it? When we
[1:47:05] were been discussing, Amen. last year.
[1:47:07] Amen. And it's between you and God in
[1:47:09] that secret place.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; And that's what it's coming down to now.
[1:47:14] It's not a group think anymore. It's a
[1:47:16] it's a it's a it's in the inner veil is
[1:47:19] just you and God.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. On the outer court, it was it's
[1:47:23] everybody. Everybody's getting preached
[1:47:26] to. Amen. And then in the inner court,
[1:47:29] Amen. In the in the holy place, it's
[1:47:31] only a few people that will go in there.
[1:47:33] But in the Holy of Holies, it's got to
[1:47:35] be you and God only.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because only the priest would go
[1:47:40] in there.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad that Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:47:43] our high priest, went in there already
[1:47:45] once and for all. And then all he wants
[1:47:47] us to do is come to him and say, "Lord,
[1:47:50] I am the I am the problem."
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; And Lord, change me from the inside out.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; See, and brother Brandon says that why I
[1:48:01] could do that. I could lay hands on you,
[1:48:03] but that still wouldn't set you free
[1:48:05] until you accept what he done for you.
[1:48:08] Amen. That's just me saying, "Lord, I
[1:48:10] believe it." All right. So, we're
[1:48:12] talking about new beginnings. Amen. And
[1:48:14] I'm coming down to to the close now.
[1:48:17] Nature, we know it expresses new
[1:48:19] beginnings. How many like new
[1:48:20] beginnings?
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; How many like multiple chances?
[1:48:25] Amen.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; You know, I I I you know, those of us
[1:48:28] who play video games,
[1:48:32] I used to be a very big video game guy
[1:48:34] and I just I I still like them, but I
[1:48:36] don't have time to play them anymore. I
[1:48:38] like to play Mario every now and then.
[1:48:40] You know, I'm a still a kid at heart.
[1:48:43] [laughter]
[1:48:44] But when you played Mario, when you
[1:48:46] played Tetris, or you played any of
[1:48:49] those games, Amen. You liked when you
[1:48:51] had multiple lives
[1:48:53] [laughter]
[1:48:55] and you put in that code in there. Amen.
[1:48:57] To get you to have unlimited lives,
[1:49:00] [laughter] right? Some of you remember
[1:49:01] that. Amen. Back in the 80s and 90s,
[1:49:04] you'd put the code. Amen. To get
[1:49:06] unlimited lives. There's no way I can
[1:49:08] die now. I'm going to beat this game.
[1:49:11] Amen. God has already put the code in
[1:49:13] for you. Amen. On the cross of Calvary.
[1:49:16] Amen. 2,000 years ago. Amen. You have
[1:49:19] unlimited chances. Amen.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; If you've predestinated, he said, "I'll
[1:49:24] I'll I'll not lose one."
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Contrary to what any brother might say,
[1:49:28] contrary to what you might have done in
[1:49:30] the past, Amen. God has given you
[1:49:32] unlimited lives.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord if we can put it that
[1:49:38] way. Amen.
[1:49:40] So, so if if if it's like that and we
[1:49:43] like it. Amen. Nature also expresses new
[1:49:46] beginnings. Amen. Spring after winter.
[1:49:50] Amen. We see when as dur we're now in
[1:49:54] winter time. We're looking forward to
[1:49:55] the springtime. Amen. When warmer
[1:49:57] weather comes in, right? You think, "Oh,
[1:50:00] when when winter comes in, everything's
[1:50:02] dying. The leaves are dying and
[1:50:04] everything's falling and oh no, it's
[1:50:07] everything is just falling apart. It's
[1:50:08] going to stay like this." Nope. In
[1:50:11] March, amen, everything will start
[1:50:13] coming back up again. Oh, there's a new
[1:50:16] beginning. Amen. for each one of us.
[1:50:18] Amen. They may seem dark and it may seem
[1:50:21] it may seem weary. It may seem like it
[1:50:24] nothing will change in your life. Amen.
[1:50:26] But spring's just around the corner. The
[1:50:28] lamb has been slain before the
[1:50:30] foundation of the world. Just come to
[1:50:32] him. Amen. Praise God.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Sunrise after night.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; You think that it's night time. Amen.
[1:50:39] And that it's oh, it's going to be dark
[1:50:41] forever. No. The next day the sun rises
[1:50:44] again.
[1:50:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Enjoyed that Sunday school s uh
[1:50:51] message this morning from brother
[1:50:52] Emanuel and and um he said uh talked
[1:50:55] about the seeds. Amen. Seeds when seeds
[1:50:57] planted in the ground. Amen.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; In order for them to grow, they have to
[1:51:01] die.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Right. And they might you might think,
[1:51:04] "Oh my, it's dead. It's dying." But in
[1:51:07] order for it to live, it's got to die.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; So there's a renewal. Amen. There's a
[1:51:13] new beginning. Amen. It might it went in
[1:51:15] a certain way, but then it's coming out
[1:51:16] a different way.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; You're coming out stronger than what you
[1:51:20] think.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might came in, Amen. crying
[1:51:24] and booing. Amen. Or or or low in faith,
[1:51:28] but you had some faith.
[1:51:30] Amen. But you'll come out, Amen.
[1:51:32] stronger than ever.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; If you stay in his word. Praise the
[1:51:36] Lord. A metamorphosis. Amen. Which which
[1:51:39] means it's the caterpillar turn into a
[1:51:41] butterfly. Amen. Who would think that a
[1:51:44] caterpillar or a a nasty fuzzy worm,
[1:51:48] amen, would ever be something beautiful
[1:51:50] flying in the springtime,
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; in the summertime.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And those those are beautiful.
[1:51:57] Nobody would ever think that. Only God
[1:51:58] could do something like that.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; And if God can do it for the that little
[1:52:03] worm, how much more for you? Amen.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And then of course, a rain
[1:52:08] after a drought. Amen.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So nature constantly teaches us
[1:52:14] that endings are hidden beginnings.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. When something seems like it's
[1:52:21] ended, my life is ended here. I
[1:52:24] spiritual life, I can't go on with God.
[1:52:26] That's just the beginning for God.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; That's where God could use you more.
[1:52:32] That's where God could get his glory
[1:52:34] into more. Not when you're really strong
[1:52:36] and I'm going to make it. No. God can't
[1:52:39] use that. Yeah. Dormcy is not death.
[1:52:42] Renewal can be gradual or sudden. New
[1:52:45] life often follows hardships.
[1:52:49] Amen. We know that the number eight, the
[1:52:51] eighth day, it means a fresh start. It
[1:52:54] means a new beginning. Circumcision was
[1:52:57] commanded on the eighth day, right? A
[1:53:00] new beginning for that boy, for that for
[1:53:03] the for the baby. You read that in
[1:53:04] Genesis 17:12.
[1:53:06] Jesus rose on the first day of the week
[1:53:09] which is also the eighth day if you
[1:53:11] count exclusively. Amen.
[1:53:14] [clears throat] Praise God. So the
[1:53:16] number eight uh the number uh so seven
[1:53:18] we know it means completion. Eight is
[1:53:21] what comes next and eight also is
[1:53:24] renewal, resurrection, a fresh start.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; How many believe that God's given you a
[1:53:32] fresh start? Amen.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; I believe I'll raise my hands, too.
[1:53:37] Amen. God is a God of many chances.
[1:53:40] Praise God. Look what Lamentations 3:22
[1:53:43] says. It is of the Lord's mercies that
[1:53:45] we are not consumed. They are new every
[1:53:49] morning.
[1:53:51] [laughter]
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They are new. His mercies
[1:53:54] are new. It didn't say just just few
[1:53:57] mornings. No, every morning. Psalms
[1:54:00] 103:8 says, "The Lord is merciful and
[1:54:03] gracious, slow to anger compared to some
[1:54:07] of us, slow to anger and plenteous in
[1:54:10] mercy."
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in second Peter, Amen. God is
[1:54:16] not willing that any should perish, but
[1:54:20] that all should come to repentance.
[1:54:24] Right?
[1:54:25] That's his desire. And that should be
[1:54:28] our desire, too. If we have God in us,
[1:54:32] don't you know? Oh, that's got to be a
[1:54:34] serpent seed.
[1:54:36] I mean, look at all the tattoos they
[1:54:38] got.
[1:54:40] Look at the way they talk. Look at that
[1:54:42] foul mouth. That's serpent seed. You'd
[1:54:46] be surprised.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; You would be surprised. God probably has
[1:54:53] something great. I mean, look at look at
[1:54:54] my uncle.
[1:54:57] Foulmouth.
[1:54:58] I saw him when I was younger growing up,
[1:55:00] you know, drinking and I saw him drunk
[1:55:02] all the time and he had women and things
[1:55:04] and look at him now. Raises my faith
[1:55:07] now.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; You'd be surprised what God can do.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no there is no secret of
[1:55:15] what God can do. Amen. It is no secret
[1:55:18] what God can do.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; What he's done for others, he'll do for
[1:55:22] you.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brandham says here and
[1:55:26] I believe this is the last two or three
[1:55:28] slides
[1:55:30] in in the message everlasting life and
[1:55:32] how to receive it. Brother Brandham says
[1:55:34] and I believe it's appropriate. Amen.
[1:55:36] For the new year it's obedience is
[1:55:38] better than sacrifice. Do what the Holy
[1:55:40] Spirit says do. What we need tonight is
[1:55:43] to let loose of all of our little old
[1:55:45] squeezy ideas. He says I don't know why
[1:55:48] he meant about squeezy but but our own
[1:55:51] little ideas. Let let loose of them.
[1:55:54] Right? Let go what you thought was was
[1:55:57] the way you were supposed to worship God
[1:55:59] back in the denomination or let go of
[1:56:01] that. The problem is sometimes we bring
[1:56:04] from our denominations, we bring it into
[1:56:05] the message and try to put it on other
[1:56:08] people
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; and that means you haven't been restored
[1:56:10] to the full word. You still bringing
[1:56:12] nominal things into the into into the
[1:56:14] message. Amen. And let the Holy Spirit,
[1:56:18] you are taught here, you know what's
[1:56:21] right and wrong. Brother Brown says,
[1:56:23] "You know what's right and wrong, but
[1:56:24] what you need tonight is a great big
[1:56:27] bundle full of the love of God poured
[1:56:30] out in your heart. All differences
[1:56:33] washed away."
[1:56:35] Amen. Differences with yourself, with
[1:56:37] your wife, with your pastor, with with
[1:56:38] with everybody in the church, all washed
[1:56:41] away. Amen. Bury it with the old year.
[1:56:45] Brother Brandon says, "Bury it with the
[1:56:48] old year as it passes out. Let it go. He
[1:56:52] says,
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, let it go.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's start a new life, a new
[1:56:59] beginning.
[1:57:01] Right?
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; You can't, if you're already born in the
[1:57:04] kingdom of God, you've already got the
[1:57:06] Holy Spirit in you. The only thing you
[1:57:09] have to do is cut loose from these
[1:57:11] things of the world that's holding you
[1:57:13] down, that's that's tying you down,
[1:57:16] that's making you lose your joy. Cut
[1:57:18] loose from them. said, "Let us lay aside
[1:57:21] every weight and the sin does so easily
[1:57:24] beset us that we might run with patience
[1:57:27] the life, the race that's set before
[1:57:30] us." In Hebrews, Hebrews the 12th
[1:57:32] chapter, lay aside the weights, Brother
[1:57:33] Brandham says. Praise God. And that's
[1:57:37] the way, Amen, to get back your joy.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I believe we serve the God of
[1:57:43] new beginnings. Let this year be the
[1:57:46] best year that you've ever had, saints.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let this be the year where you're
[1:57:51] more into the word. Or or you might say,
[1:57:53] "Oh, I I I have to feel something. I I
[1:57:55] got to if I don't feel something." Amen.
[1:57:58] God is not asking you to feel anything.
[1:58:00] God is asking you to believe his word.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm going to take you to for your
[1:58:04] word. It's in simplicity.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to run up and down
[1:58:09] the aisles. You don't have to speak in
[1:58:11] tongues. You don't have to do anything.
[1:58:13] And although it's good and it's
[1:58:14] encouraged and we need it.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:19] But but but but that's not Amen. that's
[1:58:22] not going to restore your joy back.
[1:58:24] Amen. To restore your joy back is to
[1:58:26] believe his word.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Brother I love that quote brother
[1:58:30] Brandham says. He said brother Jesus
[1:58:32] never said asked the people did you feel
[1:58:34] it?
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; He said did you believe it?
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe his word this
[1:58:39] morning?
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; How many believe that God can completely
[1:58:42] Amen. How many are ready to let go of
[1:58:44] the old? Amen. and and and and receive
[1:58:48] the new. Amen.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, but we're already 11 days in,
[1:58:51] brother Luis. It's too late. It's not
[1:58:53] too late for God because God don't live
[1:58:55] in time.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; God lives in eternity. Amen. And what
[1:58:59] he's done in you, Amen. It's an eternal
[1:59:01] work. Praise the Lord. And so, if he's
[1:59:03] already started the work in you, he will
[1:59:05] finish it until the day of our Lord
[1:59:07] Jesus Christ. God bless you. Amen. Let's
[1:59:09] stand to our feet.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's have the musicians come. I'm
[1:59:15] sorry I kept you all. I apologize. But
[1:59:18] hey, I don't get to preach often on
[1:59:20] Sunday mornings, so I took advantage.
[1:59:24] [laughter]
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Let's just bow our heads,
[1:59:32] Lord Jesus.
[1:59:35] And and before we bow our heads, how how
[1:59:37] many just have a need on their heart
[1:59:39] that they just want to make known to
[1:59:41] God? Lifted lifted up your hands. I I
[1:59:43] have my eyes closed. Everybody with
[1:59:45] their eyes closed. I I don't know what
[1:59:46] your need is, but God certainly does.
[1:59:50] Amen. And you just want to go ahead and
[1:59:52] just put that burden upon the Lord.
[1:59:56] Place that need before him and confide
[1:59:59] and leave it there. And you just watch
[2:00:02] and see what God is going to do about
[2:00:04] that this year. You watch and see that
[2:00:07] God is going to restore it back just as
[2:00:09] he he restores. Amen. the day from the
[2:00:13] night and he restores back the the
[2:00:16] springtime from a winter time and he
[2:00:19] makes everything new and he makes the
[2:00:20] flowers grow and he makes something come
[2:00:24] out of something that of nothing. Amen.
[2:00:28] You watch and see if God doesn't do it.
[2:00:30] But what you have to do is put your
[2:00:32] focus, your joy back in what matters. He
[2:00:36] said, "Seek ye first first the kingdom
[2:00:39] of God and his righteousness and all
[2:00:43] these other things, even the need that
[2:00:45] your hand is being represented by, all
[2:00:48] those other things will be added unto
[2:00:51] you." Amen. Let's just bow our heads.
[2:00:53] Lord Jesus, we thank you, heavenly
[2:00:56] father, for your word, Lord. And we
[2:00:58] appreciate, Lord Jesus, what you have
[2:01:00] done, Father God, for us, Lord God.
[2:01:04] Lord, we're the ones who make our life
[2:01:06] difficult and you've come to simplify it
[2:01:09] for us. And we thank you, Father God,
[2:01:11] that you said, Father God, my burden is
[2:01:14] easy and my my yoke is light, Lord
[2:01:16] Jesus. And oh Lord, if we could just let
[2:01:18] you give these things over to you,
[2:01:20] Father God, you would do more
[2:01:23] abundantly, exceedingly of what we could
[2:01:25] ask, God. Lord. Oh Lord God Almighty
[2:01:29] bless my brothers and my sisters as
[2:01:31] they're facing Father another year with
[2:01:34] with uncertainty things uncertainties
[2:01:37] Father and and things Lord may they may
[2:01:40] not know the answers to everything but
[2:01:42] oh Lord you we serve a God who has all
[2:01:45] the answers of life and I pray Lord that
[2:01:48] you would help us to confide in you
[2:01:50] Lord. Bless your people Lord. Bless them
[2:01:52] Father God. Let them have strength,
[2:01:54] Father God, to raise up and believe your
[2:01:57] word, Lord, and to not disbelieve it
[2:01:59] anymore, and to not try to make it on
[2:02:02] their own, Father, but to abide and
[2:02:06] confide in what you've already done for
[2:02:08] them. Grant, Lord Jesus, I include
[2:02:10] myself in that, Lord. I find myself in a
[2:02:13] trap sometimes where I think, if I could
[2:02:15] just do more of this or if I could just
[2:02:18] listen to more of this or read more of
[2:02:20] this.
[2:02:21] But Lord God, if when I just rest in
[2:02:24] you, Father God, then then all things
[2:02:27] are well. I I can I can start [music]
[2:02:29] thinking clearly then. And Lord, that's
[2:02:32] what we want to do in this hour.
[2:02:34] Granted, Lord Jesus, bless your people
[2:02:36] now. Meet every need amongst us, Father.
[2:02:39] And we commit the rest of the service
[2:02:40] into your hands in the mighty name of
[2:02:43] the Lord Jesus Christ. As we sing
[2:02:45] something softly, saints, worship God.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; our healer.
[2:03:05] The Lord.
[2:03:08] Amen. He's our healer.
[2:03:14] He's the one
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; your disease
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; who can meet that need. Amen. I am the
[2:03:19] Lord.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Just give it over to him this morning.

[2:03:29] that heal me. [music]

[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; This is God talking to you.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; God singing to you
[2:04:09] and I said my [music and singing] word
[2:04:12] and I healed your disease.

[2:04:28] that [singing] heal me.
[2:04:32] You are the Lord,
[2:04:34] my [singing and music] healer.
[2:04:39] Using your word,
[2:04:42] and heal my disease. [music]
[2:04:45] Anybody have a need of prayer? We'll be
[2:04:47] more than glad to pray for you. Amen. As
[2:04:49] we sing it one more time,
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; I [singing] am the God
[2:04:57] that [music]
[2:04:58] he

[2:05:42] and heal my disease.
[2:05:46] You are the [singing] Lord,
[2:05:49] my healer
[2:05:53] in the presence

[2:09:55] praise this morning? Oh, I lift up
[2:09:59] [singing]
[2:10:01] my hands to [music]
[2:10:03] you, Lord. [singing]
[2:10:06] I'm singing [music]
[2:10:09] now.
[2:10:11] I [singing] love
[2:10:14] you, Lord.
[2:10:17] Oh, we're singing.
[2:10:21] I
[2:10:23] love
[2:10:25] you, Lord. [singing]
[2:10:29] Sing
[2:10:34] [singing]
[2:10:37] you,
[2:10:39] Lord.
[2:10:41] Oh, I
[2:10:45] love
[2:10:47] [music]
[2:10:48] you. Hallelujah.
[2:10:51] Amen. I hope the word you receive this
[2:10:55] morning [music] helped you to fall more
[2:10:56] in love with Jesus Christ because that's
[2:10:59] the key is fall in love with him and he
[2:11:02] [music] loves you. And so we're thankful
[2:11:05] God for for the word this morning. Thank
[2:11:07] God for it.
[2:11:08] I I remember reading that question many
[2:11:10] years ago [music] that someone asked
[2:11:11] brother Bernham and it really just hope
[2:11:13] opened a whole another window of grace
[2:11:16] uh to the to the person who tries to
[2:11:19] serve [music] God but sometimes it's
[2:11:20] hard but his love has extended into
[2:11:24] eternity and well you [music] can't fail
[2:11:27] beyond the blood of Christ that's a
[2:11:29] bloodline you cannot cross cuz it
[2:11:31] crossed our path and it's not going to
[2:11:34] let you go
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; it runs deeper than any valley and
[2:11:37] [music] higher than any mountain. And so
[2:11:39] when you feel like that, remember what
[2:11:41] was preached this morning. Go back to it
[2:11:44] because it's strength to the believer.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; It's faith to the heart. [music]
[2:11:48] And he's not an Indian giver. Once he
[2:11:51] claimed you, sealed you, it's the
[2:11:53] finished [music] work. And that's where
[2:11:54] we lay our faith in. Amen. We're going
[2:11:56] to ask brother Aaron if he would come
[2:11:58] this [music] morning, just dismiss us in
[2:11:59] a word of prayer and any words he'd like
[2:12:01] to say before we dismiss.
[2:12:07] Amen. God bless you. It's always good to
