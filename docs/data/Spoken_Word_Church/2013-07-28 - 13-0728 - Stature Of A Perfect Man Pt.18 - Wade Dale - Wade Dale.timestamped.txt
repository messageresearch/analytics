[0:00] about it later
[0:01] okay that's fine you can hear my voice
[0:04] over just about anything or
[0:10] no comment from anybody else
[0:15] Hebrews 11.
[0:18] now we talked we've been speaking on the
[0:21] Statue of a perfect man and we know that
[0:23] the foundation is fake it's real wide at
[0:26] the bottom
[0:27] so we must get this right before we keep
[0:30] going on that's why it's been 17.
[0:32] little mini sermons on the Statue of a
[0:35] perfect man just to get us to Faith and
[0:37] now we go to the great faith chapter of
[0:39] Hebrews 11 because you've got to have
[0:41] faith we were talking about last week
[0:44] faith is the substance of things hoped
[0:47] for the evidence of things you can't
[0:48] even see how many of us saw Jesus died
[0:52] how many of us saw the prophet in person
[0:58] only two there's two people in this
[1:01] whole room that actually solve the
[1:02] prophet alive the rest of us did
[1:05] so to us it's hearsay
[1:08] Kalan is here safe
[1:11] because did you see it no he didn't see
[1:14] it but by the eye of faith I believe
[1:16] that Jesus was walking on the earth I
[1:18] believe he died in Calvary I believe he
[1:20] rose I believe there's an empty tomb and
[1:22] I believe he came back on that Pentecost
[1:24] none of that we can prove
[1:26] by scientific fact or by video
[1:30] can't prove that right so you must have
[1:33] faith and that's the foundation we got
[1:35] to have faith the evidence of Things Not
[1:38] Seen remember God does it
[1:40] then he reveals it
[1:42] then you see it right God does it
[1:46] reveals it to you that it's done and
[1:49] then he makes it manifest through you
[1:51] are through an Evidence
[1:54] of praying for your children or praying
[1:56] for your spouse or praying for your
[1:58] family and then God gives you a
[2:01] revelation like he did Dad he was you
[2:03] know many years ago that I was going to
[2:04] come back to the lord well there was no
[2:06] physical evidence that that was ever
[2:09] going to take place
[2:12] I was out in the world I was doing the
[2:14] things of the world I wasn't coming to
[2:16] church I wasn't claiming nothing
[2:18] right but God showed a man
[2:22] gave him a revelation
[2:26] and then it became manifest well knee
[2:28] see now he can say that his faith has
[2:30] been manifested in what he sees
[2:34] same way with all of us and you can take
[2:36] that not just for your family or not but
[2:38] for any situation anything we must be
[2:41] the greatest Faith Believers in the
[2:43] world
[2:45] even when we can't see it because
[2:47] remember the Bible says and will not get
[2:49] into it today the Bible says that
[2:53] if hope is already seen in other words
[2:55] it's not hope anymore
[2:59] daddy hopes
[3:01] that I was coming back to now he can't
[3:03] stand up and said well I hope he's
[3:05] coming back
[3:07] the evidence is right here
[3:10] the evidence will be seen it says the
[3:13] evidence of Things Not Seen that's
[3:16] beginning of your faith you must believe
[3:18] it before you see it
[3:22] if you see it
[3:24] why do you need faith
[3:27] we have faith for a body change it's
[3:30] laying in the word it's laying in the
[3:32] books and tanks right but do we see it
[3:35] no we're getting older gray-headed which
[3:40] used to be a real black okay now Gray
[3:44] I don't like him though he's thinner
[3:46] than the last time I saw him
[3:49] just a rifle must be not feeding me very
[3:51] well
[3:54] it's just wonderful to see you man it
[3:56] went and got up this morning if I'd have
[3:57] had 10 people to figure out a saying you
[3:59] were one of the fans so yeah but good to
[4:02] see him we had some good times together
[4:03] so
[4:04] but see faith is the substance of things
[4:07] hoped for
[4:08] there's your substance faith brother
[4:10] Ryan said you got to have faith and we
[4:13] got to have faith in this statue of a
[4:14] perfect man that Peter tells us he says
[4:17] add to your faith not God's faith
[4:22] God's got things
[4:24] God is Faith he just believes when he
[4:27] speaks it'll happen and you know what he
[4:28] does right amen you know what brother
[4:30] Brown said about the the evidence of
[4:32] things by saying for the elders obtained
[4:34] a good report
[4:35] now watch
[4:41] what it says it says
[4:45] through the faith we understand that the
[4:47] worlds were framed by just somebody
[4:49] speaking the word
[4:54] because
[4:55] sometimes we have to have a little
[4:57] substance it says the substance of
[4:58] things not seen God didn't have one
[5:01] piece of substance except what he was
[5:06] nobody understand that all we had was
[5:08] him
[5:10] he didn't have a world to take a piece
[5:12] off of and make a
[5:14] on Earth
[5:17] when he said it it appeared
[5:19] all right so you and I are gonna that's
[5:22] the same Faith you and I are going to
[5:23] have to have because Abraham was the
[5:26] father of our faith but my heavens look
[5:28] how many times he stumbled
[5:31] but when Paul writes a commentary of
[5:34] Abraham's life
[5:35] he never mentions that he give his life
[5:37] away twice
[5:38] twice
[5:40] once after the body came
[5:48] so he was still in the flesh
[5:51] but
[5:52] it happened when you get Paul's
[5:55] commentary of what Abraham says Abraham
[5:57] and he says Abraham was strong in faith
[5:59] believing the promise what was Paul
[6:02] doing Paul was looking back through the
[6:03] blood of Jesus Christ and all those were
[6:05] clean
[6:07] amen because man they're they were
[6:08] pretty bad these people were going to
[6:09] read about if you were to read into
[6:11] their commentary of their life
[6:13] pretty rotten people David had his best
[6:16] friend killed committed adultery Abraham
[6:20] went with Hagar Abraham laughed at God
[6:22] he didn't just laugh in his heart the
[6:24] Bible said he got down on his face and
[6:26] laughed at God
[6:28] but you know what though Abraham made it
[6:31] to the end he just believed there was
[6:34] something in Abraham that said okay I
[6:36] don't have the substance with me
[6:39] and as he got older he definitely knew
[6:41] he couldn't perform physically so he
[6:44] knew I believe he got stronger in faith
[6:46] as he went along in his own self whether
[6:49] the worldly things happened to him or
[6:50] not he believed that he was going to
[6:52] have that child
[6:53] and then at the end he said okay God if
[6:56] I'm gonna have it you're gonna have to
[6:57] do it well if he would have said that at
[6:59] first
[7:00] see if we would have said that at first
[7:03] we would add virtue acknowledge tempers
[7:05] because the Bible says add to your face
[7:07] so it's going to be your faith right
[7:09] brother Brown said this is my eye God
[7:11] gave it to me he didn't just say that
[7:12] stuff to Philip tape
[7:14] he said this is my eye God gave it to me
[7:17] now it's mine this is my Holy Ghost it
[7:20] come from God it was God it is God but
[7:23] once he give it to me it's mine right
[7:25] and he expects you
[7:28] expects you to do what that Holy Ghost
[7:31] says because remember you can't grieve
[7:33] it
[7:35] the Bible says you can grieve it brother
[7:37] Graham said he'd go out on a limb yeah
[7:38] it doesn't mean he comes out of you
[7:40] and go some point no once you have the
[7:42] Holy Ghost you got it for life
[7:44] that's your Eternal destination you God
[7:47] can't take it away from you but
[7:49] brother Brown said the Holy Ghost is a
[7:51] gentleman he's very timid so what will
[7:54] he do he will withdraw himself from you
[7:58] in an example listen just this is an
[8:00] example because Saul did not have the
[8:02] Holy Ghost remember nobody in this Old
[8:03] Testament had the Holy Ghost in their
[8:05] soul right because Jesus hadn't died to
[8:08] release the light okay it'll tell you in
[8:10] a minute if we get down to it it says
[8:13] they all having a good report did not
[8:15] receive the promise well what was the
[8:16] promise the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[8:18] that's the promise to the believer
[8:21] okay so they didn't have the new birth
[8:23] they had an anointing just like the
[8:25] anointed ones at the end times same
[8:27] example they don't know anyone come down
[8:28] on David
[8:29] David could speak in the first person
[8:30] they pierced my hands and my feet
[8:32] knowing him would leave him he'd go get
[8:34] into bed with a girl and commit adultery
[8:36] that does not happen to a born-again
[8:37] Believer right right so there's your
[8:40] difference okay but it will to an
[8:41] anointed one all right so you take that
[8:44] and you see Abraham and you see the ones
[8:46] that that had an anointing on them now
[8:49] we know that like I said when Paul looks
[8:51] back through the blood of Jesus it
[8:52] cleansed every one of them but he did
[8:54] not give him the Holy Ghost as a
[8:56] possession right
[8:59] the Bible says in John 5. they haven't
[9:02] received the Holy Ghost because the Holy
[9:03] Ghost wasn't given yet because Jesus
[9:05] hadn't known the word been glorified or
[9:06] died to release that life
[9:09] but they had a promise
[9:11] that they were heading toward but you
[9:14] look at Saul
[9:16] now listen Saul will be there right
[9:19] everybody understand that the Bible said
[9:22] if Samuel made it Saul made it that's
[9:25] right and and if Saul was listed with
[9:27] the prophets but remember what Saul said
[9:29] he said this who wasn't Samuel said the
[9:32] spirit of God has left you or he I think
[9:34] Saul even said himself the spirit of God
[9:35] has left me right right well now it
[9:38] didn't leave him and leave him alone he
[9:42] just couldn't feel that anointing he had
[9:43] grieved that anointing away from him
[9:47] but he was counted with the prophets and
[9:49] when he died he stood there with Samuel
[9:51] Uncle Samuel said tomorrow you'll be
[9:52] with me so wherever Samuel was that's
[9:54] where Saul went right so you see all
[9:56] these things that Saul did and you same
[9:57] thing with you and I we can get the Holy
[10:00] Ghost the baptism of the new birth
[10:02] because the new birth and the Holy Ghost
[10:04] you have to be careful because you can
[10:06] have the Holy Ghost brother bear said
[10:07] right on your spirit Spirit man get in
[10:10] anointing every day of your life just
[10:12] like he did with these in the Old
[10:13] Testament and die and go to hell why
[10:16] because it's not a new birth that's
[10:18] right a new birth is a dying
[10:20] and a new life amen okay see Abraham
[10:23] didn't have a dying and a new life
[10:25] Abraham was Abraham he just had Faith to
[10:28] believe what somebody said that's right
[10:30] it's like a and I'm like that I believe
[10:32] God God couldn't have just picked
[10:34] Abraham and said I'm gonna Abraham's
[10:36] gonna be my man and he's the one that's
[10:38] going to do it that's a respecter person
[10:40] true there's no telling how many people
[10:42] God spoke to and said get up and get out
[10:45] of this country
[10:46] Abraham was the only one they said okay
[10:50] I'll do it I'll get up and leave okay if
[10:53] not then God's will respect your persons
[10:56] but let's read this and and read through
[10:58] this chapter and kind of comment on the
[11:01] people
[11:02] because you're going to have to realize
[11:04] whether you just have a holy ghost
[11:05] anointing or the New Birth because you
[11:06] know what anointing ones at the end time
[11:08] is here right it's in full manifestation
[11:12] we see it now all these people that you
[11:14] know preached 10 or 12 years and then
[11:16] all of a sudden turn the message out
[11:19] say it's wrong say it's false
[11:23] the dude didn't have a new birth
[11:27] I'm sorry
[11:28] it's Rod Bergen and Jeremy Bergen and
[11:30] I'll name them because I don't care
[11:32] they're just filth to me they're just
[11:33] built they're causing people to turn
[11:35] away from this message the greatest
[11:36] thing and they walk in the shadow of it
[11:39] I actually had to walk in the shadow
[11:40] they walked in the light of it
[11:43] but they walked
[11:44] with an anointing right that's right not
[11:48] with that Faith like at the bottom of
[11:50] that pyramid so there's no way they can
[11:52] grow in the stature of God because
[11:54] somewhere along the line and it's
[11:56] happening now somewhere along the line
[11:58] you'll see him manifest who they really
[12:00] are right so we see people like that and
[12:04] and some of these people getting on the
[12:05] Internet you know but
[12:07] they just don't have faith they don't
[12:09] have the new birth that's right because
[12:10] the new birth will attack brother Brown
[12:12] said and we read the quote a couple
[12:14] weeks ago brother Brown said without the
[12:16] new birth you'll fight that's right
[12:18] you'll fight the word
[12:21] and fight the word and fight the word
[12:22] and fight the word see if you're a word
[12:24] finder that means you're a word rejecter
[12:26] right and word projectors go to hell
[12:28] that's what the prophet said in pretty
[12:30] plain and simple amen is that why the
[12:32] scripture says they'll come up falling
[12:34] away first that's correct we shouldn't
[12:37] be so surprised too you shouldn't be so
[12:40] surprised when we see no we should not
[12:42] be surprised but I'm surprised who it
[12:45] come from
[12:46] that's what I'm surprised is who it's
[12:48] come from right I thought maybe it would
[12:51] be those mate Believers which they were
[12:52] made Believers but the ones may be in
[12:54] the congregation but then you got to go
[12:55] back and say
[12:57] the scripture where they come up to
[12:59] Jesus and you know in the in the end and
[13:01] the judgment and they say have I not
[13:04] done Mighty Works cast out Devils that's
[13:08] preachers
[13:09] so you got to get into the preacher
[13:11] range because if the devil can get the
[13:13] preacher he's got you if the devil can
[13:15] get bad he's got every one of us because
[13:17] we can't go no higher than the pastor
[13:18] right so he's he's a Target I'm a Target
[13:22] all ministers are targets
[13:24] because if he can get them
[13:26] see if Rod Bergen was just a lay member
[13:29] in brother biscal's church if he was
[13:31] just somebody came to church and worked
[13:32] and didn't say much and was kind of
[13:34] unassuming
[13:36] he wouldn't have the power he has to get
[13:39] on the internet and say what he does why
[13:41] because he walks so close
[13:44] Judas walked so close
[13:46] until even the other 11 when he did what
[13:49] he did the other 11 had no clue what he
[13:51] was doing right that's right
[13:55] someone I questioned this but that
[13:58] someone said blessed is the man that
[14:01] walketh not in the counselors beyond God
[14:04] now they're Hypocrites a few weeks ago
[14:08] we were standing in the way of Sinners
[14:10] that's obvious you're a citizen in the
[14:13] sea of the scornful now who would that
[14:16] be today
[14:19] is that what you're talking about
[14:23] well that's what they're doing are they
[14:24] they're they're they're they're they're
[14:26] saying the message is not right they're
[14:28] saying brother Branham this and that and
[14:30] the other
[14:31] listen
[14:32] there's one thing for sure the Holy
[14:34] Ghost will not do that
[14:37] the Holy Ghost will not turn down the
[14:38] word now to hold it now you listen this
[14:41] is where we're gonna still stay on faith
[14:42] but we're still going to be on the new
[14:44] birth because faith is the new birth all
[14:46] right
[14:47] there's times when you cannot understand
[14:49] that's why you need virtue and all this
[14:52] tempers patient you get all that but
[14:54] like I said last week and I I hope you
[14:57] got the analogy
[14:59] the Holy Ghost is like a is like a uh
[15:02] capsule
[15:04] that you take for a pill
[15:07] right right what's inside that capsule
[15:11] will do you good but it won't do you any
[15:14] good if it doesn't get outside that
[15:15] capsules right and that's the same way
[15:17] this is the capsule everybody understand
[15:19] what I'm saying there's powder inside
[15:21] that pill you can take it apart and look
[15:23] in it you know it's got the good stuff
[15:25] but it's encapsulated
[15:27] are enclosed
[15:29] by glycerin
[15:32] right and then when that gets in your
[15:33] stomach and warms up it dissolves and it
[15:36] lets the good stuff out
[15:38] same way with God when you get the
[15:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost or the New
[15:42] Birth
[15:43] you get all the goods
[15:44] right
[15:45] right you get all the goods you need
[15:47] brother I'm saying you need to get
[15:48] everything you need for the journey but
[15:50] remember let's go back to where brother
[15:51] man preach doors and doors he said even
[15:53] when you let God in your house right
[15:57] he said there's a door here of Pride
[15:59] there's a door here Prejudice there's a
[16:00] door here he named a lot of doors well
[16:02] you know what
[16:04] God's Not Gonna remember he's a
[16:06] gentleman he's timid if you say God
[16:08] don't go in that door he'll fail that's
[16:10] right he said but you will not get the
[16:12] blessings
[16:13] of me cleaning that door of me cleaning
[16:16] that room out you're not gonna get the
[16:17] blessings of that that's going to be
[16:18] your dirty laundry for the rest of the
[16:19] time if you're going to keep that right
[16:22] right that's why the baptism of the Holy
[16:25] Ghost is so ill-taught and Ill
[16:27] understood
[16:29] you've got to you can have problems in
[16:32] your life
[16:35] come on baby we can have we have and
[16:38] then we look you know girls say well
[16:39] that that brother and sister they're
[16:41] they're having trouble they must not be
[16:43] born again no they're just human
[16:45] right they're humans that's the capsule
[16:47] you're looking at that's right but see
[16:49] it then you see the manifestation is if
[16:52] they quit coming to church if they get
[16:54] it you know separate get a divorce and
[16:55] if they keep doing those things that are
[16:58] not right you can say hey they never got
[17:00] a birth
[17:02] but not at first that's why you got to
[17:05] have patience that's why all this
[17:08] patience is there
[17:10] you just gotta let it out
[17:13] patience is the Holy Ghost is patience
[17:16] but see remember what I said about this
[17:19] is the way I say it not changing the
[17:21] word of God but I believe reading
[17:22] between the lines
[17:24] the Bible says add to your faith
[17:28] all right let's change that add to what
[17:30] you believe right
[17:32] because it's just what you believe based
[17:34] on an individual affair with God it's
[17:36] what you believe add to what you believe
[17:39] virtue
[17:40] add to what you believe knowledge
[17:42] because you'll only have as much
[17:44] knowledge as you believe
[17:50] the people in the Dark Ages all they had
[17:52] was just enough to get enough light to
[17:55] know that Jesus died for their sins and
[17:57] to know that there was a message brought
[17:59] by colomba probably didn't hear him in
[18:01] person because remember the messenger
[18:03] always comes at the end of the age and
[18:04] then brings it and there's a 1500 year
[18:06] age there in Columbus time so you know
[18:08] they didn't hear him physically speaking
[18:11] but they believe what he said they died
[18:14] they're waiting on us but they have the
[18:17] new birth just like you do right there's
[18:20] not different levels of the new birth
[18:21] now there's different levels of this
[18:24] stature of a perfect man
[18:26] that we here on the Earth
[18:29] it's not just that you get the baptism
[18:31] on the Holy Ghost and then you go on
[18:32] vacation
[18:34] you know you get the baptism on the Holy
[18:35] Ghost and you start your job and you
[18:37] don't get a vacation because Satan don't
[18:40] believe in vacation
[18:42] he's there at church when you're not all
[18:45] right so we're not going to get through
[18:47] this Hebrews 11 3. through the faith we
[18:50] understand that the worlds were framed
[18:52] by the word of God so that things which
[18:54] are seen
[18:56] were not made of things which do appear
[18:59] in other words
[19:01] derp pottery
[19:04] are aluminum metal rubber car
[19:09] see that's what we do we take things
[19:10] that's already done well see that's easy
[19:12] that's not faith
[19:13] right that's just human knowledge to put
[19:16] things together
[19:17] you and I today have to have faith in
[19:19] something that we absolutely can't hold
[19:21] in our hand
[19:23] s sure we can hold it in our hand
[19:26] but do we believe what's in it right do
[19:30] we believe what's in it is for you
[19:33] not for somebody else for you okay so I
[19:36] say many times all those people in the
[19:38] Old Testament the Bible says we're
[19:40] giving for example so take their name
[19:41] out and put your name in
[19:45] in the journeys of Life take your name
[19:47] out take David's name out and stick your
[19:49] name in take Solomon's name out and
[19:51] stick your name in those things that
[19:52] we're talking about in The Book of
[19:53] Proverbs because he's talking about my
[19:55] son he's talking about his walk in life
[19:57] he talks about his daddy David we'll put
[20:00] that in there for yourself because this
[20:02] the Bible's talking to you
[20:04] if not it's a history book
[20:06] just a good old history book that we
[20:08] read about George Washington and Abraham
[20:10] Lincoln
[20:10] but this is somebody that George
[20:13] Washington Abraham Lincoln can't come
[20:15] back inside of you and make you act like
[20:17] George Washington Abraham Lincoln right
[20:19] but the man that wrote this can actually
[20:22] come back into you
[20:24] and make you
[20:25] this amen only that's the only man that
[20:29] can ever do that that's Jesus Christ or
[20:31] the Christ
[20:32] right which do appear for by faith
[20:40] comes that stinking security thing again
[20:43] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[20:46] excellent sacrifice than Cain in other
[20:48] words he lived a greater sacrificial
[20:51] life than Cain
[20:53] right coach Kane brother around you
[20:56] um you go back and you listen to what
[20:58] brother said about Cain
[21:00] Kane was not a bad person
[21:02] Kane was very religious
[21:04] Cain was not one that didn't go to
[21:06] church he probably went to church more
[21:07] than able to
[21:09] church as far as they had Church which
[21:12] was alter worship right so Cain and Abel
[21:16] were equal when it come to that but he
[21:18] offered a more excellent sacrifice than
[21:20] came by which he obtained witness that
[21:23] he was righteous God testifying of his
[21:26] gifts
[21:27] rough day
[21:29] there's the gifts that God gave us right
[21:30] there add to your faith virtue and your
[21:32] virtue knowledge and all these tempers
[21:33] those are gifts and by it he ain't being
[21:36] dead yet speaketh remember said the
[21:38] blood speaks out of the Earth by faith
[21:41] Enoch
[21:43] was translated that he should not see
[21:46] death
[21:47] and was not found because God had
[21:49] translated him for before his
[21:50] translation not after
[21:53] before his translation we're not going
[21:56] to live for God afterwards
[21:59] we'll be gone afterwards
[22:03] we got to be like God before amen and
[22:06] there's the good report
[22:09] but before his translation he had this
[22:11] testimony that he pleased God
[22:15] but without faith it is impossible to
[22:17] please him for he that cometh to God
[22:20] must believe that he is what God
[22:23] must believe that he's God
[22:26] that's why that the
[22:28] one God Doctrine had to be brought back
[22:31] into the church because which one are
[22:32] you going to believe the Father the Son
[22:33] of the Holy Ghost which one are you
[22:35] going to believe in because that's what
[22:36] they're doing
[22:37] a denominational world you know all they
[22:39] believe on Jesus who speaks to God for
[22:41] us and you know they're just as Catholic
[22:42] as Catholic is
[22:44] you know they believe in three persons
[22:46] of the godhead and all this stuff that's
[22:47] why brother Branham had to come back
[22:49] that's why a prophetic Prophet had to
[22:51] come break the word back down for us put
[22:54] it back to where it was supposed to be
[22:55] what it's irukable
[22:58] built the foundation right
[23:01] brother Brown had to come and put that
[23:03] Foundation back together sweep it off
[23:05] get it ready because there's no way
[23:07] brother Isaac there's no way that that
[23:10] you could have attained what Peter said
[23:13] in the first age
[23:15] because it had been eaten and corroded
[23:17] so much so God was still working
[23:20] God was still working in the people but
[23:23] there was no way to put that stature of
[23:25] a person I mean who in the world would
[23:26] even even Peter I was telling him the
[23:29] other day uh Elijah that Peter didn't do
[23:32] that Peter didn't make a chart and show
[23:34] what we needed Peter just said
[23:37] once you get this you need to add this
[23:39] once you get this you need to add this
[23:41] once you get this you need to add this
[23:43] but then we had a profit come in right
[23:45] put it in the word
[23:47] that it was a mountain a pyramid
[23:49] Mountain
[23:51] and showed
[23:52] where the Capstone was because remember
[23:56] the Cornerstone had been rejected which
[23:58] was The Headstone really which is Christ
[24:00] it had been took off
[24:03] and what down Through the Ages there's
[24:05] no way man could get to that that's
[24:07] right why because the denominational
[24:09] weeds and Creeds had grown up through it
[24:12] still there was wheat in there
[24:14] had a lot of Tears so we had to come to
[24:16] the end time to where you took a profit
[24:18] and see I can understand this and then
[24:20] when you look at people that that Caleb
[24:23] as an example of the end time believer
[24:26] Caleb had nothing
[24:29] he had no inheritance of any part of the
[24:31] land and I believe Joshua just looked at
[24:33] him and said hey man you've been with me
[24:35] this whole time
[24:36] what do you want
[24:39] well
[24:40] first thing Caleb said was he said I've
[24:42] been eyeing that mountain right over
[24:44] there I don't like that mountain man
[24:48] yeah I like that mountain
[24:51] but you know what he done
[24:53] he didn't just walk over there and say
[24:55] I'm Caleb get off my mountain
[24:59] did he the Bible said he fought for the
[25:03] ice and high bites and Levites and not
[25:06] the Levites but the High bikes and the
[25:07] JB Sykes and and the website
[25:11] my brother Kendry Diggs said he said you
[25:13] fight all these ice he said now we're
[25:15] fighting the website so and that's a
[25:18] good that's a good analogy but that's
[25:20] what Caleb was doing he went up there
[25:22] and he fought
[25:24] think about Caleb Kayla went with Joshua
[25:27] helped them fight all that
[25:30] stuffing Kanan get them out
[25:33] and then he comes up and says I'm just
[25:36] as strong today as I was 40 years ago
[25:38] which made him 80.
[25:40] and he had that 80 years old he had to
[25:43] go over there and get that he had to go
[25:44] fight him back off of that mountain
[25:47] but you know what he did he did that's
[25:49] the that's the Journey of the believer
[25:51] he did what he said he was going to do
[25:53] his heart's desire was to have that
[25:55] mountain if your hearts desire is to
[25:56] have this mountain
[25:58] God will give you that mouth you can
[26:00] have it those removable that great
[26:02] Mountain
[26:03] all right so you look at mountains then
[26:05] the Bible and then you see a a Prophet
[26:07] come up and he said the city
[26:11] the city is a pyramid shape amen
[26:14] Mountain
[26:16] see a pyramid-shaped mountain with all
[26:19] the Believers inside that City and it'd
[26:22] be a steady incline man just explained
[26:25] it well hey you know what he had to
[26:27] bring that straight from the mind of God
[26:28] because nobody else knew that that's
[26:30] right so whether brother Brown a missed
[26:32] a date I don't believe he did I don't
[26:34] believe he was wrong if he was wrong God
[26:36] corrected him you and I are not supposed
[26:38] to all right so I don't correct the
[26:40] prophet I wasn't sitting here to correct
[26:41] him brother Brown said wrestling Faith
[26:43] lives in those books and tapes so I have
[26:46] to go in them not on them he didn't say
[26:47] Rapture and faith lies on them he said
[26:50] it lies in them so it's got to be a
[26:52] revelation own it it'll kill you
[26:55] own it it'll kill you in it you'll find
[26:59] what you need all right so by faith Noah
[27:02] no but without faith is impossible to
[27:04] please him
[27:06] you say well I don't have faith for this
[27:07] I'm faithful that
[27:09] you have faith in the word
[27:11] like I said many times for my children
[27:14] for my daughter all the ones
[27:18] the journey means nothing that's right
[27:21] God said I could have my kids
[27:23] so there's my daughter sitting right
[27:25] there next seat
[27:30] him had to believe Abraham said God you
[27:33] said I was going to have a baby no you
[27:35] take care of it because you can't save
[27:37] your children
[27:38] you can't say it there's no man ever
[27:40] saved another man except Jesus Christ
[27:42] that's right no man
[27:44] there's no man can save you except one
[27:47] that's the Lord Jesus all right so you
[27:49] got to have that kind of faith for he
[27:51] that cometh to God cometh
[27:55] ongoing no just one time coming because
[27:58] God must believe that he is what is
[28:00] he is he's a great I am he is and that
[28:04] he is a rewarder
[28:08] there's your reward right there
[28:10] of him that diligently remember we were
[28:12] talking about diligent and dilatory
[28:14] totally different
[28:15] dilatory is lazy shiftless
[28:19] doesn't do much but diligent is somebody
[28:21] that gets up and goes to work every day
[28:23] and works all the time and does what
[28:25] he's supposed to do same way with a
[28:27] Christian we must be diligent to seek
[28:29] him all right by faith Noah being warned
[28:31] of God of things not as not seen as yet
[28:36] now Noah
[28:39] what was Noah doing he's like God it
[28:42] ain't raining to drop since I've been
[28:43] alive and I'm 600 years old
[28:46] 600 years
[28:48] and you say you're going to flood this
[28:50] whole world water where's it going to
[28:52] come from I I don't believe he
[28:54] questioned that I believe he just said
[28:55] God you said it we're going to do it all
[28:58] right let's go
[28:59] we'll start at verse seven next Sunday
[29:03] Lord with us
[29:05] thank you
[29:42] thank you
[30:00] foreign
