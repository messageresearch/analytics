out your power in love [Music] shining in the light [Music] as we sing holy holy [Applause] amen good to be in the house of the lord good to be on wednesday middle of the week time to beat on the devil a little while he doesn't beat on us beat on him hey man good to be back home good to be back in the house with lord thank you all for uh um bob and louise did a wonderful job sunday so yeah yes good job good job sunday so uh we praise the lord and thank you for that but remember this sunday boy tell you how different how different a day makes we uh on thursday you know we announced we were going to brother jewels sunday to preach and he called and said he's going to have to have a procedure done on wednesday so he had the quarantine he couldn't see one person but his wife until from sunday or saturday till wednesday so he called me and canceled so we were coming to church here then saturday about two o'clock when i got off of work brother tim calhoun called he said we're having a special meeting and the preacher can't get here can you come so um a preacher in indiana was going to do the two services on saturday night and sunday it was an anniversary service for his church and someone in his uh congregation passed away suddenly so we had to turn around go back to indiana so we flew flew we we drove up there and didn't get there in time for saturday night but we got there time for sunday so we just went on over to illinois and got our work done but we're still going to brother heights this weekend because we already promised him we're coming so we're going up there and i guess brother they'll be doing both services this sunday brother aaron what you decide you you make that schedule brother aaron will be preaching wednesday though i like this new calendar he writes down what he wants and i just read it off brother aaron will be preaching wednesday hey okay well somebody we can get in touch with him and brother trevor eamons will be with us the next weekend on march the 21st also remember the time changes again like taran said spring forward saturday night and hopefully they'll get that bill passed in the georgia house legislature so we won't have to ever change our clocks again yeah you ain't kidding i don't like that changing back and forth times and all that and then some observe it and some don't indiana never changes there so when you go there you don't arizona never changes there so you don't when you go there you don't know where you're one hour two hour three hours behind so or forward so i'll be glad when time will be no longer and we won't have to watch there won't be no watches in glory thank you lord but um keep those things in your heart and your prayer remember june 17th through that weekend will be the father's day trip and also will be time for the sisters to go to pigeon forge so just keep that in your heart and your mind just remember each one of these and remember the ones that are sick like i said before we got plenty to pray for and uh and the uh the devil's on the rampage but you know what god wins every time amen god wins every time i already won i was thinking today uh i heard brother branham you know he says it two or three times he said you know if if jesus was standing here in a suit of clothes today he said he can't heal you he said all he's going to do is tell you i've already done it so why don't we take that analogy and put it to our heart and say hey it's already finished everybody's wanting a light and a cloud and a you know a feeling and an emotion i just want jesus to whisper in my ear remember what i've already said it is finished it's done it's done amen so if we'll take that that's how we're going to take a body change brother louise we're talking about uh sunday morning to take a body change it's not going to be we're not going to have to get big muscles and we're not going to have to run a marathon uh-uh it's just believing what god's already said amen and by the holy ghost that's what we're going to do amen that's what it was sent for was to give us what strength to give us the ability to get out of here if you don't have it you won't get out of here simple as that all right so let's go to hebrews 9 11 and continue on eternal redemption we spoke part of this at brother kim sunday and really had a real good time people are real precious up there really nice people and uh brother tim says tell all of you hello and god bless you so hebrews 9 11 we'll read that scripture again before we get started we'll try to get through the fourth dimension into the fifth dimension and i want you to understand something when when bob was speaking sunday afternoon we were listening to it coming down the road coming back home sunday and you know you can preach all your life and you can know the message paul says unless you have charity he said you can even know the mysteries now that's kind of mysterious that you can know the mysteries and not have the holy ghost because that's what he's talking about right exactly but if you'll get the holy ghost that means the mysteries become more plain and the mystery becomes history because the one that the mystery is talking about is you christ in you not somewhere else not in a book not on a tape in you the hope of glory amen so hebrews 9 verse 11 let's pray before we get started dear lord thank you for this evening that you've given us to come out lord we stand here lord as as one that's totally insufficient we as human beings make so many mistakes every day our thoughts and ideas get in our way lord but i pray just for a little while lord i was thinking the other day you know the as you were watching over your children of israel you told them they're in deuteronomy in different places of what to do what to put on what to wear the clothes and the blood and all the things you they had to do but when they walked in behind that holy of holies it was aaron it was the high priest and you lord but they had made you had made a way for them to get in there and if everything was right then you accepted the sacrifice well lord we know that that veil was rent at calvary we know that we're now all high priests that we can all come boldly to the throne of grace lord and give that petition as we just said that by your stripes we're already healed by your stripes lord everything that you took it all at calvary and took it to your bosom and you destroyed death but lord that's been 2 000 years ago and we just got to start believing that that's already done and not that you have to come and do it again father we pray that you would anoint the word lord anoint the hearers and especially north the speaker lord speak the words you would have to speak lord and they will become true father we know we got plenty around here that sick maybe not sick as envirosic but lord many things satan is really trying to destroy our bodies because that's really the only thing he can get to but lord you said there was a protection for that you said you've already took those stripes you've already took every disease the prophet of god tells us every disease was destroyed at calvary lord we just got to be able to realize it lord well let us realize it tonight father and let us go on today as christians better people better christians in this world that's dying and don't know what to do and lord they don't have a god they have many gods but we have one true and living god and jesus christ is your name father we know who you are we know who where you reside and we know what you've said now i pray that you would put all that together for us drive away the evil spirits and the things that are trying to hinder us from hearing from you father just bless us now and take care of us in jesus name we pray amen hebrews 9 11 but christ being coming high priests of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is the same not of this building neither by the blood of bulls and of goats of goats and calves i try to say that other scripture but by his own blood he entered in what once once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us you may be seated now that word eternal means a lot because it's eternal redemption he's always going to be walking around in eternity now we're not going to need listen when we get over there i want you to understand this this is why i want you to see what we're talking about because once we get over there it's not like we're going to need to go into the holy of holies every time and we don't have to even do that now we don't have to come boldly to the throne of grace when we get into the new city we are the grace we don't have to beg forgiveness that's going to be hard for humans to see because you and i are built on i was thinking about this the other day you and i are built on believing what somebody's done that we have not seen who he is but when we get to that future home we're going to see the man that took my sin we're going to sit and we'll be with him for how long for an eternity and every time he raises his hands and every time he shakes your hand or every time he walks up to you you're going to see the nail scars you're going to see the prince in his hand and you're going to see the prince in his feet and you know what you may not remember all the things that happened while you were here but i'll promise you you're going to remember that right and you're going to remember that that man that m-a-n came down here to take on a body to be marred and scarred so that you and i can go to glory and not have a scarred body if you have an operation today if you've had an operation today you won't have a scar over there your bone's not gonna have a crack in it your teeth are not gonna halfway be out your head right praise god but we don't father we can't fathom that though bob we just can't fathom that we're going to a place where we don't have to worry about time tomorrow don't even have to worry about tomorrow because there is no tomorrow we don't have to worry about what we've done did we sin yesterday lord did we make you unhappy that's all gone folks listen though we've got to take a piece of that and when the holy ghost came and broke through that sound barrier on the day of pentecost and went into those people in the licks of fire that's what came no more no less that's what showed up to burn your old nature out put his nature in and it's that same nature that's going to take you into the future home if not then you're going into these other dimensions that we're fixing to talk about where there's no hope listen if you know what you know now and you die and go in the fifth dimension we're in trouble because we know too much and it may be head knowledge but you know what i'd rather have a head knowledge and then get the holy ghost because the holy ghost said it leads you and guides you into all truth it just sparks what you got you gotta pack it in you gotta you can't just put the seed you can't i'm fixing to sew some listen man i'm gonna plant some taters tomorrow not potatoes we don't do that down south it's taters we're gonna plant taters later we'll plant maters but we're gonna plant taters tomorrow but you know what they're sitting on my kitchen counter right now they won't make one tater even though it's a tater even though it's got a little bud sticking up about this far getting ready to come up it will what it will die unless it's put into good ground it will die and wither and blow away just the parable tells us and that's the same thing i was thinking about when luis and bob were were speaking that all of us together as as a collective body we must realize that we were lost that we were gone away from god's economy this eternal plan of redemption yes amen we were a part of it in the mind of god but not down here because when those first three dimensions were set up when adam did what he did it slowed everything down and it just absolutely stuck us in this place but thank god for foreknowledge that he foreknew all that and he could put a place that he could have a fourth dimension that he could have a fifth dimension that he could have have a sixth dimension one faster than the other and even faster inside because we're going to see here tonight in the fifth dimension you've got to be careful right the fifth dimension is for the sin or dead but you got to remember only the redeemed go in the sixth dimension so where you gonna put the fullest version you're gonna put them in a burning in hell no you're going to put them in another place amen i'm going to read you here where the bible talks about a fifth sealed jew that they are somewhere crying how long how long huh right they're not in the fifth dimension they're crying how long because we thank god for the opening of seals we know who those people are they're sitting in a place what about a cup of water in my name they're going to be given eternal life they're going to be part of this eternal plan of redemption but where we're going to put them right we'll read some of this and we'll see all right so let's go i hope you love more today than you did yesterday i hope you love the lord more i hope he's i hope he you know at night now that we have so many people to pray for i'll just be honest i was honest with him up there i'll be honest with you i might not get the list finished before i fall asleep but you know what i didn't get finished a couple nights ago brother gary you know what happened two o'clock in the morning of course i had to go to the restaurant but still i was and i said oh i forgot to pray for this one and that one and this one and that one so hey you know what that's okay but you know what he loves that glory god loves for you to pray we should be a more prayerful people than ever before the bible says pray without ceasing so pray over everything even when you go in a restaurant or go in a grocery store and all the different things you pray that god will protect you uh we were um watching a little program while we were up there in illinois on the on the tube and it was these this man went around just kids were disappearing right under people's noses and they found out that he was a he was right there in the neighborhood and he was killing those kids and i'm just saying that you never know we need to be vigilant understand that god will protect you if you ask him to that's that's what makes me more i pray for my granddaughter all the time now you should pray for all yours that are getting and going in different directions and being able to go here and being able to go there and being able to drive a car oh goodness i'll give you gray hair when a 16 year old gets behind a wheel there is mercy and grace though so we just need to keep praying praying for them pray without ceasing all right number one job is the oldest book in the bible it's supposed to be written before moses we already read this but i like reading it again because look redemption is one of the oldest things in the bible so you can look back to all the different things that you want to in the bible read it has to do with redemption it doesn't matter what you're reading if even if it's rahab if it's talking about some of the worst people even ahab is in that plan of redemption because somebody like ahab had to be here and jezebel had to be here there to type here and that same spirit listen that spirit just come off of him and went into somebody else come off of him and went into somebody else amen so that spirit we're fighting those same spirits but you know what i believe you and i got something to fight it with i don't think we're using it as much as we should but we got something we've got an open book to fight him with there's no corner satan can hide in there's no word he can hide under because you know what he likes to hide in the word with those two spirits we were talking about that's where he likes to hide he's not hiding in the hockey thoughts he's not hiding in a strip joint he's hiding right here trying to do what he can to defeat you he's already got these people think about that folks when you go down and you look out at these people and you wonder what what purpose brother brown said cattle and fodder cannon fodder but you know what that's basically all they are right just take up space and one day they'll go out of existence please don't be that way if you get the baptism the holy ghost they ain't enough fire they ain't enough atomic weapons they ain't enough guns they'll ever get rid of you if you get the baptism in the holy ghost in your soul because that thing is eternal you can't kill it what the holy ghost come for to give you that assurance to give you that assurance that what we are part of this redemptive plan back in the back part of god's mind if brother branham would have uh let me say this if he would have stayed there long enough he'd have seen all of us but i believe when he went in the sixth dimension that's where he went he went in the mind of god because he saw all the people that were in the mind of god before the foundation of the world that had died under his ministry now remember he didn't see everybody just all the ones under his ministry all right so job is the oldest book in the bible redemption is one of the oldest things in the bible you know that redemption was the plan of redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed think of it and i want you to think of that look at all the things that happened in the old testament that we would think as dad was covering the other day that we would think that god should have went ahead and just destroyed david literally a murderer and he didn't murder somebody he hated he had his best guy right the guy was so loyal david was trying to get him to go home right to be with his wife so that he could cover up his adulterous act and the poor guy remember he said no i'll stay right here i'm gonna just lay on the floor and i bet that grounded old david too but remember he still did what he did you know why because he didn't have the baptism of the holy ghost if he had the baptism in the holy ghost that would never happen but covered under the blood of bulls and goats knowing that calvary was going to eradicate that one day that would be the eternal plan of redemption amen god foreseeing and making a way of redemption before he even made the world you know why because he knew it was going to fall just as soon as the thing started all right and he made this plan he didn't i was thinking about this coming down the road yesterday he didn't develop this plan while we were here he don't do that the plan was already developed before any of this ever got started because he saw it all start and happen and finish up and he says okay this is the way we're going to do it wow you just got to make sure you're a part of it titus 1 says paul in hope of eternal life we'll just kind of skip through these real quick i don't want to be be too late in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promise before the world began who do you promise it to he swore by himself he didn't ask the second person he didn't ask the third person he didn't even ask an angel and he didn't ask lucifer because lucifer didn't care so he swore by itself he said i'll do it i was reading in deuteronomy and and uh i think we got some scripture somewhere but it talks about that how god said i'm gonna bless you you do all this and i'm gonna bless you but if you do all this right here i'm going to curse you in deuteronomy manifem people could have just stayed in that part over here but you see though you see though the plan of redemption though because you see they didn't do hardly any of this they did all the bad but god had a provision for him he's got him locked away in that fifth dimension thank god for a prophet thank god for the open book that we can see that that fifth steel jew is somewhere crying how long how long to avenge our blood not talking to us not talking to gentiles he's talking they're talking to their brother the jew that's still on the earth today so that scripture is going to be fulfilled while we're when we're gone but we see it already we know where they are we know what's going to happen we know what group is going to be killed and we know what group is calling how long how long to avenge our blood let's go to ephesians one you know remember that we'll go to verse four according has chosen us in him now we kind of hung on that this weekend a little bit more we were chosen in him not of him before the foundation of the world that we might be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved well it looks like there's not much not much room for sinning are they there's not much room for you or not dirty rascal no he's already paid for it it's already done you he and he knew whether you would ask forgiveness for it or not he knew you would or would not ask for forgiveness so in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has to bounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence look having made known to us i like that i've been reading that a little bit slower look having made known unto us the mystery of his will us the mystery of his will whatever that was in the back part of god's mind whatever that plan of redemption was wherever it went wherever it fell you and i can track it all the way now from before genesis all the way to the future home all right and you know what that don't make your head swell that makes you dig a little more to say god have i missed something have i missed a piece have i missed a piece in my life that i'm not living this plan that i'm supposed to live but you know what he saw you do that or he saw you didn't do it because you know what as brother brown said the holy ghost is a very timid individual he'll just let you continue on he gave you the spirit of adoption but if you don't want to climb that ladder it's up to you god's not going to drag you through a tube and pull you through it too no no no it's according to you but it's going to work to his perfect will as we see right here to the praise of the glory of his grace when he has to accept we made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins wherein he has to bound it toward i like that word having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure we are which he has purpose in himself i think god has fun amen i think he has fun i just don't think he's some you know we think you you look at these the way man depicts god he's this something you can't touch and he's like you know he's just no god's moving god's in action god knows what he's doing he knows the next step so he's right there omnipotent i'm pr i'm the president knows all things knows when you need it when you don't need it having made known in us the mystery of his will look that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one so who's he gathering it into the bride amen he's not gathering into a church he's not gathering into a building he's gathering into one group of people the bride of jesus christ you and i are recipients of this eternal plan of redemption and without the baptism of the holy ghost you don't have anything eternal there is nothing else eternal but the baptism of the holy ghost in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will let's read romans 8 verse 28 we know all things think we we want to uh pray for brother joe on his way back but brother richard some of them are in the back we thank them for taking over and doing the work everybody working together and we know all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren you know i read i read my most famous quote that always brings eyebrows up like this where brother brown said in adoption he said jesus didn't come to bring you an inheritance oh buddy there was a a couple of them i mean i said i said i love before you get before i make this quote i know what you're going to do you're going to do like this well two of them was like because jesus didn't come to britain he didn't come to you know what brother i'm saying jesus didn't come down here to develop an inheritance or to develop a plan while he was here it was already developed before the foundational world we just lost a way to get back that's why he said straight as a gate that's why he says i am the way that what the way back not not that he developed it down here right ah he died to get us back to the plan that was already before the foundation of the world i read that quote where brother brother brown said no no no jesus didn't come to bring me an inheritance he didn't come to bring you an inheritance and boy like oh my goodness and i read the quote to him i said jesus he said jesus came to get us back to our inheritance because our inheritance by foreknowledge was before the foundation of the world amen for those who did four knew he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren thank god that this plan doesn't change it's a never-changing plan it never changes so you know what it's not like see the devil will bring a plan to you and he'll get you but see if god works on you for a little while he's got to change it god doesn't satan has changed his plan he's got to change his tactic and go a little different way i swine so sneaky but god just says trust me believe me i died for you son i died for you daughter just believe what i've already done more over whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called he justified when he justified them he also glorified now we'll skip these two because one of them is on predestination we've already been through that brother dale's been over it we know by foreign knowledge looks back to destination and then in number two and that raised a few eyebrows too but i read the quote anyway because you know there is a quote where brother brown said you always were a grain of wheat you got to know what he's talking about though you got to separate the mind of god with what you were born down here amen everybody got that that's the whole problem they can't get them separated but when you read them this quote right here says in questions and answers in 1964 after the seals broke how can i take a cup of water and make a grain of wheat out of it now brother brown you said we always were wheat well in the mind of god we always were weak but you a cocker bar all of you stinky cuckoo bird june and i we're walking through the woods looking for some uh for those of you that don't know what a deershed is a deer sheds its horns every year so they drop in the woods and we try to find them and we did find one but anyway so we weren't talking about something jensen then looked and she said kookaburra it had stuck and it stuck on my side but it was a cocker bar and it was sticky it stuck me that's the same way you are you always gonna be sticky if you're looking for for complete perfection you ain't gonna get it right till the body changed brother brown said you're going to be sticky your nature as long as you're in this life down at the bottom as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature but what's happened yes brother dale deals with all these sticky cuckoomers but he knows down in most of us is a wheat germ and if we have to put you in the grave we put the cuckoo bird in the grave we don't put the wheat germ in the grave and when it comes back up guess what by the transforming power of jesus christ that's going to look like them downstairs and it's going to be what full wheat but there's going to be a group of people that this cuckoo bird is going to be changed to a wheat all the way through from inside out amen and i say this to be to be honest we're waiting on that right because the bible said paul says waiting to wit the redemption of the body we're we're waiting while we're moving it's not we're waiting we're not waiting in the waiting room for the baby to be born no baby's here but we're waiting and not getting ahead how many times brother brown said many people go ahead of god's program try to go ahead of god's program what does he say you see scrap heaps of ministers what trying to push the plan trying to push the plan without what holy ghost virtue knowledge temperance i was telling them up there and brother tim said he'd never seen it that way before but remember brother dale preached on the statue of perfect man not too long ago and he took all the definitions and the definitions that man has for these virtues is different than the definition that that brother branham brought for these virtues amen it took a profit to do that so now we're not looking at this going well now virtue is is just being a virgin no that's not what he said he said that's having what power that's having strength holy ghost strength that's holy ghost knowledge that's not the knowledge of man that's not not drinking alcohol because that's what man says temperance means in the webster dictionary but when you bring a prophet now he said no no no that's not what that means he said that's controlling your ungodly temper same way with all these others and i really appreciate that and so did they maybe it'll spark some of them to start studying a little more because if you read all the definitions of these it's just you know you really get confused because if you're born again you're already a virtu you're already a virgin in christ so why is this right here that's why people get all this confused but if you'll take virtue as what the prophet said knowledge is what the prophet tells us temperance is what the prophet tells us beautiful picture thank you lord virtue is strength virtue is what strength that you give to somebody else and without the new birth what brother i'm saying he said you write the check he said that there's nothing in the bank insufficient funds but remember if we've got it if we've got the baptism of the holy ghost you can't out you can't outright the checks that god give gives you no way you can out give god so you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and all the sin has gone from you see that's the thing and as brother bob was talking about sunday afternoon that's what the holy ghost was given for if the holy ghost is not given we're just all pure huckleberries and we're all going to hell but you can still be a cuckoomer and have the holy ghost inside of you and be pure weep and listen that's a mystery that's why i was thinking about coming up down up the road down the road that's the mystery the greatest mystery is that you did what you don't do what no more you don't now that old man i remember he used to cuss we had a discussion about that in the dentist office the other day i gave him a testimony about how that i was going to say a bad word and remember the lord hit me right in the chest and thrown all the air out of my out of my lungs so i couldn't say it why because that old sticky nature i was leaning to i was talking to somebody in the world and i this has been 15 years ago but god will tell you he'll put you somewhere in a place you were before and if you don't do something different you didn't get different back then amen but you know when i believe god gives you little markers along the way that you can say the things i used to do i do them no more now it doesn't listen i'll be honest with you i used to curse really bad they still run through my brain we're humans amen right let's just be honest we're cuckoo birds our memory reason conscious affection imagination has still got kookaburra sticky on it your soul doesn't but see that man we need to let that man take over and he'll push all that other out now listen we'll remember what we did and we'll let things run through our head listen but remember before you were born again what did you do you had a four inch pipe from here down to here and you just let it roll right but the holy ghost is giving you what or something to close that thing up with and i thank god for that but you can't help it to go through your brain that's where the sticky part is brother brown listen brother brown's not telling you you're going to be a sinner all your life he's telling you that you're going to do things wrong you're going to remember the things you used to do but god does not remember them and the holy ghost that's inside of you didn't do it anyway so why what's he looking at me no if i have the baptism of the holy ghost i thought the bible said first first scripture said by his blood right we have forgiveness of sins and it doesn't just forgive us it eradicates it right it doesn't go it doesn't keep going to god now see satan's over here trying to keep throwing it up but you and i i don't know why i'm getting on this i'm not getting anywhere but that to me that's the whole thing that's hindering us is we just don't think we're good enough because we think like we used to think let those things run through your head but let them run out the other side amen i start singing hymns every once in a while start quoting scripture start saying i love you lord right and you'll see the old devil he can't stand it let's go to the dimensions and look real quick remember light time and matter we looked in in luke 16 and i want you to see something now remember as we spoke on before i want you to remember this that remember you and that you and i listen in in theophany form was created first we weren't people we were attributes because if you don't then genesis 1 26 is wrong genesis 1 26 says let us make man in our own image and in our likeness that was me and you but remember then it comes down to adam and adam was a spirit man first because he could contact god through that spirit form with no limitations then he took adam in genesis 2 7 and put him in flesh see takes phil smelling here but remember it didn't do away or detach that person that he was the spirit realm first right in other words like i said it didn't change him no he just put what brother i'm saying he put that spirit into the 2-7 man the flesh guy to contact the earth by what sea tastes filled smelling here but remember i read you the quote before brother brown says god does not all those five senses you can fake them amen jim makes a hunting soap for us for deer hunters it smells just like dirt but it's liquid in a bottle that's a deception it's not dirt smells like dirt but you know what i like dirt it's liquid but man by chemical has put the things together and all these other scents that you smell and you think man i'm in a rose garden and you open your eyes and it's a bottle of lavender yeah that they've synthetically produced but see that's the way satan is satan is what he's an impersonator see tastes filled smelling here don't ever depend on it but remember as bob was saying sunday though if you connect to the eternal then your vision changes you don't look at that woman anymore you don't taste that beer anymore you don't feel the things you used to feel the beer can you understand what i mean so what's he done he's just took out the old nature put in the new nature and you still got your five senses so the five senses and that's another eye opener they had i said look tell me how many times your flesh has sinned and they're all going oh man i said zero your flesh only reacts to what's inside of you we know it was born in sin it was a product of sin but your flesh is not what you need to worry about remember what god said in the scripture he said do not fear the man that can kill you in other words you fear the man that can kill the soul so that soul has got to go into another dimension like we were talking about it's got to go through a fifth dimension it's got to be either being a sixth dimension because it's going to have to fifth dimension is going to have stand judgment sixth dimension you're judged down here you don't have to stand in judgment look at this wonderful plan that god set up for all of us right if we'll just believe it but we were made spirit man first brother brown i didn't bring the quote but brother brown said now spirit so he could contact god see you can't contact god with your flesh right remember your flesh don't contact your flesh is five outlets that whatever's inside of you uses amen the inside man's the control tower he controls the memory reason conscious effects and imagination and your body just moves because that inside god tells it what to do but remember now that you've got the baptism of the holy ghost you grab water before the baptism from the holy ghost you went got you a beer or some liquor you understand what i mean that's why the holy ghost is the most important thing because down inside of you is what matters this right here doesn't matter this thing right here is what's inside because what's going to happen this thing's going to separate into a grave if you have to go by the grave and if you don't have the baptism of holy ghost you still got to go pick that back up and be and be judged for what you did in this flesh not of the flesh because look then you and i are in pri in trouble we all were born flesh we all have to carry this thing somewhere think about that we have to carry this thing somewhere when mom and daddy brought it here we got trapped in the first three dimensions everything's slowed down we can't go through a wall we can't what contact the fourth dimension we can't we can't just do like adam and control the whole world we wish with the holy ghost but we can't we're trapped by what adam and eve did we it trapped us into the first three dimensions and we have to go through time we have to go in tight listen time always equals death because there's no time in god but time always equals death if you go through time you're going to die that's why there's even time in the millennium because there's people going to die at the battle of gog and magog at the end of it there's people going to die that's why you're still in the old seventh day by the baptism of holy ghost we've all been moved into the eighth day sitting in heavenly places let's realize that stop sometime and just say thank you lord thank you for giving me something i didn't even want oh no you searched all your no you did not scumbag all of us telling them that up in tennessee we we were all married we all had marriage problems we were born married to the wrong person born between satan and eve doomed and on our way to hell but listen you still got to take your flesh somewhere it's either going to go in a grave the soul is going to go to a dimension but wherever that pair wherever that soul is got to come back and pick that body back up that's why god thinks so much of you he's not going to separate you but just for a little while if you have to die it's not going to matter just for a little while you're going to be in the sixth dimension but you're going to come back and pick that body back up that's why i do not believe that you're going to get a new body as far as another body no you were born with this one god loves you in this body that you're in if you're full of the holy ghost you know why because you don't know what i just got this the only way you can show the world the whole world does not know jesus christ but you do and you're the only one and how you going to manifest it oh but y'all just y'all all boy yeah admit it we're all born in sin right right but by the transforming power of god amen he put the wheat in the cuckoo bar you can't do that if i plant them taters tomorrow i'm not gonna get pineapples right but you know what if god wanted pineapples he could change the life of that tater and make it a pineapple but you and i can't do that but god can't and he said he'd change even the vilest of sin or he'll change you you may think your life's falling apart not if you got the holy ghost today your kuckleberg may be falling apart me about it i've been to the doctor more than two weeks this last two weeks and i've been in my life so anyway but you know what it's because we were trapped in this dimension by adam and eve and what the devil did the devil had to come into this dimension to do what he did amen look in luke 16 verse 25 says but abraham said son remember that our in that lifetime receiveth thy good things now we're going to use this scripture again when we get into the sixth dimension because according to the excuse me the prophet of god there was a a space called paradise that the old testament saints were caught in which is not the sixth dimension because remember when we'll get to it not today but later when the witch of endor brought samuel up he wasn't a young man turned back he was still samuel with the prophet's robe on right so the so going into paradise was just a holding place because look the blood of bulls and goats couldn't take that soul of samuel and turn it back young again right right but now when you come over here and you let the prophet of god go behind the curtain of time after the baptism of the holy ghost has been given after the sixth dimension has been set up for for the people that have eternal life then what were they all young people young men and women some people he didn't even know because they were that 90 year old woman was 90 years old the last time he saw him but she was 20 years old in this dimension look at the difference look at what god's done with this eternal plan of redemption is so perfect but he tells here it says abrahams because they did call paradise look up the word paradise in the bible it's only like four times but you see that it's also called the bosom of abraham which is the place it's not abraham standing there you know lazarus wasn't laying but just a story read listen to the story but abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetime receiveth thy good things and likewise lives was evil things but now he is comforted and thou are tormented and besides all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed so that they which pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from this in other words there's no way to pass between this dimension is locked in and this dimension is locked in amen because you know what it's the plan of god why would you just why would you just you know everybody that dies he just they just dumped them into one place he wouldn't be a just god if he did that right because the judgment of what they'd done like brother man we'll read hearing about the fifth dimension he said that sinner's caught between the two world he's caught between can't go back to earth and he can't go to heaven or the sixth dimension he's caught in between that why because he's sinned here right the way the tree falls that's the way it leans you know in other words if you're a sinner here now there are provisions to get eternal life i know that but listen if you're adolf hitler here you're going to raise adolf hitler and you're going to go to the white throne judgment okay there's no uh there's no see you got to have judgment i love it when people preach on god being a good loving gracious god i know that but he's also a judge he's not a granddaddy he's a daddy and buddy if you get out of line you're going to pay for it remember brother brown says you sent a sin as a christian you will reap a tub full amen thank god for a prophet that can explain these things gloria and that he could it helps us in our everyday life not just it you know and we we glory that that we have an open book but just even to be a normal christian the prophet of god helped a lot of us just live through certain things to get through things that we that we would have never got through if james dobson not saying anything about them but just the big names max liquido and all those different ones i brother branham's to me that's good enough he's good enough for us to to put our faith in what he said and uh know that he is uh he's fallible but his the word he brought was infallible amen all right so now this we were on for knowledge so we get done with four knowledge we're done with that and now we're on the dimensions now let's go to the present stage of my ministry number one now when we come along we remember that we live here in three dimensions now brother brown tells us what they are one of them is light the other one is matter tommy you remember these adam but it's not adam it's time light matter and time and our five senses contact these dimensions our sight contacts light our feeling contacts matter and so forth in other words we've come from from now we've all become after adam and eve did what they did we all come down to where we have to be born in this dimension we can't travel between dimensions now god can come into this dimension and talk to us that's what he does that's why i said you don't get a revelation in this dimension these first three dimensions is just a temporary place what for us to develop this plan of redemption for god to develop it to the human being and give them a choice and then after that is where it starts splitting up into the different different dimensions all right has everybody got that so we become solid we become light we have to have light to live we have to have the matter we we have to have some sort of matter to put this building together to put the car together to eat you eat matter all right the things that we do to sustain this life we had to have but remember it's all contrary to god the light he wants you to see is the light he created before the world before he created the sun and the moon that's the sustaining light we're looking for and also we're looking for what the matter and we're also looking for what time to be no longer time to be temporary and then all of a sudden time will go away didn't brother ram tell us one time and this is how strange because you you wonder you think man poor old uh abel's been dead for what six seven thousand years he's the first one to die and have to go into one of these dimensions he was the first one to have to die he's been dead a long time you know what brother brown said one time he said martin luther he said he when he resurrects it will be just like he laid down and went to sleep the night before and woke up the next morning why because we're in time six thousand time years has went by but abel's probably going man when he starts when he resurrects he's going like it was just yesterday oh thank god i mean thank god that that's the way it is martin luther that'd be wonderful him to wake up and go i was only asleep you know just today it's like some of y'all sleeping now wake up and it might be tomorrow saying no more on that one okay so now let's look john 12 verse 28 the reason i'm bringing this right here though is to tell you what happened from a different perspective what happened in this church age all right that happened in no other church age that we can record that it happened it's that god brought a message to a prophet and there was noise thunders there was lightning there was voice of god there was a cloud everybody got that the reason that is is because god came into this dimension with a message he came from a faster dimension which is in eternity he came to hear because look what brother brown said let's read john 12 father glorify thy name then came their voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by and heard it said it thundered others said an angel spoke to spake to him brother branham was standing on the rock that day and remember the whirlwind comes down over him and it makes all kind of noise it bursts rocks everywhere and he told the people to get under the get under the uh truck and you know hide in the bushes when it was all over what'd he say it was it was just a bunch of noise to them brothers they scared to death and here stands a prophet right in the middle of it rock's going everywhere and god's talking to him he come from eternity into this slower dimension and gave brother random a revelation he said hey what did he do he threw that rock up in the air and he said judgment will strike the west coast and in 1964 alaska like the sunk into the ocean that was god speaking to a prophet now you and i listen you know i don't we love to talk about these experiences but you and i are going to have to have an experience where god's thunders to you you've got to have a voice of god that we're because look let's let's let's analyze that just for a second that's okay because look he said john john 12 28 says father glorify the name trying to get this right because i thought about it a minute ago and i've lost my thought then came their voice from heaven saying i have both glorified and glorified again so in other words he brought him a message the people that were around him though heard it and said it thundered others said an angel so they were in contention about what was being said right but who was he talking to he was talking to jesus who was the angel that knocked paul off of the horse he wasn't talking to the little people that was around him though it be maybe this guy was a captain and this guy was a good preacher but he came and spoke to paul right but now what did paul do with it though here's the whole thing paul took that message that he got from god to the world that's the same thing with me and you that right there how did he glorify the name look i have both glorified it what at that moment and i'm going to glorify it again that means that that same man inside of a bride is going to hear a thunder it's going to hear a voice of god it's going to get a revelation that's going to take us into another dimension amen and there's going to be people standing around you how many people stand around you oh here's my thought back again how many people stand around you on a daily basis and don't understand you don't understand how why what do you mean you don't what it's god can speak to them the same way speaks to you but god has given you the opportunity for him to speak to you but all the all the other people here's noise thunder see a light maybe see a cloud a lot of people saw that cloud millions probably and millions have seen it afterwards that book's going for like 300 a copy now the the book that that was the picture of it was in what does that matter i mean really but you know what it's a sign to me though that god came through a dimension and came down and give us a cloud and that we can not just it's not just you know that when we first come in the message you know they was trying to pick out all the things where you can see the horse rider right here sitting a man sitting on the horse there's a horse's legs oh and they were showing us the eagle and they were like you know oh boy this has got all kind of all kind of symbols in it that's okay but did they get the voice behind that most of them did not they got blinded by the light and even in revelation 6 1 says when i lamb opened one of the seals i heard it was what the noise of thunder the noise of thunder one of the four beasts said come and see and we know that the next one is in jehovah gyra 1961 we were talking about sound barrier the other day any time the sound barrier is like 700 miles an hour anytime you break through the sound barrier there's always a noise and there's always a vapor cloud made by it if you'll watch and see when chuck yeager you can see the the picture of when he broke the sound barrier back into whatever was the 60s you see this big cloud now it's not shaped like that but it's a big cloud goes all the way as soon as he broke that sound barrier there was vapor went everywhere and the sound barrier what went off but listen it happened because somebody believed they could break it if you'll read a story chuck yeager they always get to about 600 miles an hour in some of the other test flights and the things start shaking so bad they think it's gonna break in half and they back off chuck yeager read a story he said when it started he said i still had plenty of throttle left and he just put her forward when he did and let's read this right here sometimes when you get a place you battle can break to that sound barrier as they tell me when a plane is trying to get through the sound barrier it just almost shakes the bolts out of it but after getting through the sound barrier it's all right then it can just run with ease if you can just break through that static of superstition and things then the holy spirit just begins to fall around like anointing and blesses the people but so many people of today are so babied so petty little petty what they pull back on the throttle when your world starts shaking push that baby forward break through that sound barrier and you'll get a cloud and brother branham then is this a sign of the end sir look here real quick i'm going to paraphrase if you don't mind you can paraphrase scripture but boy they don't want you to paraphrase quotes bless their heart but remember the analogy there was little bitty birds there was bigger birds and they were coming at a certain speed but remember when he got to the very last one it was what angels and they came he said they came from eternity let's go down to paragraph 205 but it shook the earth remember there was a what go to 204 first a blast and i thought it sounded like a sound barrier ever what you call it when planes crossed the sound and the sound comes back to the earth just shook like roared then i could have been it could have been a great clap of thunder and lightning like i didn't see the lightning i just heard that great blast that went forth that sounded like it was south from me towards mexico but it shook the earth and when it did i was still looking westward the way off into eternity i saw a constellation of something coming it looked like it might have been little dots there could have been no less than five no more than seven but they were in the shape of a pyramid like these messengers coming and when it did the power of almighty god lifted me up to meet them and they were angels traveling faster than sound could travel paragraph 207 they came from eternity in a split like a twinkling of an eye how many of you have got a revelation and it just shake your soul that's god coming from another dimension he's breaking through this slow thing that we're in he's breaking through this huckleberry that we got around us he's breaking through our memory reason conscious effects and imagination and he's going right down to that soul and he said here i am this is what that's why i think brother branham he was so happy i believe he they told him go back to jeffersonville and these things will be told to you in other words there'll be things told to you that never has been told before the book still closed but now we're getting ready to open the book and william branham you're the only one that's going to hear it at this moment everybody all right with that but he did get a revelation and he did deliver it to the people you and i and he said it went like but when he came back i was reading in questions and answers on on the seals he said i've never worked in a realm like this before never ever and i mean what has he been through millions of people being healed because he's in 1963. he said i've never worked in and he walks through the pulpit never gets really excited millions of people turn him down can't hear the thunder they might hear the thunder but they never heard the voice that was beside that and that was the problem they didn't hear what they were supposed to hear because what happened they did not have the right receptor they did not have the right crystal as we were talking before so let's go to the fourth dimension which is the tree of knowledge or science or the fourth dimension now look the fourth dimension can't be seen but it can't be manifested okay it can't be seen you can't see the four this dimension you can see life time and matter you can see that fourth dimension is radio waves there's something moving so fast i remember i was telling it's 300 billion ohms per cycle is one of the highest ones it can just go through it can go through concrete barriers that are hundreds of feet thick they can contact submarines that are 20 miles down in the ocean because what it travels so fast it breaks through all this stuff that we got and gets right down to where it needs to go you know what that's limited man's ability what about god because god listen god uses that fourth dimension you use it all day telephone radio press play you can't see his voice you can hear it though by a receptor that picks up the voice and gives it to me and you let's look at them before now but we have contact through science the fourth dimension as it was because coming right through this building now comes pictures voices of radio pictures on television that our senses do not contact that but yet you have a tube or a crystal that picks up those ether waves and manifests them you see right in this building now is live actions of people in the air live voices they're here we know it they're absolutely the truth and the only thing you do they catch it on i don't understand the mechanics of it of these things that science has invented but we know that it proves to us there is a fourth dimension look at number five now we have no there is another dimension which is the fourth dimension because science has probed into it and found it it is radio there's no senses of our body can detect radio or television over that ether wave so see it's not your body your body is just in this dimension your body's just to hold all your guts together all right because you manifest for what's inside right through here is coming television pictures but we have nothing in us no way at all to contact that in our self it takes a crystal he keeps talking about a crystal what is that we all of us older ones we know what that is that's a piece of a diamond way back when there was a crystal a piece of a diamond a victrola needle joe pulled me up some quotes and i didn't bring it with me but i got him back there where he talks about brother brown talks about victrola needle what is it it's a diamond that's cut a certain way and only that diamond can pick up that sound sound familiar read this it takes a crystal of some sort a magnet to contact that but it speaks that there is another dimension now that's four dimensions number six enticing spirits now this morning we're going to talk about demons in spiritual form in the soul they're in the soul the same as they are in the body and we're bound to admit that we see them in people's bodies such as cancers and different diseases that's in the human body now i want you all to remember what brother brown talked about in 1955 remember he interchanged soul with spirit he's talking about the spirit realm if you're born again you don't have demons in your soul if you're sick today if you even if you had the worst cancer in the world it's not in your soul okay it's in your it's in from contacting your spirit realm and then what it manifests in your body everybody got that okay talk about demons in spirit form in the soul so we mean spirit they're in the spirit the same as they are in the body and we're bound to admit that we see them in people's bodies such as cancers and different diseases that's in the human body just recently even cancer has been declared to be a fourth dimension disease listen all demons travel in the fourth dimension that's the part they travel that's the door that was opened amen that let them in but remember god's got to come through there too then it's another dimension sure it's demonology every disease every disease he didn't say just cancer every disease is a fourth dimension disease the beginning of it now let's read number seven real quick questions and answers on the seals this is the one where part of that that i was reading today don't try to make yourself odd to be a christian because you see you take yourself away from god now what's he doing he's he's went through six seals wake up he's went through six seals and he's getting ready to preach seven seal and he has questions and answers he knows they're not getting it right okay he knows they're not getting it because of the questions they asked about pantyhose and pajamas to bed when he's supposed to be answering nothing asking no questions but on the seals he said that about three times no question only stick and should women cut her hair should women wear pajamas to bed you know what he had a whole lot more patience than i did he answered every one of them and took the whole time to answer every one of them okay just saying don't try to make yourself odd to be a christian because you see you take yourself away from god if you can understand it this is that third pull you should have caught that the other day you remember there's no impersonation like there is was of the other two see the first and second pool so that's as far as you should know now just remember that you see now there's something taking place in this room and there's something here there's actual in this room look watch what he says angels voice of god amen you know what he's telling them he said if you can hear what i'm saying it's god speaking to you straight to you not through somebody else just speaking straight to you to get the revelation and they didn't get it but how do you you can't if you can't hear the natural voice look if you can't hear the natural voice without something to send it out how are you going to hear the spiritual voice wow he cut them to the bone and they didn't even know it he yeah he but he was gracious that was a gracious man to do that because he knew it wasn't for them because later on he'll tell you it's gone from you it's not even for you all right for that group of people but it is for us now you might make me make believe that somebody is singing this certain song that might not even be there see but when it actually strikes the crystal there he is again that it's supposed to strike what's he telling him the right crystal's not there yet that's what he's saying because if it had been there they would have heard the voice of god and they would have got the revelation that's why he said it wasn't for them when it strikes the crystal that it's supposed to strike then it gives a true interpretation and vindicates it by showing the picture see what i mean now the spirit of god when it speaks through the two word true word it vindicates itself to show itself that it's right you understand now all right what was he telling them the right crystal's not here yet you've got a crystal you have picked up the voice of god you need for your day you've picked up that you need the baptism of the holy ghost you picked up that you need to live right that you need to try maybe to go up the statue of perfect man but these seals are not open to you but where are the crystals i'm one okay i'm one y'all can leave your hand down all you want leave your hand no leave your hand down cause you don't believe it i'm one of those crystals i was three years old i was still sucking a battle but you know what i had representation so did you some of your parents weren't even born in 1963. but you had representation that the right crystal was coming and it would be here tonight if you don't get excited by that then this there's just really nothing if you don't see how that absolutely if you don't see predestination right though your head will be this big i was just always something ain't no way i can get out of it i'm just right here i was born and bred for it you be careful because i was born in sin i was a sinner doomed and on my way to hell but you know what god give me an angel because back before time he saw me want it right he saw me in 1997 he he saw me want it i was done with all them other things i was dealing with i would had been successful i had wonderful wife still more wonderful now than ever a couple of kids and i i didn't have a grandkid yet yes that girl up with me but you know what i didn't have jesus christ but there was a crystal that came to me about six months later hopkinsville kentucky where i'm going to uh this weekend on lake malone when god filled me with the holy ghost he brought that crystal sure i could hear i could hear the different voices i i could tell you about serpent seed i knew that what happened in the garden you didn't have to tell me but brother braham said that's just the ability to read i can read where it says repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sin that wasn't something that just got added after you got born again why it always was there and then when that always was crystal met you at your day of your new birth the two omnipotents met oh come on people brother brown said when two omnipotents meet when that holy ghost that come from the mind of god and come down and filled you with the baptism of the holy ghost you got a crystal inserted inside of you that nobody else gets that kind of crystal because that crystal might not be a preacher crystal it might be a teacher that crystal might be just a good housewife that crystal might be just a good guy with a lunch box under his arm going to work sitting in the pew and unlike some of you say amen i mean you know you gave me a lot of other things amen what we say but look now the spirit of god when it speaks through what the true word see now your your crystal though is set for the true word that's why when you hear faults and when you hear error what happens something goes off in other words that in other words that whatever comes from that other dimension the true word of god is in here planted and then you hear something coming from a different direction and it hits your crystal and you know what happens you know what happens when when you you turn the dial and the old am ready radio what'd you get if you didn't get a station that's all you got static that's what it is it's static you can't understand what he's saying that's why when bob was preaching that i was i was having a hallelujah time that's what the holy ghost is for that's your crystal and it's a crystal that he gave just you it was cut out of the big stone not made by hands all right now just for a minute we're going to cover the fifth dimension which is hell now remember as we said before most people think hell is burning at the moment it is not there is no such thing as a burning hell at the moment okay it's the fifth dimension and we're going to read it right here look number eight present stage of my ministry brother brown says now the fifth dimension is where the sinner the unbeliever dies and goes to the fifth dimension is kind of well the horrible dimension now this man when a christian dies he goes into the sixth dimension and god is in the seventh dimension now then you see the christian when he dies he goes under the altar of god right into the presence of god under the altar and he is at rest now at this time brother brown's already been across the curtain of time because it was 1960 when the cross occurred in time so he knows what he's talking about paragraph 25 to break it down when a man has a nightmare he's not altogether asleep neither is he awake he's between sleep and awake and that's what makes him have a horrible shaking and screaming how many of you have a nightmare can you imagine not waking up from the most horrible nightmare you've ever had and it just keeps reliving it over and over and over again like brother brown said there's no there's no foundation it just keeps you just keep dropping to break it down when a man has a nightmare he's not all together asleep and he's awake he's in he's between sleep and awake and that's what makes him have a horrible shaking and screaming because he's not asleep he's not awake to that shows where a man goes when he dies unconverted he's lived his time up he's dead on earth and he cannot go into the presence of god because he's not fit to go there without the blood and he's caught he cannot come back to earth because his time is finished here on earth and he's caught between and he's in a nightmare scene he can't go in the presence of god to rest he can't back come back to earth because his time's up he's in a nightmare and there he stays like cain until the day of judgment a horrible thing to be in number nine the countdown then i think the fifth dimension is where the sinner dies where he goes now i think that when the sinner dies he goes into this fourth dimension eight you know he means fifth notice the first thing he cannot go into the presence of god because he's a sinner his time's up on earth if i could type it for you it's like trying to go to sleep when you're in a can't be asleep you're in a nightmare hideous things you're screaming you're just all that's the state of the wicked dead he cannot go into the presence of god because he's a sinner he cannot return back to earth because his time's up and he's caught between the two things in the fifth dimension he's got a soul and he cannot go in the presence of god because it's not covered by the blood he's a sinner he cannot wake himself up because his time's up on earth so there he is in a tormented nightmare it's just because we're told because the two consciouses are passing sub and first conscious and it catches between and that's the nightmare when a sinner dies he's caught with a soul between earth and hell in a nightmare there he stands let's read first peter 3 verse 18 says for christ also hath once suffered for sin the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison because remember he walked down there to the spirits in prison they weren't burning they were in hell but they weren't burning he went down there and talked to the devil talked to preach to the souls that were in prison which sometimes were disobedient which once the long-suffering of god waited in the days of noah while the ark was prepared when few that his eight souls were saved by water in other words eight souls went across seven million and seven billion people died they say it's as it was in the days of noah so so it is today so there were seven billion people died and they're all down in this one place called hell or pla fifth dimension look at number 10 souls in prison now jesus after he finished his ministry preached to those souls that were unsavable that cannot ever be saved now listen why can't you say well that seems like predestined that means he pulled them through a tube no they made a decision and he knew they would make that decision therefore he could do what he did to be a righteous judge now the bible tells us that he went and preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not when mercy was given look you say oh they didn't have a chance see it looks like they were unsavable could never be saved but look watch this when mercy was given to them they spurned it and now they're waiting for the judgment oh what a time that must have been oh i wish there was some way i would shake the world with that to let them see what the reality is souls in prison again paragraph 108 but after the days of his preaching his ministry continued on because the last group he preached to was the souls that were in hell that could not be forgiven i have clearly read that from the bible here from ii peter see he went and preached to the souls that were in prison which is hell locked up until the day of judgment because you see the judgment isn't now there's no burning hell now somebody tell you the guy is in burning hell now that's wrong and why let me ask you you see what he said because he's a righteous judge he's got to give them an opportunity to present their case if they die they go into this dimension they're in a place of holding he's got to resurrect them bring them back to the white throne judgment and be judged for the sin that they did but they got to all stand judgment that makes him a righteous judge that's wrong a judge of this earth is just enough to never condemn a man until he's brought to trial and god will never throw a man into the fiery furnace until first he is condemned by god's own laws he rejected mercy so you see he first has to have a trial and the trial is the great white throne judgment but now he's in a place called a prison house as i saw the vision of both places by the grace of god i say this not to be sacrilegious and if i'm wrong god forgive me i believe i've been in both places and i seen the redeemed the blessed i seen the lost and where they were at and that's why i stand as your brother today to warn you to flee from that downward path don't you ever go that road glorify jesus let's read this one and then we'll then we'll stop right here say here is a line like this and then there's all mortals on this side or that side men are influenced by one side this side comes from god this side comes from the devil now let's just take it a great conglomeration of blackness anxiety and muck and sin and divisiveness of this world every once in a while you'll see a little white spot that's a christian like a light now those that are in darkness are influenced from beneath those that are lights are influenced from above now when you leave either one of these channels in other words when you leave this world or any one of these channels you go into the realm of spirit this is the mortal realm the dimension that we live in now because see the fifth the fourth dimension fifth dimension the sixth dimension are all different worlds okay now if you go this way listen close if you go this way the first dimension is the spirit of the dead now remember you got to remember he's in that fifth dimension telling you there's a dimension inside of a dimension because the first dimension is clearly not hell sometimes we may think that it is but the first three dimensions are time light and matter but the first dimension in the spirit world is the spirit of the dead peter spoke of it in prison that repented not by the long suffering of the days of noah the wicked unregenerated man when he dies his spirit goes into this realm look the next round below that is demons the next round below that is hell so there's different stages even in the fifth dimension where are you going to put the foolish virgin where are you going to put the cup of water in my name you're going to put them in a different place because they're not going to be in that place i don't think that's he said that's the unsaved people the people that are unsavable in other words they've already made their choice so they're unsavable but that's your fifth fourth and fifth dimension let's stand to our feet musicians come and we'll look next time we speak we'll talk about the sixth dimension we know more about it than any of it because we have a connection to it because that's the holy ghost if you got the holy ghost you got part of it here that's why you go there the reason they the reason the the unsavable don't go there is they have no connection they have no part their parts down here they've lived their time listen if you're not saved tonight you better check yourself i just told you this is real this is not something fairy tale exactly you're going everybody's going to have to give an account about what they do except they're redeemed and we're still going to have to give an account of some of the things that we do as christians because sometimes we a little need a little slap on the hand but it's not to put us in this hell it's not to put us in this fifth dimension but if you die tonight and you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost that's where you're going and you're going to stay there until the judgment happens and guess what the dead lived not for a thousand years you've got an extra thousand years that you're gonna have to stay dead because we're gonna be redeemed we're gonna rise and we're going to walk through that dimension and all the sinner dead's got to stay dead for another thousand years past until the white throne judgment but thank god he's give us a hiding place he's give us a place we can go and if you've already went there you're very familiar with it that's why my brother brandon went across the curtain of time he was pretty familiar with where he was at he was kind of had a few questions because he's looking at his cucker bear laying on the i mean looking at his body yeah brother brian was a cuckoo bird don't worry we were all huggaburst okay all born in sin there was only one wheat plant that was born a wheat plant and that was jesus christ amen everybody got that but he still had what he took on yokobur he took on your sin and died for me and you let's turn around and give it back to him let's give him the glory let's sing a song god bless you [Music] [Music] i will raise [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] a gathering in [Music] think [Music] [Music] [Applause] then the angels all will listen for they cannot sing that song when they redeem our gathering air or wintering or gathering [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay [Music] are gathering in we're watching snow and free from all sins i will shine i will sing [Music] you know part of that song we always know that we we know and hear it it says the angels all will listen you know they're gonna have to stand back and watch a group of people see now these angels they can move they can move through all dimensions they're uninhibited satan sends them out and god sends them out so be careful but they they go through all the dimensions but you know what when they come to that time when we walk down that street and we go into that city i believe they're just going out to line the streets and they're going to stand there with arms folded and they're going to shake their head and wonder what are these people singing about we don't know what we don't we never was went through any of that we didn't have a a bill that we missed or a job interview that we didn't get or or just think about anything in life that's part of redemption your life is a part of the plan of god your whole life you saw when i was a sinner yeah that was part of it it gives you purpose amen and as brother brown says it gives god purpose to have this kind of plan and the plan that he had was to include me and you and each one of us have that crystal inside of us if you're born again tonight you have that crystal that receptor that you can receive from god where the guy sitting beside you cannot or the lady sitting beside you at the grocery store on an airplane or on a bus and they're just thinking about all the evil stuff and all the howard second wife and third husband and all this different stuff and here you're sitting there going when they redeem our gathering in and they're going redeemed what do you mean and you know what turn around talk to them about it tell them how god saved your soul tell them how your fire got lit brother brian said if you can't do anything just tell them what tell them how you got a new crystal go back and explain to them say hey you remember you know you the mo victrola 45s you know you had to put the needle in the end of it and that needle picked up that but without that needle right it just went right and that's the way sometimes we go through this earth and when we were not born again our whole life was right but when god stuck that crystal in us we knew who he was talking to and we knew what he was talking about let's bow our heads to heavenly father we thank you for this day thank you for the purpose that we have here and i pray that every one of us will see our purpose we'll see our destination lord and that you'll touch each one of us lord in our natural body but also lord in our spiritual body we all need help we all need a little more nourishment from you lord so as we go home

choice we thank you for that lord we know that many people have spurned that and turned it down over the years millions and billions of people have but thank you father that you met us one night one
