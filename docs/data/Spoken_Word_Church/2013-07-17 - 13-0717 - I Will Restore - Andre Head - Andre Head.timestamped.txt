[4:13] the prophet had turned and looked up at
[4:16] him
[4:17] said that god healed speech impediment
[4:20] and so
[4:21] my wife she went back because that was
[4:23] the first person she had met
[4:25] that personally had received a word
[4:28] directly regarding healing so she went
[4:31] back and told the believers in in
[4:33] venezuela and so

[4:54] from that time the work that god has
[4:57] given us through

[5:03] come up and i know brother george kind
[5:06] of lending his son out to the mission

[5:52] fellowship with all the wonderful
[5:54] brothers and and uh and and we've we've
[5:57] seen each other grow in the revelation
[5:59] of jesus christ and
[6:01] so thankful that god has a body of
[6:04] believers that are stabilized and
[6:07] certainly a time like this and
[6:09] and we we know who we are
[6:11] and what we've been raised up to do in
[6:13] this hour and so we certainly thank god
[6:16] for the family of god
[6:18] before we get started in the word uh
[6:20] my wife and i we we got back from
[6:24] venezuela april the 11th of this year of
[6:26] course i don't have to tell you if
[6:28] you've heard any kind of news you know
[6:30] that
[6:30] the president of venezuela chavez passed
[6:33] away earlier this year and the country's
[6:36] just really in turmoil the inflation and
[6:39] just just a real
[6:40] tense situation there in south america
[6:43] now
[6:44] but we my wife and i we arrived
[6:47] april 11th actually we were doing more
[6:49] work starting to do more work
[6:52] in northern brazil
[6:53] a few years ago i met a wonderful
[6:55] brother his name is brother
[6:57] marcio de gama and he's from manaus he
[7:01] was born and raised in manaus brazil
[7:04] and
[7:05] many years ago the lord led him to
[7:07] venezuela he established in churches in
[7:10] venezuela a wonderful pastor in
[7:11] venezuela but the lord took him back to
[7:13] brazil
[7:15] and a couple of years ago
[7:17] he was having a
[7:18] uh um a convention
[7:21] and an in uh in the eastern part of
[7:24] venezuela and he said well andre i'd
[7:27] like for you to come and be a part of
[7:29] the convention well we came and after
[7:31] that he said i want to take you over to
[7:33] brazil i want you and your wife to come
[7:35] to brazil and and so we went over and of
[7:39] course he passes the church and
[7:40] announced there and we had some
[7:42] wonderful services there and boa vista
[7:45] and monas a couple of other places and
[7:48] so the lord blessed me there
[7:50] and this last year he said now brother
[7:52] andre i want you to come
[7:54] i want you to come
[7:56] and it's just tremendous
[7:58] and you know here and i'll i'll just be
[8:01] just plain with you
[8:03] the five-fold ministry
[8:07] this is the holy ghost in action
[8:10] it's you know man can put himself up he
[8:13] can try to establish himself he can have
[8:16] all the credentials he wants to
[8:18] but god has a ministry
[8:21] and a ministry that is directed by god
[8:25] it's not hit and miss hope so maybe so
[8:29] god has a ministry in the earth
[8:32] and he's he's perfecting his bride
[8:35] the message has been preached but it has
[8:37] to be taught and people have to be
[8:39] positionally placed in their position to
[8:42] know who they are in their inheritance
[8:45] because the book of redemption has been
[8:47] been opened seven seals christ has taken
[8:50] the seals off of himself we know who we
[8:52] are
[8:53] the abstract deed people are holding
[8:56] abstract title deed in their hands
[8:58] to life what adam fell from they've been
[9:01] restored back to that right and just
[9:04] waiting on the adoption to wit the
[9:05] redemption of our bodies and all of the
[9:08] these great things that the leadership
[9:10] of eternal life is bringing us into
[9:13] because you don't know the things of god
[9:15] by intellect you know the things by the
[9:18] holy spirit leading you into the word
[9:21] leadership
[9:22] brings the very mind of god to the bride
[9:25] and it's our soul so god in his father
[9:27] ministry
[9:28] just directed
[9:30] precisely
[9:32] to where they need to be
[9:34] to to to meet the need of the body in
[9:37] this hour and how wonderful that god
[9:40] has done this not through manmade uh uh
[9:44] uh uh
[9:45] uh knowledge
[9:47] but through revelation and through
[9:48] humility and the body of his word
[9:52] and so brother marshall he said bro
[9:54] andre i want you to come
[9:55] come again and so
[9:57] i said well
[9:58] i told my wife i said he called
[10:02] i said brother mark said i won't be able
[10:04] to make
[10:05] my wife's mother needed the surgery
[10:07] many things had come up
[10:09] and we had to get ready to come here
[10:11] turmoil in the country there
[10:13] i i said call brother martin and tell
[10:15] him i won't be able to make it but deep
[10:16] in my heart i felt
[10:19] you got to go
[10:21] and i wanted to go but you see the last
[10:24] thing you want to do on the mission work
[10:26] or anywhere
[10:27] is to try to do god a service without it
[10:29] being his will
[10:30] you want to find the mind of god the
[10:33] leadership of god
[10:35] people are out there doing all kinds of
[10:37] things in this day
[10:38] and look at the day we live in man in
[10:40] his conceptions
[10:42] of what he thinks god we don't need man
[10:45] in his conception of what he thinks god
[10:47] we we don't know we we are in a message
[10:49] that will transform us
[10:51] and if we're not hearing from god we're
[10:53] just we're becoming foolish virgin
[10:55] material when we don't want that
[10:58] we want to be hearing from the throne of
[11:00] god
[11:01] we want to the the the holy ghost
[11:04] leading into a different atmosphere
[11:06] a different dimension
[11:09] oh eternal life not something laying out
[11:12] there in the future but eternal life
[11:14] opening up and god by seven seal coming
[11:18] leading his children not how much i know
[11:21] or who can out quote somebody else who
[11:23] but god by seven seal coming
[11:27] opening his word bringing the believer
[11:29] into a higher dimension than humanity
[11:32] than what man conception can think of
[11:35] and we're thankful that that we have a
[11:37] god who knows how to lead his children
[11:41] how to bring the unwritten word by the
[11:43] seed word planted in their hearts
[11:46] that's so wonderful when a people and
[11:49] god looking to an end to bring a victory
[11:53] his victory that's who you are
[11:55] his victory
[11:56] the bride she is the very absolute of
[12:00] the bible she's the end of the bible
[12:02] she's the amen of the word of god
[12:05] in this last hour and that's a wonderful
[12:07] thing to be a part of that
[12:09] and it's wonderful because we know that
[12:11] we didn't make ourselves a part of it
[12:13] but the predestination and the
[12:14] foreknowledge of god through election
[12:17] chose
[12:18] positionally placed us called
[12:22] anointed us
[12:24] and that's a wonderful thing
[12:26] and so i you know i said brother marcy
[12:28] i'm not going to be able to come
[12:31] and so we hung the phone off
[12:33] i told my wife i said sweet
[12:35] let's pray
[12:37] and we did
[12:39] and after we projected you call brother
[12:40] martial
[12:41] so brother martial israel andre
[12:44] when do you need me there yeah
[12:47] he said brother andre
[12:48] he said i'm gonna have to apologize to
[12:50] your wife but we want to get you as soon
[12:53] as possible
[12:55] and uh because my wife's mother had to
[12:57] have an operation and oh how the enemy
[12:59] just used that thing
[13:01] but god
[13:02] god took care of that and mother didn't
[13:05] have to have the operation god brought
[13:07] his healing power on the scene that's
[13:09] right
[13:10] that's right
[13:12] and so he said you're going to have to
[13:13] go to manaus and and we have the
[13:15] plaintiffs you're going to have to fly
[13:16] down to baleen you're going to be there
[13:17] for two weeks and you're going to be
[13:18] here i said okay we're we're gonna come
[13:21] and so we're excited about coming but i
[13:24] had what in venezuela i have what's
[13:27] called a cellular and that's like a a
[13:29] visa a
[13:31] permit for me to be there and the dates
[13:33] were running out and they were clashing
[13:36] with the same dates that i was supposed
[13:37] to be in brazil and so i thought lord
[13:40] what am i going to do and and
[13:42] oh my
[13:43] just bureaucracy it's just a mess there
[13:46] and just chaos and so i thought lord
[13:49] help me what are we going to do and so
[13:52] when we got over to brazil
[13:54] in february
[13:56] we we were actually in a place called
[13:59] santi elena and that's on the border
[14:01] between venezuela and brazil
[14:04] and so i had my sailor but the days were
[14:07] running out maybe i had one week
[14:09] before i was supposed to get another
[14:11] cellular a new visa from venezuela but
[14:15] we me and my wife we had taken care of
[14:17] this work we had been two months earlier
[14:21] a month earlier we had all the
[14:23] documentation we had paid more but yet
[14:26] they just one excuse after the other
[14:29] excuse and i thought hello
[14:31] what's going on here and so when we got
[14:33] to brazil they they said well let's look
[14:35] at your papers and they looked at the
[14:37] papers we're at the front here and the
[14:40] the the the guard there the the the
[14:42] frontier guard they're just
[14:45] so
[14:46] staunch and and so rough
[14:48] and they looked at the paper and said no
[14:50] you're not going to be able to come to
[14:51] brazil
[14:53] even though you're an american you as an
[14:55] american you should have got a visa when
[14:57] you're in the united states
[14:59] you see you're trying to come from
[15:00] venezuela even though your wife's a
[15:02] venezuelan and you have a sailor here
[15:05] and we permit the venezuelans to cross
[15:07] with a cellular it looks like your dates
[15:09] are running out
[15:10] and i said i tried to explain to him
[15:12] look the reason my dates are running out
[15:14] is because and see here they gave me
[15:16] this temporary and they just didn't want
[15:18] to hear it
[15:19] and i thought well and brother marshall
[15:21] said i don't know what we're going to do
[15:22] because even even this night brother
[15:25] andre in bora vista we got meetings and
[15:28] you got to be there we got an
[15:29] interpreter coming all the way from
[15:30] announce and
[15:32] and and so brother martial talked to the
[15:35] to the the the the uh like the
[15:38] superintendent there of the border
[15:40] patrol and he said no there's nothing we
[15:43] can do for you
[15:44] you what you should do just go to go
[15:46] down to the the the brazilian consulate
[15:49] which is in santellena it's only 15
[15:51] minutes from here and tell them you need
[15:53] a visa there so we went there but
[15:55] because they have what's called carnival
[15:58] and they they call in louisiana mardi
[16:00] gras they have that big carnival
[16:02] throughout south america ain't none but
[16:04] a bunch of reverse
[16:06] and uh so we went there and they said no
[16:08] we're close because of money because of
[16:09] mardi gras
[16:11] so you're going to have to come back
[16:12] next week
[16:13] and then you're going to have to wait to
[16:14] this
[16:15] and we thought mom
[16:17] so
[16:18] brother mark so he said you know we've
[16:19] exalted every means to to get this visa
[16:23] we don't know what we're going to do and
[16:25] of course we pray and we we thought the
[16:27] lord and i said well
[16:29] i'll tell you what brother marcel
[16:31] i i i know somebody that can touch god
[16:34] he said who was that i said my wife
[16:38] she know how to pray
[16:39] i i said let me call her
[16:42] and he said it's not brother he said we
[16:44] believe in prayer but we've we've been
[16:45] up there bro andre
[16:47] and brother martial called my wife she's
[16:49] there she she knows these things and
[16:51] brother marcio hear the tape you know
[16:52] these things are true
[16:55] brother martial said what are you going
[16:56] to do bro andre i said let's go back
[16:59] once more to the border patrol
[17:01] let's go back once more
[17:03] so he called my wife
[17:05] said i said sweetheart
[17:08] i told her what was going on oh my
[17:11] that visa they they didn't do your
[17:12] papers and
[17:14] so i said sweetheart
[17:16] i don't want you to pray
[17:18] lord
[17:19] please let my husband into brazil i said
[17:22] don't pray that way
[17:24] pray
[17:26] thy kingdom come
[17:28] thy will be done amen not god let my
[17:32] husband in
[17:34] pray our father who art in heaven
[17:36] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[17:41] i said pray that way yeah
[17:43] because i don't want to do god a service
[17:45] if you don't want me to go here brazil i
[17:46] don't want to go to brazil and so we
[17:48] went back to the so so we went back to
[17:50] the frontier policeman
[17:54] and when we got there
[17:57] you know
[17:58] you know when when god moves for you
[18:02] when god moves through it for you you
[18:04] just have to take it you know
[18:06] i mean god will move for you and it's
[18:08] like god he moved for me but god he he
[18:10] moves for you but he ain't just giving
[18:11] it to you like ice cream you still got
[18:14] to take it
[18:16] that's right
[18:17] you got to take everything that you have
[18:19] you've got to possess it you got to put
[18:22] the steak down say this is mine god you
[18:24] promised it lord he loves that and so we
[18:28] went back and
[18:30] it wasn't like the the border patrol and
[18:32] everybody just bowed down to me
[18:34] went back and there was another officer
[18:37] in
[18:38] and and and when we came this one
[18:41] officer said oh no this guy he's already
[18:43] been here twice
[18:45] and
[18:46] the chief said he can't come in because
[18:48] his papers are not right et cetera et
[18:49] cetera et cetera
[18:51] and the other guy who was sitting beside
[18:53] him who was higher ranking than him said
[18:56] well what's going on
[18:58] and they discussed what was going on he
[19:00] said sir i'm sorry you just can't go in
[19:02] we just can't permit you you're gonna
[19:04] have to get your paperwork done might
[19:05] take you a while but but you have to do
[19:08] it and i said sir we're going to abide
[19:10] by the the sovereign laws of brazil
[19:12] we're not trying to try to get in there
[19:14] and sneak in we're going to abide by
[19:17] your laws and things he said sure yeah
[19:19] this is the right way
[19:21] and so
[19:23] he uh and so
[19:25] brother martial said you but you have no
[19:27] law
[19:28] that could permit this man to come in
[19:30] because he's married to a venezuelan
[19:32] venezuelans come in all the time so
[19:34] why can't this guy come in he said no of
[19:37] course he is he's a matter of views but
[19:38] he's an american he doesn't have a visa
[19:40] from the united states he can't come in
[19:43] and so but he said but you say oh he
[19:45] said i'll look at the books i'll show
[19:47] you
[19:48] so he began to look
[19:50] through the
[19:51] through the like the the state
[19:52] department for the for the for the visas
[19:55] and and what permits you need and and
[19:57] what kind of uh of waivers they could
[20:00] give to to cross over and so he um he
[20:04] looked
[20:05] and he looked and and then
[20:08] this other woman came up and and got in
[20:10] the argument with him and and man i just
[20:12] thought man
[20:14] lord
[20:16] i just sit there
[20:18] and then i thought eric then he said you
[20:20] know i believe we got something here
[20:23] and he said no no that won't work for
[20:25] you
[20:28] oh my
[20:30] that's a that's a quantum to be in a
[20:32] real situation to be in
[20:35] and
[20:36] you know over the years 18 years we've
[20:38] been by god's grace
[20:40] doing work throughout venezuela and
[20:42] through mexico and through colombia and
[20:46] through the islands of the trinidad i
[20:47] remember when brother steve and i had to
[20:49] get on a ferry and
[20:51] and go from trinidad to
[20:54] to to grenada there
[20:56] and the boat that we got on we didn't
[20:58] know it was a drug smuggling boat
[21:01] and so when i went back to trinidad they
[21:03] said you rode this boat to grenada i
[21:05] said uh yes sir said throw your passport
[21:08] away
[21:10] that boat has been under investigation
[21:12] you don't want anything to do with that
[21:14] but but yeah they took it it got me
[21:16] there and got me back and different
[21:18] things like that but but this was a real
[21:21] trial here though
[21:23] and so i just weighed and i thought lord
[21:26] well maybe i'm just not supposed to go
[21:29] or we'll just see lord
[21:31] we'll just wait and so the woman was
[21:34] arguing hey and the man
[21:36] and then finally just
[21:37] she just kind of left she got her things
[21:40] together and i thought
[21:42] and then i heard that this chief who had
[21:45] already said no that morning maybe he
[21:47] was coming back in now
[21:49] and i thought well he if this man a
[21:51] hurry up and rush it but you see god
[21:54] god's not about rushing things
[21:56] god god ain't trying to god's not trying
[21:58] to force a peace where it doesn't belong
[22:00] he doesn't have to do that
[22:04] he's sovereign in himself
[22:07] he he has direct control of his ministry
[22:11] that's right and when they get out of
[22:13] line he knows how to bring him back in
[22:14] line there yes he does
[22:17] and so
[22:18] the the gentleman he looked
[22:21] he said
[22:22] he said we have a we have a clause here
[22:27] that a brazilian with authority said
[22:29] brother he said excuse me sir he's
[22:31] starting to brother martial he said are
[22:32] you a pastor
[22:34] here in in brazil and brother marshall
[22:36] said yeah i pulled out his credentials
[22:38] he's registered with brazil so yes sir
[22:40] i'm a pastor here
[22:41] he says we have a clause here
[22:44] that says if you will take full
[22:46] responsibility
[22:48] you can take this man for 10 days
[22:52] and oh my blessed be the name of the
[22:55] lord
[22:58] so so so i got the paper and and then
[23:01] they stamped it and then the gentleman
[23:03] said you have him back in 10 days if
[23:05] he's not back in 10 days then you're
[23:07] going to be in trouble he's going to be
[23:09] in trouble also said no brother marshall
[23:12] said no we the last thing we want to do
[23:14] is cause problems we don't want to cause
[23:16] problems
[23:17] and so what happened is we had to take
[23:20] from from the border there we had to
[23:22] take a little taxi to
[23:24] bora vista and so what happens when you
[23:28] pass through
[23:29] the the
[23:30] the borderline about a mile down the
[23:33] road
[23:34] there is another security and it's there
[23:37] in case someone sneaks through the
[23:39] border then they have to go through this
[23:41] other uh guard office like a national
[23:44] guard
[23:45] there and so when we went there
[23:48] we drove there i was sitting on the
[23:50] passenger seat well martial his wife was
[23:53] sitting in the back and the driver there
[23:55] and the policeman
[23:57] he came around with
[23:58] with his guns pistols and his guns very
[24:01] intimidating he walked around and looked
[24:04] at the driver just look stare at him to
[24:06] let know you know
[24:07] i'm the man here and
[24:10] walked around looked at toe brothers in
[24:12] the back let the window down
[24:14] then
[24:15] he walked over to where i was
[24:19] he said get out of the car
[24:22] so i got a car
[24:24] he said give me your papers
[24:26] getting the papers
[24:29] you looked at them
[24:31] enjoy your trip
[24:36] thank you lord
[24:38] thank you lord amen
[24:43] you just have to go through those
[24:44] experience to understand they they
[24:46] really try you and and sometimes you
[24:50] think everything's going to be smooth
[24:52] and all lottie dotty but it's not that
[24:54] way
[24:55] you have to know
[24:56] you have to you have to know that god
[24:59] has called you in this hour and so lord
[25:03] i believe we're supposed to go there
[25:05] but if we're not we're not going to do
[25:07] anything illegal we're not going to do
[25:09] something we're not we're going to wait
[25:11] on the lord and so we did and god gave
[25:14] us a wonderful trip there we were in
[25:17] brazil for 34 days and my mother's my
[25:20] wife's mother
[25:22] she was getting
[25:24] really having a problem
[25:27] and the lord hadn't moved manifested her
[25:29] healing and so my fam my wife's family
[25:32] they were putting pressure on her and
[25:34] her mother was putting pressure
[25:36] and the enemy said you need why you just
[25:38] run off and leave your wife you need to
[25:39] get back there you get back there and
[25:42] help her i said sweetheart i love you
[25:45] i'm praying for your mother
[25:47] i've got to obey the word of the lord
[25:49] i've got to press on and god showed us a
[25:52] great thing in that always put the lord
[25:54] first always obey his word first
[25:58] he loves to try you that way to see
[26:01] if your desires are to him but we had a
[26:04] wonderful trip there we were in brazil
[26:06] for 34 days
[26:08] and
[26:08] lord willing i know a lot of people ask
[26:10] brother andre when are you going to be
[26:11] headed back
[26:13] really i don't want to sound
[26:15] uh juvenile or
[26:17] or childish
[26:18] but really as a missionary
[26:21] as a missionary for 18 years
[26:23] it's not just what i do it's who i am
[26:26] you see brother dale he's not just
[26:28] pastoring he's a pastor you see that's
[26:31] his calling in life
[26:33] and so for you to say well brother andre
[26:36] are you going to come down you're
[26:37] settling down
[26:38] how does a missionary settle down
[26:41] how how do i do it
[26:43] do i do i'd say well okay i'm not are
[26:46] you doing mission at all i'm just up
[26:47] here in east tennessee just just
[26:49] surviving now
[26:52] that's not who god made me to be so but
[26:54] i know it sounds elementary to say uh
[26:58] well when he and and i'm saying that
[27:01] putting myself in your shoes
[27:03] really you you have to just wait on the
[27:07] word of the lord and what we're doing we
[27:10] we're writing a letter to brother
[27:11] martial because venezuela has the word
[27:14] of the lord that country has they they
[27:18] hold that word stronger than any south
[27:21] american any any latino country
[27:24] venezuela is strong with the word they
[27:26] have the minister we and god help us and
[27:29] missionaries have come and the ministers
[27:31] there are great ministers studied and
[27:35] convinced about this message
[27:38] and so and and so even even it has stood
[27:42] when so many countries have failed
[27:46] to to ideas of men
[27:48] and and and and and different doctrines
[27:52] that are just blowing the people over
[27:55] and venezuela by god's grace
[27:58] for for the
[27:59] a better part they've held this but
[28:01] they're in in brazil and of course your
[28:04] own pastor brother brother dale has been
[28:07] instrumental for the the duplication of
[28:10] books and things like that in brazil but
[28:12] just the confusion and the mess
[28:15] that's in in brazil especially the
[28:16] southern part which i'm thankful to the
[28:18] lord not to be
[28:20] any part of that southern part but up in
[28:22] the northern part there's real hungry
[28:25] souls like i said they've heard the
[28:27] preaching of the word but they they want
[28:29] to be taught the word and the ministry's
[28:32] apt to talk there's of course there's
[28:33] teachers in the five fold ministry
[28:35] ordained teachers your teachers here
[28:38] that that can bring that work and bring
[28:40] things out of that word
[28:42] but the ministry in whole they're apt to
[28:44] teach and that's where we see the body
[28:47] at it's not the times where i used to
[28:49] tell you you remember when i just tell
[28:51] you i went down with brother cyan we
[28:54] were wrestling the anacondas and and the
[28:56] alligators there was that time we did
[28:58] that
[29:00] and and trying to avoid getting bit by
[29:02] the bushmaster and and all of those
[29:04] things we did that we have the pictures
[29:06] of that holding up anacondas we got
[29:09] there holding up alligator we got all
[29:10] that we went through that
[29:14] but but but that's not it though
[29:17] see that that's just a little part
[29:20] what is it is getting the word to where
[29:22] it belongs and where it needs to
[29:24] be and so we see in this season god has
[29:28] turned the corner
[29:29] just like we left the church ages we're
[29:31] not in the church ages we're in the son
[29:33] of man ministry
[29:35] we're we're in the we're in the the
[29:37] broad age the word aids
[29:41] it's a wonderful thing
[29:43] because the church agent look at the
[29:45] church ages today look at the church
[29:47] today
[29:48] look at the nations today
[29:50] the world is falling
[29:52] apart handwriting on the wall the world
[29:56] look at this country in a sort of my
[29:58] condition
[29:59] the president of this country
[30:01] baptized this nation with a homosexual
[30:04] demon look at the people
[30:06] it's one thing for a man to walk in the
[30:08] street and say oh we believe in
[30:09] homosexuality it's okay but when the
[30:12] leader of a land a president of a land
[30:15] who is the representative of that land
[30:17] when he pronounced something like that
[30:19] he released a homosexual demon on the
[30:22] united states now look at him coming out
[30:24] of the wall
[30:26] [Applause]
[30:28] all this perversion and wickedness
[30:30] the world and this country is on the
[30:32] side of my condition but brother brahman
[30:34] said it would be that way in the
[30:36] anointed ones at the end time he said
[30:37] three things remember three things he
[30:40] said the world will be in a sodomite
[30:42] condition
[30:44] and at that time janice and jambis would
[30:46] rise up and we see these scoffers today
[30:49] scoffing the word saying that the cloud
[30:51] was some uh rocket fuel gas blowed up
[30:55] discrediting the hand scoffers in the
[30:58] last days
[30:59] but he said also in that time
[31:02] the son of man would be revealed
[31:06] to the elected bride
[31:08] oh we know where we're standing
[31:10] we're marching to zion and so
[31:13] we
[31:14] we see all of these things
[31:16] taking place we see the mood of the
[31:19] people we see people becoming
[31:21] unconcerned about the message
[31:23] no enthusiasm people don't read and
[31:26] listen to messages anymore
[31:28] and that's you know i drill that thing
[31:30] in south america i say you have these
[31:32] books now
[31:33] and all these false doctrines are coming
[31:35] through and you're not even reading the
[31:37] messages
[31:38] you're not listening to the word
[31:41] you've got to stay in the word
[31:44] you've got to stay there these two
[31:46] spirits are too close
[31:48] and so we're trying to just when we come
[31:50] from brazil
[31:51] we just preaching there on the supreme
[31:55] deity of the the white wigged one the
[31:58] cloud the seven angels coming down
[32:00] vindicating this message
[32:03] and said now you've got all these false
[32:05] doctrines coming through
[32:06] you're not going to evade them by
[32:08] association
[32:09] just because you associate with a
[32:11] certain church doesn't bring you
[32:12] security you've got to be baptized with
[32:15] the holy ghost you've got to be sealed
[32:17] in the body of jesus christ you got to
[32:19] be you got to be in the word so that the
[32:21] bridegroom would understand who
[32:23] her husband is the bride would
[32:25] understand the bridegroom because she's
[32:27] connected with word she knows who she is
[32:31] that's right she knows she's his victory
[32:34] she knows that she will manifest the
[32:37] full
[32:38] victory of calvary that's right she
[32:41] knows that this great third pool the
[32:43] holy ghost opening up the word and a
[32:47] prophet of god standing between the six
[32:49] and seventh seal calling out abroad just
[32:52] like those two witnesses will stand
[32:53] between the sixth and seventh trumpet
[32:55] bringing israel back
[32:57] to their homeland
[32:59] we know that
[33:01] people can people can say those things
[33:04] but it takes that holy ghost
[33:06] to open up eternal life to you and bring
[33:09] you into a to a relationship
[33:12] begin to interpret the word in your life
[33:14] to express the individual
[33:17] person of his coming in your life
[33:20] he speak to you just like he spoke to
[33:21] the woman with the blood issue where did
[33:23] she read what book did she read in the
[33:25] old testament that she could touch to
[33:27] him of his garment and be made well
[33:29] where did she read that from what
[33:31] chapter is from exodus numbers
[33:32] deuteronomy this year from jeremiah
[33:35] isaiah she did not read it but the
[33:37] leadership of the holy ghost brings you
[33:40] into a dimension with himself this is a
[33:43] sealed person of his coming
[33:46] and that's why when people are arguing
[33:48] over the word i know more than you i
[33:51] cannot preach that's not even called to
[33:53] it it's an individual thing and god
[33:56] opens that brings you into a world that
[33:59] you never knew that that that your human
[34:02] mind can't interpret it and you brought
[34:05] on the expectation
[34:06] of the leadership of life
[34:09] oh my
[34:11] what a time to know that you've been
[34:13] called to these things
[34:14] by the election of god
[34:16] and that they belong to you
[34:18] and so we're thankful for that we're
[34:20] thankful that our young people
[34:23] not being religious
[34:25] but can take this simple word of god and
[34:28] say hey i believe god's word
[34:30] lord help me in school help me in the
[34:32] universe help me with my friends
[34:35] not some religious act
[34:37] not something religious put on
[34:39] but
[34:40] life we fell from life we fell from
[34:42] eternal life we fell from somewhere but
[34:45] in this last days
[34:47] god said
[34:48] i
[34:49] will restore
[34:51] and he has
[34:52] he's restored us back
[34:54] from where we've fallen from
[34:56] and that's who you are and so we had
[34:58] that wonderful time in brazil i just
[35:00] want to share that with you
[35:02] and so it's just wonderful what god is
[35:04] doing throughout
[35:06] south america
[35:07] the different countries there
[35:09] and then come back up here to united
[35:11] states see you moving with the word
[35:14] growing in the revelation of jesus
[35:15] christ
[35:16] fighting these battles
[35:18] but fighting with a sword in your hand
[35:22] the word of god deny you
[35:24] speaking the word
[35:25] in expectation of what you're believing
[35:28] for
[35:29] see so
[35:31] when when faith is positive
[35:34] then god leads you to a place where he
[35:36] can challenge you
[35:38] that's right that's what god did to
[35:39] esther
[35:40] he queen esther she didn't know
[35:43] she when mordecai said look you're
[35:45] trying you're looking for
[35:46] self-preservation you're trying to save
[35:48] yourself you were brought here for a
[35:50] purpose for such a time as this
[35:53] and so she thought just because she was
[35:55] beautiful she she kind of hide away in
[35:56] the palace you can hide away in the
[35:59] palace
[36:00] god had placed her there and took her
[36:02] from hadassah to esther
[36:04] god had done it god had raised her god
[36:06] had placed her so he could challenge her
[36:09] to believe his word
[36:11] and so she had to make a decision
[36:13] every woman that ever represented abroad
[36:15] had to make a decision rebecca had to
[36:16] make a decision ruth had to make a
[36:18] decision hacked here right had to make a
[36:20] decision you see
[36:22] they all had to make a decision
[36:23] when the word was presented to them
[36:26] would they make that decision esther had
[36:28] to make that decision mordecai wrote her
[36:30] letter said esther you know she said
[36:32] okay fast tell the whole kingdom of fast
[36:34] three ages three knights
[36:36] because i'm going to see the king
[36:38] god challenged her and the leadership of
[36:40] the holy ghost challenges you brother
[36:43] brown said when he was when he was in
[36:45] that field
[36:47] where he created those squirrels
[36:49] you've read the message prayer of faith
[36:51] go to the end there at the prayer line
[36:53] brother branham said he challenged me
[36:56] to speak those things
[36:58] but god would never challenge you until
[37:00] he's brought you to a place that he
[37:02] knows that you will react accordingly
[37:07] because he's restoring you he's bringing
[37:09] you back
[37:10] to where you've fallen from you heard
[37:12] from that theophany
[37:14] that's right
[37:15] you heard the word of god become eagle
[37:17] food to you
[37:19] and you begin to exercise your right
[37:21] your god-given rights
[37:24] in your inheritance
[37:26] because god said i am going to restore
[37:28] god he's meticulous and direct with his
[37:31] word he forgets nothing he establishes
[37:34] things set things up so that there would
[37:36] come a time you'd have to come through
[37:38] those things
[37:39] he in great creation
[37:41] god's saying let there be light
[37:44] and there was light and god said it was
[37:46] good
[37:47] and on the second day the bible says
[37:50] that god he separates the waters from
[37:53] the earth makes an expansion of
[37:55] firmament
[37:57] lifts the water up off the earth
[37:59] leaves water there you have the dry land
[38:02] he continues to create
[38:04] but on that second day he never said
[38:07] it is good
[38:08] he never said
[38:10] he goes to the third day it is good
[38:12] dry land up here animals appear it is
[38:15] good he gets to the sixth day he says it
[38:18] is very good
[38:19] why because he's created a man in his
[38:21] own image
[38:22] but god who never misses anything why
[38:25] didn't he say it was very good on the
[38:27] second day why because he knew the same
[38:30] waters that he lifted off the earth in
[38:33] noah's day he would change the chemical
[38:35] form of that send it back down in the
[38:38] form of rain and it would destroy
[38:40] humanity he never misses to be he knew
[38:43] again that those same waters that he
[38:45] brought up
[38:46] at the end of the world because the
[38:48] earth is preserved to fire that same
[38:51] elements would burn the earth over he
[38:55] never forgets anything he's meticulous
[38:59] and direct with his word amen and so
[39:02] when he gives you a promise
[39:03] and he says i'm going to make you this
[39:06] right then he's going to make you that
[39:10] doesn't matter the circumstances
[39:12] he's doing that
[39:14] the holy ghost
[39:16] the only revealer of the divine word of
[39:18] god
[39:19] is doing that

[43:31] psalms 1 chapter 1 verse 1
[43:34] blessed is the man
[43:36] that walketh not in the counsel of the
[43:38] ungodly
[43:40] nor standeth in the way of sinners
[43:43] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[43:47] but his delight
[43:50] is in the law of the lord
[43:52] that's his word
[43:54] and in his word or in his law
[43:58] does he meditate
[44:00] day and night
[44:02] and he look at the scriptures it's going
[44:05] to compare him now
[44:06] it's going to compare this man whose
[44:09] delight is in the word of the lord
[44:12] verse 3
[44:13] and he shall be
[44:15] like a tree
[44:17] planted
[44:19] by the rivers of water brother brown
[44:21] says the rivers of one water
[44:25] he's planted
[44:27] you remember jesus said whatever my
[44:29] father did not plant would be plucked up
[44:31] [Music]
[44:32] and we see everything getting plucked up
[44:34] these days except that kingdom that's
[44:37] been planted on matthew 16 who do men
[44:40] say that i the son of man am right
[44:43] that's right
[44:44] he shall be
[44:47] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[44:49] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[44:51] his fruit and his season
[44:54] that's wonderful that's right brother
[44:55] branham said
[44:57] he said
[44:58] in the message uh the the the caliph
[45:01] the the cankle the
[45:03] the palma worm the cankerworm and the
[45:05] caterpillar brother branham said priest
[45:07] in 1959. brother brown says when david
[45:09] said this he was looking at jesus christ
[45:12] he was looking at the tree of life
[45:16] and his leaf
[45:18] also shall not wither
[45:21] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[45:24] that's you
[45:27] the ungodly are not so
[45:29] but are like the chaff which the wind
[45:32] driveth away
[45:33] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[45:35] the judgment nor sinners in the
[45:37] congregation of the righteous for the
[45:40] lord the way of the righteous
[45:42] but the way of the ungodly shall perish
[45:44] may the lord add his blessing to the
[45:45] reading of his words he may be seated
[45:48] in a message preached in 1962 called the
[45:51] signs
[45:52] of his coming
[45:54] brother brown says now
[45:56] he says
[45:58] he's quoting from joel
[46:00] he says i will restore
[46:03] saith the lord
[46:04] what will i do
[46:07] i
[46:08] will bring her back to her original
[46:12] condition amen
[46:14] i will bring her back to her original
[46:18] doctrine
[46:19] i will bring her back to the original
[46:22] word
[46:23] and i will break every denomination in
[46:26] pieces
[46:27] i will bring her back
[46:30] to my word
[46:31] in 1962 it was a tremendous year for our
[46:34] prophet brother branham
[46:35] because this prophet of the lord
[46:38] had been led
[46:40] by the lord
[46:42] amen to manifest
[46:44] what was in god's mind
[46:47] and the things that god was planning to
[46:50] do
[46:51] because surely the lord will do nothing
[46:54] except he revealed it unto his servants
[46:56] the prophet
[46:57] and so in brother brannon's life when he
[47:00] got to the year of 1962
[47:03] something began to change
[47:06] and because god said he was going to do
[47:08] these things restore that bride restore
[47:12] her to the original word restore her to
[47:15] the original doctrine he had to have a
[47:18] way to do that and he was going to do it
[47:21] through the prophetic amen he was going
[47:24] to raise up the prophet the prophet
[47:27] to prophesy exactly what was going to
[47:31] take place
[47:33] and so in even in brother branham's life
[47:36] when he gets to 19 even before 1962 but
[47:40] specifically in 1962 him being an eagle
[47:44] he's an eagle
[47:47] he can look down through the church ages
[47:49] and he can see the people crying for
[47:52] revival
[47:53] trying to to have the power of god
[47:57] but he says
[47:58] how can you cry and how can you desire
[48:01] this if things has not been restored
[48:05] he began to recognize brother branham
[48:07] that the bride tree
[48:09] that had started on the day of pentecost
[48:12] the word of god that was planted on the
[48:16] day of pentecost through the ages a
[48:19] roman bug through doctrine through
[48:23] creeds and ideas had eaten away at that
[48:26] bride tree
[48:28] and even 33 years the prophet said jude
[48:32] jude who sees the condition of the
[48:35] people
[48:36] jude cross because he sees something as
[48:40] lacking he sees maturity as lacking he
[48:43] sees the concern of the people is
[48:45] lacking he says we should earnestly
[48:48] contend for the faith that was once
[48:52] delivered to the saints that's only 33
[48:54] years after the day of pentecost here we
[48:56] are some 2000 years
[48:59] he sold the prophet of god
[49:02] he knew that god was going to restore
[49:05] that church
[49:07] that bride
[49:08] and so him with his eagle eyes he could
[49:12] look down and see where men had left the
[49:17] leadership of the holy ghost
[49:20] and went after man and personalities
[49:24] and where that roman bug
[49:27] the same insect in four stages of his
[49:31] life
[49:32] that's right let's go over to the book
[49:33] of joel chapter one
[49:36] joel chapter one
[49:43] in joel chapter 1 starting at verse 1
[49:46] the word of the lord that came to joel
[49:49] the son of petanel
[49:51] hear this ye o man
[49:54] give here all your inhabitants of the
[49:57] land
[49:58] had this
[50:00] been in your days
[50:01] or even the days of your fathers
[50:05] tell ye your children of it
[50:07] and let your children tell their
[50:10] children
[50:11] and their children
[50:12] another generation
[50:14] that which the palmer worm
[50:17] hath left
[50:18] had the locust eaten
[50:20] and that which the locust has left had
[50:24] the cankerworm eaten and that which the
[50:26] cankerworm has
[50:28] left half the caliper eaten
[50:31] this is the same
[50:33] self
[50:35] insect
[50:37] only in four different stages he's been
[50:40] eating
[50:42] he at that time he began to eat away
[50:45] brother branham said
[50:47] the fruit of that tree
[50:50] because it does listen now it doesn't
[50:52] matter how much bark you have
[50:55] if that bark doesn't grow and produce
[50:57] branches and branches leaves and leaves
[51:00] fruit then it's to no avail right
[51:04] i mean you planted this apple tree
[51:06] so it's a that's a great apple tree
[51:08] there looks good and sturdy and strong
[51:12] but it's harvest time
[51:14] and we ain't got one apple off this tree
[51:17] that's why it was planted
[51:20] to bring forth apples or to bring for
[51:22] fruit
[51:24] and so brother branham said that worm
[51:26] began to eat off the fruit
[51:28] the fruit is the manifestation of the
[51:31] word in the day which you live
[51:34] because that fruit comes from the vine
[51:38] and it's the vine that energized the
[51:40] branches and the branches bear forth
[51:42] fruit
[51:45] but we see through the ages as the
[51:47] prophet said the denominations had
[51:49] grafted their organization in and the
[51:52] message blasphemous names they grafted
[51:55] their their branches in but god said i
[51:58] will chop them off because they are a
[52:00] misrepresentation
[52:03] of the original vine right
[52:05] and they couldn't produce christ
[52:07] they could produce a form of godliness
[52:10] right i was waiting on you to come bro
[52:12] thank you so much
[52:15] he got me up here looking like astronaut
[52:18] oh i am an astronaut thank you god bless
[52:20] you you're ahead
[52:21] i'm the head astronaut
[52:24] thank you so much
[52:26] [Laughter]
[52:28] listen now
[52:30] so the prophet knew he said now the
[52:33] prophet
[52:34] prophetically he could see this he said
[52:37] now
[52:38] this insect
[52:39] has eaten off the fruit
[52:42] and then after a while
[52:44] it began to eat the leaves
[52:47] the fellowship
[52:51] and then after a while it began to eat
[52:53] the bark satan knows what he's doing
[52:57] because god said this is my army
[53:01] i sent this among them
[53:03] see
[53:05] he sent them amongst them but listen
[53:07] there should have been a ministry in the
[53:10] land that would have combat that beast
[53:14] i'm talking about this day now
[53:16] there should have been a ministry that
[53:18] could stand with the discernment of the
[53:20] end time message and discern the two
[53:23] spirits and say this beast
[53:26] it's an insect
[53:28] it's a roman beast
[53:32] but it it but then it began to eat away
[53:34] at the bark
[53:37] that's the doctrine
[53:39] and then after the bart
[53:41] they begin to eat away
[53:43] suck the very life
[53:46] all the way down to a stomp brother
[53:48] random say
[53:51] all the way to a stomp
[53:54] brother branham says in this message
[53:56] here
[54:00] the message is the restoration of the
[54:02] broad tree
[54:03] he says now listen closely
[54:05] now there was listen now don't miss this
[54:07] now
[54:08] there were four messenger four death
[54:12] messengers
[54:14] or would you rather we should close
[54:17] would you rather this morning congress
[54:19] says no he says now listen real close
[54:22] now look
[54:23] there was four
[54:25] four
[54:26] death messengers kill that tree
[54:29] that's right congregation says amen what
[54:32] was it the palmer worm the locusts the
[54:36] cat cankle worm
[54:38] caterpillar
[54:40] is that right amen four messengers
[54:43] of roman devils
[54:46] dogmas
[54:47] killed that tree
[54:49] one took its fruit
[54:51] one took its bark or took its leaves and
[54:53] one took its bark and one took the life
[54:57] is that right amen four
[54:59] messengers
[55:00] of dogmas
[55:02] kill the tree
[55:05] all but the roots
[55:07] and if for messenger of death kill the
[55:10] tree
[55:11] four messengers of life restores the
[55:14] tree
[55:15] now let me let me stop and say this
[55:18] we live in a very intellectual age
[55:23] i mean we do
[55:25] people are very intellectual
[55:27] people know
[55:28] many things
[55:29] and if they don't know what if you don't
[55:31] know you know if you don't know
[55:32] something what do you do you google it
[55:37] you google it
[55:38] and then you then you come back like you
[55:40] know it
[55:41] said yeah i'll tell you what it is
[55:44] say
[55:46] i know what you're saying i googled it
[55:47] too
[55:50] we saying the same thing
[55:54] listen now
[55:56] so with the intellectual mind
[55:59] satan has
[56:01] stepped into this message
[56:04] because he is intellectual
[56:07] that's right
[56:09] and he knows a lot
[56:12] and he knows that if he can get you to
[56:14] deviate just one
[56:17] iota
[56:20] then he got you
[56:22] you know he don't care about you coming
[56:23] to church he don't care about you
[56:25] reading the ball he don't care about you
[56:26] reading the quotes
[56:30] you don't care about that
[56:32] but at the end of the day he wants you
[56:35] to rest upon reasoning
[56:37] right and what you think it ought to be
[56:40] said well brother dale we believe this
[56:42] well it doesn't matter what you believe
[56:44] it's what god's word said let me say
[56:47] like it doesn't matter what brother
[56:48] andre believes
[56:50] god will always perform his word
[56:53] and brother brown says the wheels of
[56:55] prophecy turn slow the cogs of prophecy
[57:00] turn slow but sure
[57:02] amen
[57:03] god will perform
[57:05] what he said he would perform
[57:08] he will interpret it
[57:10] but in this intellectual age that we
[57:13] live in
[57:14] man has conceptions
[57:18] i think it's this way
[57:20] i think it's this way i think it ought
[57:22] to be that way
[57:24] god listen any of that will be in the
[57:27] rapture
[57:28] none of that will be transformed
[57:31] that will be left here
[57:33] that's right
[57:34] but satan is trying to move us away from
[57:38] the vindicated word of a prophet
[57:43] and that prophet
[57:45] god took him around the world
[57:48] took him to south africa took him to
[57:51] india bombay there in india he he
[57:54] brother been there the whole day
[57:56] jane sheeks uh hindu all of them
[57:59] standing before him saying jesus is this
[58:02] and he's not and mohammed is the true
[58:04] brother man listen to that he listened
[58:06] all day to that and then say a word
[58:09] but when it came
[58:11] time for the showdown
[58:16] and he said now you
[58:18] bring me your worst one up here
[58:21] and you bring your gods
[58:24] see which one can give this man his
[58:26] sight
[58:29] god challenged the ignorance of that
[58:31] right
[58:32] and who produced they didn't produce
[58:34] nothing
[58:35] all their fancy speeches
[58:37] all their fancy sermons all their into
[58:40] all their dogmas all all their
[58:43] psychology what did it produce nothing
[58:48] we don't want to find ourselves in that
[58:50] situation in the time of the rapture
[58:53] we don't want to find that we're leaning
[58:55] on some conception
[58:58] we want to know we're standing on the
[59:00] vindicated truth that god will not deny
[59:05] because he will not deny his word how
[59:07] can the holy ghost who wrote the word
[59:09] deny himself he cannot deny himself and
[59:11] he's not going to deny himself in the
[59:14] victory of the bride
[59:16] because the bride is going to stay with
[59:18] that word
[59:20] why because god made her like that
[59:23] god made you the way he wants you
[59:26] he leads you the way he wants to
[59:28] he interprets his word to you not a
[59:30] private interpretation
[59:32] he interprets that word by bringing that
[59:35] word to pass in your life
[59:38] right and so so
[59:40] so
[59:41] what happened they could do nothing and
[59:44] brother brown said now jesus christ
[59:45] gives this man his sight then will you
[59:47] believe him
[59:49] you know the story we've read it's been
[59:51] preached
[59:52] the man received a sign
[59:54] and the people broke their idols
[59:59] like the little
[1:00:00] deity mark thing on their face
[1:00:04] and brother i'm saying i'm so sad i have
[1:00:06] nowhere to send these people to
[1:00:08] and then god didn't just stay with that
[1:00:12] brother branham came back to the united
[1:00:14] states the intellectual giants of the
[1:00:16] world
[1:00:17] doctors of divinity
[1:00:19] great men of scholar hebrew and the
[1:00:22] greek aramaic
[1:00:24] men who who with calming words
[1:00:28] brother brown said
[1:00:30] now i know y'all got a trick set for me
[1:00:35] what were you saying brother andrew i'm
[1:00:36] saying god challenged the ignorance and
[1:00:39] the intellect of this world and it could
[1:00:41] not produce
[1:00:42] but when god said he was going to do
[1:00:44] something he does it right he fulfills
[1:00:47] his word
[1:00:49] and those that hold on to that word and
[1:00:51] live true to that word will benefit from
[1:00:55] that word why because listen now because
[1:00:58] from that word god starts to open up
[1:01:01] eternal life and lead his children to a
[1:01:05] higher order a higher dimension in the
[1:01:08] word that intellect can never come to
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:13] god does that
[1:01:15] this is not tree of knowledge good and
[1:01:17] evil this is tree of life
[1:01:21] and that's why the prophet god said
[1:01:22] that's the true knowledge good and evil
[1:01:24] its branches could only grow out so far
[1:01:28] and then it had to revert back
[1:01:30] but the tree of life
[1:01:33] continues
[1:01:34] continues
[1:01:36] and it continues to lead his children
[1:01:39] because god said
[1:01:41] i'm going to restore
[1:01:43] that tree
[1:01:45] and he has done that
[1:01:47] through malachi 4 through the prophetic
[1:01:49] he has restored it and brought the word
[1:01:52] down to his little elected bride
[1:01:57] she is the very delight of his heart
[1:02:01] and that's who you are
[1:02:03] that's what the attraction that's
[1:02:05] drawing you to the word the very mind of
[1:02:08] god and you have become the prophet's
[1:02:11] prophecy
[1:02:12] because what he prophesied this bride
[1:02:15] will be this thus this thus she is that
[1:02:19] and she receives that word
[1:02:21] and says lord
[1:02:23] thank you lord
[1:02:24] i'm that
[1:02:26] she was elevated by the process of
[1:02:28] marriage to the word
[1:02:30] the word brought her
[1:02:32] look at this morbidish
[1:02:34] woman called ruth
[1:02:37] ruth made a decision
[1:02:39] ruth had character
[1:02:41] god's looking for character
[1:02:44] she had character not like orfa
[1:02:48] orpha who's a moabitess you know the
[1:02:50] story of ruth that's the day we're
[1:02:52] living in
[1:02:53] the great boaz the kinsmen's redeemer
[1:02:58] and we see ruth right
[1:03:00] and an author
[1:03:04] their husbands have died
[1:03:06] and naomi
[1:03:08] we got three churches here three women
[1:03:10] three churches
[1:03:12] the prophet said the orthodox jew
[1:03:16] the the the the the elected broad ruth
[1:03:21] an orpha
[1:03:23] the denominational
[1:03:25] laodicea represented
[1:03:28] but ruth displayed
[1:03:31] her character right gloria
[1:03:34] because when the word was presented to
[1:03:37] her
[1:03:38] she said
[1:03:40] naomi i'm going to go with you
[1:03:43] to your people
[1:03:44] god looking at character
[1:03:47] and orpha said i'm going to stay with
[1:03:49] you also
[1:03:52] and after a while they started off
[1:03:56] they all three started off
[1:03:58] that's right they all started off in
[1:04:01] this day
[1:04:03] and in 1906 when the laodicea aids came
[1:04:07] into existence god pouring out the holy
[1:04:09] ghost of azusa street wanted to lead
[1:04:12] that church
[1:04:13] but after a while
[1:04:15] that roman insect
[1:04:18] that that roman insect still alive today
[1:04:21] i'm not preaching a history that thing's
[1:04:24] still eaten away today in people's lives
[1:04:30] say well i remember i was this and i
[1:04:32] remember but what about now though
[1:04:36] what about now my brother
[1:04:37] what about now
[1:04:39] what what where are we at now
[1:04:41] where where where's our spiritual growth
[1:04:43] at now
[1:04:45] where are we at uh spiritually speaking
[1:04:47] now
[1:04:50] so we're growing with the word that's
[1:04:51] what we should be doing too we're
[1:04:54] staying with this word that's what god
[1:04:56] wants to see because god said i'm going
[1:04:59] to do this and that broad holding to
[1:05:01] that word she said roof said now
[1:05:04] i'm going to stay with you naomi
[1:05:06] where you go i'll go
[1:05:08] your people is going to be look look at
[1:05:10] this character i read the history root
[1:05:12] listen and and brother wade preached a
[1:05:14] wonderful masterpiece on the book of
[1:05:16] ruth
[1:05:17] the jews say at that time
[1:05:20] that ruth character was so high
[1:05:24] ruth's character was so special
[1:05:28] that it even made the orthodox jewish
[1:05:31] sisters bow their head
[1:05:35] because of the character
[1:05:39] and the wisdom
[1:05:41] and the steadfastness
[1:05:44] right of her of ruth
[1:05:47] but what happened to orpha
[1:05:49] started out too
[1:05:51] and then you know what
[1:05:53] you know naomi said
[1:05:55] said orphan go back
[1:05:57] go back to your gods plural
[1:06:02] you know the story
[1:06:04] she went back because there was nothing
[1:06:07] in her
[1:06:09] her election
[1:06:11] her election drew her back
[1:06:15] just like her great-great-grandmother so
[1:06:18] who's her great-great-grandmother lot's
[1:06:20] wife
[1:06:22] lot's wife was her
[1:06:23] great-great-great-grandmother
[1:06:25] and her great-great-grandmother billy
[1:06:27] graham and oral roberts say leave this
[1:06:29] city or two angels went and said leave
[1:06:31] this city
[1:06:32] blinded the people to the door but god
[1:06:35] showing mercy on lot said take your
[1:06:38] family get out don't turn back all right
[1:06:41] and lord's wife
[1:06:43] brother branham said she she didn't do a
[1:06:45] she didn't just just you know do a a
[1:06:48] 180.
[1:06:51] she just slightly
[1:06:53] looked back
[1:06:55] just slightly looked back
[1:06:58] that's
[1:06:58] right and that caused a man who would
[1:07:02] have been polycarp who would have been a
[1:07:04] church age messenger
[1:07:06] it's a polycarp
[1:07:08] but the prophet said he leaned slightly
[1:07:13] an iranian organization that iranis was
[1:07:15] given that position
[1:07:18] so when she came out
[1:07:21] lot's wife didn't turn all the way she
[1:07:23] slightly turned and the prophet said she
[1:07:26] turned in the right now that's right
[1:07:28] so
[1:07:29] her great great great granddaughter
[1:07:33] orpha
[1:07:35] when she said i'll go too
[1:07:37] i'll go with ruth and naomi she started
[1:07:40] off a while then the next thing she
[1:07:42] started thinking man i remember i used
[1:07:43] to cut my hair man what styles they got
[1:07:46] today what situation my what church we
[1:07:49] had then no we don't have well brother
[1:07:51] dale preaches don't worry but we need
[1:07:53] some wildfire sometimes
[1:07:56] how do you know how far
[1:07:58] just stay with the word because i will
[1:08:01] restore saith the lord
[1:08:03] amen
[1:08:04] so what happened
[1:08:06] ruth
[1:08:08] who god saw character because she was
[1:08:10] steadfast even it's a it's a tremendous
[1:08:14] thing that even the ministry could not
[1:08:17] talk ruth into returning because naomi
[1:08:20] tried her best to tell ruth go back
[1:08:22] rules come to your people you have
[1:08:24] nothing here you these are strangers to
[1:08:26] you this is a strange religion we
[1:08:28] believe in jehovah and all this you have
[1:08:29] nothing in that even even naomi could
[1:08:33] not preach and make ruth turn back that
[1:08:38] tells me that no backslid preacher can
[1:08:41] make a true believer go back
[1:08:43] no way
[1:08:44] because it's in you
[1:08:46] and god placed that and by your new
[1:08:49] birth it draws you by representation
[1:08:52] it calls you and god draws you
[1:08:55] draws you to himself he sees that
[1:08:58] character and you're showing character
[1:09:01] i'm going to stay there god
[1:09:03] and god gave her trials but she stood
[1:09:06] there
[1:09:07] she had to after making that decision
[1:09:09] she had to labor a while the prophet
[1:09:11] said but after she labored a while the
[1:09:14] boaz
[1:09:15] the great boaz come into the field and
[1:09:19] saw her and she went from laboring to
[1:09:22] resting
[1:09:24] she said ruth rest
[1:09:26] and she went from rest
[1:09:28] to being rewarded
[1:09:31] and she bore a son named
[1:09:32] obed and obed
[1:09:35] jesse
[1:09:36] and jesse
[1:09:38] david now the jewish history says that
[1:09:41] when orpha went back she married also
[1:09:45] and bore children
[1:09:47] and her children children and it
[1:09:50] produced who goliath
[1:09:54] and ruth's offspring met orpha's
[1:09:56] offspring and david killed goliath
[1:10:00] that's right
[1:10:01] because they stayed with the word
[1:10:04] and god loves that
[1:10:06] because that shows the character of who
[1:10:08] you are
[1:10:09] shows what's in you what god has called
[1:10:12] you for raised you up for position and
[1:10:15] place you in your inheritance and you're
[1:10:18] standing there the prophet said four
[1:10:21] messengers four death messengers ate her
[1:10:23] down
[1:10:24] but four messengers of life
[1:10:28] would bring her back through luther
[1:10:31] uh
[1:10:32] luther wesley
[1:10:34] and through pentecost
[1:10:36] but he said then
[1:10:37] it went to the word
[1:10:39] it went to malachi 4.
[1:10:42] said brother andre we all believe that
[1:10:44] prophet
[1:10:45] i'm talking about the prophet's prophecy
[1:10:49] because the prophet's prophecy was the
[1:10:52] holy ghost telling the prophet pick up a
[1:10:55] pen and write
[1:10:58] that god was going to bring abroad and
[1:11:00] she would be an invincible a super race
[1:11:04] of people
[1:11:05] that's right
[1:11:07] and she would believe god's word she
[1:11:10] would be put to places of challenge and
[1:11:13] god would challenge her and she would
[1:11:14] respond accordingly directly answering
[1:11:18] the mind of god his brother said always
[1:11:20] wondered hell
[1:11:22] moses could tell god a better way to do
[1:11:24] things and he said then i realized it
[1:11:26] wasn't moses it was christ in moses and
[1:11:30] now the bride who is the amen of the
[1:11:33] scripture who is the very mind of god
[1:11:35] who is the inn of all types and shadows
[1:11:38] when it comes to the mind of god there's
[1:11:40] a bride in the earth that's been
[1:11:42] restored by god
[1:11:44] believing god and he has united himself
[1:11:48] with her
[1:11:49] and he has restored her back right to a
[1:11:52] position
[1:11:53] and no one's going to take that from her
[1:11:55] glory that's right that's who you are
[1:11:58] you're not going to fall
[1:12:01] you are not predestinate the fall
[1:12:04] you predestined to be conformed to his
[1:12:06] image
[1:12:07] you predestinate speak god's word
[1:12:10] and believe it
[1:12:12] and expect it to come to pass
[1:12:15] you you predestinate to stand like
[1:12:18] joshua
[1:12:20] and destroy the enemy
[1:12:22] with the sword of the word
[1:12:25] you predestinate the whole that word
[1:12:28] hold it in your heart
[1:12:30] you predestinated
[1:12:32] to move out and step on unbelief and put
[1:12:35] it under your feet
[1:12:37] and said
[1:12:38] that's not what my husband said that's
[1:12:41] not what god said
[1:12:43] this is what he says and this is what i
[1:12:45] believe
[1:12:46] and this is who i am
[1:12:48] and god has done this
[1:12:50] the one
[1:12:53] the el ella elohim the god
[1:12:58] the all-powerful one who is bound by the
[1:13:02] oath of his word right that's right
[1:13:05] who will believe him
[1:13:07] the bride will
[1:13:09] glory because all the world will be
[1:13:11] deceived except the bride
[1:13:14] and we see as we said in this
[1:13:16] intellectual age i'm closing now we see
[1:13:18] in this intellectual age
[1:13:20] that people's intellect and concepts
[1:13:23] have tried to trump
[1:13:25] the word of god right people know more
[1:13:27] than brother randomly there
[1:13:29] they don't mind telling you that they
[1:13:31] they know a better way than brother
[1:13:32] brown
[1:13:33] said well brother brown well brother
[1:13:35] branham said what he meant amen we don't
[1:13:37] need to correct the prophet
[1:13:39] but people around the message believe
[1:13:42] they can correct the prophet
[1:13:46] where's every indication right they have
[1:13:47] no vindication
[1:13:49] they don't even know what vindication
[1:13:50] means right right they don't they they
[1:13:53] don't even know the word
[1:13:55] it's just some ambition they have
[1:13:58] someone trying to be greater than
[1:14:00] someone else someone's trying to know
[1:14:01] more than someone else that's not even
[1:14:02] about it that's not this message ain't
[1:14:04] that
[1:14:06] it's christ
[1:14:07] it's eternal life
[1:14:09] it's the person of the word united
[1:14:13] with his elected bride glory and god
[1:14:17] moving you bringing you
[1:14:20] into a position
[1:14:23] you're standing there under the
[1:14:25] expectation of the word of god saying
[1:14:27] lord i don't move
[1:14:28] unless i have thus saith the lord and
[1:14:30] the message is thus saith the lord
[1:14:34] and lord it may be old-fashioned but
[1:14:37] we're going to be old-fashioned they may
[1:14:40] call me a holy roller then i'm just
[1:14:41] going to be a holy roller
[1:14:44] but i'm going to stand there
[1:14:46] let's read here in joel 2 i'm closing
[1:14:49] now i thank you for your patience with
[1:14:51] me this evening but how important it is
[1:14:54] my brother and sister when we see the
[1:14:56] things that we're seeing lack of concern
[1:14:58] about the word
[1:14:59] i mean really well why would i say that
[1:15:02] so that that i could make you upset with
[1:15:04] me why you see you i'm not trying to
[1:15:06] make you upset but people but my brother
[1:15:08] says
[1:15:09] we we got to make stands in these days
[1:15:12] we we got to shake off things
[1:15:15] spiritual amnesia all around and people
[1:15:17] forgetting who they are and and
[1:15:20] and people's rights because that's what
[1:15:22] it is the homosexual want their rights
[1:15:25] the white man wanted his right the black
[1:15:26] man wanted to drive the yellow man
[1:15:28] everybody want their rights
[1:15:31] give me mom an american citizen give me
[1:15:32] my right
[1:15:34] i have the right to do this i have the
[1:15:36] right to do that
[1:15:40] you do
[1:15:42] you have that right
[1:15:44] but the bride
[1:15:47] under this marriage vow
[1:15:51] she gave him
[1:15:52] the key of david
[1:15:55] and it's not just him having the key of
[1:15:57] david but it's the position
[1:16:01] of the key of david what was the key of
[1:16:03] david
[1:16:05] that's in a marriage brother branham
[1:16:06] said
[1:16:07] and a woman who's veiled like rebecca
[1:16:11] coming to her isaac in genesis 24
[1:16:17] she asked eliezer who is this man
[1:16:20] and he says this is the man here
[1:16:23] this is the one
[1:16:26] upon hearing that she takes her veil
[1:16:30] and covers herself
[1:16:32] brother barnum said that represented
[1:16:34] that she had
[1:16:36] no head
[1:16:37] that he
[1:16:39] was her head
[1:16:42] so upon the valve the woman that's why a
[1:16:44] woman wears a veil today
[1:16:46] it's to show that she is the body and
[1:16:48] her husband is the head
[1:16:51] not through legalist law
[1:16:53] not beating their wives up or chastising
[1:16:56] them
[1:16:58] no not through that
[1:16:59] not through
[1:17:00] law you know we was downstairs and i
[1:17:03] couldn't get this tied together i told

[1:20:31] be not afraid
[1:20:32] ye beast of the field
[1:20:35] for the pastors of the wilderness do
[1:20:37] spring
[1:20:39] for the tree
[1:20:41] bears her fruit
[1:20:43] that's the broad
[1:20:44] tree just like jesus said in matthew 24
[1:20:49] 23
[1:20:51] he said learn a parable
[1:20:53] of the fig tree any bible reader knows
[1:20:56] that the jewish nation is the fig tree
[1:20:59] but not only the fig tree she's the fig
[1:21:02] the olive and the grape that's israel in
[1:21:04] the scripture but not only will that
[1:21:07] tree be restored the broad tree will be
[1:21:09] restored because when naomi went back
[1:21:12] she took ruth with her in the season of
[1:21:16] the barley harvest
[1:21:17] that's right
[1:21:19] he says now
[1:21:22] just be not afraid
[1:21:24] you beast of the field
[1:21:26] for the pastors of the wilderness
[1:21:28] do spring
[1:21:30] for the tree
[1:21:32] for the tree
[1:21:34] beareth her fruit
[1:21:36] the fig tree
[1:21:38] and the vine do yield their strength
[1:21:41] be glad then
[1:21:43] eat children of zion
[1:21:45] and rejoice in the lord your god
[1:21:49] for he has given you the former reign
[1:21:51] moderately
[1:21:54] and he will cause to come down for you
[1:21:57] the form the rain the former
[1:22:00] and the latter rain
[1:22:02] in the same month where is that at
[1:22:04] brother andre and i saw another mighty
[1:22:08] angel descending with an open book
[1:22:10] that's revelation chapter 10. that's
[1:22:12] your scripture
[1:22:14] it says now verse 24
[1:22:17] and the and the floors
[1:22:20] shall be full of wheat
[1:22:23] and the fats
[1:22:24] shall overflow
[1:22:26] with wine
[1:22:27] with wine and oil that's stimulation of
[1:22:31] revelation
[1:22:32] that's right
[1:22:34] that's the harvest of the feast there
[1:22:38] he says now verse 25
[1:22:41] and i will restore to you the years that
[1:22:44] the locust has eaten
[1:22:46] the cankerworm
[1:22:47] and the caterpillar and the palmer worm
[1:22:51] my great army which i sent among you and
[1:22:53] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[1:22:57] and praise the name of the lord your god
[1:23:00] for he had dealt wonderly with you and
[1:23:02] my people
[1:23:04] shall never be ashamed
[1:23:06] and ye shall know
[1:23:08] that i am in the midst of israel
[1:23:10] and that i am the lord your god
[1:23:13] and none else and my people
[1:23:16] shall never
[1:23:18] be ashamed i'm thankful
[1:23:22] that god
[1:23:24] it's not my responsibility
[1:23:28] and as great a minister as brother dale
[1:23:31] is it's not his responsibility
[1:23:34] or brother way
[1:23:36] but it's god's
[1:23:38] responsibility to restore
[1:23:41] that bride tree because he said
[1:23:44] i
[1:23:46] will do this how will he do it
[1:23:49] how is he doing it
[1:23:51] through brother dale
[1:23:54] through brother wade through brother
[1:23:56] gavin through these ministers
[1:23:58] he is doing it through the prophetic and
[1:24:02] the bride
[1:24:03] who is the receiver
[1:24:05] of the prophetic
[1:24:08] she is receiving word
[1:24:10] that's springing up
[1:24:12] and producing
[1:24:14] jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:24:18] today and forever
[1:24:20] a tree that was eaten down to the stomp
[1:24:24] is now bearing for fruit
[1:24:27] the leaves
[1:24:29] are clapping
[1:24:30] and the word of god
[1:24:32] has not returned void
[1:24:35] amen
[1:24:36] god bless you
[1:24:37] let us bow our head
[1:24:39] kind heavenly father

[1:24:43] that you were going to restore
[1:24:45] the broad by the prophetic word lord
[1:24:49] and lord we're thankful
[1:24:51] that as you told peter that day
[1:24:54] who do men say that ah the son of man
[1:24:56] and
[1:24:58] the revelation of these things
[1:25:02] you would build your church
[1:25:05] on the anointed word for the hour
[1:25:08] the christ of the hour
[1:25:11] and lord we see
[1:25:13] your words
[1:25:14] going forth lord
[1:25:17] with life
[1:25:20] inspiration
[1:25:23] breathing
[1:25:24] as in genesis 2
[1:25:27] your scripture says that you breathe
[1:25:30] life into the nostrils of adam
[1:25:33] and your prophet said
[1:25:34] this was nothing human
[1:25:37] this was eternal life
[1:25:39] god's
[1:25:41] own life
[1:25:44] and lord you have breathed upon us in
[1:25:46] this last day
[1:25:48] your breath

[1:26:39] to have eyes to see ears to hear lord
[1:26:42] a place that your word can rest father
[1:26:46] and as your prophet standing there
[1:26:48] between the sixth and seventh seal lord
[1:26:51] calling out abroad
[1:26:53] chopping out abroad by the word
[1:26:56] prophesying saying i saw her the
[1:26:59] vindicated masterpiece i heard a voice
[1:27:01] said do you want to see the bride i said

[1:27:30] pool we see this new dimension lord that
[1:27:33] no one can enter in because no one can
[1:27:36] approach your light lord and as jesus

[1:27:42] father draws him
