========================================

when they're born when they go to school they study war then they go into military for two years so they're all military minded why because they're not like us with 300 something million people we got a big pool to choose from you know the United States they've got probably three and a half million to choose from them to fight the whole world but you know what when NIEM to profits get done and you get over in that last half of that week God's gonna fight for Israel because he said I will not forget them and I will fight for them and then that to give you an expected end then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto thee and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart and I will be found of you it's not kind of what happened to me and you that kind of what happened to us we prayed to God and he found us and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether I have driven you saith the Lord I will bring you again into the place which I caused you to be carried away captive in other words they were going into Babylon for 70 years they were going into Babylon for 70 years from Jeremiah they were going into captivity Daniel was in that captivity during that time right he was in the 68th year of his captivity he knew by books Jeremiah he knew by the Prophet before him William Marion Branham so thank God sent it to send it to us and we look in what books we know by books this is fixing to happen we know by bullets the Bible is fixing to happen then brother Branham gave us clarity he was able to bring the mind of God to you and let God speak to you amen because you know if it's contrary to the word it's not God talking to you I mean we should be well enough adults to know even children adults to know that if you're told to do something contrary to the word it's not God it's the devil pretty simple and then the Bible says resist the devil and he'll flee from you he won't walk away from you he'll flee from you and how do you resist him just thing I love him or only believed to him every once in a while Satan can't stand that he'll just kind of move on out of the way amen when psy calls you be carried away so Daniels in there and he's wanting to know God we got two more years until we get out of here what's gonna happen to me and my people and remember what brother Browns dead brother Brown said God not only told him how many years will be left to him to leave he told him what was gonna happen all the way to the Millennium hey man Cody's fixing in Daniel 9:24 right here well we're gonna read Romans first but in Daniel 9:24 he tells him exactly what's gonna happen the whole Gentile kingdom coming in and all that so let's read Romans 11 we read this last Sunday let's read it again because what's gonna happen I want to show you what this I've got so gracious to blind the eyes of them thou slow down a minute that will say then the branches were broken off that I might be grafted in he's talking about Israel Israel is an olive tree right okay well because of unbelief they were broken off look so this is still the tree like say this is still the tree here's the roots and here's the life going up through the tree and here's our lives all over the olive tree but they because of unbelief there was some branches broke off because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith talking about you and me he's talking to Gentiles be not high-minded but fear don't be high-minded their Lord God thought more me no listen if you want to get down to the brass tank look at what God did to his own children so you could come in he literally blinded his own children so you can have a chance so let's don't crow and say well then poor old dumb is realized they should know God did that you leave it alone God blinded his own children so that you could come in because what how many times did Jesus say I have found no greater faith in Israel when he come to a Gentile walking up right I found no greater faith in Israel what's he saying right here because of the unbelief of you Jews can I interpolate they were broken off and thou standest by faith but don't be high-minded but fear for if God spared not the natural branch in other words here's the natural tree God's the one that pulled those broke those branches off for if God spared not the natural branch take heed lest he also spare not thee because he didn't have to take that wild olive tree and put it down into this one right here he didn't have to do this right here but he did because of you and me he did that because of you sitting here tonight behold therefore the goodness and severity of God on them which fell severity in other words serve you but toward the goodness here if thou continue in his goodness oh the words that also shall be cut off whoa he said well I'm well there be careful and they also hoo watch and they also they the Jews if their body not still in unbelief shall be graffed it in for god is able to graff them in look at me again they still got to go a little bit farther we got a little bit more to go for if thou were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and we're grafted contrary look to nature into a good olive tree we were grafted in right here we were grafted in right here they rolled up and I didn't we're mad for if thou wert cut off the olive tree which is wild by nature and we're grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these which be the natural branch natural Israel be graft into their own olive tree because I'm fixing the region in the Bible the two prophets that go to Israel are called the two olive trees and then for I would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery and it is a mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness is part right here has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in right here rapture right God cannot deal with the Jews in any part of restoration till we're on here and so all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins amen not all rights amen now let's read Daniel so here we are seventy weeks are determined they're going to be in captivity for 70 weeks okay allegory okay parable okay because they were in captivity for 70 years way back several thousand years ago and came out of captivity built the city during all this they said they're gonna do except for the first part right cuz this is already being fulfilled right here right here this has it this hasn't been fulfilled go this is what this is the restoration of Israel all right this will happen in that last week but this right here has already happened we'll look at in just second all right there by okay with that 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and the city in Ezekiel 42 44 there's going to be a millennial city built a literal city but now there was a time when there was a commandment to build Jerusalem back during Cyrus's time which was in Ezra Nehemiah and all those ones back that way right buds that is from the Ezra naman all those right there was an edit went forth to bring people into Jerusalem to rebuild what the wall and the city and the temple alright so you got a look and see this is like brother Dale said this scripture still being written it's not been fulfilled all yet part of a house we're not Oliver house seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to do six things read the six fold purpose that six fold purpose is God purposely bringing Israel back just like we have six seals that brings us back to redemption under the Seventh Seal their seventh seal is Jesus Christ - who does the two witnesses preach to them Jesus Christ amen and who's going to walk in the Millenium and set King no not David the son of David which is Jesus Christ he's going to set and what bring all this into being but he's got to come back that's what I want to get into we got to come back into two prophets down here mm-hmm excuse me seventy weeks are determined upon thy people upon the holy city to do six things finish the transgression justification make an end of sins sanctification because they got to get born again just like you and to make reconciliation for iniquity three things and you know what when those Street things happen to you what does it do to you it brings in everlasting righteousness it sells out the vision and prophecy the word made flesh and anoint the most holy that's this guy right here and I don't mean me I mean your guy whoever you are so see what I mean it's an allegory to us but that's a literal happening to the Jews because what's going to happen is when the two witnesses step on the earth they're going to preach the finishing of the transgression of Israel they're going to make through Jesus Christ being revealed to them they're going to make an end of their sin they're going to make reconciliation for their iniquity they're going to bring in everlasting righteousness seal up division property in north the most holy hallelujah that's exactly what's gonna happen he's already done that to you God's waiting on ice to get out of the way so you do it to them know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem until my side the Prince shall be seven weeks that's right here we already went through this whole thing many many times so you should be okay with this all right all right and threescore is what three times - at 62 we've 62 I mean 62 and 769 to where after three segments the street shall be built again the walls even troubles time now that was done all in here amen and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off when was he cut off at Calvary well they said let his blood be on us and our children the Gentiles had not begun that was your sixty-nine weeks are finished not halves it's not in the Bible seven weeks and threescore and two weeks weeks it'll be built again the walls even troubles times mm-hmm and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself what would you cut off for you in Israel you and Israel thought he's gonna save us and he's gonna save them and the people of the prince that shall come who is that Prince Titus Titus was a Roman general comes in eighty seventy right here and destroys what they built Jesus told him in Matthew 24 don't get caught in that city right because what happened was they got in there and they put a siege around the city and they waited for them to just run out of food and they eat the bark off the trees and then they started eating their children then when they finally got in there they killed every person in the city there shall be with the end shall be with a flood and to the end of war desolations are determined how many wars has Israel had in these two thousand years you can't count them war here war there war here war there the Six Day War was just maybe back in some of y'all's time some of your older ones remember the Six Day War in the 60s one nine nineteen sixties something nine someone sixty-seven okay that was the Six Day War a miracle have you heard Gershon Salomon tell about that because he was the general and during that time remember he was supposed to being killed run over by tank and everything else he said he said I don't remember they were getting ready to assassinate him they had surrounded him he was getting ready to shoot him and said he looked up and they all took off running and they were interviewed later and said well there was whatever whatever what company was coming and he said they wasn't a company nowhere around me God give him a strong delusion that they should believe a lie and be damned by a man same way with me and you Elijah was standing one day with the guys and guys I said we're in trouble why sure he's more for us than they are more for them they aren't from us in other words that's what he said because he was counting all them people and why she just looked over him said that's more for us and the license going there's more for us then or them engage that's going one two one two one two how are we gonna do this he said Lord open my servants eyes and he said there was a chair he said there was chariots of fire all wear around that prophet and Gotha same way with you and I maybe for whatever look in that dimension sometime we'll see him around me and you amen alright so he was cut off let his blood be on us in our children that's where they did their great sin will read that next Sunday where the Prophet talks about it and God quit dealing with them as a nation do you hear me cuz that's important God will deal with an Israel with Israel as an individual because 120 in the upper room were Jews but this is a Gentile dispensation he will not save Israel as a nation until we leave I'll read it to you just a second everybody all right are we following along okay and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself people oppress your that should come he'll draw us destroy the city and the sanctuary because see have you ever thought about this when you look at the the mural that they painted when Titus was leaving Jerusalem now Titus was a Roman general think about this because this is gonna hook to this covenant we're fixing to talk about if Israel knows they've got to have all their little pieces to build their ark to start doing their sacrifices for their red heifer and for all the things they got to do they got to have the Ark of the Covenant they got to have the menorah they got to have all these things if you're looking going your history Google Titus it shows there's a mural painting or an etching in stone them disassembling the Ark disassembling the menorah and you see it on their back and they're leaving of it Israel well where do you think those pieces are now they're in the Vatican they're in the Vatican Israel knows that so there's gonna be a covenant name mm-hmm Titus was a Roman general he didn't take it to the United States when he got finished with it no he took the booty that called booty or the bounty they took it back to Rome they took it to Rome and they didn't put it in a warehouse they took you to the Vatican and said here Pope I get ten thousand virgins now you know still what I mean when I die when I go to heaven I get up no okay but you know what Pope said just put it down there and put it down there in the closet and shut the door and we'll need this later right so for 2,000 years they've had every piece Israel needs and you don't think Israel knows that sure they know that and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week now who is that he because that he breaks the covenant that cannot be Christ that cannot be God that he is the Antichrist now when he makes that coven when the Jews are we here brother Brennan said if you see that covenant made with the Jews you've missed the rapture so look so where do we go we're gone the Covenant is made for one week read that right so there's one week left after the rapture I don't care what any high-minded preacher says the Bible says there's only one week there's one week left after the rapture people just don't get what brother Byrne was talking about and then because it is a mystery and in the midst of the week what's the middle of seven but now remember that's thirty days to a calendar month not 31 we're on the prophetic calendar so it's 1260 days they shall prophesy for 1260 days in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease brother Daniel you know what he's going to do for three and a half years he's gonna let Israel think there let their Messiah coming back so because they're giving he's giving them the ark he's giving them the menorah he's given this he's giving them that but when they get all that built and get it all put together guess what's gonna happen the Pope is gonna walk in that temple and for one he just desecrated it because he's not a Jew he walks in there and he says y'all don't need to be doing this no more I'm God talk about being mad they gonna be ill so that's what he's gonna do he shall cause the sacrifice where do they make sacrifices in the temple and the oblation to cease our offering to cease for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation and that determined shall be poured out upon the desolate everybody got that say man all right so they'll covenant of 1260 day coven I mean a one-week covenant and in the midst of that covenant it will be broke in the midst of the week he shall cause now what's going to happen right here this is what we need to get to tonight what's gonna happen around here when we leave God's going to come and anoint to preach to people with the larger anointing and Moses anointing and send them to the Jews and when I say send them that don't MIT then that can't be Americans they gonna be Jews all right so don't think don't think here don't think me or you were going over there we're gonna be at the marriage supper waiting on all this to happen that all right okay so now let's go to revelations 11 that was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God in the altar and then that worship therein you read that I'll just discuss that just a second ago but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles the Gentiles has always been able to come into the very outer part they just can't go in they just can't go in the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months how much is forty two months three and a half years all right forty-two months count them forty-two months three twelves is 36 and then high that's 42 so there's your three and a half years are you twelve hundred days and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore which is sixty days twelve hundred and sixty days clothed in sackcloth now what do they do they preach Jesus Christ to that Orthodox Jew group over there that's looking for the Messiah to come cuz I'm going to give you a little secret them to profits after twelve hundred and sixty days they're not gonna be killed by the SEAL Team six they're gonna be killed by the Mossad cuz look people America don't care what goes on over there really don't care what goes on over there sure we're protecting Israel because we have an interest and I will get power to my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred threescore days clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees what are we just talking about God's fixing to put them to good branch's back in there these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them and I see that's why this is the tie this will come back to on the sixth seal this is what we'll read because this is the opening of the sixth seal brother branham said the two prophets are that six seal all right whatever they call that's what's going to happen if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemy now that's not going to be they're not gonna be flame throwers kids and adults it's the word whatever they say that's what's gonna happen that's why I'm telling you when you and I when that sixth seal breaks to me and you people that's you speaking to her and nobody can stand before it and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must be in this manner be killed these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy Elijah and have power over waters to turn into blood Moses and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will and when they shall have finished their testimony what how many days do they prophesy 1260 that's 42 months not over here right here and when they shall finish their testimony what is their testimony let me read you their testimony to finish the transgression to make an end of sin and to make reconciliation for iniquity now you can't say bring in everlasting righteousness because they don't Battle of Armageddon happens after that that's why there's got to be three and a half more years left of earthly time not ministry and not tribulation there's only three and a half years of tribulation it starts here and works its way there but right here's gonna be a battle of Armageddon and who knows what's gonna happen over here all heck's gonna break loose you got an atomic explosion it don't kill everybody in one minute you got nuclear fallout you got people dying because they can't get food it may take three years for this planet to completely Dahl hello think but it's gotta end here that 69 plus one makes what 70 and that ends the captivity of Israel so the two prophets preached finishing the transgression and make them into sin make reconciliation for iniquity they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when they shall have finished their testimony in other words when 144,000 men receive the baptism of Holy Ghost 12,000 from this tribe 12 from this 12 from this 12 from 12 tribes mm-hmm when they finish their testimony the Beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them you know what listen to me this will help you Jesus had a three and a half year ministry while he was on this earth on the River Jordan that anointing came down not to make him God please people the Bible said he was born Emmanuel God with us I don't need nobody tell me no never but when he comes to the River Jordan at 30 years old Bible said becoming 30 he received an anointing for a three-and-a-half-year message that he couldn't die during that time because when he came to the Garden of Gethsemane the spirit left him so he could die you see that same spirit when they finished their three and a half year ministry because don't you think that for three and a half years of them calling plagues on this whole world not just Israel they're calling plagues on the whole world don't you think the mossad is gonna want to kill them about the first week they're in business but for three and a half years they got a message by the way just like Jesus said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but when they finish the 144,000 they finished that 1260 day prophecy that anointing is gonna lift off them they're gonna be killed and they're not gonna be killed by Americans or Russians they're gonna be killed by Israelis but you know why because those 144,000 are going to go to those Jews that are trying to put the temple together trying to get the red heifer they're trying to get this they're trying to get this why cuz they think the Messiah's coming 144,000 in the two witnesses are going you missed him two thousand years ago and they're gonna go know we've been two thousand years trying to get this moment here and you're telling us it's worthless and you know what if I was there which I won't be but if I was there I'd walk away about that 1250 ninth day and I'd say we're fixing to leave this place and that man y'all think a lot of called the Pope he's gonna desecrate your temple in about 3:00 in about a hit about another year he's gonna come and desecrate your temple cuz that's what's gonna happen then that's going to make the Jews mad then they're just gonna start pushing buttons we've heard of the Samson effect remember what's the assassin effect Sampson pulled the pillars down and destroyed himself but he too 3000 with him same way with Israel they're gonna start punching buttons well if we're gonna die your or die it's wonderful when you see the pieces of the puzzle fit together it really is you know why because it takes the fear out of all of us that takes fairway from me wondering what's gonna happen hey man and when their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually called Sodom and Egypt we're all Lord was crucified and they have the people the kindred tongue the nation shall sin see their dead bodies CNN Fox News whatever you want to call it three days and a half we go back to that three and a half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in the grave well you know what about three and a half days in that hot Sun guess what's going to happen right and the cameras are gonna be on think about it all the cameras and all the people are going to be going these are the ones that tormented us and now they're dead and they're gonna what rejoice make merry and sin gives it's gonna be a real temporary real temporary okay cuz they didn't put them in the grave in other words they're desecrating them like you wouldn't believe and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth not just Jews or old the whole world and after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet what a revelation that's gonna be to the world I I don't know I wouldn't want to be able to see it but I want to I'd like to see the reporters face when he turns around of looks and him two people are standing up and great fear fell upon them which saw them and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them that's what we're looking at now let's to go to Zechariah 12 we'll be done right here this is the restoration I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourning for his own son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness first firstborn this is when the two prophets are revealing Jesus Christ to the Jews in that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem as the mourning of hide Romanian none in the valley of Megiddo which is the valley of armageddon and the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the house of David apart their wives apart the family of the house and that you know why they're doing this it's being revealed to them that they're the ones that killed the Messiah so they're in fear but all the two prophets you're going to say fear not fear not God did all this to bring a Gentile bride in and now we're bringing you this message in this raising you right Becca now not to not to not to brideship but to be servants and remnant their wives apart the family of the house of Nathan apart and their wives apart the family of the house of Levi apart and their wives apart the family of Shammai apart in their wives apart all the families that remain ever family apart and their wives apart is that grow out thirteen verse one is to continue reading and that day there shall be a fountain open to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and uncleanness and it shall come to pass in that day saith the Lord of Hosts that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land and they shall no more be remembered and also I will cause the prophets than the unclean spirit to pass out of the land Zechariah 13 verse 6 and one shall say unto Him what are these wounds in on hands they preach jesus christ so real to those people here's the question now we know Jesus does not physically come to them that's the same way with you now we need we are we're trying our best to preach Jesus Christ so real so that you see him not over here somewhere in here well that makes you a second person if he's over here then he shall answer those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends awake o sword against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow says the Lord of Hosts smite the Shepherd and the Sheep shall be scattered and I will turn my hand upon the little ones brother branham said that little ones means the Benjamin group because he was the baby of all the children of Israel him Israel Jacob he was the baby and that type to the 144,000 so that's telling you right there I will turn my hand upon the 144,000 and bring them up and bring them where cuz look folks please this millennium is 1,000 years it's not for us so for us it's not ours we have no claim on the millennium we have no claim on son of David we're there as a guest where there is a guest we're there on a honeymoon we've already been married we got a glorified body we don't eat at the wedding supper we don't come back we don't walked into the temple - what to do that last thing of that 6-volt purpose to anoint the most holy where brother adam said that was the bride walking into the temple you and I will be the anointing to that temple in the Millennium right here when that 70 weeks is over their captivity is finished and they're going to finally have that thousand years of rest that'll be there do you believe that they have never ever had that's their rest for what the land and the people you and I are there on a honeymoon we're just there why weren't look folks this is still the sole seventh day that's not eternity you cannot become eternal right here we get our eighth day right here why do we need an eighth day back in a seven that's going backwards but they need a seventh day they need a cleansing they need a walk to a thousand years to where God said you're gonna be my people and I'm gonna be your God David is gonna sit on that throne like you've always wanted and you're gonna come into this temple not to make sacrifices no there won't be physical sacrifices in the Millennium but there'll be a temple there where you can show them justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost let's stand to our feet know that millennium is not to us we get to enjoy it but there's still in that seventh day because remember Satan is down here bound somewhere with all his little demons he's still there lurking in the shadows can't work but now right here at the end before the Battle of Gog and Magog that's a white throne judgment he's gonna pop back up because the eighth day doesn't happen till that new city comes right here ma'am you and I are already in it by the baptism of the Holy go there's a redemption of Israel under the fifth seal we see though that a group of fifth seal Jews fit in there where God blinded their eyes right here and did not deal with them as a nation for 2,000 years but when he comes back here the blindness of Israel will be taken away when we leave and then I didn't read that where's it at oh sorry I was a 66 before she travailed she brought forth before her pain came she was delivered of a man-child who have heard such a thing who had seen such a thing see how the earth be made to bring forth in one day our shall a nation be born at once for as soon as i'm travailed she brought forth her 144,000 hey man musicians come israel be born in a day that will be not the whole nation of israel but there'll be 144,000 will receive the Holy Ghost I'll clean that off later thank you I'm telling you folks this gets gooder and gooder I mean it just gets gooder and gooder if it's don't if this don't stir your soul you where's Aaron your spoon fell out your bowl no he says you spoon done fell out your bowl no that's kind of southern but but next time they will talk about what happens under that fifth seal and that should be all of it
