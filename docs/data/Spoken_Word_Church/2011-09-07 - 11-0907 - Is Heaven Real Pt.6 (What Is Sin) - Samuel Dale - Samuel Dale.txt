to you in Jesus name we're getting about as many on the Internet to be live at things is we're having live in the building so what we're having a good speaking crowd that keeps increasing but that's one way of not having to build on your building and just let them stay our edition anybody wants to listen they can listen to you out there weeks a good evening and pray for us all right revelations we read revelation 1 on down through but I just want to jump the end tonight where we will pick up the part we're trying to bring and will drop down to verse 7 of Revelations 12 and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven noticed neither was their other pets the Angels the the people had fallen there were no place left for in heaven right and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and I am the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accuses them before our God day and night and I told you when we get back to it that we will pick up a little further on this revelations 12 have you noticed it's not just one thing right Satan and was cast out back there all right and then you got all of this time and all of the taking place well then he's going to be cast out of heaven in the last days yep all right that's right no he's not going to be cast out of the territory right the place of heaven because he's done they cast out of it but are you going to be cashed out at heavenly places and you and I'm got a lot to do with that i matter so we got a lot to do when we get to it and try to come to that scripture okay so just hold on to that so that you'll know what I'm talking about okay John 3 and 18 just for one verse he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already won why is he condemned already because he had not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God you may be seated or that his blessing to the reading of the word now we've been talking for some time about heaven and how real it is and how real gaudiest and you know I hope that it's been a help to you to try to understand things I know we all say we believe in a heaven but we're finding out a few things maybe that is a very much of an interest it has been to me anyway to try to speak on it and now we were talking her Sunday that sin did not originate on earth that sin originated in heaven right on because that was the first thing was seeing the angels were created God created the angels and it could have been billions of years and he let him stay iron and they was having a wonderful time but as we'll see then Satan begin to get exalted in you know and that's worth seeing originated so then you know it's not looking at it then I hope it takes away the thought from our mind we say well what is sin people will say smoking drinking around women and then we say we'll program said that's not so that is unbelief well how do we understand that I'm hoping that it will help us to understand it those angels had no way of sinning as we looked at sin are used to believe seeing what we used to believe sin with what we done or didn't do right that was our thoughts because that's what we've been told all of her life all right but then the Prophet I noticed one time in looking at it today that he said that this is going to really caused a great stir you know anyone simply talking about that sin was not smoking and drinking and gambling and stuff like that and he said it would cause a great stir what for people and finally realize that that's not what it is will it see original in heaven and the angel sitting have any ability to drink smoke to run around whatever you want to call it you know then we ought to get that out of her mind and get down to the truth of it of what is sin seeing is to disbelieve God's Word now watch that as we go along tonight and I've got a lot of notes written and jump about so forgive me if I do but I want you to get a point from it that what is sin so whatever happened in the garden remember it was what happened in heaven the sin that was in the garden was the same sin that was in heaven right that's where we think we look at no no no no that was adultery Eve committed adultery that was the attribute or display of her unbelief number around said she doubted Hebrews 13 8 no limit I mean that's simple enough but now if you don't get nothing here's the point draw it across whatever was the sin in heaven would be the same in the garden all right right man now so then whatever would be the sin that was in heaven that would be the same in the garden will be the end times sin because this is alpha and omega that this is the beginning and the ending right all right so whatever it was in heaven is the same thing it is right here tonight and so it wasn't be that things that we do those are the attributes he said you smoke because you don't believe he says you drink because you don't believe he said you run around because you don't believe so that has nothing to do with sin you're not going a serious condemn the Prophet set on a higher level you didn't believe it's not as we said it's condemned already senators condemned on a higher level if not record kept of in life right God doesn't have to keep a record to bring into judgment now if necessary he wants to argue about it sure it'll be fine right but it won't be necessary but run said the center will turn his head and walk away and go to hell and never even look because he'll know that god is just so let's get it out of the way of trying to get these little things and let's get one more thing heavily out of the way you sold see mr. disbelief God now do you believe that those angels didn't believe now the Angels did they not believe that God was real no they knew it was rehabbing he created him right amen so there's no argument that they were not believing in God right all right now so when we come to the garden the prophet of God said if this eve believed ninety-nine percent maybe even he said none for domino's at ninety-nine percent of what God said she didn't say that wouldn't he got right there was no thought whatsoever involved that it wasn't the god now so that your mind leave then we we need to find out then what is the original sin and we'll see that that original sin will come all the way down through the Bible and come down to where we are here today now there cannot be a falling away unless there is a truth to fall from all right so now you see where I'm hated we're not talking about the denomination's when I talking about the center of the world the prostitutes the different things nah we're talking about sin we are the only people that can bring forth sin into the way that it would be the same as was in heaven you agree because it was a time that Martin Luther would would smoke a pipe and drag him here you know he said in a hug you know a liquor joint and talk about the Bible he was a child of God right god never condemn him but yet we come along and we fight will well sure we know what's in this but what happened in heaven that made Satan turn into be a sinner could not be interfaces and he wouldn't say there is no God race that it could not be attributes or displacement things or actions in his life that he was turning out to be a mean guy right no you want to see that after he gets here that's the attributes display once he reaches here alright but now if you don't get nothing else to disbelieve the revealed Word is sin then okay now let's make a 2011 you know version of that all the cooks old people believe that everybody else is in sin yep always have another person people believe everybody else is insane but then all the River Jordan G the Peru sears the the doctrines of the message they believe that everybody else is in sin and they can quote they went out from us cuz it was not Elvis cuz had they been of us they would have remained do you can see where we ended up this scratching the surface surface just a little Sunday and we want to take up right there and it will be on number six brother Joe on the notes and to be paragraph 62 the greatest battle ever fought and look like the prophet of God head and say you somebody a great battle this man great first now that was ever fought begin in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer in his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven now out of all of your theological understanding show me one of them the total debt they will break everything down here as they go to get going because they think it's impossible for sin to have originated in the portion that are the thing that we call heaven right so it did was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fellow human the end of the battle for mangoes become human battles all right now so sin originated in heaven not on earth all right you said well we believe that all right now we'll pick up a little bit in a minute and watch these phrases as they begin to appear that the prophet of God said Satan wanted a denomination huh to Satan in his pride he wanted to build a more beautiful Kingdom yep but better class of people he was very jealous of Michael right hmm you might not even i would understand Michael because he knew he could have all the other angels but he couldn't handle Michael so now watch this as we go along to Satan cannot create you agree so he perverts what God has created okay what's that so just follow along with me number seven paragraph 2 25 the unveiling realities of the Living God 1960 remember SYM didn't begin on earth CN begin in heaven when Lucifer Lucifer taken and made him he said I wanted the nomination make a great big thing went on the north country and set up a bigger thing than Michael had and he was kicked out of heaven now the northern side of heaven was known as the worship team and Satan is the worship angel that's why he loves worship he loves to go to church he loves worship because he's the number one guy of worship that was his job that was his part yeah but he wanted a development a denomination right he wanted something bigger than model now why would he be like that the first off he was not created Lucifer he was created the anointed turabath and he stood beside the Lord we could the minute he stood by his right hand mmm he was not created wrong God cannot create anything wrong so now watch the very simplicity of it and then what as we try to bring it down into the message people because whatever start is not an end now so what would me it was or what did take place now we gave you number 8 paragraph 33 34 of why 1960 03 09 that the prophet of God tells you that there's only one Sam that's unbelief now it's not drinking ailment smoke in C read down through sin is not smoking cigarettes no different things you can read it but watch what he says there's only one sin that's unbelief any man if Helios as Holy and past and as good as he could be and yet say that the days of miracles is past and then I the Scriptures saying Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that man is a sinner because he's an unbeliever now no matter how good a pasar wonderful a person see then so you can see the end that when run around when we get to in a minute work with quote that Eve distally one thing in that was even was 30 nights you can see what he's bringing it to now you go out today anywhere you want to go and you ask anybody denominational people this message people order are you an unbeliever of course not no we're believers I believe everything right around saying then our lives if they don't match to that point of what we're saying what is it I believe everything he says but now and they certain things that I don't want to fool with there are certain things are that we we leave alone because we don't know we're afraid to venture into those things you know what that makes is an unbeliever right an unbeliever I'm not afraid of anything that God told in the Bible that and they brought to us by the prophet of God why would I be afraid of evening our vini buddy coming to me talking to him amen that's right I don't quite know all the answers but you know my statement is it I wouldn't find somebody that does happen so we don't worry about it so what happened I'm trying to pick up the one work and get down to it but we will read it in a minute the brother said Satan cannot create so when he saw Michael be able to create the world than the things he got upset because he thought it was supposed to come through him right mmm you got all tied up in he begin to reason why was not joke why wasn't I the one that could create but he ought to know that there was no angel ever given the ability to create right he can't be done only God can create right so then his problem was not doubting that now let's be Trinitarian for me huh here's God sitting on a throne he goes up every day of worship singing praises in 24 hours seven days a week on this going on ain't no time so that's not his problem his problem didn't come we'll call it with the the head man his problem came was the one that he couldn't understand which was michael brun rinses Michaels crotch so Michael be in Christ was the low-cost the ethnic center etc all of those big words we talked about using the word of God so he wasn't trying to in the way to at that point to be able to conquer God he just didn't like this time am i right yep give it are you thinking he's saying if I'm the right hand man who's this guy see so he's doubting who it is are you listening right Sophie's daddy who it is worse yet he's an unbelief ms like I've always told you if you don't have enough holy ghost inside of you to be able to figure out whether or not brother Dale stretching the truth you better start seeking the Holy though simple man yeah it's okay now road at least don't break yourself into it tonight but you see what started out as a smallest thing which would be just not wanting to understand who this would come on jealousy i push you to the place that you don't want to understand pride will put you into a place that the Bible says pride goes before following so Lucifer he couldn't understand who Michael would and he didn't want to understand he wanted to some way be able to remove him from the office he was in are you listening don't you will make it as simple as we can you might not agree with it that's all right what is sin we've taken out is all of these big things and everybody thanks it if those are attributes of unbeliever you still believe if you go get em son Jesus I saw was that no problem but Satan the said he couldn't understand it I'm the right-hand man but yet there's someone closer to God than I am the only way I can get to my place that I want is to try to remove him now saying cannot create but he could pervert what God creates so there in the beginning as the angels were worshiping God and all of this is unfolding could you not see that heaven was full of the attributes of God love joy peace goodness meekness right whenever would not that being what God could create a ring into means he is framed in the beans what create means same so he couldn't do that so we started perverting it he started to bring himself up into a room that he wanted to take over now if he wanted to take over what do you want to take over what he thought was his rightful position to stand with the Lord it was a dirty vulgar things that you see none of this was in heaven angels can't do those things so Satan would have to take love and perverted to make something vulgar to appear now did he want to do away as I said did he want to do away with God no he just wants to be worshipped his daughter he thinks that if he gets enough people on his side that he can defeat God now they're not a bad dummy it's our to call him at the thing that God created him and he thinks he can in one way someday he'd be able to take over because that's what it starts out in Genesis cuz he tells the eve says you'll be half God knowing good and evil jumps on over in the Isaiah any talks about you know like in the place over or whatever you want to call it their knives they're 14 but then he gets over in 2 Thessalonians it shows himself to be answered on them so there is this trick gives many angels as you could get to believe his life deal i remember the prophet said the same one he's always told what is the lie that Satan has always told it is not going that way so far do you can't see it it is so close to the truth the only a holy ghost filled person can divide between whether it's a lie of Satan or the truth that's why that no man is a match the Bible says for Satan but Christ is so we don't have to worry about it he can take care of it but look as we go along going down that brother joked about number 10 which is the 21 mark of the beast and the seal of God 1961 look what happens we find that he was the first murderer he was the first one to how jealousy and you think it's dead murdered and that he is that's fine you bring it down you down here you one down with it that's all right look what he said and Lucifer got jealous of Michael wrote it right down to earth and transferred it into man Lucifer got jealous of Michael now I gave an illustration the other day to you maybe you didn't believe but I'd like your definition that how could all of this have happened in heaven and God not know doll about what was going right I mean he's God is omniscient omniscient omnipotent eat right how is it that this could have took place I gave you my definition do what you want to bless your earth you realize my Michael stepped over to create Michael became the Christ the protector of st. let you think you tell me how it would so there's some way the great eternal God in his form of Ella himself existing know he has the ability to turn away from seeing sin but he's always got to be something standing that or someone is a better way of saving so we know that in the garden when it came down that in the garden having each sin and God came down and said Adam where art thou and Adam over in the bushes with his church then he was going on brother Brown cities do little denomination he's making notice his words he said they was in the garden had in church with in fig leaves I kept God from destroying Adam and Eve ma'am sealing the presence of God one second is annihilation what kept me from happening in heaven what kept me from happening in the garden so you don't say will it bring them you don't know how long and what I don't care how long it was in the garden if it was two seconds from the time out of and he see him that God stepped on the scene still he would have had to kill them would you see in order to have substitute now the animal had been slain God slew the animal bactrim a Venetian and gave them to Adam and Eve the skins to put on right that's easier to see Toma Toma but what kept you from being destroyed now go there you've got me confused thank God maybe you can do something about it maybe you're praying that's God to reveal it to you because you know you can't argue with what I'm saying so in the garden we've got scripture to go back to the Jesus Christ according to Revelation 13 8 the jesus christ dude is a lamb slain before the foundation of the world God was not looking at what they were doing in the garden right he was looking at the sacrifice that he had already made but you better recover that away on back because you've gotta cover Satan that's what I say about the poor old boy and about me to you then we could be have the audacity to stand in this last days in the presence of the revealed Word and still want to carry our own ideas and thongs yep he said how you making it to claim 1 you know I'm still glad for that at home never I'm still glad they was an atonement made before the world happen it could take care of me and you have it right and that does it now yeah but are you listening should we talk about that he got jealous number 11 e 17 see you of the Antichrist 55 3 over 1 or 3 11 he said was pity look what he says about the guard you talking about the Antichrist and now the closeness that it works together did you know that it asks heaven that the devil was not driving him man in the beginning that Lucifer the son of the morning with given power and the reason that he brought sin into the world listen he was able to take something they telling you the city bro he was able to take something that got it created and pervert it back into an evil thing who started all of this trouble in the beginning then gone back before the foundation the world they were laid when he seen what safe had done in his pride pride maybe pride goes before follow he said brother Dale you're talking about me if you think I'm talking about you then you know you're in see what's on that Prop a friend who won't Batman too late too late to back down on anything if you think I'm talking about you you're exactly what I'm talking about whether it be my children my life my grandkid or anybody else it in here see because Lucifer being God's right hand man he just couldn't understand how anybody else could be how many use his pride in himself for what the job he thought he was chosen to do and it was chosen for a wonderful job he was given gifts and all sigh all kind of things regrets that he has that supernatural gifts all the time you arguing him about it I only thought God could give out yet so that's the way I used to think it through a prophet said so now I say Satan could pass up supernatural gifts will grow there like that gives that me I'd say look what happened in my life i've done this i seen that i've been here i've done that i preached i'll cast out devils i raised the day pride pride Satan in his pride he became very jealous number 12 her drive 190 questions of entry he broods 157 929 the right-hand man of Almighty God with Lucifer son of the morning the first God granted him almost co-workers with him he was a co-worker partly equal with him only Satan cannot create god is he only create order but Satan took something that God created it perverted back into something else evil and I noticed when Cain and Abel a beautiful picture he was this prefiguring Judas and Jesus it was coming home coworker yep I hope you get the picture how would you like to me vice president of the company what now I'm just coming president vice president we're not going to CEOs and suck all goals and ours and all his other junk now we're just plain old talking of the president of the company in the vice pres did the company well you got a vice president of the company and he thinks he's second in command but then all for the street one day the president brings in some my house yep I wouldn't be too good of a situation would why me make all the decisions when I'm I'm not gonna get no glory right you'd become jealous right you say well why me bring that other guy in I thought I was in charge good good case fit me right you know what would happen and you know good times will come I'm not today becoming to be hard to quit a job today goes of the economy but you know what would happen in ninety percent of the cases my kid the vice president would quit if he found out he had no charge whatsoever to do and couldn't handle things like he thought he spoke to him like he said well they don't need me Ben your money was quick because that would be his pride his most is jealousy all right look at the next number 14 progress 75 questions and answer 59 628 what happened to Lucifer we got we got 23 back of the night just working and training okay yeah brother Anderson's a week we got him going tonight thank God for these people I don't you fella they're worried about me you can exalted cuz I can't do that all right I may be President but i shorten depend on device and all the others down underneath okay listen now I've got just got the bait seen up to this that Lucifer in heaven tried 2x all this thick and even be a little bit higher than his boss okay and he betrayed Michael and made himself a great Kingdom in the north come down now he and his angels were cast out and as he said the person has to the thing you know he sets the kingdom going down he talks about how how Satan control whatever nation there is in the world United States ever kingdom everything is controlled by saying a man to his British morning but yet he didn't like his balls right now like the way Brett around brains it see he didn't like Michael you're reading it brother Brad said that Jesus never argued with Satan when he offered him ever kingdom of the world now I don't to ring back about one-half of a message to go that when Satan would finally the world had already been created but it was in darkness and chaos we haven't got to the world yet it was in darkness and chaos and Satan was cast out and this is his domain that belongs to him don't worry about it things will be made right we lift an excellent number 15 let your light shine before me in 60 1903 you wanted a better class of people got kicked out of heaven because you wanted a better class of people now what's wrong with a better class of people right what's wrong with a better class of people what happened back there at the times when Constantine at them and all the things was happening what happened that the Prophet said he said they began to say now listen they will slow down here and won't we won't this worship God so much and with this kind of control things you know we dress a little different we can better get a better class of people do we get to mayor you know we get many people they never all big people if they're born again no problems with doctors lawyers or are they are if they're born again I guess this one's always just been a problem around here we sit here in an old building that is comfortable enough for us and God will it's enough from all we need but we could have had a build it causes me constant millions of dollars had I taken the money and put it to that use instead of giving it to to you and giving it to the missionaries he sure looks like we don't want no better class now i'm not against a better class i hope you understand I mean it's um dr. Lal you're here is he under be better understand what I'm dumb bout I want to hold the goats feel longer we need them I want a holy ghost filled doctor I mean I just don't want nobody whether he's an idiot or an educated idiot to come in to try to tell us a better way to serve God it's just that way I'm sorry maybe I'm arrogant and hateful but I'm the boss man so we either do it this away or you go some out and i'm not against anybody so well no problems but look he wanted a better class of people you wanted to exalt himself go down to the neck which is Christ the mystery of God reveal paragraph I guess 543 said he wanted to separate fellowship yeah Lucifer and the last days is doing as he did at first hey why did listen renew the first thing that loose were done to separate the fellowship oh god man he wanted to build him a united kingdom a greater splendor and seemingly more cultured a greater kingdom and Michael Christ head hmm Lucifer at the beginning his purpose in heart was to achieve a brighter and greater thing in heaven then cross that is that right by seemingly a more cultured more beautiful more slender new kingdom of Christ I like the rest of you think with our Lord will be able two things at the Millennium another haul it away it's not any part of this but you want to separate fellowship call right back up there in the realms of heaven and what Satan be ended it separate a fellowship yeah Kate oh with everybody that's one thing you can't say about this man are you oh you won't do it I'll shake your hand never service unless you run off and I have to pull away from people that want to talk to me because they'll come by and want to talk about the word and I have to put away you know why because i'm not going to separate fellowship will talk about the word you call me we talk about any time but i'm going to fellowship with the people but how many of you is shaking hands with people in this building little group little things pulling separating fellowship just little things you say would that see him well I thought that's what we were reading the prostate was talking about that I'm not the theologian yeah we brother they live I won't talk with me why I'm first sure to take a bath that way you'll know for a certainty that they don't have that against you trying to get you the life get you away from the Sun business you know what I'm saying right the Bible says and I remember winning sister Margaret died in order to open that scripture to me it says to have friends you must be friendly money for everybody right well then you got to be friendly how many somebody come by shaking him look at you move on i'm cathy from the hail storm or something you man is on the fellowship with that don't tell me you can come up in line we go eat ever once your father certain people how to know sunny afternoon but we've offered every one of you an opportunity to have it in your home cook for 50 people you don't have if there was 50 people coming TN family's company they don't have to do that every tenth week come on what did you dine people no separate to fellowship now let me cover something while I'm thinking man don't you think that God dwells in beauty that's right you see here is where the difference is beauties of God can be a rolling he'll of grace that he could sit down in and look all around him and be happy God's in beauty right why does it emphasized then that Satan you don't a checkup is in BP yep my brother tell me guys both were no range eggs both were no watches cause the Bible said Satan is in the stones I said I agree with you I don't my wife for him by the church looking like a dime store I don't think it's right that you got a ring your husband get it to you probably said way cool pen across from wood where i watch heading down the pocket like remote them about that time he would make it fun the guy which said he said it everybody present he won't know what times would but you couldn't prove watching have geniuses everybody praise Lord a prayer don't even do watch out I'm not throwing on from those people because it was her day I really have a snake around my neck and having that time around I agree we cut a lot of it let's hide restrict what you see we get into some little something and ask that brother s my brother would you answer me one question who say Satan is in Beauty and all of the stones i said would you mind describing that future home over the book of Revelation I said it described all those beautiful diamonds in Rose sapphire I only know what L harbor royalty they were like I don't know nothing about it go into a stored so i could sell me a chuckle wouldn't say that I'm i take it on a Watson look at the diamond I vote for you cuz I don't know nothing about you see is what we think God is in beauty God loves a beautiful place he came down when they improved it when they got one ready for my man you think about all the stuff that was in the night and how a lot of that stuff was overlaid with cold all of those diamonds and pearls and rubies and things he cannot down the so what does it mean that Satan wants to be beauty when we realized God is beauty what you see Satan can't sit down and just be happy is the prophet of God would say what you ask people say what do you want in heaven I want this beautiful I hit mention i want this list out of it he said just build me a little cabin that in the corner of glory lane team in what he said didn't he proved it cuz he could have been a millionaire easily he rejected it spin it for the people proven what he was but you see those people are not taught anymore oath because you think the government thought anymore over man that was that honest no they don't ever trick in the book to try to hang him with three hundred and seven thousand dollars of debt that he had nothing to do with he would just sign his name and he didn't know never put in a bank they said when you sign it it was yours he wound up having to pay accountant taxes and and all kind of things all his 40-some thousand dollars man is making 100 hours a week she see Satan wants everything beautiful look around this message the brothers had came out when I came out and look at your church using their time never brother day I don't know they gotta have four or five hundred seats and I made me no problem to the show building being old church and put a pageant seasoning and it wouldn't be a big old mansion of the time but no then we're gonna do that now that's their business I'm just telling you Gobert on my season you said to see him to do that you want to go further you think it's a sin it takes God's money I do whether you do it hon where these creatures doing up I think it's a sin for me to sit in a big old fancy of Hajj and my people living in shacks and me murdered them to death for their money want to live the double-wide trailer but you want to come see it no one like one cause it's been changed over it got a conversion and doesn't look like it and I'm happy I have a habit yet you say would that be seen I would it not be jealousy pride Satan cast out I like this one number 18 I like to win with a round top you said well around was a nice guy he is I like this one let's just read the first battle that was ever fought was not fall to earth on the earth it was fought in heaven Michael Michael and his angels against Lucifer and they were kicked out of heaven and that great army of the devil and all his what is it young he may got a definition of an amp but that's what we said they were never glad you make a mad you follow me up when I'm not make the mad you tell me what if he isn't any human wouldn't be making a mad you understand what I'm getting that what is seen what is seeing run around to turn your back on the truth and these will be put up on the screen macys divine Haven 54 620 in the church what is seeing I believe he that will turn his back on truth when it's presented to him now listen there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin now muchly personal run today we just don't know where to believe we wait wait wait wait we believe what you read to us do we don't know whether you're right ok what does the word say it's all I've ever asked anybody anybody ever leaves you're asking one question we're off the word well I would stay tell you but your throat out hey we wouldn't believe it anyway you probably run but you could give me a challenge did you ever read it he they disbelieves willfully after Cruz has been presented to him because his church believes different that's when you crossed the line he that sims willfully after he has received the knowledge of the truth I remaineth no more sacrifice brother I just can't understand you some messages are okay but you just Saudi your soul is it what brother branham say now I don't like the cool blood random with everything you know what when I get back yeah yeah now you were no better than that you know the reason I don't like to call it everything he says because if you call it everything he says you're in trouble and I don't do it a lot of times to you like I say about with Nash people that left here show me where them off the word I don't like them at this quote rather adam says you are wrong if you leave a church unless they're off the word this is you're wrong nice antigen wife 19 Nancy naked yeah if the truth comes to you in such a way that you have a knowledge of it and then refuse to receive it now remains no more sacrifice for sin you remember the Lord Jesus the random said one of the school script the scripture said he said if I hadn't come and spoke to you now paraphrasing the scripture Sofia my watch he said if I hadn't come and spoke to prove to you he said you had a covering that's creepy national brilliantly her go start fooling anyone would you find it she come home what you see that makes its in to the little woman caught in adultery he said go and sin no more or less a work shirt fine come upon you but a random in saying it in a message he said I listen to it he said for you to stand here tonight and see God come down and heal the sick and deliver the people and all of the things and he said for you to walk away there is no more sacrifice for you you will get he said for you to see the word in action and you to walk away he said there's no more sacrifice hmm sin is initial form is to reject the revealed Word of God our will of God when God has revealed something as he will and to reject that is to bless thing or to reject God for a serious very serious blessed God I don't have to listen to you I'm greedy but you're guilty of what you've heard yep what do you can do that what you heard I just go somewhere that let me quote you and some of these its layout let me quote them brother dale has nowhere else to go you say you're going awful brother so it soaks onto itself no sir cut it all out of her body right and I want everybody saved because I've been preached to you the message because there is no sacrifice for Seattle only the life of Jesus Christ coming in you there is no animal number is no good deeds no thoughts whatever only Jesus Christ coming and living in you is a sacrifice for sin right that's why I said he descends will flash receiving the knowledge of the truth but arrested you will even willfully sin but arouse said only Christians have sins now where we're going to do with that but against a holy ghost feel Christian no he did when I believe brother Ram was a holy ghost filled Christian run around to you soon he said every day now what's he talking about we've annihilated the situation or should from the fact that we're looking at a man like rudder random that didn't go out and get caught up into the world adult reason all of these things a man who said he live so close to God and do it forced to gift even work I don't claim to be that way I never hang out but I claim a lot of repentance okay cuz see I've been preached to you know the message man he did send will actually receive the knowledge is true there remains no more sacrifice there's not any more sacrifice for that you got a repeat of Christian a Christian a born-again Christian if they don't repent their sins who have to give it a council work not at the white throne judgment no but a judgment of the deed done in the body whether good or bad we have will be judged accordingly not to society eternal life I've been preached on that tree but to turn that in the word seeing as an initial form is to reject the revealed Word of God saying anything this enticement to leave that God said that but he didn't mean it see he wat worst the word breezy the one watch the word you come in my office and sit down and you talk to me and you tell me your problems and think I'll make it your honest to judgment as I can but I've never told anybody that you all right not there you go within what's done I'm taking all right i'll take you go repent well because you retain that's the covering for right that's the company what is seen in unbelief no matter how polished you are if you try to put place the days of miracles in the pious and there's no such a thing and explain it away there's only one word for you brother you're an unbeliever original sin is only what's the original scene in the end time people we don't know who believe that was what they were say it when I came in this message he says we don't know who believe I said what I thought you supposed to believe the prophet yeah well we got hot Sun I can follow we don't know who to follow I said I thought wish to follow the prophets message you don't have to change sits in what is sin Santa John belief unbelief in what the word I'm belief in God which is the word see a man how care who he is a dumb donkey tell you the truth you better believe there is no justification in the line of thinking what I don't have to do this or have to do that because you're a man and I'm a man that's what brought around said he said it's hard to get one man to believe another I'll come here to you many many times and told you that God reveals something to me and I invite you to come and tell me if it's wrong how many pastors would do that I invite you to come and show me where Trump no one cuz I'm will be right the original sin in heaven with when Satan got to the point that he believed he was a greater more powerful force more beautiful and all things greater than Michael he was cashed out in the end time I'll preach on this later when they get back in the end time according to what we've been reading the revelations 12 Michael and Lucifer will meet again in the Battle of Armageddon they'll be idiot then that ties together the Jews because that is Armageddon will be where the Jews are in but when Brett around got on the fourth seal I'd invite you to go read the message he preached the Battle of Armageddon and he never fired a shot he never said Russia was coming down China was coming down this was coming down that was coming down no fighting go read it show me he said it's Protestants and Catholics meeting again and listen if you and I can't win this battle over sin find out what it is and win the battle you might worry about whether there's an Armageddon to the Jews or not but you know I've done read the book I didn't know the story somebody is going to take God's Word and believe it in the face of all doubts and skepticism the hints hints preachers around the message somebody's going to stand on the word and walk off the earth I tried and it won't be beautiful but to God you'd be the most beautiful thing that could ever be you know what's real God more than anything you know what Brett around said one day he said if I was God and they wouldn't take my word he said I'd tell him to forget it but said he's not that away said he keeps coming down to help us and Michael is still refining for us Michael which is Christ the only way we could be the word that is not unbelief is to get got on the inside of us we're a very product of unbelief body spirit soul everything when we must be born again so you must believe this message oh brother Davis all right but if you have what you talked about when he got back at you do you're not a doctor because if marco was who he and God was who he was why did Michael have to take care of the situation you see when that comes out on black why didn't Michael destroy it Lucifer the first entity because his father had already told him the plan of salvation right Michael knew the plan of salvation and he knew that Lucifer had to go through these things and they need have to face him and cast him out and he dr. facing here you have to face him in the end time inside of you and I he knew that so how do you know that he knew the plan of salvation was because I was backed up with him according to joel you know according to joe the other week the message you know I was back never in him and I heard the plan of salvation and I knew my father would have to turn his back to allow sin to appear and it would have to keep that back tournament until you and I become one with the atonement come on Jesus I cone these things what is sin to not believe God's Word you want to work the works of God you know what the Bible says the Bible says to work the works of God is to do what leave on them that God has sent you might not like me in my ways and that's all right I'm sorry I wouldn't be Who I am if I was who you are but what is the word say you mean brother Dale at little Georgia is full of seeing yes cuz why he's not got enough function to be able to come to church all the time thank God we got the internet you said well it's because I'm sick my wife said back there crying in the back pain does your ever service I said here preach to you 102 degree temperature but you need item that notion to get up and come to church now 30 years ago 20 years ago you would have

let's just ask you to help us take away our unbelief we said well we just don't have this we don't have that that's unbelieving I'm stuff to have this is when we get to the point that we doubt what you said we have that's unbelief it's not a movie for me to say I don't have anything it's unbelief for me to come to the point of where that you told me I have it that's why stress many times Lord
