[0:00] [Music]
[0:05] and say to you again good morning good
[0:08] morning I think we're live so like I
[0:10] said we're going to do something a
[0:11] little different this morning um this is
[0:14] the program that I use to keep my notes
[0:16] in so I want to just kind of go through
[0:18] the book of Ephesians starting at
[0:20] chapter one of course we're not we're
[0:21] not going to have time to get through
[0:22] the whole thing but kind of go through
[0:24] maybe the first chapter with the thought
[0:26] in mind being full Redemption CU I I you
[0:30] know you sometimes you it seems like and
[0:33] maybe this is a little bit critical
[0:34] attitude I don't want to be critical but
[0:36] it seems like many times people in the
[0:38] message don't fully understand well the
[0:41] book of Ephesians they don't fully
[0:43] understand full Redemption what's taking
[0:46] place that they look at it as as U we
[0:48] believe the message and we're we we're
[0:50] going to get born again and and then
[0:53] beyond that um if you say anything then
[0:57] you you have a this is going to sound
[1:00] critical but I I it's almost it's the
[1:02] truth and you know how I preach
[1:03] sometimes I just I just lay it out there
[1:05] and right and uh you can't it's almost
[1:08] like you can't be critical you can't say
[1:10] what you really believe yeah or else uh
[1:13] you have a big head and and so forth and
[1:15] everything but you know brother Brandon
[1:17] I was reading where he was he was
[1:19] breaking down the book of Ephesians to
[1:21] this little group of people that he was
[1:22] ministering to and he said this this
[1:24] book is special because you can't preach
[1:26] it you can't talk about it to people
[1:28] that aren't born again it's not for
[1:30] people out there that that are and it's
[1:32] not for new Christians not for somebody
[1:34] that's just now found out about the
[1:36] gospel and just barely coming in and
[1:38] just now hearing about uh being baptized
[1:41] and different things like that it's it's
[1:43] for somebody that's getting rooted in
[1:45] the word and is born again and is ready
[1:48] to begin
[1:49] growing I'm get myself in the frame
[1:52] here so the the book of Ephesians is
[1:55] special right and and I I I I wish that
[1:59] that people all around the message was
[2:00] really spend the the amount of time
[2:03] studying the Bible to compare back with
[2:06] what brother brand actually said to
[2:08] compare to join them up so that they get
[2:10] the real essence of what the message is
[2:12] talking about and and read what the book
[2:15] of Ephesians says and and maybe this
[2:17] would be kind of a bold statement but
[2:19] almost the book of Ephesians is kind of
[2:21] a proof to you that you are born again
[2:24] because when you can read the book of
[2:25] Ephesians and it's coming alive to you
[2:28] and you can understand the things that
[2:29] it talks about adoption and how uh how
[2:33] that you have to grow and how that
[2:34] you're when you're a baby born in Christ
[2:36] that you're not in you God can't have
[2:39] full confidence in you that you're going
[2:40] to do the right thing and and the things
[2:42] that he wrote about uh kind of looking
[2:45] forward to the son of man that God will
[2:47] be revealed in flesh and what he's doing
[2:48] he's building a body and and all those
[2:50] different things and then and then the
[2:52] last chapter talking about how that the
[2:54] the a man and his wife types Christ in
[2:56] the church and and and you know even so
[2:59] many many people look at that as kind of
[3:01] like a a man is greater than a woman but
[3:03] if you really have a real true
[3:05] understanding of what that's speaking of
[3:06] that that out of uh Adam's side came his
[3:09] bride and out of Christ's side came his
[3:12] bride and the bride is supposed to be
[3:13] join airs with Christ and and it comes
[3:16] even that God is unfolding himself into
[3:19] a greater revelation of himself it's not
[3:21] that the man is beating up the wife or
[3:23] anything when to get a real true picture
[3:25] of that maybe read the song with Solomon
[3:27] and you'll get a real true picture of
[3:29] what what God is really trying to speak
[3:31] to us about about how he thinks of us
[3:34] and what his his mind is toward his
[3:37] bride
[3:40] so make sure I got the chapter right I'm
[3:42] going to start off with um where the
[3:46] Ephesians Church started and brother
[3:48] brand he always referenced this a lot of
[3:50] times about how many people were in the
[3:51] Ephesian church and but you can take it
[3:53] back to the Bible and prove the things
[3:55] that he
[3:56] said and so maybe I I throw this out
[3:59] there too as is that um I I I I almost
[4:02] would rather somebody question what I
[4:05] believe and go back and prove it by the
[4:09] Bible like you know how brother R said
[4:11] whenever an angel came and told him told
[4:13] him or showed him scripture he'd go back
[4:15] and prove it and of course that angel
[4:17] wouldn't be upset ministers aren't upset
[4:20] if you if you maybe question what
[4:22] they're going to what they're saying
[4:24] enough to go back or care about what
[4:26] they're saying enough to go back and
[4:28] prove it by the Bible
[4:30] and uh you know brother Dale's going to
[4:33] have I believe he's going to have
[4:34] another questions an answer this morning
[4:36] maybe so if he does and anything
[4:38] anything comes in your mind that you
[4:39] hear this morning that maybe has a
[4:41] question feel free to it ain't going to
[4:43] hurt my feelings if you if you uh pop up
[4:45] with a question or whatever cuz
[4:47] questions are for the edifying of the
[4:48] church right and we're all supposed to
[4:50] be working together to build up the body
[4:53] of Christ so that we can go into Rapture
[4:56] so a minister can't read your mind right
[4:59] but they don't know what you're thinking
[5:01] but you tell them exactly and I I I
[5:04] think that's one of one of my little
[5:06] stressors is you know you preach a
[5:07] sermon and then people kind of gather
[5:08] around and they and they won't tell you
[5:10] you can tell they don't quite agree with
[5:13] you and they'll say well I can tell
[5:15] you've been study or something like that
[5:17] but but but something something's still
[5:20] off though just just tell or if you want
[5:22] tell me then uh and I'm not speaking to
[5:24] anybody here or anything I'm just I'm
[5:26] just kind of throwing this out but tell
[5:28] tell brother Dale or or to ask somebody
[5:30] if if something don't seem right
[5:33] somebody in Authority exactly right
[5:36] exactly thank you
[5:38] sister you like like when the disciples
[5:41] were sitting around and and and Jesus
[5:43] said who do you say that I the son of
[5:45] man am because if you can find somebody
[5:46] that answer that question right somebody
[5:48] that knows what they're talking about
[5:49] you're eyes sister you don't want to
[5:50] just ask somebody anybody but you want
[5:53] to find somebody that really knows what
[5:54] they're talking about like our pastor
[5:57] yes but uh you know lot you say well I
[6:01] don't agree with you well if you don't
[6:03] agree with somebody you should be able
[6:05] to show them in the Bible and the mess
[6:08] where they're wrong don't that I don't
[6:10] agree with you you're wrong because that
[6:13] don't mean nothing because all of our
[6:15] conversation is based upon the word it's
[6:17] not based upon feelings or emotions I
[6:19] feel like you're you're saying something
[6:20] right I I have it it hurt my feelings
[6:23] well all those things are great but our
[6:25] our our whole conversation our whole
[6:27] Christian experience is based upon the
[6:29] word of God
[6:30] so you should be able absolutely right
[6:32] you should be able to say well this this
[6:34] this scripture right here says this and
[6:36] it seems to contradict what you say or
[6:39] brother brand said this over here and it
[6:40] seems to contradict what you say and
[6:42] then you have some some kind of basis uh
[6:45] that you can you can have a conversation
[6:47] about so that kind of took a little
[6:49] detour but that's all
[6:51] right so Acts
[6:53] 19 is where the Ephesians Church started
[6:56] and it came to pass that while Apollo
[6:58] was a COR
[7:00] Paul having passed through the upper
[7:02] Coast came to Ephesus and finding
[7:04] certain disciples he said unto them have
[7:06] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[7:11] believed and this is one of the themes
[7:13] through brother Brown's Ministry now we
[7:14] say we say you reive the Holy Ghost many
[7:17] many people you know will say you reive
[7:18] the Holy Ghost when you believe but now
[7:21] let me explain that I I think it's
[7:23] sometimes it's helpful to kind of uh
[7:25] reiterate things go through things over
[7:28] and over and over again because that's
[7:29] how how we grow and many of you might
[7:31] have heard all these things over and
[7:32] over again but it helps to kind of
[7:34] solidify come on in
[7:36] bro have you received the Holy Ghost
[7:38] since you believe just like just like
[7:40] when a man and a woman gets together
[7:42] something germinates something the
[7:44] process begins to started but I ain't no
[7:46] baby yet have you received the Holy
[7:48] Ghost since you believe you can say I
[7:49] believe that something gets started that
[7:52] process gets started and then that that
[7:54] sell those CES begin to start dividing
[7:56] and after a while you got that little
[7:58] that little embil with with the kicking
[8:00] member the kicking limbs like brother BR
[8:02] said uh it it's it's still not alive yet
[8:05] the life hasn't come into that into that
[8:07] child and just like a Believer start
[8:09] they might be hopping around and and
[8:11] yelling in church and things but yet the
[8:13] the child hasn't come forth and that's
[8:16] what we're looking for have you received
[8:17] the Holy Ghost since you believe but
[8:20] then one day that baby comes forth and
[8:22] there you can hold it in your arms and
[8:24] you can rock it and the spirit of that
[8:26] child like brother R said You' be in the
[8:28] hospital room you can feel that presence
[8:29] of the life come into that child and and
[8:32] then that baby is born so he asked him
[8:34] this question have you received the Holy
[8:36] Ghost since you believed and they said
[8:37] un him we have not so much as heard
[8:38] whether there be any Holy Ghost now how
[8:41] can you receive the holy ghost or how
[8:42] can you make any move toward God at all
[8:44] without hearing the word because Romans
[8:45] 10:14 says how can they how can they
[8:48] call upon him on whom they have not
[8:49] heard how can you how can you move
[8:51] anywhere that's why you got to hear the
[8:53] word you got to read the Bible you got
[8:54] to uh if first you got to come to the
[8:57] word you can't um can't do do anything
[9:00] can't make any movement toward god
[9:02] without hearing the word first and
[9:03] that's why reading the word is so
[9:04] important I keep stressing this to my
[9:06] kids all the time you you say you want
[9:08] the Holy Ghost and everything but you
[9:10] read your Bible you know you let all the
[9:12] and adults and everybody let things of
[9:14] this world get in the way of our reading
[9:17] the Bible and how can you how can you
[9:18] grow the stature of perfect man if you
[9:20] won't spend time with God how can you
[9:23] make any movement toward God toward
[9:25] adoption or anything any of the
[9:27] blessings in God if you want to spend
[9:28] time with it
[9:30] and he said unto them unto what then
[9:32] were you baptized and they said unto
[9:34] John's baptism then said Paul John
[9:37] verely baptized with the baptism of
[9:39] repentance saying unto the people that
[9:41] they should believe on him what should
[9:42] come after him that is on Christ Jesus
[9:45] when they heard this they were baptized
[9:48] in the name of the Lord
[9:51] Jesus after they heard the word then
[9:53] they change direction right cuz now they
[9:55] can go in the right direction once the
[9:57] word's preached and when Paul had la La
[9:59] his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came
[10:01] on them and they spake with tongues and
[10:03] prophesied and all the men were about 12
[10:06] and that's scripture right there the
[10:07] seven scriptures where uh the verse
[10:09] seven is where brother R he always
[10:11] mentioned about how the Ephesian church
[10:13] only had 12 people and it says all the
[10:16] men were about 12 maybe there were some
[10:18] little babies and some mothers went in
[10:19] there as well but that the Bible says
[10:21] that there were the the men were about
[10:22] 12 so that's a small little church and
[10:25] there that small little church uh in
[10:28] this little little set aside place was a
[10:31] group of people where God that they had
[10:34] matured to the point where where Paul
[10:36] could come and teach them the things
[10:38] that were were not just for little
[10:40] babies tossed about wondering if this
[10:42] church was right for them or this church
[10:44] based on their feelings and their
[10:45] emotions and all the different things
[10:47] like that but they were ready to grow up
[10:49] into adoption grow of course back then
[10:51] the Capstone had not come because uh all
[10:54] those things you know waiting for this
[10:56] day for for the for the body to be
[10:58] completed for the church to be finished
[11:00] so that all of us together could be
[11:02] could be represented together and go up
[11:04] to you know why the Capstone didn't come
[11:06] cuz he's waiting for you and I he it
[11:09] couldn't come yet because he's he's
[11:11] waiting for you and I to be born to
[11:12] believe the message to believe the
[11:14] gospel and all these things were things
[11:15] that talked about Paul talked about in
[11:17] in in the book of
[11:19] Ephesians
[11:22] predestination all of the these things
[11:24] are things that he he spoke of in in
[11:26] that book so now let's go on over to
[11:28] Ephesians
[11:32] and look at this and so I said earlier I
[11:35] got uh sometimes just the way the King
[11:38] James version words things it's a it
[11:40] makes it a little bit hard to read us
[11:42] but you know the more and more you read
[11:43] the King James version the more and more
[11:44] you realize it it how could it even be
[11:46] worded any other way and to word it a
[11:48] different way it just changes the way
[11:51] that it is put together in your mind and
[11:52] everything so uh just to as a help I I
[11:55] put the NL the New Living Translation up
[11:57] there and I'm not at all recommending in
[11:59] that and and uh sometimes just the
[12:02] wording they move things around a little
[12:04] bit it helps to understand it uh
[12:06] sometimes I use the Young Living
[12:08] Translation just kind of side by side
[12:09] but I always go back to the King James
[12:11] version except when when brother random
[12:13] said there's a few places where he said
[12:15] that they didn't translate exactly right
[12:17] so I just wanted to point that out just
[12:19] because I have that up there doesn't
[12:20] mean that I'm advocating that you use
[12:21] that at all or anything so um Paul an
[12:25] apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of
[12:27] God to the Saints which are at e
[12:29] and to the faithful in Christ Jesus and
[12:32] so one thing I want to point out about
[12:33] this little church in Ephesus that is
[12:35] that these the the churches that in in
[12:37] Revelation the
[12:39] churches the church ages there was
[12:41] actually physical churches in Asia the
[12:44] Church of the Ephesians and I I think
[12:47] that sometimes that escapes people's
[12:49] mind that they they get it so much in
[12:51] their head that there's these Church
[12:52] ages the Ephesian Church age that they
[12:54] forget that there was an actual Church
[12:56] in Asia that there was actually a beran
[12:59] Church where they wrote letters to and
[13:01] they win and they and they had the same
[13:04] characteristics of the church ages so in
[13:06] this little Ephesian Church age or
[13:08] church it had the same characteristics
[13:11] that were mentioned in the about the
[13:12] Ephesian Church age this the
[13:14] characteristics they that they
[13:16] demonstrated and so Paul's writing this
[13:18] letter to the Ephesians and to the
[13:20] faithful in Christ Jesus so as I as I
[13:23] mentioned before that that this little
[13:25] letter to the Ephesians is not just to
[13:27] to to any anybody out on the street or
[13:30] any new Christians is to the people that
[13:33] are born again and ready to begin the
[13:35] process of growing on up and that's why
[13:37] you can't understand this without a
[13:38] booring an experience you can't really
[13:40] understand this without the teach to
[13:41] open up to you and to real real you and
[13:44] and seems like so many people don't are
[13:46] not fully grasping this that's it it it
[13:49] g it truly Grieves your heart to to
[13:51] speak to people and and they don't see
[13:55] what God is doing in this age and and
[13:58] you've got to see what God is doing in
[14:00] your life because that is what the seals
[14:02] reveal seals reveal Jesus Christ and if
[14:05] you are part of Christ then they reveal
[14:07] what God is doing in your life and you
[14:09] can see yourself in the word that's how
[14:11] John saw himself in the book and you see
[14:13] yourself in the book because the book is
[14:14] open to you and you can look into the
[14:17] book because you can see the Redemption
[14:19] the story of redemption in your own life
[14:22] and you can see what's go what God is
[14:24] doing to you you can see how God brought
[14:26] you through justification and
[14:28] sanctification and B
[14:29] the Holy Ghost and and how the word is
[14:31] being fulfilled in you and how he he is
[14:33] manifesting your himself in your members
[14:36] and in the members of the other people
[14:37] in your church and around you and your
[14:39] family and how the the gospel is being
[14:42] fulfilled in his
[14:45] bride so so let's keep going Grace be to
[14:48] you and peace from God our Father and
[14:50] the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the
[14:53] Lord and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[14:54] who ha blessed us with all spiritual
[14:56] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[14:59] now sinner it cannot be in Heavenly
[15:01] places the only way you can be in
[15:02] Heavenly places is by one Spirit by one
[15:05] baptism by one faith and then you can be
[15:08] in Heavenly places what are these
[15:09] Heavenly places that we're talking about
[15:11] when you get along with God and you
[15:12] start shouting in glory and God begins
[15:14] to open up your word that's Heavenly
[15:15] places when he takes you from Faith to
[15:17] Virtue that's Heavenly places he's
[15:19] taking you on a journey through Heavenly
[15:20] places from from from from glory and
[15:23] Glory as he opens his word so let's see
[15:26] I I I the way this little program works
[15:28] I I I brother brother Dale he's been
[15:31] kind of encouraging us to keep keep our
[15:33] make our own little concordance and
[15:35] record what brother R said about about
[15:37] different scriptures as you read your
[15:38] Bible so that's what I'm doing and if I
[15:41] click this little icon it'll tell me
[15:42] what brother said about Heavenly places
[15:45] so he said in Paradox he said what is it
[15:48] in Exodus the 13th chapter we read that
[15:50] God gave the children of Israel which
[15:52] was a type of the church today as they
[15:53] Journey naturally we're journeying in
[15:55] the spirit next Sunday we're taking that
[15:57] now remember it's all on that now how
[15:59] that they were went on the ground
[16:00] materially like this and God was with
[16:02] them the church is seated with Christ
[16:04] seated with Christ now remember God is
[16:07] enthone on your heart he's seting on the
[16:09] throne of your heart and and he's he's
[16:11] uh we're joined with him so we're seated
[16:13] together because when you get the new
[16:15] birth he's vulcanized his life is
[16:17] vulcanized with your life and it's
[16:18] joined together so that his life just
[16:20] begins to take over with you seated
[16:23] together in Heavenly places with all
[16:25] dominions under our feet yes and they
[16:27] had a pillar of fire a light that they
[16:29] followed wherever this light went they
[16:30] followed that light thousands of years
[16:32] has passed hundreds of years has went by
[16:34] and it's still alive a
[16:35] paradox let me scroll down we are
[16:38] assembled in Heavenly it means that the
[16:40] position of the believer and the
[16:42] position the believer comes to their
[16:43] position by the opening of the word
[16:45] that's that's what Ephesians is all
[16:47] about remember brother R compar compared
[16:49] Ephesians to the Book of Joshua how
[16:52] after they came over in the promised
[16:53] land the the Holy Spirit began to place
[16:55] the believer and put them into the place
[16:57] that they were supposed to be and
[16:59] Ephesians begins to place the Believer
[17:01] by telling them what they're supposed to
[17:02] do what happens after the New Birth the
[17:04] the end goal is not just to be born
[17:06] again but you begin to grow up in Christ
[17:08] and he begins to put you in the
[17:10] different places you should be to
[17:12] fulfill the some there's there's there
[17:14] fivefold Ministry there's deacons
[17:16] there's song leaders there's different
[17:17] places uh positions that have to be
[17:19] filled in the body of Christ and he puts
[17:21] everybody in that and and we're all
[17:23] marching toward one goal to be adopted
[17:25] to come into perfect obedience with him
[17:30] now look he says that if I'm prayed up
[17:31] you're prayed up or the church has
[17:33] prayed up and we're ready for the
[17:34] message and we have assembled ourselves
[17:36] together as Saints called out baptized
[17:38] with the Holy Ghost filled with God's
[17:40] blessings called elected set together in
[17:42] Heavenly places now we are heavenli in
[17:45] our souls our Spirits has brought us
[17:47] into a Heavenly atmosphere oh brother
[17:50] there you are a Heavenly atmosphere now
[17:53] think about that you know brother R said
[17:56] your atmosphere is your attitude toward
[17:58] his word word so when you get into
[18:00] church and and and everything in your
[18:02] life's up you you prayed up and and your
[18:04] your attitude is right and you're you
[18:05] meditate on on God's word it changes the
[18:08] atmosphere your conversation changes the
[18:10] atmosphere when you talk to other
[18:11] believers and they they're having a hard
[18:13] time and You Begin virtue flows out of
[18:15] you and you start encouraging them and
[18:16] saying I know that all right here we
[18:22] go I I know God's word says that God's
[18:25] able to bring you out I know God's word
[18:27] is able to to make this pass in your
[18:30] life then that sets an atmosphere it
[18:32] creates an atmosphere around you and and
[18:35] his his atmosphere is Heavenly places
[18:38] because your soul by the Born Again
[18:39] spirit is not bound to this earth
[18:41] anymore your soul is already redeemed
[18:44] your soul is in take it on up to the
[18:46] next level of justification where who
[18:48] can charge anything to God's elect who
[18:50] could when you look at a born- again
[18:51] believer they ain't no charge you can
[18:53] bring against their soul because they're
[18:54] perfect in Christ Jesus and their soul
[18:56] is in Heavenly places but that act that
[18:59] that Redemptive act has to keep on going
[19:01] up from the soul to the spirit and the
[19:03] body which is the to Wi the Redemption
[19:04] of the body to understand what's going
[19:06] to take place to change our bodies
[19:09] that's what the book of Ephesians is
[19:10] about right blessing us with what Divine
[19:14] Healing here's Heavenly places now he
[19:16] LTS them all out Heavenly places
[19:18] blessing us with a word Divine Healing
[19:21] for knowledge Revelation Visions Powers
[19:26] tongues interpretation
[19:29] wisdom knowledge all the Heavenly
[19:32] blessings and joy unspeakable and full
[19:35] of Glory every heart fill with the
[19:37] spirit walking together setting together
[19:39] in Heavenly places not one evil thought
[19:42] Among Us not one cigarette smoke not one
[19:46] short dress not one this that or the
[19:48] other not one evil thought nobody got
[19:51] anything against one another everybody
[19:54] speaking in love and harmony everybody
[19:57] with one Accord in one place and then
[20:00] suddenly they come from Heaven a sound
[20:01] like a rushing Mighty Wind there you are
[20:04] has blessed us with all spiritual
[20:06] blessings that's what happens when
[20:07] you're sitting in Heavenly places
[20:09] because God gives you access to walk
[20:11] Beyond the Veil like brother like Paul
[20:13] talked about he he's tore the the veil
[20:16] through so we could we could walk in and
[20:18] have access to all the Heavenly
[20:20] blessings all all all the Heavenly
[20:22] places places places because you're on a
[20:25] journey and he's taking you from one
[20:27] blessing to the next until we come to
[20:29] the final blessing Unity with God true
[20:32] Oneness according as he ha chosen Us in
[20:34] him before the foundation of the world
[20:37] and that we should be holy and Without
[20:39] Blame before him in love having adopt
[20:43] you can see my little my little my
[20:44] little notes Here I just I just read
[20:46] through I just put these little things
[20:48] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[20:50] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[20:53] according to the good pleasure of his
[20:54] will now you know these these two
[20:57] scriptures and one two of the most
[20:59] controversial scriptures in all the
[21:01] Bible it's it's broke up churches it's
[21:03] broke up the predestination and and this
[21:05] idea that of of choosing did God choose
[21:09] you or did you choose him or is it a
[21:13] combination of the two now I got I got
[21:16] some quotes here I'll read in the
[21:17] second but that whole now let's go let's
[21:20] go back through history for a second and
[21:22] look at how Martin Luther believed this
[21:24] and look at how John whistle believed it
[21:25] and look then look at how brother R
[21:27] believed it choosing CH did God choose
[21:29] you now Martin Luther said
[21:31] predestination was a topic that should
[21:33] be avoided he said every time I start
[21:35] thinking about predestination I start
[21:36] making God do things that that almost
[21:38] seems evil cuz he had it in his mind
[21:40] that that that he he couldn't quite
[21:43] straighten it out he could see
[21:45] justification and he could see part of
[21:47] the scripture but there was still loose
[21:48] sins that needed to be tied up see and
[21:51] and as you keep progressing John Wesley
[21:53] had a little bit higher understanding of
[21:54] it John Wesley said if you make God to
[21:57] choose some people and and to to
[21:59] Salvation and choose other people to be
[22:01] lost then you make him worse than the
[22:03] devil because how can you stand before
[22:05] just God on the day of judgment and say
[22:07] that
[22:08] uh and judge them in any way because
[22:11] there's no there instead of judging them
[22:13] by the word and how they reacted to the
[22:14] word where they accepted the promises of
[22:16] God you're you're judging them by by on
[22:18] something that they had no part in they
[22:19] had no control over all they all they
[22:21] were was just kind of a a a a kind of a
[22:24] leaf floating down the stream and and
[22:27] then we come on up to to brother brandom
[22:29] who kind of put the put the thoughts
[22:31] together and and set us right down that
[22:34] razor edge of his word to show us
[22:38] exactly what's happening
[22:42] right and I know this is just a huge
[22:45] topic I'm just kind of going through
[22:46] here on the Fly I don't I didn't have
[22:48] any really prepared thoughts or anything
[22:51] this is
[22:53] good when did God choose
[22:55] us when did God choose you that's got
[22:58] the Holy Ghost when did he choose you
[23:00] before the foundation of the world by
[23:01] his for knowledge he foresaw you and
[23:04] know that you would love him and before
[23:06] there was a foundation of the world he
[23:08] chose you and sent Jesus that he might
[23:10] be the propitiation of your sins to call
[23:12] you to reconciliation to himself to love
[23:15] oh wish we had just a few more minutes
[23:20] time we have the same right today in the
[23:23] church he said in the sardian church
[23:24] names are going to be blotted out of the
[23:26] book of life no names will be blotted
[23:28] out of the book of eternal life for that
[23:30] is another record though contained in
[23:32] the book of life this is the record God
[23:34] ha given us eternal life and this life
[23:36] is in his son and he that hath the son
[23:39] hath life eternal and he that hath not
[23:41] the son hath not life eternal and those
[23:43] who have that life were in him before
[23:45] the foundation of the world they were
[23:47] chosen in him before the foundation of
[23:49] the world that great Royal Sea Jesus
[23:52] Christ was planted he died and that life
[23:54] that was in him came up through the
[23:56] wheat plant and is reproducing it itself
[23:58] in multitudes of wheat seeds having the
[24:00] same life in them and being like the
[24:03] original because by Spirit they are
[24:05] original now see this talk goes all the
[24:08] way back to Genesis 12627 where there
[24:10] was a man uh that came forth manifested
[24:14] and and and you couldn't really
[24:16] understand it but then that man was put
[24:18] in Jesus Christ and in him were all the
[24:19] attributes we were identified in him
[24:21] like brother talked about how when he
[24:23] walked down the shores of Galilee we
[24:24] were identified in him we we were in him
[24:26] when he died when we were in him when he
[24:28] rose and all the things here we go
[24:34] again
[24:36] Hallelujah so when he when his when his
[24:38] side was pierced and out from his side
[24:41] came came the the water and the blood
[24:44] and then the spirit left him just like
[24:46] out of his side out of the side of the
[24:48] Ark of the Covenant was the law of the
[24:49] tablets and they would take that out and
[24:51] read it and and expose what was in the
[24:53] side of the Arc of the Covenant the Lord
[24:55] the the law and the Commandments and so
[24:58] that man everything that was in him on
[25:01] the as he walked the shores of Galilee
[25:03] he made a way for all that to be
[25:05] expressed back in people so if you were
[25:07] part of him if you were in him he knew
[25:10] that you would accept it one day and so
[25:12] he had it prepared and God never has a
[25:13] new thought he never has a new idea so
[25:16] he always knew you would accept it and
[25:18] by that way he could predestinate it he
[25:20] would have it waiting for you ready for
[25:21] you and even so much as he said brother
[25:24] said that he bred this one to that one
[25:26] and and it all down to to to get you to
[25:29] get you here so that you would be here
[25:31] waiting and ready to receive
[25:33] it that just doesn't that just blow your
[25:35] mind and you know one thing Martin
[25:37] Luther said that I just really love is
[25:38] predestination if you even if you don't
[25:40] understand it clearly predestination was
[25:42] was meant to give the believer Comfort
[25:45] right even if you can't quite wrap your
[25:48] mind around it believe that you were
[25:50] predestinated in him God always knew
[25:53] that you would believe it so he had the
[25:54] word waiting for you and that and that
[25:57] gives the believer
[25:59] Comfort having predestinated us unto the
[26:02] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[26:05] himself according to the good pleasure
[26:06] of his will unto the adoption of
[26:09] children now you know we know adoption
[26:11] goes through many different stages the
[26:12] first stage of adoption is that you you
[26:14] you are just some nobody out in the
[26:16] world and just like just like how
[26:18] natural adoption Works he you go out and
[26:20] to the adoption agencies there's a lot
[26:22] of different kids that you don't know
[26:24] from anybody and and you look through
[26:25] them and you make you you make your
[26:27] selection however way you that solation
[26:30] works it might be that you like the way
[26:32] this child looks or it might be you do
[26:33] some background research and and and all
[26:36] those different things come to pass that
[26:38] you select a child and you adopt him
[26:41] into your family well the way this works
[26:44] is that the the the spiritual adoption
[26:46] is that there's a a barbarian out there
[26:49] like like how Paul used to describe it
[26:50] somebody that don't know anything about
[26:52] God but they hear the word preached and
[26:54] then they come they come running to the
[26:56] gospel they and they're adopted into the
[26:58] family but that's not the end of the
[27:00] story you keep growing on up until until
[27:03] you come to the manifestation of the
[27:04] sons of God which is uh a period down
[27:07] through the church age history and a
[27:09] period in your own personal life because
[27:10] what God is doing through the church
[27:11] ages he's also got to do in your own
[27:14] personal life that's what that's what
[27:15] escapes so many people is that the story
[27:18] of the son of man the story of the Seven
[27:20] Church ages the story of the stature of
[27:22] perfect man is not just through the
[27:24] church ages but it's the Redemption
[27:25] story in your own personal life and
[27:27] that's what's being revealed in the
[27:29] seals the seals reveal time periods and
[27:31] histories but they also reveal what's
[27:33] God is doing in your own personal life
[27:36] and you got to see when God when you see
[27:38] full redemption in your life full
[27:40] Redemption is what we're talking about
[27:42] full Redemption then we're going to be
[27:44] we're going to go in the Rapture and
[27:46] that's what verse seven is about and I'm
[27:47] going to end on this and whom we have
[27:50] let me turn on my inner linear and I'm G
[27:53] click on this word you can see this is
[27:55] the original Greek word for that that
[27:57] word Redemption
[27:58] and down here you can see kind of the
[28:00] translation full Redemption is the is
[28:04] the meaning the underlying meaning of
[28:06] that word in whom we have Redemption
[28:09] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[28:11] sins according to the riches of his
[28:13] grace what is full Redemption when your
[28:16] soul is redeemed it's absolutely perfect
[28:18] when your spirit is perfectly in line
[28:20] with this with with God's word then
[28:22] you're coming even more and more toward
[28:25] true Oneness with God right but when
[28:27] your body is changed that is the full
[28:30] Redemption for you for your body what
[28:33] about when the world is changed when God
[28:35] through through water and his blood
[28:37] dripping on the earth and then by fire
[28:39] purges the Earth so that he can bring in
[28:42] a New Jerusalem bring in a new city and
[28:44] make all things new then that will be
[28:47] the full Redemption for the Earth so
[28:49] God's doing something that that he might
[28:52] be all in all everything will be
[28:54] returned back to its original condition
[28:56] and that's the mystery that Paul is
[28:58] talking about the mystery that God would
[29:00] reveal himself fully in Jesus Christ and
[29:03] then that God would reveal himself fully
[29:06] in his bride so fully that the Saints
[29:09] would Rise Up from the dead and his
[29:11] whole body would be present on the earth
[29:13] at once and then all together we'll go
[29:15] and meet him in the
[29:17] air and and then come back after the
[29:20] tribulation and and rest for a thousand
[29:23] years and then God will Purge off of the
[29:25] battle of go and may God all the fire
[29:27] all the Earth with the Holy Fire and and
[29:30] and restore all things back and I'm
[29:33] going to stop right there preach it
[29:34] brother
[29:36] [Music]
