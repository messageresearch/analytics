[30:45] were but a few and a few men in number
[30:47] he had very few and strangers in it
[30:50] when they went from one nation to
[30:52] another
[30:52] from one kingdom to another people he
[30:55] suffered no man to do them wrong
[30:57] yeah he reproved kings for their sakes
[31:00] saying
[31:01] touch not mine anointed and do my
[31:04] prophets no harm you may be seated
[31:11] you think about david crying out to the
[31:12] lord and saying all those things about
[31:14] how that god had always been with them
[31:16] and protected them no matter where
[31:20] no matter where they went or uh you
[31:22] remember the as the children of israel
[31:24] went through the wilderness and and uh
[31:26] god was constantly with them with the
[31:28] pillar of fire and and protecting them
[31:30] everywhere they went and his brother
[31:31] aaron was speaking on this morning when
[31:33] they crossed over the red sea uh crossed
[31:35] over the jordan river and uh the fear of
[31:37] the of the people began to come into the
[31:39] uh into the into the into the people of
[31:42] the cities all around of jericho and
[31:44] they looked at what was coming across
[31:46] and they began to
[31:47] remember all the things that they had
[31:49] heard about god doing for those people
[31:51] and it began to cause them to become
[31:52] fearful and and you know that's really
[31:54] what respect is and
[31:56] respects his respects is what we owe to
[31:59] god and you know when you can see god
[32:01] doing something and
[32:02] i believe certainly god is doing
[32:04] something in the bride around the world
[32:05] and certainly god is doing something in
[32:08] the church here and certainly i believe
[32:10] that uh surely you see that god is doing
[32:12] something in your own life and if you
[32:14] don't see that god is doing something in
[32:16] your life then maybe it's time to just
[32:18] get maybe get along with god and get
[32:19] desperate that god will open your eyes
[32:21] up to see what god is doing in this hour
[32:24] when you see what god is doing now then
[32:26] you begin to get respectful of it you
[32:28] begin to get fearful of it like like how
[32:30] the the with the people of jericho maybe
[32:32] rahab looking out her window his brother
[32:34] aaron was speaking of this morning
[32:35] looking out and seeing them march across
[32:37] and seeing them led by a pillar of fire
[32:39] and led by the word and god doing signs
[32:42] and wonders in their midst and they
[32:43] began to look and see that god was able
[32:45] to god was on these people's side and
[32:48] look and be and they began to look and
[32:50] be fearful now brother brahma said that
[32:52] in all things that we see going on we
[32:54] must give respects to it we must go we
[32:56] must give respects to it we must go we
[32:59] must give respect when we come into the
[33:00] house of god we give respect to this
[33:02] place when we when we look at one
[33:04] another
[33:06] tabernacle for a holy god we give
[33:07] respects to one another when you hear
[33:09] the word coming from behind the pulpit
[33:11] you give respects to the pulpit you give
[33:13] respects to the office of the ministers
[33:15] you give respect to the prophet that god
[33:17] was tabernacled in moving in and
[33:19] speaking through you give respect to
[33:21] that and when you give respects to the
[33:23] to what god is doing now that something
[33:25] will begin to happen in your life and
[33:27] when you begin to give respect or don't
[33:29] give respects if you disrespect god god
[33:32] and what he's doing now then something
[33:34] will begin to happen in your life
[33:36] you see everything handed you got a
[33:37] choice whether you will respect what god
[33:40] is doing or you will disrespect it
[33:42] you've got a choice laying there before
[33:43] you when you you you respect the word
[33:45] that's on display now you see if you go
[33:48] back to ecclesiastes 12
[33:50] verses 13 and 14
[33:52] solomon would say that the whole
[33:54] conclusion of the whole thing the whole
[33:56] if you just can kind of sum up
[33:58] everything that we believe is it's fear
[34:00] god
[34:01] let us hear the conclusion of the whole
[34:03] matter fear god and keep his
[34:05] commandments for this is the whole duty
[34:07] of man so what's your duty what's your
[34:09] duty this afternoon your duty is to come
[34:11] with us respect a fervent a a respect
[34:15] for what who god is and that we've got
[34:17] to we've got to lay our lives down
[34:19] before god and we don't come we're just
[34:21] a haphazard way just laughing and
[34:23] frolicking like the american spirit
[34:25] would have you do but we've been we've
[34:27] been pulled out of the american spirit
[34:29] we've been given a new spirit we've been
[34:31] given a spirit that
[34:32] gives us a sound mind has transformed
[34:35] our thinking
[34:36] so paul uh solomon said for god shall
[34:38] bring every work into judgment with
[34:40] every secret thing whether it be good or
[34:43] whether it be evil so that's why we fear
[34:45] we fear because we want to be right we
[34:47] fear because we want to do right and
[34:49] when you do wrong if you're not born
[34:51] again if you do wrong you know there's
[34:52] maybe this afternoon sitting here you
[34:54] know that you're not right and there's
[34:56] something within you that you want to be
[34:58] right and i want to declare to you that
[35:00] the only way that you can ever be right
[35:01] is to get born again to get that true
[35:03] token that brother aaron was talking
[35:05] about this morning the only way that you
[35:07] can ever be right is to take upon
[35:09] yourself the nature of that the
[35:10] righteous one and that's the only way
[35:12] that you can have a righteousness to
[35:14] have your right his righteousness
[35:16] applied to you
[35:17] so the conclusion of the whole matter is
[35:19] to fear god and then brother adam said
[35:22] you cannot have respects until you have
[35:24] fear you've got to have fear of god
[35:28] all you think about how somebody when
[35:30] they become to a place of fear something
[35:32] strikes within their heart and they
[35:33] begin something begins to move and then
[35:35] something begins to pulsating in them
[35:37] and they begin to respond to a holy god
[35:40] like isaiah told me we were talking
[35:41] about this morning when god got him to a
[35:43] place where he looked at the seraphim
[35:46] and he began to his his influence that
[35:48] what he was looking at began to get
[35:50] steered away from uriah to a holy god
[35:53] sitting there with seraphim's
[35:54] proclaiming holy holy holy and the
[35:56] temple began to shake and he began to
[35:58] come under the atmosphere of a fearful
[36:01] god something to be respected
[36:03] you know like brother adam would say
[36:05] whenever he got in the presence of that
[36:06] angel he said you don't laugh or you
[36:08] don't joke but you're you're there you
[36:10] know that there's a presence of
[36:12] something beyond your mortal
[36:13] comprehension something there that's
[36:15] that's come from the office of god come
[36:17] from the throne of god to speak to you
[36:20] and proverbs chapter 9 verse 10 says the
[36:22] fear of the lord is the beginning of
[36:24] wisdom the fear of the lord is the
[36:26] beginning of the wisdom and the
[36:28] knowledge of the holy is understanding
[36:30] so this afternoon maybe this afternoon
[36:32] if you come with a frolic or come with
[36:35] maybe all these worldly ideas in your
[36:37] mind i want to strike fear in your heart
[36:39] this afternoon
[36:40] maybe you've come with with all these
[36:42] worldly emotions and worldly worldly
[36:44] ideas but it's time to get serious about
[36:46] something it's time to get serious about
[36:48] your soul it's time to get serious about
[36:51] your life and where you're going and
[36:52] what's gonna happen to you when you die
[36:54] it's time to get serious and it's time
[36:56] to fear god because god the bible says
[36:59] that's where all wisdom starts the bible
[37:02] says that's where your duty starts your
[37:04] duty is to fear god
[37:08] now fear the bible will say fear is an
[37:11] awesome terrifying thing
[37:14] fear is
[37:15] fear is terror
[37:18] fear is related to an object causing
[37:20] fear
[37:21] fear
[37:22] the fear of god respect
[37:25] respect reverence
[37:27] piety
[37:28] fear is when you revere something you
[37:30] come into the holy atmosphere of god and
[37:33] you come into the presence of god i
[37:35] believe that's why in the church you
[37:36] come to church to get in that atmosphere
[37:38] where believers are bringing their
[37:39] little licks of fire not just bringing
[37:41] together an intellectual conception but
[37:43] where the power of god is gathered
[37:46] together with the people you gather
[37:47] together and you're sitting in heavenly
[37:49] places with the wither with the people
[37:51] of god and and you know that you're in
[37:53] the presence because something's moving
[37:55] in the building you come into the you
[37:57] come into the sanctuary of the lord and
[37:59] if you need a healing touch or you need
[38:01] to be uplifted or you need to be edified
[38:03] it's here in the house of god because
[38:05] where his word is and where two or three
[38:07] are gathered in my name he said i'll be
[38:09] there
[38:12] now fear fear is when you get in that
[38:14] atmosphere he said that don't mean
[38:16] you're afraid of him but that means that
[38:18] you're giving respect and reverence and
[38:20] when you respect god when you respect
[38:23] god you fear him when you respect god
[38:26] you fear him
[38:29] will you come to god consciousness come
[38:31] to
[38:32] come to an understanding that there's
[38:33] something more going on here than just
[38:35] some old tired people gathered together
[38:37] but there's actually a living god
[38:39] congregating himself and moving and
[38:41] tabernacling him in the people he said
[38:44] you fear that you might displease him in
[38:46] some way you fear lest you would do
[38:48] something wrong i wonder this afternoon
[38:50] how many of us have that kind of a fear
[38:53] well we're afraid that we'll do
[38:54] something wrong afraid that we'll do
[38:56] something that will cast a stumbling
[38:58] block in front of somebody's eyes
[39:00] cast a stumbling block where maybe
[39:02] somebody would look at us and see what
[39:03] you're drinking you're going around
[39:04] sneaking behind closed doors drinking
[39:06] alcohol and getting drunk and stuff or
[39:08] you're going around and smoking pot and
[39:10] doing things and calling yourself a
[39:12] christian but yet
[39:15] where you should be afraid that somebody
[39:17] would know what you're doing and that
[39:19] would cast a stumbling block i believe
[39:21] that ministers of the congregation alike
[39:23] everybody from the top to the bottom
[39:25] should live in holiness and piety
[39:28] walking a straight narrow way because
[39:30] why what are we looking for what are we
[39:32] seeking for we're seeking like brother
[39:33] aaron was saying at the end of the
[39:34] journey we're seeking to come to the
[39:37] full adoption to come to the
[39:39] oneness with christ now brother evan
[39:41] said i fear my mother i fear my mother
[39:45] think about the way he said this i fear
[39:46] my mother
[39:47] i fear my wife
[39:50] i fear my church
[39:52] i fear all of god's servants unless i
[39:54] should put a stumbling block somewhere
[39:56] in our way
[39:57] i fear my mother you know maybe many of
[40:00] us many of this morning
[40:02] maybe many of you sitting here this
[40:03] morning have family members that are not
[40:05] believers or that maybe they don't know
[40:07] anything about god or maybe they know a
[40:10] little bit about what their denomination
[40:11] has told them but maybe they've been
[40:13] resistant to to maybe what some of the
[40:14] things that you've been sharing i wonder
[40:17] maybe let's examine ourselves tonight
[40:18] have we cast a stumbling block you know
[40:20] as brother aaron was mentioning this
[40:22] morning i'm going to be referring to
[40:23] brother aaron a lot because it was such
[40:25] a good sermon but you the world is
[40:28] looking for somebody that's genuine he
[40:30] the world is looking for somebody that's
[40:32] real somebody that can put on display
[40:35] the real what a real christian it is not
[40:37] some of this make-believe stuff
[40:39] that's why brother-in-law is saying i
[40:40] fear my church i fear all of god's
[40:43] servants unless i should put something
[40:45] in their way i fear the people i fear
[40:48] the people of the city unless i should
[40:49] do something wrong that would cause him
[40:52] to think that i wasn't a christian
[40:54] you think about that this afternoon is
[40:56] there anything in your life that would
[40:57] cause somebody to think that you are not
[41:00] a christian if they were to uncover what
[41:02] you're reading at night well
[41:03] if they would uncover what you're
[41:05] watching at night with the netflix and
[41:07] stuff in the privacy of your home own
[41:09] home or what what things what if it were
[41:11] to get out in public what you're doing
[41:14] maybe if young person were to get in the
[41:16] car with you and find out that you're
[41:17] listening to the wrong kind of music or
[41:19] music that sounds wrong or or maybe
[41:21] you're slipping out when you get really
[41:23] upset you slip out with them cuss words
[41:25] and maybe maybe you think well it's all
[41:26] right and everything
[41:28] it's not gonna bother anything but you
[41:30] see it matters i'm talking about fear of
[41:32] god's people fear of god fear of fear of
[41:36] casting a stumbling block in front of
[41:38] somebody i'm talking about towing the
[41:40] line of holiness of living right and
[41:43] doing right
[41:44] he said doing something to hinder the
[41:46] spirit you see what fear fear means what
[41:49] it really means is care do you care this
[41:52] afternoon do you care about living a
[41:54] holy life do you care about coming to
[41:56] church when you need to be here do you
[41:58] care about getting into the bible and
[42:00] seeing what the bible says for your own
[42:02] self like the bereans did
[42:04] and brother brown said before you can
[42:06] have respect
[42:07] you've got to have fear
[42:09] and god demands it
[42:11] he demands respect
[42:13] god does he demands it and fear brings
[42:17] it we know that fear brings respect
[42:21] now that we know that god and the bible
[42:23] is represented by the lion a lion of the
[42:25] tribe of judah and whenever you would
[42:27] hear a lion roar in the jungle instantly
[42:29] everybody would get quiet why because
[42:31] they're afraid is it close to me
[42:33] is it in the bushes is it about to leap
[42:35] out on me and that just the voice of
[42:37] that lion and steals respect the voice
[42:40] of that line causes people to respond
[42:42] that's how god when you hear the voice
[42:45] of god when you get in his presence it
[42:47] instills fear and respect now now you
[42:50] see what it what it is though brother
[42:52] i'm saying take for instance a farmer a
[42:54] farmer a shop worker and nobody pays
[42:57] attention to him
[42:59] look at all of our backgrounds we come
[43:00] from a lot of different backgrounds
[43:02] whether you're a farmer or a shop worker
[43:04] or or a computer
[43:06] engineer or whatever it is we all come
[43:08] from a lot of different backgrounds but
[43:10] you see you could take a farmer or a
[43:11] shop worker or whoever it is and you
[43:13] might not respect them that much
[43:15] they're a farmer or or whatever but he
[43:18] said let him get a job on the police
[43:20] force
[43:21] and come down the street as a policeman
[43:23] with his badge and uniform on
[43:25] let that farmer let that farmer get put
[43:27] into that office
[43:29] and then then see everything changes let
[43:31] that farmer you see it's the office what
[43:34] it is it's the holy ghost and the people
[43:37] that you're respecting you have a
[43:38] respect for god and one another you're
[43:41] respecting what god is doing now that's
[43:44] why i'm talking about respect for what
[43:45] god is doing now god is doing something
[43:48] in his people right now he's doing
[43:50] something he's he's performing something
[43:53] if we can respect what god is doing
[43:55] right now right now in this church
[43:58] service right now in your lives right
[44:01] now in this age he's doing something
[44:02] he's bringing people to adoption he's
[44:05] bringing he's fulfilling his word
[44:07] you know brother brown said who would
[44:09] who would president john f kennedy be
[44:11] if he wasn't president and i'll say it
[44:13] maybe tonight who would president biden
[44:15] be if he wasn't president biden and i'm
[44:18] not talking about whatever your
[44:19] political affiliation is just lay that
[44:20] to the side i'm talking about the man
[44:23] the man if he was not in that office he
[44:25] would be just a man
[44:27] that's how any any person without the
[44:28] baptism in the holy ghost that true
[44:30] token would be if you take somebody and
[44:32] just put them over to somebody maybe a
[44:34] homeless person in the ditch or a worker
[44:37] somewhere out there but then you fill
[44:38] them with the holy ghost
[44:40] and now you've got god tabernacle
[44:42] tabernacling on the inside
[44:45] you're you're respecting god when you
[44:47] respect one another
[44:49] you think about
[44:51] have you ever watched one of those
[44:52] courtrooms and you see how everybody
[44:54] respects the judge back up there sitting
[44:56] behind the behind the stand with his
[44:58] gavel and he's got that black robe on
[45:01] but but at home maybe maybe his kids
[45:03] talk all over him and and his what maybe
[45:05] his wife didn't listen to him and
[45:07] all kinds of things at home but in the
[45:09] office of that judge the people in that
[45:11] courtroom respect and they say your
[45:13] honor your honor because they're
[45:15] respecting the office that that judge is
[45:17] in and brother adam said god is god he
[45:21] deserves the respect
[45:22] god has demanded that for himself and
[45:24] for all his servants god demands respect
[45:27] for his servants his servants now how we
[45:30] know that they're his servants because
[45:32] he vindicates these servants by his word
[45:36] how does god vindicate his servants he
[45:38] vindicates his servants by by proving
[45:40] that they have a correct revelation that
[45:42] lines up with the word by proving
[45:44] because the life that of that revelation
[45:46] is borne out that's why brother adam
[45:48] would say you can't have
[45:50] faith without works you believe and
[45:52] you're going to be living a good life
[45:55] you're going to be living a righteous
[45:56] life because the faith that you believe
[45:58] will produce a holy life you're not
[46:01] going to be out there wallowing around
[46:02] in all the time you're out of the world
[46:04] but you're going to be living a life
[46:05] that is deserving of respect his servant
[46:08] he said he takes these servants and
[46:10] makes them servants of god and proves
[46:12] that they are servants by making his
[46:15] word work through them servants that's
[46:18] why you could take somebody that's
[46:19] yielded to the holy ghost to be yielded
[46:21] to the holy ghost and power and signs
[46:23] and wonders will be done in their life
[46:26] the bible says that their dream dreams
[46:28] and see visions and you'll see a trail
[46:30] of things following behind them because
[46:32] it's written in god's word and god's
[46:35] word cannot lie his word is true
[46:39] then brother abraham said then as you
[46:40] respect that servant you respect god
[46:44] so when i respect you
[46:46] and you respect me
[46:48] and we respect each other then we're
[46:50] respecting god
[46:52] how can that be brother bob how can that
[46:55] be because god is tabernacling in you
[46:57] tonight that's what i'm talking about
[46:59] that god is doing something now he's
[47:02] doing something now he's from the day of
[47:04] pentecost until now he's been
[47:06] tabernacling in people and it's been
[47:08] growing and growing and grow growing
[47:10] until god is truly doing something now
[47:13] if we can open our eyes to see what that
[47:15] is
[47:17] if you can respect one another when you
[47:19] respect one another you're respecting
[47:20] god
[47:22] that's why matthew 25 says then shall he
[47:24] answer them saying verily i say unto you
[47:26] and as much as you did it to one of
[47:28] these least
[47:30] you did it not to me
[47:32] as you did it not to one of the least of
[47:34] these you did it not to me
[47:36] you think about that
[47:37] the least in the kingdom of heaven
[47:40] a little a little child now of course
[47:42] the bible says the least in the kingdom
[47:44] of heaven is greater than john the
[47:45] baptist but the least in the kingdom of
[47:47] heaven the one that's that maybe just
[47:50] just got the new birth yesterday
[47:52] if you do something to them if you treat
[47:55] them right and respect them and treat
[47:58] them right it's as though you're doing
[48:00] it to god himself
[48:02] the matthew chapter 18 says take he that
[48:04] you despise not one of these little ones
[48:06] for i say unto you that in heaven their
[48:08] angels do always behold the face of my
[48:10] father which is in heaven they've got
[48:12] something supernatural working in their
[48:15] life that's why i want to say maybe to
[48:16] these these young girls sitting here

[49:07] [Applause]
[49:11] brother adam said we know that we being
[49:13] children of god that we are a part of
[49:15] god and god demands this respect and
[49:18] then god shows you who his children are
[49:24] he shows you who his children are
[49:26] oh my if we could examine this afternoon
[49:28] how god shows who his children are
[49:30] what's the effects of respecting god's
[49:32] word what's the effect of coming up to
[49:34] god's word and discerning whether it's
[49:37] true or not and having the right kind of
[49:38] response to it
[49:40] you know in noah's day when noah began
[49:42] to preach and he began to all the world
[49:44] looked like a
[49:45] began to regard him like some kind of a
[49:46] lunatic up there they say there ain't
[49:48] even any water in the sky and you're up
[49:50] there preaching like a man man building
[49:52] a building a big boat up on a hill and
[49:54] there's no water from miles maybe no
[49:56] water in the sky no water around no way
[49:59] you didn't even maybe build a thing next
[50:00] to a lake or something that maybe would
[50:02] have made a lot of sense and everything
[50:04] seemed to be contrary to him but brother
[50:06] rama said now noah had a revelation from
[50:08] god yet it was contrary to anything that
[50:11] science would prove to be true but yet
[50:13] he had spoken to god and god had spake
[50:16] to him so if god had spoken to him and
[50:18] gave him a revelation of what was true
[50:20] then anything if you would give that man
[50:22] respect then you would be respect it
[50:24] would be accounted as though you were
[50:26] respecting god
[50:28] and he went about preparing an ark where
[50:30] the scoffers and mockers scoffed at noah
[50:32] they thought that he was out of his head
[50:34] because he was building an ark but god
[50:36] brought judgment upon them scoffers
[50:38] because they would not listen to the
[50:40] messenger of god and come into that ark
[50:42] under his preaching now see if you would
[50:45] respond to noah's preaching in that day
[50:48] if you would have respected what noah
[50:50] was preaching your revelation would have
[50:52] taken you into that ark and sealed you
[50:54] behind those doors that god had shut and
[50:56] carried you away and taken you into
[50:58] another world taking you away from all
[51:00] that sin and everything until they when
[51:02] the doors open they were in a new world
[51:04] and there was no seeing all the sin had
[51:06] been cleansed off it had been purged and
[51:08] now they they come out and they were
[51:10] they were in a different place you see
[51:12] if you respect god god will do something
[51:14] back for you now brother allah said you
[51:16] can only do things to do two things it
[51:19] lays either mercy or judgment you have
[51:21] to accept one or the other and there is
[51:24] where we stand tonight we either take
[51:25] god's mercy or we stand his judgment and
[51:28] you could this afternoon you can either
[51:29] take god's mercy or rest or stand his
[51:32] judgment by respecting what god is doing
[51:34] now or disrespecting what god is doing
[51:37] now
[51:38] and moses day
[51:41] brother rahm said that people should
[51:43] have understanding
[51:44] understood according to the scripture
[51:46] that god was going to deliver them and
[51:48] was going to bring them out of egypt
[51:50] because you could go back and read the
[51:52] promise of god to abraham and understand
[51:54] that god they were going to sojourn in
[51:55] the wilderness for so many years and
[51:57] then god was going to bring him out you
[51:59] could go look back in god's word and
[52:01] recognize but as soon as god got his man
[52:04] ready and sent him down into egypt they
[52:05] had no respect for him they turned him
[52:08] out and said will you slay us as you did
[52:10] the egyptian you see they begin to look
[52:12] at moses false they begin to look at his
[52:14] failures and they begin to wonder is
[52:15] this is god really this with this man
[52:18] even after all the many signs and
[52:19] wonders that have been performed by him
[52:22] speaking speaking turning the water into
[52:24] blood and gnats appearing and frogs
[52:26] coming up out of the water and all those
[52:27] different things and brother and said
[52:29] the old generation that laughed at moses
[52:31] and so forth and will not accept the
[52:33] message that generation died off and
[52:36] moses coming to another generation after
[52:38] they'd seen all those signs happen
[52:41] and then they come to the red sea and
[52:42] found out that the very god that had
[52:44] performed all those signs here at the
[52:46] red sea doubted god the very first thing
[52:49] that he was able to make a way
[52:51] of escape
[52:53] if god sent the messenger and vindicated
[52:55] by the signs that he was the messenger
[52:57] sent from god
[52:58] then it's up to them to obey this
[53:00] messenger
[53:01] exactly
[53:02] my you think about all the many signs
[53:04] and wonders that we've seen in this day
[53:05] just signs it was constantly a constant
[53:07] stream of things
[53:08] healings happening and
[53:10] going back and looking at what brother
[53:12] branham said in his and his amazing even
[53:14] you know you know you know even the the
[53:16] the picture of the pillar of fire that
[53:17] we hang on our wall was taken by our
[53:19] critics
[53:20] the critics took the picture of the
[53:22] pillar of fire
[53:25] look at joshua and caleb they stayed
[53:27] right by his side yes sir whatever moses
[53:29] was in they was in it too
[53:31] whether moses was right or wrong they
[53:33] stayed right with him anyhow because
[53:35] they know that god was a messenger you
[53:38] think about what a what a bold statement
[53:40] that is whether moses was right or wrong
[53:43] whether moses within his own human
[53:46] nature was right or wrong you know moses
[53:48] killed an egyptian but yet god was going
[53:51] to use that man
[53:52] moses had a speech impediment he
[53:54] couldn't even talk right he stumbled and
[53:56] stuttered over his words but yet god had
[53:58] chosen that man he was going to use that
[54:00] man you see they got all hung up on his
[54:02] faults and failures they started looking
[54:04] at the man instead of the office that he
[54:06] was in
[54:07] moses faltering at the red sea where god
[54:09] began to scold him he said why cry speak
[54:12] don't you know what you're supposed to
[54:13] be doing and maybe the people began to
[54:15] look at what moses failure in that
[54:17] moment moses you know moses had a temper
[54:20] he come down off the mountain when god
[54:22] gave him the ten commandments and he saw
[54:24] what the children of israel were doing
[54:25] and he busted it all over the rock
[54:27] because he had just he in his own human
[54:30] self he just got so fed up with the
[54:32] people that didn't seem to be responding
[54:34] and he had that temper
[54:37] that was manifested so many to later on
[54:39] he struck the rock when god told him to
[54:40] just speak at it and you could look at
[54:42] that human frailty and say well you know
[54:44] what i don't believe that god is with
[54:46] you anymore moses went and married an
[54:48] egyptian and it looked like that would
[54:50] be the wrong thing to do but yeah the
[54:52] bible said that god told him to do that
[54:54] brother branham said that god wanted him
[54:56] to marry the poorer and he needed to
[54:58] marry the poor but he needed to marry a
[55:00] little hot-headed woman that would yank
[55:02] that
[55:03] that would throw that bloody
[55:04] circumcision at him and said you've been
[55:06] preaching this gospel but you ain't even
[55:08] taking care of your own house he needed
[55:10] a woman that would tell him that tell
[55:12] him that straight
[55:14] and you see how you can get so caught up
[55:16] in looking at somebody's humanity that
[55:18] you forget to think to forget to realize
[55:21] that god is still doing something in
[55:23] somebody's life whether it's the
[55:25] minister whether it's the brother or
[55:26] sister sitting on the period next to you
[55:28] god is doing something right now and you
[55:31] got to respect what god is doing respect
[55:33] one another
[55:35] he said there one day we find out that
[55:37] even miriam a prophetess and heir and
[55:39] the high priest made fun of moses wife
[55:41] because she was an ethiopian i thought
[55:43] wasn't there enough women of our own
[55:44] group to marry instead of going out
[55:46] there and marrying that woman that
[55:48] wasn't moses choice
[55:50] that was god's choice for moses and when
[55:52] they made fun of it that angered god in
[55:54] such a way until he struck miriam the
[55:56] prophetess full of leprosy moses own
[55:58] sister what about that why why did she
[56:00] get struck with leprosy because she
[56:03] disrespected the office she disrespected
[56:06] the spirit of god moving in god's people
[56:08] her prophetess she was a prophetess the
[56:11] word the spirit of god would work in her
[56:13] life but she failed to recognize where
[56:15] the anointing was what was she doing she
[56:18] was making fun and irreverence to god's
[56:20] messenger the messenger of the covenant
[56:23] of that day
[56:24] and she was irreverent
[56:26] god demands respect
[56:29] sends his message
[56:31] you listen to it
[56:33] and you reference it
[56:36] don't care if they call it a bunch of
[56:38] holy rollers or whatever they call it
[56:40] let the world do what they want to
[56:42] but you give respects
[56:44] you think about why they called it holy
[56:46] rollers it's because people would get
[56:48] the penteco early pentecostals would get
[56:50] so under the anointing that they would
[56:52] fall down on the floor or they begin to
[56:54] roll across the floor and run around
[56:55] through the building praising god and
[56:57] you could see the effect of the
[56:59] anointing in their life and people begin
[57:01] to laugh and mock at that you see what
[57:03] he's talking about is when you begin to
[57:04] see the effect the holy ghost in
[57:06] somebody's life don't mock at it don't
[57:08] but be reverent toward it that's why we
[57:10] come to the sanctuary of god with
[57:13] shamefulness and reverence now rev
[57:15] that's what reverence means a sense of
[57:17] shame
[57:18] or honor
[57:20] modesty
[57:21] bashfulness
[57:23] reverence
[57:24] modest modesty means
[57:26] that's why our women clothe themselves
[57:28] because they want to be modest
[57:30] because they're conscious of god doing
[57:32] something in their lives
[57:34] they're they're modest they want to
[57:35] cover themselves up
[57:37] bashfulness
[57:39] reverence regard for others
[57:42] and respect
[57:43] what is reverence is being it's being
[57:45] conscious that there's something going
[57:47] on a deep respect for someone or
[57:50] something profound respect and love
[57:57] excuse me
[58:01] don't you fear god in other words you
[58:03] talk about moses you're talking about me
[58:06] if you can't respect moses you don't
[58:08] respect me
[58:10] said haven't i proved you among that
[58:11] he's my servant and you know you have no
[58:14] reverence for him at all
[58:16] what would that be for a lesson for the
[58:18] people of this day
[58:20] no respects no honor
[58:23] and now he said and because you didn't
[58:25] do that to miriam
[58:26] that's the reason you got leprosy
[58:29] that's the reason these things has went
[58:30] because you ought to have know that this
[58:32] was my servant
[58:34] you do know it so when you say something
[58:37] against him you're saying it against me
[58:39] what do we respect we're expecting the
[58:41] respect and the word for this day
[58:43] presented in flesh
[58:45] the word for this day manifested in
[58:47] flesh
[58:49] we're reverencing our little licks of
[58:51] fire gathered together in this building
[58:53] we're reverencing joining our faith
[58:54] together coming together as believers so
[58:57] that when you if you're if you're in
[58:58] need of something you can have somebody
[59:00] that you respect pray for you somebody
[59:02] that you know has a has a is a is in
[59:05] touch with god you see we got a bible
[59:07] from god in the correct interpretation
[59:09] of that bible and that's what we're
[59:11] reverencing we're we're referencing this
[59:13] afternoon that we're hearing from god
[59:15] and that god is doing something
[59:19] i was i was watching this little
[59:21] portrayal of when uh the the united
[59:23] states split from from england and that
[59:25] and the uh i think it was john adams
[59:27] went over to the just talked to the king
[59:29] after the aft after the uh
[59:32] our independence
[59:34] and you think about what a scary thing
[59:35] that would have been for john adams to
[59:36] step in front of a king that had just
[59:38] went to war with us
[59:40] and he approached he approached
[59:42] in reverence and fear not coming in
[59:44] there all laughing and everything so
[59:46] when you come to when you come to a king
[59:48] you come you come you don't come uh
[59:51] you say well like cain did well you
[59:52] could just take take my way or or leave
[59:55] it i i don't really care what you say
[59:57] but you come with reverence and you know
[59:59] john adams or even brother branham when
[1:00:00] he said when he went to the king the
[1:00:02] king of england he had to approach in a
[1:00:04] certain way and walked in backwards and
[1:00:06] walked in
[1:00:07] or you know i think john adams had to
[1:00:09] bow three times or something like that
[1:00:11] there was an appro a right approach a
[1:00:14] correct approach to the king and that's
[1:00:16] there's a correct approach to the to god
[1:00:18] and it's not just through haphazard and
[1:00:20] laughing and things
[1:00:21] and brother baby said if that was the
[1:00:23] attitude of god in that day and god
[1:00:25] can't change god wants us to respect
[1:00:28] what he's doing
[1:00:29] he demands it you either respect that or
[1:00:32] something else is going to happen now
[1:00:34] i'm not talking about this morning i'm
[1:00:36] not talking about cultish respect well
[1:00:38] you just respect somebody they go out
[1:00:39] and they're alcoholic and you but you're
[1:00:41] still you're still going to church and
[1:00:43] you're listening to them or something
[1:00:44] there's all the all the people that
[1:00:45] we've seen go out abusers and things uh
[1:00:48] going out and fornicating and stuff like
[1:00:50] that that's that's getting into cultish
[1:00:52] mindset but i'm talking about respecting
[1:00:54] something where the word of god has been
[1:00:56] proven out where you can see god living
[1:00:58] on display we're talking about
[1:01:00] respecting the present tense
[1:01:02] spirit-filled unfolding of god's word
[1:01:07] and then brother brown said i know
[1:01:09] i know of three boys one time that mock
[1:01:10] communion
[1:01:12] in the church know of them
[1:01:14] and they went up in the hotel room
[1:01:16] you know what communion represents
[1:01:18] when we come and we get together and we
[1:01:20] we take communion you're taking the wine
[1:01:23] and you're taking the word the bread
[1:01:25] it's a symbol of a symbol of the spirit
[1:01:27] of god quickening the word in your life
[1:01:30] and just as you eat that bread and that
[1:01:32] and that wine it's going it's going to
[1:01:34] turn into molecules in your body and
[1:01:36] it's going to make your body grow just
[1:01:38] as when you eat the word and the spirit
[1:01:40] quickens that is going to make your
[1:01:42] spiritual body your supernatural body
[1:01:44] your theophany body grow on the inside
[1:01:47] of you it's growing and so they began to
[1:01:49] mock that communion in the church he
[1:01:51] said and they went up in the hotel room
[1:01:52] and got some ham sandwiches and a bottle
[1:01:55] of whiskey and had their communion up
[1:01:57] there you see you see why this is not
[1:01:59] something to play around with
[1:02:01] you see if god is really in this there's
[1:02:04] not something to just mock it and and
[1:02:06] and laugh at and cheer at but there's
[1:02:08] something real going on here and he said
[1:02:10] they began to make fun of the communion
[1:02:12] they had in a pentecostal church and
[1:02:14] less than three months from them one of
[1:02:15] them was dead and two of them was in the
[1:02:17] insane institution you can't disrespect
[1:02:20] god you've got to respect god don't make
[1:02:23] fun of the people in the spirit brother
[1:02:24] brahma said he said don't talk about
[1:02:26] people that's worshipping in the spirit
[1:02:28] of god how many times have we seen have
[1:02:30] we heard people do that somebody will be
[1:02:31] praising god and running up down the
[1:02:33] aisle maybe in a special meeting and
[1:02:35] maybe you'll hear somebody that don't
[1:02:36] quite have the the right understanding
[1:02:38] of what's going on and maybe they'll say
[1:02:40] well they don't know what i know
[1:02:42] my you see how you're playing around
[1:02:44] with fire when you begin what if you're
[1:02:46] blaspheming what the actual holy spirit
[1:02:48] is doing you see what people want people
[1:02:50] won't make fun of somebody maybe
[1:02:51] sleeping in church but they'll let
[1:02:53] somebody get a blessing one time and
[1:02:55] somebody will begin to somebody will
[1:02:57] begin to jeer and say well i wonder if
[1:02:58] you drank too much coffee or i wonder if
[1:03:00] you drank too much before that service
[1:03:02] you got to respect god he said you've
[1:03:05] got to believe it watch those who really
[1:03:07] believed it and watch what happens
[1:03:09] you've got to respect him
[1:03:13] now jezebel sir was an example of of
[1:03:16] this day jezebel with her painted eyes
[1:03:17] and and brother brown said how she
[1:03:19] disrespected elijah elijah elijah was
[1:03:23] actually her pastor she should have been
[1:03:25] going over to elijah's church he should
[1:03:27] have been sitting under under his
[1:03:28] teaching and listening to what he she he
[1:03:30] said and he said oh she wouldn't receive
[1:03:33] that
[1:03:33] goodness no she was an atheist or an
[1:03:35] infidel or idol worshiper and she had
[1:03:37] her own pagan priest she wouldn't
[1:03:38] receive it at all and she disrespected
[1:03:41] him she hated him why did she hate him
[1:03:43] because he was telling the truth and and
[1:03:45] in all that telling of the truth it
[1:03:47] looked like there was a lot of strange
[1:03:48] things happening the whole nation was
[1:03:50] without water and looked like a lot of
[1:03:52] kids were dying and a lot of chaos it
[1:03:54] looked like but and she she just built
[1:03:57] up within herself all this hatred and
[1:03:59] there she was with her painted up eyes
[1:04:01] and her uh her disrespectful attitude
[1:04:03] and what happened to her god let the
[1:04:05] dogs eat her in the street because she
[1:04:07] disrespected the message that elijah was
[1:04:10] preaching
[1:04:11] sitting there with that disrespect with
[1:04:13] her painted up face and her idolatry and
[1:04:15] her lipstick wearing and word denying
[1:04:18] and murderous going and killing
[1:04:19] neighbors trying to get his vineyard
[1:04:22] why because her whole attitude her own
[1:04:24] mindset was i don't have to do what he
[1:04:27] says
[1:04:28] i don't have to listen to you i don't
[1:04:30] have to listen to that stuff
[1:04:32] i don't like it i don't like all these
[1:04:34] children dying i don't like us being
[1:04:36] without water and i don't have to listen
[1:04:37] to what you saying she was maybe she
[1:04:39] said i don't need all this holiness and
[1:04:42] i don't want your holy rolling i don't
[1:04:44] want a real genuine anointing in my life
[1:04:46] but you see god demands respect you
[1:04:49] gotta have it you ever get anything from
[1:04:51] god you're going to respect god and you
[1:04:54] must do it from your heart the bottom of
[1:04:56] your heart you must do it you see that's
[1:04:59] what this you look around at this
[1:05:00] american spirit that's taken effect even
[1:05:03] in the young people of this days even in
[1:05:04] the young people of this message and
[1:05:06] this cost called the young people from
[1:05:08] cause the old people many of them to get
[1:05:10] disrespectful where they look at the
[1:05:12] preaching the god and the of the gospel
[1:05:14] and they don't want it no more
[1:05:16] you know what the american spirit is the
[1:05:18] american spirit is just laughing at
[1:05:19] everything ha ha ho
[1:05:22] you hear the gospel preached and you
[1:05:24] don't you just want to go home and laugh
[1:05:25] about it you laugh out in the parking
[1:05:27] lot and laugh everywhere you go the
[1:05:29] american spirit is whispering through
[1:05:30] the graveyard knowing that one day
[1:05:32] you're going to come to an end and
[1:05:34] walking by a grave a grave spot that one
[1:05:36] day you might be inhabiting but yeah you
[1:05:38] go through whistling wasting a little
[1:05:40] tune because you're just ignoring
[1:05:43] ignoring what god is doing right now
[1:05:48] he said could you imagine that little
[1:05:50] jezebel with that painted up face
[1:05:53] stumping up and down that floor
[1:05:55] saying that old hypocrite
[1:05:57] that old hypocrite causing all these
[1:05:59] little children out here to suffer see
[1:06:01] sometimes sometimes this is past our
[1:06:03] mental understanding sometimes you can
[1:06:05] look at things going on in the church
[1:06:07] and you don't understand why maybe
[1:06:08] somebody's being treated the way or
[1:06:10] something was said to somebody i don't
[1:06:11] understand that like like naming there i
[1:06:14] don't understand when why elijah won't
[1:06:17] come out and meet me and why he's
[1:06:18] telling me to go dunk myself seven times
[1:06:20] in the old muddy river i don't come out
[1:06:22] i don't understand why he won't come out
[1:06:23] and shake my hand i don't understand why
[1:06:25] he won't come to my house and do what i
[1:06:27] want him to do but elijah was trying to
[1:06:29] bring him back to god
[1:06:31] trying to win a nation back to god
[1:06:34] elijah's message did look pretty bad
[1:06:36] didn't it children suffering
[1:06:38] people suffering cattle dying sheep
[1:06:40] dying no water nowhere the night's hot
[1:06:42] and sultry the sun as bright as brass in
[1:06:44] the skies through the daytime for three
[1:06:46] years and six months and elijah's
[1:06:48] sitting up on the mountain
[1:06:49] saying not even dude will fall
[1:06:51] till i call from him while ravens
[1:06:54] brought him food he was sitting up there
[1:06:55] relaxing
[1:06:57] relaxing next next to the brook while
[1:06:59] god took care of him why because god he
[1:07:01] respected god and so god respected him
[1:07:04] back
[1:07:05] that's what god wants sometimes god will
[1:07:07] take you through a rough spot because
[1:07:09] he's trying he wants you to respect him
[1:07:11] and brother brown said oh how they hated
[1:07:13] him
[1:07:14] oh how they hated him
[1:07:17] miriam disrespected it air and
[1:07:18] disrespected it no matter who you are
[1:07:20] christian or not christian you've got to
[1:07:22] still bring respect to god and respect
[1:07:24] what he's doing or suffer the
[1:07:26] consequence it's either receive it or go
[1:07:29] into judgment either one you want to
[1:07:31] respect what god is doing
[1:07:33] respect what god is doing that means
[1:07:35] respect the deacons that means respect
[1:07:37] the music that means respect the music
[1:07:39] that's playing that means respect the
[1:07:41] ministry and that means respect your
[1:07:43] parents because if your parents are holy
[1:07:45] those field christians and they're
[1:07:47] trying to do what's right for you then
[1:07:48] that means to respect them you know
[1:07:50] that's why the bible in leviticus
[1:07:52] chapter 20 says for everyone that
[1:07:54] curseth his father or his mother shall
[1:07:56] surely be put to death he hath cursed
[1:07:58] his father or his mother his blood shall
[1:08:01] be upon him because there's a
[1:08:02] consequence for disrespecting your
[1:08:04] mother and father when they're trying to
[1:08:06] trying to present the gospel before you
[1:08:08] and you disrespect that you're not
[1:08:10] disrespecting just your mother and
[1:08:12] father but the office of the holy ghost
[1:08:14] is within them the holy ghost is within
[1:08:16] them so they pray they present to you
[1:08:18] the right way to live and the right way
[1:08:20] to act in the right way to do and you
[1:08:22] disrespect that the bible says in
[1:08:24] colossians 3 20 children obey your
[1:08:26] parents and all things for this is well
[1:08:28] pleasing unto the lord
[1:08:30] i i think this afternoon maybe we'll
[1:08:31] find out how to how to actually respect
[1:08:33] god
[1:08:34] that if we respect one another we're
[1:08:36] respecting god if we respect our parents
[1:08:39] then we're respecting god here on this
[1:08:41] mother's day uh maybe maybe some of the
[1:08:43] older ones if you look back at the times
[1:08:45] maybe when you we've all got times where
[1:08:47] we disrespected our parents
[1:08:50] surely well we said things that we
[1:08:51] regret
[1:08:52] but now as you get older you look back
[1:08:54] and you remember that your mama and
[1:08:55] daddy were trying to do the best for you
[1:08:57] your mama and daddy were trying they
[1:08:58] were they were doing that maybe you
[1:09:00] remember back when your mom and daddy
[1:09:02] were praying long hours for you and you
[1:09:04] weren't doing right but yet they were
[1:09:06] calling out to god for you
[1:09:08] and god began to work in your life you
[1:09:10] see that kind of that kind of that kind
[1:09:12] of thing that deserves respect
[1:09:15] my mom and daddy will get that'll get
[1:09:17] greyed and bald-headed because they're
[1:09:19] they're they're crying in the midnight
[1:09:21] hours for their children seeing their
[1:09:23] children do things that are wrong and
[1:09:24] making wrong decisions but something
[1:09:26] within their heart is crying out and god
[1:09:28] will answer the cry of a mother and a
[1:09:30] father
[1:09:31] god will answer and every one of your
[1:09:33] children every one of us adults we need
[1:09:34] to respect our parents i honor our
[1:09:37] mother and father
[1:09:40] bill graham said i've seen young people
[1:09:42] sit in the meeting and snicker and laugh
[1:09:43] in a meeting in less than 24 hours be
[1:09:45] crushed into the streets i've seen young
[1:09:48] people sit in a meeting in one year when
[1:09:49] i was in a place and next maybe within
[1:09:51] six months go back to the same place and
[1:09:53] practically every one of them was gone
[1:09:55] or laying stricken somewhere with
[1:09:56] diseases and things that's right you
[1:09:59] have to respect it and just because
[1:10:01] you're young does not exempt you from
[1:10:03] having a choice just because you're
[1:10:05] young or old or whatever your age is
[1:10:06] your stature in life you've got a choice
[1:10:09] you've got the ability to this afternoon
[1:10:11] to respect or disrespect to accept or
[1:10:14] reject to believe or not believe what
[1:10:17] god is saying what god is doing in this
[1:10:19] hour in proverbs chapter 20 it says who
[1:10:22] who so curseth his father or his mother
[1:10:25] his lamp shall be put out in obscured
[1:10:28] darkness his lamp shall be put out if
[1:10:30] you disrespect your mother and your
[1:10:32] father in deuteronomy 21 it said if a
[1:10:34] man have a stubborn and rebellious son
[1:10:36] which will not obey the voice of his
[1:10:38] father or the voice of his mother and
[1:10:39] that when they have chastened him will
[1:10:41] not hearken unto them then shall his
[1:10:42] mother and father lay on him and bring
[1:10:44] him out unto the elders of his city and
[1:10:46] under the gate of his place and they
[1:10:48] shall say unto the elders of his city
[1:10:50] this our son is stubborn and rebellious
[1:10:52] he will not obey our voice he is a
[1:10:55] glutton and a drunkard and all the men
[1:10:57] of his city shall stone him with stones
[1:10:59] that he die
[1:11:00] so shalt thou put evil away from among
[1:11:02] you and all israel shall hear and fear
[1:11:05] now in the new testament i'm not saying
[1:11:06] that we need to go out stoning people
[1:11:08] that's not what we believe but the old
[1:11:10] testament you can look at the old
[1:11:12] testament type and know for surety that
[1:11:14] there is a consequence for disrespecting
[1:11:16] what god is doing there's a consequence
[1:11:18] for disrespecting your parents trying to
[1:11:21] apply the token over your home and
[1:11:23] trying to set a standard of holiness
[1:11:25] over what you watch on the tv and what
[1:11:27] comes out of your mouth and whether you
[1:11:29] drink alcohol or not or go out partying
[1:11:32] smoking cigarettes and smoking pot
[1:11:34] there's a consequence for disrespect
[1:11:38] and that's why we've got to teach our
[1:11:41] children to respect what god is doing
[1:11:45] i i think one of the greatest parables
[1:11:46] in the bible is when elisha when elijah
[1:11:49] followed elijah over and and and kept
[1:11:51] his eye on him until he saw elijah go up
[1:11:53] in the chariot of fire
[1:11:55] and when he came back on his way back he
[1:11:58] was met by all these little children
[1:12:00] all these little children who had been
[1:12:01] taught by their mother and father to be
[1:12:03] disrespectful to say things around
[1:12:06] behind the minister's back and say
[1:12:07] things that well i don't know
[1:12:10] you know i i don't really know if
[1:12:12] elisha's really if elijah really did go
[1:12:14] up in that whirlwind i don't really know
[1:12:16] if if elisha really has what the same
[1:12:19] anointing that elijah elijah did when he
[1:12:21] come back i heard that he he smacked the
[1:12:23] water with us with with the robe but i
[1:12:25] don't know if it really worked or not
[1:12:27] and they began to sow all this
[1:12:28] disrespect in their children until their
[1:12:30] children began to make fun of the man of
[1:12:32] god when he came by and what did what
[1:12:34] was the effect of that disrespect in
[1:12:36] those children's life they died their
[1:12:38] effect was death but why because they
[1:12:41] had been taught by their mother and
[1:12:42] father just disrespect the word of god
[1:12:45] what god was doing now that's why we got
[1:12:48] to respect what god is doing now we've
[1:12:51] got to respect what god is doing in our
[1:12:53] homes we've got to respect what god is
[1:12:56] doing in our church
[1:12:59] wasn't disrespecting the man
[1:13:01] it was disrespecting his message
[1:13:04] he was a successor to elijah
[1:13:06] he had the anointing the spirit of
[1:13:09] elijah was upon him he went right up
[1:13:11] there and done the very same things that
[1:13:13] elijah did and now this very same
[1:13:16] anointing that was on jesus christ is on
[1:13:18] the church the very same anointing
[1:13:20] that's doing the exact same works and
[1:13:23] surely how much more we should respect
[1:13:24] one another if the same works are being
[1:13:26] done in our midst he said they
[1:13:28] disrespected it and they disrespected
[1:13:30] elijah because he believed in elijah
[1:13:32] because the spirit was upon him
[1:13:36] and the people i bet they laughed to one
[1:13:38] another said
[1:13:39] hey
[1:13:40] hey looky they say a bunch of holy
[1:13:42] rollers
[1:13:44] fanatics
[1:13:45] saying that man went to heaven without
[1:13:47] dying
[1:13:48] horses come down
[1:13:50] we don't see any
[1:13:52] we didn't see any evidence of all that
[1:13:54] right
[1:13:56] see those children have been told that
[1:13:57] at home
[1:13:58] and brother said if they've been taught
[1:14:00] reverence and respect they'd have walked
[1:14:01] out there before that prophet of god and
[1:14:03] have asked for prayer for themselves but
[1:14:05] they've been taught to snicker and laugh
[1:14:07] and to make fun
[1:14:08] you got to respect what god is doing
[1:14:11] you remember that story that brother bam
[1:14:13] told that girl that one night she was
[1:14:15] brother brown was preaching away and he
[1:14:17] saw her get up and she started going out
[1:14:18] of the the the building and something
[1:14:21] just moved within him and he started
[1:14:22] calling out he said
[1:14:24] he he pointedly called out that young
[1:14:27] girl that the lord is calling you and he
[1:14:29] called her to come to the altar and
[1:14:30] receive her salvation but something went
[1:14:32] in her just hardened up and and she went
[1:14:34] on out and she said
[1:14:36] she had one that one day she he met her
[1:14:38] and she said
[1:14:40] well brother graham said he said she
[1:14:42] laughed in my face when i called her to
[1:14:43] come to christ
[1:14:44] she happened to be one of the deacon's
[1:14:46] daughters
[1:14:47] and standing at the door that night she
[1:14:48] waited for me when i come out she said i
[1:14:50] want you to know something right now
[1:14:51] don't you never embarrass me like that
[1:14:53] again she was disrespectful to what god
[1:14:56] was doing right now
[1:14:58] he said i said god was calling you and
[1:15:01] she said nonsense i'm young i got plenty
[1:15:03] of time for that
[1:15:05] but my daddy's got enough religion for
[1:15:07] all of us at home
[1:15:09] my daddy's got enough religion for all
[1:15:11] of us at home
[1:15:12] i'm young
[1:15:13] you ain't never too young to accept
[1:15:15] jesus when he's calling you if you feel
[1:15:17] impulse setting in your heart this
[1:15:18] afternoon it's time to respond don't put
[1:15:21] it off don't disrespect the call of god
[1:15:24] he said she said my daddy's got enough
[1:15:26] religion for all of us at home but your
[1:15:28] daddy ain't got enough religion for you
[1:15:30] you need it for your own self you've got
[1:15:32] to have your own experience you've got
[1:15:34] to have your own token because you can't
[1:15:36] go in on your mama and daddy's coattails
[1:15:39] or on your ministers coattails or on
[1:15:40] brother branham's coattails you've got
[1:15:42] to have your own experience
[1:15:44] and but that's what brother brown said
[1:15:45] he said not enough for you sister
[1:15:47] everyone has to have their own religion
[1:15:48] and she said if i want anybody to talk
[1:15:50] to me about that i'll get somebody
[1:15:52] that's got some sense
[1:15:53] not somebody like you
[1:15:56] somebody that's got some sense i said go
[1:15:58] say what you wish to it won't bother me
[1:16:00] it don't bother me but someday you'll
[1:16:02] regret it
[1:16:03] the next time he saw her she said i
[1:16:05] could see my mother's soul
[1:16:07] fry in hell like a pancake her heart had
[1:16:11] gotten so hard that she said i don't i
[1:16:14] don't even care anymore
[1:16:16] you see that's a dangerous place don't
[1:16:18] even care anymore if there's an ounce of
[1:16:21] care in you tonight i i want to say that
[1:16:23] there's hope you have not gone too far
[1:16:25] there's an house of care if you if
[1:16:27] you're trying to run back to god it
[1:16:29] ain't too late if you're trying to get
[1:16:31] make things right then there's still
[1:16:33] grace for you
[1:16:35] he said when she came back with her
[1:16:37] underskirts hanging down slopping with a
[1:16:39] cigarette in her hand and offered me a
[1:16:40] drink of whiskey and that's how he met
[1:16:42] her again that's that's the fate that
[1:16:45] god is trying to save us when he when he
[1:16:47] calls you when he's calling you see when
[1:16:49] you don't respect what god is doing
[1:16:53] there are consequences
[1:16:55] but when you do respect
[1:16:57] when you do respect what god is doing
[1:16:59] now there's a blessing
[1:17:03] remember that little woman in the bible
[1:17:04] that lived down there and shoot him
[1:17:07] and she saw elijah come through a few
[1:17:09] times and she said you know he started
[1:17:11] she said won't you come in and eat a
[1:17:13] little bit with us and he started coming
[1:17:15] in and she told her husband she said i
[1:17:17] you know this man is a little bit
[1:17:18] different than maybe a lot of the
[1:17:20] denominational teachers that we've heard
[1:17:22] maybe all the other other kind of people
[1:17:24] that say that they talk about religion
[1:17:26] this man is different
[1:17:27] you see he was able to discern that
[1:17:29] there was god moving on the scene i i
[1:17:31] wonder how many of us when we listen to
[1:17:33] sermons out there
[1:17:35] listen to sermons maybe from other
[1:17:36] churches you get can you discern can you
[1:17:39] discern what's true or not i rejoice
[1:17:41] when i listen to somebody preaching the
[1:17:43] truth preaching from a revelation i
[1:17:45] believe that's what god wants us to be
[1:17:46] able to do is to be able to tell when
[1:17:48] something is right or wrong and instead
[1:17:51] of disrespecting him like jezebel did
[1:17:53] she respected that man of god and she
[1:17:54] said you know what we're going to do
[1:17:56] we're going to build a little room for
[1:17:57] him and we're going to set a table over
[1:17:59] there we're going to put a candle on it
[1:18:00] we're going to have a little stool in
[1:18:01] there and whenever he comes by he's
[1:18:03] going to have a place to see it and the
[1:18:04] next time elijah come by he he went into
[1:18:06] that she she pulled him on and showed
[1:18:08] him what they had made they got the
[1:18:10] contractor out built it all up and
[1:18:12] elijah went in there and found that he
[1:18:14] had a place to rest he found out that
[1:18:16] this little woman respected him in a way
[1:18:18] that a lot of other people didn't this
[1:18:20] was real respect this was a real she
[1:18:22] might have been rich but that didn't
[1:18:24] matter
[1:18:26] she respected him
[1:18:29] and he said what can we do for this
[1:18:30] woman
[1:18:31] and he called her and she said she
[1:18:33] didn't ask for nothing she just said
[1:18:34] well we know we live with all our own
[1:18:36] people we got our own we're happy we're
[1:18:38] satisfied and he began to talk to gehazi
[1:18:41] and he said you know she doesn't have a
[1:18:42] child
[1:18:43] and so he told her about the time of
[1:18:45] life this this season next year you
[1:18:47] you're going to have a child even though
[1:18:49] you're old it don't matter whether
[1:18:50] you're old it don't matter whether all
[1:18:52] the doctors have told you it's
[1:18:53] impossible
[1:18:54] but but see she had a blessing because
[1:18:56] she received a blessing because she
[1:18:58] respected what god was doing in her
[1:19:00] house
[1:19:01] she respected god and
[1:19:03] when that little child got it got older
[1:19:05] it was out in the field working and a
[1:19:06] headache come on and they had had a
[1:19:08] little stroke i had a heat stroke out
[1:19:09] there working and it fell over and died
[1:19:11] and she she she knew that god she knew
[1:19:15] who she had met that this man had a
[1:19:17] connection with god and she had a
[1:19:18] respect for that man so she went chasing
[1:19:21] after him and he he came he came back to
[1:19:23] the house she weighed on you know the
[1:19:24] the story i'm not gonna draw it out
[1:19:26] and and and he after he died in his
[1:19:29] mother's arms
[1:19:30] and and he's and he laid his self over
[1:19:32] on that child and and the child came
[1:19:34] back to life and sneezed why because
[1:19:37] sneezed seven times why because she had
[1:19:39] respect to the man of god
[1:19:41] and brother said because of a reverent
[1:19:43] woman
[1:19:44] because of a reverent woman
[1:19:47] like you can have a little sister hattie
[1:19:49] somebody that looks like donald mountain
[1:19:51] and nothing's living in a little shack
[1:19:52] in the mountains that her husband died
[1:19:54] because a tractor fell over on him and
[1:19:56] somebody that looks the whole world
[1:19:58] doesn't doesn't look on with any kind of
[1:20:00] respect but yet god will respect
[1:20:01] somebody that respects him because of a
[1:20:05] woman or woman that respected him a man
[1:20:06] that respected him and believed him but
[1:20:08] be a man of god because she respected
[1:20:11] the man of god
[1:20:12] god demands respect
[1:20:15] and you think about martha the respect
[1:20:17] that she gave jesus when when jesus come
[1:20:19] walking in after lazarus was already in
[1:20:21] the grave he came walking in it looked
[1:20:23] like three days late and she didn't run
[1:20:25] up to him and say well i don't
[1:20:26] understand why i don't understand this
[1:20:28] and that and you should have been here
[1:20:29] and scolding him all that
[1:20:33] she came with respect
[1:20:35] she came with reverence
[1:20:37] you know you know everybody wants to
[1:20:38] make a big deal out of mary because mary
[1:20:40] you know the bible says that mary she
[1:20:42] wanted to sit at jesus feet and hear the
[1:20:43] hear the word and martha was always the
[1:20:45] one in the kitchen cooking and trying to
[1:20:47] keep things clean and worrying about
[1:20:49] whether there was crumbs on the table or
[1:20:50] not and trying to trying to trying to
[1:20:52] tidy up the place while mary was sitting
[1:20:54] in there but brother around said mary
[1:20:56] had a part
[1:20:57] it come time for her she she had a time
[1:21:00] to to stand and show her respect and you
[1:21:02] know every one of us have a time where
[1:21:04] it comes time for us to stand and show
[1:21:06] our respect for god
[1:21:08] mary wanted to hear the word of god so
[1:21:10] she just sat around and listened at him
[1:21:11] she didn't care whether the pillow cases
[1:21:13] was changed whether the curtains was
[1:21:14] dusted but martha always wanted to cook
[1:21:16] him a good dinner but she wanted him to
[1:21:19] do something for jesus in her way and
[1:21:21] mary wanted to do it in her way
[1:21:24] so when jesus came walking up three days
[1:21:26] late and she didn't come running at him
[1:21:28] telling him scolding him and saying well
[1:21:29] i don't understand this and i don't
[1:21:30] understand that but what did she do she
[1:21:32] ran right straight with where he was
[1:21:35] fell down at his feet and said lord if
[1:21:37] thou would have been here my brother
[1:21:39] would not have died
[1:21:40] because she respected the presence of
[1:21:43] god in her miss
[1:21:45] he said oh there you are what was she
[1:21:47] doing she was respected she was in the
[1:21:49] presence of god and she respected him
[1:21:53] what if we could say that to someone
[1:21:54] tonight
[1:21:56] that we respect lord of thou would have
[1:21:58] been here to know to recognize that god
[1:22:00] is in our midst
[1:22:02] the bible says in john chapter 11 then
[1:22:04] marth as soon as she heard that jesus
[1:22:05] was coming went and met him but mary sat
[1:22:07] still in the house and then said martha
[1:22:10] unto jesus lord a thou has been here my
[1:22:11] brother had not died but i know
[1:22:14] but i know that even now
[1:22:16] whatsoever thou wilt ask of god
[1:22:19] god will give it thee
[1:22:22] could we come with respect and this
[1:22:24] afternoon
[1:22:25] knowing respecting that god is in our
[1:22:27] midst
[1:22:29] what if we could say that brother brown
[1:22:30] said what if we could say that to
[1:22:31] someone tonight oh my brother i believe
[1:22:35] that what you ask god god gives it to
[1:22:38] you the same results would come
[1:22:41] in that why the bible says if you've got
[1:22:42] anything wrong with you you come and let
[1:22:44] the elders pray over you and your sins
[1:22:47] will be forgiven you and your oh
[1:22:49] the slate will be wiped clean and you'll
[1:22:51] receive your healing and all those other
[1:22:53] promises why because we're not coming
[1:22:55] here with just a vain gathering but
[1:22:57] we're coming together with respect for
[1:22:59] what god is doing in our midst for
[1:23:02] respect for what god is doing doing now
[1:23:05] he said if she had disrespected it would
[1:23:07] never worked but that was from her heart
[1:23:11] if you can't respect the man respect the
[1:23:13] office he holds in god
[1:23:15] respect the office
[1:23:17] the office of a minister
[1:23:19] the office of a pastor of a deacon
[1:23:21] the office of somebody that's going to
[1:23:23] help you the office of being filled with
[1:23:25] the holy ghost
[1:23:26] that's why jesus said in matthew chapter
[1:23:28] 10 he that receiveth you receiveth me
[1:23:32] and he that receiveth me
[1:23:34] receiveth him that sent me
[1:23:37] so if you receive the word that's coming
[1:23:39] over a pulpit and you believe it and you
[1:23:41] respect it and it says though you
[1:23:43] receive it from god himself
[1:23:45] he that receiveth the prophet in the
[1:23:47] name of a prophet shall receive a
[1:23:49] prophet's reward was a prophet's reward
[1:23:51] you heard the word of a prophet and you
[1:23:54] respected it and now you get a blessing
[1:23:56] from that
[1:23:57] and he that receiveth a righteous man in
[1:23:59] the name of a righteous man shall
[1:24:01] receive a righteous man's reward what's
[1:24:04] a righteous man you can't be righteous
[1:24:06] without the holy ghost that's the only
[1:24:08] way you can be righteous if your mother
[1:24:10] and father are righteous and you respect
[1:24:12] them and you receive what they have for
[1:24:14] you their words of encouragement and
[1:24:16] their words of life that they share with
[1:24:17] you you're receiving it as though it was
[1:24:20] from god himself whosoever shall give
[1:24:22] drink to give to drink unto one of these
[1:24:24] little ones a cup of cold water only in
[1:24:27] the name of a disciple verily i say unto
[1:24:30] you he shall and no wise lose his reward
[1:24:32] why because it's as though you're giving
[1:24:34] a cup of water to god
[1:24:36] if god is tabernacling you and somebody
[1:24:40] gives you a cup of cold water in the
[1:24:42] name of jesus because they respect the
[1:24:45] god that you serve the god that lives in
[1:24:48] you it's the same as they gave that cup
[1:24:51] of water to god
[1:24:56] himself there was a little woman
[1:25:00] that she had a she had a daughter that
[1:25:02] was that was possessed by a devil
[1:25:05] and she came to jesus and she she said
[1:25:07] oh lord thy son of david my daughter is
[1:25:10] grievously vexed with a devil and she
[1:25:12] was calling him son of david but she
[1:25:14] didn't have no right to that title
[1:25:16] because she was a little greek woman she
[1:25:18] she had heard somebody else using that
[1:25:20] title but she didn't know what it meant
[1:25:22] so jesus turned to her and he said he
[1:25:25] said maybe he was thinking i'm going to
[1:25:26] give her a little trial
[1:25:28] i'm going to see
[1:25:29] if she will really respect me
[1:25:32] if she really knows who she's talking to
[1:25:35] and jesus said unto her let the children
[1:25:37] first be filled for it is not meat to
[1:25:38] take the children's bread and to cast it
[1:25:40] under the dogs
[1:25:42] i wonder sometimes you know maybe maybe
[1:25:44] sometimes in your christian journey you
[1:25:45] can look back and remember maybe when a
[1:25:47] minister said something a little bit
[1:25:48] harsh to you maybe somebody said
[1:25:50] something harsh to you and what will we
[1:25:52] do it look back along the road of life
[1:25:55] but so many people who were offended
[1:25:58] at something somebody said and they went
[1:26:00] off
[1:26:01] and went went away because they could
[1:26:03] not they they they could not respect
[1:26:05] what god was doing now
[1:26:09] sometimes we got to look past all the
[1:26:11] little things all the little afflictions
[1:26:12] all the things that people are saying
[1:26:14] because it's for our good it's god
[1:26:16] working god doing something in our midst
[1:26:18] and she answered and said unto him yes
[1:26:20] lord yet the dogs under the table eat of
[1:26:23] the children's crumbs and he said unto
[1:26:25] her for this saying go thy way the devil
[1:26:27] has gone out of that daughter why
[1:26:29] because she believed it
[1:26:30] she respected it
[1:26:32] if god would answer his prayer for
[1:26:34] others she thought he'd answered prayer
[1:26:35] for her and she'd know that he was what
[1:26:37] he said was the word of god if it was
[1:26:39] the word of god for the jews it was the
[1:26:41] word of god for the gentiles too
[1:26:43] whatever he said
[1:26:44] that's how she was coming with respect
[1:26:47] with faith believing
[1:26:50] and brother brown said that caught him
[1:26:51] real quick when she said yeah but
[1:26:53] even the dogs
[1:26:55] even if i'm a dog
[1:26:57] give me a little bit of crumbs
[1:26:59] even if you can come with with that kind
[1:27:01] of fervency and that kind of maybe that
[1:27:03] kind of despair
[1:27:05] that kind of sincerity
[1:27:07] she was respecting god
[1:27:10] as she respected him
[1:27:12] and we respect god as we respect one
[1:27:14] another
[1:27:16] can we respect one another
[1:27:18] that's why the bible says in leviticus
[1:27:20] chapter 19
[1:27:21] thou shalt rise up before the horror
[1:27:23] head the gray head the gray-headed man
[1:27:26] and on to the face of the old man
[1:27:28] and fear thy god i am the lord
[1:27:30] you see an old man in the church that's
[1:27:32] lived a long life and maybe made a lot
[1:27:35] of sacrifices there do you respect
[1:27:38] maybe maybe people might have hurt you
[1:27:39] in the past or done things maybe that
[1:27:41] that maybe you remember wrongly but it
[1:27:43] don't matter matter because the bible
[1:27:45] says that you shall rise up before the
[1:27:47] holy head you give honor to those that
[1:27:50] have lived life before us that that have
[1:27:52] paved the way for us and and lived life
[1:27:54] and done things to make our lives a
[1:27:56] little bit easier that's why first peter
[1:27:58] 5 5 says likewise you younger submit
[1:28:00] yourselves unto the elder that means
[1:28:02] that means when an elder is walking by
[1:28:04] you you you greet them and you apply to
[1:28:06] them and maybe you open the door for
[1:28:08] them and and you do nice to them you
[1:28:09] don't turn your back on them submit
[1:28:11] yourselves unto the elder yea all of you
[1:28:14] be subject one to another and be clothed
[1:28:16] with humility which means nobody's
[1:28:19] bigger than the other
[1:28:21] we're all we're all that's what a
[1:28:22] minister is as a servant so the minister
[1:28:25] is really the least of all the ministers
[1:28:26] the one that should be opening the doors
[1:28:28] and and washing the feet that's why
[1:28:30] jesus was the first one to wash the feet
[1:28:32] of the disciples for god resisted the
[1:28:34] proud and giveth grace to the humble in
[1:28:37] exodus chapter 20 it says honor thy
[1:28:39] father and thy mother that thy days may
[1:28:41] be long upon the land which the lord thy
[1:28:44] god giveth thee
[1:28:45] so if you honor your father and your
[1:28:47] mother
[1:28:48] and you respect your father and your
[1:28:49] mother there's a promise in god's word
[1:28:51] that he will let you live a long life if
[1:28:54] you honor your father and your mother
[1:28:57] and respect them to not rile back when
[1:28:59] they when they're trying to do right and
[1:29:01] trying to set an example in ephesians
[1:29:03] chapter six children obey your parents
[1:29:05] in the lord
[1:29:06] for this is right
[1:29:08] it's right to obey your parents in the
[1:29:10] lord
[1:29:12] and now we've got all those examples
[1:29:14] that we can look in in the old testament
[1:29:16] and all those scriptures and all those
[1:29:17] examples but
[1:29:18] but what about today
[1:29:20] what is god doing now
[1:29:22] and i'll be closing here in just a
[1:29:24] moment
[1:29:25] we got all those examples for long ago
[1:29:28] but we've got an example here in joel
[1:29:30] chapter 1 25 that says i will restore to
[1:29:32] you the years that the locusts have
[1:29:34] eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar
[1:29:36] and the palm worm my great army which i
[1:29:38] sent among you
[1:29:39] we've got a promise that's what god is
[1:29:41] doing now that god by the preaching of
[1:29:43] the gospel by this message that we have
[1:29:45] heard that we respect is restoring
[1:29:48] everything that was lost down through
[1:29:50] the seven church ages i will restore to
[1:29:52] you the years that the locusts have
[1:29:54] eaten
[1:29:55] and joel chapter 2 verse 28 says and it
[1:29:57] shall come to pass afterward that i will
[1:29:59] pour out my spirit upon all flesh and
[1:30:02] your sons and your daughters shall
[1:30:03] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[1:30:06] your young men shall see visions
[1:30:08] we've got a promise
[1:30:10] that in the that that that god will pour
[1:30:13] out his spirit upon all flesh
[1:30:15] we've got a promise now
[1:30:17] you know go back into the old testament
[1:30:19] and look about how when when david was
[1:30:21] anointed by by uh
[1:30:24] samuel
[1:30:25] that he was anointed and he went on
[1:30:28] then he was anointed by the tribe of
[1:30:29] judah
[1:30:31] and then he was anointed by all the
[1:30:32] tribe of israel all the king and he
[1:30:34] became king of all israel
[1:30:37] he was looking for that he got anointed
[1:30:39] by samuel but he was looking for that
[1:30:41] anointing
[1:30:42] he was looking for an anointing to come
[1:30:44] to put him into position
[1:30:46] that's what the bible says in malachi 4
[1:30:48] 5 6 i will send you elijah the prophet
[1:30:50] before the coming of the great and
[1:30:52] dreadful day of the lord and he shall
[1:30:53] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[1:30:56] children in the heart of the children to
[1:30:58] their fathers he'll rotate our hearts
[1:31:01] back to the original faith
[1:31:04] and you see that's what god is doing now
[1:31:06] that's why we have a respect for this
[1:31:08] message
[1:31:09] that's why we come to church with
[1:31:11] reverence knowing that god is doing that
[1:31:15] now and luke chapter 17 it says the same
[1:31:18] day that light went out of sodom it
[1:31:20] rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:31:22] and destroy them all even thus shall it
[1:31:24] be in the day when the sun when the son
[1:31:26] of man is revealed and that is what god
[1:31:29] is doing now
[1:31:31] as revealing the son of man in
[1:31:33] revelation chapter 10 but in the days of
[1:31:34] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:31:37] shall begin to sound the mystery of god
[1:31:39] should be finished as he had declared
[1:31:41] through his servants the prophets
[1:31:43] that is what god is doing now
[1:31:45] i'm talking about i'm talking about god
[1:31:47] is going to anoint a church
[1:31:50] god is going to anoint a church with the
[1:31:52] same anointing that brother branham was
[1:31:54] anointed with the same anointing that
[1:31:57] jesus christ was anointed with because
[1:31:59] it will be the godhead bodily again back
[1:32:02] in flesh manifested in the body of the
[1:32:04] bride do you know that story was typed
[1:32:07] out in the book of acts when the on the
[1:32:08] day of pentecost in acts chapter 2 the
[1:32:11] they received power from god as when
[1:32:13] they were filled with the holy ghost and
[1:32:15] they went out doing all sorts of things
[1:32:17] and they went out testifying and and and
[1:32:19] healing the sick but then on in acts
[1:32:21] chapter four
[1:32:23] they got a
[1:32:24] refilling in acts chapter 4 after after
[1:32:28] a while of going and preaching the
[1:32:29] gospel and
[1:32:31] and healing that lame man at the gate
[1:32:32] beautiful and and and testifying in
[1:32:34] front of all the pharisees they got they
[1:32:36] got a refilling they got to place in
[1:32:39] acts chapter 4 it says in verse 24 they
[1:32:41] lifted up their voice to god
[1:32:43] with one accord
[1:32:45] and what's going to make you in one
[1:32:46] accord it's not our own pity ideas and
[1:32:49] our own thoughts about what's wrong or
[1:32:51] right in church and who's doing this or
[1:32:53] that but what's going to make you in one
[1:32:55] accord is the word of god coming in your
[1:32:58] life precept upon precept lying upon the
[1:33:00] line here a little there little to bring
[1:33:03] you into a place where you're thinking
[1:33:05] just like god thinks
[1:33:07] and they got to a place where they were
[1:33:08] in one accord and said lord thou art god
[1:33:11] which had made heaven and earth and the
[1:33:13] sea and all that and then this and when
[1:33:15] they had prayed you can go read it for
[1:33:16] yourself in acts chapter four and they
[1:33:18] began to pray and
[1:33:20] i believe they were coming to a place
[1:33:21] where they knew that they needed what
[1:33:23] they needed was a true token
[1:33:26] and i'm not saying i'm not saying
[1:33:28] let
[1:33:29] us follow the line of thinking now
[1:33:31] when they had prayed the place was
[1:33:33] shaken where they were assembled
[1:33:34] together and they were all filled with
[1:33:37] the holy ghost and they spake the word
[1:33:40] of god with boldness they come out of
[1:33:42] there with a refilling and what we need
[1:33:45] in this hour i believe what's happening
[1:33:47] right now is god is on the scene to give
[1:33:50] us a capstone feeling to give us a
[1:33:52] special anointing of the baptism of the
[1:33:54] holy ghost upon the word that we have
[1:33:57] been packing in just like when solomon
[1:33:59] made that temple and he put the word he
[1:34:02] was waiting for that ark of the covenant
[1:34:03] to move in and when the ark of the
[1:34:05] covenant slid into that into his place
[1:34:08] then the shekinah glory came down upon
[1:34:10] that temple and it filled that place
[1:34:13] the place was shaken there in acts
[1:34:15] chapter 4 the place was shaken where
[1:34:17] they were assembled together and they
[1:34:18] were all filled with the holy ghost and
[1:34:20] they spake the word of god with boldness
[1:34:23] and the multitude of them that believed
[1:34:25] were of one heart and of one soul
[1:34:27] neither said any of them that all the
[1:34:29] things which he possessed was his own
[1:34:31] but they had all things caught in common
[1:34:34] they were they got to a place where they
[1:34:36] were so filled that they didn't care
[1:34:37] about who had more money they didn't
[1:34:40] care about who had property you can have
[1:34:42] it i'll help you i'll help you with your
[1:34:44] doctor bills i'll help you out with
[1:34:46] whatever you need because what had
[1:34:48] happened was the holy ghost that had
[1:34:50] failed on the day of pentecost had been
[1:34:52] rekindled in their life
[1:34:54] you see what's taking place now in the
[1:34:56] church of the living god is the holy
[1:34:58] ghost is in our midst to rekindle what
[1:35:00] we had or to rekindle our first love the
[1:35:03] holy ghost is moving in our life if we
[1:35:05] can respect what god is doing he's on
[1:35:08] the scene now in a special anointing
[1:35:11] he's here brother and said in divine
[1:35:13] healing he said oh it's such a marvelous
[1:35:15] thing to read this new testament old
[1:35:18] testament any of it but the fourth
[1:35:20] chapter of acts this morning where we
[1:35:22] start for a little preview now we're
[1:35:24] going back
[1:35:25] this is during the time that the church
[1:35:27] had just been rekindled and what's going
[1:35:30] to rekindle the church is when the fire
[1:35:32] of the living god comes up onto a people
[1:35:35] that have been packing that word in
[1:35:37] until because it's adoption time
[1:35:40] adoption time with a special anointing
[1:35:44] you know when on the day of pentecost
[1:35:46] peter came out and he began to declare
[1:35:48] that this is that
[1:35:49] he began to declare that god is feeling
[1:35:51] the church he began to declare that he
[1:35:54] began to identify what was taking place
[1:35:55] with the book of joel he began to
[1:35:57] declare all these things but i believe
[1:35:59] that brother brahma's message came to
[1:36:01] declare that this is that the thing that
[1:36:02] we've been looking for
[1:36:04] this is that that god is filling this
[1:36:06] church this is that that god is filling
[1:36:09] his church with adoption power this is
[1:36:11] that that god is capping off his church
[1:36:14] this is that that god is manifesting
[1:36:16] himself in fullness and that's what he's
[1:36:18] doing now
[1:36:19] if we can respect what god is doing now
[1:36:22] god will give us a blessing to realize
[1:36:24] that god is on the scene now to fulfill
[1:36:26] his word
[1:36:28] brother i said all those great respects
[1:36:30] and so forth
[1:36:31] all those great respects back then
[1:36:34] but today somehow
[1:36:35] it's different
[1:36:37] today somehow it's different god can do
[1:36:39] something today and people will laugh at
[1:36:40] it
[1:36:42] i believe that we've been different
[1:36:43] today
[1:36:44] he said about 40 years ago when the holy
[1:36:46] ghost first began to fall with the
[1:36:47] people who locked up the preachers
[1:36:49] called them holy rollers went out on the
[1:36:51] wouldn't even feed them in the cities
[1:36:52] and everything like that
[1:36:54] they broke corn on the railroad tracks
[1:36:55] to live by what did they do they had
[1:36:57] another 40 years the church has
[1:36:58] suffering went through everything two
[1:37:00] wars in that time a lot of time a lot of
[1:37:03] work a lot of a lot of effort but
[1:37:05] there's a time that's that i believe god
[1:37:07] is moving in his church now to rekindle
[1:37:10] and joel chapter 2 it says be glad then
[1:37:12] you children of zion and rejoice in the
[1:37:14] lord your god for he hath given you the
[1:37:16] former rain moderately
[1:37:18] and he will cause to come down for you
[1:37:20] the rain the former rain and the latter
[1:37:21] rain
[1:37:22] in the first month
[1:37:24] the latter rain the latter rain is when
[1:37:26] it's harvest time
[1:37:28] the latter rain
[1:37:29] it's been growing up and now the
[1:37:31] laddering comes to anoint you to anoint
[1:37:33] you into doing something for christ
[1:37:35] anoint you to to
[1:37:36] to anoint you to where god really wants
[1:37:39] you to be positionally placed
[1:37:41] and brotherhood said now what would take
[1:37:42] place when god gods begin to pour out
[1:37:45] the holy ghost upon the church in the
[1:37:47] last days
[1:37:49] what would take place when god begins to
[1:37:51] pour out his holy holy spirit in the
[1:37:52] church in the last days
[1:37:54] and he said back then they said it's
[1:37:56] hudu is hypnotism is a mental flip
[1:37:58] telepathist it's that this that or the
[1:38:00] other why because they did not realize
[1:38:02] what god was doing and they did not
[1:38:05] respect what god was doing god wants to
[1:38:08] anoint a church and to cap a church off
[1:38:14] that's why you got to have a revelation
[1:38:16] of the son of man to take a rapture
[1:38:18] because the right without a revelation
[1:38:20] of the son of man you won't realize that
[1:38:22] you're an invincible army when the bride
[1:38:25] begins to realize who she is
[1:38:27] and what she's here for she will be an
[1:38:30] invincible army and who are you
[1:38:33] you are the son of man you are god back
[1:38:36] in flesh but you can't just be educated
[1:38:38] into it god's got to speak it to your
[1:38:40] heart you've got to hear the voice of
[1:38:42] god speaking to you so that you know it
[1:38:44] for yourself
[1:38:47] when the bride begins to realize who she
[1:38:49] is and there's your answer laying it for
[1:38:51] you in black and white who are you you
[1:38:53] are the son of man
[1:38:55] you've got to respect what god is doing
[1:38:58] in proverbs chapter 13 of wise son
[1:39:01] heareth his father's instruction
[1:39:05] a wise son is somebody to sit and listen
[1:39:07] to his father
[1:39:08] have we sat and listened to our father i
[1:39:10] believe i believe that many can say that
[1:39:12] we have
[1:39:14] but a scorner heareth not rebuke
[1:39:17] a scorner could come and just sit there
[1:39:19] and with a scowl on their face laughing
[1:39:21] and everything and and not get any kind
[1:39:23] of blessing
[1:39:24] all they'll get is it all they'll get is
[1:39:26] curses
[1:39:27] and proverbs chapter 19 verse 20 here
[1:39:29] counsel and receive instruction that
[1:39:32] they might doubt that that thou mayest
[1:39:34] be wise
[1:39:35] and thou ladder in
[1:39:37] and that's what we want isn't it a good
[1:39:39] ladder in
[1:39:40] we want our ladder in
[1:39:42] to be correct
[1:39:44] and our ladder in
[1:39:46] is to be so wound up in christ until we
[1:39:48] are in full oneness with christ
[1:39:50] that god is so manifested in us until
[1:39:52] he's walking in our members and we're
[1:39:54] thinking like he does and talking like
[1:39:56] he is and acting like he is and living a
[1:39:59] life of holiness and not some kind of
[1:40:01] tommy rot like all these fakers out
[1:40:03] there
[1:40:04] living a life a real genuine christian
[1:40:06] life can we respect god enough to be
[1:40:10] concerned do we respect god what god is
[1:40:13] doing now
[1:40:14] to care
[1:40:16] they were disrespected and they called
[1:40:18] them holy rollers the newspapers waited
[1:40:19] to say every slander and dirty thing
[1:40:21] they could and put every dirty slang to
[1:40:23] it they could and things like that and
[1:40:25] churches he hauled and laughed at it and
[1:40:27] made fun of them and turned them away
[1:40:29] and tried to keep them out of the cities
[1:40:31] and everything else with disrespect
[1:40:34] with disrespect
[1:40:37] and brother i made this great statement
[1:40:38] he said believe it
[1:40:40] believe it till it's proved wrong
[1:40:43] now that's a big statement isn't it
[1:40:46] then when it's proved wrong then you
[1:40:47] have a right to disbelieve it that don't
[1:40:49] associate it with no more but as long as
[1:40:51] it's being proven out to be the truth
[1:40:53] then believe it
[1:40:55] this message has been proven out to be
[1:40:57] true
[1:40:57] with signs and wonders and vindication
[1:41:00] and lives changed at testimonies and
[1:41:03] doctor reports
[1:41:04] and and all around the vindication of
[1:41:07] the pillar of fire that we have hanging
[1:41:09] on our walls
[1:41:11] brother said god's begin to pour our
[1:41:13] spirits our gifts upon us we see it now
[1:41:15] what is the gift of god today
[1:41:18] what is the gift of god today
[1:41:20] i believe the gift of god today
[1:41:23] he said it's the holy spirit
[1:41:25] it's the holy ghost in us
[1:41:27] we've got to respect that
[1:41:30] we've got to respect it on every person
[1:41:32] that comes upon
[1:41:33] we've got to respect
[1:41:35] we've got to give respect to god's
[1:41:37] divine gifts as the musicians come
[1:41:39] forward
[1:41:40] when he sends those gifts no matter how
[1:41:42] real they are
[1:41:43] it'll never help us until we get to a
[1:41:45] place
[1:41:47] that we can respect it
[1:41:49] the holy ghost is here
[1:41:51] i'm talking about a holy ghost
[1:41:53] of a special anointing the holy ghost to
[1:41:56] bring adoption time to the church if we
[1:41:59] can respect that trust message to bring
[1:42:01] us to fullness
[1:42:03] respect it when he comes is what brother
[1:42:05] brahm said because god is here to anoint
[1:42:07] the church it's not emotion it's not
[1:42:10] just putting something on but it's the
[1:42:11] manifestation of the word and this hour
[1:42:15] and we've got to respect it
[1:42:18] the conclusion of the whole matter is
[1:42:19] fear god
[1:42:22] fear god and keep his commandments
[1:42:24] and brother abraham said you cannot have
[1:42:25] respect until you have fear you've got
[1:42:28] to have fear
[1:42:29] of god
[1:42:31] and your attitude towards what god is
[1:42:32] doing
[1:42:34] determines the result let's stand our
[1:42:36] feet and just praise him and worship

[1:42:55] challenge you tonight this afternoon
[1:42:57] challenge you to believe god

[1:43:03] that time that he that that that
[1:43:05] minister put that that poison out on the
[1:43:07] pulpit and said if anybody here really
[1:43:08] believes in divine healing let somebody
[1:43:11] come up and drink this and that little
[1:43:12] man that that was brother brown was
[1:43:14] pastor back in the day said i accept
[1:43:16] that challenge
[1:43:17] and he came up and guzzled it down and
