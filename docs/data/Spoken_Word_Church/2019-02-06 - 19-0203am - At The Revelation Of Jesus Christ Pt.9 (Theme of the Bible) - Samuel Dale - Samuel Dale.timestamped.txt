[13:12] Lord if you'd like to turn in your
[13:14] scriptures turn where we've been reading
[13:16] from first Peter 1 and then we'll go to
[13:19] revelations 2 first Peter 1 revelations
[13:23] to remember the announcements that have
[13:26] been made in things the upcoming events
[13:29] and now the fellowship meeting will be
[13:32] the third Saturday in March at brother
[13:36] lung gooris remember
[13:50] to cover the point in getting into the
[13:54] church ages and maybe today we just move
[13:56] in a little bit to see our point in a
[13:59] cover from that you know in the word and
[14:03] seeing because what's been our point
[14:05] we've been talking about how the Bible
[14:07] was written that's our whole goal to see
[14:10] that part and if we can see how the Book
[14:13] of Revelations comes into being then we
[14:16] see how that you know that the whole
[14:19] Bible comes into being and all onto that
[14:22] point so just remember that first Peter
[14:25] 1 and revelations to
[14:28] the heavenly Father we thank you for
[14:31] this day and your love and your grace
[14:32] thank you for all things we just ask you
[14:35] now that you'd come among us in a mighty
[14:37] way and open our understanding to thy
[14:40] word because that's our desire that's
[14:43] the reason for gathering is to see you
[14:46] and to see you in the word and how you
[14:48] manifest yourself and let that then come
[14:51] forth as alive into our hearts and our
[14:55] lives that we may see you father we ask
[14:58] you to be with a sick that's among us
[15:00] just touch each one and let your light
[15:03] be their Lord to deliver them from those
[15:06] things and the problems because we
[15:08] believe your word that by your stripes
[15:09] were healed and we thank you for it have
[15:12] your way now as we read your words you
[15:15] come and speak to our hearts in Jesus
[15:16] name
[15:22] first Peter 1:7
[15:25] that's a trial of your faith being much
[15:28] more precious than of gold that perishes
[15:31] though it be tried with fire might be
[15:34] found unto praise and honor and glory or
[15:37] at the appearing of Jesus Christ right
[15:40] they remember they're peering into
[15:42] coming he's appearing now among his mom
[15:46] his the world in healings and signs and
[15:49] wonders but his coming is in the bride
[15:52] or manifestation to her whom having not
[15:55] seen you love and him though now you see
[15:59] him not yet believing you rejoice with
[16:02] joy unspeakable and full of glory
[16:04] receiving the end of your faith even the
[16:07] salvation of your souls of which
[16:09] salvation the prophets have inquired and
[16:12] searched diligently who prophesied of
[16:15] the grace that should come unto you know
[16:17] it's prophesying of it they did back
[16:20] there searching what or what manner of
[16:23] time the Spirit of Christ which was in
[16:26] them did signify when it testified
[16:29] beforehand the sufferings of Christ and
[16:32] the glory that should follow
[16:34] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[16:37] themselves and that was made known to
[16:38] them you know but they couldn't see the
[16:41] end of it
[16:43] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[16:47] themselves but unto us they did minister
[16:50] the things which are now reported unto
[16:52] you by them that have preached the
[16:55] gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost
[16:57] senior disciples already at this time
[16:59] we're out preaching of what the Old
[17:02] Testament spoke of and to bring into
[17:04] manifestation
[17:06] sit down from heaven which things the
[17:08] angels desire to look into wherefore
[17:10] gird up the loins of your mind be sober
[17:12] and hope to the end for the grace that
[17:15] is to be brought unto you at the
[17:18] revelation of Jesus Christ let's just
[17:21] stop there and we'll continue this on
[17:23] You Father we thank you and we ask you
[17:25] now to just bless us bless your word
[17:28] we committed all into your hands God in
[17:31] Jesus name Amen
[17:32] you may be seated
[17:35] cuz we're gonna get to
[17:37] revelations 2 anyway
[17:39] [Applause]
[17:48] and as I will say it now what's our
[17:50] point what does it been we've been
[17:52] talking about
[17:54] the writing or the bringing forth of the
[17:57] Bible now brother Branham says
[18:01] that Christ mister God revealed that
[18:05] Jesus Christ is the central theme of the
[18:08] entire Bible all right so what we're
[18:12] going to be dealing with today is the
[18:15] point of the theme of the Bible
[18:20] okay too far okay got it
[18:23] see the the theme of the Bible the theme
[18:28] a theme is like a you know something
[18:31] you're doing like a composition your
[18:33] writing or our
[18:36] subject that you're trying to bring
[18:38] forth and and to to do and really it
[18:42] comes into a point of talking like
[18:47] taken from the word composition because
[18:50] that's really what a theme is and a
[18:53] composition is like many things
[18:57] brought together
[19:00] to form one point the you're making a
[19:05] composition of something it means a lot
[19:08] of things brought together and see
[19:10] that's what the Bible is it's God's plan
[19:14] and purpose of salvation and it's of
[19:17] bringing together all of those things
[19:20] which would be a thing here in this part
[19:22] here see the Old Testament had their
[19:24] part all right see then the New
[19:27] Testament started brot it's part you
[19:30] know the Lord Jesus walking on earth
[19:31] then you know come on in to the book of
[19:34] Acts and then now talking in the church
[19:36] ages so then it's it's forming a
[19:40] written word
[19:42] are a
[19:43] manifested a live word because that's
[19:46] the point see the word has always been
[19:49] alive it's mankind the one that didn't
[19:51] have it in the line of the light the
[19:53] word itself is alive in art but now get
[19:57] that get that statement and keep it that
[20:00] it's many things a
[20:03] composition is many things that is
[20:07] finally brought together each one is
[20:10] speaking off finally pointing to one
[20:13] thing all right so now no matter where
[20:16] you would read in the Bible all right
[20:20] when you read in the Bible the Prophet
[20:22] said if you don't see Christ in every
[20:25] verse he said go back and read it again
[20:27] he said cause you missed him all right
[20:30] see then that's many things many
[20:33] manifestations that he's had like
[20:36] reading that of the the Peter there that
[20:39] those Old Testament prophets they knew
[20:41] something was going on but they couldn't
[20:45] see totally down to the end of it but
[20:48] they knew that they were were involved
[20:51] in something and but they were waiting
[20:54] for a time to see it and they they never
[20:57] did see it coming to reality
[20:59] see because finally Jesus Christ did
[21:02] step forth from that but yet the Old
[21:05] Testament part those those prophets and
[21:07] things were already passed on they
[21:09] couldn't see the end of what they were
[21:13] trying to bring the Peter said we would
[21:16] see the end of our salvation
[21:19] the salvation of our souls right we'd
[21:22] come to the end because that's what's
[21:24] been spoken in other words tied all
[21:26] together and what I'm saying everything
[21:28] you studying the word to see Christ and
[21:32] you're coming down and you're you're
[21:34] bringing it to a a collection or a topic
[21:37] because that's another word for thing is
[21:41] like a topic and you're bringing it down
[21:43] to that and everything in our will speak
[21:46] of Jesus Christ all right and see
[21:49] because he's the theme of the entire
[21:51] Bible
[21:53] hey now in following that then we can
[21:56] come to fourth because my point has been
[22:01] we may read in the Old Testament and see
[22:04] the writings and see the things and try
[22:06] to bring that together but when you come
[22:09] to the Book of Revelations you're coming
[22:12] to something that you're not necessarily
[22:15] writing the now it'll be in there so
[22:19] just hold a point but you're not Nestor
[22:21] buckle Revelation is not necessarily
[22:23] writing the past
[22:24] the Book of Revelations I've tried to
[22:27] emphasize the Book of Revelations is the
[22:30] alive word
[22:31] now remember what we're saying John
[22:35] wrote
[22:38] after Paul died which that don't change
[22:42] anything
[22:44] because in the days of Paul the Word was
[22:48] alive
[22:49] when you enter the New Testament
[22:51] remember you're no longer prophesying
[22:56] right you're coming to a reality of the
[23:02] Living Word you're not trying to
[23:04] prophesy of it or show it
[23:07] alright then see it can speak of future
[23:10] things but not not necessarily see
[23:13] that's where the Prophet said it you
[23:15] know on the message search we would see
[23:17] Jesus that is quoting the other day they
[23:19] see that people find the greatest he
[23:23] said the greatest hindrance is people
[23:26] try to build
[23:29] something in the past
[23:33] or something well over in the future and
[23:37] said you're missing it and it's so high
[23:40] that no one can reach it
[23:45] quoting what he says from the sir he
[23:47] said it's so high nobody can reach that
[23:50] what because you've had it in the pies
[23:52] are you putting it in the future now
[23:55] listen to words what he said
[23:57] now that's just the devil doing that
[24:02] so the devil is trying to keep you
[24:04] confused so he builds opponent and talks
[24:08] of the past and he'll talk of the future
[24:11] but he doesn't want you to think about
[24:13] anything present tense
[24:15] all right now may I say this with the
[24:20] doubts in our mind the new birth cannot
[24:23] be a heist hence
[24:26] the new birth cannot be a future tense
[24:30] the new birth is a present tense
[24:34] something happening right now now
[24:37] there's more to go in the new birth
[24:39] right more growth developments all that
[24:41] right wonderful but just remember the
[24:44] new birth
[24:45] the new birth is present tense
[24:48] alright and see brother branham I like
[24:52] this one too words he's talking about
[24:54] the I am
[24:56] he said now from the message look away
[25:00] to Jesus he said when Moses draw close
[25:04] to it to take off your shoes for I am
[25:08] now if you would weigh that word I am
[25:13] it's
[25:15] past tense present
[25:20] tense and future tense
[25:26] I
[25:28] am eternal okay now
[25:34] remember what he said to Moses just to
[25:37] give a little show of what we're
[25:39] thinking about
[25:41] when he said to Moses he said Moses said
[25:44] I'm not going unless you tell me who who
[25:46] you are said you've told me that you're
[25:47] the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob or
[25:50] maybe Joseph is earth God which way it
[25:51] goes but anything he says Moses said I
[25:55] know them
[25:57] I've heard it about it you've talked to
[26:00] me about it along the way and in my
[26:01] journey and thanks but said I'm not
[26:04] going to you give me something
[26:08] right
[26:10] now what did he say why did he make that
[26:13] statement
[26:14] cuz I'm wanting you to see a present
[26:16] tense
[26:17] perfect present tense here what you want
[26:20] to say it
[26:21] he said I am
[26:24] that I
[26:26] am
[26:30] no what did he mean I am that I am I
[26:40] am the God of Abraham Isaac Jacob
[26:46] I'm what they spoke of
[26:51] I'm what all of these things and says
[26:54] now Moses you know the story you
[26:58] know where you were born
[27:01] how you was born
[27:03] how your life was
[27:06] said then you come down to the point of
[27:09] trying to do what you could do
[27:13] and said
[27:15] you didn't make it
[27:18] but he said I want you to know now
[27:20] listen to the point I am that I am I
[27:24] am that
[27:29] that brought forth you as a child I am
[27:34] that that tried to tell you you as a
[27:37] leader and to do what was right I am
[27:39] that I
[27:41] am
[27:43] it's not double statement of eternity
[27:46] because there's no need of double Staton
[27:47] eternity I am is enough that's eternal
[27:50] but he said I am everything that spoke
[27:54] of anything in your life are your
[27:57] thoughts or anything you say I know of
[28:00] Abraham Isaac and Jacob I
[28:03] am that
[28:05] one that spoke through Abraham Isaac
[28:08] Jacob Joseph I'm all of that from
[28:12] telling you if you just listen Moses
[28:17] everything that's ever been before
[28:20] I'm it
[28:22] I'm that
[28:25] so I'm that I am
[28:29] let's think about that the other day I
[28:31] said I don't think we really see that we
[28:33] don't see the way would double state he
[28:35] said I am that I am
[28:40] if he's referring you can just say well
[28:43] he's that I am he you know he's that
[28:44] that's fine but that doesn't get enough
[28:46] to me because if he's putting it all on
[28:48] Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph all of the
[28:52] patriarchs as Peter says it's written
[28:54] about it and all of them speaking about
[28:57] it and all of them coming forth
[29:00] in other words he's saying to Moses look
[29:04] I
[29:06] sent you to Egypt
[29:10] I've sent you to Egypt I brought you out
[29:13] of Egypt I'm that I am
[29:16] because remember we get to story wrong
[29:19] Israel never went to Egypt now listen
[29:23] Israel never went to Egypt in bondage
[29:28] they went to Egypt as conquerors that
[29:32] the ruler gave him the best land gave
[29:36] him Goshen gave him all of those things
[29:38] it probably took a couple of 200-300
[29:41] years that they were in Egypt before
[29:44] they become slaves
[29:47] to remember he sent them to Egypt for
[29:50] another reason he didn't sound age of
[29:52] his slaves that going into Egypt get the
[29:56] point a lot of times Israel sinned and
[29:59] God sent them into countries as
[30:01] punishment but he never sent the
[30:04] children of Israel to Egypt as
[30:07] punishment
[30:10] that was not it
[30:13] it was to the point that they were to go
[30:16] down there and be
[30:18] the leaders and
[30:21] had they stayed with it they would have
[30:23] but they wouldn't stay with it maybe 100
[30:27] 200 300 years somewhere that they were
[30:30] actually there with the Egyptians as
[30:32] side by side leaving off the greatest
[30:35] land that could ever and they had
[30:37] everything they had the Goshen which was
[30:40] the great parts of Egypt the greatest of
[30:42] all and that belonged to them then they
[30:46] become a king that didn't know
[30:49] Joseph right
[30:51] the end they went into bondage in time
[30:54] he get the story so he's saying to Moses
[30:58] Moses I
[31:00] sent you to Egypt are the people god I
[31:03] told him says he's gonna be down there
[31:04] for hundred years I
[31:06] said I am that I am I'm the one that
[31:10] said all these I am the God of Abraham
[31:12] Isaac and Jacob
[31:14] because I am
[31:17] eternal that's who I am
[31:21] he's eternal
[31:23] that's why Jesus Christ then is what the
[31:27] central theme of the entire Bible
[31:32] because who was Moses when he brother on
[31:36] say
[31:38] he said I couldn't understand how Moses
[31:41] could tell better we're doing time he
[31:43] said I found out it was Christ in Moses
[31:46] we see when when Moses left that burning
[31:50] bush he didn't leave the burning bush
[31:52] the bush went with him
[31:57] when he went to Egypt where was the bush
[32:00] not following him as a physical bush but
[32:03] there was the I am why would Pharaoh
[32:05] afraid of Moses
[32:09] my goodness he's King all he had to say
[32:13] cut his head off
[32:16] when he was afraid number one you've
[32:20] heard me speak about it before I believe
[32:22] he that was afraid to the point that he
[32:24] would Moses would cause an insurrection
[32:26] and take over
[32:29] but remember
[32:32] Pharaoh could read
[32:34] the hieroglyphics ever heard of the word
[32:37] for it you know where they wrote of the
[32:40] story and remember it's in the stories
[32:43] of the hieroglyphics that Moses would
[32:45] come forth and be the leader
[32:48] not to name Moses but they would come
[32:52] forth a leader a one to take them out so
[32:56] how far a row I'd be a little afraid of
[32:58] antenna I'd kind of let him just go
[33:00] along and kind of get along with him
[33:03] wouldn't you
[33:04] they hoping maybe he'd get up leave
[33:07] will see God hardened his heart and keep
[33:09] him from in other words he starts out a
[33:11] take a take them know I hear so far and
[33:14] do what you want to hear do what you
[33:15] want to there but just come on back and
[33:16] everything's okay
[33:19] then God got into the heart of a role
[33:22] you know all right get the point so the
[33:26] theme of the entire Bible
[33:28] is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[33:33] alright now when we come to the Book of
[33:37] Revelations and we started our study of
[33:41] the Book of Revelations
[33:43] we started off by the first three verses
[33:47] were he said before I do anything now to
[33:51] you
[33:53] John said before you write anything for
[33:56] in it I want you to know who I am
[34:01] and he said I am that I am I've come now
[34:06] to do what I said I'd do here
[34:09] alright
[34:10] John is writing
[34:14] and you understand what I'm getting out
[34:16] of keep saying it because John is
[34:18] writing the Bible the book of Revelation
[34:21] is a part of the Bible just as well as
[34:23] Genesis Exodus Leviticus numbers
[34:25] Deuteronomy
[34:31] Joshua
[34:46] resin deal now listen it's dire cause
[34:49] you've got to have it in there of who
[34:51] come from water this is area but the
[34:54] book of Revelation is not written about
[34:55] the past
[34:57] you've moved from a pice tense
[35:02] to a present tense
[35:05] but remember as Moses was riding
[35:09] the first five book he was riding in
[35:12] present tense right I mean is that
[35:15] sensible he sat down and he wrote the
[35:17] first five books as he was right that
[35:20] was present tense he may have wrote of
[35:23] the post
[35:24] and then he was ride of his own life and
[35:28] even his own death
[35:31] but then he would write of the future
[35:33] that you know Israel would go out with a
[35:36] mighty hand
[35:38] remember our point now that because
[35:40] that's kind of the life statements I was
[35:42] making a couple of weeks ago when as
[35:44] ministry that the Book of Revelations is
[35:47] not necessarily dealing with the past
[35:51] each point of it is present
[35:55] nobody wrote this yeah there was a lot
[35:59] of things before John went to patmans
[36:01] Paul had already become the first Church
[36:03] a messenger that church age was almost
[36:06] gone
[36:07] by the time but brother Branham said it
[36:10] this away he said they do that you know
[36:14] Paul was that he said but it's not
[36:16] necessarily what we're considering
[36:18] though he said it's the one who was the
[36:20] greatest of all the days
[36:23] this matter Paul was over here
[36:25] Paul's life and teachings is still
[36:30] prevalent today teaching to our hearts
[36:33] and lives right and it's still present
[36:36] tense there's your whole thing of what
[36:39] I've been trying to drive that when you
[36:41] sit down and you read the Bible you read
[36:44] it as a present tense and
[36:47] don't read it into the future tense
[36:50] there are things that will be future
[36:54] but remember the point is what is
[36:57] present
[36:59] and as the Prophet said you stay in the
[37:02] past
[37:04] like Wade was ministering here one day I
[37:07] remember him saying he said let's quit
[37:08] trying to raise up behind it quit trying
[37:11] to raise off Abraham Abraham lived back
[37:13] dark
[37:15] I believe it alive God I
[37:18] believe in an alive manifestation of God
[37:21] I don't care what the world says or the
[37:25] people of this message and how they
[37:26] turned against any got nothing to do
[37:28] with it the it's the alive word but if
[37:33] you'll see that it's alive right now
[37:34] then we're not going to get to the
[37:36] seventh Church age because they've got a
[37:39] point to holding there all right we're
[37:41] going to try to deal in the church ages
[37:44] in relation to try to see
[37:47] now what was our thoughts
[37:50] what was her thoughts of the writing of
[37:53] the Bible
[37:55] God comes down
[37:57] he appears to a prophet
[38:00] he writes the things Moses even the past
[38:05] for 3,000 years he writes it that's fine
[38:10] then he comes to present tense as
[38:14] Moses going to the burning bush
[38:17] that's where you pick up the present
[38:20] tense I'm trying to emphasize that you
[38:23] pick it up as to Moses you know standing
[38:27] before that burning bush and that
[38:29] burning bush says I am that I am
[38:33] now you go tell them that
[38:38] you go down there and you tell the
[38:40] children of Israel because listen he was
[38:43] not necessarily going to tell Pharaoh
[38:47] now get the point and listen his main
[38:51] objective was to go to Israel and get
[38:55] Israel
[38:56] to see who's sinning
[38:59] then they'd believe his message you've
[39:02] given two signs all of that
[39:05] but he was trying to get Israel to see
[39:08] he didn't matter about the Egyptians
[39:11] seeing who was coming down to take over
[39:13] that didn't matter anyway they didn't
[39:15] mount to a thing
[39:18] it was to Israel to get them to realize
[39:22] something was taking place right then
[39:30] the word should be coming alive to you
[39:34] that when you read the Bible
[39:37] it should be coming to the point that
[39:40] that Bible is alive
[39:42] it'll get it'll stop being so bored
[39:45] about reading
[39:48] is one of many mobile reports well I'm
[39:51] honest what about you when I read the
[39:54] Bible the first time I was in a Baptist
[39:56] Church didn't know very much background
[39:57] but a little bit and read well you know
[40:00] when I got over to out of that that
[40:02] sword showed me got sewing sewing sword
[40:04] stroke we got so one so and so it's old
[40:05] we gots one so and on our lighter so I
[40:07] was still so and so and so and so and so
[40:08] and so be getting so enjoy that didn't
[40:10] mean a thing to me
[40:13] right oh
[40:17] you shouldn't have said it
[40:20] because if the word is not allowed to
[40:23] you now are to me it doesn't mean a
[40:26] thing if
[40:29] it's not real right now I doesn't mean a
[40:31] thing
[40:32] now I ain't talking about a god of the
[40:34] future ain't talking about what is going
[40:36] to take place
[40:38] I'm talking about what is taking place
[40:42] that's been my whole goal for months is
[40:45] to drive at a point that we could see
[40:49] the Word of God is alive in the hearts
[40:54] of a born-again believer
[40:55] and if we get that and get that into our
[40:58] doing dinner that you won't read the
[41:00] Bible cause to remember and this this is
[41:03] the point yeah I kind of got bored
[41:06] reading so and so begat so and so
[41:09] now don't tell me you didn't now let's
[41:12] tell you you're lying and we'll forget
[41:14] all of that
[41:16] but all at once right in the middle of
[41:19] that
[41:19] go back and really get into that so and
[41:23] so begat so and so and so and so begat
[41:24] so and so and right in the middle of all
[41:27] that so and so forgot so no there'll be
[41:29] a pearl
[41:31] that will appear in the scripture it
[41:34] will tell something about what's taking
[41:36] place or has taken place or a future
[41:39] point
[41:41] so we might order so and so begat so and
[41:45] so all right go right in the middle of
[41:48] that you'll find an inserted point
[41:51] that's even when you read it you wonder
[41:53] why was it put dire
[41:55] you know but it's true now right
[41:58] okay now so then the point is what not
[42:05] to look back not to look forward those
[42:07] are wonderful things
[42:10] but to see what is taking place right
[42:13] now
[42:14] all right now in reading the church ages
[42:19] I ask you to read those ages and pay
[42:22] close attention to the thoughts and
[42:24] things that were said I'm not asking for
[42:27] a raise of hands I just ask you to read
[42:30] it
[42:31] now
[42:32] because in reading the Book of
[42:35] Revelations
[42:37] you find him speaking of price thing
[42:40] okay future thanks okay but the main
[42:44] concept of the Book of Revelations is
[42:46] present tense
[42:48] because he always says I
[42:52] am
[42:55] right
[42:57] chapter one one one two and three I am I
[43:01] am verse four five six seven eight nine
[43:04] ten I still own I am I am jumps over to
[43:08] the twelve still on I am just moving
[43:11] over into the bride form one lock under
[43:14] the son of man
[43:15] thing
[43:17] coming right down out of that right back
[43:20] in to speaking of his glory
[43:23] it's doing
[43:26] but now I watched this as I was reading
[43:29] through and I wish somebody would just
[43:32] cover said well brother Dale I found
[43:34] something you didn't read cuz I get
[43:35] tickle to that I don't I don't have any
[43:37] problem I read it I just did it didn't
[43:39] cross my mind
[43:40] but
[43:42] if you read the church ages
[43:47] all right
[43:49] you immediately find out
[43:53] that each church age
[43:56] begins
[43:58] with God
[44:01] telling who he is
[44:04] they say yeah but that was oaken
[44:06] relative 1 1 3 you know that was that's
[44:08] great that was wonderful but now each
[44:09] church age so it's not going to be a pie
[44:13] stand a prayer and a future tense
[44:18] if he says I am
[44:21] chapter 1 you know chapter 1 verse 1
[44:24] through 3 he says I am
[44:27] then he says I am the Keystone saying I
[44:30] am I am I am
[44:33] he never stops the saying of I am
[44:37] because that means present tense
[44:40] okay now listen to the point now
[44:44] see then each church age
[44:47] has about four things that
[44:50] each age compares together
[44:56] did you catch that and listen to it
[44:58] because it's very vital
[45:01] you read church age one church age to
[45:05] get a thought in your mind what you're
[45:07] looking for three four five six and
[45:10] seven you'll find the same thing
[45:15] to ever church age he says I know that
[45:20] works
[45:22] 1 through 7 he said I know that works
[45:27] each one of the church ages starts off
[45:30] by describing a part of his deity
[45:35] and what he is
[45:42] each church age
[45:46] has within it a rebuke
[45:52] or the way they're doing
[45:55] each church age has a message to the
[45:59] over comer
[46:03] and each age has the statement he that
[46:08] have to hear let him hear what the
[46:10] spirit saith unto the church is
[46:13] plural not to just one he doesn't speak
[46:17] to one individual age
[46:19] all right
[46:21] now as I said there the other day of
[46:24] trying to get you to think about it
[46:27] ever age
[46:31] inherits from
[46:34] the other ages
[46:37] so we can read one church age and it
[46:41] says you know I'll give you to be the
[46:44] you're not blot out your name one of
[46:47] them says we don't want that message
[46:49] goes to all seven ages
[46:52] cuz remember what the spirit saith unto
[46:55] the church is
[46:58] the message to each age will relate if
[47:02] you'll follow it and just read it
[47:05] and do do like I've done I've got it
[47:09] written on my Bible
[47:12] God telling who thing is
[47:15] God praising God rebuking and then God
[47:20] speaking to the overcomer
[47:23] so you don't read like that
[47:26] we're gonna read it so let's turn now go
[47:29] ahead I told him I try not to those are
[47:32] they were kind of down on the pole in
[47:33] their own today somewhere out visiting
[47:36] and I said well we'll try to try to just
[47:40] not do it so let's go I told them go to
[47:41] go to chapter two
[47:44] now let's read this and if we read all
[47:47] set 6-8 will read six eight cause the
[47:49] seventh age I'm not gonna speak anything
[47:50] about it I'm gonna tell you that right
[47:52] now we'll do it the Lord willing wins t
[47:54] because it has a special all right but
[47:57] look what it's doing
[48:00] okay
[48:03] unto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus
[48:06] now we're watching four things
[48:08] one to tell who is a
[48:12] descriptive form of who he is and who
[48:15] speaking to a praise to the people of
[48:20] that age and to their works and their
[48:23] things they're doing three it'll have a
[48:26] rebuke and
[48:28] four it will come back to a praise which
[48:31] is really coming back to the overcomer
[48:34] all right so now let's watch that let's
[48:36] see if we can read it until the Angel of
[48:38] the Church of Ephesus write these things
[48:40] saith he that holdeth the seven stars in
[48:42] his right hand who walketh in the midst
[48:43] of the seven golden candlesticks that's
[48:45] the same person of revelations one that
[48:49] tells you I am
[48:51] right all right now listen I know thy
[48:55] works
[48:56] telling who he is verse 1 now the praise
[49:00] I know thy works and thy labour and thy
[49:05] patience and then how that thou canst
[49:07] not by the in which are evil and thou
[49:09] has tried them which say they are
[49:11] apostles and are not and has found them
[49:13] liars and you're supposed to be reading
[49:16] the church ages with this so I'm not
[49:18] going to go in to try to express the
[49:21] thoughts of what it is you should have
[49:23] brought it out you know how do you try
[49:25] an apostle you should say I should say
[49:27] how do you try five well by the word you
[49:29] know you ought to know what the Prophet
[49:31] said
[49:32] because that's what he said you're
[49:34] trying by the word alright I'm just
[49:36] trying to get you to read something for
[49:38] one time in your life reads something
[49:41] instructive that they'll see each church
[49:44] age has the same thing
[49:49] and that's the writing of the Word of
[49:52] God
[49:52] but remember as that church age was
[49:56] coming forth it was present tense you
[50:03] move into the next one
[50:05] its present tense okay follow it now
[50:08] look
[50:09] look what he praised him the works and
[50:12] the patience and the thing
[50:14] and has morning have patience and for my
[50:16] name's sake hast laboured and has not
[50:18] fainted what a great praise to that age
[50:21] now look nevertheless here comes to
[50:24] rebuke I have somewhat against thee
[50:27] because I have left our first look it
[50:29] over therefore from whence thou art
[50:31] fallen and repent and do the first works
[50:34] or else I will come unto thee quickly
[50:35] and will remove thy candlestick out of
[50:38] his place except thou repent you
[50:41] remember what I was saying the other day
[50:42] most people think the book of Revelation
[50:44] church ages especially is written and it
[50:47] is to two people it's written to
[50:49] churches
[50:50] true and false but they thank God
[50:52] rebukes the faults and praises the truth
[50:54] now where's he gonna pull the
[50:56] candlestick out of the faults
[50:59] ok
[51:01] read some times for yourself instead of
[51:03] taking what somebody else and their
[51:05] concept thought me or anybody
[51:08] read it for yourself
[51:11] now he jumps right back look but this
[51:14] now has to tell hate us the deeds of the
[51:16] Nicolaitans which also hate that first
[51:18] church age the one thing you'll find as
[51:21] you move in the ages if you'll read it
[51:24] and compare them read it right there
[51:26] read the next reading really you'll find
[51:29] the praises becomes less
[51:33] but not what he praises them for doesn't
[51:37] so you got praise and then you got a
[51:41] review now you're right back to praise
[51:43] again because that was the first church
[51:45] age but you start falling away you don't
[51:48] have a lot of praise you have to be real
[51:50] careful to read it he that hath an ear
[51:53] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[51:54] the churches to him that overcometh will
[51:56] I eat over the Tree of Life which is in
[51:58] the midst of the paradise of God so you
[52:00] promise to overcomer
[52:05] who God is
[52:08] the praise to the church the rebuke
[52:12] comes back and reap raises and ends it
[52:15] with telling them what they receive as
[52:18] an overcomer
[52:19] and
[52:21] remember that point he had an ear let
[52:25] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[52:26] churches plural
[52:27] him that overcometh I'll give to eat of
[52:29] the Tree of Life which is in the midst
[52:31] of the paradise of God every age gets
[52:33] that statement
[52:35] don't isolate it to just one age gets
[52:38] one statement every age in
[52:45] Hertz you want it
[52:49] let's see if I can find it huh I laid it
[52:52] down on my nose oh
[52:57] how can I overcome
[53:00] there's going to be some overcomers in
[53:04] there what they remember each church age
[53:08] the one preceding it in her it's all
[53:12] that the other ages offer
[53:15] huh I don't get confused in that
[53:19] statement
[53:20] listen to the statement
[53:23] each age inherits what the other agent
[53:27] Harris
[53:28] you're gonna inherit the Tree of Life
[53:33] that's the first church age you mean
[53:35] you're not gonna get the trip huh no
[53:37] I'll see you ain't thinking sensibly
[53:39] just think of the inheritance that comes
[53:42] to each age and let it keep building
[53:44] until it builds to this age
[53:49] then you'll see why we're left here I'll
[53:52] hold that till Thursday I'm into
[53:54] Wednesday all right go to second Church
[53:56] at age what it unto the angel church in
[53:58] Smyrna write these things saith the
[54:01] first in the lice which was dead and his
[54:03] life
[54:04] showing you who he is all right I know
[54:07] thy works same statement same statement
[54:11] the first church age in
[54:12] tribulation and poverty with dark rich
[54:15] and I know the blasphemy of them that
[54:17] say they are Jews and are not but are
[54:19] the synagogue of Satan fear none of
[54:21] those things he praising
[54:23] which thou shalt suffer behold the devil
[54:27] shall cast some of you into prison that
[54:29] you may be tried and you shall have
[54:31] tribulation 10 days will be thou
[54:33] faithful unto death and I will give thee
[54:35] a crown of life now what does he say
[54:41] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[54:43] the spirit saith unto the churches
[54:47] the each one if you want to back up and
[54:50] reread that coming down we missed a
[54:52] verse in there but each one gets a
[54:55] an announcement of who he is
[54:58] the Sevenfold glory of his person if
[55:01] you'll read that in the church age book
[55:02] you'll get the whole story together each
[55:05] one gets of glory or an explanation of
[55:08] the glory of God and what he is then it
[55:11] gets to rephrase for what they went
[55:13] through then it gets a rebuke
[55:16] for falling away
[55:18] then it gets right back to the end
[55:22] because remember what I said when I went
[55:24] through about three weeks trying to
[55:26] explain one thing
[55:29] that God showed the bride how perfect
[55:33] she was in revelations 1 through 14 13
[55:38] 14 before she ever come on earth
[55:42] he shows us already perfect to him that
[55:46] happen here see
[55:48] what
[55:50] and it's the angel of church of pergolas
[55:53] these things saith he which hath the
[55:56] sharp two-edged to a sharp sword with
[55:59] two edges who is that the Lord Jesus
[56:00] Christ and what I know that works same
[56:03] thing and where thou dwellest even where
[56:06] Satan's seat is see the praise and I'll
[56:08] hold us fast my name and I shall have
[56:11] not denied my faith even in those days
[56:13] wherein Antipas ever had pronounced it
[56:16] was my faithful martyr who was slain
[56:19] among you where Satan dwelleth but I
[56:21] have a few things against thee rebuke
[56:25] because thou hast there them that hold
[56:28] the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balak
[56:31] to cast a stumbling-block before the
[56:33] children of Israel to eat things
[56:34] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[56:36] fornication one by the third Church ages
[56:39] are already picking up from a deed to a
[56:42] doctrine right you go through all of
[56:45] that I'm trying to get you to just read
[56:47] something and look at it look so hence
[56:50] there also them that hold the doctrine
[56:53] and a nickel lanten's me which thing I
[56:57] hate repent or else I'll come unto thee
[56:59] quickly and will fight against them with
[57:02] the sword of my mouth
[57:06] looks bad but now watch him he that hath
[57:09] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[57:10] saith unto the church to him that
[57:12] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[57:14] hidden manna and I will give him a white
[57:17] stone and in the stone a new name
[57:20] written which no man knoweth saving he
[57:22] that receiveth
[57:25] so there's an overcomer
[57:28] it always starts telling who God is
[57:31] coming to a rebuke or a praise you can
[57:35] throw them backwards or forth but it'll
[57:36] be a praise then a rebuke then right
[57:39] back to tell who you are and
[57:42] remember ever overcomer gets the sign
[57:46] it ain't one age gets it and we don't
[57:49] get it we all wind up getting the same
[57:52] cuz when we get to glory talked about it
[57:54] last night when we get to glory it's not
[57:57] going to be us looking down on Luther
[57:59] you just oh you had was justification
[58:03] so we we don't have time for you we are
[58:07] the top echelon
[58:08] no he's just hidden hurts everything you
[58:11] and her it and you and heard everything
[58:13] he and hurts right
[58:17] cuz that's our God come on let's go to
[58:19] and the angel little Church in town I
[58:21] write
[58:22] these things saith the son of God who
[58:25] hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire
[58:27] and his feet are like fine Bryce I did
[58:30] include a revelation 1 12 13 14 all
[58:33] right there is that statement again I
[58:35] know thy works
[58:37] these church age that statement is in
[58:40] each church 8 works is not works to try
[58:44] to save works as an expression of your
[58:47] salvation
[58:48] so it's not to just that he's praising
[58:51] their works that you're trying to be
[58:52] saved he's praising them for the life
[58:54] they're living under the condition
[58:56] they're living in
[58:58] come off you don't bleed go back and
[59:00] read the church age book and see what he
[59:01] says I know thy works and charity and
[59:03] service and faith and thy patience and
[59:05] thy works and the life's to be more than
[59:07] first now watch him
[59:10] crazy but watching notwithstanding I
[59:13] have a few things against thee rebuke
[59:15] because thou sufferest that woman
[59:17] Jezebel which calleth herself a
[59:19] prophetess to teach and to seduce My
[59:21] servants to commit fornication and eat
[59:23] things sacrificed unto idols and I gave
[59:27] her space to repent of her fornication
[59:29] she repented not behold I cast her into
[59:32] the bed and them that commit adultery
[59:35] with her in the Great Tribulation except
[59:36] they repent I will kill her children
[59:38] with death and all the churches the
[59:41] hitting that falls fine right shall know
[59:43] that I am he that searches the reigns
[59:45] and our but unto you I say
[59:48] and to the rest that our entire time as
[59:52] many as have not this doctrine and which
[59:55] have not known the depths of Satan as
[59:58] they speak I will put upon you nor the
[1:00:01] burden coming back to a praise or
[1:00:04] telling now it comes right back to the
[1:00:05] same one he that overcometh and keepeth
[1:00:09] my works unto the end to him I will give
[1:00:12] power over the nation's and he shall
[1:00:15] rule them with a rod of iron as the
[1:00:17] vessels of Potter's shall they be broken
[1:00:19] or civil as I receive of my father and I
[1:00:22] will give him the morning star
[1:00:25] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:00:28] the spirit saith unto the churches come
[1:00:31] on what is it and unto the Angel of the
[1:00:35] Church of Sardis write these things
[1:00:38] saith he that he that he that hath the
[1:00:41] seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars
[1:00:44] I know thy works same statement that
[1:00:48] thou has the name that delivers and our
[1:00:50] dead because that's where you'd lost the
[1:00:51] name of Jesus coming in to Luther and
[1:00:54] Wesley and all of that okay go ahead
[1:00:59] we stopped on three one
[1:01:04] no comfort no that's okay because the
[1:01:08] point is what
[1:01:10] the point is on the one okay we got it
[1:01:14] man
[1:01:15] be watchful and strengthen the things
[1:01:17] which remain
[1:01:19] there ready to die for I have not found
[1:01:22] thy works perfect before God why because
[1:01:25] they had come in to the fifth and the
[1:01:27] sixth church age you got so mixed up
[1:01:30] until
[1:01:32] you couldn't tell the difference hardly
[1:01:34] and the true and the false fine but just
[1:01:37] remember
[1:01:38] Luther's justification was enough for
[1:01:41] salvation in his day
[1:01:45] so remember you're not going to lose it
[1:01:47] be watchful and strengthen the things
[1:01:49] which remain that are ready to wear I
[1:01:51] have not found thy works perfect before
[1:01:52] God remember therefore how thou has
[1:01:55] received and heard and whole face and
[1:01:57] repent if thou therefore thou shalt not
[1:02:01] watch I'll come on thee as a thief and
[1:02:05] thou shalt not know what hour I will
[1:02:08] come upon the eat watch him
[1:02:10] thou hast a few names even in sardis
[1:02:14] which have not defiled their garments
[1:02:16] praising them and I shall walk with them
[1:02:19] in white for they are worthy when they
[1:02:21] say he that overcometh the same shall be
[1:02:24] clothed in white raiment and I will not
[1:02:27] blot out his name out of the book of
[1:02:29] life but I will confess his name before
[1:02:32] my father and before his angels he that
[1:02:36] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:02:40] saith unto the churches and unto the
[1:02:41] Angel of the church in Philadelphia
[1:02:43] write these things said he that is holy
[1:02:46] telling who is he that is true he that
[1:02:49] hath the key of David he that opening of
[1:02:51] no man shutteth and shutteth than no man
[1:02:53] openeth I know thy works
[1:02:55] behold I was set before thee an open
[1:02:58] door
[1:02:59] now we'll back up
[1:03:02] Wednesday to this point because this is
[1:03:06] what I want you to see he set before
[1:03:08] thee an open door that
[1:03:10] was the revelation of the deity of Jesus
[1:03:12] Christ right
[1:03:14] that was given starting back in Luthor's
[1:03:19] age to come for coming on over into
[1:03:21] Wesley and the revealing of the name of
[1:03:23] Jesus all right now because that's very
[1:03:26] wonderful to where we are but think
[1:03:29] every age gets that
[1:03:33] that's the point I want you to see every
[1:03:35] age kid I'll make them with a synagogue
[1:03:38] of Satan which say they're Jews and are
[1:03:41] not but do lie behold I'll make them to
[1:03:44] come and worship before thy feet and to
[1:03:46] know that I have loved thee because thou
[1:03:49] has kept the word of
[1:03:50] my patience although I will keep thee
[1:03:54] from the hour of temptation which shall
[1:03:57] come upon all the world to try them that
[1:03:59] dwell upon the earth behold I come
[1:04:02] quickly
[1:04:03] hold that face which thou has that no
[1:04:06] man take thy crown him that overcometh I
[1:04:09] will make a pillar in the temple of my
[1:04:11] god and he shall go no more out and I'll
[1:04:14] write upon him the name of my god and
[1:04:16] the name of the city of my god which is
[1:04:19] New Jerusalem which cometh down out of
[1:04:21] heaven from my god and I will write upon
[1:04:23] him my new name he that half a year let
[1:04:27] him hear what the spirit at the Sun did
[1:04:30] you follow the layout
[1:04:32] each age tells who he is the Lord Jesus
[1:04:36] he says gets a praise for their work and
[1:04:40] they're doing their works because every
[1:04:42] church age all seven it has I know that
[1:04:44] works
[1:04:45] all right that was their lives they were
[1:04:48] living in that age but remember what
[1:04:52] they were living now to get a point way
[1:04:54] back up they were living present-tense
[1:04:58] there was a time when that was written
[1:05:01] when John was riding on Patmos the first
[1:05:04] church age was basically already over
[1:05:06] with starting into the second one that
[1:05:09] has nothing to do with it
[1:05:12] it's speaking of Paul and them present
[1:05:17] tense if you get it present tense you
[1:05:20] won't you won't hold so much on
[1:05:22] something of the past
[1:05:27] because you're always looking back well
[1:05:31] boy bless God look at him look at him
[1:05:32] the day we had it on the day of
[1:05:34] Pentecost we're not when that happened
[1:05:35] we had a tire we had a great thing in
[1:05:37] Azusa Street but where we're at now we
[1:05:40] just did
[1:05:41] I've always said this whether you like
[1:05:44] it or what I don't care because I speak
[1:05:48] plain and blunt
[1:05:49] you take the book of Acts
[1:05:55] come on you take the book of Acts and
[1:05:59] put it in the lady you'll see an age
[1:06:03] and see how many overcomers you got
[1:06:08] you know what I'm saying now you take
[1:06:11] the people in the book of Acts that had
[1:06:13] no hindrances and time that's why I said
[1:06:15] to start with and want to say it when
[1:06:17] you start reading if you'll look at it
[1:06:19] chapter where you read first searched
[1:06:22] second 33rd church a you get more
[1:06:24] praising for what's going on because
[1:06:27] that was what was taking place was
[1:06:30] wonderful then it started to dwindle
[1:06:37] you think Paul had trouble with the
[1:06:40] Pharisees and Sadducees and the
[1:06:42] Herodians
[1:06:43] what would he do with 969 different
[1:06:46] denominations facing it what would he do
[1:06:49] with his people of this message facing
[1:06:50] them
[1:06:52] he'd say I'm going back to Ephesus
[1:06:55] that's the place I stay because that's
[1:06:58] what I do and Lord let me go back get me
[1:07:02] away from this junk brother Branham said
[1:07:05] the very spirit
[1:07:08] that those people under the Fox a book
[1:07:11] of martyrs and the killing of the
[1:07:13] millions is the same spirit we use daily
[1:07:19] to overcome
[1:07:27] will prevail do you want to go back are
[1:07:29] where they killing the people
[1:07:32] sometimes would be easier
[1:07:34] because I can quote brother Branham to
[1:07:37] you he said those people back in those
[1:07:40] ages he they just walked right into
[1:07:42] death because it was the spirit of the
[1:07:45] age
[1:07:47] they wasn't screaming in Holland they
[1:07:50] just walked right into death
[1:07:55] the same spirit they used for that we it
[1:07:59] takes that for you and I to just
[1:08:00] overcome every day
[1:08:04] now come on
[1:08:06] come on think about life
[1:08:10] and think about how far it's gone that's
[1:08:14] what I said we'll pick up this the lady
[1:08:17] you see in church eggs we're willing
[1:08:19] wins T
[1:08:20] but think of how it's gone I
[1:08:24] think of the fifty years forty eight
[1:08:27] technically
[1:08:31] be still hear another message Anna and
[1:08:35] to think of how far this thing has went
[1:08:41] you're saying well I didn't think he'd
[1:08:43] go this way in time I'm saying I didn't
[1:08:46] think he'd get this horrible
[1:08:51] we don't have to name names
[1:08:55] there's no use of it but you know what
[1:08:58] has happened to the biggest portion of
[1:09:00] the ministries of this message the older
[1:09:03] ones especially
[1:09:04] what has happened
[1:09:10] they have turned against the message
[1:09:14] you got to admit that's right
[1:09:18] well that's brother Dale that's just
[1:09:21] their way of seeing it I
[1:09:24] didn't know we had any right to
[1:09:26] interpret the word I
[1:09:31] thought we had only the right to believe
[1:09:34] it and accept it I
[1:09:38] ain't never said nobody's gonna die and
[1:09:40] go to hell because they don't believe
[1:09:41] what brother Dale said you go tell
[1:09:43] somebody that you're our liar
[1:09:46] that's the best way to say it cuz I
[1:09:48] ain't never told nothing like that
[1:09:50] cuz I believe every individual stands
[1:09:53] before God for themselves I
[1:09:57] can't put you in the body and I can't
[1:10:01] take you out of the body
[1:10:04] right you have to do that
[1:10:09] but to realize that you can follow that
[1:10:13] church ages
[1:10:15] read it compare each church age and see
[1:10:19] the things that I spoke first telling
[1:10:21] who God is second praising the church
[1:10:24] for what they're doing and how they're
[1:10:26] putting up with all of the things third
[1:10:28] rebuking them because they do go wrong
[1:10:33] not lost
[1:10:35] they go wrong
[1:10:39] with any turns right back to tell you
[1:10:43] how much an overcomer
[1:10:45] inherits
[1:10:49] and see whether you think it's that way
[1:10:51] or not that's alright with me but to
[1:10:54] think that
[1:10:55] everything those people got back down
[1:10:58] through there
[1:11:00] the right to the Tree of Life the name
[1:11:02] written to do all of those things
[1:11:05] it's all given to you
[1:11:09] because you're the age that's the most
[1:11:12] horrible
[1:11:13] this is the worst age of all ages
[1:11:16] because there's a matter of fact if
[1:11:18] you'll read it I'll read it Wednesday
[1:11:19] you find little praise in the seventh
[1:11:24] church
[1:11:25] read if you say you find less praise and
[1:11:29] less
[1:11:31] admonishing zand things in the seventh
[1:11:34] church age you find in any age
[1:11:40] because it's come down to the end
[1:11:43] but also remember one time
[1:11:47] everything they get as an overcomer we
[1:11:52] get
[1:11:54] because it doesn't say we're waiting on
[1:11:57] them
[1:11:59] it says day without us
[1:12:02] cannot be made perfect
[1:12:06] you realized that all the ages is
[1:12:09] waiting to this age
[1:12:14] read it and see take each one of the
[1:12:17] overcomers just write it down on the
[1:12:19] side this age gets the overcomes in this
[1:12:21] age gets it overcomes in this age gets
[1:12:23] you and then read every one of them and
[1:12:25] put them to yourself
[1:12:29] no wonder brother Branham said
[1:12:32] I'd rather be here than any age
[1:12:36] right
[1:12:39] then any time he said he'd rather be
[1:12:42] here
[1:12:43] of all of the bad and all the thoughts
[1:12:46] I'd rather be here
[1:12:49] cause you see listen church for one time
[1:12:53] in life
[1:12:55] yeah you're gonna have to listen to
[1:12:57] understand
[1:12:59] for one time in my life my mind is clear
[1:13:07] because he has brought us to the word
[1:13:12] why wouldn't you want to say it like
[1:13:14] that I
[1:13:17] admit that my mind was not clear upon
[1:13:22] the doctrines of the message I admit
[1:13:25] that it wasn't clear on the things we
[1:13:27] even tried to preach into badness
[1:13:30] that's what I was telling them last
[1:13:32] night see brother Brennan said you
[1:13:34] better leave them badness alone and
[1:13:36] what's he talking about I was telling
[1:13:39] them last night you realized in the
[1:13:41] Baptist Church we were looking for the
[1:13:44] end of the world to come by 19 and 88
[1:13:49] because Israel would be established in
[1:13:52] the nation in 48 and we could count 40
[1:13:55] years
[1:13:57] there's people out there that knows a
[1:13:59] lot more about the Bible and you think
[1:14:01] they do
[1:14:04] and maybe fallen some of it better than
[1:14:07] we are
[1:14:13] you don't remember how muddled your mind
[1:14:15] was when you'd read something even read
[1:14:18] the Prophet and he'd say something and
[1:14:21] your mind just wasn't clear see that's
[1:14:24] what it's supposed to do
[1:14:26] this is where we're at
[1:14:30] this message is coming to change this
[1:14:33] body right number right it's coming for
[1:14:37] the change of the body we're gonna work
[1:14:39] got to work out
[1:14:41] you said well now you brought now wait a
[1:14:43] minute your mind does have something to
[1:14:45] do with it don't go along don't jump so
[1:14:47] quick don't say well my mind don't have
[1:14:49] it has something to do with it
[1:14:52] remember it's not what we overcome it's
[1:14:57] how we overcome the Prophet said and he
[1:15:01] said well can only overcome by being in
[1:15:03] Jesus Christ so then we can only have a
[1:15:06] clear mind if the mind of Christ can
[1:15:08] come into our human brain
[1:15:12] and drop down into our soul to
[1:15:16] be made alive
[1:15:21] because listen the biggest portion of
[1:15:25] the Bible's done been fulfilled
[1:15:28] there's things that will take place when
[1:15:31] we leave out of here all right
[1:15:33] I'm only interested in what's taking
[1:15:36] place right now
[1:15:41] my brother Dylan
[1:15:44] I like to talk about what's coming
[1:15:46] that's all right
[1:15:48] that's all right we talk about what's
[1:15:51] coming but remember what's coming is not
[1:15:54] here and remember Satan can impersonate
[1:15:57] it like I told him last night see Satan
[1:16:02] can impersonate
[1:16:03] you get something figured out be careful
[1:16:07] and I made the illustration I said what
[1:16:11] if a form walks into this church today
[1:16:14] and
[1:16:17] you're able enough to see it
[1:16:22] are you gonna holler and say the
[1:16:24] resurrection is already pice they're
[1:16:26] dead tomorrow among us
[1:16:29] that might not be what you're looking at
[1:16:31] it might be an impersonation
[1:16:37] Satan can impersonate everything so you
[1:16:41] say what are we gonna do
[1:16:43] what are you gonna do if it does
[1:16:46] what are you gonna do if something
[1:16:49] appears in your home
[1:16:51] and you see it to look like a person
[1:16:55] now come on let's get sensible this for
[1:16:59] another second
[1:17:00] now what is that word I know I'll miss
[1:17:03] it but what does it call heliograph
[1:17:05] how's that word where they can protect a
[1:17:08] person's image Polygram ok
[1:17:12] Polygram Holly I know it had to a sin
[1:17:15] and I wasn't looking for the P all right
[1:17:18] hologram all right
[1:17:22] Justin Franklin has about 10 churches
[1:17:26] do you know what
[1:17:28] people in those 10 churches can set down
[1:17:31] look at him
[1:17:33] not because of a video but because of
[1:17:36] projection
[1:17:38] that they can make
[1:17:43] if they can do that and project him over
[1:17:46] into another Church and he stands out
[1:17:48] looking just as real as can be
[1:17:51] don't you think Satan's gonna
[1:17:53] impersonate it
[1:17:55] we could be here too sir and here could
[1:17:59] come angels walking in it we think be
[1:18:01] careful
[1:18:05] it might be somebody projecting you well
[1:18:09] ok brother Dale now how are we gonna
[1:18:11] know
[1:18:12] or to quit and go home let you leave
[1:18:15] with that for a while and let your time
[1:18:16] how are you gonna know whether that's
[1:18:19] real or not
[1:18:23] serious question a
[1:18:26] situation that could take plunge how are
[1:18:28] you gonna know
[1:18:31] do you have the answer
[1:18:38] why don't you do what the Prophet said
[1:18:40] give it the word touch
[1:18:43] he said to do that on any thought you
[1:18:46] don't matter where it's the devil or who
[1:18:48] it is or what's taking place you you
[1:18:51] give it to word test remember in the
[1:18:54] Bible about
[1:18:58] the the way that it was described and
[1:19:02] they could come forth
[1:19:04] but if they take you to another God
[1:19:12] now what are you going to do if here
[1:19:14] comes walking in two or three people
[1:19:16] that look so real until that's amazing
[1:19:19] but even the images and the things that
[1:19:21] they can project
[1:19:23] and what if that
[1:19:26] image or person is you and call it
[1:19:29] starts talking
[1:19:34] and declares them to be the angels of
[1:19:37] the Lord that's come here to straighten
[1:19:39] you out on these doctrines that you've
[1:19:42] got because you're not believe this
[1:19:44] William Branham to be a prophet
[1:19:46] now how are you gonna argue with
[1:19:49] our stands something in front of you
[1:19:55] declaring
[1:19:58] well brother then what you gonna do
[1:20:01] I'm gonna say we don't want you in here
[1:20:03] would you mind leaving
[1:20:05] because we're following the message
[1:20:08] and we believe the message and you say
[1:20:12] you don't believe it
[1:20:14] but yet you say you're an angel of God
[1:20:16] if here's an angel the devil I know you
[1:20:19] don't believe it what are you gonna do
[1:20:23] those thanks brother tell ain't gonna
[1:20:25] happen what if they do
[1:20:30] remember what in the church ages are
[1:20:33] they tried them that said they were
[1:20:35] apostles
[1:20:36] they wouldn't play in with no gila grass
[1:20:40] or ever watch y'all words he say I can't
[1:20:41] never pronounce anything twice
[1:20:44] it ain't no that they were real
[1:20:51] coal musician what you gonna do I'm just
[1:20:54] asking a question
[1:20:56] you see why it's so vital to know what
[1:20:59] the word says
[1:21:02] right
[1:21:03] so vital to understand
[1:21:06] how serious it is about the word
[1:21:15] but oh what I think about
[1:21:23] for the new he's telling her the other
[1:21:25] day about that man I
[1:21:30] quoted it he didn't have a book but he
[1:21:32] had a book but he didn't have a drawing
[1:21:35] of brother Branham to show anything
[1:21:37] about the thing we yet he had to Daniel
[1:21:41] 70 weeks to write I
[1:21:49] say God was with him
[1:21:55] what a glorious thing to be able to see
[1:21:58] the Word of God and to follow it
[1:22:00] straight through
[1:22:02] and have a clear mind about things in
[1:22:07] God's Word
[1:22:10] are you confused about whether these two
[1:22:12] or three gods are one garter what's good
[1:22:15] something's wrong with you
[1:22:18] after you've followed the message 40 or
[1:22:21] 50 years and then you turn against it as
