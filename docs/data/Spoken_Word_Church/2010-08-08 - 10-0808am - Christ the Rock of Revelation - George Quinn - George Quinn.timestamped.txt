[37:10] that's our uh when a person uh seeks

[37:18] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you
[37:20] will find the Holy Ghost amen he will
[37:21] lead you on to it uh I don't think I'll
[37:24] be speaking about it today brother
[37:25] Samuel but I I didn't want to get I just
[37:28] want everything was just in such a
[37:29] perfect order I wanted just to leave it
[37:31] there yesterday amen uh but I will say
[37:33] this we were uh preaching a message on
[37:36] the concept of the bride and uh you know
[37:40] God being Eternal his thoughts have to
[37:42] be Eternal and uh Paul says that I may
[37:47] know even as I am knowing right and if
[37:50] God ever knew us amen well where do we
[37:53] fit into an eternal thought it has to go
[37:56] back into eternity amen and uh praise
[37:59] the Lord that if God thought about us
[38:02] then and here we are manifested today
[38:06] amen still in his thoughts right still
[38:09] under his observation amen under his
[38:11] care and he can never ever we can never
[38:15] uh ever get rid of them thoughts as it
[38:16] were you know because brother Bram said
[38:18] that the bride was the Eternal thought
[38:20] of God and so that's where
[38:23] predestination and things come in amen
[38:26] and uh praise the Lord your name was
[38:28] written in that book amen before the
[38:30] foundation of the world because you were
[38:32] in the Eternal thoughts of God and when
[38:34] you come and seek him with all your
[38:36] heart and fill him and I would say if
[38:38] there's any young persons here today
[38:40] that uh certainly uh don't feel that
[38:43] they have the Holy Spirit Well just you
[38:46] keep seeking God Amen and and it's
[38:48] essential to live you'll never live in
[38:50] this world without the Holy Spirit
[38:52] exactly amen there's too just too much
[38:54] going on out there but when you've got
[38:56] the holy ghost sealed in you'll be
[38:59] sealed to the day of redemption and I'll
[39:01] tell you what we'll all make it in
[39:03] Praise the Lord and God will make sure
[39:04] we make it in look folks it's not
[39:06] anything that we have ever did it's not
[39:08] anything that we're going to do but he
[39:10] will keep us we are kept by the power of
[39:12] God Amen he started the work I think
[39:14] brother Samuel said that at one point
[39:16] and he will finish it praise the Lord so
[39:18] it's just a matter of trusting simply
[39:20] trusting every day and just knowing
[39:23] where you are knowing that you're a a
[39:25] stone in that body Hallelujah and that
[39:27] spiritual body of Christ amen and you
[39:29] take your place and your position amen
[39:32] and it's so wonderful so I'm I'm so
[39:33] thankful amen that God in his great
[39:37] concept of a bride and how that Adam
[39:40] fell but amen that's where it all came
[39:42] from that's why with spiritual death and
[39:45] how we had to be reborn spiritually amen
[39:49] and get into that uh Fellowship amen and
[39:51] be reconciled back to God as Sons and
[39:54] Daughters of God you should know the B
[39:57] Paul says that you know we would be WRA
[39:59] your bits if we didn't know that we're a
[40:00] son or daughter of God you would know
[40:02] that this morning amen praise the Lord
[40:04] you know what your own situation is
[40:06] today and I hope everybody can say that
[40:08] I really do that everybody can say I am
[40:10] a daughter of God or I am a Son of God
[40:13] whatever it is this morning praise the
[40:15] Lord but I just want to say a few things

[41:11] the reality in their life of Jesus
[41:14] Christ for that's what it all about

[41:58] tries to come in the realm of the mind

[42:03] tries all he's always trying trying to
[42:05] Le nures for you trying to uh take you
[42:07] off the path even with a little wrong
[42:09] thought but you know um he would say to
[42:12] you will you see sister Rebecca you
[42:13] haven't got enough Faith but that's not
[42:15] right because we we have faith praise
[42:18] God Amen no matter how small the faith
[42:20] is like I told her just very briefly
[42:23] yesterday when I had that stone and it's
[42:25] a marvelous story but uh up in the
[42:28] hospital uh I I was just lying there in
[42:31] the bed and uh I just remember I was in
[42:35] a kind of a Twilight world you know I'm
[42:37] sure you've been in there and I was in a
[42:40] kind of Twilight world and I'm thinking
[42:42] to myself you know Lord I I've preached
[42:45] to your people Faith I've always
[42:47] preached faith and yet I don't even know
[42:50] if I got faith myself to be
[42:53] healed and I remember very distinctly
[42:56] saying but there is one thing I do
[43:00] believe that you are a Divine healer
[43:03] amen go to the gve believe or not
[43:06] there's at least two people have come up
[43:08] to me since I've come over that had
[43:12] needs in their body and they've
[43:15] testified that the Lord's met the needs
[43:18] amen somebody that couldn't shake
[43:20] something off but it shook off now I
[43:21] tell you that praise the lord well it's
[43:24] wonderful Hallelujah and so uh just like
[43:27] and you excuse me for doing this but
[43:28] just like like that that was gone amen
[43:32] and so I didn't feel any pain and I woke
[43:35] up I came come right out of it all come
[43:37] out of that Twilight Zone and this man
[43:40] in the next bed said oh you're feeling a
[43:42] lot better now and I said I sure I'm
[43:45] amen so then of course the consultant
[43:47] come in and he said well we'll keep you
[43:49] for a day or so you know in the end
[43:50] times they wouldn't do that today they
[43:51] throw you at the door you know we need
[43:54] your bed get out you know but there he
[43:57] said well let just St and anyway uh the
[44:00] next morning uh I passed Stone night so
[44:03] sister Rebecca all is well praise the
[44:05] Lord you keep believing that it's you

[44:10] scripture you know that it says that
[44:12] Sarah conceived strength to bring forth
[44:15] Isaac amen she received Faith to
[44:18] conceive that amen that's what it says
[44:20] in Hebrews chapter 11 you read it

[45:59] kind of a a Terminus for buses you know
[46:02] because of the price rather than have
[46:04] the big buses in the in the airport all
[46:06] expensive so you get a little uh bus you
[46:09] know that carries you over to the ter
[46:10] terminal about 10 minutes away a bus
[46:13] terminal so a little shuttle bus and
[46:15] it's free so I went over there and I
[46:17] went up to the the counter and said I
[46:19] want to go to Arna protect and says fine
[46:21] she could speak English and uh she's
[46:23] fine and she says now the bus goes at 5
[46:26] and I said well used to go 2:30 she said
[46:28] yeah but that's been changed and I said
[46:30] okay so I I that's okay so anyway I was
[46:32] waiting to 5:00 and 5:00 came now they
[46:35] have these big yellow buses that go down
[46:37] to ARA pet and go right on down to the
[46:39] Cambodia border and uh 5:00 came and
[46:42] there was no yellow bus and I'm thinking
[46:44] something's wrong here you know so
[46:46] anyway I'm I'm sitting there thinking
[46:48] and all of a sudden uh something got me
[46:50] off my feet the G and and I just went
[46:54] right back to her and I said look
[46:55] there's something wrong here because you
[46:57] know you said at
[46:58] 5:00 the bus and the fellow Bes her he
[47:01] can speak a bit English he said that bus
[47:03] is gone and I said how could it go I was

[47:13] last 5 years it's been a yellow bus you
[47:16] know and he said oh yeah that that
[47:18] they've changed their times too you know
[47:20] so I said thanks for telling me that but
[47:23] she was embarrassed and she just picked
[47:25] up her cell phone and like that there
[47:28] and she talked to something and then she
[47:29] said will you come with me and we walked
[47:30] out onto the main street right she th
[47:33] the taxi and there's plenty of them
[47:35] there you know and jumped in and I'm
[47:36] just following where are we going now

[47:42] bus in at the side where it could park
[47:45] and he had his flashers on the GU and I
[47:47] thought oh my she must have called this
[47:49] guy here so anyway uh she she talked to
[47:52] him and he kind of looked kind of give
[47:54] me a funny look you know yeah yeah yeah

[48:08] go to that desk right because I'll tell
[48:11] you what when I got on the bus it
[48:13] wouldn't have been any more than about a
[48:15] minute to two minutes than he was on the
[48:17] freeway he was on the interstate and he
[48:19] would not have turned back off the
[48:21] interstate for anybody and I would have
[48:22] been sitting in that bus station I
[48:24] probably got somewhere to stay all right
[48:26] but my the whole program would have been
[48:27] broken but the Lord knew that it wasn't
[48:29] my fault and he made up for it amen just
[48:32] at the right precise moment amen and I I
[48:35] I did I when I came back going to
[48:37] Vietnam I I I talked to her about it I
[48:39] just had a few words were nothing too
[48:40] hard but you know I said like you should
[48:43] explain these things to visitors they
[48:44] don't understand that you know that
[48:46] these changes are made like that so
[48:48] anyway it all worked out well and what I
[48:50] want to tell you is that God's never lit
[48:53] right amen when you need him at the
[48:54] right second at the right time he be
[48:57] there that's the truth praise the Lord

[56:56] scripture here but I just read in in uh
[56:58] 1 Corinthians uh 10 amen and the Apostle
[57:02] Paul says 1 Corinthians 10:1 says
[57:06] moreover Brethren I would not that you
[57:08] should be ignorant hi that all our
[57:11] fathers were under the cloud and all
[57:13] passed through the sea and were all
[57:15] baptized under Moses in the cloud and in
[57:17] the sea and did all eat the same
[57:21] spiritual meat he's not talking here
[57:22] about physical meat he's talking about
[57:24] spiritual meat and he said and all drink
[57:26] the same spiritual drink amen you see
[57:30] for they drank that spiritual rock that
[57:32] followed them and that rock was Christ
[57:36] amen amen I'll just leave it there for
[57:38] the for for for for uh amen you can read
[57:41] on at another time but we'll just leave
[57:42] it there for a moment and we'll come to
[57:44] the heavenly father gracious God this
[57:47] morning dear Lord Jesus as we come and
[57:50] thank you Lord uh this day of the week
[57:53] the first day of the week that you rose
[57:54] from the dead our Prophet told us that
[57:57] we honor your Resurrection by coming
[58:00] together on this day Lord a day that
[58:02] most of us don't have to work Lord maybe
[58:04] nurses or people Lord have to work at
[58:07] times but father most of us don't and
[58:09] we're so thankful that we can take this
[58:12] day as a day of rest a day of worship
[58:15] and a day to hear your word and to Lord
[58:18] consecrate Our Lives aresh to live for
[58:21] you so father we come and we thank you
[58:23] for the privilege to stand behind the
[58:26] holy desk and Lord we're asking that
[58:29] your holy spirit will speak that none
[58:32] will be seen save Jesus Christ only for
[58:35] we ask it in your Holy Name Lord Jesus
[58:38] amen amen amen praise the Lord you may
[58:40] be seated and it is a very simple or uh
[58:44] uh the title amen Christ the Rock of
[58:47] Revelation and of course the the the
[58:49] reason for the title would be when when
[58:51] the Lord said to Peter uh uh Peter said
[58:54] Thou Art the Christ uh amen the son of
[58:56] the Living God and and the Lord said to
[58:58] him uh Peter flesh and blood is not
[59:00] revealed that to you you know I I I
[59:03] don't think you get saved or we could
[59:04] get filled with the Holy Ghost if it
[59:06] wasn't a revelation it has to be amen a
[59:09] person that would say to brother Bram
[59:11] God doesn't reveal himself anymore
[59:13] that's nonsense amen praise God God will
[59:16] speak to you today Hallelujah I hope he
[59:19] does Amen you know a new thought a new
[59:23] thing today to your heart I believe it
[59:26] heart so God will reveal himself as he
[59:28] needs to reveal himself to you amen and
[59:31] I'll just give you an illustration of
[59:33] May that uh when we were up there in the
[59:35] camp meetings uh and we all know about
[59:37] the Lamb of God this is just very
[59:39] briefly we all you know when John said
[59:42] Behold the Lamb of God and we know the
[59:43] reason why the lamb and and all that
[59:46] there but you know sometimes maybe we
[59:48] think that um that that's it finished
[59:50] Jesus died on the cross that's the
[59:52] Lamb's interess or uh part plan but you
[59:56] know it's not amen because it's the L
[59:59] that takes the book amen it's the lamb
[1:00:02] that opens the book it's the L that
[1:00:03] gives the book to John praise the Lord
[1:00:05] and I'll tell you what amen at the end
[1:00:08] of it all it's the lamb that the the the
[1:00:12] the bride's wife amen and the Lamb's
[1:00:14] wife has made it's the L's wife amen so
[1:00:17] there's more to it than just saying
[1:00:18] Behold the Lamb of God you know that
[1:00:20] he's going to die for our sins it's much
[1:00:21] more deeper than that and and not only
[1:00:24] that but praise God we it off and I'm
[1:00:26] sure you do too but there's a country
[1:00:29] far beyond the Starry Sky there's a city
[1:00:31] where there never comes a night Amen on
[1:00:35] by and by we will go there Amen in the
[1:00:38] city where the lamb is the light so I
[1:00:41] tell you what you start off in Genesis
[1:00:43] and you got right to the Book of
[1:00:44] Revelation so that's what I'm saying and
[1:00:47] I knew I said I never thought about it
[1:00:48] like a nth you know and and praise God
[1:00:51] so God can speak to you you every day
[1:00:53] Hallelujah and give you something amen
[1:00:55] well you know in in Exodus 17 praise the
[1:00:59] Lord amen that uh we we are told that uh
[1:01:02] Moses was told to stand on the Rock and
[1:01:05] he said and horb and he says and th
[1:01:07] shall Smack That Rock and smack the Rock
[1:01:09] and he shall come out water and that the
[1:01:12] people may drink and so Moses did it in
[1:01:14] the sight of all the elders and of
[1:01:16] course they did drink amen praise the
[1:01:18] Lord and uh because uh he called it
[1:01:21] Mirah because the children of Israel had
[1:01:24] tempted the Lord at that place amen is
[1:01:26] the Lord among us or not we should never
[1:01:29] ever uh uh have that thought is the Lord
[1:01:32] among us or not the Lord is always going
[1:01:35] to be among us he said I will never
[1:01:37] leave you amen he is faithful that is
[1:01:40] Promised so there's no way and and folks
[1:01:43] if there would be anyone today thinking
[1:01:45] you know well the devil's been really
[1:01:47] bombarded me and I feel God doesn't love
[1:01:49] me I'm maybe not what I should be or
[1:01:51] something like that but amen it's not
[1:01:54] praise the Lord uh where we are but he
[1:01:57] said I will never leave you right and
[1:02:01] his word is true Hallelujah so not leave
[1:02:04] us amen and for and confirm the word and
[1:02:07] so here was Moses and uh he Smit That
[1:02:10] Rock Amen then of course of you go on
[1:02:12] over to uh numbers 23 which I want to
[1:02:14] come back to later in the message amen
[1:02:17] but we we see that when Moses is told
[1:02:20] again they're uh thirsting for water I
[1:02:23] mean you know it was Israel that got
[1:02:25] themselves in this sitation they were
[1:02:28] most times we as we get ourselves into
[1:02:30] the situation praise the Lord that we
[1:02:32] get ourselves into and uh and so uh they
[1:02:35] would not need it to go through the
[1:02:37] Wilderness amen but they said to them
[1:02:40] there can the Lord provide a tiil in the
[1:02:42] wilderness and he answered it right away
[1:02:43] yes he can Hallelujah more so than maybe
[1:02:46] your president who can say yes he
[1:02:49] can amen so we're not going into that
[1:02:51] but I tell you the Lord can make a table
[1:02:53] in the wilderness the Lord can say and
[1:02:56] them fil di all around the camp come on
[1:02:58] but when they lust it with it in for
[1:03:00] their M amen he slew many of them that
[1:03:02] day so you don't tempt the Lord amen for
[1:03:06] he will not tempt you the Bible says God
[1:03:08] tempts no man neither can he himself be
[1:03:10] tempted so we know that to be the truth
[1:03:12] praise the Lord then uh so uh Moses was
[1:03:15] commanded to speak to the Rock right to
[1:03:18] speak to the Rock and uh well just think
[1:03:21] about it I'll just give you this thought
[1:03:22] before I come back to it again later but
[1:03:24] what have he had a SP to it that's right
[1:03:26] just think about that okay but he didn't
[1:03:28] speak to it he smot it with his with his
[1:03:31] judgment Rod he hit twice and uh praise
[1:03:34] God uh he broke the scriptures and the
[1:03:37] scriptures cannot be broken Jesus said
[1:03:40] that amen the god of Glory said
[1:03:42] scripture cannot be broken come on and
[1:03:45] here was Moses breaking the scriptures
[1:03:48] amen by smiling that rock twice right
[1:03:51] and so Hallelujah we'll come back to
[1:03:53] that just in a while amen and then just
[1:03:57] to give you a little H H background of a
[1:04:00] May because and I know you've been
[1:04:02] through these wat you've been down these
[1:04:05] roads but I hope just something this
[1:04:07] morning will will bless your heart amen
[1:04:09] but uh praise God there is many rocks
[1:04:12] you know that uh brother dick was saying
[1:04:14] there this morning he likes some
[1:04:16] documentaries and even about Ireland and
[1:04:18] things like we do have a lovely country
[1:04:20] amen and uh I think there's one of the
[1:04:22] little TS is thinking of building a kind
[1:04:24] of a roof over itself so so there you go
[1:04:27] amen keep the reite amen they are turn I
[1:04:31] don't
[1:04:33] know but praise the Lord uh certainly
[1:04:36] the only thing about our country is that
[1:04:39] when Columbo was alive they reckoned
[1:04:40] there was 300 churches in Ireland right
[1:04:43] amen now there's only four actually you
[1:04:45] can nearly say five because uh just when
[1:04:47] I come home from uh when I come home
[1:04:50] from uh uh Vietnam and Thailand we had
[1:04:54] the pleasure of baptizing a
[1:04:56] and his wife they live in another County
[1:04:57] from us a couple of hours away and they
[1:05:00] come up as often as they can but he
[1:05:01] certainly got a good grip of the message
[1:05:03] and he had been baptized but you know
[1:05:06] not in the the way that the Acts of the
[1:05:08] Apostles that Peter preached on the day
[1:05:10] of Pentecost and we don't want to go
[1:05:11] into that you know it's the truth and
[1:05:13] that is the word of God Paul says let
[1:05:15] any man that teaches any other thing be
[1:05:17] a cursed so you can't it's the word of
[1:05:19] God Amen they don't have a a a
[1:05:21] revelation of the godhead and and that's
[1:05:24] the truth so we have and that makes it
[1:05:26] all a difference and he was I baptized
[1:05:28] him again and his wife in the name of
[1:05:29] the Lord Jesus Christ and that was a
[1:05:31] wonderful thing amen but there was a
[1:05:34] great rocks in the b in the world
[1:05:36] there's the rock of J seen with my own
[1:05:38] eyes and then I seen a a documentary one
[1:05:42] time on the euin I think it is ucin part
[1:05:45] is that what it is in California that's
[1:05:48] a massive granite rock it's massive you
[1:05:50] see and uh then of course in in
[1:05:52] Australia there's a rock there's great
[1:05:54] rocks in the Bible I if you look at the
[1:05:57] type of them the type is Christ amen
[1:06:00] there was a rock and horb I think the
[1:06:02] Jews actually believe the old fathers
[1:06:04] believe that this rock that Moses uh uh
[1:06:08] smoke at the beginning that they they
[1:06:10] they to it that around the Wilderness
[1:06:12] amen some believe that but I don't
[1:06:16] think but something do believe amen but
[1:06:20] the greatest spiritual Rock in the whole
[1:06:22] world today is Jesus Christ amen and
[1:06:25] certainly believe that don't we and amen
[1:06:28] and well there is none holy like the
[1:06:30] Lord just a little backr there none holy
[1:06:32] like the Lord for he is there's no Rock
[1:06:34] like our God Amen and we know that God
[1:06:38] put him in the Cliff of The Rock and let
[1:06:40] Moses see his glory amen also it says in
[1:06:43] Deuteronomy that uh he brought forth
[1:06:45] water out of a rock of Flint imagine
[1:06:48] that a rock of Flint just completely
[1:06:52] impossible to do it in the human thought
[1:06:55] and is it wonderful when you get away
[1:06:57] from the uh what God can or can't do
[1:07:00] it's wonderful to see him doing Miracles
[1:07:02] like that for you know he's valuable
[1:07:04] amen praise the Lord to speak the word
[1:07:07] and whatever he will say will come forth
[1:07:09] amen it's so wonderful hallelujah praise
[1:07:11] the Lord then of course it's it's always
[1:07:14] wonderful to make it personal that's
[1:07:17] what I would like to do this morning
[1:07:18] with you you know I know that the Lord
[1:07:21] is my rock brother and and many of you
[1:07:24] people have been coming here for years

[1:10:15] degree of of honesty and truth about
[1:10:17] that amen cuz you couldn't run a
[1:10:18] business if you weren't in control of it
[1:10:20] so there's a certain degree of honesty
[1:10:22] about it but sometimes when it comes to
[1:10:24] your life and you're trying to plan your
[1:10:26] life in your little boxes and squares
[1:10:28] you see and you're going to do this and
[1:10:30] you're going to do that and when you

[1:10:32] something all of a sudden you get one
[1:10:34] nasty joke right amen and then some
[1:10:38] circumstance Rises up where you are not
[1:10:42] in control right and you know amen
[1:10:44] you're not in control praise God like
[1:10:46] even say sister Peggy going for an
[1:10:48] operation you know you're not in control
[1:10:50] if you know what I mean there's nothing
[1:10:52] physically brother Samuel can do he
[1:10:54] can't go in there all the garments and
[1:10:55] say I'll take care of this amen you know
[1:10:58] you got to trust the the surgeon but
[1:11:01] ultimately our trust is in God and
[1:11:04] that's what it's for that we'll come to
[1:11:06] the place when we're not in control to
[1:11:08] say Lord thank God you're in control
[1:11:10] Hallelujah that's the wonderful thing
[1:11:12] about it because he's brought us out
[1:11:14] that clay and set us on a rock amen amen
[1:11:17] and it says uh when your heart is
[1:11:19] overwhelmed when your heart is
[1:11:21] overwhelmed when my heart is overwhelmed
[1:11:23] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[1:11:25] I now if I asked you this morning if I
[1:11:28] said is anybody here that's ever felt
[1:11:31] like you were just overwhelmed amen I'd

[1:11:35] going on Amen you know what I'm talking
[1:11:37] about I've been there too praise the
[1:11:39] Lord I've been there too overwhelmed

[1:11:44] forget the night when my wife went in
[1:11:46] the hospital and it was it was the the
[1:11:49] nurse in charge amen uh and and she said
[1:11:53] to me that that my my wife was going to
[1:11:55] die she told me that to my face she said
[1:11:57] she'll probably be dead in the morning

[1:12:02] being overwhelmed right what are you
[1:12:04] doing you're told that come on Amen what
[1:12:06] do you do but you see folks I tell you

[1:12:28] right
[1:12:30] amen but I'll tell you what but it's an
[1:12:32] overwhelming thing and the only thought
[1:12:35] that I could think when that lady said
[1:12:36] that the only thought that I could think
[1:12:38] was this God has not told me that come
[1:12:41] on and if she does die the Lord hit it
[1:12:44] from me right but she didn't die
[1:12:46] Hallelujah and the Lord brought her
[1:12:48] through so when your heart is

[1:20:02] country and then I said to her uh good
[1:20:05] Christ that girl had never heard that
[1:20:07] before I mean when I started to tell her
[1:20:09] about how the Lord was born sinless and
[1:20:12] spotless and and went to Calvary because
[1:20:14] we had sinned in that Garden amen and
[1:20:16] got to the resurrection I said that's
[1:20:18] Christianity and that poor girl was just
[1:20:20] dumbfounded she had never in her life
[1:20:22] heard that then the brothers ared
[1:20:25] and they give me a strange look but I
[1:20:26] says come on Brothers it's okay praise
[1:20:28] the Lord right here amen and I'll tell
[1:20:32] you what I said so you take her details
[1:20:34] you take her phone number and all that
[1:20:35] there but things like that happen when
[1:20:37] you're on the mission field and I tell
[1:20:39] you what that is wonderful praise the
[1:20:40] Lord anyway let's just move on here
[1:20:42] quickly and uh in the New Testament it's
[1:20:45] wonderful uh what greater wisdom could
[1:20:48] you have than to build your house upon a
[1:20:50] rock come on Amen you're not going to I
[1:20:52] know there's builders in here this
[1:20:53] morning and you're not going to to take
[1:20:55] some old uh uh place that's Sandy and
[1:20:58] has no Foundation you know some some
[1:21:01] Builders might do that you know and they
[1:21:03] disappear with the money but you know a
[1:21:05] real genuine Builder not going to do
[1:21:07] that you need a foundation amen and
[1:21:10] Jesus called you a wise man if you build
[1:21:13] your house upon a rock amen amen and we
[1:21:16] were
[1:21:17] studying about the home church I've got
[1:21:19] a little message at down in the motel uh
[1:21:21] we were studying on that where your
[1:21:25] Treasures that's where your heart will
[1:21:27] also be amen praise God that's why every
[1:21:30] day you come to the word why would you
[1:21:33] sit and read the word why would you sit
[1:21:35] there at the beginning of the day at the
[1:21:36] end of the day maybe during the day and
[1:21:38] just read a passage from the word and
[1:21:41] pray because that's where your heart is
[1:21:43] amen that's where your treasure is it's
[1:21:46] in Christ Hallelujah if I ask anybody
[1:21:49] here that really loves the Lord I know
[1:21:50] you do amen I wouldn't even insult you
[1:21:54] to say did you speak to the Lord this
[1:21:56] morning come on Amen because that's
[1:21:59] where your treasure is hallelujah you
[1:22:01] know this day is in his hands you pray
[1:22:04] about it and you're expecting his
[1:22:06] Blessing and he's going to take care of
[1:22:08] you so that is the truth that is
[1:22:09] wonderful amen so a wise man will build
[1:22:12] his house upon the rock amen and of
[1:22:14] course the foolish man will not do it
[1:22:17] and that is sad because lay up treasure
[1:22:20] in heaven where your Treasures are folks
[1:22:23] I cannot see it any other way when Jesus
[1:22:25] said if you give a cup of water in my
[1:22:28] name amen the blessing will come down
[1:22:30] how much more when you feed these
[1:22:32] pastors when you help them also I want
[1:22:34] to tell you that brother George Smith I
[1:22:36] met him for the first time in many years
[1:22:38] this trip I had breakfast with him in
[1:22:41] Tennessee and he is going to try uh and
[1:22:44] get us the uh the Vietnamese 7 Church
[1:22:48] ages and if I can get them into Vietnam

[1:22:53] get them in I will take them personally
[1:22:56] over myself to H them to the Impostors
[1:22:59] and say there's your study book amen
[1:23:01] there's your study book you use your
[1:23:02] Bible and use that book Hallelujah and
[1:23:05] you'll not be far wrong right so I'll
[1:23:07] tell you what so you pray with these
[1:23:08] things and it is wonderful amen okay
[1:23:12] there are other scriptures I'm going to
[1:23:14] H let them go but you know brother Bram
[1:23:16] said more in a million said everyone
[1:23:18] drank of that same spiritual Rock Amen
[1:23:21] every one of them amen and praise the
[1:23:23] Lord all them a people that had crossed
[1:23:25] the Red Sea and they at the Mana every
[1:23:28] one of them we were studying the
[1:23:30] Tabernacle have you I'm sure you've
[1:23:31] studied the Tabernacle over the years we
[1:23:34] had a just in Heavenly places when we
[1:23:36] studied that Tabernacle you know to
[1:23:39] think that Moses came down the mountain
[1:23:41] with the two tablets of stone right but
[1:23:43] that wasn't the only thing he came down
[1:23:44] with he came down with in his heart and
[1:23:47] in his mind right a whole plan for the
[1:23:49] Tabernacle of God God's chosen place of
[1:23:53] worship in that day right the only place
[1:23:55] where you could worship almighty God and
[1:23:57] knowing that we are Kings and Priests
[1:24:00] this morning that can go right into the
[1:24:03] Tabernacle not on the outer uh uh Court
[1:24:06] not even outside the outer court that
[1:24:09] where the world is seen so many people
[1:24:11] going to mow their grass today going to
[1:24:13] do their own thing today they're going
[1:24:14] to go up to Walmart and do their
[1:24:16] shopping and it's sad it's it's nothing
[1:24:19] to Rejoice about it's a sad thing that
[1:24:21] people would not put God first and come
[1:24:24] at least somewhere to even give him
[1:24:26] thanks and worship amen but here we are
[1:24:29] amen and so when he came down he had
[1:24:32] that and he made that and us as Kings
[1:24:35] and Priests today come right into the
[1:24:38] Tabernacle and folks you know I'm not
[1:24:40] I'm not going to go too too far into
[1:24:42] there but listen when you get into the
[1:24:44] Tabernacle you come to the showbread
[1:24:46] come on and the showbread was not made
[1:24:49] it wasn't the Angel's Heavenly food that
[1:24:51] came down outside it was only for
[1:24:54] priests amen and it was made of flow
[1:24:58] which is a type of Christ amen that pure
[1:25:00] flower and there was one for each of the
[1:25:03] tribes amen there was 12 of them all
[1:25:05] together and two Ros six or on top of
[1:25:07] one another whatever way they were LED
[1:25:08] out praise the Lord and that was the
[1:25:11] showbread amen and you know something
[1:25:14] that is what we are partaking of this
[1:25:16] morning amen amen it's the sh bread
[1:25:19] because we're Kings and Priests and
[1:25:20] we're actually in the Tabernacle this
[1:25:23] morning praise the Lord we've had prayer
[1:25:25] we're at the uncens of prayer we've got
[1:25:27] the show table Hallelujah we've got the
[1:25:30] light amen of the seven Church change
[1:25:32] Angels amen the light of our day and
[1:25:35] we're right in there praise God and
[1:25:38] there is no we'll touch it in a moment
[1:25:41] there is no middle wall of portation no
[1:25:43] Veil that we can go right into the holy
[1:25:45] of holies well certainly Moses had a
[1:25:47] baptism he did CU he said they were all
[1:25:49] baptized under Moses so if they were all
[1:25:51] baptized there then he had a baptism
[1:25:53] John the bap had a baptism he really did
[1:25:56] and we've got a baptism today praise the
[1:25:58] Lord as one of the things that brother
[1:26:01] Bram said that we were to uh excuse me
[1:26:03] uh to do amen baptism and the fruit
[1:26:06] washing and the Lord's Supper praise God
[1:26:09] wonderful and they drank that uh
[1:26:11] physically they drank from the rock

[1:26:20] life from God Amen and the things that
[1:26:22] they were doing though they were only
[1:26:23] doing the type yet God was blessing them
[1:26:27] amen with the blessing that he could
[1:26:28] give them in that day amen obviously it

[1:26:33] had to come to it the true Tabernacle
[1:26:34] which is Jesus Christ himself amen had
[1:26:37] to come but in their day that's what
[1:26:39] they were drinking and what they were
[1:26:40] doing that was the place that was God's
[1:26:42] chosen place of worship hallelujah amen
[1:26:45] and may I say this if I may please
[1:26:48] because if I miss some of this it
[1:26:49] doesn't really matter but just in my
[1:26:51] heart that you know uh there was a lever
[1:26:54] before you come into the
[1:26:56] Tabernacle before you should have come
[1:26:58] here this morning folks and uh uh really
[1:27:02] this is the water of the word the word
[1:27:06] is a washing thing this is the lever
[1:27:08] here this morning praise the Lord and
[1:27:11] the lever was made of all the mdors that
[1:27:15] the woman had brought out of Egypt now
[1:27:17] you're thinking well glass car could you
[1:27:19] make a but it wasn't glass it was it was

[1:27:26] faces amen and praise God and they
[1:27:29] brought that out of Egypt Hallelujah and
[1:27:31] so God said uh well get rid of the
[1:27:34] vanity and give them all over to Moses
[1:27:37] and he'll make a big lver and he'll fill
[1:27:38] it with water and you wash with that and

[1:28:14] what that's what they made the lever out

[1:28:21] easy to be defiled no you don't even
[1:28:24] have to defile yourself but you know

[1:28:55] I didn't want them to say that I didn't
[1:28:57] enjoy them saying that you see and you

[1:29:02] when you open the word or when the word
[1:29:05] is preached over you that it washes all
[1:29:07] that off you're washed but you are
[1:29:10] washed amen and I tell you what uh it's
[1:29:13] it's a wonderful thing to just let the

[1:29:45] one willing to be right but where would
[1:29:47] that put us today right amen and do you
[1:29:51] think that we could all go down to Hell
[1:29:53] and God would be in just he would not be
[1:29:56] injust he'd be as still as holy and
[1:29:59] righteous as he ever was cuz that's what
[1:30:02] we deserved right we deserved we were in
[1:30:05] the slave Camp of sin amen but thank God
[1:30:10] Amen that's what it means but he
[1:30:11] redeemed us right not with silver or
[1:30:14] gold but by his own precious blood
[1:30:17] Hallelujah when you think of all the
[1:30:20] millions of gallons of blood from bulls
[1:30:22] and goats amen and yet just what he said
[1:30:25] that day because it was the blood of God
[1:30:27] brother brandham says amen and just that
[1:30:30] little bit amen from his body is able to

[1:30:42] Living Waters amen praise the Lord okay
[1:30:46] and uh you know brother Bram just said
[1:30:49] this comment and I like it but I want to
[1:30:50] just go on he said that uh when out
[1:30:53] there in the desert imagine that they
[1:30:55] found this great Plan of Salvation yeah
[1:30:58] just think about that and uh brother
[1:31:00] Brown says in the most unlikely place
[1:31:02] and in the most unusual way that's what
[1:31:05] we've always had like Moses in the most
[1:31:07] unlikely place in the most unusual way
[1:31:10] never seen anything like it before and
[1:31:12] he wanted I was telling the people I was
[1:31:15] telling these people from aquador uh
[1:31:18] that when I was once in Nepal and I I I
[1:31:22] it was a lovely after afternoon and up
[1:31:25] in the little wooden houses you climbed
[1:31:27] up a little uh uh stair a little uh
[1:31:29] ladder and it got you to a second a
[1:31:32] second uh uh level and I was sitting in
[1:31:35] the door I was watching some of the
[1:31:36] children play and some people out in the
[1:31:38] fields it was a beautiful day and I
[1:31:41] decided to get up and I went around the
[1:31:44] side of the house and just kind of
[1:31:45] stretched and you know I looked up to
[1:31:47] the mountain and I saw something that I
[1:31:50] never saw before in my life there was a
[1:31:52] huge Cloud sitting right on top of that
[1:31:54] mountain and God is my judge folks I
[1:31:56] just bear with it there was a huge Cloud
[1:32:00] on the mountain and I looked and there
[1:32:02] was no other Cloud this massive white
[1:32:03] cloud and the mountain way back there
[1:32:06] and it was on the highest mountain but
[1:32:08] the thing that really struck me was that
[1:32:10] it was exactly the ship of
[1:32:13] Ireland exactly I couldn't believe it
[1:32:16] I'm going right around and I see the
[1:32:17] whole ship as a matter of fact if you
[1:32:19] look at our country you'll see that up
[1:32:21] in the top there is a r the middle up at
[1:32:24] the top there's a lock uh or a lake as
[1:32:28] you would call it here we call it a lock
[1:32:29] too and it's the biggest one in the
[1:32:32] United Kingdom and God is my judge I saw
[1:32:36] that blue in that cloud right there
[1:32:38] Hallelujah that day and I couldn't
[1:32:40] believe it as a matter of fact I I just
[1:32:42] staggered back when I looked at it and
[1:32:43] saw it and some of the brothers they
[1:32:46] they they saw me and they came rushing
[1:32:48] up they thought I got sick or something
[1:32:49] and I I went down and grabbed my my
[1:32:51] camera and I came back and I just took a
[1:32:53] a photograph of it where it was just
[1:32:55] moving because it was about 15,000 ft
[1:32:57] high and it was just moving off that
[1:32:59] mountain and uh you know in the unusual
[1:33:03] way uh it's God moves and what what
[1:33:07] happened was they said what is it
[1:33:09] brother I said I don't know I mean I I
[1:33:11] don't know but I but I saw it it was a
[1:33:13] ship of Ireland right down to the five
[1:33:15] little fingers at the bottom and that
[1:33:16] locked there and said I don't know and
[1:33:20] so when I come home now think about it
[1:33:23] when I come home whom the Lord give me
[1:33:25] the interpretation because we know that
[1:33:27] the voice of God speaks out of a cloud
[1:33:30] is that right right amen sure does
[1:33:32] hallelujah praise the Lord and it was
[1:33:35] the ship of Ireland the voice of God
[1:33:37] speaking out of a narish vessel amen and
[1:33:42] here we were in thep PA right on the on
[1:33:45] the on the roof of the world they call
[1:33:46] it and this highest mountain that's
[1:33:49] where it's at and that was the bride
[1:33:53] amen amen it wasn't the denomination
[1:33:55] Hallelujah God's Voice through any
[1:33:57] vessel would be to the bride in the day
[1:34:00] hour and that was the interpretation God
[1:34:02] Moves In A unlikely place in an unusual
[1:34:05] way what a comfort that was to me what a
[1:34:07] wonderful thing praise the lord well
[1:34:09] Amen Let us just go on so praise the

[1:42:53] they put it on the Limestone that the
[1:42:55] Sheep would lick it amen and just lick
[1:42:58] you know something folks today because
[1:43:00] we've all got a different capacity you
[1:43:02] know what I mean I would imagine that
[1:43:04] say some young person in here this
[1:43:06] morning and they've only known the Lord
[1:43:08] a short time you know well I wouldn't
[1:43:10] expect you to have the same capacity as
[1:43:12] your pastor with God Amen right but the
[1:43:15] fact is if you're filled your pastor's
[1:43:19] no more filled the capacity is greater
[1:43:21] but fill is filled amen whe it's a small
[1:43:24] cup big cup doesn't matter what it is
[1:43:26] but God wants to fill your cup this
[1:43:28] morning he wants to fill your cup
[1:43:30] Hallelujah and he wants you to lick the
[1:43:32] honey and it's true up in Carolina they
[1:43:35] always say you operate the gift you can
[1:43:37] pull it out you know do you know
[1:43:39] something I'm absolutely convinced of it
[1:43:42] praise God if you wanted a word from the
[1:43:44] Lord and you pull hard enough he would
[1:43:46] give it to you that's right amen right
[1:43:48] through these lips you say well do you
[1:43:49] really think God yes I do yes I do I
[1:43:51] believe it with all my heart can come
[1:43:53] right down and talk to you right in your

[1:43:58] and tell you maybe something that you're
[1:43:59] asking or seeking for amen well it's
[1:44:02] wonderful praise the Lord hallelujah the
[1:44:04] name of the Lord Jesus Christ is a is a
[1:44:07] mighty high tower and we've run into

[1:44:11] for new other name that's a name now
[1:44:14] could I just say this as we go on
[1:44:16] because there just a few little things I
[1:44:17] would like to say and then we'll we'll
[1:44:19] quck for the morning but uh you know I
[1:44:22] said earlier on you know in the most
[1:44:23] unusual places Charles Wesley was like
[1:44:27] all ministers you might think well
[1:44:30] brother Samuel he just brings the word
[1:44:31] every week and you know it's wonderful
[1:44:33] you don't realize how hard it is
[1:44:34] sometimes amen maybe with things coming
[1:44:37] on him from outside influences then he
[1:44:39] got to turn himself and turn his mind to
[1:44:41] seek the Lord for a message for the
[1:44:43] people maybe went away or something got
[1:44:44] to do it right and it's not easy and
[1:44:47] Charles Wesley was there one day in the
[1:44:48] shore and you know he was seeking
[1:44:51] inspiration from God that's what it was
[1:44:54] and well and I notice here uh there's
[1:44:57] little places over there you walk along
[1:44:59] this strip of sand and it was a Bluey
[1:45:02] day the white we call the white horses
[1:45:05] on the on the water you can see all the
[1:45:07] white waves blowing hard and the wind
[1:45:10] was blown hard so he had a cloak on and
[1:45:12] he ate it over him like that and he was
[1:45:14] walking along just praying for
[1:45:16] inspiration and all of a sudden just out
[1:45:18] of the blue this little thing went Z
[1:45:20] like that and he looked down and
[1:45:23] whatever way his coat had been blown
[1:45:25] this little bird had been literally
[1:45:26] blown in to his coat and there it was so
[1:45:31] the minute it get in there it settled
[1:45:33] itself down you know it just you know
[1:45:37] and he's looking in there and this the
[1:45:38] wind's blowing on him but it wasn't
[1:45:40] blown in the little bird anymore and
[1:45:41] he's looking in there do little bird fix
[1:45:43] his feathers and he can't just nice and
[1:45:45] comfortable and he looked at that little
[1:45:48] bird and it struck him Hallelujah right
[1:45:52] why should I fear right why should I
[1:45:55] worry Hallelujah that little bird he
[1:45:58] find safety here right and I can find
[1:46:01] safety there and he he paned that lovely

[1:55:42] standing there with Christ on the Mount
[1:55:46] of transfiguration amen as the brother
[1:55:48] said amen the prophets the uh preaching
[1:55:52] the word to the word amen about what's
[1:55:55] going to happen when he goes into
[1:55:57] Jerusalem amen and they're discussing it
[1:55:59] together and the prophets preaching the
[1:56:01] word sharing the word with the word of
[1:56:04] God himself it's wonderful now listen

[1:56:09] here in a second
[1:56:11] amen praise God
[1:56:14] Amen um bless
[1:56:17] you brother Bram says think of it n are
[1:56:21] you in a desert do you know where to go
[1:56:24] have you been got off the Beaten Track
[1:56:27] and that's easy to do I mean King David
[1:56:30] well maybe mention it today he had an
[1:56:33] anointing but he just didn't chn on it
[1:56:36] the right way you see praise God like I
[1:56:39] can go further into that than I did I
[1:56:42] mean Moses knew he was a prophet of God
[1:56:44] Moses knew if he hit that rock twice I
[1:56:46] would bring forth water right you see
[1:56:48] but he didn't channel the anointing
[1:56:50] right and that that that that's has to
[1:56:54] be correct and and it's the same with
[1:56:56] David E the anointing bring back the Ark
[1:56:59] of God you see he had the anointing but
[1:57:01] he just didn't Channel it that's why you
[1:57:03] got to watch you got to watch folks uh
[1:57:07] that that you don't be off a little side
[1:57:09] road amen see off the Beaten Track
[1:57:12] exactly you find yourself you know in
[1:57:14] the Pilgrim's Progress uh he was walking
[1:57:18] along and and this this is why sometimes
[1:57:21] we do it
[1:57:22] because in Pilgrim's Progress Pilgrim
[1:57:24] was walking along he was quite happy he
[1:57:26] had been to some place the house
[1:57:28] beautiful and they had looked after him
[1:57:30] well and I've been so looked after a
[1:57:31] while here and you know the thing is uh
[1:57:34] he thought that was great and he's
[1:57:35] refreshed again and he's marching along
[1:57:37] the road going to the celestial City
[1:57:39] then all of a sudden he well my Feet's
[1:57:42] hurting a little bit here you know and
[1:57:45] uh he thinking a fairly Rocky Old Road
[1:57:48] distance starting to cut his feet up a
[1:57:50] little bit you know and he's walking
[1:57:51] along and he looks over he said well I
[1:57:54] don't think I think I'll just take off
[1:57:55] I'll get off the road a little bit here
[1:57:57] you know so anyway what happened ameny
[1:58:01] the battery died okay God bless you amen
[1:58:05] okay thank you I should be dying with it
[1:58:08] here amen but but I will blow but you
[1:58:12] know there he he he he looked at that uh
[1:58:15] and he and he said that would be you
[1:58:18] know that would be easier on the feet
[1:58:20] amen so he got thank you very very
[1:58:22] much and so he got uh off the road he
[1:58:27] said that's an e oh this is far easier
[1:58:29] on the feet you know sometimes you you
[1:58:31] remember what what the holy spirit said
[1:58:33] to brother Bram and through the through
[1:58:35] the message and tongues and
[1:58:36] interpretation because thou chosen the
[1:58:38] hard way right amen this this is not an
[1:58:40] easy way we're going to heaven but it's
[1:58:42] the correct way it's the correct way
[1:58:44] that's the whole thing and so praise God
[1:58:47] that uh amen here he was there in this
[1:58:51] nice easier
[1:58:52] oh this is an easier walk oh yeah and
[1:58:54] then of course as he walked along it was
[1:58:56] easier and he got
[1:58:58] sleepy oh yes this is a nice comfortable
[1:59:01] Road got
[1:59:03] sleepy and I think I'll take a little
[1:59:06] nap and so he did and the next thing he
[1:59:09] felt was this on grabing him got you who
[1:59:13] are you who are you and it was the giant
[1:59:17] of doubting
[1:59:18] Castle I don't know if you know the
[1:59:20] story it was the Giant of dirty Castle
[1:59:23] so keep on the heart it don't it says if
[1:59:26] you maybe are feel that you're off on a
[1:59:28] little this is the prophet talking amen
[1:59:30] the beaten path amen just you pray God
[1:59:33] will keep you on the right path always
[1:59:35] but he said maybe you have maybe you
[1:59:37] felt like God he says why not speak to
[1:59:40] the Rock why not speak to the Rock he
[1:59:43] will bring forth his Waters amen and a a
