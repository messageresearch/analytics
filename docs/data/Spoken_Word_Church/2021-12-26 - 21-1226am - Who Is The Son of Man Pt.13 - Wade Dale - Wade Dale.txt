room in the end but it's pretty pretty full there is no room in the end i remember richard boy oh boy you have your seat for just a minute because i got some announcements i got to make brother collins coming in right there just give that to me um first thing i want to thank everybody for all the gifts cards letters prayers especially prayers for all of us during this year and the when we were down at the barn i want to thank you for all coming and being a part of our church um we forgot a couple of musicians which is just humanly possible because we're humanly people so we have uh two that we need to give out today we forgot nila sorry there and we forgot brother paul so if you'll come and get your i'll i'll bring yours we forgot him so god bless you buddy she's going you're going to school that's a good girl she's going to go to college that's her heart i got that thing filled out so who was it for was for her for chloe i thought it was i wouldn't write anything about whose name it was but chloe's going to go to a christian school so that's wonderful and uh paul frieda's right up here that's the girl you made right right freda brother raise your hand sister freda raise your hand there you go right there all right you can sit with somebody else if you want to but you probably need to sit with your wife um boy look what a silver dollar do for you oh lord i reckon no anyway that could be more sad but anyway all right now another announcement we got to get finished with all these so we can get started all right if you come to this church regularly and you pay tithe and you did not get a check cindy please tell brother terrance uh it would be the adults got two hundred dollars a piece the uh uh over 18 and under 18 the kids got 75 dollars so if you didn't get one there went again we're human beings we don't want to exclude anybody we just forget from year to year to year the church is growing the uh the musicians are growing uh the support is growing which is wonderful people are stepping up and i want to admonish um people like brother john dorette and and brother michael different ones filling in um to uh yes somebody's stepping in and filling in when a lot of people are gone and that does happen a few times of the year that most are gone and then there's some in the back i want to thank brother joe and brother anderson and them for cross training they got some young kids back there they've got some young adults back there that are and it takes a lot in that media room it takes three people pretty much to do to do what needs to be done to keep the internet running and to keep the quotes coming up and then we've got all this new system coming in that brother anderson and brother um richard are putting in for us so thank you for that also while you're seated just stay there pray for brother luis everybody's i know most of us are kind of keeping up with him he's doing a wonderful job uh souls are being saved um we've got churches that are being built uh food's being given to um communities with the money that y'all sent so what am i yes yes yes the play and the offerings and thank you everybody for doing what you do right it will not go unnoticed it may go unnoticed from him to a human being but it won't go unnoticed to god he knows every bit of it knows what's going on so just forgive our human mistakes right because we do make them but also remember this coming wednesday night there'll be no service this coming wednesday night everybody got that no service we will be having service friday night at eight o'clock i don't want you all to remember me on wednesday i'm going to have my psa checked again because it was high the last time so pray that we don't have to do anything but just say it's low all right amen and also remember on friday that will be from 8 to 12 on the 31st it's our normal regular watch night service brother chris long will be here with us if how many of you are planning on attending and i have a reason for this raise your hand all the way up so we can see because we usually last year we didn't bring finger food because of covid and and whatever but i just asked mom and pop and they said it would be fine for us to have this year have finger food so sisters you need to get together today after the service and find out what you're going to bring and then bring it and we're going to probably be here around 6 or 6 30 on friday evening they'll be just finger food don't come hungry like you're going to eat chicken and and potatoes and uh this is finger food okay come to get you some finger food and don't be chewing on fingers be eating some food all right but we did it a couple years ago and it's always worked out well we'll be here between 6 and 6 30. so sisters get together please and do that brother chris we'll be preaching about 8 30 and then afterwards we will have singing until midnight and then we'll be taking communion and that will be our communion for january so we won't have communion on january the 2nd which will be that same weekend all right this is all coming together uh in the same weekend and also january the 1st there'll be no bible study because that will be new year's day and we just had to service friday night and brother chris would be here both services but if you are going to sing a song you need to stay today we're we're not having a second service we'll be done here in a little while stay and practice your songs if we have a group song or whatever you need to see sister trudy and get with her and sister christine's not here so it's all on sister trudy so just bug her okay if you want to sing a song and sister esther has so graciously as she always does said she would stay and help practice and if some of you musicians want to do the same thing you can stay in practice for the watch night service because we'll have a good bit of singing that night until midnight take communion and then we'll again have finger food afterwards and then you can can go home all right january the 2nd brother chris will be here for both services so we'll have him friday night and sunday all right everybody okay with that everybody so far so good all right january 22nd we'll have our youth service starting at three o'clock brother darrell ward will be here we'll have one service that day and then on january the 23rd which will be that sunday

ever know could just be ink could be something else who knows but you need to get your cards they're back there on downstairs where the box is we're trying to get rid of all that and uh and get your gif get your christmas cards before you leave today for service now stand up now we'll start serving that's all right we are with church that don't want to sit still i don't want us i ever sit still i want us to be doing something amen and listen if we'll do it for the lord he'll give it back to you i promise he'll give it back to you if you do it unto the lord he'll give it back to you so let's um let's bow our heads let's remember sister janet and also remember uh brother jonathan's brother james orr used to come to church here a while back and his son comes and jonathan sent us a message a few days ago and said his dad was really really sick so we need to pray for brother orr too everybody most of you older ones know who brother lauria so and jonathan's his son so let's bow our heads probably where he's at today your heavenly father we ask you to be with us today lord we are human beings lord and we live in a world but lord you promised that we could live in the world and not be of the world you said we're a separated group of people lord you're the one that does the separating lord by the new birth lord we think different we walk different we talk different than the world because that's what happened when you came on earth lord you were so different that they called you everything in the book but god and lord i pray that you'd be with us today lord that we'll now be conformed into that image that you produced here on the earth as the son of man you gave us a guideline to go by lord and now today we pray that you will just be with us in the word that we speak that you'll be the active participant in the service lord heal the sick lord raise up the dead be with the ones lord that are dead in sin and trespass lord that you'll give them life father and bring them into the fold as our brother was singing there lord we pray that you'd just be with the ones that are not here lord by the oar be with him lord sister janet and the different ones that's been sick brother john duret and his family lord we pray that you just be with each one lord we miss them all when they're not here just part of the body lord i pray that you'll be with all of us lord take care of us and furthermore this service in jesus name we pray amen so if you have any other questions i'll redo that again if you need me to about everything going on just don't show up wednesday night show up friday night at 8 o'clock all right okay huh with food friday night with food all right sister trudy you know what the brain don't you just trudy um mcmillan you know what she brings that shrimp she brings that round thing to shrimp and it ain't for y'all it's for brother dale this brother now no it's i love it because she brings it every year but god bless you we love you with the love of the lord and thank you for all the things really you've done it's been a wonderful time i hope you had a good holiday yesterday and remember that uh we know jesus wasn't born on christmas but we can still remember the blessings that he give us every day of the year amen he blessed us and give us life and then he blessed us again by giving us eternal life amen so in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and life was the light of men the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not it was a man sent from god his name was john and what did john come to do he come to introduce the head that's what we're going to talk about today at the end of the service here we're going to once we get our background again we're going to talk about the headstone all right because that's what he was that's what he still is and there's a reason why he had to come back in the end time amen and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe and i think it's an honor today that we can stand here and read about john the baptist and know that there was an elijah number four that showed up right in our time that we can read about that he introduced the headstone to the to the church and that we can read this and know that john did it but see the same parallel as what we have here in the end time that's exactly what happened again god sent us a man named william branham with the spirit of elijah on him to do the same identical thing okay but now what he did is though he turned the hearts of the children to the fathers the babylon babies he turned them to the fathers all right and that was the difference in him and john john was turning the old the old testament fathers to the new testament church all right he was the he was the um the link and we had a pro need a prophet in the end time to do the same thing to link us together who link us in christ together not us and william branham together us in christ together because that's what john said and i'll read it to you maybe later on john says i must decrease that he may increase amen listen god's not going to share his glory with nobody amen and i don't want anybody to share it with me i want him to be my my owner my god my friend my lover my husband i want that's what i want him to be i don't want him to be anything different he came into his own in his own received him not but as many as received him to to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which are born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now let's read hebrews 10 5 wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice an offering thou would us not but a body yes hast thou prepared me now what does the body it has a head on it and the head is where the intelligence is if you don't have anything in your head it's not you're not going to have anything to do with your body because listen ephesians 5 23 says for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of that body and man we got to have jesus christ to save us because our body was rotten our body was born in sin shaping an iniquity espoused from our mother's womb but he gave us a chance to get out of that man you may be seated in the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word and colossians 1 15 i love this right here this let's read this one because we're going to make a few comments and then come back to it colossians 1 15. it says who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature now we're going to get into that in a minute in revelations 3 14. he was the beginning of the creation of god amen when god became flesh amen the book of psalms tells us heaven and earth has kissed they've come together they've met amen heaven came down heaven came down to earth and became flesh that's why i do love the christmas story we know it's not got anything to do with santa claus and even december the 25th we know that's not true but we know one thing's for sure he had to be born on a certain day there was a day he was born he was born a lamb in april we know that but we're into this in this world and i've never seen anybody that's complained about getting a gift on december 24th to 25th so amen that's what i thought so if you take a gift that's okay who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth now this is this man that we're going to we're talking about this son of man visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him all right and he is before all things and by him all things consist pretty powerful but watch though he brings it down he says and he is the head of the body the church knocked out there the bride he is the head of the body the bride who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead what listen it's okay that he was born a baby it's okay that he died at calvary but if he had not resurrected if he had not come out of that grave brother brown said that's when he proved who he was it's when he said you destroy this body in three days i'll raise it back up lazarus depended on jesus to resurrect him we're gonna have to depend on jesus to resurrect us but he didn't have to depend on nobody to resurrect him because he was the resurrection and i hope we get into that a little bit more later on in the year because when he stood and said i am the resurrection in life that is the ministry of the son of man i'm here i'm here to resurrect you i'm here to change you and i'm here to take you in the rapture amen everybody all right with that and he is before all things and by him all things consistent he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead then in all things he might have the preeminence that's what we need to work on that's why i'm telling you we need to let out what we got inside of us this year let it out start praising god run the aisles do what do something amen study the bible more read more pray more shout more amen this is okay this is all right but i promise you yesterday when y'all was opening some of your presents you didn't just go thanks rightly you're like wow that's what i've always wanted right oh you brought me this you bought me well you know what that rap gift i told you about he brought you a gift of eternal life amen and he unwrapped it and then he wrapped it back up in you amen because you and i are part of that headstone head we're the body that's why jesus can't come back until we connect with him here spiritually then we come back naturally in the millennium for him to be the head and that's to be the body but spiritually it's got to happen now because that's when we connect and there's many many quotes and we'll read them later on uh next year there's many many quotes that brother brown says the head and head and the body has to unite because what would be a person walking around with no head amen amen you wouldn't know where to go what to do you couldn't see everything comes from right here amen so we've got to have the headstone here or the head man the head person the head of the body the church that's why he had to come back in the end time because they rejected him and they've rejected him all down through time they sure rejected him when he was on earth but let's read let's continue on but he is the body he is the head of the body of the church who in the who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead he had to come in human flesh he had to die to give you eternal life that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell amen he wasn't part god he wasn't the second person of a trinity he wasn't even the first person of the trinity he is a triune being he was a father when he was in the old testament the son of god jesus told us that we worship in spirit and in truth in other words you'll find out who the father is if you'll start worshipping him spirit and in truth you'll find out who my father is and then he comes to philip one day and he says philip if you've seen me now listen he's a liar if there's a father somewhere else another person standing right he said if he's seen me you've seen the father i am the father expressed in the son of man that's why the son of man is me and you that's what are me in you where the father expressed yes because we're sons and daughters of god so we are the father of stress that's why i say we we take we take the lord jesus and we bottle him up and say boy that's the son of man and he's the fullness of the godhead body and he's this and he's that and he's the other well now what'd he do did he leave it there no he came back on the day of pentecost and he poured it out into believers amen not mate believers not unbelievers but true believers yes right for it please the father that in him should all fullest dwell now let's read the first quote we've been reading it for a while but i want you to understand that jesus only came according to the word so you and i can come only according to the word that's why if your wife you're listening and watching this screen when brother branham is preaching on the 70 weeks of daniel he brings it straight out of the bible he says there's three distinct periods and there is three distinct periods in the bible a 62 a seven and one one not any halves everybody got that you see what people people have said this and that and the other and he said well i got a quote it can't it's got to match the bible everything has to match the bible because that's where jesus came out of so if so if brother brown is going to introduce the full headship there can't be one word missing you can't can't resurrect part that's why this fourth elijah had to restore all things and we'll read it too in a minute because brother brown told i mean jesus told him said this elijah will come and restore all things amen i thank god he sent us a prophet because we'd just be we'd be floundering around wouldn't know what we were doing folks think about that i want you to think about that and the world's deceived with denominational ideas that ain't even in the bible but it's their tradition jesus told them one day said your tradition is killing you because your tradition is not what i'm looking for i'm looking for my word to be made manifest word by word by word because i brought it to you and i gave it to you in plain english remember that's what i was telling you the other day and it's what i was telling brother richard hyatt there's no need to get into argument with anybody about the word of god but when they say well we can cut our hair well tell me where you can do that in the bible i can read plain english that said you sisters are not supposed to cut your hair out of the bible not out of a william branham book he didn't bring us a new way to live he come to tell us what god already has said in the bible there's nothing that we live by that we can't take to the bible what about your religion what about your denominational idea what about any of your ideas sitting in this building today same way with like daniel 70 weeks they got all this you know about well there's only three and a half years left after the rapture well the bible doesn't say that the prophet of god is fixing to tell you in just a few minutes tomorrow whenever we play this again he's fixing to tell you that there's one week left after the rapture because the bible says so i mean good grief people come on we're either going to believe this message all the way or we're not going to we're going to stay here you're going to believe it all the way or you're going to stay here because you know too much you've heard you've listened you know all of us i'm talking about all of us if we leave if we stay here we are the ones that did it don't blame god and don't even blame the devil you better blame yourself amen because we've been given the word of god we've been given every i means like the old colored brother says from giver to giver from kenner to kevin we've got the bible and it's been open to us like i said before jesus opened the book that day and read where he was supposed to be to do these things we'll read it in a minute then he closed it back up and he handed it back to the people but he was the open book he was the one we were looking for that that what he might have the preeminence in what in himself no in the church in his body in his bride he don't want a bride that's slopping around with the world he don't want a bride that's not a virgin a man let's read the masterpiece right here the body was built read the red built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it all jesus came on the scene then when this head piece was put upon it we find in him the entire handiwork of god because the bible tells us in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bother which is what father son and holy ghost we believe in those titles but they're titles to one person not different personalities we don't have a schizophrenic god no he's one person but he can do just like i did yesterday i portrayed myself yesterday as a father because some of my children came home with me some didn't sitting in the back waving because of other things that we'll not get into but anyway no but i portrayed when i woke up though but when i woke up yesterday morning let's just be honest i was in bed with my wife and i was a husband right but now that don't happen with the children but when i moved over into the role of father i displayed it to my kids then my grand girl showed up he's back there waving so i moved over into what the role of grandpa god fulfilled jehovah father of everything creator of heaven and earth but that same man moved over into the sun and became the son of man same person but he had a different title amen then he moved over on the day of pentecost and he came as the holy ghost right same person same person same attribute but he moved over into the form of the holy ghost so he could come inside of me and you if not he's got two bodies he's standing here as the son of man and if he moved over on the day of pentecost and he stayed here as a human stayed here he couldn't fulfill the word because it couldn't come back into me and you'd have two bodies here and that would make him a trinitarian but it's not it's one god with one personality with one ultimate goal and that was to create a group of people that would worship him for an eternity and be intimate with him for an eternity not just something that's waning video love wanes it goes back and forth up and down you know i love my wife and then i don't like her too much today and you know and there's some things god don't like that we do but we're still his wife amen right we may get some weapons every once why not lo don't whip your wife don't don't do that but he can whip us because he whips us with nail scarred hands he whips us with the word of god and it is hot up here too uh well aaron's not here brother is that is the uh fan on see if the fan's on because everybody's fanning and i'm getting a little warm all the way down there you go okay all right we'll just suffer through it nobody falls asleep but the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it all jesus came on the scene that's when this headpiece was put upon it now what was the head piece the baby the son of man when that when that produced when the prophets produced a flesh the word was made flesh and dwelt among us that's when it produced that's when the the prophets that's why when jesus stood there and just like what we do we we stand we stand in the world and i think we're odd and we're crazy we're different praise god praise god the bible never tells you to act like the world never tells you to act like the world it says you're going to be in the world but not of the world i want them to know i'm different i want them to know i'm a little crazy but i want them to come and tell me what in what my belief is not in the bible and what their belief is not in the bible i want them to talk to me about that not about well y'all believe this prophet and he's this we have prophets all over the place that was prophets in the in the new testament agaves and different ones that were that were prophets that you didn't hear anything about but they were prophets god spoke through them so what's the difference now you know why it's like i said before when you got james dobson and all the different ones max lucado and all they write some good stuff okay but they didn't bring me a word to change my body they didn't bring me the headstone they didn't bring me the head of the church the intelligence of the church because the intelligence of the church will point you right back to the bible and say this is what i've already said not what i'm going to say this is what i've already said right here face final resting place the prophet said is in the word of god the word of god and that's what we believe because remember jesus was the word he was not a piece of the word he didn't come to be part of the word he was the fullness of the word everything he did reflected the word and everything he did reflected what me and you're supposed to do why do you think paul and peter could write the rest of the new testament because of matthew mark luke and john because of the commentary and the ones that were there with them already peter james john were there now paul wasn't but paul by revelation that's why paul says i was one born out of due time but i got the same understanding that you got it's a little rough when brother bob you you take paul and you take peter and they come from way too different avenues of getting to be christianity you know this is an old rough fisherman that kirsten was naked most of the time okay let's just be real and he always wanted to fight i'm fisherman i always want to fight so he's even right up to the garden he wanted to fight we're going to take his place over jesus we're going to take over jesus looked at him and said sorry that's not for you to do but then you got paul well learned scholared he said i was reading them yesterday in the in my uh bible study i was reading where paul said a pharisee of the pharisees according to the law he was blameless blameless peter didn't fit that peter didn't fit that spot paul persecuted christians paul was scholared and learned he knew what he was talking about but when the holy ghost came on peter and the holy ghost came on paul same person when they come together they were preaching the same thing now most of us come from different walks of life and i'm talking about ministry and everything else but us being the way we are now in the message of the hour how can you bring one over here with this one over here and bring them together and you're preaching the exact same thing very very few not common to do that why because satan has gone into just like he got in all the other denominations and divided everything he's divided everything up but listen somebody has got to produce this headstone and i'm just saying it's us amen i'm just saying it's me and you we have a chance to do that [Applause] some people will never have a chance to do what you can do and what we're going to do [Music] which was the prophets and here comes the head of it all like i was saying you got the max locators you got the this one you got that one you got jensen franklin you got all these different ones good good guys good i say chris nominal christian men but they don't bring a message to change your body something's off that's why they don't like when you when you say their name is okay but when you say william brown's name they go why because he came different he brought the word 100 percent they didn't they brought part of the body that's okay they had their time but we're under the ministry of the son of man which what he wasn't like god he was god amen i don't want to be like god and i know we sing that song to be like jesus well that's okay be nice but if you don't have them inside of you you can interpret that your own way you ask people outside you say are you a christian yeah i'm a christian have me a beer you know their opinion of christianity is not our opinion of christianity in our opinion see listen folks we're not living under an opinion that's right listen to me jesus was not a good opinion he was the word total when you pick this book up you pick up the son of man you pick up what he did on earth 2 000 years ago as god almighty in human flesh and when we read it we read about that man that never will change we can't change him to match us we have to change us i thought the bible said we're changed into his image amen so what is his image not the worldly image that most people produce come on people he was so different as the son of man he walked on this earth so different the denominations hated him they wanted to kill him you know what if it hadn't been for that anointing for him to preach that message for three and a half years they probably would have killed him amen but remember the anointing left him in the garden so he could die so they could kill him and they got what they wanted they wanted that man out of the way they just didn't know that on the day of pentecost here come 120 of them people that they killed one for and then 3 000 came that they were trying to kill that one for and now millions of people christians in the world that are producing jesus christ that's what we're supposed to do not produce a man but it took a man to come here to preach that gospel to us because we were so messed up listen every time you look in the bible every time man started getting off i'm talking about the old testament every time man started getting off and getting away from the law getting away from this god sent them a messenger right even ezra nehemiah all those different ones you watch god sent them in a pivotal time of israel's journey career whatever you want to say look at moses critical time they were in captivity they were getting old they were wanting to get in the promised land so god sent them a prophet they wanted to leave as daniel 70 wheat so tell you they were getting ready to leave and go out of captivity well where do we go well how do we get there god sends them ezra god sends them nehemiah god sends them all these different prophets to what line them back up same thing folks in the new testament god sent us a prophet to line this thing back up to get us in the right way you say oh this is tough listen you get the baptism of the holy ghost it is not tough to live this life the reason you can't live this life is you don't have the holy ghost i'm just going to let the rubber meet the road today okay that all right because in revelation 3 14 this is to the angel of the church of the laodicea and so now that's us right this is to the messenger right pull it up there um be revelation 3 14. and to the angel of the church of the layout of sins now angel messenger right so that would be our seventh angel messenger which we know for surety who that is and god sent him to us what the church of the laodiceans these things saith the amen the faithful true witness the beginning of the creation of god do you know now listen don't get me wrong they had the new birth down through the old down through the church ages everybody got that yes but they didn't get the fullness i read you that when we were talking about eternal redemption they got just enough to get saved just enough to get sanctified just enough to get the holy ghost and say i'm a christian and give their life for the gospel and all the different things but the beginning of the creation of god we know that happened 2000 years ago but listen the continuation of that creation did not fully come until the seals broke boy that brought it way on up here did it y'all thought i was gonna say on the day of pentecost partly the way it did that was the building of the body but now when we come to laodicea it says the beginning of the creation of god that now jesus christ is back in human form again in a bride because of the angel that brought us a message amen it's okay to have all these other messengers that's fine but this one did two things remember turn the hearts of the children back to the pentecostal fathers what the bible but you know what he would stand there and condemn women preachers and condemn women for cutting their hair and condemn women women from wearing paint and you know what that's been 60-something years ago they did one denomination and go out of business they're still here they didn't i mean sure they some people were converted but they just kept going brother brown even said he he said y'all just get worse every year right i'm talking about those supposed to be the epitome the the the head at the time you understand what i mean the pentecostal church was supposed to be the cleanest living and the closest living the holiness the closest living to god he said in 20 years he said you'll be worse than the catholic church took 2 000 years because they thought they had it and they didn't they thought they had the latter rain they thought they had the headstones they thought the lord was coming they thought they were the church that the lord was going to come to and brother brown said no he said you've not even had your teaching green yet and that's what's been going on we've had a good teaching rain going on but now there's going to be a harvest folks you know what you don't leave your harvest why how would you why would you put forth an effort to plant 10 rows of green beans or tomatoes and then just never go back to it what's going to happen that fruit is going to rot die on the vine good fruit hey good fruit good beans good tomatoes and like me and lisa it's hard for a good tomato to go bad in our place because we eat them too much we eat them now sister june she might throw them out but that's okay but think about what i'm saying is god planted it and he's going to have a harvest there's going to be a harvest of a ripe fruit call the bride and there's going to be a harvest not just growing it out and saying oh that's beautiful that's pretty like the pentecost they shouted it out they said oh this is it this is it this is it then they said the evidence of the holy ghost is speaking in tongues and they shut the door they put god out because in revelation 3 14 on down to 16 or 17 what'd you say behold i stand at the door or not that was the son of man trying to get back in see we've got to let the son of man back in our door for us to take a body change that may be hard for somebody to to listen to but everything you know down here has a time limit i was thinking about this everything has a time limit when you play a basketball game you got every how many minutes you play a football game you got four quarters 15 minutes a quarter right there is an end to the game okay there is an end to the first quarter there is an end to the second quarter when that clock goes zero zero zero they stop the game that's the same way with god when he give us a gentile dispensation he sent us a prophet he sent us the word of god he sent us an absolute wonderful fivefold ministry to bring the word of god and break it down to the people somewhere that clock's gonna hit zero zero zero zero the game's gonna be over and somebody wins and somebody loses amen if you're with god you always win revelation 3 14 talks about the beginning of the creation of god listen to this quote god's gift always finds her places number two and he was a being on earth a being of time which means that he must have had a beginning therefore he created himself a body to live in now how'd he create it he created it by the word i just read he created it by the prophets in the old testament that created the body for him to stand up stand out on behold a virgin shall conceive that opened a door so that could happen because it can't happen otherwise amen god himself created a body for himself see that by this creation he might save the lost creation that he created thank god look at number three the loudest in church age now show that he was the first he was the beginning of the creation of god oh do you catch it see how could god be created if he's a spirit how could he be he's he's eternal he never was created he never will be created because he was god at the beginning but he that is the beginning of the creation of god was jesus christ when he was made manifest the father stepped over into the sonship and became a baby god crying in a cradle god with no teeth god having to have a diaper change that's the kind of god i like he come down here and dwell right here with us and he was not untouchable folks this is what he's trying to tell you through the ministry he is not untouchable he wants to be held he wants to be i say used he wants to be he wants us to use his word he wants us to use what he said i think the bible talks about exercise exercise your faith what does that mean no exercise exercise your faith say be it unto me according to thy word listen to a preacher and stand up one day and say there ain't nothing but the truth preacher and see what will happen amen when god created himself a body he came down and lived in it that's the beginning of the creation of god what that's the beginning that we see that we can understand and relate to that god so eternal listen created everything i was watching a little show on youtube yesterday about the uh the um uh glaciers up in alaska and different ones that are hundreds of miles long so many miles deep of ice you know god knows every ice crystal is in that whole thing much less how many trees is on this earth already i'm talking about the whole earth how much water by volume is already here where it came from because he created it all but listen he decided to begin as a baby he decided to clean that womb out not by sexual desire but clean the womb out by creation that's why it was the beginning of the creation of god and we're a continuation i'll finally get to that quote one day where you and i are a continuation of that creation because if it had to be a beginning listen there will be an end to a gentile dispensation they'll be the last gentiles saved and no other gentiles are going to be saved like filled with the holy ghost do you ever understand that the clock will be zero zero zero zero on the gentile dispensation now that doesn't mean it ends he just takes his game to the jews and you know what they get 1260 on their clock come on somebody they get 1260 days and when that thing hits zero they're gone according to the bible what are you saying brother wade listen it's good to say well we got four quarters we're just in the first quarter we'll just we'll just kind of halfway get through this thing but boy in that fourth quarter we're going to really no yeah you better start now because listen he started right when he was the beginning of the creation of god he started the right way he wanted to start a virgin birth and me and you by the new birth listen by our old birth we were not virgin born that's right i promise you if you were born from your mama she wasn't a virgin everybody got that but god said you must be born again born from above born by creation not by well we'll read it here in just a minute how could god be created if he's a spirit only a prophet could tell us he never was created because he was god at the beginning but because of the word because of the word he was the beginning of the creation of god so that was jesus christ in the womb of a virgin that came on earth and lived and we saw all that we know in luke 20 luke 2 verse 49 he said i must be about my father's business not building cabinets but preaching the word of god amen so let's just keep going uh abby you're gonna have to slide through these pretty quick and sister abby's right back there learning how to do that got real sweaty palms probably but that's okay just keep scrolling that thing up hebrews 5 and 8 said though he were a son he learned obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect you say well jesus wasn't perfect his body was not perfect his human body that he decided to live in to give his life to give that listen you can't kill the son of god that's god and you didn't kill jesus they didn't kill jesus he acted the part of death we know that listen you and i act a part of death even if we have to put them in the ground it's an act because if you're born again you're more alive you're more alive when you pass from this world see that's another thing that we don't understand you're more alive there than you are here cause you got this whole thing hanging on what's the song says i'll drop this i'll drop this robe of flesh just peel this thing off step over into another dimension then you know what we're going to step back in this dimension with more power than you had in the first time and you're going to change that body you was living in huh yeah you pick up a little power when you what did jesus say he never said all power in heaven earth has been given unto me until he come to the resurrection he stood there and he said now all power in other words i have control over this body i can walk through that wall if i want to i can eat if i want to i can ascend if i want to and i can come back on the day of pentecost if i want to and we know he did because that's what the word said he was going to do all right it's all because of the word then we know he had to go and be baptized he saw a spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting on him in matthew 3 verse 16 a little voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and that's what he says it's your new birth you have to come to a river jordan experience you have to come to a place where god says i'm pleased to dwell in that listen he said i'm pleased to dwell now i'm going to start building yeah yeah now i'm going to start building now i'm going to use you because remember justification is the work of the holy ghost but it's not putting you in service that's bob was saying the other night you know brother brown says to stand behind this sacred desk you need to have have an experience with god now you don't have to go out in the backside of the desert he meant like moses did but you got to have an experience yes like moses did because justification is a work of the holy spirit just chopping off your past sin sanctification god is going to let you do some things right right because it's set aside for service but when you get the holy ghost it puts you in service now see then you get all the full blessings sure in sanctification you get blessings too but listen you're not even bribed by that time sanctification doesn't put you in brideship it puts your name on the book as a believer it puts you in a religious order am i quoting the prophet it puts you it drives out the unclean spirit according to luke drives out the unclean spirit but when he fills you with something he seals that thing in and when he seals it in he can't get out and the devil can't get in now that's putting you in service that's washing the whole glass where you can fill it up and drink out of it amen so that's what that's what we see that many times people don't go on to the baptism of the holy ghost they get the sanctification they get it half time they get the half time of their religious game and they say well we're up 42 to nothing live we're fine no game ain't over you still got time on the clock amen still gotta play the game listen folks this is not a game it's an example but this is not a game this is not a game that listen if you lose loser gets i ain't gonna say losers don't get a trophy like most they do now and end time everybody gets the trophy even if you just show up no listen folks not with god you don't get a trophy just for showing up you get a crown by being born again you get the blessings of god by being born again by giving your life to god totally and completely let him have the preeminence and see that's one thing we all need to work on because i know i'm standing here behind this behind this desk i don't give him all the preeminence that i should you don't either we're trying we're trying to get there we're moving but we're not there yet we're still but we're trying we're striving to let him have preeminence yes because jesus never got up one day he said i think i'll try to do what my daddy says today i'm going to try he says i do always do what my father tells me to do he was so in touch with that one inside of him until he knew what to do do me and you we're supposed to have the mind of christ we're supposed to have the holy ghost in our soul same person same man that's why we're talking about we'll talk about the characteristics maybe a little bit later on not in this this sermon but john 1 verse 32 says i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said to me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remain on him see we can have an anointing and it can go off of us but he says who you see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizes with the holy ghost you know i think god's let this thing go this long for us to prove who we are 60-something years and even after everybody said oh 1977 was going to be it 1977 we're way past 1977. we're 40-something years past that so why are we still here preeminence and we're not born again because when the last born-again person comes in the door shut yes so let's be sure this year let's make sure that we're sure that we're sure that you have the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul not just an anointing it's good to have anointings good for anointing to fall on us but boy go back and read anointed ones at the end time that one sermon probably rattled me more than any sermon has ever rattled me as well you see that how close that thing is but it took a profit to bring us that to what make us aware that there will be false christ now listen he didn't write a new page in the bible matthew 24 tells us they will come in the end time false teachers false christ false anointed ones you've got to figure out which one that is but remember the holy ghost will never fight against the holy ghost amen it'll never fight against each other now we might have qualms and and you know quirks and stuff of of humanity but when it comes down to the word of god there's only one and there's not any not an opinion remember what brother dale i always said if you come up to me and say i think i stop you right there or i thought no no we don't have a talk coming it's the word of god or nothing and this year i want us to see that all right so luke 4 verse 16. let's go to there abby and that's when he opened the book because see everything that jesus did was a was a symbol or an example of what we're supposed to do right all right hang with me just a few minutes don't go to sleep listen y'all hadn't even eat for a while and shouldn't be the carbs getting a hold of you hey man and you didn't get here until 10 30 or 11 o'clock so you should have slept an extra hour yes bob said yes because he's not sleeping but look so jesus goes into the end of the temple all right let's make this example jesus went into the temple as was look as was his custom jesus went to church as was his custom he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for the read now why didn't they deliver him the old trusted pharisees sadducees whatever was in the church service why didn't they open the book and say here read what my denomination says or or read what my idea says no the bible says they handed it to him closed he chose to read that because look he found the place where it was written amen he didn't just open it up and go oh i think i'll read this right here and all he found what pertained to him standing and i'm sure brother branham said that was the greatest anointing that ever struck the earth ever struck the earth not jumping up and shouting not running the walls or running the aisles he was sitting in the church standing in the church and he opened the book and identified who he was he found the place where it was written he found the place he was the word listen you got to find your place an open book you find your place the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me i'm not pointing at me i'm talking about jesus is saying he pointed me now that was written close to at least 2 000 years before jesus came on earth isaiah wrote that right and now he's fulfilling exactly what the scripture says the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath appointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me look at look at the identification he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recover of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord he could have read the rest of that because remember the rest of that scripture is pertaining to his second coming and there's only a comma there it's not even a new it's not even a new paragraph or even a new scripture it's the same scripture he's reading he just stopped why because he was a word he knew where to start it and he knew where to stop it amen so what did he do he rolled it back up and handed it to the preacher and sat down and the eyes of all them were a synagogue were fastened upon him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears how many how many really realize that they didn't realize that but every time you come to a church service every time you do listen to the prophet's message every time you do listen to a sermon this day this scripture has been fulfilled in your ears hears faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god but really are we really listening are we really listening is it coming from here down to here because look this is where you think yes let me read you the bible as a man thinketh in his heart so is he this thing can get all muddled up this is where the greatest battles ever fought but listen if you're born again it ain't the battle down here it's the battle up here amen but if you're born again remember it's sealed your filter is up here let it come down to here that's our problem we're not letting it come down but this day can you say that this day this scripture is fulfilled we know that that jesus talked to nicodemus and there was a conversation he told him said you must be born again you must be born from above you must be born not of yama again all right so now let's go to and that was uh jesus's first doctrine that should be our first doctrine what did brother bryan tell us he said i am i am certain i think what he said he said i am certain we're not getting them to christ we're getting them to a tradition we're getting them to where we can just say well you can do whatever you want to do you can you you're a christian no you can't do whatever you want to do and it's not do's and don'ts listen jim and i were talking coming up here today we were talking about buying a camper and take it to illinois and use it while we're up there so she can go with me and you know there's men that stays in the in the big place that we stay but i'd like for her to go she said well we won't be able to use it except maybe during the week you see where that mentality is we know what we're doing on the weekend we know we can't get in now listen if you want to take a camper and go out for a weekend that's fine but i'm talking about every weekend it's sunday i have a job and i love my job i want to be here i don't want to be sitting in a camper on sunday afternoon or sunday morning but see that's what i give up and you know what i don't give it up begrudgingly lord knows my heart i don't give it up and say well i can't buy that camper because we can't go off on the weekends because we got a goat chair now if you do that you're not a christian there's something pulling you more than god is pulling you if you buy a camper well there was a brother one time and i'm not gonna call his name a lot of you know who he is brother one time he got this idea i said idea he got this idea that if he would work on sunday he'd get paid triple time but he would give all that money to mission work and he said god gave him a job amen he lied god didn't give him a job now listen if you have to work on study to do different things but i'm talking about he said he was going to do it every sunday stayed out of church for two years but he sent that money to mission work well he wasn't very successful he's had problems ever since so you see what i mean your motive and objective if your motive is is to buy a camper so that you can go hunting and fishing on the weekend or camping on the weekend then you're wrong but you see the mentality that you should have see put god first then he'll make everything turn out right he'll make everything go the right way amen he'll have to because he said seek ye first the kingdom of heaven but see that's the mentality that we have versus the mentality of the world they say oh we bought a brand new camper i think we'll take it out and we'll i will be gone a couple of sundays it'd be okay a couple sundays a month it won't hurt anything what you saying brother wade if you do anything begrudgingly shame on you if you do anything begrudgingly if you say man i can't do that because i gotta go to church or i i sure would love to go i ain't gonna say walmart i hope nobody loves to go to walmart huh bass pro shop yeah thanks brother boyd i don't even go there anymore but if you're making an excuse to do something you and i don't know where this is going but i it's still okay our motive and objective as we come brother brown says as we come closer to the headstone our motive and objective should be more toward god than anything else i know listen you got families you got jobs you got things you ought to do but just to sit home because it's convenient to watch it on the internet just because it's convenient to watch it on the internet now if i have anything to do about it if you do anything like that you ain't get no silver dollar man just kidding but what was jesus's motive and objective to die to save your soul to preach three and a half years that's my whole point to preach he didn't come to say well he did one time say okay disciples we're a little tired let's go off and take a vacation for a little while remember that's in the bible let's go away for a little while and that's okay because he was a human being that's what i told luis i said you need to take some time off you're still a human being you're going to wear your body down and the devil's going to jump on you so he's he's looking good now he's walk you see that one where he walked like five miles up this mountain road i mean he was sweating just a little bit and he said i'm glad the kids didn't come yeah he'd be carrying him that's what he was he'd be taking he'd be taking zoey and carrying her up that mountain but he's doing a good job god will bless him because he put god first so you put god first in everything kids everything everything you do you put god first because you know what that's what jesus did even though he was god almighty and human flesh he put god first i do nothing [Music] but what the father tells me to do now listen he didn't have this voice telling him to get up like a alarm clock get get up get up at seven o'clock in the morning eat your wheaties no it's the pertinent things in life the things he was saying the things he was speaking the words he was saying were what'd he say my words are life wow wow and then paul steps up after jesus is gone and come back into into paul paul stands up one day and says you're going to be judged by what i say if an angel from heaven comes and brings any other gospel any other than what i've spoken to you let it be accursed and he said it twice just to make sure we understood that god was speaking through paul oh well that's great that was paul we talk about william brown what about me and you what about me and you if god's anointed us to speak the word of god that's god talking to you amen and we should stay behind this sacred desk i only say what the father tells me to say now anywhere else we're human we're way more human than than jesus was amen because we have a spirit that's a little bit you know his spirit could be his spirit could be um talked to but satan couldn't get a hold of him because he was born he was not born with a carnal mind you and i are so what i'm saying is we don't need to be we can't be you know god zombies no but we must put him first in everything put him first in everything because jesus put god first in everything listen he could have done a lot of things listen he could have risen up for the for the signs and wonders that he did he was well known brother branham 50 000 people in a service couldn't get them under a tent because of the healing campaign because of the healing part but when he started saying i and my father are one when jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father he got a little closer he said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you'll have no part with me what happened it was like they pulled the drain plug out of the human bowl they left him there was only 12 left and he turned around one day and said you're going to leave too right are you going to leave too you've got to eat my flesh and drink my blood or you'll have no bite with me we know what he was talking about but remember some walked away and never walked with him again turned god down because they didn't understand what he was saying can that happen to us do we turn god down because we don't understand what he's saying let's don't turn him down let's just say god help me understand what that man's saying help me understand what brother dale said help me understand what brother bob said help me understand what's going on because you promised me you would do that you promised me you would take care of me if i'd put you first so put him first and then what act on it say god i'm putting you first so now let's go to matthew 17 verse 8 and then we'll be finished right here musicians get ready we haven't talked much about the headstone but we've been talking about in the whole service matthew 17 verse 8 when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man say jesus only thank goodness as they came down from the mountain jesus charged him saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead now six months later he was the son of man standing there was going to die but he said risen again from the dead somebody killed him they didn't kill him physically he only died physically one time but you can kill they killed him spiritually down through the church ages his disciples they're saying when then say the scribes that are lost must first come right and jesus answered and said unto them elish truly shall first come and restore all things that's our promise of malachi 4. john the baptist did not restore all things he just introduced the head right he did not restore them back to the headstone he introduced the headstone and then what did man do man cut him off yes man right because let's look in psalms 118 verse 21 it says i will praise thee for those for thou has heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refused is become the headstone of the corner this is the lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes look in ephesians 2 verse 19 it says now therefore ye are no more strangers than foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets you got to be built on the foundation of apostles and prophets wow jesus christ though himself being the chief cornerstone because he remember the headstone was rejected the headstone right here was rejected so it's not there but he became the chief cornerstone the foundation oh zerubbabel what a great mountain is going to be built but you got to start at the bottom crying grace grace unto it so he took him they didn't do away with him folks he just hid himself down here in the church ages he hit himself with a as the cornerstone because remember the cornerstone makes everything square if that cornerstone's out of out of alignment you're not square and man but that thing had to be that's why brother brown said anybody can build a straight wall he said it takes a profit or a master skilled builder to turn that corner and start a new wall amen and that's what we had as aruba yes to not make a new foundation listen this is our foundation and what was built on top of that matched the foundation all right let's read this and then we'll then we'll close and we'll bring this out again later built upon the foundation of the possible process jesus christ being the chief cornerstone look in whom all the buildings fitly framed together that's me and you groweth unto a holy temple in the lord in whom you also are building together for inhabitation of god have you ever asked god god inhabit this i know it's thinking it's filthy it's rotten it has bad thoughts but could you just inhabit this vessel yes i can ask that for y'all but you got to ask it for yourself god would you inhabit this you know what he's going to do he's going to say okay you need to clean it up a little bit because i won't dwell in an unclean vessel according to my word amen so i said all this um talk about this you know this seed being in us you can say whatever you want to you were born in sin your soul was black because you can't change the bible i know what brother brown is bringing out we have representation from god we know that our representation was the seed word of god not a seed that was put inside of you to make you different no god god's not a respecter of persons he's not going to dwell in an unclean vessel and i was unclean until god saved my soul so were you everybody was first peter 2 verse 5 says ye also as lively stones or built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable god by jesus christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be what confounded jesus when he was on earth he confounded the scholars when the prophet of god came on the earth and started preaching the pure message of god it confounded the scholarly people of the world amen amen so guess what we have to do the same thing we have to confound people can't understand why we live the way we live but like i said before it's not a have to if you think you have to do this you're wrong you're wrong it's like june always said you know her family said she's been brainwashed i said hallelujah hallelujah all of us need that i don't want to remember what i did in the past brainwashed means you wipe everything off by the new birth it's been wiped off you have been brainwashed amen and then washed by the water of the word and then he puts his mind in but they said why do you not cut your hair it looks like it and see everybody goes to that they go oh you look so miserable i may have told you that it looks y'all look so miserable you ain't got no makeup you know and you can't do this because you got your face all painted up like this to make it look like something ain't and and like brother brown said i hate listen i'm telling you i'm being honest you look at some people out in the world and you go yeah thanks sister then you go without all that what would that look like but i like natural beauty men and women in this church i'm telling you you're naturally beautiful you're just beautiful to god you're beautiful to brother dale he's espoused us to jesus christ and listen i don't think brother dale's ashamed of presenting us to god i think he's done a good job to get us to a place to where we can be presentable to god which is your reasonable service what's the bible i'll read it to you next sunday that's your reasonable service it's to present yourself a sacrifice it is and listen it is a sacrifice but you know what i thank god i don't have to walk into in the bathroom in the morning and go who is that where she puts all that stuff on and you don't have to spend thousands of dollars on max factor and all that stuff thank goodness buy hunting clothes with it or something you know but but june yeah well i wasn't gonna say pans or pots because you wouldn't like that either so but you got to cook but jim's family says oh you must be so sad having to do what you do have to jim told him one time she said let me tell you something she said if jesus christ could hang on a cross for three hours with nails in his hand and his feet beat like hamburger meat they didn't just barely put that crown on top of his head folks they probably pounded it on his head with some leather they beat him with a catalan tails to where his ribs show and then after he got all that they stuck a spear in his side jim said if he can do that for me me having to do my hair and have this shameful face she said that's nothing compared to what he did for me she said it's just part of what i want to give back to him that i want to be what a sacrifice which is your reasonable service see if we live that way and think of it as not a burden you get god in your soul it'll never be a burden because you know what you're doing what the word says see there can't be a conflict there they can be a conflict when one of them's not the word and one is the word but you can't be a conflict when the word talks to the word like i said when jesus talked to the father and talked to the one inside of him there was no conflict nowhere in the bible he said well i don't know if i won't do that or not no he said i always do that what the father said even when he was it when he was at gethsemane he said father if it be possible let it pass for me but he knew it wasn't possible he knew what he'd have to do he said but nevertheless thy will be done magicians get ready to come behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same has made the head of the corner now watch a stone of stumbling jesus was a stumbling stone to people when he was on earth amen a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word that's the stumbling part they stumble at the word of god being disobedient where unto also they were appointed some people are appointed to disobedience that's why the word's there is to keep us obedient musicians come on that word's there to keep us obedient and yeah sometimes we are sheep and go astray as brother michael was saying i love that song sometimes we do go astray but you know what the chief shepherd goes and gets us and he may have to break our leg every once in a while to keep us from running off again amen we may have to go through trials and tribulations and all the different things that that but you know what if you're a believer if you're a christian you got to go back to the bible that says i'll not put on any more than you can take and boy we think we get right up to the edge of it too but he said i'll never put no more on you than you can take sister jeff norma jefferies asked me one time you know her husband died pretty young brother junior we were at the funeral home and she said bro wait why'd god do this to me i said well i don't know that god did that to you sister noma i said but you know what i said god knew you could handle it if you're a child of god god knew you could handle it sister jim may not handle it if i passed away i mean really understand what i'm saying he knew you could handle it but it was time for that person to go but he knew you could handle it and look at sister norma now she's got grandkids all over the place she's just as you know just as sweet as she can be so so it's just things that happen in life and we just have to accept what god got for us and accept that it was for our goodness sometimes a little chastening you know to get us back in line that's what we need so let's stand our feet god bless you we love you with the love of the lord just think about what jesus did he sat there that day and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears i'm telling you what the bible said about me believest thou this yes let's believe the lord this year let's believe more let's let's let's let's go up that statue of a perfect man let's bring the headstone back listen the headstone of the word is here the headstone of the word is here we just got to receive it that's right amen let's sing a song [Music] with

amen [Music] amen god bless you yes sister sure yeah right there hey man um i just want to give this quick testimony and um also shine the light on how the brother was bringing out how beautiful you sisters are and and men too in a manly way but it is so refreshing um just coming out of the world you said that right you're good just coming out of the world you know like i was a vessel of dishonor for a long time you know i i went out on god and manchester turned my back on him in so many different ways i don't even deserve to be here right now standing right here i feel unworthy right but um i remember even being out there and i used to wear makeup a lot not like it is today where it's packed on like cake on top of cake and cake but i used to wear it and i was a slave to it and without it i felt i didn't like who i was without it so the devil got a way of putting it on you where you feel right brother you don't feel good without it because that's his way of doing it but anyway i feel i feel so free to not wear it and you sisters are so beautiful when i got here it was like man they you guys are so beautiful that's right yes and even the men out there appreciate you guys whether you know it or not i don't know about the ones that are trapped into this beauty but it's men that actually appreciate women for being natural right you know yeah and every now and then and you guys probably experience it too you have a man just come up to you naturally and say you're so beautiful and you can tell if they mean it from a uh perverted way or not you can tell right but some men really appreciate you for being beautiful plains because they really are sick of it they're sick of it you know it's kind of like um you you see women with these tight pants on and you're almost sick of it because everybody got them on from young to old from babies to older women you know you're sick of it but um i'm saying that to say this um i have a customer that i go to maybe twice a week and i have to be in this house to do the job that i do i do cleaning so um he's a very nice guy and everything but every now and then he would um it'll roll off his tongue like um beautiful he'll say that more than my name like you know um hey beautiful or hey beautiful this beautiful that so i kind of got it wasn't bothering me at first but it started to bother me after a while like man i got to correct this guy and then get him to call me by my name you know there you go so um i worked myself up and um i sent out a voicemail i didn't send it to him but i recorded my voicemail and um i was thinking about how i'm going to say it how i'm going to approach it how am i going to say it and um i recorded it and stopped it and said let me say it this way let me put it that way right now i'm going through all this so um i was like man okay the next time i visit him i'll try to sit and talk with him just let him know i'd rather him use my name um so anyway um that same week i got to his house and i was working in one of the back rooms and he came back there he was like your name is rebecca right he knew my name but he was like your name rebecca right i said yeah he said you know what i really like your name i'm gonna start using it because it was a rebecca in my life and i really respected her and she was a very nice person and it was like i'm gonna start using your name from now on i was like thank you god i didn't have to say anything so you know it was like i just wanted to share that there you go god is so good you're trying to act like i'm something or somebody and i i'm just encouraging anybody if you have a testimony that god did just share it because you never know that's right god is so good yeah he just come in sometimes you ain't got to do anything here take care of it for you that's it that's right amen amen but a testimony always starts with a test t-e-s-t is the first four letters of testimony amen so god bless you we love you with the love of the lord
