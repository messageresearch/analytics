Exodus chapter 23 three and then Proverbs 16 and uh want to look at a little thought tonight I uh thought I was going to go in a different direction and uh then things kind of just felt led to go this way so uh change your plans and uh just follow the leading of the Lord so amen uh whatever the Lord has for us we just just try to be um open open and obedient to the to the leading of the Lord so before we read the scripture tonight let's just all bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for this day Lord we thank you for your blessings on us and Lord we just never want to count it as common Lord for us to have a opportunity to be in your house and Lord Lord to Fellowship around you Lord because Lord you said where two or three are gathered in my name I'm there in the midst and father we just so thankful Lord for this time Lord that we know there's many that they don't have this opportunity and Lord it's a it's a real struggle for them lord it's uh even in a dangerous situation for

all your blessings on us that you've allowed us to come and Lord and just Lord we can't thank you enough we just pray that you bless the service tonight Lord just give me the words to say Lord you

just thank you and just pray for the bride around the world Lord there's many Lord laboring and Lord we just our hearts and our minds are always with them and Lord the labor That Goes Forth but Lord you said your word wouldn't return to your Void but it would accomplish what what it was sent to do and Lord we've seen the Miracles take place Lord we've seen all the things that have that's happened and Lord it if it would never happen if it wasn't for you and Lord we just commit ourselves into your hand Lord bless the ones that are sick the afflicted ones that can't be here Lord we just want you to watch over and and bless them Lord raise them up Lord we commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Exodus chapter 23 and this is called in his favor and uh Exodus 23: 20 says behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries for mine Angel shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the amorites and the Hittites and the perizzites and the Canaanites and the hivites and the jebusites and I will cut them off amen so we're just and then we'll go to Proverbs 16 and verse 15 one one reading the scripture there it says in the light of the king's countenance is life and his and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain amen God bless you you may be seated this evening and uh I just want to look at this thought tonight in his favor and the word favor has many means uh approval it means support it means or or liking for someone or something it means to Delight or take pleasure in in an act of kindness Beyond which which what is due or usual so favor and I want to look at a few things tonight and um the in the scripture you know when we begin to read um we'll see how uh the word grace and favor are used kind of interchangeably and um even even when we speak of favor you know we we see as uh as a uh interchangeable word you know we know that the word Grace means unmar favor unmerited favor of God and you know and brother bram's uh there in uh um invisible Union I believe it is where he talks about you know before the foundation of the world he gave us the wedding band of unmar Grace and you know talking about all the things but um if you've been reading in the uh in the church age book I know brother Wade's been going through this and um where where a kind of got this idea from is from the this morning church age brother Brandon was speaking he says he that hath an near let him hear what the spirit say to the churches of each age he said in every age it was the same cry hear what the spirit says he said if you are a Christian you will get back to what the spirit is teaching he said that is the word of this age he said every Messenger to every age will preach that word he said every fresh and true Revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age he said the Cry of every age is the rebuke you have left the word of God repent and come back to the word he said from the first book of the Bible Genesis to the last book Revelation there is only one reason for God's displeasure leaving the word and there is only one remedy to regain his favor back to the word so I want to I want to look at this tonight being in his favor and you know we look at the word grace and you know when we see the word Grace Grace brother Ram said Grace is what God did for us and you know you you look at this um and we won't look at a few things but you know Grace is what brings you to a place it's the grace of God that through you know because he said we are saved by grace through faith we're saved not of Works lest anyone should boast we know that it's Grace that brings us to a place because it's just like when you are brought to a brought it's God calling you into salvation calling you into the kingdom of God it's his grace that reaches out to you and brother bham said you know Grace is what he did for you but he said its works is what you do in appreciation so when we look about Grace but see having God's favor is something a little bit different well we kind of use it a little interchangeably but I want to look at this tonight because when you see this and you look at the even in the like the children of Israel when you look at you look at the life of the children of Israel just because they got out of the plan of God didn't mean that they weren't God's people God still didn't didn't mean that God done away with the plan and the purpose that he had for them the the mission that he had for them the commission that was given to them but they were out of fellowship and they had and they had to face consequences because they were out of their position so so the um the it would be um Grace is what brings you to a place so it's just like bringing you in into the kingdom as sons and daughters but favor is the condition of the relationship that you're in because even even as you know being parents we have uh we're we're parents and we have children well you know what just because they do wrong that don't mean that they're not our children even when we do God even do wrong that doesn't mean we're not not children of God God doesn't do away with us but he said because we we do wrong because we get out of the plan of God we do the things that are that are not pleasing to him then but then we face the consequences of it then we're chastised so we Face these things but see um you see the these things so it has to do with the condition of the relationship that you're that you're in and this is from this is from the the message of Grace and brother B speaking of love and grace and he said he said think of it love and grace is sisters twin sisters he said you can't have Grace without having love they're twin sisters he said that's exactly right he said before you can have Grace you have to have love he said before you can actually show somebody a favor you love them right or wrong you have to love them anyhow or you can't so if you're going to if you're going to show favor to them if you're going to do that see then you have to have Grace to cover them whether whether you're going to do that because he said love but you have to love them to have that Grace for them and he said if you can't have that then you can't you can't show Grace to people and that's what that because he said God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so that's what was given to us he said we can't he said we can't see one without the other he said love and grace is the same thing he said God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son he shed his grace abroad in our hearts through the Holy Ghost see there's nothing you can do without working one with the other Grace the grace of God this is what saves us so here we are when we're talking about God's grace to us is bringing us in but when we have this Fellowship when we have this relationship then what do we do and appreciation or how do how do we handle that uh relationship is it shows how where we are and how how we plan to grow and how we plan to change because you know it's just like you know you uh you you do everything for your children and you you you to the young people tonight and you know I mean you have children and and you want the best for them and you try to get them everything that that you can and you try to tell them ahead of time of what's going to take place and what they need to do and the and the pitfalls and all the things but you know what they have to they have to experience that for themselves you have you have to let them go and you know what you can't I mean sometimes you know you you want to light a fire under them to get them to move but sometimes you know the problem is is you can't tie them down because in certain areas of their life they won't do nothing right and in other ways you got them where they're doing too much or they're they're getting into other areas and it's like you know you're trying to re them back on this because you know because they they're getting because they're into this time in their life where they're wanting to go out and they're wanting to experience things and they want to have they want to they want to know it for themselves well the problem is is you got to be careful about how you approach things because Satan will get in the details and next thing you know you get into certain situations that you don't want to ever being and you then you're allowing the Devil to start working in situations and all you can do is tell them and pray and and apply the token over them that they will walk the right way that God will show them because that's what it takes but you can you know when they're younger you can correct them and do different things but when they get a little bit older you know um you don't know what to do sometimes I mean I got I got two boys I love to death but sometimes but you know the thing is is what what what what what was that are y'all talking about something okay they're joking over here about stuff same yeah okay yes we uh I tell I'll tell a little story I tell I tell tell stories except on me uh Richard Richard said I like tell stories on everybody else but I don't like to tell stories on myself and I told Richard like I've told Richard before if you ever preach you can talk you can tell stories on me but until then you know what you'll just have to tell people in person but you know we we used to go we used to go eat at Cracker Barrel with uh Donnie and Susan and uh they used they used to say that uh brother Donnie was uh one of the other kids hand to watch out for too cuz we don't we don't we don't know if he was getting dragged Along by the kids or he was D dragging the boys along Susan would have to get on to him think more than we had to get on the boys but they had but they had a good time you know but you know all of the things but you you look at things in your life and you see the things that you've went through and you see the struggles and you've seen the heartaches that You' faced and all you do is you try to tell somebody that you don't want them to go through those same things you try you try to stop them and you know I really appreciate somebody that can stand up here like brother Wade was talking about brother John coming up here and and giving his testimony and showing all the struggles that he's been through him and sister Alicia and all the things that they've had to face and all the heartaches you know it's been a real struggle but you know what God has brought them through I mean that's a real blessing to see what God has done for them and it's like well you know I I struggle with this and I struggle with that but you know what you I've never ever ever in my life and all the things I've been through I have yet to find a time when I'm looking and I'm searching I get down and you know I I can't tell you any time in my life where I hadn't seen a witness where God has come through and brought people through the exact same thing and you know because you know if God because God wants you to know that there's some if he's real then there's always been somebody that he's brought through the exact same well I'm I'm out here on an island by myself and I I'm facing this and and you know what and there's people that's come the same road that you have has faced the same Devils that you have fought and you know what and they have overcome you know even even ones that people think is just uh just you know amazing and and if if you don't mind I I want to share this and I was thinking about this the other day and you know this woman his sister she had she had these children and her husband had run off and and left her and left her left her with all these kids and she trying to figure out and she just you know struggling and scraping by just trying to make a living but you know what she was faithful to the house of God she was faithful to the word now now now God don't wouldn't I mean God's not going to do this for everybody I mean because you know the SI situations that happened but you know she went she she struggled she went through all this went through all the heartache trying to raise kids and everything like that and you know after she went through all of that you know God took her husband off the scene but you know what she didn't she didn't try to get out of her place or do anything like that she just tried she just tried to live the best Christian Life that she could and and all of a sudden God brought her a husband that helped her with the children was able to support her she had a great home life and all this kind of stuff and you know what but she didn't give up on God she didn't know how things were going to take place but you know what she just kept on going because you know what God said that he would always be her provider but you know what you know and it's not going then that won't happen for everybody but the thing is that she made up her mind the first thing she made up her mind that she was going to seek the kingdom of God in his righteousness and all of the other things would be added unto her she wouldn't worry about those things because you know what she knew that God would be her husband God would be her provider and you know all she had to do was put her trust in that now there was a lot of times that she went through a lot of heartaches and a lot of loneliness but you know what she could stand up and say God brought me through and so there's so many how many people have have been at at death's door and we we see how many people that God is touching they say well you know I struggle with this and and I have this problem and you know this is rare or whatever but you know what God Specializes in things thought impossible when it gets to the place where you think well I I'm not ever going to be able to get over this I'm not going to be because you know there's only a few cases of this disease in all of the world well then guess what God is the one that came and spoke everything into existence and then you know what he said every everything in motion and every devil in hell is bound by his power he he only permits these things to take place everything works according to his will everything works according to his word so if there's only two or three then guess what then you're the one that has the opportunity has the power to overcome it to show that the devil because you have the power right to cause the healing to take place in your body you know brother Brown was I was listening to brother Brown the other day and he was and he was talking about the prayer lines and you know he said you know and talking about Jesus said and and and uh the scripture he said you know that he said the son can do nothing of himself except what he seeth the father do that doeth the son likewise so he was only showing what God was seeing that God showed him that's what he done and he was talking about being in the prayer lines you know what God shows him he said I can only tell you but anything else he said I can just tell you what the word says but if he shows me something I'll tell you what what he showed me because he said he said if you're healed and I see that you're well then guess what you're well but I I Ain come up here and pray for you but I can't heal you but he said you have the same opportunity when you come in the prayer line and you stand there he said you had the same opportunity just like the woman with the issue of blood did when she came up there and she didn't have no scripture she didn't have anything but she had in purposed in her heart she had the thought she had she came to this place that she said if I can but Touch the Hem of His Garment I'll be made whole and that's exactly what she done and he said if you come up here and believe see that's all you got to do when you come up here then if you come up here to get prayed for then all you got to do is believe then you know what then all these other people have come through there and God has healed all of them and look at all the Miracles that's taking place when you come up there you got the same opportunity he's right here to meet your need am and he said you know you don't need me to do that God placed the gift in my life brother Brandon said you God placed the gift in my life but you know what I've got to get you to believe if you will believe because he said Jesus Christ is the Healer so if you can believe what he said he's the one that has the answer he's the one that's the deliverer if you will put your trust in him and believe what he said then you can have whatever you have need of I just want to I here I want to read these scriptures right quick just got a couple of them Psalms 11:27 it says he that diligently seeketh good procureth favor but he that seeketh Mischief it shall come unto him so if you diligently seek good you procureth favor so as you seek good if what is good the word if you're seeking God if you're diligent because he said he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so if you you must believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so if you're seeking God then you know what you procureth favor from God then you receive the favor of God Psalms 12:2 says a good man obtaineth favor of the Lord but a wicked but a man of wicked devices will he condemn so you see that if you do a certain thing then you gain the favor of the Lord then there's a positive that comes out of it but if you don't then there's a negative that comes out of it so there's something that takes place because that is what we do then it's based on what we do in Proverbs 3 verse 1-4 it says my son forget not my law but let th thine heart keep my Commandments for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee let not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart so shalt thou found favor and good understanding in the sight of God in man so these different scriptures that we can read in the scripture because it tells us if we want the favor of God if we want to be in his favor then there's things that we can do to be that to get in that and he was saying see the word is if you will get into the word and you will follow the word then these things will take place and this is from the this is from the message testimony brother R speaking and he's and he's getting ready to pray and there I believe he's getting ready to do the the prayer line and he was and he says and he said and May in speaking May great signs and wonders Break Forth and may this whole audience Break Forth forth for that Living Water springing up like geysers out of the soul lord that you told this Samaritan woman about and may we lay our tired weary Souls at your feet tonight and drink until we P bathe in the beauty of God until we forget all about this sense bound existence and move out yonder into a place where the Spheres beyond the stars where we can find favor with God find healing for our bodies and rest for our souls so there's a place that we can go to because all we've got to do is press into him and because he's here tonight and if we gathered here tonight then whatever you have need of then he's here to meet your need tonight so he's here and he said see then we can come in and we can drink and and bathe in this in the beauty of God that we can and and just as as brother Wade was speaking the the other day and he was talking about you know what he said I come out here and he said the whole place look milky well you know if if that happened once you know then then why can't it happen again that that the whole place just becomes so full of faith that it looks so you see the presence of God moving in the place that he becomes visible among us see that that is not just something that happens one time and you're like oh that was wonderful you know what we can have that all the time you can see that more often instead of just having it happen one time see but if we come in here and it's like well let let's just get Beyond brother ra says get beyond our sense bound existence why because you know we come in it's like well it's just going to be brother Aon up here and he's just going to he's just going to read some quotes and he's just going to say a few things or whatever but you know if it's just that then you know what then you'll walk out of here defeated you'll come out of here just sad you'll just go right back out the same way you came in but you know if we ever come in the door and we say you know what I'm going to meet with the with the God of all creation with with Elohim with with the one that created all things and and put everything into existence and he's the one that came and spoke to me in my lowest point in the darkest dungeon of sin he come and called me out and brought me into Marvelous Light and he's brought me to this place and he's delivered me and you know what if he's brought me to this place and guess what he will continue to lead me and if he's done it one time then praise God he's got more for you amen and it doesn't it doesn't matter who the you know who the person is that's preaching you know it's we got to get Beyond just human uh you know or just you know personalities and things like that because you know we'll allow those things to get in our way and it'll hinder our growth it'll hinder our experience with God and we wonder why we can't go beyond a certain point while we're while we stay at a certain and get in a certain rad because we've allowed things that the devil to play in you know it's so it's so it's it's terrible to see you know some well you know I I you know I don't want to fellowship with that person and you know I don't listen to that person or anything like that and it's like you know maybe just maybe if we get beyond the point and I'm not I'm not speaking to anybody here or anything like that but you know there there's times you see people uh you know people they go to church and and y'all know I'm just I'm just I'm just telling what I'm just telling the truth I ain't pointing no fingers nothing but you know there's people that go to church and they go to churches and you know what and they want they walk out a different door than some somebody else cuz they don't want to have to shake their hand but we you know we're we're ready to go into Rapture and what kind what kind of what kind of spirit is that and we wonder we wonder why the the why the church can't grow why the church can't advance and it's like you know just like brother randam said you know they said well brother R teach teach these great spiritual gifts and let let's let's preach on these great wonderful things and let's open the doctrines and and let let's preach these things where and he's like well how can I preach these things to people he said if they won't learn their ABCs he said if you can't if you can't love one another he said he said how you know if you can't how you love God if you can't love your brother how can you love him that you've not seen if you can't love the one that you have seen amen if we can't love one another with all our faults and failures and realize you know what I got faults and figures too and you know what I want you to make it and I want you to overcome what you've got but you know I don't want to stand in your way and if I stand in your way and if I'm your hindrance then you let me know amen then I'll come and apologize to you I'll apologize up here it don't matter to me if I get out of line then I don't mind doing that and I have before and you know but why because it's if if if I if I have this test if it if it's in my heart then you know what I'm I want everybody to know Hey listen I've got a problem and I don't mind I don't mind standing up here and being corrected by it because you know some people will stand up and and they don't mind pointing the finger at people but if you say anything to them then you know they get all upset and get been out of shape about things right and you know what then the church and the church can't grow the church can't be productive the church is is not going to get to the place that it needs to be because it'll you're hindering it but see the thing is is do we want do we want God's favor see brother BR says here he says seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness he said then these other things will be added he said I'm happy for that he said we all want to find all the favor with God that we can find because we need all the grace that he can bestow upon us we need all that we can get from God I want all of his I want all of his favor I want everything that he can get but I want to go in the direction that God calls me to go and you know here in the in the scripture we we see you know brother Brown was speaking and uh several different different places he covers this but he was talking about Cain and Abel when they come out of the garden and you know here they are they come out of the the garden and they they know that they they can't go back into the garden because they've been cast out and you know there's a way and they have a desire to go back and because they they know that they want brother said they wanted God's favor because they wanted to go back to where they came from because there was a there was a because there was a Chasm between them and God you know and he said he said because they knew that where they were at and he said he said they knew that they were mortal and they were dying and and they were under this burden he said they desired to go back to God and they were working their way back to that and he said you know and because they knew where they came from he said they wanted to worship God because they knew that they had to get back to God and that's how they could get back to God was to worship him and so you know they had this desire and here they go back to worship God and you know here they they go in there and they want to set up the Altar and worship God and and make their sacrifices and everything and you know brother Bram said that Kan wasn't an Infidel you know he was a real believer he had he was a Believer you know he just didn't come in there and say well I'm just going to do this no he really had it in his heart brother R said that they wanted to go to God and he really wanted to get to that place and you know but see he he wanted to do that he wanted to find Grace and he built his Altar and and he came to worship and all these things and he done all but the problem was he did not have a revelation and we know that Abel had a revelation and you know that he what what to do God give him that revelation of what to do and that's what Abel done he went in there and done those things and began to worship see brother says he said I believe Kain come with a full heart thinking he was doing right he said he see he was trying to find favor with God he was trying to find life again he was trying to get back to the Garden of Eden where the cherubims was see he said all he said I'm going to find favor with God he said I believe God he said I want to find favor with God so he was doing all these things but without a revelation the only thing that he could see was bringing the best that his uh labors would bring all of his tools all the things that he knew how to do that's all he knew how to bring to God but you God told him said no that won't be accepted but you know he gave Abel a revelation because Abel was by election Abel was selected and he give him the Revelation that it was going to take blood and so he brought he brought the uh lamb up there bring dragging this lamb up there and here he is bringing this lamb and comes up there and and you know no doubt Cain is standing there trying to figure out what in the world are you doing and so here he is he's bringing this lamb and and he's taking this knife or rock or whatever it is and you know he's up there and he's you know going at this Lamb's neck and he's trying to kill it and and cutting it and just continually just pounding on this thing and you can imagine him just standing there trying to cut that Lamb's neck trying to get that the blood out of that thing and he's just pounding away just why because he wanted to get to the he knew what God required and he was going to do that and Cain standing there looking at it trying to figure out what in the world are you doing that don't make sense at all but you know what Abel went through with that and no doubt Abel and Cain talked I mean I don't think it was just like that they you know coming right out of the blue but it still it never could it never could get in in Cain's mind he never could comprehend that but you know he went out there and Abel slew that lamb and you know made the sacrifice and he went out there and he began to worship God and you know he wanted God's favor and you know he wanted to re get back in in fellowship with God and he wanted to do what God wanted him to do and and Cain standing there and in that whole midst of all that and he was standing there and couldn't figure out why all that was going on but you know God told Cain he came to Cain and he told him he said listen he said if you will go and do those things he said if you will go and do the exact same thing as your brother he said that's all you have to do he said brother Ram says he said now the only way that that boy could have ever done that talking about C uh Abel see he knew that he was the right sacrifice it had to be a spiritual Revelation from God he said it's it's been every since spirit it's been every since spiritual TR revealed truth right how God in his Mercy through the operation of the Holy Spirit reveals spiritual truth the word itself he said if you're trying to read it from some educational standpoint you just read it like you're trying to re figure out mathematically something but if you read it after but if you read it after you received Christ in your heart it's a brand new book again it's a love story God writing to you it's spiritually revealed amen he said God's church is absolutely a spiritual revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ he said and no man can receive it by his own desire no man can come to me except my father draws him first see it takes the Holy Spirit to bring you to that place and he said he said he that comes to God by the Holy Spirit draw Jesus said I will in no wise cast out see you have to follow what God has led you to amen you know here's here's Abel he didn't have anybody verbally speak to him but obviously Abel probably did speak to him but we know that you know he heard what God had told him he by the Revelation that God had given Abel done what God wanted him to do but here he is when he sees this taking place and he realizes that God has accepted Abel's sacrifice and God comes and tells Cain listen all you've got to do is like your brother and you can be accepted too he made the he give him the opportunity he's looking for the favor of God and there's the opportunity for him to do that but because he wouldn't do that well you know I don't I don't want to I don't want to do that I I just don't see that being necessary I I I I I assume I feel that my uh sacrifice should be accepted I think this suffice but that's not what God told him God told him said listen you need to do this right and you've seen it take place and you've seen you've seen the favor that God that God gave Abel you've seen what's taking place all you got to do the same thing and he wouldn't do it and brother BR says he said he said so you you say that you're in Jesus he said and then you deny the word he said something's wrong he said he says he always says Amen to his own word amen he said you know that right right so just like just like Cain when he had his own ideas of what was going to take place and what should take place and it should be like this and I don't understand why God don't want it to be the way he want that that you know that that horrible mess over there that's what God wants you mean I got to go get a lamb and drag it up here and then I got to take that rock and I got to you know because what happens is you know you you get all that blood all over you you get involved in that why because you become one with that lamb amen because you're up there and you you realize hey this lamb is taking my place that's right and you see the bleeding of that lamb and the blood that's flowing and you realize hey this Lamb's taking my place and you realize where you're at and see if you understand that and see that then it's like well but I don't I don't want to do that that that that's too hard that's too messy you know but you know you have to deny yourself amen right and do what God wants you to do see you if you want to come into fellowship with God then you've got to follow the way that God has it laid out for us see God God says you know if you understand if you gather with in the plan of God and he said you know the the things that you have to have have he said for fellowship and with god brother BR says you know there's joy there's Peace of Mind Faith he said longsuffering patience gentleness see if you go with in the faith of God that all these things come your way so if you if you he said what what kind of Faith he said he said the faith to fight the conflict he said not some kind of faith for some Theory or some reasoning or anything but it's faith in God's word it's the real word god coming he said he said because that you have to take it by the word amen yes and it's not just some kind of he said isn't it reasonable that the most you know most of the people come to this church isn't this the big church it's like well obviously you know because they have the more have more people obviously they have to be the truth you know because you know because we want to look at people want to look at it by their own sight right right well you know well that was all of that's in the Old Testament brother we're living in we're living in a realm of Grace you know it's all the whole Bible is nothing but Grace now and you and you tell me that if if God came because if if God comes and takes up residence in you according to the scripture that's what he does when he saves you he said I'll take up we will take up our Abode in you and if the spirit of God dwells in you then you tell me that the spirit of God lives like a carbage can then the that the that you know because you look at people and they well you know uh you know they just they just love the Lord and they you know they they just they're just so full of stuff and you know and the problem is is they're full so so full of devils and you know and yeah well you know I I just I just love the Lord until you until you well you know what the Lord wrote the Bible the spirit of the Lord moved upon those men all the way through the the Old Testament all the way down through time and the Lord was the one that spoke to them to write the scripture the the word was anointed you know they didn't come up with their own idea and write it in books it was it was it was the thoughts of God that was written in in in the languages and ju and just to say this you know people want to say well you know it's not written in the original because we're reading in the English and it's not written in in Arabic or Hebrew or whatever because it's you know because we we need to have we need to have the original and we all need to have you all be Scholars so we'll understand it and I was listening to brother Aaron McGary sometime back and and brother Aaron was talking about how uh the these group of Scholars got together and they were disc discussing the Lord's Prayer and they were discussing all the things that are written in the Lord's Prayer and all these great Scholars got together and you know the only two words in the whole prayer that they could agree on is our father they couldn't agree on anything else that's written there so what what does it take it takes it takes more than just human ideas and and scholarship and and great learning it takes the whole Holy Spirit Well if the if the holy spirit is the one that wrote the book If he if he give if he give men the ideas that came down and he showed them the visions and and they wrote down what God showed them and they took up and just like we see one giving giving this message and the other one picking up the exact same prophecy that came before just like Daniel going back and look what Jeremiah had to say and he picked up the exact same thought and continued on and God was showing him the exact same thing because it run in continuity because the word dovetails together then when it comes together and you see all of that then you know what if God done all of that and brought it all the way through then guess what if it changes from whatever language from Hebrew and Greek and it becomes to the Latin and everything else and when it got to the English then guess what it's the exact same meaning has the same power it has the same purpose it'll do the exact same thing that it did when God thought it and Isaiah wrote it down well it's the same power and it's it's the same it's just as alive as when God thought it and Moses spoke it and Moses wrote it down and it doesn't matter why because all I got to do is have faith in what God Said and you know what that I can see all because all of the Devils that have been defeated and all of the things that have taken place because what God has said in his word and we've seen it take place and that's what shows that this Bible's right am even when you take the things that that has taken place in science and and science breaks in and you see these things take place and you see these things and how the the scripture lines up ahead of time and and and they say well look science science figured this out science figured that out and all of a sudden you know Matthew uh Matthew Mor I believe is his name and uh he's he's known as the father of oceanography and I believe in the Scripture it says that he said that he will lead us in the paths of the Seas see either in Psalms or job there and he talks about that and you know this Matthew Fontaine Mari he uh was a uh United States naval officer and then he was a confederate naval officer and he was over the US Naval Observatory had ship logs thousands and thousands of ship logs new every path how long it took them to travel across the oceans and he sat in there one day and he said well he said if that's true he said then I can prove that there's paths in the sea and he sat down and he started marking every one of those ships and every position that they were in and how long it took them to cross the Seas and all and he started mapping all of the all of the weather conditions all these things he started writing down and this man wrote a book and he is known as the father of oceanography and even the books that are written today on o oceanography are still based on his works and he got and he got the inspiration to write that book because that's what the Bible says and even today when they look at photo um satellite photos and all that of the oceans and everything Matthew fonte Mor's work is still correct and what and here was thousands and thousands of years ago the inspiration hits somebody to write that and then it's 100,000 years later whenever it was then all of a sudden here's this man catches that inspiration and all of a sudden he's writing and and we have that information today and we're we're sending great big ships all around the world toight they're in the ocean going all around the world and it's based on what he done am but you know you you can't trust this Bible well that's that's just one thing that we've seen but you know how many other things have we seen about how God told them to prep the children of Israel prepare your food in different things all the things that's went you know how you how you uh sacrifice all the things that they went through and come to find out it's exactly the proper way of doing things amen just like just like circumcision is done on the eighth day well why why is it done well we know that's a type of Eternity but why is it done on the eighth day because when a son is born when a boy is born it takes eight days for the the vitamins and stuff in his body to build up so he wouldn't bleed to death so they were circumcised on the eighth day because you couldn't do it before then am but all of a sudden you know here God tells them on the e day and all of a sudden science finds out years and years later oh we understand that now but see it's it's all in the plan of God see God knows what he's doing why because he created all of it and he started all this and when he when he set everything in motion then he can tell people tell us how to how everything needs to go well then guess what he knew where you were going to be born he knew your he knew your who your parents were going to be he knew everything that you would do and everything that you'd face and he knew all your ups and downs and all your faults and failures and guess what God brought you to this place and you know he had Grace enough for you in every situation brother R says here he says he said if that church he said if Don't Preach every word of the Bible there and say Amen to every word believe every sign every wonder and see them what working right among them he said I'd get away from it no matter how big how little he said Faith love joy peace and faith in the word he said so let Satan set up his guns we've anchored amen we don't claim to be great people we're not great people in the side of the world we're humble people peasants we don't care for the world's riches but we've got what God has given us see if if we know what the word says then that's all we need and the Devil Comes against us the devil tries to attack us that's all right we're Anchored In Jesus we we've got we're fortified behind the word we know where we stand and if everything comes against us we don't have to worry about that because God will bring us through God will bring us to the place that God wants us to come to brother R speak speaking here and he was speaking about the about his ministry and everything and and all the things he says I'm a middle-aged man 53 years old and he said you know I love him more than I did back there because I've seen him in more trials and fights he said I've seen him when I come to the place where was so tempting when I said something like Noah and Arc this will be he said now watch oh mercy he said it will be stay there he said the Sun Passes on it will be he said why do you say that brother why do you know when you've been through all these things he said why do you know brother bradam that after all you've seen I got because he I'm 53 years old middle-aged man all the things I've seen he said I got confidence in God Amen all he said because I've seen him at all the trials and all the tests and he said and all the fights God's always been there yes sir he said how do you know that brother R he said because God said so he said it will be it has to be God said so he said I've anchored my soul in a Haven of Rest In Jesus I'm safe Evermore ever what comes or goes let's take it in that manner amen see we face all the things that we've seen take what God at his word all that's all you got to do is take God at his word you want to you want to walk in the in the in the in God's favor and all you all you've got to do is do what God says do God God tells us God leads us you know you because if if if God has called us to this place if God's called us in this journey to this place then you know and and and I'm I'm guilty just like everybody else but you know if if God tells us to do something and we hear someone tell something just like just like brother Wade stand up here and tell us listen there's a time y'all need to be here and there's a time y'all need to be ready for church when you come in this place you got you need to be ready and if you're not if you're not in your place then guess what you're hindering then you're hindering the people it's like well you know I I I just get here by the skin of my teeth no that ain't what brother Bram said and you know if you if you if you don't believe in paying your ti that that that's fine but you know what you're robbing yourself of a blessing you you you not you don't Rob God you rob yourself right you you only hinder yourself and all the things and it's like well you know I I and and y'all forgive me I'm just I'm I'm just I'm just me and I'm just going to speak what's on my heart but you know and I don't and I don't I don't say I don't say these things cuz I don't I don't want to say these things and sound like I'm trying to boast myself or anything like that it's none of that but you know some of us we work on Saturday I mean you work all day Saturday you come home and then you get ready and then when you get done and and then I've had to come home got things at the house to do and you know what and you and then when you get done with all of that and it's just rush rush rush rush but you know what we're still here and sometimes I get here late I know but you know what I still get here in time for prayer meeting on on on Saturdays amen now that now that I you know I'm not I'm not saying that to to get on anybody or anything like that because that's not my place but my my thing is this you know you you got to put forth an effort amen and you know I'm not I'm not even better than anybody else you know I'm I'm just a sinner saved by grace and all that you know I'm just your brother but I I want I want y'all to know you know it's a late hour and we need we need to if we if we want if we want to see the move of God if we want to see these things then you know what we need to find we need to find out what things are hindering us what's holding us back and are we hindering the whole church because you know I want to be here and you know and you know if if you don't want to be here that's fine but I'm telling you you're the one you're the one that's robbing yourself we rob ourselves when we don't do what God wants us to do what God's called us to do amen he lays he lays the blessings out there and it's up to you and I to take them and if we don't if we don't want that I I understand not everybody's able to do that and and you know I everybody's cases you know different cases or whatever I'm not I'm not getting into everybody's business I'm just saying you know the P the proofs in the pudding that's right because sometimes when when you come and there's only there's just a handful but you know what if if you don't if you if you [Music] come if you don't come but I tell you what I've been blessed I don't know if anybody else has been blessed or not but you know because sometimes I come and I'm tired and the last place I want to be is that Bible study I'm just I'm just I'm just honest I'm human I sit back there sometimes and I fight sleep I'm tired it feels like I've run all day and the first time I sit in that chair and it's like he's like where's that at brother Aon brother way asked me a question I'm like I'm trying to flip my Rolodex you know it's like it's a little slow little SL I got to open my eyes first I'm praying uh well you know but you know I mean if if we if we if we want to see the move of God that sometimes we got to get out of our comfort zone we've got to move Beyond where we're at see I just want hear a few scriptures before I get done but you know you see these things and Proverbs 15:27 says he that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house but he that hateth gifts shall live it's like what does that mean and and if y'all don't if y'all don't mind me saying um I was listening to brother Aon McGary and um one time and brother Aaron was saying you know if you say he hateth gifts it's like well tell your wife well you can't you can't have nothing else because you you're supposed to hate gifts you know you know well you shouldn't want that because if you hate gifts you know and that we should do away with Christmas and everything because we're eating gifts but no the the problem is is is we're trying to get something we're trying to to gain something and he said he said the problem is is we get greedy for things he said he said a man that's greedy of gain so there's a there's an improper it's it's not it's not wrong to have gain it's it's not but the problem is is if you what does the word greedy mean you're trying to get something by the wrong manner or you're trying to get something that don't belong to you right so if you're trying to get something the wrong way he said then you're troubling your own house well you know what if we don't if we don't live the right kind of lives then you know what nobody in your household's going to be to the place where they need to be if if fathers don't do the right thing if they don't live the example if they don't try to help if if the fathers don't try to bring this then you know what they're a trouble to their own H their house and you know what it takes strong Christians to build strong families to build strong homes and strong families will build a strong church and so what did the scripture say that you know how can a man rule his you know rule the church how can you how can you be a benefit to the church how can you help in the church how can you edify the church if you can't rule your own house if you can't be if you can't roll your own family if you can't be a help to them how you going to help in the Church of God and so it takes these things you know so you not it's not wrong to have these things but if we try to do it the wrong way see it's not wrong to have these things but if you're going after things that that's not going to be edifying to you it's not going to benefit you he said the person that doesn't are not trying to get after those things and see lots of times we want to we want to get into things and try to get things but the problem is is they're not what God wants us to have or it's not the right time for God for us to have those things but if we look and trust God that God will bring us to the place where he where we need to come to right Proverbs 13 13 through 15 it says who so despiseth the word shall be destroyed but he that fearth the Commandment shall be rewarded he said the law of the wise is a Fountain of Life to depart from the snares of death good understanding giveth favor but the way of transgressors is hard see you have the ability and God has laid this out before you that you have this and you know so many times brother Brown talks about the way of the transgressor is hard you know if he had have done what God wanted him to do in the beginning if he had have followed you know he went through all that you know Sister Hope's dying there and he went up there and he was standing there and you know and S the LA you know one of the last words she told Brother brandom she's sitting there you know where we made our mistake said we listen to Mama so we should have went God called us and we shouldn't have worried what everybody else had to say and all the things that he went through when he listen when he went overseas and he was listening to those men and they wanted him to go a certain way and God kept telling him know you need to go to those natives God's not blessing this trip because you're listening to those men you know he was in he was in there and he thought he was going to die and Dr Adair came to him had all those amibas and he's like it shot Dr adir that he was still alive after going through all of that and he was in there pray and the Lord finally come and delivered him from that see you come through all see the law of the wise is a Fountain of Life to depart from the snares of death see thank God we had a prophet that came and told us these things you know the scripture has been written for our example how many times have you had people come up and give their testimony and tell you listen this this is what I've been through this is what God and it's a warning to us amen it speaks to us like then God has given us a warning he's showing us the way that we should go to miss these snares amen let's have the the musicians come let's all stand and so here I want to finish with this quote brother Brown says this is from the testimony on the sea said now listen I want to talk to you while while they're coming he said have faith you come up here he that will confess me before me him will I confess before my father now you confess where you're dilatory how dilatory how you've neglected God you confess that as wrong and say that I'm sorry God that I did that he said find favor with him then watch what he will do for you you just conf confess that you're wrong and he will take care of the rest of it it's it's amazing what we have to do we can just confess our wrongs you know if we confess our sins he said he he's faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness so Lord I I want you to search me and find if there's anything wrong with me and in any evil way where where you know and some sometimes you you you begin to study the the word and you begin to pray and you begin to study and all of a sudden you see yourself and sometimes sometimes when the Lord begins to deal with you you realize you know what this a this is ain't a good picture because God's showing you where you where you're lacking right where I'm where I'm dilator where I had hadn't done the right thing but God's grace to us that he even speaks to us to show us these things but Lord bring me to the place where I need to be I want to be what you'd have me to be I want to be I want all of God's favor I want to be in his favor all the time everywhere I go I want to I want to walk the way he' have me walk amen let's let's all let's all bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for this T night Lord Jesus Lord I Thank You for Your word to us Lord Jesus that Lord that we see ourselves in the word Lord Jesus Lord I I want to be I want to be right with you I want to be I want to be clean Lord Jesus father I Lord I think about the day David in the Psalms Lord where he was writing and he was talking about being surrounded and compassed Lord when when Saul was chasing him and all the things that was taking place and he was being surrounded and all the things Lord and all the stress of Life Lord Lord he said that you came in the midst of all that and you began to deliver him he said because you delighted in me Lord because he he walked upright before you Lord Jesus because he had Clean Hands Lord because he had a Clean Heart Lord that he walked before you Lord when he when he had the opportunity to slay Saul and he stood there and he said God forbid that I touch God's anointed Lord because he walked in the Integrity of his heart Lord Jesus that you delivered him from those things and he could stand up and praise you for what he's seen you do and Lord may we have that same testimony Lord Lord because as we walk in this life Lord we we fail you Lord Jesus and we do things wrong Lord but Lord let us walk in your word Lord that we can walk in in your word Lord and and walk the way that you'd have us walk Lord that doesn't Deliver Us from and problems and trials and everything Lord but we realize that that brings us to a place that you will Deliver Us Lord Lord that you'll bring us out Lord Jesus Lord if we can just walk the way that you'd have us walk Lord Jesus Lord we we know that we have to be Overcomers Lord and
