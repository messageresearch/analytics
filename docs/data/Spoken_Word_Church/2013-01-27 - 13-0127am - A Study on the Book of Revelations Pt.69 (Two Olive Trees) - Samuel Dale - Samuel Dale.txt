13 let every soul be subject unto the higher powers but there is no power but of god the powers that the powers that be ordained of god to good works but to the evil will thou not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of sins for he is the minister of god a reminder to execute wrath upon him wherefore you must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for

remember the sick ones because lord there's many many sicknesses among us and you just bless each one have your way now if we read your word you come and speak your hearts in jesus name amen okay we'll go where we've been reading for quite a while from revelations 1. since the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand what is the time to understand right you find that quote again over in revelations 21 or 22. all right let's go to revelations 11 because that's kind of where we've gotten up to and read just a few verses here maybe the first eight verses there was given a read like unto a rod and the angel given me a read like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of god and the altar and them that worship therein for the court which it but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not but it is given unto the gentiles and the holy cities shall they tread under foot 40 in two months all right remember that's the three and a half years we're going into the two witnesses and i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them fire preceded out of their mouth and divine their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed these have power to shed heaven there right not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood and it's not the earth with all plagues as often as they will and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called sodom and in egypt where also our lord was crucified you may be seated over that is blessing to the reading of the word now we've been in the book of revelations now for quite a while this makes i think about the 69th message so we're you can tell that we're very slow and uh you know moving on but we've covered up and come through taking this and we call it a study on the book of revelations and we just kind of take and we're just moving through the scriptures in the book of revelations to try to get an understanding and and knowing that we know for certainty the prophet describing it he said the rapture comes in revelations 4 1 as a type in john and he said but then the bride is not seen anymore until revelations 19 when we come riding back into the millennial reign and then we look at that and we say well what about this and what about that well that was his saying because that was the point because when we're reading the book of revelations then from revelations 4 you go up into heaven revelations 5 then you see all of the things and remember even up until where we're at actually until you come to the 19th chapter that's why your prophet said it from revelation 4 1 to 19 is to israel because you see then that's when we ride back into the millennial reign all right and and that means that we're coming back to earth all of these other things are taking place on earth yes the seals break the things happening the the beasts the different this that the other but remember john is still up in heaven writing about these things and sending them back to you know the the uh earth as we would call it brother brown said he sent it back to the messenger in the end time to proclaim to the church because see john was concerned how he could get these things back but then he sees in revelations 10 1 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel see he sees that that seventh church age messenger will be a prophet for the word of god to come to all right so we're in the point but now what we're doing is is taking these things that we see from revelations say four one five and all through there of talking to the bride in heaven and then going up to six and coming on through and now this past wednesday we covered the trumpets uh they're in the scriptures you know like the the uh the feast of the trumpets and knowing all of these things pertain to israel in their redemptive journey all right but the book is written to you and i right right see this is the book of redemption this is a complete plan of redemption this is the complete revelation of jesus christ and whether it be old testament or new testament it is still the revelation of jesus christ right now then that revelation of jesus christ is to be given to who to his bride amen so we get all of it like uh you know it's god said can i withhold anything from abraham that's right right see he's there of all things so we just told him everything and that's what we're trying to do is look at the things and see what these things have to do with us all right now in seeing what it deals with us it doesn't put us down i certainly don't want to be there in the tribulation to you thank god for that revelation that we don't have to go well i don't want to be there in armageddon i don't want to be there of all of those things and and see but now that is the physical happening or literal happenings under the seals that goes to israel seal number one they said to brother branham asked him a question the second thessalonians a man of sin sitting in the temple of god showing himself to be as god said does that fulfill the first seal they said yes all right that was just a straight blunt answer because why because there's no need of expressing it anymore i don't want to be here when the man of sin sits in the temple of god to you so then the literal happening of the seals is to israel the literal trumpets sounding the things is to israel right but the spiritual revelation is to you and i and then all right see that we can see and find our place and like i've told you i love the book of revelations because to me it's the bride's book if you want to know where we're at read the book of revelation if you want to know what's going on in the world read the newspaper still the thing of what i'm getting at is we look at the bible and think well well that's got to be us no that's not us in a lot of extent it's about someone else but then we see what it means to us right see we get the complete plan of redemption we stand here even now seeing what will happen in the tribulation when it comes what will happen at armageddon what will happen that the uh platoon judgment right the millennium the things and even what will happen when we enter the future home we see that while we're here that's right so it's a wonderful book yes that we can read but then we said but now wait just a minute now now i thought revelation 10 was seven was was in our day that's true but you know that's got to go to israel right come on this message goes to israel not rhetoric now this message goes to israel through two prophets which this message is the message of the entire bible right now i don't believe they'll go over there and take a quote book you know i don't believe it that way i don't believe that whatever say run around and say so and so they don't have to do that they'll tell them of their own personal revelation right you go into the seventh seal and you'll find the prophet telling you what they preached and they'll tell them so you missed it yeah but this bride has received it and become the wife and everything's over with it let me see all right now in doing that then we can look at it and see the literal things and then see what those literal things has to do with looking at us in the spiritual right just like the the prophet covering from the feast of the trumpets is trying to get across our wednesday that he said all these trumpets sound to israel he said it was natural calling her out of egypt all right it was a natural thing calling them out of egypt that's right all right he said now in the spiritual the in the spiritual to israel now is calling them to the atonement amen but you remember what he said now leviticus 16 is the literal atonement where they offered the first not the first sacrifice because you know obtaining them i mean they will offer to sacrifice but the first setting forth of moses and the the offering of the sacrifice was leviticus 16. all right do you realize then that the calling out of egypt the liberal trumpets sounded to call them out to bring them to that atonement of leviticus 16. praise god all right now you're following me yes see that way you see the literal calling you out and then you see the spiritual right now in the end time it's not a killing again this is not re-killing us you would be wrong to go that way so the prophet says what he said leviticus 16 is it killing the atonement he said leviticus 23 is the mourning for the keel yes it's not a re-killing of the lamb that's right see moses tried to do that messed up right right he was told to smite the rock he smoked a rock all right that would type the killing of the lamb under leviticus 16 which would top christ in him having to be crucified all right but when moses smoked the rock this second time see he broke every scripture in the bible the prophet said set up a new thing all right he said then they would have to be in the end time a morning for the kill it would have to be leviticus 23. see if you understand what i'm saying that if moses hadn't smoked that rock if those things hadn't happened you wouldn't needed a leviticus 23. you wouldn't have no bride either because you had them back there if they took that original atonement come on of the lamb it would have took them straight to jesus christ being crucified for them right and you and i wouldn't be involved come on but see by the way it went moses would smack the rock even though it would set up a wrong thing but yet it would show what god was intending to do to bring israel back right to the atonement praise god they're under the blood of bulls and goats it don't matter if that done the way you said oh no that ended at calvary no there's they're still not under the blood of jesus christ brother around said god comes down each day and heals those people he said but they're still they don't believe him right they're not under the atonement of jesus christ that's what i'm gonna try my best to get everybody to see people say oh they're not in the old testament if you're not born again you're still in the old testament where you're at right jesus christ died to pay the price to come and live in us that's the new testament amen amen see you're still under the law if you're not born again that's why paul would come along and say christ at the end of the law for righteousness if you're not born again today see then you're still under the old testament rules and regulations that's right no no no that was done with calvary show me where it was underway for calvary calvary magnified right all right we're sleeping that was the calling of the natural bringing them out of egypt coming up bringing them to the atonement all right then leviticus 23 is not a re-killing of the lamb but it's when israel in the end time will accept the revelation just a hundred forty four thousand them not all israel they will accept the revelation of jesus christ and they'll say where did you get the nail prince in your hands and it thinks through the two witnesses right that's right all right see that'll bring them to a mourning for the keel that's why they separate and cry for days because they see they crucified their own messiah right he said well the ones over here didn't have anything to do with it well i i guess that we're not under sin because he went wrong is that what you're saying well i didn't do it he done it no he represented us he set it up in this way that's right now you want to go that if you want to go that way won't you go the other way john was the only one who went up the rapture come on see if you want to go one way once you can't go the other way with it but john represented the bride right israel will be mourning for the keel when those two witnesses bring the revelation over to them and they can see it they will not be re-killing the lamb they will see the lamb as he leaves the mercy seat and comes to them that's right brother asked me the other day he said what do you think about the lamb leaving the mercy seat i said well first doctrine to hit and come to message was couldn't be saved because it came in the message in 67 and i told him i couldn't be saved after 63 because then left the mercy seat i said well according to the bible lamb left the mercy seat before the foundation of the world i said that's what the bible says the prophet never taught nothing like that he said because you got to cover the lamb leaving the mercy seat you realize right now if the rapture took place you'd say the land left the mercy seat with you you better be careful right that's only for you and i you got to remain on the mercy seat for the 144 000 come on you know that even after they come in he's got to be on the mercy seat to go to the white throne because there will be people at the white room given eternal life right right do i worry about redemption being over or what this is or that is why not worry about the redemption that's being revealed by the prophet unto the bride of christ to get her ready amen because what we're looking at the trumpet is what that's the calling out of israel you know that under that we covered the 200 000 000 demons it was loose on through hitler and mussolini and them to drive the jews back to the homeland that's right i hope you got what i talk about on that wednesday night what about the tender hand of jehovah with israel putting up with all of their garbage cans and yet he would put him into bondage under the surrounding nations to try to get them to straighten up that's right now what if he hadn't done that right you realize the jews would have never went back to the homeland they were rich people they didn't want to leave germany and and russia and all of these countries and go home why because they were rich so god just said okay i'll send my tender hand of mercy down to them and i'll just kill about six million of them you say god done that well no he permitted it to be done he permitted hitler and him to do that to get the people to go back to the homeland well that don't sound like mercy to me well what if he had to send him back to the home man right okay now what was we talking about wednesday we look at these things to see the natural but then we look and see about us it brought around and say it i'm sitting standing here looking at it did he say that on feast of the trump they said 20 years later those demons that was released under hitman and ikeburn eichmann and them mussolini to drive the natural jew to the homeland he said was released on the bride that's right right right right come on pull that nut bro make sure everybody understands what i'm getting at because you'd say well i don't really know what that won't go to read the book you give the paragraph and give the page number and people won't go home and read the book they'll come back later well i don't really know where he said that or not well i gave you the f well i don't know what paragraph's right or not what do we do around here just look at number one this is off the feast of the trumpets paragraph 161 and notice what happened under the sixth trumpet they were turning loose on the jews he talked about the two hundred 000 000 demons right the persecution of the jews supernatural devils nearly 2 000 years been loosed by stalin hitler upon the jews you say well that isn't wrong he said it's the same spirit that's right they've done the same thing they did to the christians in the old pagan roman days all right look at the next one okay paragraph 183 thanks to the trumpet what has it done in the cunningness as he said he come in like flatteries and what has he done he bring in the protestant ecumenical council of the world churches the spirit of antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride how looked in the acquisition church spirit loosed upon what not upon their denominations upon the bride that's right well see you'll get it the bride will not go through that time so you don't go through the tribulation no but they lose their to what and it's to bring us to the message because if you go on reading you've got down to uh i see a paragraph that he's written down somewhere paragraph 189 but around actually even says the feast of the trumpet he said 20 years later after that war see so if it's loose under eichmann and hitler them in the 40s in the 60s all those demons that was loosed on the jews is now loosed on the bride that's right you mean god let that brother down i just don't believe you you just you're some kind of a saddest or something well brother must have been something because he's the one that said so you call him that well i don't know about that now well why won't you afraid of it i'm afraid of him but not afraid of me what's the difference in what the word says 20 years after hitler and them drove them to the homeland he's loosed on you and i am amen to do what to drive you and i to the message of the hour the tender hand of god's mercy amen come on amen you say yeah but but that just don't look like god is petting us and i think god's way to do it anyway you show me that in the bible you showed me where he just pat looks like a dodeo granddaddy no he wants his children to stand on his word amen and sometimes he's got to put you in a persecution not a tribulation we don't believe in the tribulation for the bride of jesus right no way but there will be persecutions come upon us to drive us to the message you know it's good for somebody to cross you you get so settled down and you just get on you know everything's okay okay you know and somebody comes along saying hey you're wrong and then wait just to cut and pick a minute i ain't wrong well take what you got right then and try to argue with them about it you might find out you're missing a few pieces out of your puzzle right amen right right right because the bible says there must needs be heresies among you one that they that are approved may be made manifest right so it's good to be crossed right it's good for somebody to tell you hey you're wrong church then what are we doing see those those demons loose by hitler and them came over into a spiritual condition to persecute the bride to drive her to the message you just got down to where you just spiritually speaking you just seem like you're starving to death if you ain't never got there you've got an opportunity ahead of you and you will come there because that the children of god must be brought to god the way and if natural israel it cost him six million besides this that's just a number to get them to come to the homeland you think we're going out of here with a flower bed of ease oh the bride's nothing on the bride not going through tribulation no way in the world but there's persecution coming you say well brother dale i just don't believe that i believe it's all hunky dory from now on well about four more years the way we're going we're gonna find out and i told you over and over it wouldn't make no difference if mccain or what his name was would have been put in the white house four years ago we'd probably be in worse shape than we are now amen bible my bible said i put in kings i take out kings so the right guy's in the white house and i done told you the way i believed it if it was down to one vote and i had it and i knew and i didn't vote now so i ain't voted since kennedy when i found out we put the capital in the white house and i quit voting that's true you vote that's your choice that's your god-given right to america but if there was one boat left and i had it and i knew that guy would be the one that would bring the persecution down upon you and i to drive us to this message i'd go vote double time yeah why because the prophet said we do better under persecution now look folks we ain't looking forward to it it's not a happy time israel being killed all over the country burning cooked and shot and everything in the world that's right but that was god's tender hand driving them to the home all the little trials and the little temptations and problems we have i would really tell you you don't understand me i'm having so much trouble thank god for trouble come on am i right yes you say well you sure won't say that when anything you get hungry i'll say i told you we're going to get hungry i hope somebody can speak the word amen come on folks yes i used to have enough food in my house to feed this church for a year because i looked at it like it was coming but then i found out the stuff was getting too old and what is it which one is it the one under one other of them they they keep your supply in their house and but they rotate it they want it they know what to do they you know they rotate it out and heat it up you know what we know we rotated out and we ate a hog are you talking about one of the biggest hogs you've ever seen we raised a hog out of what we had in the house you know i still think you'll have something laying around the house what if the weather goes back that's right if you ain't got nothing there's nothing in the grocery store that's right you know i heard a man the other day i don't mean it's a joke i heard a man the other day said he said this ice wouldn't come it was supposed to hit us here you know and everything and everybody run to the store and he said tuesday morning they were taking their milk and getting their money back i thought that is about like people and they found that it wasn't going to ice up so they're going to take a few gallons of milk back but listen church how serious those demons have loosed on you and i to drive us to the message of our lives this message is going to take you and i interchange and do it now you remember the reading there what he said he said you come in like flatteries right you know the word flatteries is used in the book of daniel daniel 11 21 11 32 and 11 34. in the book of daniel flatteries that's when you're invited in that's not when you're forced into something this ruler that's come will take over is going to come in by flatteries in other words be invited in you want to go back to the seal book 63 where the prophet said they've got satan superman in the pope come on that was in 63 amen all right church come in by flatteries you know you're going to vote to do away with your rights oh lord have mercy that's kind of an odd way of saying it because they're going to force you to vote and you say i won't vote a no vote is a yes come on a no vote is a yes right so it don't matter where you vote or not you're gonna vote away your rights you're doing it now and they're passing laws what are they facing now you know in 1974 they passed a law that most of you couldn't come to church today right in the state of georgia that you couldn't travel over 25 miles to go to church that law is still on the books that's 1974 when you had the oil crisis you see we're looking for things to come and i'm telling you we're already here is that this all right but listen church now the great eternal god would be so wonderful to israel to drive her to the homeland now you know what your prophet taught on the fifth seal so we don't have to go back to that do we who are those people in the fifth seal brother brown said it was the jews that was killed from calvary up till man now not ever jew because that wouldn't make it fit right right because it's not every jew be saving the end times only 144 000 right right but the field seal shows you that those people were not annihilated away from god the true jews will be given eternal life that's according to the fifth seal come on all right then in doing that look at the tender hand of god's mercy i know that you don't understand myself but you know it was a horrible thing when those 20 kids died up during that that man just went in and killed him but you know what there was 20 kids went to heaven that day that's a tender hand of mercy of god i don't care what religion they belong to who their mom and daddy was or what was going on or whatever they were like four or five-year-olds maybe see you don't look at it right you look at it as a horrible thing no i don't want it to happen again no way but the tender hand of mercy just think about that see then we're looking at it comparing what happens to them to see what will take place to you and i to drive us to the homeland now i'm not going to say the wrong thing i hope about it because i know people misunderstand me anyway but you know there's a lot of preachers running about the country because of bad luck nah i'm not going to argue with nobody i'm just going to say bad luck didn't call me to preach now they said it did to them and that may be right you see people you don't get up say well the lord the lord was going to take my family if i didn't start preaching well now i want scripture for that i want the prophet's message for that but you see that's what we look at we think that we've got it all figured out we see this message is what's supposed to straighten out all the things we thought we had figured out that's right right right see only by this message can we understand the bible see my ideas and your ideas was was way off right right i told you somewhere i had heard when i was a kid that at the end of the world when it comes is i knew it was supposed to be in the cloud somewhere and something might hurt all them things in my mind and somebody said they'd be a cloud come over said well you know it was the right cloudy look it looked like a rainbow i mean excuse me looked like an umbrella well every time they come up a clown got it made this time colleen's umbrella come on church we used to think mama taught us that hell was eternal right right if we didn't get saved we're going to burn in hell eternally right and that's what they've done was try to scare us into being saved right right the prophet said you scare a person into doing something he said the next time it's twofold trying to get him to come that's right don't you scare them kids jesus don't like you get you up with a hickory and whoop them don't tell them jesus don't like them that's do what you're supposed to do with mama and daddy yes that's right spirit of the rod what does it say your bible says spoil the child well you believe in beating kids no i believe in correcting here not beating them you beat one and it goes too far i'll take you to jail i mean i'll take you to jail i'll come to your house and take you to jail i mean to be mom and daddy and raise the kids correctly and correct them well let them grow up to be what they want too that's what's messed this world up let them grow up after they're 18 20 years old they'll be what they want to do but that's okay everybody said that i don't preach on them things but i hate it every once in a while enough to let you know where i stand but listen comparing israel in her journey to our journey that's right and then we don't have to be there when these things take place but we look at what's taking place even now and see what god is doing to get his bride ready to bring us to the message of the hour but the main thing is not as i said now troubles that's part of god's way of doing things but what is he wanting us to do if persecution will bring you to a rapture then just line up and we'll get the belts out and start whooping each other all right now is that plain enough that won't work so i'm not teaching persecution to drive us to the message that way like you're thinking i'm talking about the tender hand of mercy of almighty god that's the only way he can get our attention that's right to get our attention i like the way the prophet says it like this he's preaching on desperation when he says one statement like this he says there's no way for us to get desperate god has to make us desperate okay keep reading in the same book you know what he'll say he said what all the things we've seen or to make us destroy amen right now come on see that we don't get the people quoting both statements they're quoting the one they want to line up with their doctrinal idea or something instead of stating it like he's saying it see what you and i have seen the hour that we're living were to drive us to desperation amen you don't ever think about know your parents you know everything about your children you do anything in the world to prepare them to keep from them being hungry or you know things happening right come on you do anything wrong with me but what about bringing them to church i mean you know that's got a problem because bringing means somebody gotta bring them did you get that do i need to rephrase that for you to understand it if you're going to bring them brother brown said you know what around said it was a sin listen you know me quoting he said it was a sin to send your kids to sunday school or church wanted to do one other statement boy you stop on that see that he didn't believe in it would you please know right that's all right you work all week to make food buy clothes that's right and yet you don't take the kids for sure okay mark that milk that's a good one okay now listen church looking in the book of revelations to see what that will help us to see ourselves and what's going on in our day amen but now get to the point i'm saying a moment ago that i didn't finish it's not persecutions that reveals the word okay persecutions don't reveal the word right come on right uh you understand what i'm saying persecution somebody whipping you don't reveal the word to you it might reveal something else to you but it don't reveal her to you right see then to drive us to the homeland the message of the hour if we left here and move over here and we keep this thing doctrine from here to here right god hasn't done anything right right right that's right just this message this message is my homeland amen amen the message of the hours my homeland that's right that's my inheritance and i find it it that i own everything am i right everybody that needs a squatter because that's where you're going to believe it but you see then if we don't bring the message what good is the persecution amen israel god drove them back to the homeland and like i was praying out there wednesday you know what brother claude said about it it was a good good point world war one ended with nobody knowing why it ended right you know what ended because they had taken over israel and was getting set in them free to worry that 20 years later or so 30 years almost they could become a nation so world war one was thought about israel well that's going to call it fought about you know ain't it audit we fought germany in them and you only god that in world war one they had in god we trust on their belt buckles and we had in god we trust on our belt buckles they don't know why the war ended 20 years later you're fighting them again kind of like the amorites and the things in the bible right totally annihilate a nation in the next chapter they fight now but now listen it's the revealed word why were they put back into israel in the natural to establish the nation of israel right getting it ready to work that god could call out 144 thousand amen out of all that nation we see brett around spent all those years trying to turn our hearts back to the face of the father is that the message you don't hear that talk of much anymore but i still think it's right that's right i don't think we've got so revelated until we've lost the faith of the fathers i think a lot of people have because they've lost the word that's right that's all right that's their business that's not driving me to the homeland you see you understand now let me make a point then go on see god was getting ready to give them a nation he wasn't just going to put them back in israel and let them stay in bondage right he was going to give their nation back to him when that flag would fly again the only flag that's ever resurrected right he was making them ready to be a nation and then making it ready to call that 144 000 out of there this message is to call out a group of people right right now let me quote some more of them didn't the prophet say that they would have to be a bride come out of this church that's right he divides their church in the bride right he says the church gonna go through the tribulation that's right but he said the bride's not so there's gonna be a bride called out of it just like that 144 000 is going to be called out of israel amen the rest of them are israelites come from the same abrahams and that food down to the ledges but they're not to predestinate it right you see what i'm trying to do is just pick up things and just talk about it as far as you and i yeah you and i and where we're at all right see what i like then is to look at the message you know i've always said i thought maybe my ministry was too take things that look like the prophet says this and the prophet says that the bible says this the bible says that looks like it's going in different directions and you know just kind of study on that a while and see that it's brought together right and be a wonderful picture just like i was saying the other day you know run around about 30 something times says you're gonna get a new body come on but then he explains it's not this going to get another body we're going to get this body redeemed right all right you said well which quote do you want i want both of them right but when this body is redeemed it will be new all right it just takes a little while for the holy spirit to put the quotes together come on that's it and that's what i love about it i like to look at something and see something boy man according to my mind that don't fit right and then you keep looking at it you say well there's one thing about it he didn't say both times right you know both of them can't be right exactly yeah that's like my brother said that time when you way back in the 60s and they were talking about the daniel 70 weeks and you know arguing seven or three and a half and he said well said i guess it's 10 now if i told you who that was you'd get mad at me but i heard him all right but you see it can't be both uh so somewhere it's got to come together right then it's a revelation amen the revelation is what's going the prophet wanted us to get amen right just as the preparation with israel was to get her to the homeland to where he could draw that hundred forty-four thousand mile an hour this little bride he's had churches churches churches is where your prophet sent it one day he said he's even had bride bride brides but he said those come in one amen now what's he talking about was all him brides wrong oh that's where your problem's at right around get in the steel book in places and say that lutheran western then was a substitute you remember that we had a big man here wasn't supposed to preach everyone stood right here one day and said see that i said luther wesley pentecost is all faults well that wasn't what brother brown said well well he said a substitute well you know the blood of wolves and goats were the substitutions right until the blood of jesus christ came for in other words it was partial revelation right amen partial realization you were familiar with that yes but we're supposed to be down here to perfect realization amen not just partial all right now you know the few weeks ago when i quote brother brown when he says it those combat beasts blind the ox of man the eagle he said but under them the end time couldn't be brought i'm paraphrasing it but i'll be glad to find it right he said that revelation couldn't come that was needed in the end time through the line the option of man oh but you didn't have a perfect understanding that's right they didn't have perfect understanding you ever notice when he gets over there and questions and answers before he preached the seventh seal he said if that seventh seal don't break we're just presuming presumed means to venture without authority and all week long he's preached thus saith the lord now what's he doing come on church i'm sorry that i bring these things to your attention to get you the thing but you see there was dust saying the lord through the week the seals was right that he preached was right but if that seventh seal don't break right right come on you left with a problem just like if this bride don't reach the place to be chained in a moment a twinkle of an eye right then everything behind it has got a problem right right right that's where i love to get them little things and just see this now then we got something to stand on we got a revelation okay let's do something just for a minute i'm not going to be able to get the whole message but that's all right brother brother matthew be preaching this afternoon now give me notes for wednesday i don't even have to study that'd be good all right go to revelation 11 and let's just read this from revelation 11. now we're going to compare revelation 11 with zechariah 4 in just a moment so we read this to start off and that was given to me a reading of the measure and a different thing happening the main thing i want you to come on down and give it a power unto my two witnesses they're prophesying what 42 months three and a half years one thousands uh 206 which is what three and a half years these are the two olive trees yes and the two candle sticks before the god of the earth okay these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks all right right now we know that brother brennaman is explaining these two olive trees number four on you go ahead brother number four who are these two ollie trees he said it's moses and elijah the two olive trees all right he says when in zechariah 4 and 11 them two olive trees and so forth which is moses and elijah when they come on the earth they prophesy 1264 days exactly three and a half years all right now he says that's those two olive trees if i have time if i don't at the end of it i'll try to give you the quote he says those two olive trees is moses and elijah right we just read it now in a minute we get down to the patmos vision and he says the two olive trees is the older new testament you got something look like it's going this way and you got something looks like it's going that way right now but it's got to be brought together amen okay and bringing it together then it'll bring the revelation of what's it'll require that the revelations transpired all right now i know and you know too that they argued with brother graham about it and someone wanted to make it moaning book to be enoch and elijah and all of the things and uh he says no he said because in its ministry don't top out and things so he typed out the ministry of moses and elijah right the closing of the heavens and the plagues and the things that happened and all that was happening to through elijah and he types it out to show all right another way of looking at it is when you get over to matthew 20 matthew wanted to somebody help me said matthew there where is it 16 or 17 worth it then he goes up on the mountain and the two witnesses appear with him which is moses and elijah the bible even said it's moses and elijah that comes with those two witnesses and that is the second coming of jesus christ all right now so we're holding it to seeing now why would it be that he would say that the two olive trees is moses and elijah and then he would say that it's the old in the new testament see you know i'm saying see this is going to get to a revelation amen but we got to go through to get to where we can see it exactly right okay all right now the revelation is what's going to turn us back not the literal pages on the book remember the prophet what he said he said this bible can be questioned as long as it's laying here on letters that's right but he said when it's revealed that's it all right like i've told you over and over boyle roberts university has brother brown's message they have the books the tapes and the things with a computer any professor in that college could speak exactly what i'm saying today that's right because he could pull up the quotes what did brother brown say about these two women oh that's moses and elijah well school we don't agree with that but it's what the man says you understand they can tell you everything brother brown says well is that a revelation is it a revelation to know that the white horse rider is the antichrist you see yes that was a revelation brought by the prophet amen good but what about you now what's been revealed from you today you know what i love about brother brown he said you're standing the line with the book that's him and he said same ones revealing that standing right here in me and there's a day somebody else going that away right now can you see somebody else riding away from you as the word is being revealed to you so now you're getting down to seeing what that steel really is right right it's revealing jesus christ amen the seals don't reveal the devil that's what we went wrong on it we think it reveals a horrible thing it reveals the revelation of jesus christ was why i read 69 times revelation 1 1-3 it's a revelation of jesus christ it's not the revealing of the devil when you see christ you'll see the devil going the other way of course we're trinitarians come on we didn't have much problems with it because we were trinitarians we had one on the throne and one over here and one over there and we didn't know how many others run around in the middle right but see then god started revealing the one god to you you know what happened all these things riding off in the other directions run out and prove this wrong that's right and you see the lamb in the new birth and you're on your birth just because right around brought the message don't make you and i turn back right it just gave us the opportunity amen to be turned back amen right and look what it says now the two olive trees i know i don't have time so we'll do it we'll shortcut it okay brother joe go to number five we're short cutting i'll pick it up no wait wait wait we got to go here we got to go to this come on because you missed the whole point all right zechariah 4. look what he says call me coming home weighed me out of sleep and said unto me what sister i said i've looked and behold a candlestick of gold with a bowl up on the top of it and seven lamps they're on and seven pops into seven lamps which are on the top they're up and two olive trees buy it one up on the right side of the bowl and the other up on the left side of the boat okay run it up before we get down to the lights where you can see what it is and we know the two ollies what are these two ollie trees proving that it's moses and elijah what does it come to the light what are these two olive trees which through the two golden pipes can't go the golden oil out of themselves then he said these are the two anointed ones which stand by the lord of the whole earth two witnesses that stand with jesus on mount transfiguration amen so it's moses and elijah it's not enoch and in a different thing all right now we get that lined up but now i want you to think about something brother joe pull up number number five eight i want you to read two scriptures revelations 11 4 says these are two olive trees and two candlesticks come on are you ready okay the people out there might not see it but turn your bible revelation 11 4 says there's two olive trees and two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth zechariah says what says thou looked and said behold a candlestick of gold with a ball up on the top of it and it's seven lamps they're on and seven pipes from the seven lights which are from the top there and two olive trees by it one up on the right side the bowl in the book of revelation you got two candlesticks all right it's not supposed to be candlesticks gonna be lap stands right because candlesticks don't work candles would burn out so it's not that it's supposed to be lap stand i got the quote from the prophet here you already know that all right a capital will burn out and it's not it's a seven gold right there it isn't in the thing showing you the seven golden candlesticks and the wicks running up and the things you know going to it now what are they describing the same thing one says two candlesticks the other one says one candlestick hey what's the difference what's the point the point is that you've got something going this way it's not going that way yes this is not dealing with two white blind man and one blind man that one writes one or another one this is the two prophets writing the word right okay but back here in zechariah he's explaining because you're going in zechariah and what does it say he says this is the spirit of the lord right zechariah 4. come on there's going down through there this is what is this he said this is the spirit of the lord this is not my power not my mind but by the spirit of the lord all right zechariah is looking forward and he sees a seven golden candle stick and he sees a bowl on there bowl up on the top and he sees pipes running out he sees the two olive trees all right that's moses and elijah right or as the prophet says that's the old and new testament because there's worthy oil is being drawn from right that's why it can't be candles see they burn out so it's lighting of the candlesticks you know the things that goes across and when you're getting in there then you're seeing that zechariah he's seeing the seven church ages right zechariah seen the seven church ages because he got the seven votes seven pipes up you know he's not all over the place or the bold in the seven pots or seven lamps he's describing the church they would come down to seven church ages and that's why and zechariah said that you know not by not power not by mine let's see what and he answered when he said i don't know who this is verse 6 the fourth chapter then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto the removable now the word of the lord to jerubal was the word of all of those old testament prophets and then you got seven golden candlesticks and you got seven angels that the word comes to right each messenger to each age and you've got the life one to kept it all off to bring the revelation of the hour all right so when you see it in the new testament you don't see exactly what you're looking at because of one reason see in revelations if you'll notice these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks okay but zachariah only described one candlestick right but they're all coming from each side so it's the old and the new testament but it's the two witnesses right because over in revelations you're only dealing with the two witnesses you're not dealing with the church are you listening you'll see the difference zechariah describes the church the bride seven golden candlesticks out of one lamp stand right one lamp stand with the seven pipes running out and he says this is the power of god this is the word of god he's describing you and i john on patmos is not describing you and i because we're done gone into rapture come on get the thing what it's saying it don't say it don't say these two olive trees and then besides that there's two candlesticks standing out here it doesn't say that that's what your mind is reading into it it says these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks well they're one of the same because that's the old and the new testament that those two prophets will take to israel in their and that 144 000 will come out of that right they will describe the candlesticks they will describe christ of what zechariah's talking about you know that they're selling church ages in the old testament that's right now i can't put them together i'm honest i get a few of them but i can't i can tell you where miriam and their dancing with pentecostals but hey some of it i can't put together was honest because i never heard the prophet put it together now if i find where he put it together i can tell you what you are all right but you see what i'm getting at see we're we're connected in this praise god this is us this is after we're gone in the rapture zechariah's describing you and i the black revelation is describing the two witnesses and the entire bible standing there the two wings of the eagle the old and the new testament stretched out through those two prophets they're not lawgivers they're not standing there screaming the law they're preaching the revelation of jesus you see it does pertain to you and i we do see ourselves in these things because they're going to tell them these two prophets is going to tell them the entire plan of redemption that's right now they're going to describe to them this is what i want to finish with see then they're going to tell them about that feel sealed you come on if they're going to tell them about all the rest they're going to tell them about to feel sealed you see that was the secret that was hidden in the bible that no one knew we could read how that israel was blinded in part for us and things yeah but we didn't know what to do with them right we just blinded themselves to hell here comes a prophet he said not ever israelite down through there but he said a predestinated group of people will be given white robes and according to the book of revelations they're given white robes before the 144 000 are killed that's what the scripture says given white rose and said you know rest and wait because until your fellow brethren are killed what about telling those israelites paul paul knew some things he said he's taken up to the third heaven saw things he couldn't talk about but yet he wasn't the end time prophet so he couldn't tell us about it right so he just got his mouth shut he wouldn't like everybody else i think it's just i think thing that they didn't know one of my new thoughts ain't worth two cents but don't you think it'd be a wonderful thing for that for john to look and see they're on patmos that's 1995-96 remember so by then john would have already probably been well acquainted with apostle paul right but paul was killed somewhere in what in the 50s i guess i'm just giving dates i don't know exactly but i know the patmos vision was 80 95 96 so john had already been with paul and probably talked to paul about paul why in the world did you write that all israel to be saved he said i don't know i don't know maybe just cause a lot of people and i'll be a castaway for them is that scripture but he says john i believe god showed that to me john leaves and he comes back oh done gone so he couldn't explain it to him john comes back seeing that fifth sealed jew sure he couldn't understand fully about it come on but rather said he opened one of those seals and let john say his name so if he surely was the writer of those things and those fifth seals you come up there and you think paul wouldn't be happy to see him i spoke of it john comes along and said i saw him but you see one of these days we're gonna see him so all israel will be saved not ever israelite not every jew no the predestinated because only the predestinated in the bride amen that's gonna make it think about it see take something looks like it goes that way look like it goes that way you just give it a little time right and it'll come together and when it does you got something you walk on amen something you can stand on and say it sure did look like it was contrary but now i see now i understand because the prophet has brought the message come on brother the prophet has brought the message and now i see i can see back that way i can see over that way i can see what they get and i've seen what i get the plan of redemption what about him see it's coming together all of the things that we used to think were mysteries you know that we bad this you know a lot of people in the message are still preaching the mystery and i do too of the engrafting of the gentiles but you know we preached out the baptist church because we could read the scriptures that didn't mean we understood it but we praised it that's what i'm saying about oral roberts university now they can take this message and tell you exactly what brother brown said but it's also like i told you when was up our jeff that time about 78 60 excuse me and billy paul come out there and told him that the world council of churches is just sent a court order for us to send them a church age book why the world you want to do that for all you gotta do is go down there and pick up a whole truckload you can't use that as evidence right see now the computers are out there the law can use spread around them against you they said you believe everything he said yeah i don't believe it well he said he'd be over in 77. you can't explain to them that he didn't say that right they just give you quotes see it's all set up now to where they can anytime they want to they can take us but the thing about it is they're not going to be able to do very much with us because what i love about it when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord will raise up a standard i'm not concerned yes we may hit hard times and maybe need to get rid of some of these bellies we got too many we're not going through the tribulation but persecution can be upon us in a great way he said well what if it don't well if it don't i'm happy but if it does you're gonna have to admit this old boy took you in the face and told you it's coming so now which one's gonna be embarrassed that way you can grin and say like i did 1974. i said we could price the year 2026 and not break bread around semesters proved it by his message by the quotes you know nobody don't want to know how to come up with that they think it's just a prediction but you know what obviously all of them said it's going to be overweight in 77 and you know it wasn't over with so i'm still grinning yeah and if it passes the year 5000 i'll still be grinning of course i'll be a little old take on these things comparing those things compare the book of revelations with the book of daniel sometimes just read them together and just read it and read it jesus i believe he's still a savior i believe he's here to take care of us um believe in your words right else thank you anybody else and remember brother boyd's sister they still haven't operated here they're afraid to operate them because you don't have enough pain and thanks to being able to have an operation all right we also believe everybody oh anybody else oh thank you so so is so you
