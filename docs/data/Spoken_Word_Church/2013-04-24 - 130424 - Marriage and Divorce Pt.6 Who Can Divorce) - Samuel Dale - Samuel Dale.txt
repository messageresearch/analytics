heavenly father we thank you lord for this day and your love unto us thank you for your grace and your guidance and your understanding thank you for you and we just ask you now that you'd come and lord speak to our hearts and our lives this night be with those that are not here you know a lot of the reasons why some are sick but some are just plain old sin sick and lord then they don't want to get out and come on but that's lord into their hands and we have nothing to do with that we just praise your great name because of those who do have a desire in their heart to be able to be here and father we commit it to you now and just have your way and let your love be made manifest in each one of us remember brother gary grant's our lord and his father is getting real low and everything and just be with him and just bless the family and take care of everybody we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen matthew 19 the pharisees came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let no not man put asunder and they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing a divorcement and to put her away he saith unto them moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word you know now my wife told me the other day and some of the others just said i i used the word sunday that was not a correct word and i just hope that you were listening to the rest of the message as well as you heard the one word i used and you know that always seems to be the way it is though everybody here is the one you goof up on and i used a 50 60 or something version of a word and you know everybody kind of thinks that it's a bad word but webster says it's a female dog or he says it's a a lewd woman so now either way you know the word is dire but i shouldn't have used it and it was just one of those slips like i said it's a 50 or 60 word that we talk about that doesn't mean a bad thing but to everybody coming up today you know there they want you to make sure you don't use some of those words and uh oh you know and josiah got on to me one time for for using the word years ago it wasn't too awfully bad but i was using the word stupid or something like that and but i've tried to get away from using that so i'll try to get away from using the slang for the female dog you know and do the best that i can forgive me but just count it to the fact of being old age you know and that way you do have an excuse ronald reagan said it he was your president he couldn't remember so he he could say things and he couldn't remember you know that's uh but that's all right lord help us all right all right now we're into the topic of what we're doing on marriage and divorce and uh i'm sorry in this that i have to use a lot of words that you know are not uh common ordinary words to be used in a in a minister you know a minister to be speaking of of adultery fornication polygamies and all like that but yet you couldn't preach the bible if you didn't use those words because it would put you into a bad situation to try to stomp around it you know and do it but you know the lord give us grace and help us to understand now brother branham we want to start off with the point of where we left off if we can uh on marriage and divorce that because of the fall you know jesus said from the beginning it was not soul and brother brown said it won't be so over there all right but he said under this present condition of where it's at all right now i i've i want to if i could use that word i used sunday which was a very small word but if i could do that and make you remember the things that i'm saying i'd be glad to say it over again all right but i want you to remember one thing we are not playing with this message not playing with the scriptures and the things and that's what we want to deal with tonight on a hard basis if we have to to try to make sure you understand because you know jesus said if a man puts away his wife for any other reason than fornication he's going to cause her to commit adultery why because she's going to get married anybody that marries her is going to commit adultery all right now i didn't say that jesus did and then we'll get on to to some points in a moment of it but brother branham said i want to use this first and then we'll get into our thought so go ahead and pull up the first one brother uh if some of you are using just a single quote form it'll be this like but it's paragraph 66 of marriage and divorce preaching 1965 021 to morning service now if that be so we have two schools of thought on marriage and divorce and that is one of them says that now that's one of them a man can only be married once unless his wife is dead now that's number one and that's one of the questions when you go to following that you go overboard so you miss it all right so that would have to be wrong to go on that line see and then the next says number two said oh if the wife or the husband either one has committed adultery either one of them can be put away and married again and you find yourself overboard with that so now that's the two schools of thought and he says you go overboard on either way all right so then you know i want people to understand me one thing tonight maybe especially the hard way of stating it that people say well the man can do this and a man can do that now i want the grounds for the man to be able to now jesus said from the beginning it wasn't so now we're going to have to go in it and find out it's not whether she burns the bread or don't smell good or whatever you got to have a scriptural grounds if you're going to put your wife away and according to the bible it can only be for fornication that's right you know if you're going to put her away and try to marry again now we get down into it after a while the prophet says you put your wife away for cutting her heart he said you can't marry again for that reason so you can put your wife away for some reason that's right but what is the reason you're putting her away for right if there's anything outside of the scriptural dealings then look what you've created a bad situation but just think about that now because that you know that's that's the way we should think and be serious about it you say well and i've said it too and i'll say it over and over this is not to to be married twice or three times or what is not the bless not the point of blaspheming the holy ghost it's not going to keep you out of heaven it may determine the way of getting there because i've made my own self point blank from the very beginning that if we have a marital situation that we cannot deal with in this life some way then we will not be able to be there i believe at the change in the moment between club and i that's right that's that's me that's brother daley that's not brother branham there's not a quote for that that's just how strong i stand on it and i don't stand on the ground or somebody coming along said well me and my wife divorced because you know she just she just was you know she she wasn't under subjection that's what they do in the message you know she wasn't under subjection to me but what does that mean you know what are you talking about if you can't bring up something that will deal with fornication then the marriage is still there and i'm sorry that's the way it's stated and that's the way it has to be but we've got to deal with it but we do have the grace of marriage and divorce to be able to come under that to believe it if we can receive it and it can only be done by revelation you remember that our sunday we kept on dealing with that a little it was sunday where the prophet said it's got to be revealed amen well i was sitting there when he preached it well that don't make a bit of difference if it's not revealed to you there was a lot of people sitting there when he preached a future home he said i count on my hand you know or hands maybe maybe 10 or something but you see it's got to be revealed and if it's not revealed then the situation is binding so then we have to deal with it up on our own we can't just uh you know say well you know my case is different brother random in here says it don't make no difference now we got to go with the scriptural points see all right now then let's go with it the way he brings it and see what we can come up with well because of the fall there was two covenants made one for the male one for the female one as the prophet would say for the product and one for the byproduct but now i covered it over and over and i keep saying it that is not dealing as a point those two covenants is not a covenant for the woman to have to be under one way to get saved and the man under a covenant the other way to get saved now i don't believe that he said you don't believe what the prophet said well go ahead you know what you listening to me farth is that a way you know i just tell you like i believe it because i've got the answer for this it's not something that you play pretty around on i've got to answer for for my way of doing it and i have to answer to you amen all right see there's only one salvation covenant that's through the blood of jesus christ all right now but then because of the problem of the marital situation that took place in the garden it puts the man under one covenant the woman under the other all right we gave it sunday where the man's covenant was what it says you'll have to work you'll have to do this you'll have to do that and the prophet said that's what it was covering all right but to the woman it says you'll be in childbearing and things like that and sorrows two covenants all right then it brought it down to word that being that it brought polygamy into being in the man and the animals also that's what i kept trying to get you to see that that eve in the garden according to spoken word is original seed the prophetess was covering it that she had intercourse of the mind first before that anything else could take place so the original serpent seed was not cain cain was the seed of the beast between the beast and eve that was the natural thing but the serpent seed goes back to the point of what if paul said i was scared that satan threw his septility all right and in doing that then we see that what he's done is accepted satan's lie right according to the word and because of that she was placed under a separate covenant of life now i kept trying to bring that out sunday you know wouldn't allow what to talk about salvation it was talking about a covenant of life you know because she was co-equal with him before the fall do you agree right that's what the prophet said coequal all right coequal means that one's just the same as the other right all right but then when she went over and done what she done it brought polygamy into the human race it was about genesis 4 before layman's took two wives so really it was a polygamy in the garden amen polygamy started about genesis 4 with laments when he took two wives for adam and eve it wasn't polygamy we went in sunday through those big old words you know that trying to describe what the the the word polygamy or means and how did a man that's married to more than one wife is p-o-l-y-g-n-y for a woman to have more than one husband is p-o-l-y-a-n-d-r-y coming from the word polygamy all right we tried to prove a point because you can't talk in bible terms of adam being wrong or david being wrong if we come on over you can't use polygamy in relationship to to saying that it was wrong for man to have more than one wife back there that that's not the wording but when it comes down to the point that you you use it that the woman having more than one husband that that ain't even considered that's adultery see because that wouldn't be called polygamy for the woman to have a whole bunch of husbands i know you went in the webster you go ahead i looked it up i gave it to you sunday it's an interchangeable form of word but it doesn't give them scriptural meaning in the scriptural meaning eve committed adultery right he said well no no no because fornication is and her and adam wasn't married yet yes they were your prophet called it adultery that she committed all right now then when it comes into polygamy as i ask you the question if it's not a spiritual condition or existence why did the animal come into the basis of polygamy you know what caused the animal to turn into that i know what caused a man to layman's wanted more than one wife so he got more than one wife he started the polygamy deal all right but what about the animals see then it had to be a spiritual condition by the releasing of a spirit you remember how i tried to bring that out i don't know of any other way of expressing it if you do i'd be glad to talk with you about it i love some other terms or something but it was a spirit released when eve done what she done it brought into being a inroad of satan and to be able to even penetrate the the uh mind capacity or whatever you'd call it of the animal race and it caused them to go into a polygamy state all right but now then in doing that see that is i i've got something let's see what i'll write down when it you read it in the prophet we read in a minute it looks like polygamy is a covenant but polygamy is the downfall of the covenant the uh attribute of the covenant it's not the covenant because it it it won't hold true all the way through now you can say well well brother brown said it in the well sure that's fine just like it uses polygamy and it could be either way but go through the bible and find where the polygamy in the bible means for the woman to have more than one husband she's commanded to not have how could you have the word polygamy applying to her then it's applied to the man to have more than one other more than one wife so you can't apply that's what i'm saying see that's why i try to make things hard but make it to where you won't misunderstand what i'm talking about and somebody out there on the internet sometimes you hear me say it then they they will well listen what he said no boy he well all right i'm hoping for anybody to come and help me but just remember don't come with silly little childish play toys of some little i've got a statement come and let's sit down and talk about the word had a theologian years ago and he was a greek theologian challenged us on the word and i accepted his challenge and it never came to pass he said i only want it on the scriptures i said that's exactly where we're going to with the scriptures i don't know tops and shadows i said well we'd have problems there because brother brandon believed in them but you see church if it's not in the scriptures what do we need let's eat drink and be murray go ahead and do what you want to because basically people are anyway all right but just like what i said the polygamy fell on the basis that the man could have more than one wife because she was the cause see she caused that to take place right she left her holy estate caused it to take place all right just like now i kept emphasizing that in the animal kingdom once the animal was used the beast to bring forth what it did then god used the animal for an atonement that's simple terminology see all right but then we kept emphasizing that's what i want to do tonight i want to keep on laying it down on the point that polygamy under that polygamy man could have more than one wife all right but now he's got to marry correctly amen now let me put this in we'll get back to it later i don't mind dropping anything because i'd love to you say a man could just marry anybody he can't marry just anybody no matter whether he's a priest or he's a goofball or what you want to call him a country boy he's supposed to marry a virgin he's commanded to marry a virgin right he said no no no no wait a minute now now he he could he could marry a woman that's her husband dead that's right if her husband is dead the prophet covers it we'll get back to it if her husband is dead she was a virgin when it started and that husband dies in god she's still a virgin that's what god thinks of the woman he's not throwing off on him so bad is he right so the the man marries he marries a virgin if she was a virgin to start with the only stipulation you got for the the preacher you get down into that but don't just put it to the preacher only that he's got a married virgin everybody is to marry a virgin i don't care who you are all right that's why brother branham said and i'll give it to you man he said in the marital situation that says if anybody's got any reason he said why did they take that out of the marriage vows if any man's got any reason why this should not proceed and we know the prophet said if you you women invisible union we have time to get back to it tonight don't we get it sunday he said if you don't tell that man he said as much as ten years later which that was just a statement right well now what it's been is ten minutes and ten to ten years and three days i'm okay we're not dumb right he's just saying that she ever tells him she wasn't a virgin when they started he has a right to divorce her and remarry that's an invisible union see so you better talk it over that's why when people come to me to do a wedding i said first off either one of you ever been married either one of you ever been engaged if you are you better cover it right now because i won't do the wedding now anything else is responsibility of you to explain to your husband or your wife but i have no right to proceed i don't believe any further than the questions i asked because it's up to the girl and the boy to get together and decide the rest of it all right now we see the man because of the polygamy problem because she caused him to be that you know without getting hard on it but just she brought him into the lustful situation i try to keep back away from words but i can't own some of it she produced a product that brought him into a lustful situation you agree with that so it's her fault she caused him to fall she's the one that brought it to pius so that way then we kept covering it over and over there is no divorce for a woman whatsoever she can't divorce her husband and remarry we'll get to it in the minute paul said if she does she's got to be reconciled remain single the bible's right you don't have to worry about what it's saying you just need somebody to be able to study a little bit and think things over what said and that way don't cross the scriptures right well i believe brother branham said so and so says he can but she can't i'll agree she can't but says he can now he didn't say there why that who could do what that's the way people think right that it didn't say cause of fornication or something he just said he can well if that be true then i i'd like for you to hand me your bible and we'll just rip out a few pages and start all over again you don't like that kind of language do you what a brother told me one time about the bible and i said he said that ought to be took out of the bible i said give me a bible i'm serious i'd have been glad to bought him a brand new one but i tore that page out of his bible because he said it will not be in there well if it will not be in there tie it out but if it's in there we need to live by it or at least try you know that's why nobody can throw stones at nobody when it comes to marriage and divorce that's right because come on your prophet said even a kiss is potential adultery now i know i shouldn't be this way but i am when he said a kiss is a potential adultery was he talking about the girl being kissed or the boy being kissed or who and being kids i took it he talked about both of them kissing cause it takes two to kiss i mean am i wrong all right you see you try to keep people from going off on the deep end and then i become your enemy because i tell you the truth but you try to save people i tried my best to save a church one time that was even talking about polygamy i mean talking about who was going home with who all right and i've done everything in the world i could that night in the minister's meeting to try to destroy that doctrine even to say and why would a man walk with more than one mile you got to be a lustful sex addict if he wants more than one wife you see you shouldn't talk that away well that's why not it's true but you know that man wouldn't speak to me for five years or more or eight years and i finally had to call him before he even talked to him and you know what he said his boy told him said it's brother dale he said brother i could hear him on the phone he said brother who he got the phone i said brother dale you try to save people's lives and they turn against you okay if you turn against me because trying to tell you the truth you come and show me where it's not the truth no problem i can apologize for a lot of things but i will not apologize for the word there's no way you say you're going to empty the church it's been empty before we started empty you see i don't want to lose nobody i want everybody saved i would to the to god i could preach to the entire world on marriage and divorce to just get them to see the truth yeah and then they could do something about it but now listen let's just start reading i know we read this sunday but let's read it over again go ahead with number one noun marriage and divorce paragraph 10 i mean 202 and 203 2 204 we'll drop off five of this quote it now you see then after the beginning it was something else was introduced now this is going to shock you are you tired then when the double covenant was made by man and woman through sex another covenant all together not original covenant but another covenant now that's introduced polygamy he didn't say the covenant was polygamy he said it's introduced polygamy because of the covenant between the man the covenant with the woman being two different covenants then it brings polygamy it don't bring polygamy for the woman it brings polygamy for the man she has no right but for one husband period right other than him being dead but it's not said about him then after the beginning polygamy was introduced both in man and in beast after the beginning to fall now god now secondarily sets a new nature again a new nature is the polygamies and the things and the new natures is what we was covering on the message sunday you know that the women's supposed to not cut their hair the random cover that remember suddenly but the man are supposed to they're supposed to cut their hair off he said it was related to marriage and divorce i didn't make those statements your prophet wouldn't have done it what sets a new nature again what by sex god created the first without sex do you believe that congregation says amen now it's another covenant with nature and he sets it in another order by sex second covenant one male many females one buck deer a whole hiram of does is that right one bull a whole herd of cattle cows or one rooster and a yard full of hens is that right one david after his own heart with 500 wives with a hundred children born in one year to him and one you know more than one year to him from different women a man after god's own heart one solomon with a thousand wives but notice it wasn't so at the beginning but now it's after the beginning the woman has done this then she just becomes what she is now she done it she caused it she becomes that point all right now going down to yeah this is paragraph 204 really that's the way it was at the beginning but now not now in this life we live in now that's the way it was that was back there the polygamy's came into being and everything but not right now because i don't believe in polygamy today right amen he said well you're going to do away with the type of christ i'm not going to do away with it it's going to magnify it right notice don't fail this now take it all down in your hearts but not one of those women could even have one more husband he is the original creation not her not one of those women could have one more husband but that one husband could have a thousand wives that's thus saith the lord that's the bible okay now he goes on to explain the law to show you how that is ties together the law that was even in the land that the king tried to take abraham's wife sarah say remember because abraham lied said that's my sister remember he tried to take her god told him said you're a dead man said that's my prophet's wife he runs back real quick and said why did you fool me he said you know he ran around and said even in the the world it's a set thing that you don't fool with a man's wife right but you get it he said it was thus saith the lord that he could have more than one wife but she could never have one husband other than that husband be dead now how does he get more than one wife today when i'm just telling you i'm i'm just maybe too old-fashioned and i don't believe polygamy is right in the new testament did you understand the wording the new testament see jesus at calvary fulfilled the type right of david solomon etc and the bride of christ fulfills the type of david's wives and all of them you know all right so then you wouldn't have polygamy being legal today in the new testament but you still have the fact of the time that goes over that jesus christ has a many-membered bride all right that's no problem with holding that type over that covenant over because it's what that spoke of back there what that was why that it was allowed to come into being are you listening i didn't say cause to come into being i said allowed to come into being because of the fall of eve as i said a moment ago she brought the human race into the situation she brought out the lust of the of adam to the point that he lived with her and he's never recorded having any more wives or nothing nobody wasn't recording to a layman's but when he did layman's had two wives all right but she caused it so then polygamy would wind up being as to speak of christ and his church but now you show me in the new testament because that's what we're going to go through scriptures you show me in the new testament that it's legal today to have more than one wife why would you want to number one lust devil is what it is and how could a lush devil be anything in god to be right god just permitted that to happen back there to type christ in his church but we're not we're not trying to type today i thought we was his bride are we typing his bride then who's the bride right right it probably said your tops and your shadows has got to fall right where can you have a man in the new testament with more than one wife now i said with more than one wife at a time we'll get technical i've been through this before so i don't mind doing it not to be sarcastic but be truthful the bible says if a deacon desires the office or a bishop let him be the husband of one wife but it don't say that about the woman it says having been the wife of one husband there's a difference in it all right but now watch then as we get to it go ahead to number two choosing of a bride 1965 425 paragraph 133 through 137. he's trying to show you the types in the shadows notice now again that's the natural bright types are spiritual wait a minute okay the word says that she has made she was made for man and not man made for her okay now i'm going to speak and why in a few minutes on the bride of christ but i'm trying to show you the background of it a woman was made for man and not man for woman that's the reason under the old laws now watch it that polygamy was legal why because she was made for man what would it be if she'd have stayed in that estate and not sinned you wouldn't have had polygamies in the things right right so it's her fault amen but what look at david sitting down there with 500 wives and the bible said he was a man after god's own heart with 500 wives and solomon with a thousand but not one of them women could have another husband so there's no grounds for the woman right number three huh that's paragraph 137 but go ahead number three i'm trying to short we have to back up our number three would be the 70 weeks of daniel there you go recent 1961-806 paragraph 209 the divorce courts of america produced more divorces by our women than all the rest of the nations the morals in our country is lower and divorces than it is in france or italy where prostitutions on the streets so but they're prostitutes ours is married women trying to live with several men and several married men trying to live with other women in the nation where they had polygamy it's a thousand times better look at your prophet but don't fail to read the rest of it and yet polygamy is wrong we know we understand what he's doing he's a common human being he's a straight talking man he said in the countries where they practice polygamy he said it's better off why because you ain't got a bunch of prostitution running around he's not saying it's okay he's saying it's wrong but he's just telling you'd be better that would stop all of the men running around the women running around if you had polygamy tonight wasn't stopping women you better remember what i said the other day you might have thought it's comical but i made a good point i thought the old testament polygamy was legal for the man to have more than one wife but there's never been anywhere that the woman could have wanted more than one husband that's death so song is a problem you would have no problems in these countries where polygamy is legal sister what do they do with women that's got you know they got man's got half a dozen wives but his wife goes and runs off some other man what they do with her they killed her you don't have the problem you see what he's telling he's saying in the places where they had polygamy you're doing well with all of this adultery stuff but he said polygamy is wrong look at the next one number four which is the supernatural preaching 56 129 paragraph e47 speaking to someone the other day about polygamy i said the nation and a whole would be better off if it practiced polygamy okay it would we're the highest rate nation in the world with divorces marrying and intermarrying and marrying intermarrying because we try to make the men of the world outside coincide with christian doctrine now what does he mean our constitution was brought about by christian people and they tried to make the world line up to it but didn't do too good in africa and that's the only way i say africa i mean the whole continent they weren't having no problems with adultery and stuff they said polygamy is legal so we try to institute ourselves okay you can't put the nature of a lamb in a pig polygamy would be better off for him right leave him alone we can't run him you may not believe it but god will look at polygamy and excuse it a lot quicker than what he would and remember don't you say i believe in polygamy i don't now he didn't believe in polygamy why because polygamy in the new testament is no place to be but yet the places in the world where polygamy was run and run there was no adulteress and things like that because the women sure didn't go out too much they get killed right but the way it is now they can just do anything you want to seeing you know that's a good little sister you know of course in america you know like people in the message they say my wife has never been married before of course i know she had two kids but separate men but she was never married before sounds like we're still in the garden right sorry i got too good of a memory he said don't you say that i believe in polygamy because i don't why because there's no place in the new testament to place polygamy i want to see it in the scriptures i covered what i said there we run through the old testament polygamy as a type to be christ in the church we're not typing anymore we're already dire it won't be greater when we get there we're already fulfilling that there's not anything else to type right so then when paul deals with it he talks about his husband and his wife brother around him deals with it he talks about a husband and wife now come on if it wasn't that away i want you to explain why brother branham had to bring the grace of marriage and divorce and also why that he would say to people have been married before no take your wife and go home come on we need to get in the message don't we let's read a few scriptures let's see what the new testament speaks of it ephesians go ahead to number five ephesians 5 31-32 for this call shall a man leave his father and mother and he shall be joined unto his wives oh did i read that wrong let him be joined unto his wife and they 82 of them shall be one flesh now that's not exactly what's up there before you and anybody on the internet listen and you read your bible find out that's brother dale trying to hang you it says shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning you go back to the beginning you've got man and woman as one flesh even after she was taken from him and put in flesh there's still one flesh right did adam say that he said she's now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh are we in the scripture paul paul says this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ in the church one man one woman right go ahead ii corinthians 1 or 1st corinthians 2. go ahead at number 6. first corinthians 7. now concerning the things wherever you wrote unto me is good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless to afford to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband and that's as simple as can be first timothy 3 number 7. first timothy 3 and 1 and 2. this is a true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he desires a good work a bishop then must be blindless the husband of one wife vigilance sober good behavior etcetera that's kind of been left out of it dwayne the husband of one wife as i said it's over in the scriptures father he said about the woman having been the wife of one husband doesn't work go to number eight and see what the prophet says on marriage and divorce paragraph 2 32 no now you notice in first corinthians 7 10 notice paul commands the wife that is that divorces her husband to remain single or be reconciled not to remarry she must remain single or be reconciled back to her husband she cannot remarry she must remain single but notice he never said about the man because if he has a legal right to put his wife away a scriptural right but there is nothing for her there's no scripture you can't make the word lie from the beginning of sex law by polygamy now the word of god runs true with the nature of god runs in to continuity all right let's read the scripture he just quoted the way to number nine which is first corinthians seven 10 11 and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord not him no more right let the wife depart let not the wife depart from her husband but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife is that scripture yes but brother dale you sure be tying up a lot of women in the bad places i didn't cause the fall well i didn't either because i wasn't back in the garden you know one thing that i remember i keep in mind at one time maybe you don't think like this i'm sure you probably don't but i wonder what i would have done in the garden instead of blaming adam and eve you don't ever think like that you don't don't ever think about what you would have done if you was eve now under the thinking you got right now you might change things but come on what would you doing ladies men what would you done if you'd have been adam so we accept the fact that we're under the curse because of that you know what you want to call it let's go to romans 7 while we're at it paul is pretty plain let me number 10 no you're not brethren for i speak no you're not brethren before i speak to them that know the law how does the law have dominion over a man as long as he liveth now we're going to leave that out of it we automatically erase this and go to that now what is he saying to the man what is he saying he's under the law as long as he liveth what was the law show me where moses said you could put your wife away for any cause other than fornication we've got deuteronomy 24 here in the back show me where he said anything show me where the man has got a right to destroy his wife his wife for burning the bread because she don't look good because the neighbor woman looks better what is it no you're not brethren for i speak to them that know the law and that the law had dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath in the hood when is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth well if the husband be dead she's lost from the law of her husband that's fine that way a woman can remarry if her husband dies that's right right not like a man down at work one day he said well see that would if that be true said women just take a gun and shoot him and he's dead i can go get married i said yeah but you're a murderer which one you're gonna face god has you know people are you'd be surprised what goes through people's mind when you start talking about marriage and divorce all right but if the husband be dead she's loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she'd be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she's free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she'll be married to another man if your husband dies you can remarry sister but that's the only reason because there's no divorce for the woman the word if she can remarry which she can remarry if he's dead all right god's correct and honest but like i say take a gun and shoot him his dad or say i'll just pray the lord get him off the scene i don't think that would be the right christian attitude right not quite all right look at the next one taken from invisible union read this book before we get time to get there on the invisible union so we will be tying it together natural and spiritual invisible union preached in 1965 1125 paragraph 151 now notice the bible said it plainly says here that her first husband must be dead not just put away he's got to be dead no grounds for her whatsoever no grounds for the woman whatsoever to divorce her husband and remarry if she divorces she must remain single or be reconciled back to him is that plain enough does anybody need a light bulb turned on no we need a whole lot of them put out and you know what i mean by that put out our own ideas and our thoughts yes but brother dale none of us ain't got no hopes there is no hopes outside of jesus christ that's right there is no hope whatsoever outside of jesus christ i want a brother standing after talking with me the other day and he said brother dale he said i heard you preach this before but he said this time and it really opened he said everything in that bible is marriage and divorce said you're exactly right see the new birth is marriage and divorce amen why because you've got to be dead to be married to christ your old husband has got to be dead to be married to christ that's right so it's all marriage in the forces no problem amen now watch what he says on marriage and divorce this is number 12. now we see that there's no grounds for her whatsoever and in the new testament we don't believe in polygamy is that do you understand me well you believe that it's up to you new testament there's no polygamy we're in the the antitype that they were a type of and when you go tight you go to antitype you don't go back to type right and there's no anti-anti-anti-anti-anar to make more types out of it so get off of it now what about him can a man just put his wife away forever cause they said he said it wasn't so from the beginning well moses now gave us the writing of divorcement i'm honest not sarcastic plain and blunt i want to see that in the bible i want to see your interpretation of the new testament even to put it back in the old testament maybe that's contrary to your thinking but what i mean even if you're trying the new testament to go back in the old testament you're going to kill yourself with your word with the word because in the old testament that man could not marry no woman but a virgin i explained that a moment ago if the woman was a virgin she marries if she her husband dies the man marries her she's still a virgin i explained that that's what your prophet said when you come down to a preacher he can't marry any woman that's got a living husband or had a husband don't run it with the virginity of trying to to say this virgin within all the prophets playing in marriage and divorce he's not to do that all right there is only one scripture that you've got to go on that he can marry the wit of a priest but you better make sure your virginity is lined up correct and marrying the wit of a priest all right that's just being as blunt as i can without having to be what so now listen what can a man what is his causes we love to get that there's no grounds for her at all we love to do that but what about the grounds for a man see she's got a living husband take a marriage divorce paragraph 227. man can marry her care what she does and who she is don't leave nobody out right she's got a living husband there's no grounds for her at all but it's not said for him oh i said right there it is bro it's not sad for him so he can just go do what he wants to now i want the scripture where he can i've done stated it to start with the only one jesus said except it be for fornication ours we'll quote in a minute where he said saving which is the same word except or saving which is two different scriptures but speaking it but it's not for him causes her not him get it you have to make the word run in continuity see nothing's saying he couldn't but she can't see because it's her not him that's exactly what the bible says calls it her it's not stated against him to remarry but her why christ in the type now whether we get an invisible union with that he put away the lutheran because they were fornicators and he married the westminster he put away the westlands and married the pentecostals why because there were fornicators you got to get your type running right notice it stated that he cannot remarry only a virgin that's where people don't even go through and even list the scriptures paul speaks of a man having a virginity the same as a woman having a virginity but the boy's okay i mean he's had it he's had a bunch of girlfriends okay with him but the girl's not supposed to have no boyfriends now i want scripture he's a fornicator to do that what else would it be come on my words i don't know but what else would it be only a virgin he can remarry he can remarry again if it's a virgin but he can't marry somebody else's wife no indeed and if he does marry a divorced woman he is living in adultery i don't care who he is the bible said whosoever married her that is put away live it in adultery there you are not no divorcee all right so what he can only marry a virgin now we're getting the grounds for him and the grounds for him starts off hard and blunt not the fact that he can divorce his wife because she's done something wrong and then he goes and marries anybody else he wants to we're all commanded to marry virgins the first time or the 14th time see that's getting off of the women just a little bit ain't it gonna give you sisters a little rest the rest of the night but i thought we were christians i thought we wanted to know what was right why not right if we find out we're wrong there's hopes we've got some way of doing something about it but if we go on through life thinking we're right well how can we straighten up this or straighten up that i don't have no answers like that but i have a god that can make a lot of answers right so we'll deal with him program 243 marriage and divorce number 13. but to get this marriage and divorce straightened out so that you'd know what was right and which was wrong no which was right and which was wrong now he plainly shows here in these types there is one christ and many members of that wife notice he can put us away for spiritual fornication and false doctrine anytime he wants to but how dare you try to put him away and make it the man can put away his wife and marry another one but not the woman put away her husband and marry another one yeah but he didn't he didn't say anything about what he's already said it the bible's already said it that's right see all the shadows and the types are perfectly balanced up see the original creation not the byproduct nowhere not the church the bride through the word not the woman the man each time that's why it's never said anything against a man doing it it's always the woman that's exactly but she can be the bride of christ by being and remember she being a part of a man now listen you sisters want to know how to straighten up things now you read this real careful and you'll get the right answer the male was the only one in the old testament the only one period that can be circumcised right and the circumcision was the covenant so the woman had to be under her father until the time came his he was he was her head then when she married the man the man became her head there was no head outside of that that's right right are you with me so now look what the prophet has to say she can be the bride of christ by being remember she's being a part of a man you remember she was taken out of him all things right nevertheless i suffer not a woman to teach or to serve any authority but to be in silence for adam was first formed and then eve and adam was not deceived but the byproduct was deceived notwithstanding she shall be saved if she continues in a holiness sobriety and in childbearing in all such why because then she becomes a part of this man of course former pastor had years ago used to get up you know he preached about women and everything else preaching about baby supposed to have babies and the old days when we first got started if the girl wasn't married by the time she's 16 she's something wrong with her and by the time she's 20 she had to have four kids and that's no joke because that's the way they taught it and brought down a lot of things on a lot of people right all right but brother he'd get up and preach about it you know so one day he was standing up there and he read that scripture she shall be saved in childbearing and he just stopped and looked around i proved my point he never read the rest of scripture when i got outside i asked him a simple question i said brother would you mind reading the rest of that scripture that you quoted half of it what do you mean i quote a scripture you said a woman shall be saved in childbearing that's what it said that's to read the rest of the scripture it says if she continuing the faith do you need that scripture do we need to get that is it enough to read it off what he's saying that if she's in sobriety and holiness and goodness is that enough for him to say it you need the scripture it says if she continue in the faith not in having babies he said to having babies makes her one with the man come on did your prophet say invisible union go read it he said a woman who won't have a man a child get rough tony i got my own interpretation about a woman that won't have a child for a man and i don't believe in having 49 kids that's plain we got three but i got my own interpretation there it's brother dale for a second okay if my wife when she would never have done that she would never refuse the child to come but had she refused a child to come and there was another child to come through me by predestination what's going to happen to her okay that's brother dale we'll charge you a dime for that but listen the bible says now let's get back we've got just a minute go on to number 13. hey i add these in a lot of times even though i do cut and splice and do all kinds of things i have to put an a on there to where to keep up with matthew 19 3 says the pharisees also came unto him tempting him saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause jesus said it's not so from the beginning they said well why did moses give a writing of divorcement he said because of the hardness of your heart but i want to ask you a question there did the the divorce the correcting of the madden voice problem with moses was it for everybody right they thought it was that's right but around them says this is for my followers only this is not for the world that's right right of course i follow him i just don't believe his doctrine but i sure do believe in his marriage and divorce because i had four wives not come away just one yeah of course i still got the other three in the closet you said silly but that's what's happening moses what did you do did you tell him it was all right to marry just for any you know divorced and married for any cause now jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning they was trying to trap him by saying moses says all right for any cause he said went so from the beginning so they just kind of we better make another approach well bones just said we could do it he said because of the hardness of your heart now if anybody went there on that day 1960 what was it five or what 65 anybody went there with two or three wives or two or three husbands and if they really believe what the prophet said they could go home frequently don't you believe it but what if he went there with the hardness of the heart they went back home with just as many wives and then under worse condemnation but yet they told everybody we're free and i'd go do it again i'd go have all i want bible what is the only grounds for a man number 14. matthew 19 9 and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication then shall marry another committed adultery do so marrieth her which is put away does commit adultery there's no other grounds it's using the word except the word except means for any other cause or for you know some specific point go on to matthew 5 31 it has been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife's saving for the cause of fornication causes her to commit adultery and whosoever whosoever shall marry her that his divorce committeth adultery is that plain enough is that bible do we need any more scripture but what if you get a scripture like this throw it up in your face look number 16. this is bible mark 11 10 11 and 12. and he said un to them whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committed adultery against her what if you get that scripture by itself and if a woman should put away her husband and be married to another she committed adultery now you believe that scripture now you see why that we have to take like i did the other day you know one scripture over here another scripture over here to explain this scripture back here now this here is not wrong because jesus has already explained it are we old 14 chapters later if it be for any of us lesson 14 should be right about any time but you see church what is fornication what is fornication all right we know automatically fornication is unclean living that's sensible direct statement got a couple in here on it if you need it but you say but brother dale's fornication a woman that's married can't commit fornication i mean he can't commit adultery she can only commit fornication you're reading but what did eve do in the garden the prophet said she committed adultery yeah but it couldn't have been bad guy because he wasn't married well he didn't have much choice of who he married god just took her out of him and set her down there and said that's your wife go back to reading genesis and see if that's not what it's saying he's to leave his father and mother amen and cleave unto his wife is that scripture all right we'll get to it sunday where an engagement is a wedding but we're trying to get with it tonight about what grounds does a man have to divorce his wife and remarry only for fornication fornication is a word called unclean living if they pull these up fast enough to keep up with me okie dokie wrote a number 20. we'll go through a couple of these if you don't get there i'll read it this is taken from the worst center in the city 1956 to 18 evening let me tell you something a lot of you you women tonight would have an awful time doing that you'd have to stand on your head you know what he's talking about to her shame on you the bible hair is given to a woman for her glory and the bible writes gives any man a right to leave and divorce and leave his wife that'll cut her hair that's the bible that's what did he say thus saith the lord he said too bad we got away from a lot of this and questions and answers 53 729 he said i had a hotline down on that the other day in shreveport they were talking about the women they said women were long hired and i said that woman that bobbed her higher her husband had a right and a bible right to divorce her now watch him drop on down to the bottom but read that now because we don't want to go out on a limb do we so let's stay off the limb and a woman that's a dishonorable that's dishonorable has a legal right to be put away in divorce but he can't marry again now you can't put your wife away for cutting her higher and remarry you can put her away because that's fornication what about the scripture and i know i don't have a quote from brother branham on this one but what about it he said it was thus saith the lord a man could put his way wife wife away for cutting her then he says he can't marry again just for that reason that's not a reason so all right and i can give you a 50-something i think quotes on it before that he has a right to put her away and sometimes he'll say even maybe honored of god to do so but why would you want to put your wife away for cutting her hair was she just honoring me maybe you're not acting like abraham you start acting like abraham you might have some grounds to walk on i hope everybody understands that point people are hunting excuses to get rid of their wives or husbands you say well i can put her away man but you can't marry again so now you're single so you're going to remain single the rest of your life as far as i'm concerned and you're going to get married and ain't going to do it and i'm going to tell you where you're standing he said well what i'll do is i'll just i'll divorce her and then she'll she'll see i have to have a man and so she'll get her a man then i can divorce i can really get married again because you to do uh according to about two scriptures we read that you would cause her to commit adultery now if you caused her to commit adultery by withholding your body from your wife you know things husband wife you withhold your body and you understand me right and you caused that person to go out and do wrong you're caused without doing wrong and you're guilty and you'll never go nowhere with god until you straighten that up plain enough don't play plain enough you called her to commit adultery then you're guilty of what she's doing now she runs off away from you know i told you so i believe that a man could put away his wife for committing adultery against him and remarry if it's for fornication not cutting to the hair now you might have grounds because the prophet said honored of god not to live with a woman to go out here and dress like these women do today you want them he said my wife come in with him clothes on she'd be divorced run it in the book and quote you'll see what about the bible where it says whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after his heart's committed adultery already with her and you caused him to do it you're guilty would that fall under fornication but they don't preach on women dressed in hairs and clothes and stuff like that too much but when i do i put it hard right too hard i guess you go out there and show your body to somebody and they lust after you you've got a problem you're going to have to straighten that up with god why would you want to do that in front of a center in front of anybody why why would you want to go out and undress yourself in front of men that's your husband's property you're out displaying it yeah but brother dale is not what did the prophet say about fornication and adultery he said the word could be applied either way the difference between fornication and adultery the word could be applied either way but to make it clear this is number 17 if they get it back to our own advice enough when he was talking of what he was talking of there that a woman that's unmarried cannot commit adultery because she has no husband to commit adultery against that's good it's uncleanness for her now watch what's the rest of it she has to confess that to her husband before they are married if she did that if not her husband finds it out later he has a right to put away because she took a false foul fornication and adultery well now brother that my wife she or she committed a daughter or was it fornication it's just what does it make any difference you mean god's going to stand up before the lutheran and said let's see was it adultery you was committing there was it fornication just committed if i could decide which one i judge you silly as i said eve committed adultery we'll get to it sunday if a woman and a man is engaged they're married as far as god is concerned what are you going to argue to plead the case of fornication and adultery i told a man just recently was talking with him i said brother they told me it's a long time ago they told me you couldn't pastor a church because you wouldn't married brother priest right here said that he said he couldn't couldn't preach couldn't pastor because he wasn't married i said well jesus wasn't married now what are you going to do with that and i said besides that paul wouldn't marry yes paul was married i said i'll bring you the proof and i did and i give it to him do you think it changed his mind about anything nope but i gave him where the prophet said paul was not married you think it changed him no it didn't change it you ain't gonna change people it takes god to change people any of us you argue over adultery or fornication your prophet said she that wasn't married would be fornication he said but if she don't tell that man he's got a right to divorce her what about this license invisible union number 22 if they get it up there she has a sacred trust paragraph 83 84 5-6 he has a sacred trust a virtue committed to her by the lord a certain virtue nothing else holds it but a woman right that's committed to her by god she must not defile that virtue and if she even does something wrong she must confess that to her husband before he takes her and make it right the same as the church that was married to the law has to come also before christ before the second marriage she has to confess that if she doesn't and she lives with her husband for 10 years and then confesses it he has a right to put her away and marry another woman that's the way the scripture fornication unclean living why would we want to play with anything why would we want to play with it he's minded to put her away privately see after he'd already engaged to her when you're engaged to her as far as god is concerned you're married to her is that the way your prophet says we'll get that sunday but the only place that you've got anywhere and i'll just do this in a second is deuteronomy 24 i gave it to him but i didn't put a number on it so it'd be the last thing if they can pull it up if not we'll read it the only place that i know of that brother that moses mentions anything about marriage and divorce in deuteronomy 24. all right so let's just read deuteronomy 24 and then we'll conclude our point to see about it when a man had taken a wife and married her and it come to piss verse one let you find no favor in his eyes because he had found some uncleanness in her then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it her hand and send her out of his house now i'm serious i'm serious as a heart attack the old saying go i'd like to know more about moses and the the uh bill of divorcements and the things but this is all i can find it's all i've been able to find after all these 40 years of studying it you know i've tried to find i do have one more but we'll get to that in a second but watch now because he had found some uncleanness in her let him write her a bill or divorcement and give him to her hand and send her out of his house now can she ever marry again no watch and when she's departed out of his house she may go and be another man's wife oh she may go she may go no it's not saying that it's okay for her to do it it's saying she's going to do it right because god would be justifying it if he said it's okay he said well that's the bible you ain't got the interpretation you've got your carnal words and she may go in other words she will go right and be another man's wife you say well how can you prove the rest of it if the latter husband hate her and he writes her a bill of divorcement and giving it in her hand and centered her out of his house or if the latter husband die come on if he dies everything's free come on which took her to be his wife her former husband which sent her away may not take her again to be his wife now why not if everything was okey-dokey so everything ain't okey-dokey after she is defiled for that is abomination for the lord you call sin in the land okay i think i put it up with that unclean let's go ahead and pull this up i'm going to take just a minute and then i'm sorry go ahead and give the the hebrew lexicon this is from the word there where it says uncleanness in deuteronomy where it says uncleanness it's 6172 means nakedness nudity shame pudenda pudenda implying of shameful exposure nakedness of a thing indecency improper behavior exposed undefended figurative that uncleanness had heard not cause she didn't take a bath it was her fornication are you listening something was wrong with her sexually nakedness nudity shame that's what it's saying so there was either nakedness nudity or shame in her past you know somewhere that caused the problem if you didn't you look that word up i get into trouble all the time you look that one up go on the dictionary but if something wrong with her and the man had a right to put her away she went to another man's he married him he died but looked like he'd come back the first one no can't do it because it would pollute the land the bible says now give me the next one and then we'll be through jeremiah 3 they say they say he says they say he says read it they say if a man put away his wife and she'd go from him and become another man's shall he return unto her again they say is not that the same as the pharisees moses said it was okey dokey shall not that land be greatly polluted but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers yet return again to me saith the lord because he always begged israel to return if you want marriage in divorce if you can't see where a prophet got what he said you better read that over and over because even though israel polluted that's what it's talking about but it's taught me international even though israel polluted herself god still dealt with her until the final day when he put her away never to be married again to her marriage and divorce moses brother branham said had a right god counted it righteousness did he count everybody burning the bread or because she didn't smell good or because she wasn't purdy or no no had to have a reason to be able to get rid of her you remember the story that jesus told or is told about the parable of the lady that the headband that had all of the stones in it you know you remember the story that's right and if they don't if she done something wrong and the husband was gone somewhere away you know they'd take her down to the high priest and the high priest would just take one of them stones out said she's guilty of adultery well naturally when the husband comes back home and he finds a stone missing he knows what she done of course nowadays it's all different ain't it them oh high priest of things just fake that that's what everybody says now they wasn't guilty got pictures of people blowing up blowing up and pictures of them sitting down a backpack right but they're not guilty you know well no proof of them being born too old i'm sorry it's post still happened brother would be told about it one time said his daddy his daddy was a comical guy and he said his dad he was riding with this guy and said they started to pull up in the yard at the man's house and said there's still a man on the porch just kissing that fella's wife like everything so they pulled up and they got out and he went up here and he said he was guessing that man she said you gonna believe your eyes or believe what i say i said i wasn't kissing him he said well i guess i was deceived on that i didn't you know i didn't really see it you know what she meant get out or shut up i ain't that dumb we don't play things in marriage and divorce i hope you understand my point man can't just put away his wife just for anything he's got to have a reason and he can't marry again unless it's a virgin now where do you put the people in the marriage in divorce with this message and what they're doing he said well brother dale you're beating on me i didn't do it are you blaming me cause you've done it sorry i stand you're gonna blame me for what you've done go ahead when you get there you're going to need some other court of appeal because that's one thing about lula you can't go and say that we just play all kind of garbage cans about marriage and divorce we're blunt we're straight we tell it like it is but we also know that god has grace and a wonderful amount of grace if you can't see that in jeremiah that i just read god says return unto me or backsliding israel he's standing tonight without stretched hands to the bride of jesus christ around the world trying to get her to come to him and get straight for there can be a body change because that's the problem the problem is marriage and divorce is this body the soul is eternal by the new birth the body is still polluted and tied to this world we got to get that straight what do we got 290 in the red book 290 anybody have a need paul to jesus is oh all to jesus i surrendered take me jesus take me i surrender all to thee i surrendered truly know that but we don't believe it and ask god to reveal it it can't be one more verse before we go to jesus i surrender i surrendered all father we thank you for tonight and we pray that what we've said would be worthy lord to be able to be said and we've tried to say it the right way because we're not trying to make no walk sided a fire out of anything but believe what you've said and just accept what you said then there's always grace every time in israel would run out and do all the wrong you would still stand with the armed outstretched waiting on them to return return unto thee oh backsliding israel to me he said but father that come a day when they wouldn't return then you had no no way of doing but just to put her away in marriage gentile bride we just thank you that we are that bride we love you lord thank you for all things forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness could be with everybody on the way home give everybody a safe journey home and let everything be for your loving grace we love you in jesus name amen you just surrender all all to thee my blessed savior i surrender all all to jesus i surrender now i feel thy sacred flame oh the joy of full salvation glory glory to his name i surrender
