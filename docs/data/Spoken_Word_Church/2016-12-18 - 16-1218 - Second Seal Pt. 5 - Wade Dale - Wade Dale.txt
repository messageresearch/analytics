========================================

I know you and I you know in normal life red and I've told you I want you to think of this while we're talking about it I'll turn it on in a minute but it won't something will come up with my Bible verse 10 the the color red is a two-fold now remember i told you the sanctification is what it's a great place to be but it's a horrible place to stay okay so that's why you take the color red I was looking at the color red last night now one on one side of the street red is what when you think of red you think of know what what stop when you think of red you think of what else blood but when you think of red you go to Valentine's Day the color red has the longest wavelengths of any color and it's the second most popular color but besides blue but when you look at blue you know that blue means a boy and bush guy but when you look at red and we see this red horse we also have to see that red means the blood the sanctifying blood of jesus christ but also go go to those i represents then i'll say the now they want to 18 come now let us reason together seven more though your sins are like scarlet scarlet and what red they shall be as white as snow though they are red like crimson they shall be as wool okay so that's why the brother brown said read through red is why you take the red blood of Jesus Christ and rid of your sins and put them together and then what you get a white righteous person alright so that's the cup away the red cook the color red you keep looking and it also goes the other way toward passion and and it's the most passionate meaningful and sometimes even deadly colored of all as a color aid Cody can be taken two ways same thing with this red horse same thing with all these seal it can be taken two ways sanctification can be taken too late you can stay under sanctification and be diseased and go to hell are you can take sanctification and go on and let it cleanse your sins and go on and walk with God to the baptismal ago and there's your perfect love are the baptism the Holy Ghost which is eternal life that's why I've always said that red color you know the old saying used to be that color insurance was more on a red color car well I don't think that's true but a red car is more noticeable climb because it's a blaring color you can't hide a red car you can hide cars with different colors and different in the parking lot but you can go and scan across the parking lot and you can study you'll stop at that red car pretty much every time until the same thing with with this red horse rider what's he doing he's riding through showing he said look at me look at me I'm going around look at me I'm doing that's what the catholic church did right got the church killed 68 million Jews under this red blood looking horse they physically kill people and spiritually kill people right they said it's it's a two-fold it takes a lot more powerful meaning in the Bible because remember before the children of Israel left Egypt what happened they had to put the blood over the doorpost to rewrite they'll come the Passover symbolizing what the blood of Jesus had to be for us all right the same thing with you look and see that that the red goes all the way over to the red dragon which is the devil the red dragon spews you know water out of his mouth people all right but you have to look and see a saving grace of of red in the Old Testament what did they tell right after day put a blue pink orange no put a red color scarlet cord and brother branham I was reading last night though like nice not but the other day brother I'm said that scarlet red goes off that that red line goes all the way through the Bible see so there's your sanctifying but it's saved right but you know what it done though it killed all the other till they turned it down that's really right so you see that's why I said many times before and sometimes maybe this will be more of an impact that that part of sanctification that we come under as Christian it has a two full minute you can stay there be lost or you can go continue on and take that has got to be part of your process of being a Christian you can't just go from being a you know uh let's just say an alcoholic prostitute drug addict and then go straight you can say well i got saved that's justification that's just our terminology now in the world's terminology they see that you made a change and if you're now that's their born-again experience but see that's where the devil has got them in a lie the lie of that red horse riding that red horse is not riding out over yonder's riding through the churches people people and it's telling them hey you're okay um you know I out of this girl it works with us that she's always talking about the Lord out of one eye one side of her mouth from cussing out the other you know and i can get tired of it sometimes you get tired of eating you know I had another guy said one this I'm uncle Colin with this girl sure have the testimony and I said yes you sure have the testimony I but he wasn't thinking about not lean but by your fruits you'll be no sanctification though is a cleansing process but it's also a process that if you stay there you're worse off than if you'd never been saying before your to fold more child health and then you worse when you begun because you think you're okay you think you all right and that's one the denominational world they'll lay just it okay you're safe safe or what well I used to better know that's good alcohol and honest I'm into something that we but when you come up into this higher level of the opening of the seals though you have to come from not that sanctification that you got when when I put cursing and drink it in but then we smoke but you say put all that together drinking smoking cousin all put all together when I stop doing those things it was a sanctifying process in my life but it wasn't a new birth process it was a process oh and you birth but it wasn't the birth okay okay you can you can have water and blood and stillborn baby right so you in tight but you can't have a water blood and a baby crying and not having you birth you something that birth has got to produce a lot and a continual life but this part of sanctification is like juno come aces geez I die daily you have to die but you have to be washed you have to step under that blood and what brother I'm said the blood was in this hour the bleeding word of God the Word of God is the blood there is no literal blood hey there is no even even there's no red symbol of anything it's the Word of God Jesus Christ was the word the word bled and died and the word came back to living the believers and do what to them do the same thing to them that he did to him amen so that's but you look into in the higher form of the of the seals though when you see that red horse rider you see that there's a process going on that he's going out he the devil is going out and telling the people you're fun right you're okay everything is good you've quit this you quit that you've not doing this i don't know this anymore i don't do that anymore and so you just your ass yeah but the real rest is when you go to all the process the whole process of being born again then you are in a race but you rest from your sins you don't rescue read from you later because you still lately because what did this red horse do this reinforce when that spirit went out in that page right here of Columba if I got that the first three ages type the first field second seal times the fourth church age if I goddamn first three ages the Lion of the Tropic uter the lion opt man eagle and then the eagle goes on up the eagle there's no limit to legal he keeps lying okay but you got your lion ops man and eagle now in this age to get to this here to get to the you get to the capstone that's why that I were talking the other day this is the only time we could be the fullness of the Godhead Bobby okay the bride this is the only age they were the phone is for their time but this this age we got to be the fullness and take everything brother Brown says all for horse/rider so you got a call for combat beef all four I'm a combat these all for combat meats off everything of every age every seat Paul way down here he had a he had a super revelation but it was what the cornerstone right like we talked with which the cornerstone it wasn't the hex country excuse me i rinsed wonderful wonderful brother but he only had cornerstone all right all the way up to here even in the first part brother on his ministry that was the cornerstone coming back as we were jim was reading Zerubbabel the other night you sweep that thing off and what brother round head and go and start right back down there with the church with the church he had to start back down here quite the faith of the fathers the face of the fathers was not up here at that moment it was down here brother right I've had to bring from 47 263 had appreciate Ryan back up to where these were at here to begin with then what happened was what Satan gets on his horses horses and what does he do he takes the effects and brains it all the way back down to here remember he ate the Brian tree down to a lot of stunts stunts where's your stuff back stuffed on top of three stops at the bottom all right so he's started back at the bottom and said I will restore with what with four lion ox man and even you're going to restore with those four he's going to restore everything back now you've restored it back when you could become born again you have all four of those characteristics of the horse riders that is the new birth right okay the Lionhearts menon eagle that is the new birth and you know ryan had a had a question a long time ago the up he had a question that remember in Ezekiel he says how can they be facing in one direction but there's 40 you got you got you got to take the limitations off of God what you need for the time is if going forward it's not really in a box where you box you can't how many of y'all got a box for holy oh no you don't you got it so you got line ops man and eagle either way you look at cuz remember they all go forward you say well this one's going forward what's happened to these they're going side with no that's forward that's followers that's forward to next forward if their eternal well this is the way I look at it Lionel's man an eagle they'll face in the same direction if you need the bonus of the line he step front if you need to go into the office he stepped up if you need the boldness of the man he stepped up if you need to Eagle he steps up in other words what comes to the forefront of what you need that's what steps forward okay so if you'll see that that means they step forward okay so if you'll understand that you'll see that they do offline it in one direction don't remember they fly you chords word because it is work I mean there's work so it flies you towards the worm and it takes you toward the Word of God whatever you need and we're not we're not Catholics to the point we go god I need the eagle no it's just part of you it says the part of you can't piece it and pull it apart but you can see though that what's working in you is the boldness of the line the labor of an ops are the revelation of an eagle are the shrewdness of man you got rid quote yesterday very interesting and it was in things in modern events made clear by property brother Brad said the Lord would bring him something and he said I wouldn't see it immediately now you would think I mean if this guy had a direct tube from God into him you know yeah that one coming but he was still a human being he had to run that through this human filter he said I wouldn't see it he said but then what would happen was an angel said we'll read Isaiah I read Jeremiah read Matthew this is what I was saying and then brother Brown takes what the shrewdness of a man to put that run that through his filter because remember he got he thought Hills was eternal for a long time that was unless you're Baptist denominational theology and brother Graham said I went to preach on until one I saw in the Bible rule he had to hold it goes plan you see it you understand what I'm saying I what I'm trying to tell you is you may fight over thing he said why what I can't understand that I must not be boarding in that's not true right that's not true right at all you just don't understand it for the time and brother Brown said if you get there and you get under that spout enough he said if you want speak in tongues he said if you get under what if you start studying praying and asking God for something you'll give things right so back to the simple red now red stained red to me as a color that that catches your eye number one so what happened in this for of age during the time of Colombo remember that was the Catholic age they were getting the attention of the people right you go kill 68 million people under the under the umbrella of Roman Catholic Church then you put fear into people and that's what Satan wanted to do with that red North you want to put fear into people he wanted to make sure they saw him but what did he do though he was telling them that he was gone yes God's doing this if God is doing all this God's if you don't the Catholic Church's the note is is it if you don't see this then it's better like the Pope said it's better that we kill you then for you to live and be a Protestant now that's a lie the devil he was on his red horse he was riding fast and hard during that time but there was an ox kind of strange have you ever thought about this the red heifer the red heifer is the only sacrifice it's a female what's the heifer I see many all other sacrifices where he goes it was once she dope for a ignorance offering but the red heifer had to be brought up red no more than three hands of that whole heifer could be any other color that's why they're trying to produce it now they know Ben get the red heifer back because the ashes of the red heifer sprinkled into water of separation that starts everything seemed to have a gut you go make sacrifices all day long but unless you go by what the Bible says then the Jews know that once they get that red heifer that they can begin sacrificing brother Aaron said they would remember they will start sacrifices all right but it's kind of strange that she has to be ready and it's a woman i miss a girl it's okay it's well Jesus Christ the male sacrifice came to do one thing right get a what a female breath washer in red blood and she you say what she want to set you up we sacrificed herself daily this one honestly we are the red heifer we have to be burnt yeah in the fiery trials and all these things you know you you look at the redhead from you say man why she have to be a female and Christ comes as the mail well you've got to have Christ in a bride right so that red heifer really symbolizes you and I because remember we can't have no spot that's right without spot or wrinkle why because we're covered in that red blood all right so that's just a little somethin up then go in there i was looking at at at that the other day about the red heifer but she's ready she's clean she's cleansed and then she's the very first sacrifice before because remember why are they looking at Sasquatch so strangers so you get so many allegories and all these things but why is Israel looking to complete all the sacrifices they know the Messiah will come after they get finished with old sacrifice right how's it going to start the red heifer has got to die the red heifer has gotta disappear we got to go in the rack we got to go interactor before they can start then physically yes but it's going to turn into spiritual to where they going to look back and say that was it we don't have to do sacrifice what's the two minutes that's why the Jews are going to hate those two witnesses for 2,000 years they've been trying to get temple worship back and get and then all of a sudden here comes to guys out that says hey that's worthless God's not even in that temple where the temple of the Holy Ghost and then 144,000 come out they get persecuted that's why I've always said that that's why they're going to get persecuted is because man dem jus they I mean what if you worked your for 2,000 years what if you worked and worked and worked and worked and worked at work and finally somebody said that's worthless I do okie for that I promise you get a deal we'll get you for that and not take not take no shame about it at all that's what they're going to do with 2 n's yet but when you see this red shimmy they just came in we look at the the color red is two different in two different spectrums we look at red as being you know remember the scarlet letter the girl in wanting to commit adultery and that that was red so you symbolize red with with passion and non purity but you also take red and it's absolute purity the shed blood of jesus christ is all through that's what that red scarlet brother brown somebody there's not a red scarlet thread all the way through the bible is true blood of jesus all the way from adam and actually the word Adam means read the word out of me and read so there you got red all the way from Genesis to the end of the book you've got that color red but when we talk about these seals though and we get into them let's read the let's read the description see if we get the thing pulled on there I look at that offer there we go all right we're on the second seal now watch when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast safe which was what the office say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given that sound him thereon to take peace from the earth so really it wasn't the horse that took peace from the earth it was the man sitting on the horse okay and he that sat on the horse to the peace from the earth but what is that red horse symbolized power of the people that man has no power on that horse if that horse gets knocked out from under in that's what weird to do where to take that horse and kill it power power if you and i give my brother brown say said if you want to get if you want to not be standing he didn't do the vice versa what are you doing resist the devil he'll flee from you well that's kind of example but if we would do that one little picture then what happens much trouble right now one mo scripter resist the devil you don't have to do penance and do all these things like the Catholic Church you know they start that was what Lucas problem was Luther's problem was that he would grew up and all that if you did this and thought this you have to beat yourself for crawling the floor so when God was starting to deal with him the old Luther was back there so the old lucre was still saying okay god I see that you're revealing something to me something more they gotta go depends you know he kept phone kept falling but God finally and finally one day Martin Luther stood up with the edict which was just a few month like a month ago then he nailed a thesis on the wall in other words he said this is my stand I'm not going back to that anymore this is where it is this is what gods revealed to me you don't have to do penance you don't have to pay money no no Venus which caused or what the Reformation that's why it's called for information could be reforming then all right they want another horse it was random power was given him and sent him to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and there was given him a great sources kill one another it wasn't it really was it good people killing bad people right where did they get the people to kill from the Christian community they killed the Christian so they'll so what are you doing you're looking at to see the only thing with Constantine is when Constantine's sent out the Crusader memory cell division of a cross so he put the cross and while they call cross back that really didn't have nothing I don't think that vision he if he came from God he misinterpreted you understand what I'm saying I can't stay but what if the devil did the same thing and gave him that dream or vision to put across from the bass or what you do in the name of religion they killed 68 million people they killed 68 million Christians they didn't go out then go out to borrow that's why I'm telling you now this is we're saying that he's not the barroom look at the same spirit come back around now not physically killing us but spiritually killing right try to do not going out there in the bar rent i mean the the catholic church was smart enough to know that they didn't have to go into the brothels in the end you know them the houses of robbers and thieves they went right straight to what the christian that's what that horse did kill one another so it was too same looking force you had one that was sitting in their house they had a cross they didn't pray to the croft but knew that that cross was the symbol of what that christ died for their sins but then you had another christian group that comes in with a cross killing you for believing in supposedly the same thing they believe yeah so you see where the deception is alright and that was given unto him a sword or work what happened here in this dog ate all this word of the catholic church comes out they had to latin vulgate right which is the which is the writings of the Bible they had it in Latin they had it but they would not give it to the people the only way they'll give them to the people then Luke on Wesley's day with 10 day of 10th del Y cliff and all those they took and put the Bible together and give it to the Christian people well the kinds of churches no you don't need that you just need to pre season so there was a separation there but that was his word against their work Satan's work against the revealed Word and that's the same thing it is now look how closes in the message false false preachers rainfalls birth all right and it was given him a great sword so that it didn't stop sometimes we think well that horse road and then it just disappeared still get that horse road and disappeared no the problem is is we have to see that when we get to that grizzled color are our brindled color horse it's all three of those colors in one it has become so powerful it's took the symbol of the flight the red and the black and mix them all together and that's what you get alright so the powers are going to head right here this is the power that's going to head up because remember after the fourth writer is gone after the fourth seal the rapture takes place all right I swear it just blows people mind but you can't when you take the seals you can compare them with the church ages but you can't go one from 1141 same way with the Ten Commandments that's thinking the other day the Ten Commandments is not first commandment first seal second commandment second seal no it's written in there you have symbols all through those 10 cuz you can't take 10 commandments make seven seals all right yes but you can combine them and show the same spirit and then you can show the seventh seal because there's not ten sale okay that's on Santa right so I stand I stand by this other day and all of us we have to do this we have to see these things in layers you're selling going you've got a natural happening you've got a supernatural happening or are all right and it don't have to be supernatural eternal Saints a supernatural creature right he ain't naturally supernatural because he works in another realm that's not come it's not defined like our realm it all right so you got the natural happening all these things were coming out where they went out and kill the Christians no that's a natural that happened in history that's written in boats it tells you that Constantine went out on a crusade killed CPA men but they don't call them Christians I don't think they just kind of weave it in but sometimes they were bad they were against the Catholic Church and all this but we understand the supernatural part of it Satan was given what a false word to the people and ingrained them so much so that's my brother i'll call this for days the catholic eight right yeah so that's when the Catholic Church really blocks them and really bloomed and everything come to a head is right here in this church age all right so we see all these pieces that's natural supernatural and then there's a supernatural revelation underneath all that member brother Graham said besides besides a revelation there's a supernatural element that we've got a scene I believe that supernatural element of this message here's our body change that's the supernatural element though we have a revelation though God reveals something to us I believe he revealed to M Martin Luther John Wesley brother Ronald had the apex or the Eagle anointing of the revelation so his was higher than anybody else but we as a group have got to put that revelation together and then there's another element a supernatural element that comes underneath all that you got a regular while you got a red horse now this was not a regular red horse it's not a literal red horse dead right okay you got them but the natural that tells us that in history what happened in history somebody got on a power that was red because of the blood and killed 68 million people we can read that that's just common that's just really history man can't man can't deny that it's kinda like the Holocaust you can't deny it its history it happen but now is that going number one that's not gonna save us that's right but if we take the spiritual part of that the red blood of Jesus Christ cleansing our sin sanctifying us killing us and putting his life in now we're into a supernatural park or you can stay on a supernatural part of the devil okay then everything is okay you can stay right here everything is fine everything oh it's just cozy we can come to church we can yo be there we come every day and be under this condition so see there's that but there's an element down here that what we're trying to get to it's what we're trying to get to it's that supernatural element that this these four horse riders all right these four horse riders has a symbol that you and I must see that's going on in your life they're separating the good from the bad but it's not just separating good for the baddest telling you that there is a combat beef to combat every one of these and it's in you and then when you get those four let me let me before we get there you got four seals in there a rapture takes place you say well we're going we don't need five six and seven no I think you need five six and seven for you body shame that's right 124 is is is getting you up to here cuz you can be right here and not take a body check brother branham was right here and you didn't think about you all right so there's a supernatural element that we've got to bring together in what's already written and I'm sorry to say this but you got to be careful there's a brother said something the other day here in the church and had time talk to him but I will tell my brother branham being would be scripture writing you know it would be you can't do that this is not the Word of God that's right no this is not the Word of God brother branham was not the Word of God he preached the Word of God that's right and this is God sure this is God to us hey the revelation we needed amen but this is god this is not another person another this is not even a prophet this is lee profit that's right okay good remember what to do' brother branham remember they got called in that he said well ram with the revelation you got you can write a twenty-third chapter revelation he said stop it right he said that's Antichrist that's true he said I can't add one word he said read in Revelation where it tells you right then to tell you cuz it dont and thats kinda strange right up to the last chapter says no add don't take away leaving it like it is and i'm going to send you some help yeah I'm gonna send you some help to understand what's already wrote so be careful don't don't and see us why brother and he is close you say what about sins being forgiven well that was the son of man doing his work I was reading in questions and answers Oh last night where brother Brennan was talking about it was right before mayors and divorces being free he said be still he said I have the answer he said I just got to get something in other words he's gotta go up to the mountain and let God say whatever you say that's the way it'll be all right but you said well that's and that is close but he's not God he didn't forgive them of their sins right God forgave them of their sins he won't you know what he done he brought them to a understanding that they could be forgiven man had killed him so much to where you know it was my mind said if I preach it right down the line he said everybody he said you know all out if kissing is a potential adultery I got Sam okay you understand what I mean but brother branham brought an understanding that what God had already said garnered already safe right what to do I stink another day I thought whoa well if they were so staunch in the Old Testament how did that one walk up to the well get preaching is good teaching had that one walk up to the well go and have five husband and once she's living with wasn't hers that's adultery she should have been dat dead yeah is that right and all right you get caught in the act of adultery you supposed to kill him she's in five times and the one she's living with you wasn't even hers why was she still alive what they had took and got Jesus then he said it wasn't so from the beginning yeah but you know the words you've watered it down so much till but now remember she wasn't so bad off that she didn't get forgiveness right yards dead ones home she needed husband number seven and found it yeah she found number seven nipple oil all right and he can read hurt a lot okay we know they may give it to a rock band but potentially you are telling fans cuz you can't you listen you can't give a woman at the well he turn a lot before the disciples they were the word bearers she's not she's sure she went and said come see a man yes that told me off what was she doing she was testifying and you can touch the pot that's fine no problem but she was given eternal life I believe she may went to the upper room but she convinced that in the meeting but she didn't get it before it Peter James gone no sorry they don't happen that's enough that you can take a coat from brother Brown that she got into our life but you've got what you guys go by your layers you got to come down to that supernatural element knowing one thing's for sure then eternal life was given to no one until Christ died and come back on earth at Pentecost and went into the believers hey that's what I've always said my questions been flying if you think you had this see than you all you out we think Peter bullet right James John we think they would already had it in them and walk with the word now what you just said receive you the Holy Ghost I like that name is Papu had the way to clinical it's right all right to where the word can be quickened that they have heard what so the word was there it took life same thing with these horse riders you say well that's death there's life in that take justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost under the death part right and then what the 444 completes the birth now you got the word you got it what thats that revealed part of the word that nobody else had right nobody else had this revealed word right here that we're running through our filter every Sunday every Wednesday we're running this through the filter of our man annoying and worthless I put the spray wrong or we don't understand it like brother branham right now i'll find it i think you same questions and answers instead of instead of martyrdom is feel I've reading questions and answer so my ask him a question and he said well I don't get it up you know in other words I don't get it just like that that's right I have to go study it he'll tell me something and I'll not say nobody why would never how it goes just go I see it no you got to go through this thing good said he changed right head that's right and that's what you got that smile i love what brother Brown said he said face final resting places in the Word of God you can't put your faith in this comes every doctrine that's being preached is preached out of these books on blooming to Seoul seven thunders all being preached on this hey father son Holy Ghost baptism of eternal hell they'll be in priests out of this one yeah so you just be satisfied this year coming up you be satisfied know one thing's for sure if you're born again and you're sitting under a good ministry then and you're being fed then you're at the right place at the right time and let God do the rest let's not try to push this thing let God do the rest let God do it because what we're supposed to be doing Ruth did what Ruth decided right she decided to stay she worked and she rested and why did what didn't they only tell her says hey you just go rest is his time to go do this work Oh ass had to go due to work of kinsmen you and I can't be take the beer cans member down but we can have the kinsman redeemer in us right and what'd you say don't want thankful we go hurry my favorite time there is the fall and not used to bother me cuz it's the sign of death so one day welcome through the woods in North Carolina it came to me that the colors in call our fam burr and red and green and that's the Holy Spirit I see original color and Creed for life follow the harvest time I just believe you know spring is Resurrection and all but fall is when jesus said go out and reap the harvest put the tears over here he said wait till it fully mature when do they pull a matt or october november my weekend is why are you you look at those dates and you you know you get excited about certain things because you can what you rightfully a natural filter yeah but that natural filter is wrong unless it compares with the wording like just left brother Brad brother brown thought his brain Oh hell's got to be eternal I've been caught out on my life and then oh all the angel had to say well cousin angel can't hear you revelation I'm telling you angel did not get ever give brother random a revelation angels brought the word to him and he studied all day putting that thing together and finally I bet you all the angel said was there's an eternal hell it's gotta be eternal life and then brother Brown didn't just jump up and run out I believe he went right through the Bible when you talk man so this is it this is it what same thing can happen you same thing I'll help you when you get a revelation what is it God put the word together because Satan don't want that time that's right right if you get a revelation it's got to be from geico Satan will not you a correct revelation you'll give me a wrong one but he won't give you around never regardless go what kind of get
