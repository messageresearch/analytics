but he they were taking a little family vacation so surprise they went out I think I think they were in Oklahoma right right Wyoming thank you they went to Wyoming for a little vacation so that'll be a good time for them this afternoon wasn't that a fantastic service this morning and amen all right this afternoon I want to kind of maybe tie in some things and just speak from Hebrews chapter 10. and verse 19 to 23 we'll just read those scriptures well God was so grateful to be able to gather around your word once more Lord I pray Lord as we look into these things at your blessed Lord we know that many have needy Hearts but Lord many many are struggling Lord in this hour that we're living in Lord I pray Lord that you'll give us something to help those that are struggling Lord because Lord we know what the prophet said that we shouldn't be struggling there's a reason that we should be able to rest you've given us a recipe for rest and not for struggling Lord help us to be able to just relax into it or relax into what you promised and trust you the way that we ought to Lord granted now let your bless the service we pray in your name so if we read in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 19 it says having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the Holiness by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart and full Assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised he may be seated the Lord as a blessing to the reading of the word now if if we're just um maybe just leave your Bible open or bookmark it or something that just just meditate on those words where Paul is instructing the church he's instructing to have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus and of course we know we've been well taught that this uh the type and shadows in the Old Testament are going from the outer Court to the inner core into the holiest of holies and what that means and what represents that you go into the holy of holies and there that's typing that you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that God himself is coming to abide in you and imparting you with his faith because it's his life and his person and Paul says in verse 20 by a New and Living Way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart so we've got this this afternoon we've got a reason to draw near we've got a reason to be bold if there's anything that you have need of this afternoon we've got a reason to hold fast and really what I'm speaking to this afternoon is is for those that are struggling yeah brother random he would constantly say in this message that I'm reading from the inter they enter Veil if you happen to study that out that would be a good message to really go and study out of the inner Veil that he's laying out one of the things he's laying out in that message that that uh that I just want to take as a as a text to Struggle No More because there's no reason for you to be struggling and brother when I'm in that message he would say he'd say we're just in our infancy talking about the church now you think about this message now if you really go and meditate over the message to Intervale and as you even are sitting here listening to me speak on these things you're you're going to hear that message different way different depending on where you are in your journey it will mean something to you now when brother randomly he's laying this out he's saying we're just in our empathy the church is just in its infancy now you think about wherever you are in your journey if you're living in sin that that God is calling you into the holiest of holies call he's calling you to go through the outer core intercourt the holy of holy now if you're born again though if you're born again he's calling you to a greater to a greater Oneness and greater fellowship with him and that's what brother Branham I believe is speaking to when he says we're just in our infancy we're Rising he said don't worry we can get all these Fanatics and unbelievers out of the way we'll move on up into perfection after a while and you'll see signs and wonders and he said but we're just babies crawling just give us a little while here I think that should give us all encouragement to know that we're not just standing still that something's happening something Supernatural is happening that we're moving on up the more that you eat the word the word in your life is getting greater and greater and deeper and deeper and higher and better all the time now listen to the way brother Branham said this he said the next thing God will step in with higher Miracles and greater things on greater planes and as Jesus when he was here on Earth the first coming of the Lord Jesus it showed John the Baptist miraculous death then the miraculous of Jesus then come in the healing of the sick and the discernment of the spirits then on down into the raising of the dead and from that on down to the earth and the heavens and everything declaring him then the Earth giving up is dead now I wonder if you listen when you listen to that that you could hear you can hear echoed in those in those words three stages of a journey now I I really enjoyed that message this morning I remember talking about the the mirror and looking at the mirror I remember years ago uh listening to a sermon that brother Donnie Reagan preached and he was talking about he was preaching on looking into the mirror of God's word and he compared it with looking through three stages as well and and what what's happening as you keep looking into the mirror you're looking at you're looking in the mirror when you're a sinner you're looking when you were born again you're looking when you as you grow you're looking you keep looking and as you look into the mirror you ever that phase is changing because you're becoming more and more like Jesus and you see your your own self dropping away and you see your own self fading away and you're becoming you're becoming you're becoming what the word expressed where the person that you used to be ain't there anymore you've been transformed by the word actually changing your life and brother Brandon will say miraculous and miraculous all the way along so you just keep deeper and deeper and deeper to a climax now you you think look at all these road maps that we have laid out for us in the Old Testament the road map of Abraham's life the three stages of Abraham's life and the three stages of David's life and and the journey that Ruth went on and the journey that David all these all these different ones went on and all of these came to a head when you could look at the life of Jesus that Jesus's life is a road map that we can compare our own life to three stages from baptism to complete death to self he was baptized on the River Jordan he went up on Mount Transfiguration and he died on the Garden of Gethsemane to himself and went up on the on the cross and gave up a complete death to himself where he said father forgive him for they don't they don't know what they do and you can look at look you can look at all these types and identify yourself with the same Journey the same thing that's going on and you know to think this afternoon that that's the purpose of this message that we've got something different than what the world offers we've got something different that you you go online and you listen to something that maybe Joel Osteen or Joseph Prince or any of the different ones that you know the preachers that get on the stage with their glass pulpits and so forth and I'm not knocking them or but you know we don't we've got something different than psychology and self-help we we've got something that they can't offer and what is that thing that we have that they can't offer what we've got is the mystery the complete mystery of redemption I'm talking about the the the the journey that I was just talking about that where you can look into the Bible and identify your own life with a journey that these Believers in the Old Testament and with the life of Jesus you think you think this morning the reason that we come to church sitting here the reason really is because we want to see unveiled in our own life the mystery of redemption the complete mystery of redemption and so many of you you know you're sitting here and you're listening you're hungry and you're you're you're hanging on every word because what you're you're wanting that culmination of our faith the revelation of the Seven Seals to be revealed in your life which reveals to you that reveals to you the full mystery of redemption oh to think now I I can go back into my own life and remember 20 years ago you know you come and you sit in church and you don't understand any things but I one thing I did understand was that brother Dale had understood what the Seven Seals were and you know sitting here this today maybe there's a lot of things that you struggle with and you you kind of battle with but I tell you one thing that we're all hungering for is the Seven Seals and that's one thing that this message has to offer that nobody else has to offer that God himself came down with a shout and the voice and the Trump of a mighty Angel yeah he came down just like Thessalonians said he came down to get to deliver to you the mystery of the seven seal book of redemption now when you can look into the book and see your own life to see yourself identify that you know then you know it's real God has given us everything we need for the journey if we'll just accept it now you go let's go back let's go back to the very foundation of the journey and brother Brown was preaching in the message to Intervale he said he said a few nights ago and that whole message he's preaching on this little girl in the hospital he said a few nights ago I was called to an emergency call of a young lady dying at the Clark County Memorial Hospital she was 19 or 20 years old and she had a four-month baby that has adults could read between between the lines and understands she had a four-month baby this little 19 or 20 years ago old girl and she said she made this statement to brother Ryan she said brother Brown I tell you said I still love the Lord Jesus but said I find it so hard to serve him now you think about a statement this morning now as brother brother Louise was preaching this morning about looking into the word and seeing seeing it what how we are and you know sometimes you look into the word and and you'll you'll keep maybe maybe this afternoon you look into the word and you don't get a good response back maybe you look into the word and you get a response back that shows that you ain't where you need to be and that's what the predicament of this little girl laying in this hospital bed 19 or 20 years old that's where she found herself that she was not where she needed to be but she ended up with this four month baby you know sometimes the devil will get you into a state where you look at your life and you say I wish I'd made other decisions I made I wish I'd gone down another road well now you find yourself in this situation oh that's what Grace is for Grace Grace can Grace can fix your problems with all the pro all the situation that you've got yourself into all the bad financial decisions that oh you just turn it over to God and if you're really yield yourself to God and not just some kind of a play thing but really turn yourself over to God oh you think all those times that people would come up in the prayer line and before they would be healed brother Brandon would ask him he said are you going to give your life to Jesus now that's what Jesus wants he's he wants to you to give your life to him if you'll give your life to him then then he'll give you everything that you have need of he promised he would be your provider if you'll give everything to him that he'll he'll bankrupt Heaven before he'll let any of his promises go the check bounce now now this little sister in the hospital saying I find it so hard to serve him I wonder this afternoon of course you know you don't have to raise your hand or anything you just just let the word echo in your heart is is that the situation that you find yourself in this afternoon that you find it hard to serve him because it's not supposed to be hard to be a Christian right right isn't that a perplexing thing to say there's hard things about being a Christian you'll go you'll go maybe to Walmart or somebody and people will laugh at you before because of the way that you dress or you'll go to school and your friends are bullying things like that that's not pleasant but now the cross has got padding on if you're back if you're filled with the Holy Ghost it's it's a padded cross the brother man would say in other words you're not supposed to be constantly going in and out and what is it it's the problem is our desire needs to be changed your if you're Desiring for the things of the world and you go to a camp meeting and and maybe you get you get a little fire in you and you start I'm really going to be a Christian now but then you go home and or maybe maybe some evangelist comes through even this church and you're sitting here listening to it and you get real enthused but then you go home and your desire is still the same and that desire keeps pulling you back to the things that you thought you would escape from see that's that's the struggle that should not be there that struggle shouldn't be there I believe this afternoon that we're preaching about a God that can change your desires to where where first you didn't want to come to church but now now a real born-again Christian is going to want a church which is why sometimes it's so you know you find preachers really preaching on coming to church because that is an identification that if you don't want the word if you don't want to be around Believers where is your desire if you'd rather be around grandma grandpa at home and and people that don't want to come to church and having birthday parties on Sunday and things well what's your desire and I know they're Straight Talk this afternoon I know maybe that wounds you but like Luis was preaching on this morning maybe maybe we need to be wounded sometimes maybe maybe sometimes we need somebody to yell at us so that we'll get out of the road before the truck comes and hits us I'd Rather somebody to yell at me to get out of the road than than to go my whole life and find up like this little sister this little lady did on her bed in the hospital and wound up brother Brown said her soul come up and she began to realize at the end of The Journey the condition that she was in I'd rather realize it now wouldn't you and I wouldn't you now brother Brown said now that is what I find around most Christian lives the most people think about this the most people that can profess Christianity they seem to have such a hard struggling time to hold on now that's a statement isn't it most people most you think you'd say some people but he said most people most people oh I believe it's because of a lack of correct teaching of the Bible he said there's no such a thing as holding on he done the holding on now see if you're if you're struggling this afternoon if you're hanging on with your fingertips you're on the ledge and your fingertips are turning to White and you're just struggling to just hang on I don't want to go back into the cussing and I don't want to go back into looking at stuff I shouldn't and I don't want to and you're just struggling then you're something's wrong you're you're doing it wrong because God is calling us to a place of rest he's calling us into the holy of holies where you don't struggle anymore there's no more struggle to a Christian now now don't get me wrong like I said there's hard things that you must endure as being a Christian there's things that you go through in life people say in hurtful things to you and so forth and all on and on but the whole Christian principle is based on rest you're resting if you're a Christian you ain't struggling so if you're struggling this afternoon let it prick you in your heart that there's something wrong with you there's something wrong with your experience and you've got to make it right you've got to make it right if you want to be right when God because you can't struggle you can't struggle and be a Christian in Matthew chapter 11 he said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls rest until you rest rest unto a mind that the devil has been bombarded and telling you you ain't worth nothing and you're just not of value to society to your family or you get in the holy of holies and shut yourself off and you'll get rest then you'll get rest from all those darts to the devil's throwing at you because now you can have confidence and what the word says you have confidence in what the word says because God has given you Faith he's given you his faith oh there's something that you can battle the devil with you're equipped then when you've got his faith then you you can do battle you can you could you have something to withstand everything that the devil throws at you because you believe well to think about that promise my yoke is easy and my burden is light to think about a promise like that now that you the Yoke the Yoke of Christianity if you get yoked up with Christ all those burdens and things that you've been carrying and burned out the burdens of true what what what is burdensome the burdensome weight of trying to fulfill the law by yourself you're just trying to do everything yourself you're trying to do it by works trying to work something up well trying to trying to make it happen on your own in Isaiah chapter 55 verses 1 and 2 it says Ho everyone that thirsteth Come Ye to the waters and he that hath no money Come Ye by and eat come buy wine and milk without money and without price in other words you don't have to do anything for this promise you don't have to pay for it you don't have to do anything to satisfy God you don't have to do anything it's by faith only it's not by your Works wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfieth not why do you spend money for that which is not bread right and your labor for that which satisfies not why why are you trying to work something up parking diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in fatness so this afternoon we're not preaching a legalistic message a message where we have a bunch of rules that you've got to follow you've got to dress a certain way you've got to do all these certain things in order to be acceptable to God like that but I'm preaching this afternoon a message where God will put his own life in you yes and then that will change you and that will be acceptable to God it's not works first but it's Faith first faith and how do you get faith by grace the grace of God extended to you that would send you preachers the preaching of the word so that it will begin to convict you and begin to mold your heart and soften up your heart and change your heart and change you and change you and change you until finally it changes you as we walk out of here so we're not preaching an Armenian gospel an Armenian gospel is where you it's by works by the things that you do that you've got to do something I'm not accepted by God this afternoon because of my adherence to a strict set of rules I'm accepted by God how do you please God as we've been studied out in Hebrews 11 by Faith by faith I'm pleasing to God God looks at me to see whether I believe his word and if I believe his word that is acceptable to him it's so acceptable to him that that Abraham's Faith was counted for righteousness God look to Abraham's Faith encountered it for righteousness and won't he do the same thing for you tonight that it's not by your works but it's by your faith if you believe God believe the promise that he made then he'll look at that and count it for righteousness and he'll overlook your Works he'll overlook your problems in your life all the wrongdoing you've done and he'll Overlook it just like he overlooked Abraham's just like he looked over overlooked Ruth's past and rahab's passed and wiped it away with the Egyptians he'll Overlook it because he's looking at your face can't you see how simple it is to be a Christian you don't have to work nothing up you just believe what God had already done it all goes back to the cross the cross died on the cross so that he would he would accomplish in his death everything that was necessary for you to have Oneness with him if we'll just look at cry Christ is the one that did the work Christ is the one that's doing the work it's all in Christ that's what Paul could say in Galatians chapter 2 verse 20 I am crucified with Christ I'm dead to myself I'm dying to myself nevertheless I live how do I live fear not I but Christ liveth in me it's not me doing the works anymore it's not me trying to build something up it's not me trying to force something but it's the Life of Christ in me that lives and because I believe he's put his own faith in me he's put his own life in me that's why Paul could save the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I live by the faith of the Son of God that's why brother random can say when you're Justified you're believing and it will only work as long as you have faith and you're Sanctified and you're believing but it will only work as long as you have faith and you can lose you can go away and lose your sanctification you can lose your justification you can lose that state because it will only work as long as you believe but when God gives you his faith it is permanent it is a permanent gift it's God's faith in you and you can never lose his faith you can never go back because it will last as long as your faith will last and when God gives you his faith it's permanent it's nothing that you do or what you can do it's what God has done for you in Christ thank you hello this afternoon if you're struggling if you're struggling won't you just put everything on Christ if you're struggling with something if you're struggling like all those things that brother Louise listed out this morning we make our list Paul made his list Paul's known for his list he would list things out in Galatians like Galatians chapter five now the works of the flesh shall manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variants emulations wraths Strife seditions heresies endings murders drunkenness revelings and such like and the list goes on and on but if your thing is not on the list that you're struggling with oh you know what you're struggling with oh let these words echo in your heart and begin to convict you that there's there's an antidote for whatever that thing is that you're struggling with oh I seems like lately I've been hearing so many preachers preach on on people struggling with what the world is struggling all this LGBT stuff oh everybody seems to be struggling talking about that preaching about that listen listen there's no reason to wonder whether you're this or that or whether you're you God can change the desire to be from this he can make your desires be straightened up you can't make yourself stop having desires but God is able to change your desires God is able to take an evil corrupt desire for drunkenness or reveling or whatever it might be and he'll he can change your desire by the preaching of the Gospel somebody said that brother Brown says well I'll tell you I just quit this and I went to seeking God I just could see I see how it's worded I just quit that I'm gonna I'm gonna stop I'm gonna stop with my own accord what are they trying to do work Works work it up and you don't come to God by works I just quit this and I went to seeking God and brother man flipped it around on me said no you don't understand no man never sought God man don't seek God God seeks man in other words there is nothing that you can do about it there is nothing you can do about it in Romans chapter 3 verse 11 it says there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after God there is nobody in in their sinful condition that's going to be go running after God in a way that God can answer back and the Garden of Eden when Adam got in his fix he ran behind fig leaves and tried to cover himself up with a religious situation the brogram said Adam alt Heaven running through the garden hollering father father where are you but it was God going through the Garden of Eden saying Adam Adam Where Art Thou and Adam hiding that's the nature of man it's the nature of man in other words you didn't have nothing about you don't have nothing about coming to God there's it there's nothing that you did to draw yourself to God God drawed you to Jesus there's nothing that you can do there's nothing no works that you can do it's by faith there's nothing that you can do in yourself to be pleasing to God God oh when God called you if you look it back in your own personal experience God called you God called you in something beginning what was it a deep call into the deep it wasn't because the minister called you or Drew here it wasn't because somebody conked you upset the head in the parking lot that that didn't save you like that story that brother likes to tell of the deacon that went up to Billy Paul and said don't you need to be at the altar but that wouldn't have saved him because you can't push it and work it up it's God drawing you no man can come except the father drawing God called you and you responded God called you and what something began to stir I got to get to God something began to call and draw and whatever you did however you responded if you raised up your hands in the congregation or failed out of the altar or fell down at your knee beside the bed it was because not because you were trying to work something up because you were responding to a god a god call brother Brown said when man man when he fell from Grace his nature was changed and he run from God and hid from God and that's still his nature a man can never seek God while he's a sinner God has to seek man and he said if you only knew Center Fred that the people I've talked to that says I don't believe in God I have no time for it I once tried it there's no I never did even desire it and he said I God has given you the desire tonight he's preaching to a people that they're at the altar call if God has given you the desire tonight to become a Christian don't turn him away oh I think one of the greatest gifts that there could be is that before you even born again is that little tug on your heart I I need something there's something something lacking in my life that I need something and all if there's something tugging in your heart this afternoon drawing and pulling at you don't don't turn him down don't grieve that Holy Spirit away is that don't grieve that Holy hush away that's drawing and pulling at you that's a Desiring to have fellowship with you John chapter 6 verse 44 says no man can come unto me except the Father which I sent me drawing and I will raise him up at the last day and what what does jaw mean if you really look at the definition of that that word draw means to to just drag off it's metaphorical to to draw by inward power what is this the Holy Ghost speaking to you to to pull at you and to draw you to himself in other words we are totally dependent on God's initiative and reaching out to us now brother Louise the whole congregation is starting to fall asleep on me so y'all y'all helped pull yeah I'll tell you it's it's hard to preach on a congregation that don't look like they're interested so it's that's just Humanity you know I yeah I know it kind of bothers y'all when ministers kind of horrible it seems like we're harping on that yeah wake up and everything but it is that's my Humanity it's hard it's hard to preach somebody with their eyes Go in different directions and when I open when I close and and they're leading up over on their shoulder and one eye on the wall the head on the wall so we all maybe that's just something I got to overcome but if it is y'all just pray for me we've all got things we've got to overcome ourselves but uh it sure is easier to preach when you don't feel like you're swimming Upstream that's what I'll say here brother Raymond the seven Church ages he said my brother the other night receiving Christ he said don't ever push me Bill said when God speaks to me I said you can't come until he calls you oh God is good enough to knock at your heart tonight and would you be foul enough to refuse it refuse him he said think of it that every person that comes on the invitation of the Lord Jesus Christ is Promised eternal life and the resurrection in the last day every person that comes on that invitation has a promise that you can lay claim to that if you come if he gives you that invitation it's a promise that you'll have eternal life so now if if God is calling you we're not we're not going to keep you away from responding oh if you try to just work it up and try to push it forward and say well I'm just gonna I'm gonna pray or I'm gonna go to church and I'm just going to try to make it work that won't work but if you respond to a call of God in your heart it's going to work or if you can feel something Supernatural churning in you like brother Brown when he was preaching look into the Unseen he said don't you feel that pulsating in your soul something pulsating in you something pulling at you something that's that's the call of God in your life and if God is calling come to the altar if God is called and lift up your hands if God is calling open up your heart if God is calling kneel in prayer nobody's going to stand in your way when brother Brown when brother round was preaching the Oneness of unity in in Waterloo Iowa I I saw a somebody was testifying about this on Facebook it was actually um you know Esther married Micah and it was his mom testifying about this on Facebook that she said when he when brother round walked up from the from the back of the building he got to her uncle and he put on his hand on his shoulder and said the only thing wrong with you is you don't pray enough find yourself a closet somewhere now to think now that that that might be a lot of our problems sitting here tonight that we just might not pray enough to you know even after you're born again God continues to he can certainly more that after you're born again he keeps drawing and pulling at you and maybe maybe this afternoon maybe you've put off praying and reading your Bible a long time but if you just get along with God maybe maybe this will stir you up to just really get along with God he even said you might eat too much you might drink too much you might laugh too much you might walk too much but you'll never pray too much why why why do you need to pray not need to pray like works like working something up but you need to pray to have fellowship with God so to get your mind in line with God and seal yourself off from the world and begin to think about what God's word says and commune with him what kind of a Christian would we be if we just neglect a communion with God we neglected getting along with God and just fellowshipping with him one-on-one and getting getting a little bit of Praise getting a little bit of time where we can can lift up our hands and worship just alone alone in the shower alone in the car with God letting the tears run down our face do you see you see why prayer is so important to a Christian not something to work up now not something to put before your faith and say well if you pray then you can be a Christian no if you'll respond to the god call of God in your life and then start praying then everything will work out all right but don't neglect praying now now why because God God is calling you into fellowship with him he's calling you into a private life with him he's calling you what to an overcoming life a life where you don't have to struggle and you see what you do in prayer is you get you you get in struggles of life and and and and trials of life and people say hurtful things about you and things happen at work the stresses of life and you get in prayer and you just what do you do and you're just dumping it all on God and you're having a good talk with your daddy having a good talk with your daddy like Billy Paul walked up on his daddy praying in his prayer closet and he said he said he could hear him in there he's crying out the papa God Papa God because he had a relationship with him and what was he doing he was having a fellowship with him in his prayer closet Fellowship fellowship and women communion with God and brother Adam would say I find that people so struggle seems like I meet people and they say it's such a struggle and probably there's many sitting right before me now that has the ups and downs the ins and outs this day they're all right you meet them and well they love the Lord today and tomorrow they're having such a struggle to hold on the devil is so tempted them and they're having such ups and downs then you meet somebody that's on the hilltop all the time now you think about that let's think about this for a second now brother there's nothing bothers them at all now you think about that that statement now I can't help it I can't help with that brother said you can come to a place where you don't struggle anymore now think about that if you're in a struggle this afternoon if you're struggling with your desires and your desires is pulling you maybe maybe you're sitting here right in church right now thinking I wish I could go home so I could go watch some YouTube videos I wish I could go home so I could cook something on the stove I wish I could go home because your desire is not here right here listening to the word of God and where wherever your heart is that's where your Treasures are going to be laid up that's that's now if the word of God is a real treasure to you that's what your heart is that's that's what you desire now I want to think about this that in Ephesians chapter one he said according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love that that's what God is calling us to he's calling us to a place of Holiness and to be without blame to think now look at look at your journey look at the journey that God's taken us through full Redemption of your soul and your spirit and your body that your soul can be without blame and holy that your spirit can be so lined up with God that brother Adam said it's like a solar system that the sun is at the middle your soul is at the middle and your senses are in Perfect Harmony around that thing on the center just like the solar system is that your whole being can be in such harmony with the word of God until the devil don't know what to do with you that he can throw something at you and you your desire is so much for the word and you're so walking in the word now now you this I know that we struggle with this we struggle with this in our mental faculty to think that God wants us to come to a place of such complete rest until there is no more struggle left now now some of you if you look back in your life some of you struggle with drugs some of you struggle with drugs and taking drugs and it might have been some bad drugs or it might have been some some of the weak drugs but you still struggle with drugs nonetheless but you don't struggle with that no more do you because God took the struggle away he took it away and you're not struggling with that anymore now that's what that's the kind that's an example of the kind of rest that God wants God is changing your life he can change you some of you might have struggled with cigarettes but not anymore you might have struggled with this or that but not anymore some of you some of you might have even struggled with coming to church some of you might have struggled some of you might have still come struggled with coming to church but if you used to struggle with church and now you're in church you don't struggle with that anymore amen amen oh when you when when something really gets a hold of you in your heart and your desire changed and you want to be around the people of God it's not a struggle to come to church it's not a struggle if you're struggling to come to church then you're working and you're working you're not wrestling if you're struggling to put away that cigarette if you're struggling to walk down the aisle in the grocery store without going by the wine or the liquor hour then you're working you're not resting you're not working you are but but a Christian is a real Christian is not working they are resting that's what after all that work that that that Ruth went through she she was she was going behind all the men that worked for Boaz picking up bending over at the back and probably had uh back trouble after the end of the day picking up all that working working working picking up the little gleaning gleaning the sheaves working working working but finally she found a place at boaz's feet and when she got it boaz's feet and he threw over her the covering then the her work ceased and what was she doing she was sitting there on the threshing floor watching Boaz get up the next morning and who went to work Boaz went to work Boaz went to work and Ruth stopped working because Ruth is at risk now that's a type of you and I we're not supposed to be working we're not supposed to be struggling in and out go to a camp meeting get real fire on fire come back to church and get real lackadaisical can't even hardly keep our eyes open during service don't really don't really want to be there and get something we can check off our check box oh but if your desire has changed you want to be oh if your desire is right then your worship will change your attitude will change your praise will change if your desire is right then you've got something to praise God about because and I think I think we've all got something that we can praise about God about to know that we're resting that we're not working that God wants us to rest that it's not us that is Christ doing it and Hebrews chapter 4 Paul says so then there remains of Sabbath rest for the people of God for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his you have rested from your works from struggling and trying to make it work and trying to force something if you're struggling this afternoon something is not right if you're struggling something ain't right now brother Brown will give an example of like a pipe that you know you uh if you've ever had water problems where you know those of us with a lot of women in the house the pipe gets all clogged with a lot of hair and you got to get it unstopped and if the pipe is clogged up it just won't work what what's happening to water is struggling to get water from one place to the other and that's the same thing with a lot of us in in our spiritual experience our flus get clogged up and we're struggling to get to get access to God and struggling and trying to work something up and and the and the pipe just think it's clogged up but God can remove the stroke in other words he can remove the clog the partial clog or the floor clog and open it up so that the Holy Spirit can run freely in your life now isn't that what we all want this afternoon that's what we come to church he said and questions and answers she said like I said to a person it's like an old stop took pipe and you run a little wire through it and you get a hold of this wire and you Zig Zig Zig and there's a great flow of water trying to get through Zig Zig Zig you can't get it but you know there's something up there you can feel it it's up on that end then after a while here give her a great big pull and he imitates the sound of Russian water goes through the pipe that's the way it is then the water just keeps on coming that's the way the holy spirit is sin stopped up the pipes you sit back and say I'm timing you know I couldn't say that I'm afraid that people think I was a Holy Roller see now when you feel that little tugging of the spirit that's God drawing you that's the father no man can come except the father draw him you feel that little tugging of the spirit you want it more than life it more than you want more than your own life it means more to you I got to have it or Die the first thing you know you get a hole or something like putting that little pot you get a hold of it you think that's it Lord you pull the cork out here she comes gone oh my free I don't care if the President Eisenhower was sitting there you say glory to God now you think about that that description there is the kind of Liberty and kind of freedom and worship kind of freedom and Christian life that God wants us to have he don't want to struggle to try to pump something up in the church service he don't want us to struggle and try to live a Christian Life he wants the Holy Spirit to have such preeminence in our life until it's just gushing it's just flowing everywhere isn't that what the statue of a perfect man is supposed to symbolize it that water just gushing out of the top floor what's he doing pushing out all the weeds and all all the trash and everything just flowing in you freely cause why cause you got a hold of something oh you gotta you answered that tug that's drawn at your heart and you responded to it when God began to began to call at your heart there's something in you that begin to respond so let's get up let's get up to the hilltop wherever that Hilltop is in your journey right now let's get up to the top of that Hilltop where it doesn't bother us anymore and why Christ speak he said I'm so glad that a man's can so completely serve god Till the devil don't know what to do just obey God so completely to the devil say oh my get away I don't want to hear it no more that's right and he said you can do it so completely yes you can do it you think this afternoon see that's what preachers are challenging that idea that you can't do it I can't do it but you can do it and God has given us the recipe to do it to have to have our body our spirit and our soul so completely in line with God until we're caressed and resting completely in the Redemptive promise and the deity of Jesus Christ he says now friends I know this to be the truth I know people don't realize who you are every person in here can live above sin can live without sin live in God you'll make mistakes but the blood of Christ will forgive you it's by his grace what is this I'm talking about it's a promise of Grace I'm talking about measures of Grace overcoming Grace to each one that I'm looking out at a congregation a lot of different people you all look different some have glasses on some have don't have glasses some young or olds different colors different backgrounds but this promise it is not a respecter of persons whoever whosoever will let him come This Promise This Promise of this kind of Grace that you can live and overcoming life is to you no matter what your background is brother I'm going to say in Grace God has given to us all freely as we have need everything that we have need of he said God doesn't respect persons he wants all of his children to have the same a righteous father wouldn't give up one a dish of ice cream without giving them all ice cream now you think you think about what that means if you could look around the building this morning and see some living like that like what he quoted earlier in this message some living without a struggle that means you can live without a struggle too oh if oh if you could really grasp that I that's a promise to run after if you congrat if somebody's getting a blessing then you can get a blessing too if somebody's receiving healing in their body then you can receive it too Grace that's God's Gift of grace to you that he's not going to give it just to one without giving that same opportunity to everybody God God is not a respecter of persons brother I will say did you know that that little cherry tree or a little apple tree when you set it out when it's no bigger than about one half inch tall that every bushel of apples that you'll ever collect off that tree is in it right then the only thing that that little tree does you just set it out and water it and it has to drink and drink until it gets so much it just goes to pushing up drinks more than a slotted portion and it swells out and it pushes out limbs it pushes out buds it just keeps drinking drink and drink until it just pushes out and that's what the Christian does it's all drinking resting peace it's not what you struggle and strive and pull at you defeat the very purpose that you're representing when you do that when you struggle and strive it's just rest oh to think that you can be like that tree that David talked about a tree planted by the rivers and water that all you do is just guzzle up as much water as you can and the more water you can guzzle up the more you push out and push out until you're pushing out fruit until you're pushing out a life that everybody can see on display and that's what a real Christian does now it don't matter it doesn't matter what kind of background you got it doesn't matter if you're a minister it doesn't matter if you're a house by housewife God is no respecter of persons that Grace is for all God's not one you have to beg and cry and plead and fast and starve and everything like that to get you I thank God it's not by all works to think that if it was by works that we'd have to get our little Rosary board out or something all the little beads out and tick through them and and do something until until the like a priest was satisfied what if it was by prayer what if it was by fasting and you had to fast a certain amount of times or a certain number of hours every week to be acceptable to God but God's not he's saying God ain't like that he's not one you've got to beg and cry and plead and fast and starve and everything like that to get to Now flip it around that don't mean we don't believe in praying and fasting we just don't believe in doing it from the work single but we believe by faith by faith you you pray and you fast and you do things because God is drawing you if God calls you to fast then fast if God many times God will call will call a minister to fast many many of us ministers know about you know you just suddenly you just lose your appetite and you're just I'm just not going to eat and it's not because you're hungry it's not because you're trying to work something up it's just because you're you're you you're preparing a sermon and God just calls you to fast in that moment if God calls you to pray pray if God is pulling at your heart to pray pray but you're not praying because you're trying to work something up you're praying because you want to enter into communion with God and God is drawing you God is pulling you God will call you to it you don't call yourself God will call you you don't do things by work it's by Grace but if God calls you you better go oh listen now if God is calling you to pray to a better a greater prayer life then you better pray if God is calling you to fast then you better fast you better respond if God is calling you to give up your life to give your life to him and so that he can take take feel you and and use you and do something with your life you'd better respond because if you don't what happens you're you're so he said your soul begins to draw just kind of pull back and it's that that thing that God gave you Desiring something thirsting for something begins to draw back you're grieving away the Holy Spirit your soul begins to drop down until you want you won't realize the state you're in until you're on your deathbed like this little sister that he was preaching about this little young lady when they're on her deathbed her soul come up and she realized that she was lost laughs if God is calling to your you to respond respond is God calling you to an overcoming life now you think about those old Egyptian task Masters had drove the people to do things that they were burdened to do and after they look back in the Red Sea they found them every one around there you think you know a man never knows what it is to live a Victorious life until he's completely overcome when you realize that you look back and you ain't struggling anymore that's why that's why Miriam when they got over on the other side she could take up that tambourine and sing a new song Praise after the battle she began to praise that's why after the walls fell down that Rahab on the wall with that sinful background she looked to God's promise and she after the walls came down she married into the into Judah and what's what's the banner of Judah the banner of Judah is praise oh she got her praise on then when she began to realize what God had done she married into the house of Praise when she saw the walls coming down all her past was erased all her sin was gone that's when you realize that you've truly overcome and Christ has equipped you to overcome and let me ask you let's just stop a little bit I'm trying to teach this afternoon and not preach so much what what are you what are you really overcoming like brother Louise was preaching on this morning you're overcoming yourself yeah yeah and I see that's what we we get called up so many times as like brother Louise was I'm riffing on brother Louise this morning off of that sermon that he was we so many times we get caught up in what other people are doing you know I I was sitting we went out to eat with um uh I'm gonna say the brother's name we don't have to eat with brother Marcus Becker a while back and one thing he really said just kind of stuck with me he said if you can if you can understand yourself it's about understanding yourself it's not about understanding other people because you're trying to overcome yourself so that's what we're trying to when we come to church and we look into the mirror of God's word we're trying to over understand our problems and and that's that's what the devil does he'll put a veil over your eye where you don't even realize your own problems exactly what brother Louise was saying this morning that when you if you're a cheater or or a liar or you know all the things that we could list out the devil will cover your eyes over so you don't even realize that you're prideful that you've got enmity and but the word The Goth that's what the gospel does is it it takes that takes that Veil away from your eyes just like the grease that brother Ram's Mama used to put over his eyes so that he could see in the morning it takes the it opens up your eyes so that you can really see your what what we really see need to see is that the biggest enemy that we have is ourselves it's not the person sitting next to us on the Pew it's not the minister behind the pulpit uh the biggest enemy we have is ourself and Christ has equipped us to overcome ourselves to overcome what your reasoning and your pride and your temper and your impatience and your lust and all those things that Paul might have listed out in the Bible okay that's why in Revelation 11 15 when the seventh trumpet sounded there were great voices in heaven that said the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of Our Lord so that's what that's what the gospel is doing that's what God is doing is he's taken all these little kingdoms that we have in our life of our pride and our temper and all these things and he's tearing them down until he takes over what's he's taking things over yes it's a takeover it's a gospel takeover that God has taken over your life until there's nothing left but like you read in the Book of Revelation where it says it says the books were opened and the Deeds were read and they were judged the the foolish virgin and all the ones the Sinners that came to the throne and they're judged by the deeds in their life but you that that's written in the name in the Lamb's Book of Life there's nothing written about you but your name your name there's no Deeds there's no Deeds because these have been wiped away there's nothing left but you can identify Yourself by you looking there and the book is open and there's a name Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and so forth and so on and you your name's written down but no Deeds only your names are written down because your your life has been taken over by God I want to think that one day all this sinful life will be completely left behind it will be completely overcome you know that the very first miracle that Jesus ever did was a testament to that when he went and ended that marriage of Cana and he he he he uh changed the water into wine brother Brown said he proved in his first miracle turning water to wine and so forth showing he bypassed the vine he just spoke from Water to Wine God just spoke it and bypassed all that it would have went from wine up through the grapevine and then ferment and ferment and a vat and turned into wine but God just spoke it and bypassed all that so will he in the resurrection of all the sexuals and marriage and things it'll all be done away with God will just speak and will live again God will just speak speak what you'll hear the word and your body will be changed oh to think that your body won't have to be born again you won't have to take this body and put it back through through an incubation put it back through come forth from a natural birth but God will just take it skip all that process skip it and just change your body Hallelujah I'm trying to get to this little story he's talking about this little woman that was laying there in the hospital and I'm going to be closing here in just a minute he said there was a woman who belonged to a very prominent denominational Church to live close we always doubted her experience so if brother Branham doubted somebody's experience I'll take that as a right when I look and see people not coming to church and not living right I doubt their experience he said we always doubted her experience I'm sorry but that's just the way it is you you look and see people that that they're Desiring right they're not living right and brother Randall said and we're you're not doing it out of a place of judgment but you're doing a place of concern people are concerned we're concerned about one another he said she just reasoned that she was right she moved to a new church and noticed the neighbor girls wearing disgraceful clothes and she said the other girls do it so can I the other girls do it he said her faith and God was intellectual it was reasoning your mind will reason but your heart don't reason he said the very soul that was telling her it was wrong it was she was grieving it away because she kept saying they smoked cigarettes so why can't why can't she smoke see that's out the devil the Trap Of The Devil you start looking at other people you start looking at the world young people you start looking at your friends and you start getting off the path because you start thinking your mom and daddy don't know they don't know what they're talking about and I what it is that the devil will put on you a spirit where you just want to be popular and you want to be accepted oh but ought to get in God and then you can have rest and be accepted be a part of be part of uh able to live a holy clean life what a blessing to be able to live a clean life where you're not burdened down by all the things that a devil the devil will put on you and he said a little Slicker moved in the neighborhood with his hair slicked down and every night before they go to bed she'd slip out to take the things out the backyard and he'd kiss her good night across the fence and the first thing you know she left John her husband and married this guy the very soul that was telling her it was wrong she was grieving it away oh see when your soul was echoed something down on the inside I shouldn't do this oh that's that's what I was talking about this morning listen listen to that little still small voice listen to that little sometimes you know sometimes it's a real quiet voice I'll tell you I'll tell you a good example we went we went to the church there in South Carolina and I went out in the parking lot to get something out of the car and uh and I I was going to reach for the door handle and I just felt impressed if you touched that door handle the alarm is going to go off and I thought that's strange I'm gonna do it anyway and I opened the door Now isn't that how the same thing in the spiritual now if you if if you just listen to that voice it'll get you out of trouble that little boy says telling you you better not do that you're going to get in trouble now I got myself in trouble because I didn't have the keys my wife had the key the key fob so I was standing out there and that thing was hop on I had to go run back in church worry about you know ever what everybody would say me going back in and out and getting the key from my wife if you listen to that little voice then it'll save you a lot of trouble just listen to that little impression you you need to apologize to that brother you shouldn't have done that don't go there your friend will invite you to go to some some sleepover at their house or something like that and you you've got that little tub or maybe the parents you gotta look you better you better be careful about that better not do that you better listen to those little things like that pay heed to it that's one thing I've learned as as the years go by a lot of times you know you don't quite have confidence in that voice like maybe that's just me but as the years go by you had more and more confidence in that still Small Voice that you need to take heed to it I wish I would have listened to it before I opened that door and he said when you say oh he says smoking cigarettes and drinking and carousing and running around is the very symptoms of seeing it's the attributes of your unbelief and you do those things because you don't believe Jesus it all goes back to Faith the reason that you don't there is the reason that you do those things is because you you don't believe when you say you're a Believer and do do that it shows there's something wrong you don't believe you're making out like you believe oh you see why the fruits show what's really there yes when you when you don't you know the saying uh if it walks like a duck and acts like a duck it's a duck well if it looks like a Christian if it looks like an antichristian thank you brother he said you're talking taking reasonings and not taking your Soul's conviction because your soul is the part of God that's in you that'll agree with God's word being true if not you'll just take our intellectual Now isn't that you it's going to take more more than intellectual I was like looking online I showed you all those artificial intelligence drawings that in my Sunday school lesson this morning artificial intelligence is getting it's it's really taken off if you're not paying attention to the news and recently there was the first very first artificially intelligent AI generated church service my point is it's going to take more than intellectual and if you go out to one of these AI tools online you can ask it a question and it will spit back a very good biblically sound answer I I mean like like you're talking to somebody that knows what they're talking about with scriptural references and tying things together in the Bible and it'll spit back as many paragraphs as you want and it's it's very Advanced now what they've done over there in England they had a a church service where they used this to to just generate a church service and then they had a artificial intelligence like a a a a fake person up on the screen delivering a sermon and all those people were listening to a sermon delivered by a computer now you see that's why it's going to take more than intellectual it's good it's got to take it's got to take the spirit it's The Spirit Well they what they said when they were listening to that they said it was lacking hard it was lacking some kind of something real because it was spitting out just reams of text but there was something lacking it's it's got to take it's got to take something more than intellectual to make this message live it's got to be lived it's got to be it's got to be a life on display where it's walking and talking and God God is using your life and using your lips and using your feet using your your body not something that you can just read off of the page and say how much you know and brother Brown will say of course see see this that's what this woman's problem was she was looking at it from an intellectual perspective thinking well I I like the Bible uh and and the Devils was the devil in the old in the New Testament said they they they uh you know knew who Jesus was and they uh said Thou Art the Son of God and all those kind of things it's got to be more than just intellectual brother Adam said of course with that little Slicker she ought to have had brains enough to know if he would run away from one right one Rife one wife he would do another one so that's what he done she'd say I belong to church my letter is in the church I'm just as good as anybody I said I'm as good as you are your soul will always testify to the word of God if it's born again she thought she was right now see what the I know y'all getting tired y'all hang on with me just a little bit I'm battling it out but I got a message delivering so hang with me just a few more minutes that's what the devil will do is he'll he'll he'll make you think that you're right when you're not right that's the trick of the devil to cloak you over and make you think you're right when you're not and brothers will say he said you say well I know I believe I'm right you think you're right because of an intellectual understanding where you just look at you you like being at church you like but there's something you're still struggling there's not supposed to be any struggle I I was really I was looking at that quote of Muhammad Ali where he said I don't always know what I'm talking about but I know I'm right now what a strange thing for somebody to say I don't always know what I'm talking about but I know I'm right and that's the trick that the the Trap that the devil puts on people to say I I don't know what I'm talking about but I know I'm right what a strange thing for somebody to say I don't know what I'm talking about but I know I'm right but it doesn't make sense but that's how that's how you'll see people that are trapped in sin I don't know how to get out I don't know I don't know but I don't know but I know I'm right I I know I'm right brother and would say today people say oh that was in the day pass he said the first thing you know your soul will go away from you will become so culturized out there with the rest of the Cults and things T you'll think you're right till you think you're right until death stares you in the face and it'll be a different picture but when your experience agrees with this Bible and says every word is true I wonder this afternoon as we're as we're closing in just a moment can you can you identify your experience with the Wilderness Journey can you identify your experience with with the all these things that we're talking about Street three stages of the journey going through justification and sanctification and
