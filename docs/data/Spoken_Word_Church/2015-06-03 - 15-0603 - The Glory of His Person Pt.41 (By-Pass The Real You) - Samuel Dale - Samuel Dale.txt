planning on having questions and answers now if you have some and you have them written down let me have them if you will and I can think on it and study on a little bit by the weekend but I remembered that and I went back and listened to the both Services Sunday to you know get kind of lined up and I remembered I had said that I would try to cover a part there on this that U I hadn't covered so I thought I'll do it tonight and then we'll have uh maybe at least Sunday afternoon we'll have questions and answers all right so you get your questions and answers and sorry if you would come ton not thinking you're going to do it but write them down and we'll try to cover them even if you're not here we'll try to read and cover that but remember the bible study this coming Saturday 6:00 remember the Father's Day weekend I make these announcements because only internet sometimes they cut it and pull in you know and the whole entire song service is not actually covered under someone that you hear and see so you know it is if you're doing it live but other than that you know you're trying to to do and I I make announcements to make sure we don't forget okay so the the Father's Day weekend will be June 18th 19th 20th and just make your plans to be that the ladies during that time on June the 19th we'll be having a painting time here at the church and I'm I'm freely I'll buy all the paint they want as long as they don't mess up everything else you know and they can just paint and I don't think that's the kind of painting they're talking about but anyhow all right they're having that and remember that and remember the 4th of July meeting with brother Vernon being with us and the cookout and then remember the fellowship meeting will be here now on July the 18th the third Saturday in July all right remember those announcements so we're making them a way ahead of time okay Revelations 1 and 2 Corinthians 5 Heavenly Father we thank you for all the things that you've given unto us we thank you for loving us because we know you loved us way before we could ever think about loving you and Lord it takes time sometimes to learn to love and to make it into a full complete manifestation and we desire Lord to know your love and your understanding of each one of us have your way forgive our sins lead us by thy Grace remember the ones that are not here the ones that are traveling the ones that things that are doing and just remember each one and let your grace be with each one of us we love you in Jesus name amen remember Anna Roberts now we'll be having a surgery in the morning so remember that pray the Lord would would uh you know take care of everything I tried to fix these little things up here to see if we could stop the fluffing fluffing but if it works we'll put some tape on it and do something all right uh Revelations 1:12 and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PS with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brce as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters all right we'll go to Second corini 5 for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were disolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens now this is not talking about a house all right it's a body but it's not a house that way all right so when we get on through you'll see for in this this house that we're living now we Gran earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our H our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we shall be be not be shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do grown being burdened not for that we should be un clothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath wrought us for the selfs same thing is God who also hath given us the earnest of the spirit therefore now concluding it what we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in this body we are absent from the Lord you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to to the reading of the word now I want to try to just make a fast run through uh some parts that I want to make sure that you follow me and then we'll get to the part of where we talk about bypassing and and things like that so remember that uh let's see seem like there other announcements but not but I'm now everybody is supposed to have a copy of tonight's notes so if you don't have one raise your hand they'll give you a copy of it to where that you can can uh keep these I like to give you these because see sometimes we even though we quote so many things so many times still it's better to have them laying somewhere that you can pick it up and read it and and know you know what is being said now backing up a little bit onto this past Sunday services that we were trying to cover and have been trying to cover for a long time um 40 something years of how real that God really is now I know that may get old to you it may be burdensome to hear the same thing over and over and over but Paul said it was needful uh so I don't worry about it you know I I I worry if it does burden you because why would not you want want to know more about uh your savior your lord your all and all and to know that he's real because you got to admit now that there was a time when we all started basically that started out in organized religion and and all and that we started out believing well God is a spirit you know he just a spirit he just just floating around and and in all things and when the prophet begin to speak of him as he did and how real he was then you know it begin to D on me that hey wait a minute we've been missing a lot you say well brother God is a spirit is that all that we have is that all the thoughts that we can consider about the great Eternal Everlasting in God that he's just a spirit now I agree with that I believe in it I believe he's a spirit all right we know that we understand that but my point is that we lock down on that a lot of times and we don't try to go on to get an understanding and uh you know and that to me I believe that's why God had to send us a prophet cuz we were already reading the scripture that says God is a spirit amen but you know we we we did you know and I wonder today still how many people still just think about God as a spirit that there's no form to him he's just you know he's just well what do you mean he's just everwhere but brother Brandon said he wasn't just everywhere amen we'll read that in a minute he's a being he's not like the wind right and see that's what I've tried to get get you to to think on and and and get you to consider the fact of how come we believe Hebrews 13:8 that it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever do you believe that just because brother brandham said it now let me go on further do you believe that just because the Bible said it or have you had a personal experience with him as your your lord and savior to where that you know he's the same amen that's why I went through all of that doings of trying to talk about that every person's ever born again is born again the same same way just like every baby is born naturally normal babies are born the same way all right and see then following that we can see that whatever he was he still is amen and whatever he will be he's already that right right he may not have made it manifest that's a whole lot different but it's to talking about well well brother Dale I just can't see that because I I just can't see uh the way you think that God is real you know well what do you think you mean as I keep saying to you you I mean he created us but he's not more real than we are right yeah but but he's real in his own way what kind of way what is it you know see that's where I've been trying to just lay that down to where to let us think about it and I keep saying it that God never gained any attributes right after coming into the world right if you did he changed something went wrong and he said I'm God and I Chang not all right see then it can't be something that has changed it can be more understanding of he that has already been but not something to change to another way or something that's just words that's terminologies that's a way of God doing things to contact the human mind all right and the one thing that I wanted to make sure that you followed me you know at least whether you believe it or not that's up to you because I can't reveal it and there's no need of me trying to uh but to me see I know our thoughts used to link even after we were coming into the message and we we we would link it together as there was just this you know self-existing this great Eternal and we just know nothing about him is that the way you thought we know nothing about him because he's just a great Eternal he's just like the wind just blowing he's a spirit he's just doing is that as far as we can go by trying to understand about the eternal that's why I tried to make that statement Sunday enough to where we would understand that we think and I know I did that's the way I thought I thought you you you just see nothings there nothing you know and then all at once something comes into being that's created and as it comes into being you know then I can start thinking about uh the word the logos the speech to you know the great theophany because we'd learned those words and we thought we knew what we were talking about right and then we would bring that down toward human flesh and we would try to even make the reality of Christ the flesh the body of Jesus to be more real than just be a spiritual form well I I don't I don't get that see I mean if I'm wrong on what I see in the godhead I've at least told you it's not something oh I've got this great Revelation but I just can't explain it to you well shut up blabbering because all you're doing is confusing people you ever seen people do that I got it right here I got it right here but I can't explain it well throw that out the door you can't explain it at least enough to be able to comprehend a little bit you know I can't explain that a a brown cow eats green Grace and gives white milk and you Churn it and it turns into yellow butter I can't explain that but I know it happens and I'm not going to stop drinking the milk or eating the butter amen so why can't we do that on understanding God and see if you've seen what I was trying to bring Sunday the he was more real back there than what we can see him as being real now amen or else where is your god what is your thinking remember he condescended for us to understand condescending means to come down in forms to where we can comprehend but see we had it as going from nothing upward to try to get us to understand no no brother de BL that's that's the best way for me to say it but you see I believe he's real and when that Prophet began to talk about God as he saw him I believe he's real I don't believe he's just a myth Oles right I don't believe it's a Doctrine and an idea is that all this message is you know some different way of explaining things a better way of explaining it maybe is it that or is it the revealing of the Eternal God see then what do you think about it when you go back to say well he was just self-existing he existed alone all right I believe that but you know when he existed alone in our terminologies we're really confused because he existed alone but within him he had all the attributes he was a Healer he was a savior right right he just hadn't displayed it that's right well now may I say it this way for you to think about it at the same time he was a Healer and a savior you know what that would make him then make him Father Son and Holy Ghost right the trunity of God not the Trinity of God the triun of God are you going to make him pick up those things on the way down you know in you're condescending see the way I see condescending it means there something a whole lot more greater and as it begins to come down I can begin to comprehend it and then when it gets to hear in the New Birth we start going back the other way of of understanding the things of God and that's why it takes the new birth see we can't understand it just by head knowledge and quotes and ideas it is just another concept or a thought or a Doctrine if there's not a personal experience involved and see that's what I mean when I say and read what brother Brown said he said when you can't be saved he said without a revelation you can't be saved without faith amen what is the new birth brother Brandon he said the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen that's right he doesn't reveal himself in a group Theology of a group therapy right you know this is not a group therapy we're individuals everybody in the in the body of Christ is an individual it's not to just say well so and so believes it so I believe it we better get away from the day Grandma believed it come on we're not against grandma she was wonderful and done what she' done but you know grandma taught you a Trinity right Grandma taught you hell was eternal yeah grandma taught you a lot of things that ain't in the Bible I don't love if you throw off on my grandma like that I'm talking about mine so you forget yours okay but see if we don't see him as to be real what do we see God is to be you know what's our ideas what's our thoughts I gave you these word that I've had these you know I've used them a lot in the message coming down but let's just read some and we'll read pretty fast because you got the the the ability to read with me and and let's let's go ahead and start number one brothers and uh it's from the message it wasn't so from the beginning preach 1960 and watch what he said now God is omnipotent omnipresent by being omniscient see now he's omnipotent he's omnipresent but we know he's not omnipresent outside of the point of being omnipotent right because he's not omnipresent because he's a being and a being is not an omnipresent all over the world all right you remember that makes him Omni president he being omniscient makes him om depress he knows all things but God could not be just like the Aras because God has a dwelling place right man God is not a myth God is a being God Jesus he God pronoun he is a being therefore he's omniscient omnipresent omnipotent and infinite but he's got a Dwelling Place amen have you ever thought about back before this world come into existence where did God dwell well he was just just um he was just floating like well see if you do it that way you you ain't got to make no place but now if you're going to believe God is a being and not like the wind you're going to have to start someday believing that he just didn't become tangible as the journey come along but that he was tangible before the journey started well where was he at what okay we'll let your Prophet answer it cuz he just answered it right there he says God has a Dwelling Place well now brother what he means is God has a dwelling place now well now you're interpreting so go ahead look at the next one who is this MDC and look what he says drop on down safe time we'll get back to these later paragraph 49 and if he isn't infinite he isn't God God has to be infinite we are we are finite he is infinite and he was omnipresent omnicient and omnipotent if he isn't then he can't be God knows all things all places because of his omnipresent omnicient makes him an omnipresent he is a being he's not like the wind he is a being he dwells in a house but being omniscient knowing all things makes him omnipresent because he know everything that's going on but he's a being he dwells in a house well brother that work with that house well let's use the term that we'll use later on in the message that the prophet us it let's just call it Heaven that's right okay to just get it away from trying to make whatever you want to try to do let's just call it Heaven because you're going to find out in a minute that's what your Prophet says all right he's got a Dwelling Place he dwelt in a dwelling place before this world ever begun am now you better remember one thing that before this world according to your Prophet what did he say was the first creation Angels right right am I right now he said Angels is his first creation well now Angels were created before the world ever created so where were they and where were they doing what were they doing I'm talking about back before this world ever begun I know that requires thinking and it mean a point A lot of times too that a lot of people's never heard it that way because it just go along with the ideas and concept but where's your ideas and concept with the Bible and the message right for 40 something years that's been my ideas and concept if he made Angels before he made the world then where did they stay where were they do you follow look at the next one number three which is actually called fellowship e19 and he's while they bringing it up he said he was talking to somebody and he told the person he said uh I said God is a being now God's just not like you're like the Arab if he would you would never have to seek the Holy Ghost it would be in you because he'd fill all space and things God's omnipresent sure by being omniscient knowing all things but God has a dwelling place because he is a being right exactly right and God dwells with fellowship with us now under the shed blood of Jesus Christ I didn't give them these because I I don't give you everything because it just continually reading but on paragraph 38 of things that are to be be 1965 1205 he said he's a being he just isn't a myth he even dwells in a house a place called Heaven e50 e352 Fellowship preaching 62 there is a certain place called Heaven that's where he's dwelling that's the point of what he's right and you know where he calls that from and brother random was in the Bible where are you going to go in the Bible then brother Dale to bring something up as to being before before that we uh start our journey downward to make us all right let's go with what he's saying God dwells in a house he dwells in a place he has a dwelling place it's called Heaven Y and you know the scripture he gave in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you so before this world ever come into any form of being God already existed God already was there he already had a Dwelling Place and he' already created the Angels before this world was ever thought about come or ever came into being in Genesis one look at the next one I love this one this is M this is number four brothers this is a message of adoption and look what he says that is he's not only is he infinite he's omniscient he knows everything but he is a being God is a to being and out of this being begin to bring forth these out of this being but Brother D you mean do you think that God before the world was real in the terminologies of our human word real no no no no he was more real than our terminology of the word real amen that's right he was more real than what we think about being real well you sound like some extraterrestrial place or some place I well what do you explain it as it's called Heaven it's a house the prophet would call it sir so what do you think about it see we only want to dwell with what comes on down into Earth Earth and that's why I've tried my best to get you to see the the real truth of one God in the bases of because according to my Bible it says that he was born Lord the Christ he was born the Messiah it warn Emmanuel that's right you know y all right then if that be true the body yes was a creation by the word but when that body Dro from the wound of Mary and come into being God himself amen not another person amen God himself stepped into that body of course the way they want it now you can't get him to be God until he's 33 on on or about 30 on the River Jordan of all these doctrines now but where you going to put it together with anything that's truthful in the Bible that's right but you know that's what everybody wants they don't want the truth they want some concept that keeps jangling it around that requires no understanding no Revelation that spirit and that soul of almighty God dropped into that body right amen don't you believe he had eternal life in his soul amen don't you believe that that inward part of him was eternal amen watch it when we get on over in the message a little when brother randam talks about that and the scripture declares it that you can't tempt God but Jesus could be tempted the flesh man right could be tempted who was that one brother Dale that you think about and talk about I thought your Prophet said it was little Jehovah crying in a cradle you're god with no teeth now what was he referring to the body was a creation but that Soul and Spirit was not a creation he was almighty God or yet he was or else he wasn't God then if that spirit that came into him was just a human spirit and that Soul just a human formed Soul then we have no savior amen right yes he is not Our Redeemer that's he not to be made Our Redeemer and made our savior avor but he's not right he just couldn't pay the price he was born the Messiah but he couldn't manifest being the Messiah right he was born Lord the Christ right the Christ he was born that he was born because it was God y right amen do you understand what I'm what I'm trying to say right he's this is not mythologies that's right this is talking about about a reality brother BR said either he was God or what did he say are the biggest deceiver that has ever been but around the world today they're rejoicing about Jesus wouldn't god Till The River Jordan I know the quotes I don't worry about it I'll go along with a point if they keep it in the right way he became then totally the fullness of the godhead bodily on the River Jordan yes but he was born Lord the Christ he's just come into manifestation there cuz he was born to fullness right amen he was born the all in all sir amen you see why did you know I I get something I think well I just go on to questions and answers and just the whole week it just uh don't do it it won't work so I rewrote rewrote rewrote finally stopped writing I said I'll just let the prophet say it and then they can argue about whatever they want to maybe this is somebody on the internet maybe it's whatever I don't know maybe it's me I have no problems I just try to bring you what's on my heart because that's the only place I can preach from outside of that I'm preaching for somebody else's mind or in intelligence I believe in a reality of true Living God Amen that's right well let see him anybody in the building want to see him just turn around and take a look right that's right yes sir because we're either a Christian or we're we're not a Christian and if we're a Christian we're God in human flesh that's right so now that's your choice but do you see what I'm talking about he condescended down to be that baby right yep right when that baby dropped from the wound was Soul into the Spirit came into that body and there was almighty God now that's not Oneness because in that body was Father Son and Holy Ghost the trunity of God not the Trinity the trunity of God but look look what he says go ahead to number five look what what he said on God keeps his word 57 while I bring it up I'll start reading I believe that Jesus is the son of God I believe that in in body he was a man he was born of a woman just like I was but his blood was not a woman it was of God and Jehovah God the Loos who brewed over the Earth in my message this morning and brewed the first man Out of the Dust of the earth overshadowed Mary and brewed over her to fulfill his word word and created the blood cell that brought forth the son of the Living God I believe in body he was a man all right I believe in his soul he was God it was God's manifestation here on Earth God was in Christ reconciling the world reconcile him the world to himself I believe that he was not just a mere man neither was he a prophet he was God Emmanuel I believe with all my heart that being truth in body he was a man in Soul he was God look at the next one Conference 1959 see he thirsted like a man he's talking about how he was doing he was a man in body he was a man in spirit he was God God dwelt in Christ reconcil the world to himself God came down y right you remember he didn't send a son right he came himself amen so when he came into the world what was he God himself that's why brother randam and I gave you these the other day that we can we can go on to what on the message in tun number seven what did he say his soul his Spirit his is theophany of his own being you didn't have no problem putting Soul spirit theophany being together because what is a soul it's you think about it did he have that theophany body number eight go ahead adoption and Paul said it does not yet appear just exactly what kind of a body we'll have but we know we'll have a body like he is what did he ever have that theophany body yes sir when he died the Bible said he a personal pronoun again he went to hell and preached to the souls in prison hallelujah how did he do it he had senses of feeling he had senses of hearing he had senses of speech he preached with the same kind kind of body I saw those glorified ones in the other night and he preached to the souls that were in hell that repented not in the longsuffering the days of Noah so what went there his soul is being is theophany the spirit of God you can call it well because it was was him all right are you following me when he went down to those people what kind of a body were they in go ahead number nine which is questions and answers on Hebrews I'll not leave my soul in Hell neither will I suffer the only one to see corruption about that here his body was in the grave and his soul was in Hell preaching alive what about that he was in his the again his soul was down there with those people that were in theophany also now watch you and was witnessing to them that they repented not in the longsuffering you can move him over real easy to Abraham Isaac you know the ones in there right but he ain't saying that he saying they were in their theophany you but brother Dale that's what I'm we'll get to later on I got to cover one more thing then Sunday we'll get to that so you think your theophan is up in heaven well we'll get to and go through it I believe that theophany is the soul of the Lord Jesus Christ and for us to ever be born again we're going to have to have that new birth that's right amen and that means then our soul will be made Eternal but a sinner also has a body to go to he's not just floating around he's a soul under the altar I mean souls in prison see the reality look he was witnessing to them in other words he knocked at the door now he's moving from this group of people to another group of people right got remember he done that you remember he went to hell he come back up do I need to get that from the prophet he came back up by Paradise you can't put hell in Paradise together he came back up you remember he kicked Satan over in the pit came back up all right in other words he knocked at the door and when the door swung open and all those Souls that repented what about these up here repented not these soul that repented he said I'm the seed of the woman I'm the one that Enoch over in Paradise another place he said don't get all them messed up what was it did God ever have a body at least you can see that he had a theophany body we I no problems with that look at the next one which is the in tment paragraph 50 we know that in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily the entire godhead was in him he was both Father Son and Holy Ghost but dwelt in a human form the theophany of God the great image of God that he made man in then placed him in the earth he had a body God isn't without a body God's got a body and it looks like a man Moses saw it others saw it and it looks like a man you got to agree that he had to the off anybody why not just go on and think about how real God really is amen what was he let's see yeah let's look at the next one look at number 11 and think about this theophany okay and it was the theophany of God that went out in the human form that didn't have eyes like you see watch a better eye it didn't have ears like you hear but a far more hearing it was a theophany and all this rainbow condescended into theophany Moses saw it when it passed through the rock like that he saw the back Parts he said it looked like a man so then you're going to have to agree that the theophany is a body amen right and to agree in that it being a body what kind of a body are you talking about that's what I was trying to get too Sunday for us to see go ahead to number 12 who is this Mel eddi then we'll we'll get down to the part we want to cover so this is paragraph 55-56 now of who is this melch now notice his attribute then the attributes was first God the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed secondarily he became the the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us St John the first chapter the first verse notice this is in the beginning but before the Eternal that's wonderful isn't it notice in the beginning was the word when the time began it was word but before it was word it was attribute of thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression in other words you know yourself what brother Brown has said he said God standing there and said in his great mind he sees what he's going to do instead he simply says Let There be all right now we went through a whole bunch of services is to prove that Jesus was Jesus Christ is the Creator God right Colossians 1 Hebrews 1 John 1 Ephesians 3 and9 all things were created by who Jesus Christ not Jesus the flesh Jesus Christ and if there was not anything made that's right without him making it amen but brother Dale you're putting Jesus I didn't put Jesus the flesh back there I made that emphatically for 40 years it wasn't the Jesus the flesh standing back there it was Jesus the word God himself cuz there's just one true and living God like look what he's saying in the beginning expression when it uh in the beginning was the word when the time began it was word before it was word it was attribute of thought and Express in the beginning was the expression the word and we're getting where mesic is that's this mysterious person in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and then the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us hold that there now notice he his his being was Spirit God Supernatural all right the great Eternal second he begin to form himself towards flesh in a theophany is called the word a body this then is the state he was in when he met Abraham and was called mzc he was in the form of theophany now we'll get to that and prove it in a few minutes the Lord willing he was the word what is a theophany the word body a word body you see Jesus Christ came through that way as word body because Jesus Christ is the creator you got to tie your Bible together come on because according to Colossians 1 John 1 Hebrews 1 all of it is pointing to the Creator that's why I said what I have and I always have believed it when he said who do Man say I the son of man am Peter and them couldn't understand that because it wasn't revealed right Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God he said Upon This Rock Revelation I'll build my church let's build on the revelation of Jesus Christ that's why it was so valuable and so important it had to be it had to be a Prophet come back in the last days that's what I was speaking on a couple of weeks ago Ezekiel in the Valley of the dry bones without Ezekiel speaking to those Dry Bones it wouldn't matter they had to send you they had the flesh the bones was together but when Ezekiel spoke life came in too those Dry Bones I think folks you and I it's about time to start realizing how dry these old bones are you know what I mean by that our old d ational ideas and thoughts is dry bones to God it took a prophet to come if he hadn't said let there be a Rapture you go read the message that thrilled me when I saw it he said it has been spoken now let it be come to pass why did see that's why I preach so I do Church born as a prophet said by the Breath of God he's going to breathe and these bodies are going to be but it's not breathing like that that we have to wait for him to breathe when he spoke it that is the Breath of God the word of God coming out of the man's mouth don't make the man God it makes the God that was coming now here's the point we got to get to because you see in the message now the basics of the message people they they like the quote where brother Brown says you always was eternal I do too I like it put in the right order right amen they like those things because they think and people pre actually preach that we come into the world with eternal life now where do you get that from the prophet right but it was just predestinated all brother Brown said we had representation by predestination he said we had representation from predestination but remember then if representation is by predestination and representation is from predestination that means somebody else paid the price and we don't have anything to do with it you better remember that Adam came with Eve in him Eve didn't come first with Adam in her that's what you're saying they don't realize it but that's the doctrine well there so many quotes like I said take all the quotes read them listen to the message when brother brownon says you always was eternal just listen to what he says he said if you have eternal life tonight you always was eternal I agree with that 100% cuz my Bible says that that his seed remaineth in me and I cannot sin right but I know that I'm a sinner every day but I know the seed can't sin right but you don't believe you born with a seed in you a seed of representation from predestination right all I've asked is where was it at and how did he get there that's all I've asked this is going around the world if they want to listen to it come and explain it where's it at well I was born with this seed in me because the reason I was born with this seed in cuz I wasn't born like you you had never heard it t that if you was born from Adam's lineage you could be saved but if you was born from the Beast lineage you could not be saved now show me that in the Bible show me in the prophet's message show it to them in common sense lay aside all things it's common sense but see people don't want to talk to you like that I got this great Revelation this seed was in me I said okay where's the seed at was it in your body was in your spirit it was in your soul where was it at and after you get it all settled out are trying to make it somewhere then I'm going to give you a quote and let's see if you can swallow that one brother R said the seed was put in you before the foundation of the world now I believe it that way amen that's 1,00% correct right because before the foundation of the world he stood as a lamb slain and my name could be written in the Lamb's Book of Life and remember if it wasn't written there it never will be in there if it wouldn't written before the foundation of world so what about us as human beings then you've talked about God we talk about it we believe God is real believe God could condescend downward start so great until he was beyond all things of comprehensions of what we could think about him that there had to be a Heavens there had to be a place that they had to be Angels there they had to be all kind of things before the world ever started but what about you and I so I said that's what I said and I went back listen to the tape I said I got to do it cuz that's going to be hinging on something so hang on to it let's go ahead and do it let's I ask you to read who is this m chadic or listen to the tape I ask you to do that so why can't we do it you know it's all right we just finished up paragraph 55-57 and talk about his first being with Spirit God Supernatural the second he began to form himself toward flesh in a theophany it's called the word of body this is the state he was in when he made El met Abraham was called melic he was in the form of theophany now now pick up paragraph 67 flip over to number 13 and we'll read down through a good bit starting with paragraph 67 who is this Mel jezdic and I see the attribute sons of his Spirit have not yet entered into the word form body but if I come here with it in me I would be coming like Jesus remember we didn't come like Jesus he came straight from attribute thought Express word come down to the Old Testament as the theoy the word body that created all things through the prophets he stood on Earth as being Eternal Emmanuel God living in human flesh the soul the spirit of God entered into that baby and he walked forth and there was eternal life living in that Soul they could not kill that Soul they could not kill that Spirit right right they could only kill the body but don't worry about it he raised that up all right but you see we didn't get to come that way what what he says while we come see we see the attribute sons of his Spirit have not yet entered into the word formed body we haven't done it yet all right you say well we have the new birth you better hold on the scripture read that we have the earnest how would you like to have where brother Ram said your soul is not complete it only has the earnest sure a lot in the message folks look but at the ofne this body is subject to the word and Earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body okay we know that's going to happen now the difference between him and you as a son see we he was at the beginning the word and in morphe body he came in and lived in that in the person of mzc then later we heard no more of mzc because he became Jes Jesus Christ mzc was the priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypass that okay because in that form he knowed all things y Jesus Christ right you have never been able to know that yet we're limited right all right you come like Adam like me you become from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we've done now we don't understand it we have never become the word we just become the flesh man not the word all right now that's explaining just the simple terminologies of mankind don't get so involved and run your mind over into but I'm Eternal and I have this and I've become we'll get to that just stay with me where I'm at we come into the world lost born in sin shaping in iniquity spouse my mother's wound a liar that's right amen where can you put eternal life in all of that and come on remember my stud if you come into the world with eternal life you don't need Jesus Christ what could he give you ackowledge that you were Eternal right I don't want a knowledge I want something real now you can play all you want to with knowledges I've been accused of being a knowledgeable person and in that knowledgeable person you're looking at is one thing for certain I want Jesus Christ as my savior he's my all and my all and I want that new birth with inside of me and not just some idea of mankind right sir am and watch what he said you see in order to stand Temptation you had to bypass the theophany okay y but but what I can't understand because you juggle it about because you talked about a sinner having a theophany i is talking about him having a body to go to cuz that's the fir form and words of the word theophany see we got to get down to where we can understand it that brother randam said before you was born again you had an undercurrent to you remember that that's right he said but after you're born again you start an upward Lord pull are current to you right all right we'll explain these as we go along but just hold on you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin now watch my point the outside man of MDC could eat a calf the Inside Man was a theophany that didn't need nothing to eat theophanies don't eat see the outside of a man that walked on the shores of Galilee 2,000 years ago the outside part the flesh could be tempted right but the man that was inside of there couldn't be tempted man on the outside was hungry thirsty body dwindling away in the desert the Inside Man said when the devil says turn this and take this and do this the Inside Man spoke out through the outside man and says get behind me cuz he wasn't thirsty outside man was what was thirsty some of these days we'll understand so he come right down now watch it's talking about Jesus Christ so listen he come right down the regular line from attribute he he did the flesh Jesus the man the foundation World his name is put on the lamb book of life then from that he become the word the theophany that could appear disappear then he become flesh and return back again resurrected that same body in the glorified state or condition that's Jesus Christ right that ain't me and you all right but you by pass the theophany and become flesh man to be tempted by sin and then if this Earthly Ty Tabernacle is dissolve we have one already waiting we have not yet the bodies right we'll get into that more Sunday but look when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God throws your body into subjection look roll it on up we'll just get to the last part he's talking about there buried baptism you're a new creation in Christ Jesus subject to the spirit trying to live by the spirit of Jesus Christ all right how far did we get go ahead with the next one go this paragraph 76 now this body is subject to the spirit have not yet entered into the word form now what's he saying this body is subject to the spirit have not yet entered into the word form but we are still in the flesh form but subject to the word Death In the Flesh will take us there you drop dead right now Split Second you're already there right come on the word form is this right here the new birth is a birth of the word called Faith but the stature of a perfect man and then The Headstone coming is the word form you want to quote he said we become the word here right if we don't become the word here you know what that means we wouldn't have word there sensible roll it on up breathe the breath of life and need Scream out sure as a natural body being formed there's a spiritual body to receive it as soon as it gets there I agree with that then when a man is Born Again from Heaven he becomes a spirit baby in Christ and then when this robe of flesh is dropped there is a natural body what's what he calls it the the Natural Body theophany a body not made with hands neither born of a woman that we go to then that body returns back and picks up the glorified body that's the reason Jesus went to hell when he died he preached to the soul that were in prison turn back into that theophany oh marvelous thank God 2 Corinthians 51 if this Earthly body be dissolved this Earthly Tabernacle we have another one that's true right we do sure but is it up there waiting now remember don't pick up too many bodies as you're going through the studying of the message because in no reference whatsoever have I made tonight in any form talking about a word body that I was not talking about bringing that word into full manifestation because Jesus Christ was the word made flesh and before you and I get out of here somebody is going to be the word made flesh that's right not trying to make us Jesus Christ we ain't got to nothing worry about it back it's what we are so look what he said you see we have another one but is it up there or is it something that the minute you die you go there see we've bypassed that to come straight from God the attribute to flesh to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did but when testing of his word his word is over then we are taken up to this body that was a prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is the word there that we skipped to come right around down here to be tempted and tested if we to have come true that y there'd have been no temptation that's right right now there's what I explained while IO did you hang on Jesus the outside man could be tempted right but the inside of the man couldn't be tempted mzd could stand there in human flesh the human flesh was eaten mesic was inside of it cuz there's your word body I know that blanks out okay that's the reason Jesus knowed all things because he was the word before he was flesh then we become the word here we are formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey but but but but Brother D that's that's all it's just a spark of life it it's something it's something that was in me I I just feel like it yeah and there was a guy named Napoleon that I hope they can see what I'm doing and sticking my hand in Napoleon you know he stood and he believed he was reincarnated from somewhere else do we believe in reincarnation brother randam says what 154 is that what it did Church age book he said I don't believe in the Mormon doctrine of pre-existence of souls neither do do I believe in reincarnation and he said I don't believe in transmigration y now have you ever looked up transmigration according to Webster transmigration means going from one body to another body and brother Brown didn't believe that amen so we better not believe it cuz Jesus never went from one body to another body but you see Jesus didn't need a new birth that's right because he always was eternal the soul was eternal but you and I needed a new birth that makes our soul Eternal that makes it to be that look at the last one One Number 15 go ahead brothers and after you recognize the word of God was eag food what is that the new birth can we sum that up by saying that that after you received the new birth then you're left the other thing you know You' died out to the world you gone from you have been formed into the living image of the Living God now watch what it said you heard from you're theophany there's a positive of God's mind look at the pyramid behind me and you look at it it is not negative to positive it's partial to perfect you start off the bottom of the Pyramid of faith and you come to the top of the up to the pyramid at top and it's called love which is Faith which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and full full manifestation the day you was born again you heard from your theop you heard from a positive part of God that he had in his mind you and I would come to Martin Luther one day God spoke to a man he said to Joshua live by faith you know what that was part of the word right Luther heard from his theophany right but there was just no way he could bring together the thoughts and the ideas so he must pass on Wesley when sanctification come forth which was the word of God he heard from his theophany but there was no way he could comprehend isusa Street came forth with the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Brandon called it another great prophet of the baptism of the Holy Ghost they heard from their theophany because they were born again amen but they could never in no way to attain to that headstone because your Prophet said The Headstone hadn't come yet that's his words all right here comes a prophet to be able to stand and take the word of God and he said 30s something years before he could preach the statue of a perfect man that's in the message there yet he was preaching all around it and saying things like on the message interv where he talks about a living instrumentality of God walking on two feet he said I've been preaching these things but he said the other day I got this right here that ties it all together when he got into the seals he's refers back to the great message the stature of a perfect man when he gets over into the message bringing it he refers back constantly to the stature of a perfect man you see the day you got born again you heard from God but that's only the earnest of your inheritance until the Redemption of I quoting scripture of the purchased possession he paid the price for this right but he didn't claim it he's coming in his last days or may I restate that he came in this last days through the word or message of of this Prophet that's what I believe that he came through the message of this Prophet to claim these bodies you yeah but he died and went by the grave what's that got to do with it Jesus died too now don't don't make fun don't make Jesus died would you see church if the theophany is the word body see we by pass coming like Jesus because remember Jesus stood there and spoke the word Jesus Christ may I get it more correctly where won't be misunderstood Jesus Christ stood there and spoke the word of Let There Be Right had we come that way there would have been no temptation within that person but we bypass that part and even a born again believer who has eternal life dwelling within him by the new birth until that stature of a perfect man comes into being you've got the earnest of your inheritance I receive the Holy Ghost Brother D I got everything I want that in the Bible and I want it in the prophet's message the Bible says you got an Earnest the prophets said you got an Earnest a part payment y sure we bypassed what we should have come you realize that if Stan hadn't entered the picture what this thing would have done we would have come like Jesus that's right there's no need to talk about it because it didn't come that way cuz he could not display his attributes and the things that he desired as it to come that way but what if Satan had never entered the picture what if man had never fallen after the devil's life folks I'm glad I've heard from the Eternal God sir to come down at least enough to save my soul to give me his own life you can't become the word until you hear the word come on there was no way if you listen to what I said there was no way Luther could have done it no way Wesley could have done it no way Pentecost could have done listen now no way the great Apostle Paul could have ever attained unto that place or else why did he have to send a prophet if you think Paul could have attained then why did not he attain yes he spoke he prophesied but everything he prophesied never come to a reality he spoke of a change of the body a moment the twinkle of an eye he spoke of the corruptible becoming Incorruptible he spoke of those things but then he died and went by the grave but the Lord Jesus Christ spoke of the those things he went by the grave but he raised cuz death couldn't hold him why because he was the word and he'd already said it take this body do what you want to with it I'll raise it up in three days and it took place what about the real you as I said there's no need of thinking about it but you know sometimes it is good it is good to think about what is sin that never entered the picture wouldn't it be a wonderful place am but you know what in the soul of mankind by the new birth that position is already attained we are just waiting the Redemption of these bodies nothing been paid for it's a finished product but waiting is that the scripture waiting but at least we ought to be able to quote the scriptures where it says the last part is to wit the Redemption of our bodies look up that word to wit I know what it means it wits and all kind of but look it up and see is to understand you and I would have never understood nothing about these chains of the body or anything that we talk about had it not been for God sending a prophet to bring the word unto us thank God he kept his word you know what all he wants you and I to keep our word to believe him right come on Brothers come on musicians we bypass why because listen may I say this while they're coming down Atlanta there's a place called 285 I mean two u n what is it 285 going around Atlanta all right going around Atlanta it's called a b pass that just keeps you from going through the middle if you want to go around but you know what now let's swallow and listen for a second and you're going to think I'm trying to change brother Brandon but no you listen he said we bypass that we never come that way right that's how we bypast the theophany we never come that way that's right that's simple to me we never came that way so by doing that we came straight from atribute as he thought of us before the foundation of the world and as he thought of himself as being healer and savior and all of those things of attribute we never came that way that's bypassing is to never come not if not then where are you going with it what we got brother 229 my God is real amen the we never come that word body form there are some things but we become a child of God by the new birth we study the word we let the word come in us and mold us and make us sure we fight the devil on every hand every day we battle with him that God is you know what your prophet said to do he said just turn him down that's a hard thing to do isn't it just turn him down my God is real for he hased and made me we're going to believe for everything to be all right with Anna tomorrow we give her this prayer CLA and believe in it father all is well and we thank you now bring it forth into a manifestation and father just touch the body make all things well touch the doctors and all the things we appreciate them Lord we thank you for all things but then we going to give you the credit the honor and the glory for all things CU you gave us the doctors to help us we love you by your stripes she's healed in Jesus name anybody else is I can in my heart my God is real re in my God is real for he has washed and made me whole our brother's asking for somebody else had a heart attack last night we just ask you to make all things well and may they come forth with a testimony saying the healing of God and what it is and how he's taking care of things because we believe you father in Jesus name anybody else just how you when Jesus you remember that you remember when he first touched you you remember when you cried out God forgive me and a great burden of things was taken from you we just keep on going it's just more word we want to get it in a big hurry you know according to the pro prophet Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph laid the foundation the prophets built the body of the Lord Jesus it took almost 6,000 years for them to do that yet we wanted this instantly are we the Seed of Abraham are we the Seed of Abraham Abraham waited 25 years everything got worse and worse and worse and worse but he kept saying we're going to H the baby amen why cuz God told him God tells you something you don't have to worry about it I like what brother Brown said he said if if God told me to go was it George Washington what he said he told me to go way is George Washington he said I'd call the world tell them to be there in the morning cuz they going to see George Washington walk out of the Grave that's how much he believed it well why can't we believe it that way I never did read where the Bible said all things are possible to Jesus Christ and nobody else and then I and read that it was all things were possible to Jesus Christ and the prophets and nobody else I I thought it read that all things are possible to them that believe that's right won't you ask for it sometime that's you know that a lot of people are really afraid to pray you ever notice you go to pray for people and they don't want you to pray positive pray if there's any way maybe that that this can work out that the Lord can can do these things you know pray that's not positive when you pray in positive you say Thank You Lord thank you Lord everything's off it's finished yeah would I done that one day brother Dale and it didn't work well you know what you wouldn't positive youed too negative to even talk about it think positive thank you Lord father we pray that what we said tonight would be enough to help us all to understand you because we've just tried to show people how real you are and Lord we know and realize that us as human Mortals don't have any hopes whatsoever but yet you Lord can come on the scene and change that hope and make it a revelation and bring us to reality we love you we thank you be with everybody on the way home Lord tonight just bless and take care of remember all things and just have your way in Jesus name amen you dismissed remember Bible study Saturday 6:00 How Sweet the Sound that Sav a rich like me I want was lost but now am was blind but now I see was Grace that taught my
