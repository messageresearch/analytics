coming Saturday will be Bible study remember Wednesday night will be brother Bob preaching for us you'll remember these announcements and this morning they were giving my wife uh the nurse was Dire and the therapy people were there and they really put her through today and they said it really done a marvelous job you know she was doing good you know but she didn't see us way it get the wave at her this morning and so everybody's got to wave again and let you know so wave at the piggy you know to Sister Dale if she's uh watching you know because we we miss her and uh I was in a hurry to get home but there's a little more to the story that I hope about uh Terence was talking about you know you have to watch him because sometimes he gives you what he wants you to hear and you got to put the rest of it together and we was doing 110 mile an hour going down the road but when we stopped to go out in the highway we were still running 50. so now if you can figure that out you'll be doing all right if you're sitting dead still running 50 mile an hour you can figure there's something wrong with the speedometer but you know that's that's good amen but good to be in the house of the Lord we love him and I pray that as we try to bring this today if we don't get through it'll be all right but I'm trying to get a point across now the point won't stop we will just move on into more scriptures and things and won't be relating to just the thoughts that we've been bringing but we'll still beyond the positive attitude because that's one that's the one thing I want us to have is a very positive attitude and I want you to listen today because I've I've had you know almost three weeks now to meditate upon trying to express what I believe I see and I remember promote said I said brother mode they're not getting it he said no wonder he said you spent 40 hours studying and preaching an hour and a half and think they can believe it can get it all said you know you have to kind of slow down so we'll we'll do that and then we'll have some review maybe next Sunday and maybe questions and answers about what we've been talking about so that way you can uh can can you know do those things but let's turn to Hebrews 11. and we'll go from 11 1 through 2 and then 11 chapter 11 11-13 to pick up her thought okay Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and your grace your kindness your all in all and thank you for being you thank you for opening our eyes that we may see you that we may know you in true life and understanding It's Your Love Lord could be made manifest in each one of our hearts and our lives because that's the desire we have we desire to see you living among us and to do what you want to do so we commit the whole service to you Lord we just ask you to do as you said you would you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so come Among Us this afternoon and speak to our hearts and our lives and heal these physical bodies that bother so much we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Hebrews 11 1-2 then 11 through verse 13. now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report now notice keep that in your mind they obtained a good report now when we read on over it's going to sound contrary to what this is saying but just remember we spent uh I don't know how many services now on a relationship of this to try to see that they did you know have a good report they did attain unto what was promised them all right but now we take in the Bible same Bible it's either explaining that let's go to verse 11. it says through faith also Sarah receives strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised now remember she had the promise right she received the promise right therefore spraying there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and is the sand which is by the seashore innumerable now watch these all died in faith having not received the promises yeah but having seen them afar off and we're persuaded of them and embraced them and confess that they were strangers in pilgrims on the earth amen you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now to start off saying reading that they obtained a good report and to know that they did achieve what God had promised to them in their day in their time but then to read and it says they all died in faith not having received the promises now what about that what were the promises they didn't receive all right so now remember that keep that in mind verse 16. I want to keep emphasizing that you know to where you'll think about it and I want you to look at the scripture so go ahead brothers and pull back up Hebrews 11 13. all right these all died in faith every one of them accomplished what God had told them right foreign there wasn't a one in there that was cold there's never been anybody told of God that they would bring forth something in them not bring it forth I was thinking the other day about what brother Branham said relating it I think with Brother Gary that brother Branham said he said if you're dying he says ever doctor in the world could be there and it would not stop it you would die but he said if you're there he said an Ever devil in hell was there to try to kill you he says they can't kill you until God is true with you all right there's never been anybody in the Bible that was a failure you remember that years ago I asked a challenge to point to you show me the worst person in the Bible that you think would be a failure and people were giving different ones and and I said well finally the one that I would think of was was um saw in that he went down to the witch of Endor he done all of these things and it looks bad but even by going to the witch of Endor and it finishing all up he ended up by God telling him you're going to be with me tomorrow there's never been a believer in the Bible that is a failure everybody has always accomplished what was set for them to do even if they tried to hinder it you know I mean we don't think about that do we we don't think about all through our life how we try to do the things we wanted to do and God wouldn't let us do it you know we don't consider that huh but notice now why would the Apostle Paul the great teacher just leave that up for a second will you the great teacher that he was spends so much time expressing that these all received the promise that was promised to them all right Abraham and Sarah child you know uh what could you go through David and God bringing forth a child even out of that situation the promises to the people and remember now this is verse 16. well verse 13 which is right in the middle then all at once he reverts right back seemingly saying they give a good report he brings out some of them then he says having not received the promises then he goes right back to the great warriors of faith and that was why I read that this morning from 17 through going on to the end of it but look what it says about him these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and we're persuaded of them and embrace them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they'd have been mindful of that country from which they came out they might have had opportunity to have stayed I'll just put a little point there to me when I read that I think about you know they were always wanting to go back to the garlics and the cucumbers you know but look but now they desire a better country that is a heavenly right they desire a better country it would be any place outside of living in the United States that I'd love to live would I'd love to live in Israel they can turn over a rock and plant a tree and it'll grow find water out in the middle of the desert go down to the to the Dead Sea and ride down through there and look out this way and it's just Barren desert you know nothing look over this way and it's just thousands of Acres of the most beautiful trees they said we can grow here in Israel anything that'll grow anywhere in the world salt literally salt from the Dead Sea laying around the trees some way they neutralized that see Danny knows about it waiting him does that Jacob got into a thing that there's a fertilizer now that they can it comes out of the ocean and it's really edible you know it'll make things grow see maybe they're learning back some of those things but look what it says but now they desire a country that is a heavenly word of God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city as I said they didn't receive the promise all right let's read go to number two and look what it says Hebrews 11 38 and 39 and 40. of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains and in dens and caves of the Earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith and he says they did now these all having a good report true faith received not to promise Paul you got my mind blow it all out of shape you're saying they had a good report then you're saying that they never received the promises and then we read a whole bunch more as we read this morning you know of David and Jefferson and all of the ones through there and he comes right back to his same point and he says and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise verse 40 now God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect now if you don't have the Holy Spirit your mind right today is as muddled as can be about that because you can never comprehend it right even with the holy spirit it's hard to think about that you spend all of that time with the great warriors of faith that made a good report that everything that was promised to them God gave it to them and yet Paul says not having received the promises but seeing them afar off then he says and he's all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise then he he hooks the key to the entire story into verse 40. because whatever they were not able now are you listening they received what was promised to them of the day that they were living are you with me every one of them we've spent all this time preaching about what they've done and the things and we could spend years preaching about all of the great warriors of faith and they achieved what God said they would receive to Abraham and Sarah child until David a child coming down and right out of there a Rahab to harlot and out of there coming down through into the lineages of David that who wasn't Jacob and and who was the woman Tamar maybe even out of an adulterous act that your Prophet said it was adultery come a child that out of there came a lineage that came down so now I want you to think with me what would Paul be saying they received what they were told that they would get why does he double-state it verse 13 and then what verse 39. why would he make that statement and say that they receive not the promise the other one says promises then he puts the answer to his whole layout into verse 40. and he says they without us cannot be made perfect now watch the Gentiles Got to Do with It because that's who he's talking about right right what have we got to do with the Perfection of Israel are you thinking let me put it this way because I know it's going to be a hard one I'll have to keep trying to explain in a few messages as I was saying this morning that without Sarah Abraham no matter how much Faith he had could not have brought the child Isaac into being he could have took a hundred wives had a hundred children and he still wouldn't have had the promise of God right he wouldn't have had Isaac right so was God waiting on Abraham to get the revelation in which he's really waiting on Sarah to get it you know all right what was the point in the message that the Bride of Jesus Christ he's a special group of people amen the end I brought down through seven Church ages and there was no leaven among the church ages yeah we can look at all of the wrong they've done but God does not see that but he does not see Abraham and all of the giving his wife away and the doubtings and the laughing and pleading with him to let Ishmael be the promise neither does he see anything in Sarah when he writes to Sarah he doesn't right of her wrongs will you go with me on that all right then how simple is it is it then to realize that he doesn't see our wrongs because he's not looking at our lives that we live he's looking at the atonement he made in our place because with Abraham he made and what unconditional Covenant is it Bible and I'd read my unconditional Covenant then the guy starts lying giving his wife away all kind of deceivings life in it God because of what he says is going to happen and God don't count that and he said he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving God to honor and glory to know that he take care of it see then I could really get down and preach some if I had a little time because you could preach about Abraham that maybe Abraham had a little better understanding than we think maybe Abraham thought maybe I can save my neck to keep that King from killing me because God said we're going to have that baby in lord it's up to you to keep that King from getting my wife see I could do some preaching but that's what a lot of people likes to hear but get back to the point these all obtained a good report to a personal experience with God for whatever it was for their day their time right but they received not to promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect so whatever Israel is to ever attain unto are you listening whatever Israel will ever attain unto and we have a Bible full of what they will be 144 000 saved now behold the Israel will be saved as a whole in the basis of the ones whose names were written there the Millennium is to the Jews all right well you know what they're not going to get that unless this group Paul calls us has something to do with it now what do we got to do with it what do we got to do with it it's good to think about the US and like brother dick likes it this way Paul's standing there saying us a few days later his head cuts off and he's in the grounds saying y'all get me out of here huh he went from us to them right but what do we have to do with Israel obtaining the promises and what are the promises and if we do not achieve it if you don't get nothing out of the message today I wish you'd write this thought down if we don't come to a place to bring forth the promises of God then there is no hope for anyone behind us because we'll get over in it when we finish this if we have time don't worry brother random uses a day without us cannot be made perfect in the Statue of a perfect man and says see down Through the Ages they're waiting on you and I let's don't even deal with down Through the Ages until we get an opportunity let's deal with Israel let's deal with the people that we've read of called Hebrews 11 doesn't speak of the Gentiles he's speaking of Israel all right he said wait a minute well then let me say it this way and we'll get back to it in another message or two even those that have died like Paul Paul received the promises don't say that right down Through the Ages didn't receive the promises them through the church ages because they did let's deal with Israel alone well people on the internet follow that line or thought let's think about all of these in Hebrews 11. yet they achieved everything that God said they would do that's what Paul's explaining right he's explaining how all of these obtain that that they were told that they would do Abraham and savior a child David coming over this with that one all the promises they all received it Joshua walled falling down you know all the way through with they without us cannot be made perfect now brother Dale now what can we have to do with making Israel perfect that's what I'm asking you I'm glad you thought of that that's what I'm asking you so what does that word perfect mean Scofield references it back as to Matthew 5 48. where it says be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and Scofield at that incident says that sinless Perfection is not even the question he said it's completeness or a full age so the word perfect is not dealing with us bringing them out of the grave and doing something to them to make them perfect he wasn't listening a minute ago if you're thinking that away because Paul that became one of them had the promises that Israel needed now what does that word perfect mean then go ahead with 2A and let's pull it up and give the definition is it 50 48 basic same definition as uh we're speaking of a day without us cannot be made perfect and if that doesn't mean anything to do with a sinless Perfection because we know we cannot give salvation to anyone Etc right all right look what the definition of it means to make perfect perfect to finish they without us cannot be finished to fulfill they without us cannot it cannot be fulfilled they can't be perfect look to make perfect complete to carry through completely to accomplish to finish to bring to an end they without us now cannot carry through completely they cannot accomplish what they were set out to do they cannot finish what was said for them they cannot bring to an end to complete perfect in the words add what is yet wanting in order to render a thing full to be found perfect to bring to the end our goal proposed they without us and not come to an end that's proposed for them to accomplish in other words bring to a close or fulfillment by event the Prophecies of the scriptures I love that Without You and I Israel cannot come to the promises that was made to them of the prophecies through the scriptures foreign you really have got me now honey but let's think about it a minute very few notes so let's think about it a minute What could you and I to do or whatever what we could do or not do or what would it be that could bring Israel to a state that the Prophecies of the scriptures said they would achieve very slow this afternoon I want you to think not sleep think I like to do that I like it like that man said that time he said I had asked a question and nobody in the building couldn't answer it and his brother got up he said I hate it when a man asked a question and he's the only one in the building that had the answer I said I wouldn't have asked it if I hadn't had the answer I would not have asked the question had I not had the answer to it oh brother Dan what does that make you a smart alec do what you want to that's all right with me I've asked you a question the pulpit is yours to explain it what is Israel waiting on and what is it dependent upon for them to even have the ability to wait oh okay let's go with it for a little bit or to keep your mind in the right Channel you know that it was promised to Israel to get eternal life all right we've all been real careful and we've been nice and we got it it's took me 40 years to plant the seed of it but it's all right to get you to the point of thinking that the Old Testament science did not have the new birth they didn't have eternal life in their soul if they did why did Jesus have to die that's what the Bible says said the Holy Ghost not given because Jesus has not been glorified all right so they did not have eternal life and the great Enoch walked off the Earth and went somewhere Elijah took a chariot ride and went somewhere but did not have eternal life in their soul while they were on Earth all right so now we've concluded that that they never attained unto certain promises we have a time we have concluded that they did get what God told them they would get for the time right right so Paul's right they made a good report but they never achieved or attained into the promise and it was promised unto him John John 1 11-12 we we want to read John 1 uh go ahead and pull that one up number three we like to read John we like to read one up to so far and then jump over to verse 14. but we don't look at a lot of the scriptures look what it says he came unto his own in his own received him not who's he talking about Jews Israelites right we know the difference in Jews and Israelites okay we've been through all that not all Israel's Israel I don't Jews are Jews but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name so what was promised Israel that they never attained we're talking about a nation people a group of people they never attained eternal life even though it was promised unto him and many Jews Israelites I don't even want to call them did receive eternal life because they did receive the new birth because the book of Acts was basically Jews with a few Gentiles placed within it all right so now some of the people received it what was the promise to Israel that they never received eternal life right but not receiving eternal life look at number five go ahead brother last to number four excuse me I think that's where I'm at no number is 10. John 10 28 okay would you believe not because you're not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me now Israel was ever one the Sheep of God what is Jesus speaking of right they were the chosen right and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand there was a chosen of Israel that received eternal life on the day of Pentecost and through the book of Acts and through the times and until this day still Jews are being saved Paul said you think we couldn't be saved he said well here I am I got it and that's put in plain language yeah but he gave eternal life to all that would have accepted him the Jews first is it the Bible and then unto the Gentiles right the Jews received it because Upper Room experience with all 120 word Jews basics of the book of Acts was Jews a few gentiles so now that some of Israel did receive eternal life but what about the rest of Israel what about those that were blinded you know the ones that received eternal life we're not blinded and they were the means by where we received eternal life because the Jews brought the message of Salvation to the Gentiles right the prophet said the Gentiles must take the message back to Israel right okay Matthew number five and I say unto you that many shall come from the East and West and sit down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out into outer Darkness there shall be weeping the nation of tea who was the kingdom too when Jesus was talking to the disciples he said I give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom who's he talking to Jews Israelites whatever way you want to say it to make it correctly he wasn't speaking to the Gentiles at that period of time and come on in later he goes on in Matthew 23 and 37 number 5A said oh Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that killeth the prophets and stone us them which are sent unto thee how oft would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathered her chickens under her wings and you would not so we know for a certainty that eternal life was one of the things the promise is remember Paul said promises in one place the other said promise so we know eternal life was one thing they couldn't receive because they turned it down right the kingdom was one thing that was to them but could not number six John 14 25 and 26. these things I've spoken unto you yet being present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things you remembers whatsoever I've said so by not receiving eternal life they didn't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost they didn't get a comforter now we're finding a good many promises that Israel never attained into Romans 3 and 1 number seven what advantage then hath to do or what prophet is there to circumcision much wherever way chiefly because that unto them were committed the Oracles of God the word of God was committed to Israel but when they turned down the word made flesh right they lost a possibility of being saved right they lost the ability for the kingdom to come into being right they never received a comforter so the death of Jesus Christ had nothing to do for them at that time the word the oraclees Earth wherever how you pronounce that word that means the word of God came to the Jews look at Romans 9 and 3 number eight for I could wish that myself were a curse from Christ for my brethren My Kinsman according to the flesh who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the Covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and Promises adoption pertain to Israel you and I had nothing in the Bible pertaining to us except a few types and shatters right condemnation was all we had dogs heathen aren't you glad God looked down through there and picked you up though I hope you're thinking because what were the things that was promised to Israel that they never attained unto eternal life the kingdom being present right there God would have stepped right down on Earth through the or was down there on Earth if they'd just received him you know what you and I wouldn't even be in the picture right so there were things that was promised to them that they never got but there was a group of them that did receive and were a part of the bride of Christ the reason it called Gentiles is because that just means Nations that means anybody can come in now and be in the Gentile dispensation it was really the Gen it was really the Jewish part at Pentecost because they were all Jews but then the Gentiles got brought in all right but yet all of Israel was not rejected because some of Israel came into being in this Gentile dispensation in being born again Christians but there was another part of Israel that never attained to that now that's what I want you to think about Abraham got the promise of the son Isaac Sarah received strength to conceive and bring forth the child but that never brought eternal life to Abraham and Sarah even though they were turned back to young man young woman it it didn't give them eternal life they died after then you know see then what was it that David would cry out in his spirit and seeing those psalms of they pierced my hands and my feet to sound like he's talking about his own self but yet he was prophesying of a coming Messiah all of those that was spoke of to come to Israel that's why I said we could take all of the Hebrew and keep preaching for six months or year on it and see that they did attain but yet they never got the full promise what was the definition of perfect they never came to completion they never came to an end of their lives or whatever was meant to them until this day they are vagabonds wandering the Earth fighting forever inch of ground that they have but yet God has not forsaken them brother Forney I hadn't read that but I believe it happened but some of you may know it and I didn't never read it word that that bomb was heading over toward it and it just turned and went out in the ocean I believe all that because God taking care of Israel you know I mean it looked like after a while they shot 2 000 Rockets after a while if I'd Shot 2 000 Rockets I could keep increasing my range and my ability to fire correctly even if I had to take one and walk across there you know I mean after a while I'd get something right but yet it fell all around Israel a few little things happened I mean you want to you want to live here in Lula what is it about the size of Indiana I mean no no yeah I guess it's about right Israel something like that and you got 2 000 bombs falling down and it just don't hardly do any damage looked like I'd while they get lucky you know we know there ain't no such thing as luck and we know that God is fighting for Israel brought her back to her Homeland because it was promised in the word we know that God one day will give 144 000 eternal life while you're up on the Earth because it was promised to them we know that then Israel as a nation will get the millennium of this promise to them right how much they have to do in the future home I don't understand because I know we read that in the scripture that they serve a city and we know that Abraham was hunting for a city and brother Brown said he was right down under it you know all the time he said because that's where that future home is coming but my main point is what do we have to do with it well you said it want to go brother Dale the Jews brought it to us and we take it back to them all right you want to take a few thousand and send Bibles joking if it's just carrying them back that away let's just get a bunch of Bibles and we'll fly over there and we'll pass them out I'm going to do it Prophet said you can do all you want to oh yeah they have a prostolide every once in a while or maybe a part of a gentile you know bride to be in Israel you want to talk about part of the bride of Christ is in Israel now and uh but that's not the Israel we're talking about why was it that Abraham didn't get eternal life what was it David didn't get eternal life foreign myself you know everybody I know the rest of the Bible too if you know everybody's saying well brother Daniel questions the end of strife no question shows how stupid you are that's why gender strife questions showed how dumb you are because you don't know the answer to the question and if you don't know the answer to the question there's no need of running your mouth off about thinking you do huh what do we have to do with this thing we can read the rest of it and what we got down about Paul and Roman talking about that God hadn't Cast Away his people and how that some were blinded for us but some came in and received eternal life in the book of Acts right but the Israel that this mainly speaking of is still in the grave waiting on you and I all right watch the people down Through the Ages we'll cover that a little bit maybe then come back to it what did all of these down through here waiting on do the ages when to ever won we're talking about bride has eternal life they received eternal life and they're perfect in God so there's nothing we can do to raise them to make them more perfect but there's something they didn't get that's dependent upon you and I you know what that is even Paul didn't get a change in the body come on you can't put Paul waiting on a whole lot of promises one promised Paul's waiting on is that a promise he spoke of in the scripture change in a moment of Twinkle and I that's what's holding that New Testament in the ground that's why they're waiting on you and I but what connection do we have to Israel David Sampson what connection do we have to be bringing them to a completion to a finish to uh perfected state which is not sinless talking about is talking about a completion do you realize that God looked down he knew the Jews were going to do what they done right well he said he came to his own his own received it not but it means he did give you eternal life are you doing that but he knew also that there was a whole group of people called a fifth sealed Jew that would be involved into this thing that one of these days would receive eternal life one of these days would be brought in and you know but you know what by Israel turning down the new birth that Israel turning down adoptions Etc they never received the right of sonship so they will always be servants to the bride the 144 000 is servants is right right come on well then you're going to make Israel to others not to be servants and all they are because there's no way that they can come into sonship unless you can complete your journey if you can come to perfection completion and finish up what was in God's mind then you can see that they're still dependent on whether or not it can be done well I don't know where they won't ever come to change the water if we don't come to a change of a body or somebody somewhere then there's no hopes of nobody else it don't say they're they don't say you're dependent on them right it says they're dependent on you depending on you to achieve achieve the promise that he's given you a promise that was so secretively until it only Parts spoke of in the Old Testament of even types and shadows a little bit like Abraham and say return back to young man the young woman few little things spoke of Paul picks it up in spirit and he says look hold them back there and all of where we are now because remember now Paul at the time he was doing it it was still God dealing with the basics of the Jews right you with me the Gentiles were just coming in so he said something's got to happen and it was going to be changed in a moment a twinkle of an eye that somebody's got to reach a place and once they reach that place the connecting line will be back down through to bring everything else into view you realize then that the connecting line and I didn't bring the quote but let's see if I can remember it brother Joe I guess he's back there yeah nope Joe ain't there okay brother Bob one of you run in uh fall right in line it's in the Rapture message I could get the paragraph in a minute out of my memory but fall right in line and just run it into Rapture message then shoot it on the screen because you're going to see something I hope that we've waited to see what you see even all Redemptive plans you realize now here's my point so everybody with me everybody awaiting a hollering screaming or something do you realize that when Israel turned down yeah pull it off now because you got it pull it off now because I don't want him reading on it you realize that if Israel had not turned down the gospel are you with me you and I wouldn't have a change Paul sums it up by bringing it over into the scriptures and saying they stumbled Romans 11 11. but rather through their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles through the fall of Israel we could accept eternal life the thing they turned down come on you think they without us you bring it all down here you realize when they turned down salvation the Jews there was no hopes of it coming into being come on now think with me don't think well yes it would have been this and it would have been bad no when they turned it down it was left desolate unto them that's what the scripture says since their house has become desolate those that become desolate too and no hope but God wouldn't satisfy I'd believe it he looked down and he used all of his types and his Shadows he used Ruth and Boaz he used those types and shadows and he looked out to her and he says you choose you've rejected it and I know some of you ain't gonna like this wording it's all right you tell me what it is brother random said God deliberately blinded Israel I know a lot of people blind themselves but you're going to have to argue with that quote that God deliberately put his hand over Israel's eyes why because he knew they would not have it and that there was no way to get it into being except he moved to another group of people and all alone he had in his mind Ruth and Boaz and all those types and shadows that they would be a little Gentile bride they would be a little bride because you know what like I said while ago it was used on the death Pentecost he was used in the book of Acts but you know what it's called Gentile that's what it's called the Gentile Kingdom actually started on the death Pentecost because we accepted it right right because the Gentiles accepted it that put Israel in a preserved or whatever we don't call it position that they could not attain unto it then they had turned it down you remember the little woman he called her a dog right she said that's right Master but said the dogs it's a crumbs they fall from the Masters table he looked down at that little woman and he said you got what you asked for and said every word of the world that this gospel goes your name will be spoke of right and remindeth he can't you just see a man and I'm just making it as plain as I can Nora that he's getting ready for a wedding to marry a bunch of people I mean Mary a bride and he sees this beautiful bride and he sees her little helper that's a wash woman dog so he says all right that's my wife we're going to get married but he found Israel to be pregnated to the devil come on he said run around said she was in adultery that's why God couldn't come to Israel he was already sold out into adultery she was already into heathenisms in the thing and he said okay I'll put you away did he he put Israel away he turned around and he says little Gentile dog little horse woman you got to character the nature of the things that I've been looking for so I'll just take you she said I'll take it she would say be it unto me according to Thy Word a little group of people accepted salvation but you know what God didn't throw away Israel he put her away for adultery now then and remember one thing I know the people of this message preach it wrong about that but you remember one thing I want the Bible for it and I want the prophet's message where God ever marries Israel back his wife come on now I got scripture you can do what you want to I know what it says return unto me backslidden Israel as far as I'm married unto thee that is a time frame scripture that was in that day that is not a scripture speaking of the end time because if it does then you've got him marrying a prostitute again and he won't do it Israel will not come back to being bride nowhere even 144 000 that get eternal life here will be servants to the bride and even though Israel will be for the Millennium and they'll have all the promises God gave them that they can take and do and all of that some were chosen like Abraham Isaac and Jacob to sit down at the welcome table which is the marriage supper as guests but he won't take them back his wife because he won't put away a woman and take her back when she's in adultery because he wouldn't put her away the first time if he didn't die Deuteronomy 24 24 I mean 24 if you want to get in the Bible he won't do that he can't return unto a there's nothing to cleanse Israel in the dispensation that we are because they rejected him but when we leave out of here it'll go back to the 144 000. and by going back to the hundred and forty four thousand then Israel will receive the Gospel of the Kingdom and there will be in the millennium and I believe they'll be given eternal life I believe that there'll never be the bride of Christ they rejected it now do you understand why they without us cannot be brought to a completion they without us that have received Christ we are then what's keeping the wrath of God off of Israel the bride of Christ I know it's going around now and I heard it up at Ruth and I note of it before but I'm not saying nothing other than one thing people are saying that the Old Testament Saints were made perfect in the resurrection of Jesus Christ and came forth in glorified bodies and and walked upon the Earth back there with Jesus and thank and you got a lot of quotes they got a lot of quotes but all I ask you to do is just read a little I didn't give it here but they could probably find it by the time we read this other one read around and said one day Adam will reach over and Shake Eve try that one it may be right in the message just Abraham Adam will shake Eve evil Shake Abel and a resurrection will come in the book of Acts it says David septuager our grave is with us till this day surely David would have been one that would have been raised did you get it okay there you go he's taking the message inspiration 1956. the Williamsburg Kentucky I want to know amen as the poet in the song said I can see Adam Shake Eve and say Eve this is it honey he reaches over and shakes Abel and said Abel Abel Shake say it says say it shakes no one nor shakes Abraham look where it's coming amen the time has come know him in the power of his resurrection know that by my inspiration that's been leading me and been classed a fanatic and whatsoever it's what more it brought to me to the line it's brought me to the playing of the price what Those Old Testament Saints they're waiting on you and I why would your Prophet say Adam would reach over and get Eve if they raised back there physically and walked into the city as is taught I don't understand it I'm not saying anybody's wrong or right I'm just saying I don't understand it and you don't want to know I don't understand something obviously I don't understand because that way you can help me all right now go ahead and pull up the one from the Rapture and we'll get that one so you see I wouldn't intending to bring all of this point paragraph 178 one day there will come obliged from Heaven and the dead in Christ shall rise first listen them Old Testament Saints back Yonder who are waiting Will Blast forth and come out of their first and go into the resurrection we'll drop right in line going into the sky these old Mortal bodies changed and made like unto his own glorious body what a parade that'll be the Rapture in time that's all I told you brother when I discussed that with him years ago as brother Branham could put all of that over at one time you say yeah but that's not the that's not the dead in Christ who rise first your Prophet started off with the dead in Christ shall rise for because it is a responsibility to those that are alive for the dead to rise first and then we which arrive and remain shall be changed so what's the word waiting on you and I adoption time let me read the last one then we'll quit go ahead down to number 10 brother taken from the message of the Statue of a perfect man you get it these people who died in dire are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and they're they're under sold under the altar waiting for a church to come to a Perfection then Jesus comes he comes adoption he's waiting on you and I where he can pull in his fullness to raise the dead and we'll go into rapture I'm just saying my point is what connection did we have see when they turned it down we accepted it but what if we hadn't accepted it where would you be today had you not accepted Jesus Christ as your savior number two where would you be the day had you not accepted this message sitting in them churches smoking drinking having a big time shouting Glory Hallelujah and saying the Rapture is coming right I'm honest now that's not thrown off on nobody that's left up to them that's not to me and you I'm not against anybody I prayed earlier today I thought Lord don't let people think I'm against them I'm not I don't care where you agree with me or not I'm not against you you can believe what you want to I don't mean it's writing I'm going to to compromise with you no but I'm not going to do christianize you and send you to hell because you don't believe in what Lula teaches but they without us cannot be made perfect them Old Testament Saints can't come out their bodies can't come out of the ground you say yeah but the Bible says they've already okay that's all right I just asked you one question Jesus had two ascensions read your Bible when he raised from the dead and appeared to Mary don't touch me I'm not yet ascended he went right straight up he come right back stayed for 30 40 days and send it again is that right that's in the book of Acts that's the only thing but I hope you catch one thing by Israel turning it down and by you accepting it that did leave Israel with a hoax that God would not totally annihilate them but he would look at that little bride and he would see that little bride and he'd say this little bride is is what I wanted this was my my goal my achievement but this is my people he came to his own and his own received it this is my people and one day I bring my people come on Joseph was down in Egypt and one day his people came and Pharaoh said Joseph you take the best you put your daddy and your family out there on it it belongs to you they had to be a pharaoh come up that didn't know Joseph before they could start hurting them anyway because he had already decreed this is the hers I guess he might have been a little upset when he found out they were sheep herders because remember Joseph lied to him he said they were catarasers herzmen I guess he was a little upset but he said I can put up with sheep he loved Joseph wouldn't you love a man that had saved your kingdom that had preserved all of your whole land and kept you intact as king well he was second in command right do you understand all of these types and shatters parts that we look at I'm going to say it one more time by them turning it down it would have left it a null to everybody there was no hope that there was a little group of people that would receive it and he says okay I take this because it's what I wanted but I'll preserve the rest of it one day that Millennium is going to be a great thing because that Jews is going to be there as a nation your Prophet said and they're going to have a millennium Temple Ezekiel 40-44 erected on Earth not a temple to offer sacrifices no but a temple to show that you and I can go in there and tell them Jews look you built this yes we built that do you know what that means let's say we really don't know said this is what it means this is speaking of Jesus Christ you remember running around and said them Jews never didn't understand the two loaves because he said he said I didn't understand him too low he said if they'd done it back on these things let's Stand Together sorry to be a little empty this evening but I wanted to get that to a point now maybe next Sunday we'll review some of this and we'll have questions and answers next Sunday morning maybe or something or whatever I could keep preaching on this part but I want to move into another couple of things and you know and in doing that it'll come right out of this and unfold I hope and pray what do we got brother 167 anybody have a need foreign think on these things by their rejection we receive by the rejection of the gentile people in the end time God will turn back to Israel they brought it to us we take it to them with that little ride was in his mind the whole time you think about a God that for 6 000 years planned and moved everything so perfectly till everything was perfect in types and shatters and then he walked right down to make sure the rest of it would come right he done it himself he never sent a son to die he said I'm going myself I want to make sure it's all right right and all taken care of what do we got brother 167 in the red book anybody have a need when things Bill Jesus came and made me oh I wouldn't be back I would not be denied I would not be denied fill Jesus came and made me with asking the nurse we were going to put it on the armband type of thing you don't fix it I reckon that lady knew what she do she got a piece of tape she just takes me practice go away comes from you and we believe you and now remove the pain and the agony in Jesus name was gone anybody else what about it look what an honor the word is done in Christ what a great thing it is to be to be the bride of Christ he put everything right into her all the promises every promise in the book is mine I need to just write my name down say thank you Lord that's mine if mine we lay our hands upon our brother just asking to take care of all the problems the troubles and the heartaches and things that exist there we believe that you'll give him strength and things courage to walk forth in you and believe that all is well in Jesus name anybody else what a wonderful thing you say everything is dependent upon whether or not he was God it's good but he said everything's dependent upon whether you can believe who you are oh these things are possible to God he said all things are possible to them that believe you say you speak I would not hold on a minute you know I've always kind of cut up a little bit maybe I'm wrong I'm sorry a lot of you know what I mean and what I'm saying about it and I've said something to like sister Anna to Sister Trudy and some of these people they speak languages and things and I've asked this question I've always said you know when when you're speaking we say dog all right and you know I said now when you're speaking in your language what do you mean they said well we're being dog I said well why don't you say dog and say what is Spanish petroleum you know it's it's a different wording in every country for dog right but you know everybody means dog right Brother Ray was talking about it now if it's our today that God showed him something about that you know a lot of these things can't be true to a lot of people accuse God of because he has no attributes for that he can't have hate there's he had no attributes it can't be and what I told him was what I was thinking of it's a funny little thing but it means a lot to me you know in languages you've got different words for different things you know this one will but it all means the same Basics right it'll all mean a dog or a horse or a cow you know there's no such thing as a mixed up revelation all Revelation is the same in every language God could speak to a house full of a hundred different languages and every one of them could get a revelation of the same thing so then when we get there we won't have to worry about talking to nobody and trying to get an interpreter his thoughts are perfect and a word is a thought expressed during the day of Pentecost they was right how here we ever man in our own tongue wherein we were born names about eight or nine languages and every one of them understood the one speaker oh smart alec man comes up with the 12 apostles were interpreters it didn't say that he said how here they ever man Revelation had only one voice Lord Jesus we love you just go home with us help us guide us and bless us and keep us forgive our sins most of all lead us in thine understanding help us to see what you're trying to say to each one of us we love you father and just have your way bless each one be with their wife deliver that Lord be with these others brother radar we told him just going back because he's healed we believe it and father we believe that by your stripes we are healed of whatever we have need of it's the finished product and it's the same language around the world by your stripes we are healed we love you Lord and we thank you in Jesus name you dismissed we shall be changed to immortality changed in a twinkling of an eye we shall be changed we
