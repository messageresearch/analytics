[14:12] us so then we send the Holy Spirit guys
[14:15] to these that Lord that are sick and we
[14:19] ask you to just heal each and every one
[14:21] have your way
[14:22] bless us together in your loving grace
[14:24] in Jesus name James 5 and then we'll go
[14:33] to Jeremiah 3 says be patient therefore
[14:39] brethren unto the coming of the Lord now
[14:42] what's this talking about the coming of
[14:45] the Lord well is that simple enough to
[14:49] where we can just read it and as the old
[14:51] saying goes third grade reading that we
[14:55] can read it toward it it says unto the
[14:58] coming of the Lord behold the husbandman
[15:01] which is Almighty God waited for the
[15:05] precious fruit of the earth and hath
[15:07] long patience for it until he received
[15:10] the early and latter rain now that's not
[15:13] you read that now read it but with
[15:16] understanding the husbandmen at Almighty
[15:18] God he's waiting on you and I right he's
[15:24] waiting on you and I he's not waiting on
[15:26] his self
[15:27] it's already finished as far as he's
[15:29] concerned he's waiting on you and I what
[15:32] for how patience until he received the
[15:35] former and latter rain he who the church
[15:37] I the also patient stablish your heart
[15:41] for the coming of the Lord
[15:43] draw it now all right now let's go back
[15:46] to where we were on the other night in
[15:49] there the other day by Sunday and
[15:52] Wednesday whatever to Jeremiah I want to
[15:56] make sure and get this point in where we
[15:58] can see the real truth of the day that
[16:01] we're living Jeremiah 3 verse 2 lift up
[16:07] thine eyes unto the high places and see
[16:09] where thou has not been lain with in the
[16:13] ways has thou set for them as the
[16:17] arabian in the wilderness and thou hast
[16:20] polluted the land with our whoredoms and
[16:23] with our wickedness therefore the
[16:26] showers have been withholding and there
[16:29] has been no latter rain and thou hast a
[16:33] horse for head
[16:34] I refuse us to be ashamed you may be
[16:38] seated will we leave all first for now
[16:42] we've been talking of former and latter
[16:44] rain and we tried to review a lot this
[16:50] past Wednesday and I hope you'll listen
[16:55] to it and try to understand what we're
[16:57] talking about I ask you to listen to
[17:00] what I'm saying I don't ask you to
[17:02] believe what I'm saying I've never asked
[17:05] anyone to believe what I say if my word
[17:08] is not good enough you know and you'd
[17:13] say well I don't believe you within
[17:14] you're doubting my word you're doubting
[17:16] my whole personality my being of what I
[17:19] am and everything and I've never tried
[17:21] to make anybody believe anything my
[17:23] family or anybody
[17:24] I just want to preach the truth you know
[17:28] as much as I know and stay with that and
[17:31] then let you decide what the rest of it
[17:34] is for your own experience because I
[17:36] can't reveal anything to you all right
[17:39] no men
[17:40] mr. can reveal anything to you brother
[17:42] branham couldn't reveal anything to you
[17:44] all right now jesus said even his own
[17:46] life didn't reveal it it's the father
[17:50] that's the revealer of the word all
[17:52] right so then we have to depend upon the
[17:55] Holy Ghost to reveal and make known all
[17:58] right now what was we talking about
[18:01] former and latter rain
[18:03] there's many instances in the Bible like
[18:05] we went through John introducing Jesus
[18:09] see John's message the Lamb of God that
[18:12] takes away the sin of the world was the
[18:14] former rain because it was a planting
[18:17] rain or a ministering or preaching all
[18:20] right and then the Lord Jesus when he
[18:22] stepped out Darcy he was that Lamb of
[18:26] God that takes away the sin of the world
[18:28] he was the latter rain - what John had
[18:30] spoken because he was the production as
[18:34] we'd call it of what John had said in
[18:37] his message well I just always remember
[18:40] that all the way through the Bible and
[18:42] keep it to her that you've got a prophet
[18:45] brings a message
[18:46] all right then there's a people to take
[18:49] that message and make it alive all right
[18:53] then when you make it alive then it is
[18:55] the latter rain - what you're speaking
[18:59] you don't have to just have in our
[19:01] thoughts a long time run maybe former
[19:03] rain back yonder latter rain over here
[19:05] remember it's always anytime you have a
[19:08] sewing rain or the Word of God being
[19:12] planted you're coming into a former rain
[19:15] all right no a teaching rain and then
[19:20] when that is made alive you have the
[19:23] latter rain all right because that's the
[19:26] word made alive in your heart okay see
[19:29] the in the Lord Jesus as I said preached
[19:32] his message dr. Matthew Mark Luke and
[19:35] John that was the former rain all right
[19:40] then when it was quickened on the day of
[19:42] Pentecost to the disciples it became the
[19:45] latter rain are the quickening making
[19:48] alive of that word and there was a
[19:50] harvest
[19:51] of the message that the the Lord Jesus
[19:54] had preached the harvest was there in
[19:58] the book of Acts and you seen them as he
[20:01] come through the end we went through the
[20:03] ages and and all is to try to run a PHY
[20:06] step to a rat then we went through the
[20:09] ages bringing it down to where Paul
[20:12] preached to the first church age and see
[20:15] his message was the former right are the
[20:17] teaching reign you know he brought a
[20:19] message all right then the people became
[20:22] that message okay and that's so is it in
[20:27] each age that a messenger comes to bring
[20:30] the message all right then as the
[20:33] messenger brings the message when God
[20:35] makes that alive or gives understanding
[20:38] opens the word alright to the people and
[20:42] they become that message there is the
[20:45] latter rain are the quickening coming to
[20:50] a harvest rain you know we'd call it
[20:52] because in the you know in the natural
[20:54] we know the story you go out and you
[20:55] plant your garden well you've got to
[20:57] have moisture you got to have former
[20:59] rain to fall on it are poured on
[21:01] yourself all right we see then one day
[21:04] you harvest what is in that field that's
[21:07] brought forth remember my points been
[21:10] trying to get you to see the rain
[21:12] doesn't change the seed the seed is the
[21:16] seed whatever seat it is it just
[21:20] moisturizes that seed to where the seed
[21:23] props forth in life it doesn't change it
[21:26] from a coke over to wheat that doesn't
[21:30] work now I admit we were a bunch of coke
[21:33] averse
[21:34] I admit that now and you know you and I
[21:37] were a bunch of cuckoo birds as far as
[21:39] the gospel is concerned because that's
[21:41] Gentiles we were just heathen you know
[21:43] running around with clubs on her back no
[21:46] promises in the Bible no nothing you
[21:49] know just a bunch of heathen people
[21:51] living in a world that had no rights to
[21:54] God whatsoever but God made a way and
[21:58] thank God for that
[21:59] like I've always said you know we talk
[22:02] about the African people and say well
[22:05] well there're Africans and there's this
[22:07] wife this group will hear that and then
[22:09] we call ourselves Americans and we say
[22:12] we're Caucasian well I say we're a
[22:15] concoction because that makes none of us
[22:17] worth anything it doesn't matter what
[22:20] the color of the skin or whatever it is
[22:21] there's no difference in it you can give
[22:24] me a blood transfusion I can give you
[22:26] one
[22:27] all right that doesn't change anything
[22:29] on that it just brings forth whatever it
[22:32] is so that's the main thing now what is
[22:35] it see then as we come to Feist run-up
[22:37] to Iraq see when brother Branham then
[22:39] came and brought his message we have it
[22:43] in tapes and books we have it on the
[22:45] computers we have it on everything of
[22:47] the message that the Prophet brought all
[22:50] right now that message he brought is a
[22:52] former rain
[22:53] a teaching rain so he went forth and
[22:58] told his message all right now when the
[23:02] people make that message alive then
[23:05] you'll see the latter right all right
[23:08] because that is what's making it alive
[23:10] is the rain that's that's the thing
[23:12] that's taking place and that's what I'm
[23:14] trying to get you to see that maybe
[23:18] we're looking for things that we
[23:20] shouldn't look for all right and then
[23:24] we'll complain or gripe or say well why
[23:27] ain't God among us now I quote the
[23:30] Prophet he said the very spirit you used
[23:35] daily to overcome no we'll just live
[23:39] it's the same holy spirit that was under
[23:43] those foxes Book of Martyrs of all those
[23:45] people dying giving their lives for the
[23:48] gospel it's the same Holy Ghost in every
[23:51] age it's according to the people all
[23:54] right and see if we believe that we're
[23:56] the last day people then there's not
[23:59] another message to come all right it's
[24:04] the final message and the bride becomes
[24:06] as we were bringing the other day what
[24:08] the prophets say under her messenger she
[24:11] will be the final voice
[24:13] to the final age right under her
[24:16] messenger what are you saying by
[24:19] bringing his message or trying to make
[24:21] that message alive you know make it a
[24:24] living message it was never meant to
[24:27] just be coming and condemn organizations
[24:30] that wasn't what the message come for
[24:33] the message come to make the bride alive
[24:36] you know to take us out of here on a
[24:38] rapture in faith lacework in the books
[24:41] and tapes or in other words in the
[24:43] message because what are you looking for
[24:45] who are you looking for something to
[24:46] come alright but now as I said we read
[24:50] here that's even as the point to make
[24:53] sure that we if we don't bring that seed
[24:58] in sighs this for a second if we don't
[25:01] bring that seed pure and unadulterated
[25:05] then God cannot make it alive for what
[25:08] he wants right I mean you know what what
[25:13] are you expecting what are you expecting
[25:16] in this day well we're this where that
[25:19] with is where we're in bad shape like I
[25:22] said the spirits you use daily to
[25:24] overcome is the very holy spirit that
[25:29] fell on the church in the beginning the
[25:31] heels of sick raise the dead it's the
[25:34] same holy spirit all right season why
[25:37] don't we believe it that away and say
[25:40] thank you Lord now bring the message and
[25:42] let us be what we're supposed to be and
[25:44] we read their word the Prophet said
[25:46] after the door the Gentile church is
[25:49] closed he said he would have known a
[25:51] church then and God would do in one year
[25:54] one theology or theologians tried to do
[25:57] in 2000 but said he's doing it now
[25:59] that was the 1954 see anytime you have
[26:05] the word being revealed to you there is
[26:08] your quickening power right all right
[26:13] when the word is made alive that's the
[26:15] quickening power and like I said to
[26:17] ending up the message there Wednesday
[26:19] see when you receive the new birth
[26:23] all right you can't lose that nuber
[26:28] right now I said new birth I didn't say
[26:32] our ideas or make a statement or claim
[26:34] to believe that but we'll get to that in
[26:36] a minute and you look at what's falling
[26:38] apart around the the message people you
[26:41] know all right we'll get to that in a
[26:43] minute in in the message but I want you
[26:44] to get this point see the day you
[26:47] receive that new birth that rapture was
[26:50] put inside of you brother Branham says
[26:53] your resurrection is in your spirit now
[26:57] that's not that that's not in your file
[27:00] sensitive spirit because everybody has
[27:04] that it's in your spirit that's within
[27:07] you that's the Holy Spirit in your soul
[27:10] that's made alive in you all right now
[27:13] God ain't gonna come and take away all
[27:15] of the bride and leave one if you've got
[27:19] Jim if you have the genuine new birth
[27:23] your rats are started that minute one
[27:26] because look what happened to you the
[27:30] Bible says we are resurrected and
[27:35] sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[27:40] Jesus is that right we'll see then your
[27:44] rights are already started right there
[27:46] in your resurrection started there it's
[27:49] just having to wait until the time that
[27:51] it's finishing it up and we've got the
[27:54] form of rain we've got the message the
[27:58] Prophet brought all we got to do is
[28:01] study that message until we become that
[28:03] message all right and brother Branham
[28:07] said it like this now he said it he said
[28:09] if you're truly born again that Holy
[28:12] Spirit is sitting in your soul waiting a
[28:17] lot waiting on you to bring him the word
[28:22] right he's waiting on you to bring him
[28:26] the word that he can make alive back out
[28:28] to you
[28:29] I mean that's the simplicity of it why
[28:32] should we worry about anything else then
[28:35] just rest in him and and be happy you
[28:38] know because that's that's what we're we
[28:41] were promised to do in the last days all
[28:43] right but then we we took over that said
[28:48] James and James is specifically
[28:51] explaining that God is waiting on you
[28:54] and I now brethren says this on the
[28:58] message I think it's adoption
[28:59] he said God's waiting on you and I he
[29:02] said adoption time when he can pour in
[29:04] his spirit his fullness and time into
[29:07] you and I and take us in a rapture you
[29:11] mean God's waiting on us yeah yeah he's
[29:16] waiting on you and me he don't have to
[29:22] but he did promise he would I like that
[29:26] don't you and as he promised that he
[29:29] would come and take us out of this chaos
[29:32] all right then what did the Prophet say
[29:35] only what is it god of this evil age he
[29:39] said the bride is to prove to Satan that
[29:43] she won't fall like Eve did all right
[29:48] this you're simply taking the message
[29:50] then you know I mean I all we gotta do
[29:56] is take the message and when I got one
[29:58] Bible we're gonna get that in a minute
[30:01] worth it over here so I'll split up in
[30:03] mankind until what it's wound up to be
[30:06] but still if there's just one Bible I
[30:09] don't see one that is so many
[30:11] denominations I didn't understand that
[30:13] when I was in the Baptist Church I
[30:14] thought why is there so many different
[30:16] denominations and we've got one Bible
[30:18] we'll see I didn't know nothing about a
[30:20] prophet or anything then I was just
[30:22] serious minded in thinking we've got one
[30:28] message why is there so many splits and
[30:32] all kind of things in the message of the
[30:34] hour that we call now I'll say this one
[30:36] thing to you straight there is no
[30:39] problem with the message
[30:41] the message is right you can put your
[30:45] heart on the message but now a lot of
[30:47] our interpretations we'll get to in a
[30:49] minute that's what's killing us all
[30:52] right we see God is waiting on you and I
[30:57] to step forth as we were talking last
[31:00] night you know in the Bible study of
[31:04] praying and things God is waiting on you
[31:08] and I to call him on the scene and as I
[31:12] covered in the ages and the what did the
[31:15] Prophet say happened in those ages as
[31:17] they come down you know he said when the
[31:21] church got to dying away in that age he
[31:24] said they'd be a group of people begin
[31:26] to call out like the children of Israel
[31:30] begin to call out for deliverance and
[31:32] God sent Moses to them well as they
[31:37] started crying out for deliverance God
[31:40] sent another message to another church
[31:42] age but then we come to the last one and
[31:47] there's not another message passed this
[31:49] one there's not another messenger pass
[31:51] this one all right it's all finished
[31:54] thataway God done what he said and he's
[31:57] waiting on you and I but why have we
[31:59] been now they just cut it short in the
[32:03] point why is it been that God has given
[32:09] us 50 years almost just to going to the
[32:12] Prophet don't you think he's been
[32:15] patient don't you think he's been
[32:19] long-suffering what do you think it
[32:21] demanded 20 years ago 30 years ago 40
[32:26] years ago 50 years ago what if he had
[32:29] demanded it to come forth at that time
[32:34] where would you and I be some of us
[32:37] wouldn't even born again some of us
[32:38] wouldn't even born where would we be but
[32:43] see he's been long patient thank God
[32:47] thank God that he's been patient with us
[32:50] right because I'm sure it's been rough
[32:54] with him you know we talked about that
[32:57] morning getting believer has an angel
[33:00] well I've always told you when I get to
[33:03] her and I see him I'll have to apologize
[33:07] to it because I've kept him busy I don't
[33:11] know where you think like that or not
[33:13] that's the way I think I've kept him
[33:15] busy
[33:15] and I've told about the things and I had
[33:20] a dream one time like I don't know
[33:22] whether I've ever told this one to the
[33:24] point here forgive me for coffee but I
[33:28] had a dream one time and in the dream I
[33:32] saw this angel that was supposed to be
[33:34] my angel and he was talking about you
[33:42] know where we'd come and what would come
[33:43] through or what it happened and I looked
[33:47] at him and I said but were have you been
[33:50] and that's the dream that's a dream but
[33:53] it still and I said where have you been
[33:56] he said I've been with you the whole
[33:58] time you know that's true he had but
[34:04] there's a lot of times I didn't know
[34:06] where he was at right but maybe he was
[34:10] over thy rest in from all the things
[34:13] he'd had to put up with from the few
[34:15] days before that I had got into you know
[34:17] maybe that's the point but just forgive
[34:19] me having to put in a cough drop that's
[34:21] the old age factor and you're getting
[34:25] out with your soul just don't worry
[34:27] about it just pray for us okay but now
[34:31] are you with me about the thought see
[34:36] former and latter rain teaching rain
[34:40] that's what a minister does the minister
[34:44] gets a message from God all right
[34:46] and then he goes forth and speaks at sea
[34:51] that becomes a former Ryan
[34:54] now here's where the troubles are
[34:57] remember if you're Baptist today and
[35:01] preaching you're sowing a seed if you're
[35:04] Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostal or
[35:07] brand of mind okay then you're sowing a
[35:14] seed be careful what kind of seed we
[35:17] plant because it will produce alright he
[35:22] will come up but remember they're having
[35:25] a Foreman ladder run I thought I told
[35:27] you study brother runs message and run
[35:30] it in your computer form in lighter
[35:31] right and listen to him talking about
[35:33] the Baptist having a reformer rain and a
[35:35] lot of rain the Pentecostals and all
[35:37] they had a former rain and had a lot of
[35:40] rain alright and brother branham hotel
[35:43] the Pentecost we're sure you've had a
[35:45] lot of rain within when he got to 62 on
[35:48] the spoken word his original seed he
[35:50] knew something was coming forth that was
[35:54] more than what they had ever thought of
[35:56] so he turns to the Pentecostals in that
[35:59] preaching and he says you say you've had
[36:02] a lot of rain he said nonsense he's
[36:05] because you haven't had the former rain
[36:06] yet in other words they hadn't accepted
[36:09] his message up to that point and he knew
[36:12] that was more to come
[36:15] he knew he was to bring a message with
[36:18] that message as a former Ryan
[36:20] we'd have no excuse we have no excuse
[36:25] now when we first came when I came in
[36:27] the message in 66 C we could 67 right
[36:30] there you know we could get very few
[36:32] books a lot of you was there before even
[36:35] the books and times come along all you
[36:37] had was tapes and dines and and men we
[36:40] used to write our own concordance or
[36:41] some things you know and write things
[36:44] and and to try to keep up with them but
[36:47] think of it today you can't say well I
[36:52] don't have them books
[36:55] there won't be no excuse me to get to
[36:58] the throne and remember there are two
[37:00] judgments
[37:01] one of them's the lights are on the
[37:03] other ones judgment the deeds done in
[37:04] the body whether good or bad so we're
[37:06] gonna agree that one of them
[37:08] and we definitely don't want to be at
[37:10] the white throne and see but we're gonna
[37:12] stand at the other and give an account
[37:13] you say well I didn't have the Bucks
[37:16] brother Dale announced certain certain
[37:18] books on you've got the tapes you've got
[37:22] your computers there is no excuse you
[37:28] can spend hours sitting on the computer
[37:30] why can't you spend hours listening to
[37:33] the Prophet breeze okay now but listen
[37:39] what went wrong now the Lord is waiting
[37:43] on you and I to come to a place but what
[37:48] has went wrong all right we read it
[37:54] there in Jeremiah now we know that's too
[37:56] natural Israel you know all right
[38:01] that's the natural Israel that God was
[38:04] explaining what he was doing for them
[38:07] all right then he told him he said you
[38:14] have a horse for head and said because
[38:18] of that said the rain has been
[38:21] withholding and there has been no latter
[38:24] rain well alright now where are we at
[38:34] yes but brother Dale I don't have a
[38:36] horse for head I'm a born-again
[38:37] Christian that has nothing to do with
[38:41] your brain whether you're born again or
[38:46] not have nothing to do with your brain
[38:49] capacity
[38:52] right yeah but hi I'm born again yeah
[38:57] you're born to get on in your soul
[38:59] you're not born again in your body in
[39:02] your spirit and you said well I don't
[39:05] have no troubles you're just a big liar
[39:07] that's as big as I can put it I'll put
[39:10] it bluntly you're a liar when you say
[39:13] you don't have no trouble there's one
[39:17] thing for certain if you don't have no
[39:18] trouble you certainly ain't serving God
[39:21] yes but brother Dale I thought we
[39:23] wouldn't wait to go get to it this
[39:25] evening on a message where brother
[39:27] Branham was talking about it that you
[39:28] know the flowery bed of the east are the
[39:33] bad times neither one of them called you
[39:34] mentioned last night he was gonna do
[39:35] neither one of them is a sign of God's
[39:38] approval you know whether everything
[39:41] runs good or everything runs back you
[39:44] know you don't never thank God for bad
[39:46] times know many of the afflictions of
[39:56] the righteous which the Lord lead us out
[39:57] of them all how can he put it through a
[40:01] test and try us if he don't laugh Satan
[40:04] to come after Satan went after job after
[40:12] God had turned him loose well you know
[40:16] what why don't you thank God for
[40:19] sometimes for the troubles you're having
[40:21] you might find out that he's on the
[40:23] scene all right yeah but I thought
[40:28] born-again Christians did not on
[40:30] troubled where'd you get that idea
[40:32] it ain't in the Bible and it definitely
[40:35] ain't in the prophets message so now
[40:39] show me where you got that idea I'll
[40:42] show you in a second where you got it
[40:43] you got it from the old horse forehead
[40:45] you got it from the teaching to what was
[40:47] prior the denominational teaching is now
[40:52] all come to the Lord and you won't have
[40:54] no troubles all your worries is over all

[41:12] ought to you said whether your glory in
[41:17] the trip like no I just know it will

[42:06] down like that here's 441 well they just
[42:09] something happened to brother anyhow
[42:11] they just went right on across the road
[42:13] and that car turned over and I never

[42:32] why not
[42:33] am I supposed to be sad but you asked me
[42:38] say how you doing brother Dale I'm doing
[42:41] wonderful you know I'm all wound up with
[42:46] a cold and sniffling and snorting and
[42:48] everything else but you know what I'm
[42:50] wonderful
[42:51] I could be laying in a nurse in a
[42:54] hospital or a nursing home
[42:58] all right kids has already said they got
[43:00] one picked out for him me and nany so
[43:03] you know I guess they're waiting on us
[43:05] to get old enough we might outlive them
[43:08] so we don't worry about that
[43:11] but now listen church you're getting a
[43:13] serious part of it
[43:15] comical a little bit but get you to be
[43:17] serious nee God is waiting on you and I
[43:22] and you know what he's waiting on now
[43:25] here's the point if you're a born-again
[43:27] Christian alright now remember I gave it
[43:32] to you Wednesday night where brother
[43:33] Brendan said it it's only the children
[43:34] of God that God deals with so thank
[43:39] wonderful that your name is called in
[43:41] heaven right no matter how bad it gets
[43:45] thank God
[43:47] praise him for everything that takes
[43:50] place you might find out you'll walk out
[43:52] of your troubles all right no but to the
[43:57] children of Israel they had gotten in
[43:59] bad shape the the background story of
[44:03] what we're talking about and you know
[44:05] they had started as you read verse one
[44:08] you'll find out that they started doing
[44:10] this
[44:10] they were doing bad things you know
[44:12] horrible things why and see God comes on
[44:16] the scene and evidently it must have got
[44:20] it may be a little dry because of the
[44:24] way the situation had evolved as we get
[44:26] on over to verse three and he says
[44:30] because of your horse forehead said the
[44:36] rains are withholding and it's been no
[44:39] lie to Ryan well who was the problem the
[44:47] children of Israel right well who's the
[44:52] problem today you and I good let me nail
[44:58] that down to what we're talking about
[45:00] because that's where people think well
[45:02] I'm a Christian I'm not supposed to have
[45:04] troubles they something wrong with you
[45:06] you need to study the message you need
[45:09] to see what the message has done you
[45:11] know and find out you ought to go ask
[45:13] the Lord Jesus was any troubles in his
[45:15] day you know you might get a good answer
[45:17] out of it right now
[45:19] to the point
[45:23] see what's our troubles why why is it
[45:26] being that we've been here all this time
[45:29] now may I quote the Prophet without you
[45:32] no he says that nothing is out of
[45:38] caterer he said everything is right on
[45:43] time do you need that quote he said
[45:47] nothing's out of cater there's no
[45:50] problems everything's right on time
[45:54] alright so then who's the problem me and
[45:57] you all right now I want you to think
[46:01] with me about this
[46:05] because we mentioned this the other day
[46:08] but just to get to it deuteronomy for we
[46:14] were bringing out the other day a little
[46:16] bit and they don't have this what i just
[46:17] wrote that scripture down you know it
[46:18] says that seven women would come to
[46:21] every man's cocktail you know they'd be
[46:25] more women our men in the world old rock
[46:27] and no said they would say let us be
[46:32] called by thy name to take away our
[46:36] reproach all right and see they wanted
[46:42] to have a mark of having a husband and
[46:45] as i tried to express that to you their
[46:47] point was that you know it used to be
[46:51] that if a girl had a baby out of wedlock
[46:53] who was they was pretty bad
[46:56] it kind ten away no more but that don't
[46:58] change christianity that don't change
[47:01] that it still goes on the side all right
[47:03] but you see what the point is they're
[47:06] saying there let us be called by thy
[47:09] name called we need a name
[47:12] so they wanted to be called Christians
[47:15] ever Church wants to be called
[47:17] Christians right let us be called by a
[47:21] Christian name and I told you didn't it
[47:24] Amaro an amazing thing you ride down the
[47:27] road now and you don't see a new church
[47:29] coming up and it'll say First Baptist
[47:31] Church of May's building that's what it
[47:34] used to be on this island right now what
[47:36] does it say Shiloh or spoken word Church
[47:39] or or any kind of a name that they don't
[47:42] have the name of Baptists are Methodists
[47:44] and things like that anymore they've got
[47:46] their own little names you know Oh what
[47:50] is it what's the one in Gainesville
[47:51] Jennison Franklin the free chapel the
[47:55] not listed as an independent or anything
[47:59] it's a name that name has to do with
[48:02] what they're thinking or doing all right
[48:04] do you think about that people are
[48:07] wanting to be called by Christian names
[48:11] instead of denominational names anymore
[48:14] that order show you that we're at the
[48:16] end of bringing it because and it's not
[48:19] going to do away with those things it's
[48:21] just going to change their the name that
[48:23] they got on the front door all right so
[48:27] let us be called by thy name
[48:30] yeah the church is saying that let us be
[48:34] called by this name that name to take
[48:37] away our reproach we want to be a member
[48:39] of so-and-so you've heard the old saying
[48:41] you've got to belong to something
[48:44] we'll see you don't got to belong to
[48:46] something you got to be born again if
[48:49] you're born again you don't belong to
[48:51] something you are part of it all right
[48:53] now then to come to the basis of sin
[48:57] that he said to them he said you've got
[49:02] a horse forehead now what is a horse
[49:05] forehead plain language for kids but
[49:09] they're old enough they hear it out
[49:10] there they know more about these words
[49:12] than we do right you try to protect your
[49:16] children from hearing bad names and
[49:18] think they know more bad names than you
[49:19] do because they're in school right they
[49:23] don't do no good for me you know bad
[49:25] night I don't like any bad night I don't
[49:27] even like little slang names you know
[49:29] people say things and they'll say a
[49:32] little like a dirty word we call it and
[49:34] they say well I I just can't help it
[49:37] I've been trained all my life say that
[49:39] you don't have to say it like I've
[49:44] always said you take a hammer and hit
[49:46] you fingernail I've seen people do that
[49:49] ever seen somebody get hit or do
[49:50] something wrong and this all these words
[49:52] comes out
[49:55] well you know what would be the best
[49:57] thing to do if you hit your finger now
[49:58] pop it in your mouth and suck on it a
[50:02] little bit it won't hurt it bad words
[50:07] all them cuss words done you any good
[50:09] now kids they sometimes around here this
[50:12] being said sometimes I don't like some
[50:15] of you playing sports and then you're
[50:16] making light of some of these kids that
[50:19] are smaller or doing thing didn't use
[50:20] that use word sometime I don't like it I
[50:23] don't think God likes that you said well
[50:27] it's just a slang word well you don't
[50:30] have to use slang words like I said when
[50:34] you hit your thumb why don't you say
[50:36] praise the Lord
[50:37] if you gotta say something you gotta say
[50:41] something why don't you say praise the
[50:43] Lord could be you could have cut two
[50:45] things slap off but just don't do that
[50:49] I'll just mention that because we you
[50:51] know you're out here playing and
[50:52] listening and kids will make a lot of
[50:54] other kids and say things that are
[50:56] slanderous about it don't say that you
[50:58] know yes that's not the Christian
[51:00] attitude you shouldn't make fun of
[51:01] anybody no matter what cause always
[51:05] remember one thing there was always my
[51:09] point what I look down upon you and say
[51:14] there's always somebody above me it's
[51:20] looking down on me and I don't like for
[51:21] it to be called or say it so don't don't
[51:23] don't do that okay all right now let's
[51:26] get into the message all right and he
[51:30] said you have a horse what is a horse
[51:32] for heat okay you say a Christian don't
[51:37] have a horse for everyone now well how
[51:40] many of you
[51:41] that's just like a point of illustration
[51:43] how many of you were born again before
[51:45] you come into the message and heard the
[51:46] truth all right now you believed in a
[51:52] Trinity and you taught of Trinity and
[51:56] you believed in all kind of eternal
[51:57] hell's and all kind of forms
[52:00] and you claim to be a Christian so your
[52:05] brain has nothing to do your soul in
[52:07] your brain is to our separate parts of
[52:10] you all right so your brain works
[52:16] through your memory reason conscious
[52:18] affections in time which your soul is
[52:21] the controlling factor from the inside
[52:23] all right now so a Christian can have
[52:28] things wrong in their brains that's my
[52:32] point of what saying it while ago
[52:33] getting you to think until truth is
[52:37] preached look where we are right until
[52:45] truth is preached look where we are
[52:47] we're right in the midst of all
[52:49] denominational systems that could be
[52:51] thought of I don't care how much you say
[52:53] you're born again because that
[52:56] born-again experience has nothing to do
[52:58] with your body in your spirit
[53:00] it's your soul that's born again all
[53:03] right so then you know could we be as I
[53:08] said let me be called by thy name
[53:12] let maybe a Christian let me be a
[53:14] Baptist or Methodist Presbyterian or AB
[53:17] randomise let me be called by that name
[53:21] to take away my reproach because it's a
[53:24] shame to not have some kind of a nametag
[53:26] behind you all right but what if that
[53:30] name has the wrong point brother Branham
[53:38] I'll read it to you just a minute he
[53:40] said there's good people in the
[53:41] Methodist the Baptist the Catholics they
[53:45] said I'm not saying they're not good
[53:47] people but they have the thoughts and
[53:52] ideas of that church system so what
[53:57] about us what do we have yeah but I
[54:01] never thought about the bride having a
[54:03] horse for him well what did you think
[54:06] did you think the day you got born again
[54:08] it got rid of everything
[54:11] now he never taught nothing like that
[54:13] and I ain't never heard the Prophet
[54:15] teach nothing like that and they ain't
[54:16] never heard in the Bible that talk like
[54:17] that the new birth is in the soul it is
[54:22] not in your body in your spirit it is in
[54:25] your soul of controlling center factor
[54:27] or if you want to call it spirit because
[54:30] there is quotations from brother Branham
[54:32] spirit as the entervan are so just
[54:34] remember the inner man of you is where
[54:37] the new birth takes place right see I
[54:44] still think wrong don't you oh no
[54:46] brother dude I don't never had no wrong
[54:48] don't you just lied so now the Bible's
[54:51] gets a lot right just as much as against
[54:56] warn us against the other we see you
[54:59] can't keep Satan from coming through and
[55:01] bringing thoughts into your mind
[55:04] but just remember because they come
[55:06] through your mind if you don't entertain
[55:09] that remember you ain't done nothin
[55:12] wrong
[55:13] you can't help Satan coming through and
[55:16] giving you wrong thoughts you can keep
[55:20] from entertaining the thought all right
[55:23] now so everybody got that clear now that
[55:26] we can can move on that when we get to
[55:29] this point in a minute in the scripture
[55:33] see we as Christians are not set aside
[55:40] from the thing brother Brown says the
[55:43] day you get born again he said Satan
[55:46] ain't ever gun he's got that's you why
[55:50] because he's gonna try to break you down
[55:53] he don't have to break down this other
[55:55] guy that's in the juke joints and the
[55:57] liquor joints and you know the they
[56:00] don't have to do that already got him
[56:01] he's after you you say you're a
[56:04] Christian he automatically pulls his gun
[56:07] puts it right into your back and start
[56:10] firing away at you right
[56:14] but just remember as I said it you said
[56:17] well brother Dale how can I stop these
[56:19] talk you can't stop thoughts coming now
[56:23] you don't have to thank wrong no but you
[56:27] can't stop thoughts from coming I had
[56:31] trouble with that was an early Christian
[56:33] in the brother moto he told me he said
[56:36] there's something wrong I said yeah I
[56:37] know it I'm trying to stop them thoughts
[56:40] from coming he said you can't do it he
[56:42] said you go crazy as about trying to do
[56:44] that just leave it alone he said but
[56:48] don't entertain it when it gets there
[56:49] you don't want to mean by entertainment
[56:50] don't mall on it you you get out talking
[56:53] around and I'm just playing you get out
[56:56] talking around sometimes you get some of
[56:58] the brothers and boy they're talking
[57:00] about their old pious life and you can
[57:02] look at their life and they're just they
[57:03] just smiling I used to do this and I
[57:05] used to do that and they just look like
[57:07] they're so thrilled well I'm ashamed of
[57:10] what I done I don't want to talk about
[57:14] what I done if you want to talk about
[57:17] what you done you must enjoy right
[57:22] trying to explain a horse for you just
[57:24] in a natural all right
[57:28] now let's get to the spiritual I mean
[57:32] you know to the to the part that we need
[57:33] to think about do you realize any
[57:37] denominational idea that we have
[57:40] contrary to the Word of God that means
[57:44] you've got a horse forehead are you
[57:46] getting it all right back to my point
[57:51] want to go until it's revealed well you
[57:53] got you know it only the reveal word can
[57:56] take away denominational ideas you won't
[58:02] get rid of them we're talking about it
[58:03] last night
[58:04] they go everywhere all that stuff goes
[58:06] with you you you can't get rid of those
[58:10] things you have to pray out to God for
[58:13] him to deliver you
[58:17] but like I said if you get happy and get
[58:20] tickled about what you used to do maybe
[58:22] you ain't got rid of things yet you
[58:27] might enjoyed it too much
[58:28] come on brother Dale's plane but it's
[58:31] truth all right now think about it what
[58:38] would be messed up in a man's forehead
[58:40] because your forehead is your
[58:41] intelligence the run said it's your
[58:44] conscious isn't done all right it's this
[58:46] plane intelligence you have a front part
[58:49] of your brain a back part of your brain
[58:51] and you really have a conscience
[58:53] subconscious and actually technically
[58:56] you do have a unconscious part of you
[58:59] all right because that's that's what
[59:03] makes everything work kind of like
[59:05] you're when you're asleep you're in an
[59:07] unconscious state and that your heart
[59:09] still beats everything still works you
[59:11] still a breathing you know all right so
[59:13] now remember the Bible said that they
[59:17] had their marks or the on their forehead
[59:21] right we've talked about the mark of the
[59:24] beast and how that we think it stamping
[59:26] right across your forehead 666 well they
[59:28] ain't gonna do that that's not what
[59:30] you're talking about
[59:31] it's when you've got in your forehead
[59:34] when you have the the doctrine of that
[59:39] church system still in your forehead you
[59:43] have that under inaudible brother Dale I
[59:44] I didn't I didn't have no doctrine when
[59:46] I'm back there I'm not like you I was
[59:48] just died well why would you die ran out
[59:52] somewheres else cuz you'd like to be
[59:54] though right so don't play with me with
[59:59] words see it's not that not true we come
[1:00:03] up through those systems because that's
[1:00:04] what we believe to be the truth right I
[1:00:11] can't happen if I quote they brought
[1:00:16] around them make this one said he
[1:00:17] carried a Baptist Bible and converted
[1:00:19] them to a Baptist faith
[1:00:24] what a little bit was and he was a
[1:00:27] prophet but remember a prophet don't
[1:00:31] know everything that prophet has to
[1:00:33] learn like we learn you know all right
[1:00:38] now think about it so then for us to
[1:00:43] have any idea contrary now if I don't
[1:00:47] get anything the message you get this
[1:00:49] point a horse forehead is the fact or
[1:00:53] thoughts that in your thinking abilities
[1:00:55] whatever you want to call them to make
[1:00:58] it and said brother L don't understand
[1:01:00] that it needs me okay you get that right
[1:01:02] but you just remember one thing if we're
[1:01:04] talking about the forehead it's right in
[1:01:07] here right in here is what they call the
[1:01:09] part of your intelligence of the
[1:01:11] forehead
[1:01:12] and then you get into back parts and
[1:01:14] different things but it's your
[1:01:16] intelligence that's why it's not stamped
[1:01:20] 666 on your forehead that'll never be
[1:01:23] done but it's the denominational idea of
[1:01:28] the Trinity right now am i quoting the
[1:01:30] prophet what stepped in your forehead is
[1:01:34] the understanding of the Catholic Church
[1:01:36] about the Trinity well I
[1:01:41] has that been taken away do you know
[1:01:45] that only the revealing of God's Word
[1:01:47] the truth of one God can take that away
[1:01:50] from your intelligence my mother she had
[1:01:56] it she said like that I was born the
[1:01:58] baggage I guess I'll die one well you
[1:02:00] know what I'm not against my mother I
[1:02:03] love her well you know what she probably
[1:02:05] died of Agnes I'm hoping God will give
[1:02:08] her something I'm hoping she was right
[1:02:11] but I don't know you're not talking
[1:02:14] about your mama no I'm not talking about
[1:02:15] mine I'm talking about yours now you can
[1:02:19] get more upset with me cuz it's the
[1:02:22] truth
[1:02:22] right see what's wrong with us that the
[1:02:27] word cannot be revealed to us
[1:02:32] why is it that we have trouble thinking
[1:02:34] about one God after 30 years of studying
[1:02:38] the prophets message because it hasn't
[1:02:41] been revealed it's been revealed maybe
[1:02:45] in part to take away some of the things
[1:02:49] but come on it's still right there if
[1:02:57] you don't think it's right then you go
[1:02:58] do what you you want to well you know go
[1:03:02] back to your old churches and see what
[1:03:03] your dad might do you some good some
[1:03:05] time to walk back into one of those
[1:03:07] churches and see what you got and then
[1:03:09] to realize where you've been broke from
[1:03:11] my help okay now but now listen how can
[1:03:19] God come on the scene and I'm asking a
[1:03:23] serious question think about it how can
[1:03:26] he come on the scene in a latter rain to
[1:03:29] get us ready to go out of here when we
[1:03:33] still got the old denominational ideas
[1:03:35] and doctor see that's where you you
[1:03:41] throw it right back at me I don't know
[1:03:43] how discernment I don't have to have it
[1:03:44] I just know the truth if I sitting out
[1:03:48] there I'd look back at you and I'd say
[1:03:51] it like this well we're brother Dale I'm
[1:03:52] doing the best I can
[1:03:54] what do you want me to do
[1:03:57] I want you to study God's Word I want
[1:04:05] you to study the message and listen the
[1:04:07] tapes and read the books and cuz
[1:04:12] remember only the revealed word will
[1:04:14] drive out the unbelief I don't know how
[1:04:18] no one believes you're a liar I'm sorry
[1:04:21] that's just as blunt as I can be because
[1:04:26] he were people and a human being has got
[1:04:29] unbelief he is a product of unbelief
[1:04:32] his whole makeup is unbelief you know
[1:04:35] all right now listen to the point then
[1:04:41] any idea we have what is
[1:04:45] denominationalism a blessed God I'm not
[1:04:47] a bad this you know well then talk to
[1:04:52] him just a little bit you find out that
[1:04:54] they got the same old doctor him that's
[1:04:57] why I can spot them I come up through
[1:04:58] there you know I spot a Baptist preacher
[1:05:02] in a hurry up the pulpit and him
[1:05:04] preaching away one cuz that's where I
[1:05:05] come from
[1:05:06] I know his mannerism and it's worthy you
[1:05:09] would a Pentecostal if you knew some of
[1:05:11] those times well let's see any idea that
[1:05:21] you have whatsoever I have we have any
[1:05:25] idea that is contrary to the Word of God
[1:05:29] then worse the problem act it's not in
[1:05:33] ER so we're born-again Christian
[1:05:37] it's your intelligence are you're taking
[1:05:40] abilities in science you know and see
[1:05:45] you say something about somebody and
[1:05:47] like brother Branham says only spoke
[1:05:49] originals see he said but they're good
[1:05:50] people
[1:05:53] well brother tell you you're preaching
[1:05:55] against defeating all I appreciate get
[1:05:57] something man run a worse wonderful God
[1:05:59] and the people over guard okay I'm
[1:06:01] preaching in this building I'm preaching
[1:06:04] to what's gonna listen on the tapes and
[1:06:05] whatever I'm not preaching to the that
[1:06:07] I'm preaching the poor supposed to be
[1:06:10] believers in the message trying to get
[1:06:14] us to see what it is well I don't
[1:06:19] brother Brennan was this when I look but
[1:06:21] I think maybe see you've automatically
[1:06:24] done the same thing Eve was doing in the
[1:06:26] garden when she said I think well I
[1:06:31] don't have a right thing no they plain
[1:06:35] enough no sheep have no rights am i
[1:06:41] right
[1:06:42] you need that from the Prophet well I
[1:06:45] got a rub bless car don't think what I
[1:06:46] want to that proves you're lost when you
[1:06:49] have that idea come in there be careful
[1:06:52] with those dollars be careful with it
[1:06:55] while somebody's preaching they may not
[1:06:58] have the discernment to call it out but
[1:07:00] you know God knows what you're thinking
[1:07:05] my brother now I don't know very good
[1:07:06] brother Dale let's see got it what I now
[1:07:09] quote runaround he said your thoughts
[1:07:10] are louder in heaven than your words are
[1:07:13] on earth is that's a quote we're not
[1:07:18] getting by with anything those things
[1:07:20] are gonna be answered for some work
[1:07:25] we're gonna have to give it a calendar
[1:07:27] all right now to get to the point do you
[1:07:32] understand what I'm saying about a any
[1:07:35] any thought that we have whatsoever that
[1:07:41] is contrary to the truth now brother
[1:07:45] Branham did he say it like this and see
[1:07:46] we swore by we swore that there's a
[1:07:48] Trinity and he said that Catholic
[1:07:50] doctrine of baptism father son Holy
[1:07:53] Ghost comes straight out of the pits of
[1:07:54] hell
[1:07:54] you need statements like that they
[1:07:58] certainly was not in the Word of God but
[1:08:01] you know God went to the ignorance until
[1:08:03] truth was brought amen
[1:08:05] all right he winked at it and he's still
[1:08:09] winking today that's why it's 50 years
[1:08:11] he's been blinking his eyes
[1:08:14] waiting on me and you alright but do you
[1:08:18] follow that point that anything any
[1:08:22] thoughts that we have contrary to God's
[1:08:27] Word
[1:08:30] that means that poor forehead is present
[1:08:34] when our thinking and we're just as much
[1:08:38] now listen in that thoughts and ideas
[1:08:41] we're just as much as in a Catholic
[1:08:43] churches would be would be if we went
[1:08:45] back today and sat down in one I know it
[1:08:52] I don't play around but I preached
[1:08:55] pretty hard sometimes than when I do
[1:08:57] have you sit and look at people here
[1:08:59] oh he's against everybody I ain't
[1:09:01] against nobody I'm for everybody I want
[1:09:04] to help everybody I can but truth is
[1:09:07] truth I won't tell you the truth then
[1:09:11] you can do what you want to about it
[1:09:12] okay now let's go over to where we've
[1:09:16] picked up a little bit in the message
[1:09:20] back there and let's go over to Joel
[1:09:24] don't want you to leave this is right
[1:09:27] I'll have to check I done got away from
[1:09:31] my notes anyways and I ain't worried
[1:09:32] about that part
[1:09:33] all right let's go to Joel or two
[1:09:41] I may have to find my own yeah Joel
[1:09:45] three all right now where do they have
[1:09:48] this to bring it up or not
[1:09:50] I don't know then Joel three look what
[1:09:55] it says I want to try to give them a
[1:09:59] minute to pull that up code I want them
[1:10:01] to see it so if you can brother Joe ever
[1:10:03] who's there
[1:10:03] okay you got it in Joel three okay run
[1:10:07] over to verse 12 13 yeah now I want you
[1:10:12] to think about it it says put in you put
[1:10:17] you in the sickle for the harvest is
[1:10:20] ripe come you down for the presses fool
[1:10:23] but that's overflow for their wickedness
[1:10:26] is great now but look at that next
[1:10:31] scripture that scripture has always
[1:10:33] stuck with me look what it says
[1:10:37] multitudes multitudes in the valley of
[1:10:42] decision for the day of the Lord is near
[1:10:47] in the valley of decision multitudes
[1:10:53] multitudes in the valley of decision you
[1:10:58] realize what that's saying well that's
[1:11:02] to Israel okay what is to Israel isn't
[1:11:06] it spiritual to you and I all right
[1:11:11] let's go back a few years and in time
[1:11:14] and let's think about sometimes coming
[1:11:17] down sure when we came into the message
[1:11:19] in 67 started reading a little bit 66
[1:11:23] and picked up in 67 to walk out of the
[1:11:25] Baptist Church
[1:11:28] at that time there was a lot of
[1:11:30] doctrines begin to be started from the
[1:11:33] 67 68 69 70 s you started getting a lot
[1:11:38] of doctrines in the message that split
[1:11:40] up the message to souls to Lords
[1:11:48] borussia as we're talking about life not
[1:11:50] which is correct way to say it is Parsi
[1:11:52] uh-oh no Holy Ghost in this day like it
[1:11:57] was in the book of Acts
[1:11:59] Jesus will that that with life's wonder
[1:12:02] so let's hold that there's back in the
[1:12:04] 70s in the 70s they were bringing it out
[1:12:08] so we had ministers meetings on this
[1:12:11] they were talking about the wrong dates
[1:12:15] of brother Branham hunting out in
[1:12:17] Arizona we had ministers meetings back
[1:12:22] in the seventies on that that's not a
[1:12:23] new thing it just popped up because I've
[1:12:26] always made my emphasis the reason it
[1:12:28] did and it'll show you it goes back to
[1:12:31] that old horse forehead or idea Cosi
[1:12:36] back tire you had a lot of old people
[1:12:40] that had followed the prophets message
[1:12:42] stayed with it and believed it a lot of
[1:12:45] those doctrines were not able to make an
[1:12:48] inroad into the people right see because
[1:12:54] of the people that were old enough and
[1:12:56] it stayed with the message born-again
[1:12:58] believers that fought it out so we had
[1:13:01] ministers meetings about that because I
[1:13:04] told them then I said you don't even
[1:13:05] know what your own laws change I said
[1:13:08] I'm a deer hunter I said you know they
[1:13:11] change in states and you could have read
[1:13:13] around them here at this date and here
[1:13:15] at another date I said don't matter but
[1:13:17] I said the main thing it don't matter to
[1:13:18] me and I said because what I'm telling
[1:13:21] you on is that we if you doubt brother
[1:13:24] Branham Lester being their dates and
[1:13:27] I'll forget that but if you doubt he was
[1:13:30] there then you're doubting whether the
[1:13:33] seals were broke
[1:13:34] because out dars where he met the angels
[1:13:36] of the Lord to come back to Jefferson
[1:13:37] field to preach I said you realize that
[1:13:40] your your
[1:13:41] denying the prophets message well I
[1:13:46] meant that then I mean it obviously you
[1:13:48] had a lot of old people and they
[1:13:49] wouldn't accept that with Endicott now
[1:13:54] after about 20 years after the Prophet
[1:13:58] going you know that you started back
[1:14:02] with a lot of them doctrines under
[1:14:04] different names and ideas instead of two
[1:14:07] souls it was called chains of the soul
[1:14:11] they taught us that Jesus came
[1:14:15] physically out there in 63 and
[1:14:19] Redemption was over right that was the
[1:14:24] first doctrine that would hit me hard in
[1:14:25] this message was redemption is over well
[1:14:28] I had read enough till I said according
[1:14:32] to my Bible and my prophet Redemption
[1:14:35] was over before the world ever begun
[1:14:38] listen what are you talking about well
[1:14:41] ain't nobody to be saved after 63 I mean
[1:14:43] they literally say your kids can't even
[1:14:46] be say well what about my Luke they
[1:14:48] can't be saved cause the prophecy said
[1:14:51] if the Lord don't come my point you
[1:14:57] started doctrines trying to pull them in
[1:14:59] over the two souls the two Lords of
[1:15:01] peru's is the know Holy Ghost doctrines
[1:15:04] and all those things begin to be
[1:15:07] prevalent even in my life by time of
[1:15:10] being in the message
[1:15:14] and I believe then things was wrong I've
[1:15:17] went public from here took each doctrine
[1:15:21] of the two souls to Lords approves this
[1:15:23] son of man to all of that I took it and
[1:15:26] talked to church the truth of what I
[1:15:28] believe about it I believe every
[1:15:30] passenger order do that he ought to
[1:15:32] teach his church people what he you know
[1:15:35] what he believes about it then they can
[1:15:37] make a choice now tried to do that but
[1:15:41] it see we didn't now you've got it to
[1:15:45] word that you've got preachers in this
[1:15:47] message that's been preached in 30 years
[1:15:49] or 40 years and a lot of the preachers
[1:15:53] is the preachers that brought you into
[1:15:55] the message right lot of the preachers
[1:16:01] and puts the ones that was used to bring
[1:16:03] you into the message and where are they
[1:16:06] today more now they're not just saying
[1:16:12] this out of the other they're lambasting
[1:16:15] brother around them to every degrees
[1:16:19] all you got to do now cuz that's what
[1:16:22] makes it a shame you try to introduce
[1:16:24] somebody the message and they say who
[1:16:25] you follow so well okay I'll follow
[1:16:27] william branham turn on the computer and
[1:16:29] run in william branham and i always say
[1:16:31] this the first thing you get is gonna be
[1:16:33] wrong doctrine well boy ain't that
[1:16:35] something that you can't even click in
[1:16:38] the gods generals was the first book i
[1:16:41] got a hold up in this message was by
[1:16:44] someone else talking about no and out of
[1:16:47] god's generals that man never attacked
[1:16:50] the one women preachers whatever get the
[1:16:53] book and read it I've got it viewing it
[1:16:55] but even back being the first thing he
[1:16:58] done was attacked brother Branham and
[1:17:01] said he should have stayed with the
[1:17:03] gifts and the things they put him in
[1:17:06] there as one of God's generals but they
[1:17:08] attacked his message and thoughts and
[1:17:10] doings and they couldn't attach his life
[1:17:13] they even stated said he was a poor man
[1:17:16] and stag poor what are they doing now
[1:17:22] are you getting multitudes in the valley
[1:17:25] of decision at the time of the coming of
[1:17:28] the Lord until you don't know what to
[1:17:33] follow now you turn on somebody and you
[1:17:36] listen to them you don't know whether
[1:17:37] you don't know what they're saying place
[1:17:40] one brother dick actually brother dick
[1:17:42] hands me what that brother believe about
[1:17:44] something one time and I throw I said I
[1:17:46] don't know I said I've known the man a
[1:17:48] long time I still don't know one time
[1:17:51] he'll say I'm gonna get a new body next
[1:17:53] time he'll say it's this body retained
[1:17:56] well I don't know what he's talking
[1:17:58] about cuz he's twisting in the tongue
[1:18:00] I'm just serious
[1:18:03] there's multitudes now see they ain't
[1:18:06] like the old days or where we just had
[1:18:07] this doctor than that doctor in the
[1:18:09] fight now they've got the computers to
[1:18:12] run and do the things and look at the
[1:18:17] poor people falling you know and the
[1:18:22] lefty says well what can I do well
[1:18:27] that's true I mean it's really true
[1:18:31] what can you do especially older people
[1:18:35] that are up in their age you know and
[1:18:38] can't afford to drive 100 miles to go to
[1:18:40] a church or are not able to drive that
[1:18:43] far because of their age what are they
[1:18:45] gonna do they're under the mercies of
[1:18:48] God to the basis that that you know
[1:18:52] listening to those preachers preach Tara
[1:18:57] turn on what is it on the computer now
[1:19:00] catch the one or wasn't on it believe
[1:19:04] the stuff started out by man as believe
[1:19:08] the son believe everything brother
[1:19:11] Branham said inside that's where he
[1:19:13] started go now and do it I looked at it
[1:19:16] ain't going to I just asked other people
[1:19:19] sometimes see what his owner
[1:19:22] but now they're just multitudes
[1:19:26] multitudes in the valley of decision
[1:19:35] that's why the rain has been withholding
[1:19:39] you're in the valley of decision
[1:19:41] decisions is in your brain sure we back
[1:19:44] where we started
[1:19:46] what is your intelligence in your brain
[1:19:49] are we back to that point I brought the
[1:19:51] first about what we're thinking is a
[1:19:54] horse for head because we've got some
[1:19:56] denominational idea it's always been
[1:20:01] kind of funny to me and I'm sorry I know
[1:20:02] I'm just human but how could they
[1:20:04] convert you what are they preaching now
[1:20:09] and I ain't gonna look up to see and I
[1:20:11] don't care but what are they preaching
[1:20:14] brother Branham was wrong well who's
[1:20:15] right now you know my philosophies you
[1:20:23] can call it anything you won't true but
[1:20:25] listen to see if it's right they're
[1:20:27] claiming they've got the truth why are
[1:20:32] they saying the Prophet was wrong if
[1:20:34] they're not claiming they've got the
[1:20:36] truth well I've never hurt brother
[1:20:38] so-and-so I heard him
[1:20:39] oh yeah that's not sitting here I say
[1:20:42] something in your mind goes and you're
[1:20:44] out there somewhere in the law world and
[1:20:46] I come back and the next day I didn't
[1:20:48] hear you say that well let's get the
[1:20:53] tape put listen church do you understand
[1:21:00] what I'm saying
[1:21:01] multitude today that scripture is coming
[1:21:03] alive we look at the scriptures when the
[1:21:06] towers fall follow you know the Lord's
[1:21:09] coming when are the towers fell up you
[1:21:11] under shot down see
[1:21:15] all of those things is in the Bible a
[1:21:19] lot of literal things look around the
[1:21:23] world it's not the denomination that's
[1:21:27] giving us any trouble and I said this 50
[1:21:29] years ago I said it'll never be the
[1:21:32] outside world come after us it'll be
[1:21:35] somebody from the inside they'll come
[1:21:41] from the inside to try to turn it down
[1:21:43] then you look at them and see what
[1:21:46] they're doing so then that scripture is
[1:21:49] right for the hour that we're living
[1:21:50] multitudes in the valley of decision
[1:21:52] what is it they can't make up their mind
[1:21:58] what's right can't make up their mind
[1:22:03] what's right well because of the way
[1:22:06] they're talked they're taught of fear
[1:22:11] you say don't know that I know they're
[1:22:16] taught of fear tactics the fear tactics
[1:22:21] has never worked with me well because I
[1:22:24] guess I've just never been afraid
[1:22:26] because I try to believe what the word
[1:22:27] says now where I'm afraid hat is afraid
[1:22:31] that we could be letting something slip
[1:22:33] by not putting it in and knowing and
[1:22:35] doing it right I'm human I'm a pastor
[1:22:39] okay a valley of decision
[1:22:49] you don't think like that look at all of
[1:22:53] these things that is went wrong I was
[1:22:56] expressing it to a brother this recently
[1:22:58] we let's see what that scripture saying
[1:23:00] about um there must be a fall in a way
[1:23:07] right the Bible speak of that that there
[1:23:11] must be a fall in a way all right
[1:23:14] can't you see that it's falling away now
[1:23:16] remember you can't fall off of a house
[1:23:19] until you get up on top of it is that
[1:23:23] plain and did the kids even get that you
[1:23:27] you don't fall off of the house standing
[1:23:29] out in the front yard you've got to get
[1:23:32] on the house so look where they've come
[1:23:35] they've got up so close until they
[1:23:38] preach this message ministers preached
[1:23:40] it for 30 40 50 years or something
[1:23:42] preach this message there must be a
[1:23:48] falling away so they had to get to the
[1:23:50] truth and now they're falling away well
[1:23:53] what about me and you
[1:23:54] Oh remember I ain't over in that church
[1:23:59] and I end up in New York night and
[1:24:01] Chicago night know if anybody's
[1:24:03] listening that's their business it's not
[1:24:05] mine but I'm just plain to tell this
[1:24:09] church what it is we could be right in
[1:24:12] the midst of that multitude in the
[1:24:15] valley of decision can't quite make up
[1:24:17] your mind
[1:24:20] make up your mind watch me and say it I
[1:24:22] just don't know whether that's true or
[1:24:24] not well come and show me I never had no
[1:24:32] problem
[1:24:33] you differ with me about some come and
[1:24:35] show me now I can put the Bible with if
[1:24:40] you like it you know if you say that I'm
[1:24:42] wrong
[1:24:43] you're duty-bound to come tell me
[1:24:46] and that's what the Prophet said you
[1:24:50] duty-bound to come and tell me where I'm
[1:24:51] wrong but like I've always said now
[1:24:54] don't come and tell me brother there I
[1:24:55] don't agree with you where am I wrong I
[1:24:59] don't know but I just don't agree with
[1:25:01] you well what do you know you know
[1:25:07] enough to leave or do something
[1:25:11] it's just excuses
[1:25:15] it's horse for head yeah well I got it
[1:25:20] right believe I don't believe show me
[1:25:21] that no Bible shows the prophets message
[1:25:25] well we got to believe what you blen out
[1:25:27] you got believe what the Prophet said
[1:25:31] now if I read what he says then I don't
[1:25:34] have no problem if you didn't read it
[1:25:38] out bring it and I'll read it you say I
[1:25:43] got a quote with you bring it cuz I'm
[1:25:45] firm I've always told you I don't care
[1:25:47] how far it looks like something's going
[1:25:48] to the left and to the right you know
[1:25:50] what I mean what brother branham
[1:25:51] sometimes he'll say something look like
[1:25:52] he'd go that away and then he'll say
[1:25:54] later and look like it goes out of way I
[1:25:55] don't care how far it gets he was the
[1:25:58] Prophet and if you'll take them things
[1:26:02] and hold on to them long enough and
[1:26:04] study them you'll see them just start
[1:26:06] coming together and then you'll find out
[1:26:08] he could say it no other way
[1:26:10] than what he said like I've always said
[1:26:15] to you here's the way I stand all right
[1:26:17] come on musician this is where I stand
[1:26:22] brother branham said you say what I say
[1:26:25] he said because I'm responsible now is
[1:26:28] that a quote he said I'm responsible so
[1:26:31] you say what I say you realize that
[1:26:33] somebody could be listening to the
[1:26:35] message saying as far as they got up was
[1:26:36] listening to statue a perfect man or a
[1:26:40] spoken word regional seeds say 62s in
[1:26:43] there you realize if they never heard
[1:26:44] any more truth
[1:26:46] they could preach that the white horse
[1:26:49] rider is the Holy Ghost and God wouldn't
[1:26:54] condemn him now come on he's got to give
[1:27:00] you something to be judged by now if you
[1:27:04] heard the truth then you're responsible
[1:27:06] but that's why the prophets he said I'm
[1:27:09] responsible say what I say and you
[1:27:12] realize now this is my way of saying it
[1:27:14] there was nobody now am I correct on
[1:27:18] this there's a prophet stand before
[1:27:20] nobody he stands before God along is
[1:27:22] that right all right see then when he
[1:27:25] brought the truth it became mandatory
[1:27:28] that you and I believe the truth
[1:27:30] now I quote what I did the other day
[1:27:32] brought around him about 1958-59 said
[1:27:35] the Baptist had just now become a
[1:27:36] denomination well my lord day was the
[1:27:38] denomination the way over a hundred
[1:27:40] years before then had the Baptist right
[1:27:42] up and everything what was he saying
[1:27:44] he's saying they turned down his message
[1:27:48] when he come and brought the message it
[1:27:51] was the condemnation not to just a
[1:27:53] Pentecostal but to ever denomination in
[1:27:55] the world
[1:27:58] because when he brought the truth they
[1:28:00] were commanded to come to the truth well
[1:28:03] maybe they didn't hear it okay Godwin
[1:28:05] sacredness but how many of them has ever
[1:28:08] turned the radio on and heard one
[1:28:10] message all the types you get what I'm
[1:28:16] talking about multitudes are in the
[1:28:17] valley of decision they don't know what
[1:28:19] to believe you ask them well I really
[1:28:23] don't know
[1:28:24] that's what gets me you know say well
[1:28:27] brother you know you leaving the church
[1:28:31] I had a couple of incidents and I said
[1:28:34] tell me where I'm off the word just show
[1:28:39] me where I'm off the word they wouldn't
[1:28:45] show me they wouldn't say a word but you
[1:28:47] know what when they left and went away
[1:28:48] now they're talking about how bad I was
[1:28:51] and where I was off well no that's not
[1:28:56] even right to be sensible as human
[1:28:58] beings if I ask you a question your
[1:29:01] answer my question brother though I
[1:29:03] don't agree with you well how come you
[1:29:06] don't worry I don't know why I don't
[1:29:07] agree with you but I just don't agree
[1:29:09] with you now that's a good answer
[1:29:13] I'd like to sell you some stock in
[1:29:16] Alcatraz if you got that worked up with
[1:29:18] a mind you said what Alcatraz don't
[1:29:20] exist no more that's what I'm saying
[1:29:22] that's how bad it looks Church I'm just
[1:29:26] trying to get you to see one time we're
[1:29:30] gonna face God forever word that has
[1:29:32] been made known to us
[1:29:39] and why has he been 50 years multitudes
[1:29:44] multitudes are in the valley of decision
[1:29:46] they had to be a falling away the people
[1:29:50] of the message had to come to the
[1:29:51] message and now they're falling away why
[1:29:56] because they got the horse 4head well I
[1:30:00] don't believe the Catholic Way well what
[1:30:02] is that like I said well ago you know I
[1:30:04] mean wouldn't it be made of something
[1:30:06] and somebody come along say brother day

[1:30:25] Trinity to me but I didn't believe it

[1:30:30] oneness than anything cuz I literally
[1:30:34] believed you did Jesus couldn't stop he
[1:30:36] stole and bleed that's the way I
[1:30:40] believed in one God then I found out
