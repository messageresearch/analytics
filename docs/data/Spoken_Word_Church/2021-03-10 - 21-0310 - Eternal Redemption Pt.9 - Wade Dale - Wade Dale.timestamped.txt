[2:13] a day makes we uh
[2:15] on thursday you know we announced we
[2:17] were going to brother jewels
[2:19] sunday to preach and he called and said
[2:22] he's going to have to have a procedure
[2:23] done
[2:24] on wednesday so he had the quarantine he
[2:26] couldn't see one person but his wife
[2:28] until from sunday or saturday till
[2:30] wednesday so he called me and canceled
[2:32] so we were coming to church here then
[2:34] saturday about two o'clock when i got
[2:36] off of work brother tim calhoun called
[2:37] he said we're having a special meeting
[2:39] and the preacher can't get here can you
[2:40] come
[2:41] so um a preacher in indiana was going to
[2:44] do the two services on saturday night
[2:46] and sunday it was an anniversary service
[2:48] for his church and someone in his uh
[2:51] congregation passed away suddenly so we
[2:52] had to turn around go back to indiana
[2:55] so we flew flew we we drove
[2:58] up there and didn't get there in time
[3:00] for saturday night but we got there
[3:02] time for sunday so we just went on over
[3:04] to illinois and got our work done but
[3:06] we're still going to brother heights
[3:07] this weekend because we already promised
[3:08] him we're coming
[3:10] so we're going up there and i guess
[3:12] brother they'll be doing both services
[3:13] this sunday
[3:14] brother aaron what you decide
[3:18] you you make that schedule brother aaron
[3:22] will be preaching wednesday though
[3:23] i like this new calendar he writes down
[3:25] what he wants and i just read it off
[3:27] brother aaron will be preaching
[3:30] wednesday
[3:33] hey okay well somebody we can get in
[3:34] touch with him and brother trevor eamons
[3:36] will be with us the next weekend on
[3:38] march the 21st also remember the time
[3:42] changes again like taran said
[3:43] spring forward saturday night and
[3:47] hopefully they'll get that bill passed
[3:50] in the
[3:51] georgia house legislature so we won't
[3:53] have to ever change our clocks again
[3:56] yeah you ain't kidding i don't like that
[3:58] changing back and forth
[3:59] times and all that and then some observe
[4:02] it and some don't
[4:03] indiana never changes there so when you
[4:05] go there you don't
[4:06] arizona never changes there so you don't
[4:08] when you go there you don't know where
[4:09] you're one hour two hour three hours
[4:11] behind so
[4:12] or forward so i'll be glad when time
[4:15] will be no longer
[4:17] and we won't have to watch there won't
[4:18] be no watches in glory
[4:21] thank you lord but um keep those things
[4:24] in your heart and your prayer remember
[4:25] june
[4:26] 17th through that weekend will be the
[4:29] father's day
[4:30] trip and also will be time for the
[4:33] sisters to go to
[4:34] pigeon forge so just keep that in your
[4:37] heart and your mind just remember each
[4:38] one of these and remember the ones that
[4:39] are sick
[4:40] like i said before we got plenty to pray
[4:42] for
[4:44] and uh and the uh the devil's on the
[4:47] rampage but you know what god wins every
[4:49] time
[4:49] amen god wins every time i already won i
[4:52] was thinking today uh
[4:53] i heard brother branham you know he says
[4:56] it two or three times he said you know
[4:58] if if jesus was standing here in a suit
[5:00] of clothes today
[5:01] he said he can't heal you he said all
[5:04] he's going to do is tell you i've
[5:06] already done it
[5:08] so why don't we take that analogy and
[5:10] put it to our heart and say hey
[5:13] it's already finished everybody's
[5:15] wanting a light and a cloud and a
[5:18] you know a feeling and an emotion
[5:21] i just want jesus to whisper in my ear
[5:24] remember what i've already said
[5:26] it is finished it's done it's done amen
[5:30] so if we'll take that that's how we're
[5:31] going to take a body change
[5:32] brother louise we're talking about uh
[5:34] sunday morning
[5:35] to take a body change it's not going to
[5:36] be we're not going to have to get big
[5:38] muscles and we're not going to have to
[5:39] run a marathon
[5:41] uh-uh it's just believing what god's
[5:42] already said amen
[5:44] and by the holy ghost that's what we're
[5:46] going to do amen that's what it was sent
[5:48] for
[5:49] was to give us what strength to give us
[5:51] the ability to get out of here
[5:52] if you don't have it you won't get out
[5:54] of here simple as that
[5:56] all right so let's go to hebrews 9 11
[5:58] and continue on eternal redemption
[6:01] we spoke part of this at brother kim
[6:02] sunday and
[6:04] really had a real good time people are
[6:07] real precious up there really nice
[6:08] people
[6:10] and uh brother tim says tell all of you
[6:13] hello
[6:15] and god bless you so hebrews 9 11 we'll
[6:18] read that scripture again
[6:20] before we get started we'll try to get
[6:21] through the fourth dimension into the
[6:23] fifth dimension
[6:25] and i want you to understand something
[6:28] when when bob was speaking sunday
[6:30] afternoon we were listening to it coming
[6:31] down the road
[6:34] coming back home sunday and you know
[6:38] you can preach all your life
[6:42] and you can know the message
[6:46] paul says unless you have charity
[6:49] he said you can even know the mysteries
[6:51] now that's kind of mysterious that you
[6:52] can know the mysteries
[6:54] and not have the holy ghost because
[6:56] that's what he's talking about right
[6:58] exactly but if you'll get the holy ghost
[7:01] that means the mysteries become more
[7:03] plain
[7:04] and the mystery becomes history because
[7:07] the one that the mystery
[7:08] is talking about is you christ
[7:12] in you not somewhere else not in a book
[7:15] not on a tape
[7:16] in you the hope of glory amen so hebrews
[7:19] 9
[7:20] verse 11 let's pray before we get
[7:22] started dear lord thank you for this
[7:24] evening that you've given us to come out
[7:26] lord we
[7:28] stand here lord as as one that's
[7:32] totally insufficient
[7:37] we as human beings make so many mistakes
[7:39] every day
[7:41] our thoughts and ideas get in our way
[7:43] lord but i pray
[7:44] just for a little while lord i was
[7:47] thinking the other day you know the
[7:50] as you were watching over your children
[7:51] of israel
[7:53] you told them they're in deuteronomy in
[7:55] different places of what to do what to
[7:56] put on what to wear
[7:58] the clothes and the blood and all the
[8:01] things you
[8:02] they had to do but when they walked in
[8:04] behind that holy of holies it was
[8:05] aaron it was the high priest and you
[8:08] lord
[8:10] but they had made you had made a way for
[8:13] them to get in there
[8:15] and if everything was right then you
[8:16] accepted the sacrifice well lord
[8:18] we know that that veil was rent at
[8:20] calvary
[8:21] we know that we're now all high priests
[8:24] that we can all come boldly to the
[8:26] throne of grace lord
[8:27] and give that petition as we just said
[8:30] that by your stripes we're already
[8:32] healed
[8:33] by your stripes lord everything that you
[8:35] took it all at calvary and took it to
[8:37] your bosom
[8:39] and you destroyed death but lord that's
[8:41] been 2
[8:42] 000 years ago and we just got to start
[8:44] believing
[8:45] that that's already done and not that
[8:47] you have to come and do it again
[8:49] father we pray that you would anoint the
[8:50] word lord anoint the hearers and
[8:52] especially north the speaker lord speak
[8:54] the words you would have
[8:55] to speak lord and they will become true
[8:58] father we know we got plenty around here
[9:00] that sick
[9:02] maybe not sick as envirosic but lord
[9:05] many things satan is really trying to
[9:06] destroy our bodies because that's really
[9:08] the only thing he can get to
[9:10] but lord you said there was a protection
[9:12] for that
[9:14] you said you've already took those
[9:15] stripes you've already took
[9:17] every disease the prophet of god tells
[9:19] us every disease
[9:20] was destroyed at calvary lord we just
[9:23] got to be able to realize it lord
[9:25] well let us realize it tonight father
[9:27] and let us go on today as
[9:29] christians better people better
[9:31] christians in this world that's dying
[9:33] and don't know what to do and
[9:36] lord they don't have a god they have
[9:39] many gods but we have one true and
[9:41] living god
[9:43] and jesus christ is your name father we
[9:45] know who you are we know who
[9:46] where you reside and we know what you've
[9:48] said now i pray that you would put all
[9:50] that together for us
[9:52] drive away the evil spirits and the
[9:53] things that are trying to
[9:55] hinder us from hearing from you father
[9:57] just bless us now and take care of us in
[9:59] jesus name we pray
[10:01] amen hebrews 9 11 but christ being
[10:04] coming high priests of good things to
[10:06] come by a greater and
[10:07] more perfect tabernacle not made with
[10:10] hands that is the same not of this
[10:12] building
[10:13] neither by the blood of bulls and of
[10:15] goats
[10:16] of goats and calves i try to say that
[10:18] other scripture but by his own blood he
[10:20] entered in what
[10:20] once once into the holy place
[10:25] having obtained eternal redemption
[10:29] for us you may be seated now that word
[10:31] eternal
[10:32] means a lot because it's eternal
[10:34] redemption he's always going to be
[10:35] walking around in eternity
[10:37] now we're not going to need listen when
[10:39] we get over there i want you to
[10:40] understand this this is why
[10:42] i want you to see what we're talking
[10:43] about because once we get over there
[10:46] it's not like we're going to need to go
[10:48] into the holy of holies every time and
[10:49] we don't have to even do that now
[10:52] we don't have to come boldly to the
[10:54] throne of grace when we get into the new
[10:56] city
[10:56] we are the grace we don't have to
[11:00] beg forgiveness that's going to be hard
[11:02] for humans to see because
[11:04] you and i are built on i was thinking
[11:06] about this the other day you and i are
[11:08] built on believing what somebody's done
[11:11] that we have not seen
[11:12] who he is but when we get to that future
[11:15] home
[11:16] we're going to see the man
[11:19] that took my sin we're going to sit and
[11:21] we'll be with him for how long for an
[11:23] eternity
[11:25] and every time he raises his hands and
[11:27] every time he shakes your hand or every
[11:28] time he walks up to you
[11:30] you're going to see the nail scars
[11:32] you're going to see the prince in his
[11:33] hand and you're going to see the prince
[11:35] in his feet
[11:36] and you know what you may not remember
[11:37] all the things that happened
[11:39] while you were here but i'll promise you
[11:40] you're going to remember that right
[11:42] and you're going to remember that that
[11:43] man that m-a-n
[11:45] came down here to take on a body to be
[11:49] marred and scarred so that you and i can
[11:51] go to glory and not have a scarred body
[11:54] if you have an operation today if you've
[11:57] had an operation today
[11:58] you won't have a scar over there
[12:02] your bone's not gonna have a crack in it
[12:05] your teeth are not gonna halfway be out
[12:07] your head right
[12:10] praise god but we don't father we can't
[12:14] fathom that though bob we just can't
[12:16] fathom
[12:17] that we're going to a place where we
[12:19] don't have to worry about time tomorrow
[12:22] don't even have to worry about tomorrow
[12:24] because there is no tomorrow
[12:25] we don't have to worry about what we've
[12:27] done did we sin yesterday lord did we
[12:30] make you unhappy
[12:31] that's all gone folks listen though
[12:34] we've got to take a piece of that and
[12:37] when the holy ghost came and broke
[12:39] through that sound barrier on the day of
[12:40] pentecost
[12:41] and went into those people in the licks
[12:43] of fire that's what came
[12:46] no more no less that's what showed up to
[12:50] burn
[12:51] your old nature out put his nature in
[12:54] and it's that same nature that's going
[12:56] to take you into the future home
[12:58] if not then you're going into these
[13:00] other dimensions that we're fixing to
[13:01] talk about
[13:04] where there's no hope listen if you know
[13:07] what you know now
[13:09] and you die and go in the fifth
[13:10] dimension
[13:12] we're in trouble because we know too
[13:15] much
[13:19] and it may be head knowledge but you
[13:20] know what i'd rather have a head
[13:21] knowledge
[13:23] and then get the holy ghost
[13:26] because the holy ghost said it leads you
[13:27] and guides you into all truth it just
[13:29] sparks what you got you gotta pack it in
[13:31] you gotta
[13:32] you can't just put the seed you can't
[13:34] i'm fixing to sew some
[13:35] listen man i'm gonna plant some taters
[13:37] tomorrow
[13:38] not potatoes we don't do that down south
[13:40] it's taters
[13:41] we're gonna plant taters later we'll
[13:43] plant maters but we're gonna plant
[13:44] taters tomorrow
[13:45] but you know what they're sitting on my
[13:47] kitchen counter right now they won't
[13:48] make one tater
[13:51] even though it's a tater even though
[13:53] it's got a little bud sticking up about
[13:55] this far getting ready
[13:56] to come up it will what it will die
[14:00] unless it's put into good ground it will
[14:02] die
[14:03] and wither and blow away just the
[14:05] parable tells us
[14:06] and that's the same thing i was thinking
[14:07] about when luis and bob were
[14:10] were speaking that all of us together as
[14:13] as a collective body we must realize
[14:18] that we were lost that we were
[14:21] gone away from god's economy this
[14:23] eternal plan of redemption yes amen we
[14:25] were a part of it in the mind of god
[14:27] but not down here because when those
[14:30] first three dimensions were set up when
[14:32] adam did what he did
[14:33] it slowed everything down and it just
[14:35] absolutely
[14:36] stuck us in this place
[14:40] but thank god for foreknowledge that he
[14:43] foreknew all that
[14:44] and he could put a place that he could
[14:47] have a fourth dimension that he could
[14:48] have a fifth dimension that he could
[14:50] have
[14:50] have a sixth dimension one faster than
[14:52] the other and even faster inside because
[14:54] we're going to see here tonight in the
[14:56] fifth dimension
[14:57] you've got to be careful right the fifth
[15:00] dimension is for the sin or dead
[15:02] but you got to remember
[15:05] only the redeemed go in the sixth
[15:07] dimension
[15:09] so where you gonna put the fullest
[15:10] version you're gonna put them in a
[15:11] burning in hell no
[15:13] you're going to put them in another
[15:14] place
[15:18] amen i'm going to read you here where
[15:20] the bible talks about a fifth sealed jew
[15:22] that they are somewhere crying how long
[15:24] how long
[15:26] huh right they're not in the fifth
[15:29] dimension they're crying how long
[15:31] because we
[15:31] thank god for the opening of seals we
[15:33] know who those people are they're
[15:35] sitting in a place what about a cup of
[15:36] water in my name they're going to be
[15:37] given eternal life
[15:38] they're going to be part of this eternal
[15:40] plan of redemption
[15:42] but where we're going to put them right
[15:45] we'll read some of this and we'll see
[15:46] all right so let's go
[15:49] i hope you love more today than you did
[15:51] yesterday
[15:53] i hope you love the lord more i hope
[15:55] he's i hope he you know at night now
[15:57] that
[15:58] we have so many people to pray for i'll
[16:00] just be honest
[16:01] i was honest with him up there i'll be
[16:03] honest with you i might not get the list
[16:04] finished before i fall asleep
[16:07] but you know what i didn't get finished
[16:08] a couple nights ago brother gary you
[16:10] know what happened
[16:11] two o'clock in the morning
[16:14] of course i had to go to the restaurant
[16:15] but still i was and i said oh i forgot
[16:18] to
[16:18] pray for this one and that one and this
[16:19] one and that one so hey you know what
[16:21] that's okay
[16:23] but you know what he loves that glory
[16:26] god
[16:26] loves for you to pray we should be a
[16:30] more prayerful people than ever before
[16:32] the bible says pray without ceasing so
[16:34] pray over everything even when you go in
[16:35] a
[16:35] restaurant or go in a grocery store and
[16:37] all the different things you
[16:38] pray that god will protect you
[16:42] uh we were um watching a little program
[16:45] while we were up there in illinois
[16:46] on the on the tube and it was these this
[16:49] man went around just
[16:52] kids were disappearing right under
[16:54] people's noses
[16:55] and they found out that he was a he was
[16:58] right there in the neighborhood and he
[16:59] was
[17:00] killing those kids and i'm just saying
[17:02] that you never know we need to be
[17:04] vigilant
[17:04] understand that god will protect you if
[17:07] you ask him to
[17:09] that's that's what makes me more i pray
[17:10] for my granddaughter all the time now
[17:13] you should pray for all yours that are
[17:14] getting and going in different
[17:15] directions and
[17:16] being able to go here and being able to
[17:18] go there and being able to drive a car
[17:22] oh goodness i'll give you gray hair
[17:27] when a 16 year old gets behind a wheel
[17:32] there is mercy and grace though so we
[17:34] just need to keep praying praying for
[17:36] them pray without ceasing
[17:38] all right number one job is the oldest
[17:39] book in the bible it's supposed to be
[17:40] written before moses we already read
[17:42] this but i like reading it again because
[17:43] look redemption is one of the oldest
[17:45] things in the bible
[17:46] so you can look back to all the
[17:48] different things that you want to in the
[17:49] bible read
[17:50] it has to do with redemption it doesn't
[17:52] matter what you're reading if even if
[17:54] it's rahab if it's talking about
[17:56] some of the worst people even ahab
[18:00] is in that plan of redemption because
[18:03] somebody like ahab had to be here
[18:06] and jezebel had to be here there to type
[18:10] here
[18:10] and that same spirit listen that spirit
[18:12] just come off of him and went into
[18:14] somebody else come off of him and went
[18:15] into somebody else amen
[18:17] so that spirit we're fighting those same
[18:19] spirits but you know what
[18:21] i believe you and i got something to
[18:22] fight it with
[18:25] i don't think we're using it as much as
[18:26] we should but we got something we've got
[18:28] an
[18:28] open book to fight him with there's no
[18:32] corner satan can hide in
[18:34] there's no word he can hide under
[18:36] because you know what he likes to hide
[18:37] in the word
[18:39] with those two spirits we were talking
[18:41] about that's where he likes to hide he's
[18:42] not hiding in the hockey thoughts he's
[18:44] not hiding in a strip joint
[18:46] he's hiding right here trying to do what
[18:49] he can to defeat you
[18:50] he's already got these people think
[18:52] about that folks when you go down
[18:54] and you look out at these people and you
[18:56] wonder what what purpose
[19:00] brother brown said cattle and fodder
[19:03] cannon fodder
[19:04] but you know what that's basically all
[19:06] they are right
[19:08] just take up space and one day they'll
[19:09] go out of existence please don't be that
[19:11] way
[19:12] if you get the baptism the holy ghost
[19:14] they ain't enough
[19:15] fire they ain't enough atomic weapons
[19:18] they ain't enough guns
[19:19] they'll ever get rid of you if you get
[19:21] the baptism in the holy ghost in your
[19:22] soul because that thing
[19:24] is eternal you can't kill it
[19:27] what the holy ghost come for to give you
[19:29] that assurance
[19:30] to give you that assurance that what we
[19:33] are part of this redemptive plan
[19:36] back in the back part of god's mind if
[19:37] brother branham would have uh
[19:39] let me say this if he would have stayed
[19:40] there long enough he'd have seen all of
[19:42] us
[19:43] but i believe when he went in the sixth
[19:44] dimension that's where he went
[19:47] he went in the mind of god because he
[19:49] saw all the people that were in the mind
[19:51] of god before the foundation of the
[19:52] world
[19:53] that had died under his ministry now
[19:55] remember he didn't see everybody just
[19:56] all the ones under
[19:58] his ministry all right so job is the
[20:00] oldest book in the bible redemption is
[20:02] one of the oldest things in the bible
[20:03] you know that redemption was the plan of
[20:05] redemption was laid out
[20:06] before the world was ever formed think
[20:08] of it
[20:10] and i want you to think of that look at
[20:13] all the things that happened in the old
[20:14] testament that we would think as dad was
[20:16] covering the other day that we would
[20:17] think that
[20:18] god should have went ahead and just
[20:19] destroyed david
[20:23] literally a murderer and he didn't
[20:26] murder somebody he hated
[20:28] he had his best guy right the guy was so
[20:31] loyal
[20:32] david was trying to get him to go home
[20:35] right to be with his wife so that he
[20:37] could cover up his
[20:38] adulterous act and the poor guy remember
[20:41] he said no i'll stay right here i'm
[20:43] gonna just lay on the floor
[20:45] and i bet that grounded old david too
[20:47] but remember he still did what he did
[20:49] you know why because he didn't have the
[20:50] baptism of the holy ghost if he
[20:52] had the baptism in the holy ghost that
[20:53] would never happen but
[20:56] covered under the blood of bulls and
[20:57] goats knowing that calvary was going to
[20:59] eradicate that one day that would be the
[21:03] eternal plan of redemption amen
[21:06] god foreseeing and making a way of
[21:09] redemption before he even made the world
[21:12] you know why because he knew it was
[21:13] going to fall just as soon as the thing
[21:14] started
[21:16] all right and he made this plan he
[21:18] didn't i was thinking about this coming
[21:20] down the road yesterday
[21:21] he didn't develop this plan while we
[21:24] were here
[21:26] he don't do that the plan was already
[21:28] developed
[21:29] before any of this ever got started
[21:31] because he saw it all
[21:32] start and happen and finish up and he
[21:35] says okay this is the way we're going to
[21:36] do it
[21:38] wow you just got to make sure you're a
[21:41] part of it
[21:43] titus 1 says paul in hope of eternal
[21:45] life we'll just kind of skip through
[21:46] these real quick i don't want to be
[21:49] be too late in hope of eternal life
[21:51] which god that cannot lie
[21:53] promise before the world began who do
[21:55] you promise it to
[21:57] he swore by himself
[22:00] he didn't ask the second person he
[22:03] didn't ask the third person
[22:05] he didn't even ask an angel and he
[22:08] didn't ask lucifer because lucifer
[22:09] didn't care
[22:11] so he swore by itself he said i'll do it
[22:14] i was reading in deuteronomy and and uh
[22:17] i think we got some scripture somewhere
[22:19] but it talks about that how
[22:21] god said i'm gonna bless you you do all
[22:22] this and i'm gonna bless you but if you
[22:24] do all this right here i'm going to
[22:25] curse you
[22:26] in deuteronomy manifem people could have
[22:28] just stayed in that part over here
[22:31] but you see though you see though the
[22:33] plan of redemption though because you
[22:35] see they didn't do hardly any of this
[22:37] they did all the bad but god had a
[22:39] provision for him
[22:41] he's got him locked away in that fifth
[22:42] dimension thank god for a prophet thank
[22:45] god for the open book
[22:46] that we can see that that fifth steel
[22:48] jew is somewhere
[22:50] crying how long how long to avenge our
[22:52] blood
[22:53] not talking to us not talking to
[22:57] gentiles
[22:58] he's talking they're talking to their
[23:00] brother the jew
[23:01] that's still on the earth today so that
[23:04] scripture is going to be fulfilled
[23:05] while we're when we're gone but we see
[23:07] it already we know where they are
[23:09] we know what's going to happen we know
[23:11] what group is going to be killed
[23:13] and we know what group is calling how
[23:14] long how long
[23:16] to avenge our blood let's go to
[23:19] ephesians
[23:21] one you know remember that we'll go to
[23:23] verse four
[23:25] according has chosen us in him now we
[23:27] kind of hung on that this weekend a
[23:29] little bit more
[23:31] we were chosen in him not of him
[23:34] before the foundation of the world that
[23:35] we might be holy and without blame
[23:37] before him in love
[23:39] having predestinated us into the
[23:40] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[23:43] himself according to the good pleasure
[23:45] of his will to the praise of the glory
[23:47] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[23:48] accepted
[23:50] in the beloved well it looks like
[23:52] there's not much not much room for
[23:53] sinning are they
[23:54] there's not much room for you or not
[23:56] dirty rascal no he's already paid for it
[23:59] it's already done you he and he knew
[24:01] whether you would ask forgiveness for it
[24:03] or not
[24:04] he knew you would or would not ask for
[24:06] forgiveness
[24:09] so in whom we have redemption through
[24:11] his blood the forgiveness of sins
[24:12] according to the riches of his grace
[24:14] wherein he has to bounded toward us in
[24:16] all wisdom and prudence
[24:17] look having made known to us
[24:21] i like that i've been reading that a
[24:22] little bit slower
[24:26] look having made known unto
[24:29] us the mystery of his will
[24:34] us the mystery of his will whatever that
[24:38] was in the back part of god's mind
[24:39] whatever that plan of redemption was
[24:41] wherever it went wherever it fell you
[24:43] and i can track it all the way now from
[24:45] before
[24:46] genesis all the way to the future home
[24:49] all right and you know what that don't
[24:51] make your head swell that makes you dig
[24:53] a little more to say god have i missed
[24:55] something
[24:56] have i missed a piece have i missed a
[24:58] piece in my life
[25:00] that i'm not living this plan that i'm
[25:02] supposed to live but you know what
[25:03] he saw you do that or he saw you didn't
[25:07] do it
[25:10] because you know what as brother brown
[25:11] said the holy ghost is a very
[25:13] timid individual he'll just let you
[25:15] continue on he gave you the spirit of
[25:17] adoption but
[25:18] if you don't want to climb that ladder
[25:20] it's up to you
[25:22] god's not going to drag you through a
[25:23] tube and pull you through it too no no
[25:25] no it's according to you
[25:29] but it's going to work to his perfect
[25:30] will as we see right here
[25:32] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[25:34] when he has to accept
[25:36] we made us accepted in the beloved in
[25:38] whom we have redemption through his
[25:39] blood the forgiveness of sins
[25:41] wherein he has to bound it toward i like
[25:42] that word having made known unto us the
[25:44] mystery of his will
[25:45] according to his good pleasure we are
[25:47] which he has purpose
[25:49] in himself i think god has fun
[25:52] amen i think he has fun i just don't
[25:55] think he's some
[25:56] you know we think you you look at these
[25:58] the way man
[25:59] depicts god he's this something you
[26:02] can't touch and he's like you know he's
[26:03] just
[26:06] no god's moving
[26:09] god's in action god knows what he's
[26:11] doing he knows the next step so he's
[26:13] right there
[26:14] omnipotent i'm pr i'm the president
[26:16] knows all things
[26:18] knows when you need it when you don't
[26:20] need it
[26:21] having made known in us the mystery of
[26:23] his will look that in the dispensation
[26:25] of the fullness of times he might gather
[26:26] together
[26:27] in one so who's he gathering it into
[26:31] the bride amen he's not gathering into a
[26:33] church he's not gathering into a
[26:35] building he's gathering into one
[26:37] group of people the bride of jesus
[26:39] christ you and i
[26:40] are recipients of this eternal plan of
[26:43] redemption
[26:44] and without the baptism of the holy
[26:46] ghost you don't have anything eternal
[26:50] there is nothing else eternal but the
[26:53] baptism of the holy ghost
[26:56] in whom also we have obtained an
[26:57] inheritance
[27:00] being predestinated according to the
[27:01] purpose of him who worketh all things
[27:04] after the council of his own will
[27:08] let's read romans 8 verse 28 we know all
[27:11] things think
[27:12] we we want to uh pray for brother joe on
[27:14] his way back but brother richard some of
[27:16] them are in the back
[27:17] we thank them for taking over and doing
[27:20] the work
[27:22] everybody working together and we know
[27:23] all things work together for good to
[27:25] them that love god
[27:27] to them who are the called according to
[27:28] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[27:31] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[27:33] the image of his son
[27:34] that he might be the firstborn among
[27:36] many brethren you know i read
[27:38] i read my most famous quote that always
[27:40] brings eyebrows up like this
[27:43] where brother brown said in adoption he
[27:46] said jesus didn't come to bring you an
[27:47] inheritance
[27:49] oh buddy there was a a couple of them i
[27:51] mean i said i said i
[27:52] love before you get before i make this
[27:55] quote
[27:56] i know what you're going to do you're
[27:57] going to do like this well two of them
[27:59] was like
[28:00] because jesus didn't come to britain he
[28:03] didn't come
[28:05] to you know what brother i'm saying
[28:07] jesus didn't come down here to develop
[28:09] an inheritance or to develop a plan
[28:11] while he was here
[28:13] it was already developed before the
[28:14] foundational world we just lost a way to
[28:17] get back
[28:18] that's why he said straight as a gate
[28:20] that's why he says i am the way that
[28:21] what
[28:22] the way back not not that he developed
[28:24] it down here
[28:26] right ah he died to get us back to the
[28:30] plan that was already before the
[28:31] foundation of the world i read that
[28:33] quote
[28:33] where brother brother brown said no no
[28:35] no jesus didn't come to bring me an
[28:37] inheritance he didn't come to bring you
[28:39] an inheritance
[28:40] and boy like oh my goodness and i read
[28:42] the quote to him
[28:44] i said jesus he said jesus came to get
[28:47] us back to our inheritance
[28:48] because our inheritance by foreknowledge
[28:51] was before the foundation of the world
[28:53] amen for those who did four knew he did
[28:56] predestinate to be conformed to the
[28:57] image of his son
[28:59] that he might be the firstborn among
[29:02] many brethren thank god that this plan
[29:04] doesn't change
[29:06] it's a never-changing plan it never
[29:08] changes
[29:10] so you know what it's not like see the
[29:12] devil will bring a plan to you and he'll
[29:14] get you
[29:16] but see if god works on you for a little
[29:18] while he's got to change it god doesn't
[29:21] satan has changed his plan he's got to
[29:23] change his tactic and go a little
[29:24] different way i swine so sneaky but god
[29:26] just says
[29:28] trust me believe me
[29:31] i died for you son i died for you
[29:34] daughter just believe what i've already
[29:35] done
[29:37] more over whom he did predestinate them
[29:39] he also called and whom he called he
[29:40] justified
[29:41] when he justified them he also glorified
[29:46] now we'll skip these two because one of
[29:49] them is on predestination we've already
[29:50] been through that brother dale's been
[29:52] over it we know by foreign knowledge
[29:54] looks back to destination and then in
[29:56] number two
[29:58] and that raised a few eyebrows too but i
[30:00] read the quote anyway because
[30:02] you know there is a quote where brother
[30:03] brown said you always were a grain of
[30:04] wheat
[30:05] you got to know what he's talking about
[30:07] though you got to separate the mind of
[30:10] god
[30:10] with what you were born down here amen
[30:13] everybody got that that's the whole
[30:15] problem they can't get them separated
[30:16] but when you read them this quote right
[30:18] here says
[30:19] in questions and answers in 1964 after
[30:21] the seals broke
[30:22] how can i take a cup of water and make a
[30:23] grain of wheat out of it now brother
[30:25] brown you said we always were wheat
[30:28] well in the mind of god we always were
[30:30] weak
[30:31] but you a cocker bar
[30:36] all of you stinky cuckoo bird
[30:41] june and i we're walking through the
[30:42] woods looking for some uh for those of
[30:44] you that don't know what a deershed is a
[30:46] deer sheds its horns
[30:47] every year so they drop in the woods and
[30:50] we try to find them and we did find one
[30:52] but anyway so we weren't talking about
[30:53] something jensen then looked and she
[30:55] said
[30:56] kookaburra it had stuck and it stuck on
[30:59] my side
[31:00] but it was a cocker bar and it was
[31:01] sticky it stuck me
[31:03] that's the same way you are you always
[31:05] gonna be sticky
[31:08] if you're looking for for complete
[31:10] perfection
[31:12] you ain't gonna get it right till the
[31:14] body changed brother brown said you're
[31:16] going to be sticky
[31:19] your nature
[31:22] as long as you're in this life down at
[31:24] the bottom as long as you're in this
[31:25] life you're going to be sticky
[31:27] and have a carnal nature but what's
[31:28] happened
[31:30] yes brother dale deals with all these
[31:33] sticky cuckoomers
[31:38] but he knows down in most of us is a
[31:41] wheat germ
[31:43] and if we have to put you in the grave
[31:45] we put the cuckoo bird in the grave
[31:47] we don't put the wheat germ in the grave
[31:50] and when it comes back up guess what by
[31:51] the transforming power of jesus christ
[31:53] that's going to look like them
[31:55] downstairs
[31:56] and it's going to be what full wheat
[31:59] but there's going to be a group of
[32:00] people
[32:03] that this cuckoo bird is going to be
[32:04] changed
[32:06] to a wheat all the way through from
[32:08] inside out
[32:10] amen and i say this to be
[32:15] to be honest we're waiting on that right
[32:18] because the bible said paul says waiting
[32:21] to wit the redemption of the body we're
[32:23] we're waiting while we're moving it's
[32:24] not we're waiting
[32:27] we're not waiting in the waiting room
[32:29] for the baby to be born
[32:31] no baby's here but we're waiting and not
[32:35] getting ahead how many times brother
[32:36] brown said many people go ahead of god's
[32:38] program
[32:39] try to go ahead of god's program what
[32:40] does he say you see scrap heaps of
[32:42] ministers
[32:44] what trying to push the plan
[32:47] trying to push the plan without what
[32:49] holy ghost
[32:50] virtue knowledge temperance i was
[32:53] telling them up there
[32:55] and brother tim said he'd never seen it
[32:56] that way before but remember brother
[32:57] dale preached on the statue of perfect
[32:59] man not too long ago
[33:00] and he took all the definitions and the
[33:02] definitions that man has for these
[33:04] virtues is different than the definition
[33:06] that
[33:07] that brother branham brought for these
[33:08] virtues
[33:10] amen it took a profit to do that so now
[33:12] we're not looking at this going well now
[33:14] virtue is
[33:15] is just being a virgin no that's not
[33:17] what he said he said that's having what
[33:19] power that's having strength
[33:22] holy ghost strength that's holy ghost
[33:25] knowledge that's not the knowledge of
[33:27] man
[33:28] that's not not drinking alcohol because
[33:30] that's what man says temperance means in
[33:31] the webster dictionary
[33:33] but when you bring a prophet now he said
[33:35] no no no that's not what that means
[33:37] he said that's controlling your ungodly
[33:41] temper
[33:42] same way with all these others and i
[33:43] really appreciate that and so did they
[33:45] maybe it'll spark some of them to start
[33:47] studying a little more because if you
[33:48] read all the definitions of these it's
[33:49] just you know
[33:51] you really get confused because if
[33:54] you're born again you're already a virtu
[33:56] you're already a virgin in christ so why
[33:59] is this right here that's why people get
[34:00] all this confused but if you'll take
[34:02] virtue as what the prophet said
[34:04] knowledge is what the prophet tells us
[34:06] temperance is what the prophet tells us
[34:09] beautiful picture thank you lord virtue
[34:12] is strength virtue is what strength
[34:14] that you give to somebody else and
[34:17] without the new birth what brother i'm
[34:18] saying he said you write the check
[34:20] he said that there's nothing in the bank
[34:23] insufficient funds but remember if we've
[34:27] got it
[34:28] if we've got the baptism of the holy
[34:29] ghost you can't out you can't outright
[34:32] the checks that god give
[34:33] gives you no way you can out give
[34:36] god so you're going to be sticky and
[34:38] have a carnal nature
[34:40] that's going to bother you as long as
[34:41] you live but the inside of you you're
[34:43] born again
[34:44] and when you're raised up you're in the
[34:45] likeness of christ and all the sin has
[34:47] gone from you
[34:48] see that's the thing
[34:52] and as brother bob was talking about
[34:53] sunday afternoon that's what the holy
[34:54] ghost was given for
[34:58] if the holy ghost is not given we're
[34:59] just all pure huckleberries and we're
[35:01] all going to hell
[35:03] but you can still be a cuckoomer and
[35:06] have the holy ghost inside of you
[35:08] and be pure weep and listen
[35:11] that's a mystery that's why i was
[35:13] thinking about coming up down up the
[35:14] road down the road
[35:16] that's the mystery the greatest mystery
[35:20] is that
[35:22] you did what you don't do what no more
[35:27] you don't now that old man i remember he
[35:29] used to cuss
[35:32] we had a discussion about that in the
[35:34] dentist office the other day
[35:36] i gave him a testimony about how that i
[35:38] was going to say a bad word
[35:39] and remember the lord hit me right in
[35:41] the chest and thrown all the air out of
[35:42] my
[35:43] out of my lungs so i couldn't say it why
[35:46] because that old sticky nature i was
[35:47] leaning to i was talking to somebody in
[35:49] the world and i
[35:50] this has been 15 years ago but god will
[35:53] tell you
[35:54] he'll put you somewhere in a place you
[35:56] were before
[35:58] and if you don't do something different
[36:01] you didn't get different back then amen
[36:04] but you know
[36:05] when i believe god gives you little
[36:07] markers
[36:08] along the way that you can say the
[36:11] things i used to do
[36:13] i do them no more now it doesn't listen
[36:17] i'll be honest with you i used to curse
[36:19] really bad
[36:21] they still run through my brain we're
[36:24] humans
[36:26] amen right let's just be honest we're
[36:29] cuckoo birds
[36:31] our memory reason conscious affection
[36:33] imagination has still got kookaburra
[36:35] sticky on it
[36:36] your soul doesn't but see that man we
[36:40] need to let that man take over and he'll
[36:42] push all that other out
[36:44] now listen we'll remember what we did
[36:46] and we'll let things run through our
[36:47] head
[36:48] listen but remember before you were born
[36:51] again what did you do
[36:53] you had a four inch pipe from here down
[36:55] to here and you just let it roll
[36:57] right but the holy ghost is giving you
[37:00] what
[37:00] or something to close that thing up with
[37:04] and i thank god for that but you can't
[37:08] help it to go through your brain that's
[37:09] where the sticky part is
[37:11] brother brown listen brother brown's not
[37:12] telling you you're going to be a sinner
[37:14] all your life
[37:15] he's telling you that you're going to do
[37:17] things wrong you're going to remember
[37:19] the things you used to do
[37:21] but god does not remember them
[37:24] and the holy ghost that's inside of you
[37:26] didn't do it anyway
[37:31] so why what's he looking at me no if i
[37:33] have the baptism of the holy ghost i
[37:35] thought the bible said
[37:36] first first scripture said by his blood
[37:38] right
[37:40] we have forgiveness of sins and it
[37:42] doesn't just forgive us it eradicates it
[37:44] right it doesn't go it doesn't keep
[37:46] going to god now see satan's over here
[37:48] trying to keep throwing it up
[37:50] but you and i i don't know why i'm
[37:52] getting on this i'm not getting anywhere
[37:54] but that
[37:55] to me that's the whole thing that's
[37:56] hindering us is we just don't think
[37:58] we're good enough because we think like
[38:00] we used to think
[38:02] let those things run through your head
[38:04] but let them run out the other side
[38:08] amen
[38:11] i start singing hymns every once in a
[38:13] while start quoting scripture
[38:17] start saying i love you lord right and
[38:20] you'll see the old devil
[38:21] he can't stand it let's go to the
[38:24] dimensions and look real quick
[38:28] remember light time and matter we looked
[38:30] in in luke 16 and i want you to see
[38:33] something
[38:34] now remember as we spoke on before
[38:37] i want you to remember this that
[38:38] remember you and that you and i
[38:40] listen in in theophany form
[38:44] was created first
[38:49] we weren't people we were attributes
[38:54] because if you don't then genesis 1 26
[38:56] is wrong
[38:57] genesis 1 26 says let us make man in our
[39:00] own image and in our likeness
[39:03] that was me and you but remember
[39:07] then it comes down to adam and adam was
[39:10] a spirit man first
[39:12] because he could contact god through
[39:14] that spirit form
[39:15] with no limitations then he took adam in
[39:18] genesis 2 7 and put him in flesh
[39:21] see takes phil smelling here but
[39:23] remember it didn't do away or detach
[39:26] that person that he was the spirit realm
[39:28] first right
[39:30] in other words like i said it didn't
[39:31] change him no he just put what brother
[39:33] i'm saying he put that spirit into the
[39:36] 2-7 man
[39:38] the flesh guy to contact the earth by
[39:41] what
[39:42] sea tastes filled smelling here but
[39:43] remember i read you the quote before
[39:45] brother brown
[39:46] says god does not all those five senses
[39:51] you can fake them amen
[39:56] jim makes a hunting soap for us
[39:59] for deer hunters it smells just like
[40:01] dirt but it's liquid in a bottle
[40:05] that's a deception it's not dirt
[40:08] smells like dirt but you know what i
[40:11] like dirt
[40:12] it's liquid but man by chemical has put
[40:15] the things together and all these other
[40:16] scents that you smell and you think
[40:18] man i'm in a rose garden and you open
[40:20] your eyes and it's a bottle of lavender
[40:22] yeah that they've synthetically
[40:25] produced
[40:29] but see that's the way satan is
[40:32] satan is what he's an impersonator
[40:36] see tastes filled smelling here don't
[40:38] ever depend on it
[40:40] but remember as bob was saying sunday
[40:42] though if you connect
[40:44] to the eternal then your vision changes
[40:48] you don't look at that woman anymore
[40:52] you don't taste that beer anymore
[40:56] you don't feel the things you used to
[40:57] feel the beer can you understand what i
[40:59] mean
[41:01] so what's he done he's just took out the
[41:02] old nature put in the new nature and you
[41:04] still got your five senses
[41:06] so the five senses and that's another
[41:08] eye opener they had i said look
[41:10] tell me how many times your flesh has
[41:12] sinned
[41:14] and they're all going oh man i said zero
[41:21] your flesh only reacts to what's inside
[41:24] of you
[41:27] we know it was born in sin it was a
[41:30] product of sin
[41:32] but your flesh is not what you need to
[41:34] worry about
[41:36] remember what god said in the scripture
[41:38] he said do not fear the man that can
[41:40] kill you
[41:41] in other words you fear the man that can
[41:43] kill the soul
[41:44] so that soul has got to go into another
[41:46] dimension like we were talking about
[41:47] it's got to go through a fifth dimension
[41:49] it's got to
[41:49] be either being a sixth dimension
[41:51] because it's going to have to fifth
[41:52] dimension is going to have stand
[41:53] judgment sixth
[41:55] dimension you're judged down here you
[41:56] don't have to stand in judgment
[41:59] look at this wonderful plan that god set
[42:02] up for all of us
[42:03] right if we'll just believe it
[42:07] but we were made spirit man first
[42:08] brother brown i didn't bring the quote
[42:10] but brother brown said now
[42:11] spirit so he could contact god
[42:14] see you can't contact god with your
[42:15] flesh right
[42:18] remember your flesh don't contact your
[42:21] flesh is five outlets that whatever's
[42:23] inside of you
[42:24] uses amen the inside man's the control
[42:28] tower
[42:30] he controls the memory reason conscious
[42:32] effects and imagination
[42:33] and your body just moves because that
[42:35] inside god tells it what to do
[42:37] but remember now that you've got the
[42:38] baptism of the holy ghost
[42:40] you grab water
[42:44] before the baptism from the holy ghost
[42:46] you went got you a beer
[42:47] or some liquor you understand what i
[42:50] mean
[42:51] that's why the holy ghost is the most
[42:52] important thing because down inside of
[42:54] you
[42:55] is what matters
[42:58] this right here doesn't matter
[43:01] this thing right here is what's inside
[43:05] because what's going to happen this
[43:06] thing's going to separate into a grave
[43:08] if you have to go by the grave
[43:10] and if you don't have the baptism of
[43:12] holy ghost you still got to go pick that
[43:13] back up
[43:15] and be and be judged for what you did
[43:18] in this flesh not of the flesh because
[43:21] look
[43:23] then you and i are in pri in trouble we
[43:26] all were born flesh
[43:28] we all have to carry this thing
[43:31] somewhere
[43:33] think about that we have to carry this
[43:36] thing somewhere
[43:38] when mom and daddy brought it here we
[43:39] got trapped in the first three
[43:41] dimensions
[43:42] everything's slowed down we can't go
[43:44] through a wall we can't what
[43:45] contact the fourth dimension we can't we
[43:48] can't
[43:49] just do like adam and control the whole
[43:51] world
[43:53] we wish with the holy ghost
[43:58] but we can't we're trapped by what adam
[44:01] and eve did we it trapped us into the
[44:03] first three dimensions and we have to go
[44:05] through time
[44:06] we have to go in tight listen time
[44:08] always equals death
[44:11] because there's no time in god but time
[44:14] always equals death if you go through
[44:16] time you're going to die that's why
[44:18] there's even time in the millennium
[44:20] because there's people going to die
[44:22] at the battle of gog and magog at the
[44:25] end of it there's people going to die
[44:27] that's why you're still in the old
[44:29] seventh day
[44:31] by the baptism of holy ghost we've all
[44:33] been moved into the eighth day
[44:36] sitting in heavenly places let's realize
[44:39] that
[44:42] stop sometime and just say thank you
[44:45] lord
[44:46] thank you for giving me something i
[44:49] didn't even want
[44:52] oh no you searched all your no you did
[44:55] not
[44:56] scumbag all of us
[45:01] telling them that up in tennessee we we
[45:04] were all married
[45:06] we all had marriage problems
[45:10] we were born married to the wrong person
[45:13] born between satan and eve doomed and on
[45:16] our way to hell
[45:18] but listen you still got to take your
[45:21] flesh somewhere
[45:23] it's either going to go in a grave the
[45:26] soul is going to go to a dimension
[45:28] but wherever that pair wherever that
[45:30] soul is got to come back and pick that
[45:32] body back up
[45:34] that's why god thinks so much of you
[45:36] he's not going to separate you but just
[45:37] for a little while if you have to die
[45:39] it's not going to matter just for a
[45:40] little while you're going to be in the
[45:41] sixth dimension but you're going to come
[45:43] back and pick that body back up
[45:44] that's why i do not believe that you're
[45:45] going to get a new body as far as
[45:47] another body
[45:49] no you were born with this one god loves
[45:51] you in this body that you're in if
[45:53] you're full of the holy ghost
[45:56] you know why because you don't know what
[45:58] i just got this the only way you can
[45:59] show the world
[46:01] the whole world does not know jesus
[46:04] christ
[46:07] but you do and you're the only one and
[46:10] how you going to manifest it
[46:15] oh but y'all just y'all all boy yeah
[46:18] admit it we're all born in sin right
[46:21] right
[46:22] but by the transforming power of god
[46:26] amen he put the wheat in the cuckoo bar
[46:31] you can't do that if i plant them taters
[46:35] tomorrow
[46:36] i'm not gonna get pineapples right
[46:39] but you know what if god wanted
[46:41] pineapples he could change the life of
[46:43] that
[46:44] tater and make it a pineapple but you
[46:46] and i can't do that
[46:48] but god can't and he said he'd change
[46:51] even the vilest of sin or he'll change
[46:54] you
[46:57] you may think your life's falling apart
[47:01] not if you got the holy ghost today
[47:06] your kuckleberg may be falling apart
[47:10] me about it i've been to the doctor more
[47:11] than two weeks this last two weeks and
[47:12] i've been in my life
[47:14] so anyway but you know what it's because
[47:18] we were trapped in this dimension
[47:20] by adam and eve and what the devil did
[47:22] the devil had to come into this
[47:23] dimension to do what he did
[47:25] amen
[47:28] look in luke 16 verse 25 says but
[47:32] abraham said son remember
[47:34] that our in that lifetime receiveth thy
[47:37] good things now we're going to use this
[47:38] scripture again
[47:39] when we get into the sixth dimension
[47:40] because according to the
[47:43] excuse me the prophet of god there was a
[47:45] a space called paradise
[47:47] that the old testament saints were
[47:49] caught in which is not the sixth
[47:51] dimension because remember
[47:52] when we'll get to it not today but later
[47:56] when the witch of endor brought samuel
[47:58] up he wasn't a young man turned back
[48:01] he was still samuel with the prophet's
[48:04] robe on right
[48:06] so the so going into paradise was just a
[48:08] holding place because look the blood of
[48:10] bulls and goats
[48:11] couldn't take that soul of samuel and
[48:14] turn it back young again
[48:18] right right but now
[48:22] when you come over here and you let the
[48:24] prophet of god go behind the curtain of
[48:25] time
[48:27] after the baptism of the holy ghost has
[48:28] been given after the sixth dimension has
[48:30] been
[48:31] set up for for the people that have
[48:33] eternal life
[48:34] then what were they all young people
[48:38] young men and women some people he
[48:39] didn't even know because they were
[48:41] that 90 year old woman was 90 years old
[48:43] the last time he saw him
[48:44] but she was 20 years old in this
[48:46] dimension look at the difference look at
[48:48] what god's done with this eternal plan
[48:50] of redemption is so perfect
[48:52] but he tells here it says abrahams
[48:55] because they did call paradise
[48:56] look up the word paradise in the bible
[48:58] it's only like four times
[48:59] but you see that it's also called the
[49:01] bosom of abraham which is the place it's
[49:03] not abraham standing there
[49:05] you know lazarus wasn't laying but just
[49:07] a story read
[49:08] listen to the story but abraham said son
[49:11] remember that thou in thy lifetime
[49:12] receiveth thy good things
[49:14] and likewise lives was evil things but
[49:16] now he is comforted and thou are
[49:17] tormented
[49:18] and besides all this between us and you
[49:20] there is a great gulf
[49:22] fixed so that they which pass from hence
[49:26] to you cannot neither can they pass to
[49:28] us
[49:29] that would come from this in other words
[49:31] there's no way to pass between
[49:33] this dimension is locked in and this
[49:35] dimension is locked in
[49:36] amen because you know what it's the plan
[49:39] of god why would you just
[49:40] why would you just you know everybody
[49:43] that dies he just they just dumped them
[49:44] into one
[49:45] place he wouldn't be a just god if he
[49:48] did that
[49:49] right because the judgment of what
[49:52] they'd done like brother man we'll read
[49:53] hearing about the fifth dimension
[49:55] he said that sinner's caught between the
[49:57] two world he's caught between can't go
[49:58] back to earth
[49:59] and he can't go to heaven or the sixth
[50:01] dimension he's caught in between that
[50:04] why because he's sinned here
[50:08] right the way the tree falls that's the
[50:10] way it leans you know in other words
[50:12] if you're a sinner here now there are
[50:15] provisions to get eternal life i know
[50:17] that but listen if you're
[50:20] adolf hitler here you're going to raise
[50:22] adolf hitler and you're going to go to
[50:23] the white throne judgment
[50:24] okay there's no uh there's no
[50:28] see you got to have judgment
[50:32] i love it when people preach on god
[50:34] being a good loving gracious god
[50:36] i know that but he's also a judge
[50:39] he's not a granddaddy he's a daddy and
[50:42] buddy if you get out of line you're
[50:44] going to pay for it remember brother
[50:45] brown says you sent a sin as a christian
[50:47] you will reap a tub full
[50:49] amen thank god for a prophet that can
[50:53] explain these things gloria and that he
[50:56] could it helps us in our everyday life
[50:58] not just it
[50:58] you know and we we glory that that we
[51:01] have an open book but just even to be a
[51:03] normal christian
[51:04] the prophet of god helped a lot of us
[51:06] just live through certain things to get
[51:07] through things
[51:09] that we that we would have never got
[51:10] through if james dobson not saying
[51:12] anything about them but just the big
[51:13] names
[51:14] max liquido and all those different ones
[51:16] i brother branham's
[51:18] to me that's good enough he's good
[51:21] enough for us to
[51:22] to put our faith in what he said and uh
[51:25] know that he is uh he's fallible but his
[51:28] the word he brought was infallible
[51:30] amen all right so now this we were on
[51:33] for knowledge so we get done with four
[51:35] knowledge
[51:36] we're done with that and now we're on
[51:39] the dimensions now let's go to the
[51:40] present stage of my ministry number one
[51:44] now when we come along we remember that
[51:46] we live here in three dimensions now
[51:47] brother brown
[51:49] tells us what they are one of them is
[51:50] light the other one is matter tommy you
[51:52] remember these
[51:53] adam but it's not adam it's time light
[51:55] matter and time and our five senses
[51:57] contact these dimensions
[51:59] our sight contacts light our feeling
[52:01] contacts matter
[52:02] and so forth in other words we've come
[52:05] from
[52:06] from now we've all become after adam and
[52:09] eve did what they did
[52:10] we all come down to where we have to be
[52:12] born in this dimension
[52:13] we can't travel between dimensions
[52:16] now god can come into this dimension and
[52:18] talk to us that's what he does
[52:20] that's why i said you don't get a
[52:21] revelation in this dimension these first
[52:22] three dimensions is just a temporary
[52:24] place
[52:25] what for us to develop this plan of
[52:27] redemption for god to develop it to the
[52:30] human being and give them a choice and
[52:32] then
[52:32] after that is where it starts splitting
[52:34] up into the different different
[52:35] dimensions
[52:36] all right has everybody got that so
[52:39] we become solid we become light we have
[52:41] to have light to live
[52:43] we have to have the matter we we have to
[52:45] have some sort of matter
[52:47] to put this building together to put the
[52:49] car together to eat you eat matter
[52:51] all right the things that we do to
[52:53] sustain this life
[52:55] we had to have but
[52:58] remember it's all contrary to god
[53:02] the light he wants you to see is the
[53:05] light he created before the world
[53:07] before he created the sun and the moon
[53:09] that's the sustaining light we're
[53:11] looking for
[53:12] and also we're looking for what the
[53:14] matter and we're also looking for what
[53:16] time to be no longer time to be
[53:18] temporary and then all of a sudden time
[53:20] will go away
[53:22] didn't brother ram tell us one time and
[53:23] this is how strange because you you
[53:25] wonder you think man
[53:27] poor old uh abel's been dead for what
[53:31] six seven thousand years
[53:33] he's the first one to die and have to go
[53:35] into one of these dimensions he was the
[53:36] first one to have to die
[53:37] he's been dead a long time you know what
[53:39] brother brown said one time he said
[53:40] martin luther he said he when he
[53:43] resurrects it will be just like he laid
[53:45] down and went to sleep the night before
[53:46] and woke up the next morning why because
[53:49] we're in time
[53:50] six thousand time years has went by but
[53:53] abel's probably going
[53:55] man when he starts when he resurrects
[53:58] he's going like
[53:59] it was just yesterday oh
[54:02] thank god i mean thank god that that's
[54:05] the way it is martin luther
[54:06] that'd be wonderful him to wake up and
[54:08] go i was only asleep
[54:10] you know just today it's like some of
[54:12] y'all sleeping now
[54:18] wake up and it might be tomorrow
[54:23] saying no more on that one okay
[54:27] so now let's look john 12
[54:30] verse 28 the reason i'm bringing this
[54:33] right here though
[54:34] is to tell you what happened from a
[54:37] different perspective
[54:38] what happened in this church age
[54:41] all right that happened in no other
[54:43] church age that we can record
[54:45] that it happened it's that god brought a
[54:48] message to a prophet
[54:50] and there was noise thunders there was
[54:53] lightning
[54:54] there was voice of god there was a cloud
[54:58] everybody got that the reason that is
[55:02] is because god came into this dimension
[55:06] with a message he came from a faster
[55:09] dimension which is in eternity
[55:11] he came to hear because look what
[55:12] brother brown said let's read john 12
[55:15] father glorify thy name then came their
[55:16] voice from heaven saying i have both
[55:18] glorified it
[55:19] and will glorify it again the people
[55:20] therefore that stood by and heard it
[55:22] said it thundered
[55:23] others said an angel spoke to spake to
[55:25] him brother branham was standing on the
[55:26] rock that day
[55:28] and remember the whirlwind comes down
[55:29] over him and it makes all kind of noise
[55:31] it bursts
[55:31] rocks everywhere and he told the people
[55:33] to get under the get under the
[55:35] uh truck and you know hide in the bushes
[55:38] when it was all over what'd he say it
[55:41] was it was just a bunch of noise to them
[55:42] brothers they scared to death
[55:44] and here stands a prophet right in the
[55:46] middle of it rock's going everywhere
[55:49] and god's talking to him he come from
[55:52] eternity
[55:53] into this slower dimension
[55:57] and gave brother random a revelation he
[55:58] said hey what did he do he threw that
[56:00] rock up in the air and he said judgment
[56:01] will strike the west coast
[56:03] and in 1964 alaska like the sunk into
[56:06] the ocean
[56:07] that was god speaking to a prophet now
[56:10] you and i listen you know i don't
[56:11] we love to talk about these experiences
[56:13] but you and i are going to have to have
[56:15] an
[56:15] experience where god's thunders to you
[56:19] you've got to have a voice of god
[56:22] that we're because look let's let's
[56:25] let's analyze that just for a second
[56:27] that's okay because look he said john
[56:29] john 12 28 says father glorify the name
[56:32] trying to get this right because i
[56:33] thought about it a minute ago and i've
[56:34] lost my thought
[56:35] then came their voice from heaven saying
[56:36] i have both glorified and glorified
[56:38] again
[56:38] so in other words he brought him a
[56:39] message the people that were around him
[56:42] though
[56:43] heard it and said it thundered others
[56:44] said an angel so they were in contention
[56:46] about what was being said
[56:50] right but who was he talking to
[56:53] he was talking to jesus who was the
[56:56] angel
[56:57] that knocked paul off of the horse he
[57:00] wasn't talking to the little people that
[57:02] was around him
[57:03] though it be maybe this guy was a
[57:05] captain and this guy was a good preacher
[57:10] but he came and spoke to paul right but
[57:12] now what did paul do with it though
[57:15] here's the whole thing paul took that
[57:18] message that he got from god to the
[57:20] world
[57:21] that's the same thing with me and you
[57:23] that right there
[57:25] how did he glorify the name look i have
[57:29] both glorified it
[57:30] what at that moment and i'm going to
[57:33] glorify it again
[57:34] that means that that same man
[57:38] inside of a bride is going to hear a
[57:41] thunder
[57:43] it's going to hear a voice of god it's
[57:45] going to get a revelation that's going
[57:47] to take us
[57:48] into another dimension amen
[57:51] and there's going to be people standing
[57:53] around you
[57:55] how many people stand around you oh
[57:57] here's my thought back again how many
[57:58] people stand around you on a daily basis
[58:00] and don't understand you
[58:04] don't understand how why
[58:09] what do you mean you don't what it's
[58:13] god can speak to them the same way
[58:14] speaks to you
[58:16] but god has given you the opportunity
[58:19] for him to speak to you but all the all
[58:21] the other people here's noise
[58:23] thunder see a light maybe see a cloud
[58:27] a lot of people saw that cloud
[58:30] millions probably and millions have seen
[58:32] it afterwards that book's going for like
[58:34] 300
[58:35] a copy now the the book that that was
[58:38] the picture of it was in
[58:41] what does that matter i mean really
[58:45] but you know what it's a sign to me
[58:46] though that god came through a dimension
[58:49] and came down and give us a cloud
[58:54] and that we can not just it's not just
[58:56] you know
[58:57] that when we first come in the message
[59:00] you know they was trying to pick out all
[59:02] the things where you can see the horse
[59:03] rider right here
[59:05] sitting a man sitting on the horse
[59:06] there's a horse's legs oh and they were
[59:09] showing us the eagle and they were like
[59:10] you know oh boy this has got all kind of
[59:12] all kind of symbols in it that's okay
[59:18] but did they get the voice behind that
[59:22] most of them did not they got blinded by
[59:25] the light
[59:28] and even in revelation 6 1 says when i
[59:30] lamb opened one of the seals i heard it
[59:32] was what the noise of thunder
[59:35] the noise of thunder one of the four
[59:38] beasts said
[59:39] come and see and we know that the next
[59:43] one
[59:43] is in jehovah gyra 1961
[59:47] we were talking about sound barrier the
[59:48] other day
[59:50] any time the sound barrier is like 700
[59:53] miles an hour anytime you break through
[59:54] the sound barrier
[59:55] there's always a noise and there's
[59:57] always a vapor cloud made by it
[1:00:00] if you'll watch and see when chuck
[1:00:02] yeager you can see the
[1:00:03] the picture of when he broke the sound
[1:00:05] barrier back into whatever was the 60s
[1:00:08] you see this big cloud now it's not
[1:00:10] shaped like that but it's a big cloud
[1:00:12] goes all the way as soon as he broke
[1:00:13] that sound barrier there was vapor went
[1:00:15] everywhere
[1:00:16] and the sound barrier what went off but
[1:00:19] listen
[1:00:20] it happened because somebody
[1:00:24] believed
[1:00:27] they could break it if you'll read a
[1:00:30] story chuck yeager they always get to
[1:00:32] about 600 miles an hour in some of the
[1:00:34] other test flights
[1:00:35] and the things start shaking so bad they
[1:00:37] think it's gonna
[1:00:38] break in half and they back off
[1:00:42] chuck yeager read a story he said when
[1:00:46] it started he said i still had plenty of
[1:00:48] throttle left
[1:00:49] and he just put her forward when he did
[1:00:51] and let's read this right here sometimes
[1:00:53] when you get a place you battle
[1:00:55] can break to that sound barrier as they
[1:00:57] tell me when a plane is trying to get
[1:00:58] through the sound barrier
[1:01:00] it just almost shakes the bolts out of
[1:01:02] it but after getting through the sound
[1:01:04] barrier
[1:01:05] it's all right then it can just run with
[1:01:07] ease
[1:01:08] if you can just break through that
[1:01:10] static of superstition and things then
[1:01:12] the holy spirit
[1:01:13] just begins to fall around like
[1:01:15] anointing and blesses the people
[1:01:17] but so many people of today are so
[1:01:19] babied so petty
[1:01:20] little petty what they pull back on the
[1:01:23] throttle
[1:01:25] when your world starts shaking push that
[1:01:27] baby forward
[1:01:29] break through that sound barrier and
[1:01:30] you'll get a cloud and brother branham
[1:01:32] then is this a
[1:01:33] sign of the end sir look here real quick
[1:01:36] i'm going to paraphrase if you don't
[1:01:37] mind
[1:01:39] you can paraphrase scripture but boy
[1:01:41] they don't want you to paraphrase quotes
[1:01:44] bless their heart but remember the
[1:01:46] analogy there was little bitty birds
[1:01:48] there was bigger birds and they were
[1:01:50] coming at a certain speed
[1:01:52] but remember when he got to the very
[1:01:54] last one it was what angels
[1:01:56] and they came he said they came from
[1:01:58] eternity
[1:02:01] let's go down to paragraph 205 but it
[1:02:03] shook the earth
[1:02:05] remember there was a what go to 204
[1:02:09] first a blast and i thought it sounded
[1:02:11] like a sound barrier ever what you call
[1:02:13] it when planes crossed the sound
[1:02:15] and the sound comes back to the earth
[1:02:16] just shook like roared
[1:02:19] then i could have been it could have
[1:02:20] been a great clap of thunder and
[1:02:21] lightning like i didn't see the
[1:02:22] lightning i just heard that great blast
[1:02:24] that went forth that sounded
[1:02:26] like it was south from me towards mexico
[1:02:28] but it shook the earth
[1:02:31] and when it did i was still looking
[1:02:33] westward the way off into eternity i saw
[1:02:35] a constellation of something coming
[1:02:37] it looked like it might have been little
[1:02:39] dots there could have been no less than
[1:02:41] five no more than seven
[1:02:43] but they were in the shape of a pyramid
[1:02:44] like these messengers coming and when it
[1:02:46] did
[1:02:46] the power of almighty god lifted me up
[1:02:49] to meet them
[1:02:51] and they were angels traveling faster
[1:02:53] than sound could travel
[1:02:54] paragraph 207 they came from eternity in
[1:02:57] a split
[1:02:58] like a twinkling of an eye
[1:03:02] how many of you have got a revelation
[1:03:05] and it just shake your soul
[1:03:08] that's god coming from another dimension
[1:03:12] he's breaking through this slow thing
[1:03:14] that we're in he's breaking through this
[1:03:16] huckleberry that we got around us he's
[1:03:18] breaking through our memory reason
[1:03:19] conscious effects and imagination
[1:03:21] and he's going right down to that soul
[1:03:22] and he said here i am
[1:03:25] this is what that's why i think brother
[1:03:27] branham he was so happy
[1:03:29] i believe he they told him go back to
[1:03:30] jeffersonville
[1:03:32] and these things will be told to you in
[1:03:34] other words there'll be things told to
[1:03:35] you that never has been told before
[1:03:38] the book still closed but now we're
[1:03:40] getting ready to open the book
[1:03:41] and william branham you're the only one
[1:03:43] that's going to hear it
[1:03:44] at this moment everybody all right with
[1:03:47] that
[1:03:49] but he did get a revelation and he did
[1:03:52] deliver it to the people
[1:03:55] you and i and he said it went like
[1:04:01] but when he came back i was reading in
[1:04:04] questions and answers on on the seals
[1:04:07] he said i've never worked in a realm
[1:04:09] like this before
[1:04:11] never ever and i mean what has he been
[1:04:13] through millions of people being healed
[1:04:16] because he's in 1963. he said i've never
[1:04:19] worked in
[1:04:19] and he walks through the pulpit never
[1:04:21] gets really excited
[1:04:24] millions of people turn him down can't
[1:04:26] hear the thunder
[1:04:28] they might hear the thunder but they
[1:04:30] never heard the voice that was beside
[1:04:31] that
[1:04:32] and that was the problem they didn't
[1:04:33] hear what they were supposed to hear
[1:04:36] because what happened they did not have
[1:04:38] the right receptor
[1:04:40] they did not have the right crystal as
[1:04:42] we were talking before so let's go to
[1:04:44] the fourth dimension which is the tree
[1:04:46] of knowledge or science
[1:04:49] or the fourth dimension now look the
[1:04:50] fourth dimension can't be seen
[1:04:54] but it can't be manifested okay it can't
[1:04:57] be seen you can't see the four
[1:04:58] this dimension you can see life time and
[1:05:00] matter you can see that
[1:05:02] fourth dimension is radio waves there's
[1:05:04] something moving so fast i remember i
[1:05:06] was telling it's 300 billion ohms per
[1:05:08] cycle
[1:05:09] is one of the highest ones it can just
[1:05:10] go through it can go through
[1:05:12] concrete barriers that are hundreds of
[1:05:14] feet thick they can contact submarines
[1:05:16] that are
[1:05:17] 20 miles down in the ocean because what
[1:05:19] it travels so fast it breaks through
[1:05:22] all this stuff that we got and gets
[1:05:24] right down to where it needs to go
[1:05:25] you know what that's limited man's
[1:05:28] ability what about god
[1:05:30] because god listen god uses that fourth
[1:05:34] dimension
[1:05:37] you use it all day telephone
[1:05:41] radio press play
[1:05:45] you can't see his voice
[1:05:48] you can hear it though by a receptor
[1:05:50] that picks up the voice
[1:05:52] and gives it to me and you let's look at
[1:05:53] them before now but we have contact
[1:05:55] through science the fourth dimension as
[1:05:56] it was
[1:05:57] because coming right through this
[1:05:58] building now comes pictures voices of
[1:06:00] radio
[1:06:01] pictures on television that our senses
[1:06:03] do not contact that
[1:06:04] but yet you have a tube or a crystal
[1:06:06] that picks up those ether waves and
[1:06:08] manifests them
[1:06:10] you see right in this building now is
[1:06:12] live actions of people in the air live
[1:06:14] voices they're here we know it
[1:06:16] they're absolutely the truth and the
[1:06:18] only thing you do they catch it on i
[1:06:19] don't understand the mechanics of it
[1:06:22] of these things that science has
[1:06:23] invented but we know that it proves to
[1:06:25] us
[1:06:26] there is a fourth dimension look at
[1:06:28] number five now we have no there is
[1:06:30] another dimension which is the fourth
[1:06:31] dimension
[1:06:32] because science has probed into it and
[1:06:34] found it it is radio
[1:06:36] there's no senses of our body can detect
[1:06:38] radio or television
[1:06:40] over that ether wave so see it's not
[1:06:42] your body
[1:06:44] your body is just in this dimension your
[1:06:46] body's just to hold all your guts
[1:06:47] together
[1:06:48] all right because you manifest for
[1:06:50] what's inside
[1:06:52] right through here is coming television
[1:06:54] pictures but we have nothing in us no
[1:06:57] way at all to contact that in our self
[1:06:59] it takes a crystal he keeps talking
[1:07:01] about a crystal
[1:07:02] what is that we all of us older ones we
[1:07:04] know what that is that's a piece of a
[1:07:06] diamond
[1:07:08] way back when there was a crystal a
[1:07:11] piece of a diamond a victrola needle
[1:07:15] joe pulled me up some quotes and i
[1:07:16] didn't bring it with me but i got him
[1:07:18] back there
[1:07:18] where he talks about brother brown talks
[1:07:20] about victrola needle
[1:07:22] what is it it's a diamond that's cut a
[1:07:24] certain way
[1:07:26] and only that diamond can pick up that
[1:07:28] sound
[1:07:32] sound familiar
[1:07:36] read this it takes a crystal of some
[1:07:38] sort a magnet to contact that
[1:07:40] but it speaks that there is another
[1:07:42] dimension now that's four dimensions
[1:07:44] number six enticing spirits now this
[1:07:46] morning we're going to talk about demons
[1:07:48] in spiritual form in the soul
[1:07:50] they're in the soul the same as they are
[1:07:51] in the body and we're bound to admit
[1:07:53] that we see them in people's bodies such
[1:07:55] as cancers and different diseases
[1:07:57] that's in the human body now i want you
[1:07:59] all to remember
[1:08:01] what brother brown talked about in 1955
[1:08:04] remember he interchanged soul
[1:08:06] with spirit he's talking about the
[1:08:08] spirit realm
[1:08:09] if you're born again you don't have
[1:08:11] demons in your soul
[1:08:13] if you're sick today if you even if you
[1:08:15] had the worst cancer in the world
[1:08:16] it's not in your soul okay
[1:08:19] it's in your it's in from contacting
[1:08:21] your spirit realm
[1:08:22] and then what it manifests in your body
[1:08:25] everybody got that
[1:08:26] okay talk about demons in spirit form in
[1:08:29] the soul so we mean spirit
[1:08:31] they're in the spirit the same as they
[1:08:32] are in the body and we're bound to admit
[1:08:34] that we see them in people's bodies such
[1:08:36] as cancers and different diseases
[1:08:38] that's in the human body just recently
[1:08:40] even cancer has been declared to be a
[1:08:42] fourth
[1:08:42] dimension disease listen all demons
[1:08:44] travel in the fourth dimension
[1:08:46] that's the part they travel that's the
[1:08:48] door that was opened
[1:08:51] amen that let them in but remember god's
[1:08:54] got to come through there too
[1:08:56] then it's another dimension sure it's
[1:08:58] demonology every disease
[1:09:00] every disease he didn't say just cancer
[1:09:02] every disease is a fourth dimension
[1:09:04] disease
[1:09:05] the beginning of it now let's read
[1:09:06] number seven
[1:09:09] real quick questions and answers on the
[1:09:10] seals
[1:09:12] this is the one where part of that that
[1:09:13] i was reading today
[1:09:15] don't try to make yourself odd to be a
[1:09:17] christian because you see you take
[1:09:18] yourself away from god now what's he
[1:09:20] doing he's
[1:09:20] he's went through six seals wake up
[1:09:26] he's went through six seals and he's
[1:09:28] getting ready to preach seven seal and
[1:09:29] he has questions and answers
[1:09:31] he knows they're not getting it right
[1:09:33] okay he knows they're not getting it
[1:09:35] because of the questions they asked
[1:09:36] about pantyhose and pajamas to bed
[1:09:39] when he's supposed to be answering
[1:09:40] nothing asking no questions but on the
[1:09:42] seals he said that about three times
[1:09:44] no question only stick and should women
[1:09:47] cut her hair should women wear pajamas
[1:09:48] to bed
[1:09:49] you know what he had a whole lot more
[1:09:52] patience than i did
[1:09:53] he answered every one of them and took
[1:09:55] the whole time to answer
[1:09:57] every one of them okay just saying
[1:10:01] don't try to make yourself odd to be a
[1:10:02] christian because you see you take
[1:10:03] yourself away from god
[1:10:05] if you can understand it this is that
[1:10:07] third pull
[1:10:09] you should have caught that the other
[1:10:10] day you remember there's no
[1:10:12] impersonation like there is was of the
[1:10:14] other two see
[1:10:15] the first and second pool so that's as
[1:10:18] far as you should know
[1:10:19] now just remember that you see now
[1:10:21] there's something taking place
[1:10:23] in this room
[1:10:27] and there's something here there's
[1:10:29] actual in this room look watch what he
[1:10:31] says
[1:10:32] angels voice
[1:10:35] of god amen you know what he's telling
[1:10:39] them he said if you can hear what i'm
[1:10:40] saying it's god speaking to you
[1:10:44] straight to you not through somebody
[1:10:45] else just speaking straight to you
[1:10:47] to get the revelation and they didn't
[1:10:49] get it
[1:10:51] but how do you you can't if you can't
[1:10:54] hear the natural voice look
[1:10:56] if you can't hear the natural voice
[1:10:57] without something to send it out
[1:10:59] how are you going to hear the spiritual
[1:11:00] voice wow
[1:11:02] he cut them to the bone and they didn't
[1:11:04] even know it
[1:11:06] he yeah he but he was gracious
[1:11:10] that was a gracious man to do that
[1:11:11] because he knew it wasn't for them
[1:11:12] because later on he'll tell you
[1:11:14] it's gone from you it's not even for you
[1:11:16] all right for
[1:11:17] that group of people but it is for us
[1:11:19] now you might make me
[1:11:20] make believe that somebody is singing
[1:11:23] this certain song that might not even be
[1:11:25] there see
[1:11:26] but when it actually strikes the crystal
[1:11:28] there he is again
[1:11:30] that it's supposed to strike what's he
[1:11:32] telling him the right crystal's not
[1:11:34] there yet
[1:11:36] that's what he's saying because if it
[1:11:40] had been there
[1:11:41] they would have heard the voice of god
[1:11:43] and they would have got the revelation
[1:11:46] that's why he said it wasn't for them
[1:11:47] when it strikes the crystal that it's
[1:11:49] supposed to strike
[1:11:51] then it gives a true interpretation
[1:11:55] and vindicates it by showing the picture
[1:11:58] see what i mean now the spirit of god
[1:12:00] when it speaks through the two word
[1:12:02] true word it vindicates itself to show
[1:12:05] itself that it's right
[1:12:07] you understand now all right
[1:12:11] what was he telling them the right
[1:12:12] crystal's not here yet
[1:12:14] you've got a crystal you have picked up
[1:12:17] the voice of god you need for your day
[1:12:19] you've picked up that you need the
[1:12:20] baptism of the holy ghost you picked up
[1:12:22] that you need to live right
[1:12:23] that you need to try maybe to go up the
[1:12:25] statue of perfect man but these seals
[1:12:26] are not open to you
[1:12:29] but where are the crystals
[1:12:36] i'm one okay i'm one y'all can leave
[1:12:39] your hand down all you want leave your
[1:12:40] hand no leave your hand down cause you
[1:12:41] don't believe it
[1:12:44] i'm one of those crystals i was
[1:12:47] three years old i was still sucking a
[1:12:49] battle
[1:12:51] but you know what i had representation
[1:12:55] so did you some of your parents weren't
[1:12:57] even born in 1963.
[1:12:58] but you had representation that the
[1:13:00] right crystal was coming
[1:13:02] and it would be here tonight
[1:13:06] if you don't get excited by that then
[1:13:07] this there's just really nothing
[1:13:09] if you don't see how that absolutely if
[1:13:12] you don't see predestination right
[1:13:14] though your head will be this big
[1:13:17] i was just always something ain't no way
[1:13:19] i can get out of it i'm just
[1:13:21] right here i was born and bred for it
[1:13:24] you be careful because i was born in sin
[1:13:29] i was a sinner doomed and on my way to
[1:13:32] hell but you know what god give me an
[1:13:34] angel because back before time
[1:13:39] he saw me want it right he saw me in
[1:13:42] 1997 he
[1:13:43] he saw me want it i was done with all
[1:13:46] them other things i was
[1:13:48] dealing with i would had been successful
[1:13:50] i had
[1:13:51] wonderful wife still more wonderful now
[1:13:53] than ever
[1:13:55] a couple of kids and i i didn't have a
[1:13:57] grandkid yet yes that girl up with me
[1:14:01] but you know what i didn't have jesus
[1:14:03] christ
[1:14:06] but there was a crystal that came to me
[1:14:10] about six months later hopkinsville
[1:14:14] kentucky where i'm going to
[1:14:15] uh this weekend on lake malone
[1:14:18] when god filled me with the holy ghost
[1:14:21] he brought that crystal sure i could
[1:14:22] hear
[1:14:23] i could hear the different voices i i
[1:14:25] could tell you about serpent seed i knew
[1:14:26] that what happened in the garden you
[1:14:28] didn't have to tell me but
[1:14:29] brother braham said that's just the
[1:14:30] ability to read
[1:14:32] i can read where it says repent and be
[1:14:34] baptized in the name of jesus christ for
[1:14:36] the remission of your sin
[1:14:37] that wasn't something that just got
[1:14:38] added after you got born again
[1:14:41] why it always was there
[1:14:44] and then when that always was crystal
[1:14:48] met you at your day of your new birth
[1:14:51] the two omnipotents met
[1:14:55] oh come on people brother brown said
[1:14:58] when two omnipotents meet
[1:15:00] when that holy ghost that come from the
[1:15:02] mind of god and come down and filled you
[1:15:04] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:15:06] you got a crystal inserted inside of you
[1:15:08] that nobody else gets that kind of
[1:15:10] crystal
[1:15:11] because that crystal might not be a
[1:15:13] preacher crystal
[1:15:16] it might be a teacher that crystal might
[1:15:18] be just a good housewife that crystal
[1:15:20] might be just a good guy with a
[1:15:22] lunch box under his arm going to work
[1:15:25] sitting in the pew and unlike some of
[1:15:27] you say amen
[1:15:35] i mean you know you gave me a lot of
[1:15:36] other things amen what we say
[1:15:41] but look now the spirit of god when it
[1:15:42] speaks through what the true word
[1:15:44] see now your your crystal though is set
[1:15:46] for the true word
[1:15:49] that's why when you hear faults and when
[1:15:51] you hear error
[1:15:52] what happens something goes off
[1:15:56] in other words that in other words that
[1:15:58] whatever comes from that other dimension
[1:16:00] the true word of god is in here
[1:16:03] planted and then you hear something
[1:16:05] coming from a different direction
[1:16:07] and it hits your crystal and you know
[1:16:09] what happens
[1:16:10] you know what happens when when you you
[1:16:12] turn the dial and the old am ready
[1:16:14] radio what'd you get if you didn't get a
[1:16:16] station
[1:16:19] that's all you got static that's what it
[1:16:21] is it's static you can't understand what
[1:16:23] he's saying
[1:16:25] that's why when bob was preaching that i
[1:16:26] was i was having a
[1:16:29] hallelujah time that's what the holy
[1:16:31] ghost is for that's your crystal
[1:16:34] and it's a crystal that he gave just you
[1:16:38] it was cut out of the big stone
[1:16:42] not made by hands
[1:16:46] all right now just for a minute we're
[1:16:48] going to cover
[1:16:50] the fifth dimension which is hell
[1:16:54] now remember as we said before most
[1:16:57] people
[1:16:58] think hell is burning at the moment it
[1:17:00] is not
[1:17:01] there is no such thing as a burning hell
[1:17:03] at the moment
[1:17:04] okay it's the fifth dimension and we're
[1:17:06] going to read it right here look
[1:17:08] number eight present stage of my
[1:17:09] ministry brother brown says now the
[1:17:10] fifth dimension is where the sinner
[1:17:12] the unbeliever dies and goes to the
[1:17:14] fifth dimension is kind of well
[1:17:16] the horrible dimension now this man when
[1:17:19] a christian dies he goes into the sixth
[1:17:21] dimension
[1:17:22] and god is in the seventh dimension now
[1:17:24] then you see the christian when he dies
[1:17:26] he goes under the altar of god
[1:17:28] right into the presence of god under the
[1:17:30] altar and he is at rest
[1:17:33] now at this time brother brown's already
[1:17:34] been across the curtain of time because
[1:17:36] it was 1960 when the cross occurred in
[1:17:37] time so he knows what he's talking about
[1:17:40] paragraph 25 to break it down when a man
[1:17:43] has a nightmare
[1:17:44] he's not altogether asleep neither is he
[1:17:46] awake he's between sleep and awake and
[1:17:48] that's what makes him have a horrible
[1:17:50] shaking and screaming how many of you
[1:17:52] have a nightmare
[1:17:54] can you imagine not waking up from the
[1:17:55] most horrible nightmare you've ever had
[1:17:58] and it just keeps reliving it over and
[1:18:00] over and over again like brother brown
[1:18:01] said there's no
[1:18:02] there's no foundation it just keeps you
[1:18:04] just keep dropping
[1:18:06] to break it down when a man has a
[1:18:08] nightmare he's not all together asleep
[1:18:09] and he's awake he's in
[1:18:10] he's between sleep and awake and that's
[1:18:12] what makes him have a horrible shaking
[1:18:14] and screaming
[1:18:15] because he's not asleep he's not awake
[1:18:17] to that shows where a man goes when he
[1:18:19] dies unconverted
[1:18:21] he's lived his time up he's dead on
[1:18:24] earth
[1:18:24] and he cannot go into the presence of
[1:18:26] god because he's not fit to go there
[1:18:28] without the blood and he's caught he
[1:18:31] cannot come back to earth because his
[1:18:32] time is finished here on earth
[1:18:34] and he's caught between and he's in a
[1:18:35] nightmare scene he can't go in the
[1:18:37] presence of god to rest
[1:18:39] he can't back come back to earth because
[1:18:41] his time's up he's in a nightmare and
[1:18:43] there he stays
[1:18:46] like cain until the day of judgment
[1:18:50] a horrible thing to be in number nine
[1:18:52] the countdown then i think the fifth
[1:18:54] dimension is where the sinner dies where
[1:18:56] he goes
[1:18:57] now i think that when the sinner dies he
[1:18:58] goes into this fourth dimension eight
[1:19:01] you know he means fifth notice the first
[1:19:04] thing he cannot go into the presence of
[1:19:05] god because he's a sinner his time's up
[1:19:07] on earth
[1:19:08] if i could type it for you it's like
[1:19:09] trying to go to sleep when you're in a
[1:19:10] can't be asleep
[1:19:12] you're in a nightmare hideous things
[1:19:13] you're screaming you're just
[1:19:15] all that's the state of the wicked dead
[1:19:17] he cannot go into the presence of god
[1:19:18] because he's a sinner
[1:19:19] he cannot return back to earth because
[1:19:21] his time's up
[1:19:23] and he's caught between the two things
[1:19:25] in the fifth dimension he's got a soul
[1:19:27] and he cannot go in the presence of god
[1:19:29] because it's not covered by the blood
[1:19:30] he's a sinner he cannot wake himself
[1:19:32] up because his time's up on earth so
[1:19:34] there he is in a tormented
[1:19:36] nightmare it's just because we're told
[1:19:39] because the two consciouses are passing
[1:19:41] sub and first conscious and it catches
[1:19:42] between
[1:19:43] and that's the nightmare when a sinner
[1:19:45] dies he's caught with a soul between
[1:19:46] earth and hell
[1:19:47] in a nightmare there he stands let's
[1:19:50] read first peter 3 verse 18
[1:19:52] says for christ also hath once suffered
[1:19:55] for sin the just for the unjust that he
[1:19:57] might bring us to god
[1:19:58] being put to death in the flesh but
[1:20:00] quickened by the spirit by which also he
[1:20:03] went and preached unto
[1:20:04] the spirits in prison because remember
[1:20:06] he walked down there to the spirits in
[1:20:07] prison they weren't burning
[1:20:09] they were in hell but they weren't
[1:20:11] burning he went down there and talked to
[1:20:13] the devil
[1:20:14] talked to preach to the souls that were
[1:20:15] in prison which sometimes were
[1:20:17] disobedient which once the
[1:20:18] long-suffering of god waited in the days
[1:20:20] of noah
[1:20:20] while the ark was prepared when few that
[1:20:22] his eight souls
[1:20:24] were saved by water in other words eight
[1:20:25] souls went across seven million and
[1:20:27] seven
[1:20:28] billion people died
[1:20:31] they say it's as it was in the days of
[1:20:33] noah so so it is today
[1:20:35] so there were seven billion people died
[1:20:37] and they're all down in this one place
[1:20:38] called hell
[1:20:39] or pla fifth dimension look at number 10
[1:20:43] souls in prison now jesus after he
[1:20:44] finished his ministry preached to those
[1:20:46] souls that were unsavable
[1:20:48] that cannot ever be saved now listen why
[1:20:51] can't you say well
[1:20:52] that seems like predestined that means
[1:20:54] he pulled them through a tube no they
[1:20:55] made a decision
[1:20:57] and he knew they would make that
[1:20:59] decision therefore he could do what he
[1:21:00] did to be a righteous judge
[1:21:02] now the bible tells us that he went and
[1:21:04] preached to the souls that were in
[1:21:05] prison that repented not
[1:21:06] when mercy was given look you say oh
[1:21:09] they didn't have a chance see it looks
[1:21:10] like they were unsavable
[1:21:12] could never be saved but look watch this
[1:21:14] when mercy was given to them
[1:21:16] they spurned it and now they're waiting
[1:21:19] for the judgment oh what a time that
[1:21:21] must have been oh i wish there was some
[1:21:23] way i would shake the world with that
[1:21:25] to let them see what the reality is
[1:21:28] souls in prison again paragraph 108 but
[1:21:31] after the days of his preaching his
[1:21:32] ministry continued on because the last
[1:21:34] group he preached to
[1:21:35] was the souls that were in hell that
[1:21:37] could not be forgiven
[1:21:38] i have clearly read that from the bible
[1:21:40] here from ii peter see he went and
[1:21:41] preached to the souls that were in
[1:21:43] prison
[1:21:43] which is hell locked up until the day of
[1:21:46] judgment because you see the judgment
[1:21:48] isn't now
[1:21:50] there's no burning hell now
[1:21:53] somebody tell you the guy is in burning
[1:21:56] hell now that's wrong
[1:21:59] and why let me ask you you see what he
[1:22:01] said
[1:22:03] because he's a righteous judge he's got
[1:22:04] to give them an opportunity to present
[1:22:07] their case
[1:22:09] if they die they go into this dimension
[1:22:11] they're in a place of holding
[1:22:12] he's got to resurrect them bring them
[1:22:14] back to the white throne judgment
[1:22:16] and be judged for the sin that they did
[1:22:18] but they got to all stand judgment
[1:22:21] that makes him a righteous judge
[1:22:24] that's wrong a judge of this earth is
[1:22:26] just enough to never condemn a man
[1:22:28] until he's brought to trial and god will
[1:22:31] never throw a man
[1:22:32] into the fiery furnace until first he is
[1:22:34] condemned by god's own
[1:22:36] laws he rejected mercy so you see he
[1:22:41] first has to have a trial
[1:22:42] and the trial is the great white throne
[1:22:44] judgment but now he's in a place called
[1:22:47] a prison house
[1:22:49] as i saw the vision of both places by
[1:22:51] the grace of god
[1:22:52] i say this not to be sacrilegious and if
[1:22:54] i'm wrong god forgive me i believe i've
[1:22:56] been in both places
[1:22:57] and i seen the redeemed the blessed i
[1:22:59] seen the lost and where they were at and
[1:23:01] that's why i stand as your brother today
[1:23:03] to warn you
[1:23:04] to flee from that downward path don't
[1:23:06] you ever go that road
[1:23:08] glorify jesus let's read this one and
[1:23:10] then we'll then we'll stop right here
[1:23:13] say here is a line like this and then
[1:23:15] there's all mortals
[1:23:17] on this side or that side men are
[1:23:18] influenced by one side
[1:23:20] this side comes from god this side comes
[1:23:23] from the devil
[1:23:24] now let's just take it a great
[1:23:26] conglomeration of blackness anxiety and
[1:23:29] muck and sin
[1:23:30] and divisiveness of this world every
[1:23:32] once in a while you'll see a little
[1:23:34] white spot
[1:23:35] that's a christian like a light now
[1:23:38] those that are in darkness are
[1:23:40] influenced from beneath
[1:23:41] those that are lights are influenced
[1:23:43] from above now when you leave either one
[1:23:45] of these channels
[1:23:47] in other words when you leave this world
[1:23:49] or any one of these channels you go into
[1:23:51] the realm of spirit
[1:23:52] this is the mortal realm the dimension
[1:23:54] that we live in now
[1:23:56] because see the fifth the fourth
[1:23:57] dimension fifth dimension the sixth
[1:23:58] dimension are all different worlds
[1:24:00] okay now if you go this way listen close
[1:24:04] if you go this way the first dimension
[1:24:06] is the spirit of the dead now remember
[1:24:08] you got to remember he's in that fifth
[1:24:10] dimension
[1:24:11] telling you there's a dimension inside
[1:24:13] of a dimension because the first
[1:24:14] dimension is clearly not
[1:24:16] hell sometimes we may think that it is
[1:24:19] but the first three dimensions are time
[1:24:22] light and matter
[1:24:23] but the first dimension in the spirit
[1:24:26] world
[1:24:26] is the spirit of the dead peter spoke of
[1:24:29] it in prison that repented not by the
[1:24:30] long suffering of the days of noah the
[1:24:32] wicked unregenerated man when he dies
[1:24:34] his spirit goes into this realm look the
[1:24:36] next round below that is demons
[1:24:38] the next round below that is hell so
[1:24:41] there's different
[1:24:42] stages even in the fifth dimension
[1:24:46] where are you going to put the foolish
[1:24:47] virgin where are you going to put the
[1:24:48] cup of water in my name you're going to
[1:24:49] put them in a different place because
[1:24:50] they're not going to be in that place i
[1:24:52] don't think
[1:24:52] that's he said that's the unsaved people
[1:24:54] the people that are unsavable
[1:24:57] in other words they've already made
[1:24:58] their choice so they're unsavable but
[1:25:00] that's your fifth fourth and fifth
[1:25:01] dimension
[1:25:02] let's stand to our feet musicians come
[1:25:06] and we'll look next time we speak we'll
[1:25:08] talk about the sixth dimension we know
[1:25:10] more about it than any of it
[1:25:12] because we have a connection to it
[1:25:15] because that's the holy ghost if you got
[1:25:17] the holy ghost you got part of it here
[1:25:19] that's why you go there the reason they
[1:25:22] the reason the the unsavable don't go
[1:25:24] there is they have no
[1:25:25] connection they have no part
[1:25:29] their parts down here they've lived
[1:25:31] their time
[1:25:33] listen if you're not saved tonight you
[1:25:34] better check yourself
[1:25:36] i just told you this is real this is not
[1:25:38] something fairy tale
[1:25:40] exactly you're going everybody's going
[1:25:43] to have to give an account
[1:25:45] about what they do except they're
[1:25:47] redeemed and we're still going to have
[1:25:49] to give an account of some of the things
[1:25:50] that we do as christians because
[1:25:52] sometimes we a little
[1:25:53] need a little slap on the hand but it's
[1:25:54] not to put us in this hell
[1:25:57] it's not to put us in this fifth
[1:25:58] dimension but if you die tonight and you
[1:26:01] don't have the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:26:03] that's where you're going and you're
[1:26:06] going to stay there
[1:26:07] until the judgment happens and guess
[1:26:09] what
[1:26:10] the dead lived not for a thousand years
[1:26:12] you've got an extra thousand years
[1:26:16] that you're gonna have to stay dead
[1:26:18] because we're gonna be redeemed we're
[1:26:20] gonna rise and we're going to walk
[1:26:22] through that dimension
[1:26:24] and all the sinner dead's got to stay
[1:26:26] dead for another thousand years past
[1:26:28] until the white throne judgment but
[1:26:31] thank god he's give us a hiding place
[1:26:33] he's give us a place we can go
[1:26:37] and if you've already went there you're
[1:26:39] very familiar with it that's why my
[1:26:40] brother brandon went across the curtain
[1:26:42] of time he was pretty familiar with
[1:26:43] where he was at
[1:26:44] he was kind of had a few questions
[1:26:46] because he's looking at his cucker bear
[1:26:47] laying on the
[1:26:48] i mean looking at his body yeah brother
[1:26:50] brian was a cuckoo bird don't worry
[1:26:52] we were all huggaburst okay all born in
[1:26:55] sin
[1:26:56] there was only one wheat plant that was
[1:26:58] born a wheat plant
[1:26:59] and that was jesus christ amen everybody
[1:27:02] got that
[1:27:03] but he still had what he took on yokobur
[1:27:07] he took on your sin and died for me and
[1:27:11] you
[1:27:12] let's turn around and give it back to
[1:27:13] him let's give him the glory let's sing

[1:30:22] these angels they can move
[1:30:24] they can move through all dimensions

[1:30:34] dimensions but you know what
[1:30:36] when they come to that time when we walk
[1:30:39] down that street
[1:30:41] and we go into that city
[1:30:44] i believe they're just going out to line
[1:30:46] the streets
[1:30:48] and they're going to stand there with
[1:30:49] arms folded and they're going to shake
[1:30:50] their head
[1:30:52] and wonder what are these people singing
[1:30:54] about
[1:30:56] we don't know what we don't we never was
[1:30:59] went through any of that
[1:31:00] we didn't have a a bill that we missed
[1:31:03] or a
[1:31:04] job interview that we didn't get or or
[1:31:08] just think about anything in life that's
[1:31:11] part of redemption
[1:31:13] your life is a part of the plan of god
[1:31:16] your whole life you saw when i was a
[1:31:18] sinner yeah that was part of it
[1:31:21] it gives you purpose amen and as brother
[1:31:24] brown says it gives god purpose to have
[1:31:26] this kind of plan
[1:31:28] and the plan that he had was to include
[1:31:30] me and you
[1:31:32] and each one of us have that crystal
[1:31:34] inside of us if you're born again
[1:31:35] tonight you have that crystal
[1:31:37] that receptor that you can receive from
[1:31:39] god where the guy sitting beside you
[1:31:41] cannot or the lady sitting beside you at
[1:31:43] the
[1:31:43] grocery store on an airplane or on a bus
[1:31:46] and they're just thinking about all the
[1:31:47] evil stuff and all the howard
[1:31:49] second wife and third husband and all
[1:31:51] this different stuff and here you're
[1:31:53] sitting there going
