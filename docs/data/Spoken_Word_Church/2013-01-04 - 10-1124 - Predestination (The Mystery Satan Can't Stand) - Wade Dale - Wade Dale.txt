just shook the hand of God on the face of the Earth amen kind of shocked him a little bit out in Kansas when we did that but that's okay we need to be shocked every once in a while need to have a little joke maybe some of us need to have an electrode stuck to us somewhere if you got your Bibles let's turn in the book of Jeremiah and read a scripture got a little thought on the plane going out last Saturday and uh wrote a few things down I didn't have a thing to speak at brother claud's and this little thought came to my heart so we'll uh see how the Lord leads here um Ever every sermon is the same but every sermon is different and you preach the same sermon in five different places and go at it five different ways you know you can get to New York by by I 95 or 81 or 82 or so you can get you can get to a lot of different things a lot of different ways tonight we're going to look at the thought predestination the mystery Satan can't stand right let's bow our heads before we start dear heavenly father we pray Lord that you would come Among Us in a special way not be Lord just a bystander but be an active participant in the service father that you would take total preeminence and that you would be the one that does the speaking father not be a man Lord but be you Lord taking this word that is truly before the foundation of the world that's that's tried and tested and true and bring it to the hearts of the people father we ask you that you just bless us now as the pilgrims long time ago sat down tomorrow Lord with with the Indians and and bless the food of the the Bountiful Harvest that they had and thank you Lord for a new country that they had moved to well father we're moving to another country not this United States of America father but we're moving to a country a kingdom that you've set up without hammering nails that you promised Lord that you would come back and get us that you would build this place father we believe that you're building it now in the heart of the believer not up in heaven somewhere fixing something up but you're fixing up the hearts and minds of the Believers so that we can be the part of that City father we pray that You' just touch each one if there's any sick here Lord you said you sent your word and healed them and delivered them from destruction so Lord as the word Goes Forth May the eyes of the Holy Spirit just smooth things over may they people be blessed Lord by just being here father may we be blessed just by reading your word be with the ones that are not here that are traveling the ones that are homesick father we ask you just touch them now father just be with us and bless us and keep us forgive us of our many sins and our mistakes we ask these things in Jesus name amen the book of Jeremiah 1 verse 5 before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee right wow and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations right then said I oh Lord God behold I cannot speak for I'm a child but the Lord said unto me say not I am a child for Thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee look at those eyes before I form thee in the belly I I knew Thee I I I who's doing all this God Jeremiah didn't have one thing to do with it amen and whatsoever I command thee Thou shalt speak now let's turn to Romans 9 just get another another part of the thought Romans 9:13 and then you may be seated as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated right you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to reading of his word now folks God is not a respector of persons but it looks like in these two scriptures Brother Ray that God is a respector of person that he actually picked these people before they even breathed the breath of air they were chosen to do a job God had already wrote in his word what was going to happen there wasn't one thing had to do with it Jeremiah or Esau or Jacob but the Bible says God is not a respector person amen now tonight we're going to remember brother random said the word predestination was not a good word to use in the congregation maybe he said in a congregation he was trying to say that was a little unlearned but I think we're sitting in a congregation that's a little bit learning so let's talk about predestination because the word predestination means that your destiny was determined before you even got here predestined Destiny predetermined before your destiny was determined before you even got here everybody not just Jacob and Esau not just Jeremiah right so let's look at this and see and look that back before the world God knew what was going to happen happen amen all right now but Satan was there but Satan was not in the mind of God right so we're going to we're going to speak a little bit and then try to put two services in one to get to the point but this is the mystery Satan can't stand he can't stand how how that God has already picked you chose you stamped you and put you already in the future home hold on just a minute but God is not a respector of persons he can't say I pick Timothy and don't pick brother deck right so how can he predetermine that all this was going to happen before we got here when we say all that's for knowledge oh well that's true amen but I thought God's thoughts were Eternal and cannot change right so predestination is like this a line I got something thank you predestination is a line God cannot change his mind about what he's already said God cannot go back on his word God cannot go back on what he's already saw because what he saw is eternal right amen so that's why I think brother brandom was trying to get it to the people that predestination is not a real bad word if you know what you're talking about right all right but now predestination in a in a in a in a baby form is Brother Gary it's it's more like you say there's nothing I can do about it God just knew I was going to you know be a sinner all my life you know it always bothered me that that that I could see how God could could take Adolf Hitler and if he gave Adolf Hitler a million years he'd never repent exactly he could give him 2 million years he'd never repent right he'd give him 3 million years he'd never repent exactly so Adolf Hitler done what he did and went off the scene and God knew that's exactly what he's going to do he knew Adolf Hitler would never ever ask for forgiveness never would come to the knowledge he may come to the knowledge of God but not to the very Mind Of God cuz that's what we're going to try to get to that's the mystery Satan can't stand Brother D he can't get into the mind of God right even the prophet told us one time he said if I speak it watch Satan he'll try to copy oh yeah but he said but if I keep it in my mind or Heart Right heart not in this thumping gizard heart right here but in my heart in the heart of my being right okay if I can keep it right here Satan won't do can't do anything about it well what about God God's got secrets in his mind that he wrote us a letter and tonight across the country if they're having services in the Baptist and the Methodist and the Presbyterians and the Catholics and Brites or whatever right you want to claim same words right and they can preach predestination is that God did choose one and didn't choose the other yeah or they can do like some do and say well it's already pre-planned there's nothing I can do about it I'm just going to go right on through with it but what about a prophet that came and gave us this book or we're talking about tonight we're talking about the perfect will of God because the perfect will of God will never change that's that line that will never change the perfect will of God will never waver it will never falter but now the permissive will of God is what you and I work in a lot of times and that's not the string that you pull across that we call eternity because that's the things listen to this this came to my mind I think while I was on the on the plane but the way for me to understand the perfect will or the permissive will of God is write this down or put it in your mind the perfect will of God he saw it would happen right the permissive will of God let it happen yeah right by your choice exactly the perfect will of God God saw it would happen standing in eternity he saw this was going to happen tonight just this same cting but in permissive will he let it happen by one thing and that's your choice right right exactly so perfect will of God is never going to change right God don't change his mind about his word I was looking up in the back we talk about will brother Dick's going to like this one when I tell him but remember we say well the perfect will of God we say what is what is Will well it's a desire if it's a if it's a verb or if it's a a noun it is the word of somebody or what somebody desires or something that's going to be said that's going to be done but listen to this we always say the perfect will of God or the permissive will of God but have you ever looked at the will of God as a document Y what is a will right right a will is a legal description of a person's wishes regarding the disposal of his or her property yeah or estate after his death that's why the prophet could say that God's will is his word yeah not just that he will it to happen he wrote us a will amen he wrote us this will that's right and out of this will after he died come on had to be the death of a testator right had somebody had to die to give you a will right now this is the perfect will of God right the perfect will written right of God right and I looked up the word self will you know what the word self-will mean Bullhead yeah told you bullheaded but brother randam said there was either what 5 cents is outside 5 cents is the next Rim one cents in the middle Rim which is what self will right bullheaded yeah one way or the other right you can be bullheaded for God or you can be bullheaded for Satan right but we look at well a little bit different way though we say well okay this is the perfect will of God this is the way it's going to happen this is the way God sees it and it is it's his purpose and it is eternal because it is his word this Bible was written brother Bram said your name was written before the foundation of the world so guess what in a in a in an eternal sense it's done and over with finished Paul picks it up and says sitting in Heavenly places because if you go to work long enough you'll realize one thing you're not sitting in Heavenly places down here but everybody's Destiny is determine before they get here but now the perfect will of God is the standard right Eternal cannot change the permissive will of God is what we do with this that's right they understand that the perfect will of God is this but what we do with it right is the permissive will of God right God permits us right he actually permits the Baptist to preach a sermon out of this book right Methodist bramit whoever right but there's only one Mind Of God right one right and it's not a Baptist Faith or a Methodist Faith or a bromite faith you understand what I'm saying putting everything together right it's what he said and saw would happen right hey brother Tom how you doing buddy appreciate that song I knew that's what she was going to sing I asked brother boy didn't get you saying and I knew that's what you going to saying but we were guilty we we were guilty but we were guilty by this right here but what did we do we picked up the will one day read where that if you'll accept the death of something sure see if Daddy died and had a will for me unless I go accept that will right right right unless I go accept that will it'll lay there for centuries amen and nobody can touch it right but if you say okay I claim because I am the son of I am the daughter of come on if I can prove my lineage my genealogy that's what's happening to us now amen we're proving our genealogy that's right right whether we're going to lean toward Mama and Daddy on the Earth our mom and daddy in heaven right perfect will of God Amen but it's all going to work back to this perfect will but in permissive will we can work around in here a little bit let me read you a quote brother R says I'm not going to read all these cuz I read them for two services but we'll skip through some of them brother Brown said does God change his mind 1965 427 so we really believe that God never changes his mind about what he said yeah he always keeps it true but he has a permissive will now there where the trouble lay we try to work on God's permissive will and he will permit it yes but also if we take his permissive will though it's not right he will make his permissive will to work together to glorify his perfect will glory right in other words he's going to let us have permissive will but it's always going to work back to this right here all right so you got your perfect will God let it drop down because of the fall and the things that we've done wrong and he's letting us Roll Along in a permissive will but it's going to always go right back up to the perfect will of almighty God if you hook yourself to that if you become part of the family right we know we can write wheels for people that's not in the family but but let's get it right right brother dick I have absolutely if he were to pass away you know here I go right in the middle of Brad Laur and all them here I go sitting down right in the middle of a whole thing I know you wouldn't you might dick wouldn't like for me to get his money but here I am sitting in front of the judge though I know she's got it all look how I finish my point so I'm sitting here in this room with all these Addison and I'm a Dale right and the judge looks at me and goes what are you doing here I said well I knew brother dick I went to church with him for 20 years roding his car he and him me and him kind of think Al like a little bit judge said that's good anything else no he said well I don't see your name in the whe right I I don't see you were a part of the don't take me out if fam um I don't see him in the in the will why cuz I wasn't a part of his family right I wasn't part of his family exactly so I have no right in claim to anything that brother dick has exactly because I'm not in the will that brother dick made amen right do you understand that exactly and that's the same way with the rest of us if we're not if we don't hook oursel to the right family get the right genealogy right this becomes a judgment book right oh my right because remember permissive is always going to work to the perfect will of God right out here at the end we're going back to that same line again everybody understand that it's not a different line that started here God thought it he knew it he loved Jacob and hated Esau right he loved Jeremiah he knew what Isaiah was going to do made it available for for them and they accepted it Jacob took it Esau turned it down God saw it so now just keep that in mind God's word is always Eternal it's all in the Bible everything in this Bible is predestinated right all right but now he's not going to make you do it let's read Romans 9 while we're right here at 9:13 because um as you've seen Paul's writings he he brings out a thought and then he finishes it so in verse 13 he saying as written Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated Paul didn't leave it there Paul explained why right verse 19 to save time thou will say then unto me why do he yet find fault right for who hath resisted his will nay but oh man who art thou that repliest against God right Cain did remember Cain did right Cain said am I my Brother's Keeper right shall the thing formed he's talking about he's still keeping the thought of Jacob and Esau right shall the thing form say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus right somewhere people like it or not God's going to come to every person in the world and tell them the time and the day that he tried to get them to become part of this well exactly because if not he'd be a respector of persons that's right now we know that the little babies that's why praise God that the prophet could could tell us that that babies before the age of accountability why they have nothing to go on Amen they're automatically in the will right you thought of all I thought of that sister Gil a long time you know about the how many little babies have died we think boy Heaven's going to be so empty Heaven's going to be full this Earth is going to be full the Bible says full it won't be overflowing everybody will have their place but it will be full right CU think of all the babies down through the centuries of time that's died that will be given eternal life there in heaven so so it's not going to be that we going to have to search out and look for somebody no it's going to be full right but listen we bring in a little word called election because we have to bring election in because of one thing God is not a respector a person right and by election he said we'll we'll read it in a few minutes and we're going heading toward Ephesians you know should know that by now but God has set up a a thing called an election we just went through one correct what did you do when you went to an election you cast it a vat right all right and the prophet explains it very simple he says God voted for you the devil voted against you a two to one vote wins this thing got it right vote for this guy you going in his Direction vote for this guy you're going in his Direction so the Bible says by election election looks back we'll read it in just a few minutes God saw what you would elect to vote for who you would elect to vote for all right but now remember people God's not going to make you do anything right that's one thing God will not do he limited himself enough to know one thing that when he put Adam and Eve on free moral agency he put Satan on free moral agency right everybody's on free moral agency and I believe I got a quote somewhere where brother Brown said God was on free moral agency cuz he could choose he's got he made a choice but he makes a choice by what you choose yeah you talking about Jesus doing some things that I mean we doing things Jesus can't do there one thing God can't do he can't make you go to heaven right right he can't make you go to heaven right now before the age accountability don't get me wrong but he can if you're a same person tonight he can't just say I'm going to put you in heaven or he' be a respect your person so he has to go by your choice all right let's read another quote get through real quick but if and does God ever change his mind same same uh book but and if the people won't walk in his perfect will he does have a permissive will he will let you walk in notice he permits it all right but he will make it work out for his glory in his perfect will yeah all right number two now listen father of Abraham 1955 11:18 and predestination is a hard word word among a congregation of people because predestination really forn knowledge is a better word right and predestination looks back to forn knowledge and for knowledge looks on to Destiny that God being infinite in the beginning knew the end from the beginning therefore he knew what people would do right so he could foretell what would take place for he knew what would be therefore before Esau or Jacob either one was born God could say Esau I've hated and Jacob I've loved because he forew what they could be he never made Esau the way he was right he wasn't willing that Esau would be that way but Esau by choice God knew what would take place they what would take that way so that's how he knows us today he knows your heart you might be able to fool your neighbor you might be able to fool your pastor but you'll never be able to fool God that's right cuz he knows your heart and that's the thing about God God knowing your heart I believe believe there'll be a lot of people be giv eternal life cuz God knew remember brother Bram said you and I are going to give an account right for the people we can't get to and God won't hold that against them all right pretty tough right but that's what he said right faith of Abraham same same um book chapter paragraph E20 therefore he by election I like this one he chose Abraham now remember I don't think he just spoke just to Abraham right I think he spoke to a lot of people right Abraham's the only one that said I'll do it right that's how simple that is Mary was the only one that said in her heart right be it unto me according to Thy word now she many of them probably could have said that listen to what he said about Abraham listen to this Prophet you remember when he called him out there and said he had not keep a thing a secret from him when he was going down to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah for he said now this is not verb Adam in the Bible but listen to what brother what brother R said about it this is his quote he said from about God for I know that Abraham will teach his children Amen in other words he knew what Abraham would do with it right when God give it to him he knew what he knew that maybe maybe John Doe the the neighbor of Abraham wouldn't do that right he keep it to himself or wouldn't do but listen for I know that Abraham will teach his children I know it God himself I know that Abraham will send this message on down from one generation to the other right brother dony that's what he saw in Abraham he saw that Abraham would be the father of our faith but he would not keep it to himself but he would pass it down from generation to generation God's covenant with Abraham sou Falls South Dakota 1956 now Jesus didn't come to Calvary just for a halfhazard thought well I'll die up there perhaps maybe somebody will feel sorry for me and come down and get saved no no God don't run his office like that you don't run your office like that Jesus came for one specific purpose that was to redeem those that God forne would be redeemed right now listen brother Ram told us and it shocked the people in Bartlesville because they didn't remember the quote but dad's preached on it several times Jesus never come to give you an inheritance right exactly Jesus never came to give you an inheritance am your inheritance was before the foundation of the world Jesus just came down here to take you back to it right now I don't like that word just cuz that limits everything you know Jesus didn't just come to do that I mean come to save those that that were lost but he had a specific plan and it was not to bring you an inheritance right you're inheritance was before the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the book God just came down here to tell you you're written here somewhere in this book that we call a will but it kind of shock people when you when you when you quote that to them because they said ma'am Jesus had to come to do something exactly and let me see if I can find it he made the way exactly let me see if I can find it I'll just read it now and if I don't I'll get to it in just a minute position in Christ 1960 522 inheritance by predestination see that's what Satan can't stand he looks down here and sees us working in permissive will of God sinning doing things wrong we're humans he can't understand though that God he knows that God had some plan or he wouldn't be doing what he's doing but he's got some plan for you and I but but Satan can't understand that he's still accusing us of things right but listen inheritance by predestination position in Christ 196 522 now Joseph's got all these copies so they'll be on the internet if you need them inheritance by predestination I inherited something what inheritance there had to be somebody leaving me an inheritance why you say Jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance remember we were in to inherit eternal life that was our inheritance to live on this Earth Body Spirit and soul Eternal right right brother Gary amen I believe that 100% but remember what happened the separation came right Adam couldn't get back to God God couldn't get to Adam so it wasn't that that Adam totally lost everything the inheritance was still there right remember brother re said it wasn't that God didn't annihilate the inheritance he just took it away from Adam and said you're not going to be able to produce this will anymore I'm going to have to come and die because remember Adam couldn't die for mine and your sins right so somebody's got to die to give you a will amen right that's right so that's what God did God Jesus didn't come to to to give you a new inheritance he came to say look believe in me become part of my family and I'll give you this what my father the will of My Father which is the word of God all right beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance Jes Jesus never left you one he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance but but your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God give you your inheritance your inheritance was first right there's that line Brother D there's that line that's that perfect will of God right that I'm going to have children right I'm going to have a family and this is the way it's going to be right now we choose to get to that is where the choice comes in sure we dropped down here brother R said to make a choice right but God knew what choice he was going to make before you even got here amen Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated now let's go on through but remember we were back in God before the foundation of the world in what not in a body form no not in a in a theophany as individuals but in what God Said right right but now remember before God said it he had to think it right right I going to try to find it I'm kind of getting a littlee because I'm trying to produce two services in one but that's okay okay here we go number three God's power to transform you were in your great great great grandfather you were in the loins of your father but your father could not have any fellowship with you until you were transformed into a body of Flesh right my son there was in me I wanted a son but he was in me then he was in me then but through wedlock he was transformed into a man like me and then he became like me amen and you become like your parents CU it was in you to begin with now if you are the Son of God his attributes which you are an attribute of your father not your mother your father The Germ lays in the father now your mother was an incubator that bears you you Bears the seed of your father read on down just skip a few more um paragraphs same God's power to transformed and the Earth in flesh is also the incubator incubator that bears the seed of God not the world how great the world is is how great the god that made it Glory now if you are a son and daughter of God then you were in God at the beginning you're his attribute if you wasn't there then you never was or you never will be right keep reading now then now you can fellowship with him in other words you're you're out now you couldn't back there because you were just a word in him right right a seed Jesus said a sore the seed goes out all right what the son of man do he sowed the seed what he slded the foundation or he solded the the way for you and us to you and I to get here I'm like Daddy we went out to Kansas and we didn't have a bit of problem with our voice or or sinuses or nothing we come back home and it's got both of us but anyway praise the lord we got back so it's okay amen you couldn't back there because you were just a word and him a seed but now he's manifested in you and now he wants you to fellowship with him see the perfect Fellowship right oh my them deep mysteries of God how wonderful God could not Fellowship in spirit so God became man right Jesus Christ was God himself manifested cuz he was a son because he was begotten but it was just a tabernacle for him to live in that's right glor praise the Lord for that amen but now what can he do he can now be our brother to do what to be a brother put you in the family right right then it puts you in line for the will sometimes we look at perfect will permissive will and we look at a God that says all right that's the way it's going to be which that's true but he knows what it was before he started all right try to get back to that I know it's very very simple but we were in C germ 4 and brother brandham said God thought it and then when he spoke it it had to become material right all right so he started bringing all these things forth and guess what happened you and I were an attribute in his thoughts and if you are if you were if you're born again tonight if you're born again if you have the new birth you have that same theophany that was before the foundation of the world dwelling in your soul the very Creator folks let me tell you this is why without the new birth you can't understand these things but with the new birth I actually you can go into that very mind of the man that made this thing right and you can glean things out of this will that a lot of people are not going to ever get out of it right because let me tell you one thing this is a good point if I come and I write a book about my life yeah I can't use any of the family take brother Joe Solace he doesn't know all of my past than brother Joe Solace I write a book and I hand that book to brother Joe I'm the author yeah and it's a biography of of a true story of my life and I hand it to brother Joe and brother Joe reads it and he says oh that's a good story but if some way my personality my being my vision could be transformed into Joe Solace now when Joe Solus reads that book it's as if he lived it right but Tom that's what this book that we call a Bible is right it can be read as a good story book it can be read as just some good like brother Tom said War Stories right brother Tom it can be read to say oh somebody is over there somebody over here somebody over there but what about when the very author of the book come on takes a hold of your being not the being your Mom and Daddy brought in the world but that being inside of you that Supernatural part of you and he takes that little speck of himself and he places it in your heart right and he don't give it to you to take it away from you exct right when he gives it to you he vulcanize he takes that rubber and melts it to rubber right he takes that old Stony heart out which is made of stone and he puts a heart of Flesh and then what does God do he takes his spirit and puts it in that man now brother joose Solus can read that book and enter into the same life that the author lived right that's what we got to do people amen am amen that's what's going to get us out of here I believe that that's the only thing that's going to get us out of here because that book is read by billions and billions of people sermons are preached by billions and billions of people there's no telling how many sermons that that been preached since brother bram's been dead right just out of the 1160 sermons right of the interpretation of the Bible that's right right amen but how many interpretations they had they never entered into the heart of the composer those little stories brother Brown told was not just little stories to fill in till God give him something to say I believe that was what God was giving him to say cuz he'd say if I was bethoven tonight what would I do I'd write a symphony if I was God Almighty tonight I could understand this book right now we know we're limited by our human ability so was Jesus but he chose it that way right you and I didn't have a choice we were born this way am but we do have a choice to get back right to that part amen right right I like that amen you enter in to the very it's not that you're reading as a second person cuz remember brother Bram always said if it's two right one's God one's the devil that's right so if you read this and not get what the author was saying that's how close Christ and Antichrist is in this end time right if you can't read it in the heart of the composer that wrote it it's Antichrist it's anti- word amen cuz it's just a letter right it's just a form but you know what if we take it as a will that makes us part right if it it says on top of that will somewhere it says Dale right I'm going to be sitting at the in the lawyer's office right you couldn't stop me don't thing stop me be Church lot of you wouldn't stop you there right but we got here but now look when we got here our choice was whether to stay the son of who you were naturally born by or through right or like Jesus told Nicodemus the same sitting is you say well poor Nicodemus we all were the same way carnally we said or we just shake a hand take the right hand of Fellowship a lot of people get the left foot of Fellowship but a right hand of Fellowship that's what Nicodemus was saying if I got carnally he said if I got to go back and get in my mother's womb in other words we got to do this same birthing process over again what did Jesus say he said no he said Nicodemus you can't you're already born down here Born Again means it's the second time right right you got to be born from above right same way with you and I you say oh poor Nicodemus that's the same way you and I have a choice to stay the son of Samuel and Peggy Dale are become the son of Jesus Christ exactly all of us all right now look for knowledge we spoke a little bit about but let's go into forn knowledge just for a second because you have to bring in for knowledge or people say well God did just just pull me through a cube now let's listen Book of Exodus 1955 the word predestinate that's not a good word to use the word forn knowledge is better better you know what the word for knowledge means very simple knowledge before it happens right knowledge of what's going to happen before it happens that's simple as you can make for knowledge predestination looks back to for knowledge why God can't predestinate and be giving you a choice if he didn't go by for knowledge cuz he had to see it first therefore he could predestinate all right so predestination looks back to where he was at in for knowledge okay for knowledge looks to destination God saw your destination exactly very simple but God not making set it in order a little hole that you have to go through and can't go no other way but God in order to be God he know the end from the beginning so he could predict it and set things in order going happen where I think Pentecost failed 1955 1111 now the word is used here in the fifth verse of predestination predestinated it's not a very good word for an evangelist or minister to use because it kind of confuses the people when you say predestinate predestination speaks looks back to for knowledge for knowledge looks to destination predestination goes back to forge knowledge for knowledge goes to destination in other words God didn't say now I'll make this man be this and I'll make this man be that but in order to be God he had to know the end from the beginning right so in order to forn knowledge that he knew I'm reading this what he said he could say this would happen and that would happen because he was God and knows where everything would be placed and therefore he could ordain certain things for certain ages right you say well how in the world somewhere God saw you before the foundation of the world had to see you had to know what age you'd be and had to some way brother BR said through this one through this one breeding this one with this one this one this one this one this one to get you here no all right not of you're choosing to get here but after you got here God knew what you'd do okay Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated look Ephesians parallels Joshua predestination looks back to for knowledge I mean election election looks back to for knowledge and predestination looks to Destiny don't forget that election looks back here here it is I was a cucklebur I was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies now this quote right here a lot of people can't stand right they hate this quote because brother Bram said I was an eagle I always was an eagle I always was this eternal life or this seed or whatever but listen to this I was a cuckle bar right I was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies born among Sinners father and mother and all my whole family were Sinners right I was a cucklebur right but all of a sudden I became a wheat Jour amen I thought God's power to transform did that yeah I became a wheat grain how did it happen what was it election God knew what you choose was an election you're choosing an officer to fill a position right you elect him because you vote more votes for this guy than you do for this guy like I said you voted you know God voted for you devil voted against you you swing the vote God before the foundation of the world elected that that c was to become a grain of wheat by for knowledge he seen that I would love him so he made a pritu through his own son that through him I might become from a cleur to a grain of wheat we were all born in sin going in One Direction Right Prophet priest our King doesn't matter it's like brother Ryan asked uh here tonight ask in the Bible study that how it looked that that God did um was a respector persons by telling brother Brandon before he even begin to to to come to a knowledge of anything he said told Brother Brom he said now don't smoke Don't drink don't defile your body right you'd think well boy he if he done that to me maybe I'd be different no or he would have sorry that's just the way God is no sorry you say boy if I was back there when Jesus was crucified no you'd have been just the rest of them exactly that's why God had you in this age to believe this all right but brother Ryan said that looked more like a respected person but daddy said in great wisdom he said well son he was not protecting William brandham he was protecting the gift right because look brother brandham picked up the bottle it wasn't that he said I never done those things I never smoked never drank never defile my body no he picked the cigarette up and was going to smoke it he picked the bottle up and was going to drink it right he said I was going to drink it right he said I was going to kill them boys I was going to kill that man that pour in my dog right I put a gun to my head to commit suicide right I was going to do those things he didn't say I thought about doing them he said I was going to do them exactly but God protected the gift that the a man had he had to Glory cuz that gift had to come but it came through that man because it molded itself together same way with you and I I got a quote here brother bam said said God knew he said he didn't just make you a preacher because he want just to fill a place right he knew you could handle certain things he knew others couldn't handle certain things that's why it's not a it's not a shame to not be a everybody wants to be a preacher everybody wants to be preacher why why yeah I'd love to come in 5 minutes before the service starts or later and sit in the front Pew and just say praise the Lord can't do that right I can't do that right I'm constantly thinking about you people amen constantly thinking about all the people I go speak for constantly just thinking about now God knows I don't 24 hours a day I don't think about it I'm sorry got a job got kids and the family you know but I do it's on my mind right you know what does the people need right I wish I could go home and lay down at night and just say Lord bless them I can't do that cuz we all got problems we all got things that we got to deal with but God by for knowledge knew that you know you somebody people say well how can you handle things like brother Dale he how do he handles things maybe different than I do and there's some things I disagree that he that he handles but I see telling me from his face but I'm not the boss right I'm just the secretary come on it's like Claud said Claud said if I want to talk he called me he said where's your daddy at I said well he so and so and so and so I said what do you need he said well I need to ask him a question and I started to say one time I said well just ask you know I ask me I'll see if I can answer it he said I don't want to talk to the secretary he said I want to talk to the boss I said okay I give his number don't call me back dick he just knows we're highly opinionated he may listen to this but that's okay but listen God had us in his mind right knew what age we would fit in there's no other age we could be a lot of us would be scared cowards if we were in that fourth age we may not have made it oh that's right come on people we may not have made it right but God put us in this age to do a certain thing that's what I want to get to I'm going to skip a little bit and get down to right here let's go to Romans no let's don't let's let's forget that we got to get through well it's just 8:15 Lord yall who got to get go to work tomorrow Sarah you can slip out if you need to and sister Trudy if you nod your head fall asleep that's okay the rest of us don't have to get up in the morning praise the Lord so we can go on a little bit further can we do that Romans 8 you love the Lord amen I do too love you guys too miss you while we were gone sure did Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them are who are the called according to his purpose see we were called according to his purpose not our purpose right we were called according to his purpose he called and we answered his purpose he didn't call and we answered our own purpose right those he may have called did and they didn't respond like Abraham's time he probably asked a bunch of people hey would you must believe me and probably a lot of people said no probably a lot of people had other things to do but listen to this excuse me for whom he did Forno in other words he had to know you before that's what forn knowledge is for them whom he did for know he also did predestinate there's the key right set in stone but your name's not right there unless you believe it's right there right exactly you make the choice to put yourself in this scripture right here right see because way Dale's not right here but I can say I am because why he also did predestin to be conformed right right not to the image of the son of Samuel and pegy day right right but it said the image of his son right that he might be the first born among many many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate ly drawn Eternal no way you can get out of it why moreover whom he did predestinate them he called right right and whom he called right not Mama call and daddy sent they like that Daddy was in Barbersville and they really got a chuckle out of that Mama called and daddy sent moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified look at all them he nothing we did we just accepted it he justified them he also glorified what shall we say then to these things repeat after me if God be for us who can be against us Happy Thanksgiving cuz that's what God give you but now look if we're not born again we're going to come to this perfect part of we're going to meet this part exactly that's perfect does everybody understand that if we don't accept the pardon if we don't accept this will if we don't attach oursel to this economy or this or this uh family of God you're going to me it's not like say well well if I don't choose to accept then I'm okay no if you don't choose to accept then you've got to meet that perfect again and God is going to ask you why right you didn't exactly and when you turn that down that brings the Judgment right that's why that we're already judged now and don't have to be judged later okay and has passed from death death and life now let's go to Ephesians 1 if we don't come to this word birth or the old adamic nature must die right then we've got to give an account for that old man right but just like I told him in in in Oklahoma my grandfather Daddy's Daddy has been dead since 19 45 there's no way I could go out tomorrow and go to and get me a lawyer and go to court and tell the whole Court my grandpa robbed a bank yesterday why he's dead right been dead right go show you where he's buried that's the same thing's got to happen to me and you right because if he was alive alive I'd have a case right if he was alive I'm telling you if he was alive I'd have a case right right but if he's dead there's no case in the court of the land going to ever accuse a dead man of doing something after he's already died same way with you and I that old adamic Nature has to die now Ephesians 1 I hope you knew that's where we were coming to now remember the mind of god is perfect amen the mind of God was back before the foundation of the world the mind of God was way up here up here all right and then we had to come down here to get into the permissive part all right but even getting into the permissive part there's a way back amen okay this is the simple part but let's watch Ephesians chapter 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are in Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus so it's not to the world it's to the saints that are in Christ Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us with [Music] him oh what did that say in not with in where were we we were in him amen before the foundation of the world Amen chosen Us in him before for the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love that cannot be talking about tonight in a natural form none of us are holy we're holy if we're in Christ right and Without Blame oh NOP sorry I saw you do it you saw me do it so this must be in heaven this must be what God has stamped that's going to be this is the mind of God this is eternal before the foundation world that we should be holy God took a picture of you before you ever got here and that's what you're going to Glory Without Blame before him in love having pred destinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will that's nothing in that's permissive his will is perfect right to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved all let's say it like this wherein he ha made us accepted in the attribute Brother G is that okay in the attribute cuz if you weren't in that attribute you're never going to get down here to this verse 7 through 14 exactly so verse 1-6 is what God has already said about us that perfect will of God that can never be changed can never go away listen people if we're holy and Without Blame Satan's blaming us already we understand that but this part of God is what he's already saw that's going to happen now look at verse seven he's dropping down to tell you how yeah that we're going to get back up to verse 3 through6 in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace right now I believe that's right here now wherein Heath abounded toward us look at all those uses and we and all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us right now that wasn't before the foundation of the world we were already in him we were there but look at this having made known unto us what reading of his will after the death of the testator shedding see look say in Redemption through his blood we know he died 2,000 years ago but we know he died before the foundation of the world but brother brand said if if he didn't die 2,000 years ago and shed his natural blood there was no 4,000 years ago that he died in the mind of God exactly so he had to come here and do it so we look to that amen that he absolutely came on this Earth and did what he said he was going to do Glory shed through his blood that's right having made known unto us the mystery of his word will when not before the foundation of the world right here right glory after you've heard the word trth of Salvation truth we'll get to that that's what he's saying right here Paul is going to bring us take us from Heaven show us it's already done and finished bring us down on Earth and tell us how we're going to get to that amen because look having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good good pleasure remember it all works back to his pleasure which he has purposed in himself I am going to have a bride amen look I am going to have this string right here that's called eternity I am going to have what was in my mind there's nothing going to stop that right the reason he can do that though he saw what we would want and we would want that right the Eternal part so he had it there for us a fish he could have never brother R said a lot of times you know he say well the sulfur the the sulfur had to be there in the rubber the had to be there before the child had a desire same thing with you and I yeah there had to be a God in heaven there had to be eternal life there had to be shed of the blood for us to want it for that desire to be drawn to that right can't be drawn you know water can't if there's no water there why do you need a fish right but since we got water now we have a fish all right that in the dispensation of the fullness of times now when is that now this is the dispensation of the fullness of all things amen right he might gather together in one what one mystery all things in Christ right both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance am what being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will amen are the for knowledge of his word that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ L now 13 13- 14 Paul's going to sum it all up he's going to put this all together in whom you ye also Trust after I told him that word after after and if are two big words yeah if may be a little word but if is a very big word right if you believe if you have eternal life tonight that eternal life always was eternal amen if but if you don't then what you weren't right in whom ye also trusted what you had Faith trusted yeah if I trust Brother Gary I got faith in it in whom also you trusted after that you heard the word of truth right look in the book of Acts no one received the Holy Ghost without a message being preached to him there was a message preached the Holy Ghost fell after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation right in whom also there's that word again after Paul said come to those those Brethren and said that you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe also after that you believe you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise right which is the earnest of our inheritance right until the Redemption of the purchased possession amen unto the praise of his glory are his perfect will right Paul takes you to heaven shows you what the mind of God said showed us how it was going to happen to the shedding of the blood that we after that we heard the word of Truth after that we believed and then we receive an Earnest now if you put money down it's been explained before but listen to this if you take your earnest money and say you've got three payments which we got a lot more than that that's 30 years most of us but you take this earnest money and you go to the bank and the bank says there's no way you can have this loan without this earnest money but now after you put this earnest money down if you meet the requirements through your term of your loan the house is yours right though the earnest money be only a maybe 5% 10% and you get a $200,000 house that's $220,000 you say man that's only you know 10% of the of the purchase of the purchase price cuz the price is $200,000 but now which is more important the payments or the earning money if that Banker says you've got to put 20% or 10% down or you Ain got to worry about these payments right you got to make this first earnest money right here think it so which one's more important right earnest money or getting the full possession right it's it's more important or just as important as any of these payments that you make and if you make that earnest money you then are given a payment book and in God's economy brother Ram said God gives you a checkbook amen how do you pay for most of your payments most of us used to be by cash but they don't do that anymore they don't know what cash is anymore check check brother Brown said God gives you a check but with his name on it when you start but said when you get up to a certain part you know when you get up to a certain part you're paying a lot of interest but when you get toward the end of that loan you're paying a bundle of principal then then God finally he says hey I trust you here's you some blank ones yeah make the full payment right make the full payment right amen what is the full payment Body Spirit and soul Eternal GL not just walking around here with with with with um you know with troubles and trials and problems no it's knowing what God wants right knowing what God is and knowing what God is doing listen to this quote right here then we'll then we'll we'll kind of wrap it up Blasphemous names 1962 now let me read this one first cuz this this one's kind of cute Brother brownman spoken words Original Seed 1962 well that's the same thing from predestination you were supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning but being that you came the way you did you're subject to the fall right but being that you're predestinated and you hear the word and it brings you right back where you were predestinated right amen never saw that before amen right never saw that before brings you right and what makes you believe the word of God and turn down these other things is because there's something in you way back y you were supposed you what you may you are made to live here forever now Blasphemous names 1962 I believe there is a bride that's predestinated I believe God said he would have a church without spot or wrinkle I believe in predestination he didn't have a problem saying it then right he didn't say that wasn't a bad word to say he said I believe in predestination right that the bride is predestinated she's got to be there I hope I'm with her see I'm with her now it's up to me to work out my own salvation with God until these things are approved of God and then sealed into theing kingdom of God there's the Holy Spirit brother Donnie there's the genuine works of God it's sealed until the day of redemption that was her dream he's talking about the sister that had a dream the church is predestinated to be there right there's a bride there's going to be a bride right gu what God everybody said well well then it seems like it's stamped no there are certain things that God said he was going to have but that he purposed in his mind I'm going to have children right I'm going to have a bride I'm going to have a future home whatever's in this book right here that that through what what happened Moses picked up the mind of God then what did he do he wrote it in a book well who was it Moses writing it no Moses wasn't in the Garden of Eden who was in the Garden of Eden the one that was helping Moses right right he was just using Moses's hand right CU Moses wasn't in the Garden of Eden right but the one that was right in he had got into the what he got into the mind of the composer come on Amen and he and the composer became one right but now remember Moses That Couldn't reside and stay on Moses that had to come away from Moses and he was just a mortal man right but what about you and I come on folks we're supposed to be that that thing comes on us and stays in us not that it just and I know there's different anointings that we have but we're supposed to be the mind of God all the time now listen there's one other thing Jesus said in Matthew 28:18 he said all power in Heaven and Earth has been given to me like we talked about the other night this is what sparked his old thing we were talking about that me and brother dick I believe that we've got to come to that place Amen to where we stand not just not just say I believe what he said right we can't just believe what he said right we got to become what he said amen and when Jesus stood and said all power in heaven and earth been given unto me where's the power of death and Hell where's the power of anything all power has been given unto me both in heaven and on Earth glory and where is that man tonight he's in the heart of the Believers hallelujah amen that is what Satan can't understand he can't understand that even all down through those Church ages there was a group of people that come to an understanding of God and it looked like that God wasn't even with those people like in the fourth age look like God had done like the author said stood back with his arms folded but all those people had to come there had to be a falling away there had to be a dying off for the for the uh the sheeps to come back up and to get the grain back out but let's one more thing let me see for my book we'll be done this little message called the word became flesh in India trip now brother Joe you don't have these this is 1954 brother brandom just got back from India October the 3rd 1954 and he's speaking about the India trip and then he preached a little message because of the word becoming flesh this is 1954 right page 26 paragraph 124 and every word in the Bible is God's thought laid in seed form that if received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible brings the thing to pass right thank you amen hard to swallow amen let me read that one more time how big does it make you not and every word word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed form that if received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible brings the thing to pass Glory that's the speaking of the word right see what I mean how powerful could the church be this is 1954 right right the Bible said let this mind that was in Christ be in you as a man thinking in think in his heart so is he now your thoughts if they become expression like God said let there be a world before it could be a word it had to be a thought right so God in the creation created the world by his thought first then he spoke it right right and the thought expressed became material see what I mean now he didn't stop there listen to this now if that same spirit that said let there be light and there was light that said let there be trees and there was trees and if that if that same mind that was in Christ be in you oh how much could it say let there be no cancer oh my and it would be gone come on GL let the blind eyes be opened yes and it would be so right so it's your thought Jesus said verily you said that was Jesus but wait a minute he said have faith in God for ver verily I say unto you if you shall say to this mountain right be moved and plucked and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you say it'll come to pass you'll have whatever things thou sayest is that right you shall have it not me you shall have it what power has been given to the church now you can express it by mental conception that's right read right or you can quote it right listen to this I'm going to read it slow but if let me read the the sentence over again now you can EXP express it by mental conception period but if it becomes a real revelation of God glory that you see it before it happened yeah and express it in word form come on that word takes a hold oh my and becomes material come on think about it a thought expressed right if your heart and your mind mind is so filled with God's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts amen there you are when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal being oh my what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts oh thank you Lord you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinions but the Holy Spirit as you so build until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of a church would we be paragraph 131 I'm not finished it's get get it's good and they that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God then when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy where you empty yourself amen then will be when the church in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving you see what I mean then your thoughts then your thoughts will become words right and words will become material amen look how many times he said that I believe it's on its road that when the church will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away from theirselves that they don't see themselves they don't have no Blank Spot on tape but to serve God and their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity amen because deity will be revealed in human beings amen but by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thoughts of their mind right let's stand he said our thoughts run different right A lot of times we walk up and say how do you do brother and you don't mean it in your heart and a lot of times we say I'm this and I'm that you don't mean that in your heart I don't mean it in my in my heart but when you can become so dead to the things of the world that Christ is first Christ is all that your entire makeup is of the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ he has full control that's when your thoughts will be clean your thoughts will be pure your heart your heart and you know what brought all this on let me tell you what brought all this on cuz you get over to the end of the book and brother Brenham is praying he said Lord page 40 and I recognized the other day a selfish Spirit coming up in me oh my of saying this man's wrong I ought to tell him about it that's wrong God is the one to tell him about it it's none of my business but my business is to preach the gospel and love everybody and move on and love my enemies as Jesus Christ loved me when I was his enemy that's right when I was unlovable he loved me to his bosom and anybody that's unlovely let me love him the same let the spirit that was in Christ be in us I love him I love him and there several times in this book that when he got back from India a saving is to the last a prophet so so reading this word that I just read to you how gripping that was to me yes and he says all that came about because I had a selfish Spirit coming upon me and I was critical about about people yeah that's why he was coming I believe he was preaching the gospel and he was actually asking God said look that was in my mind so I I want that out of my mind s Gil I want this spirit that I've been reading you where so much of God is in my mind that I don't have a problem with somebody right that I don't have somebody's wrong brother R said if they're wrong let God deal with them but he had a selfish Spirit on him is what caused him really if you'll read this whole book it's a good book word become flesh in India trip 1954 read that book that's where these Quotes come from he want want the mind of Christ that's what I wrote here cuz that's what he wanted he said God I want your mind I don't want my selfish attitude my selfish spirit that I'm so selfish that I can't love my brothers right amen all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me and where did he give that power to I thought on the day of Pentecost he give it to the people the will sin is Will [Music] this wh and now guess what I'm bullheaded I'm bullheaded to the gospel want to be more bullheaded to the gospel but I don't want to be so have a so selfish Spirit though that I'm arrogant about it's like brother dick when I was reading that on the plane I was like Lord we got a long way to go I got a long way to go if that's what I got to be but see God said he'd show you where he's at if he shows you where he's at then he's got enough Grace to get you to where this is right here where I just read that brother Bram said we must become deity in human beings Glory where not just God's thought are just Bo by his stripes you're healed uh-uh no we're not doing away with this like brother's been preaching that's the foundation Glory let us go on to Perfection right brother you never had in the first place whatever you have is gone right Lord it never had a beginning right cuz all power in heaven Earth has been given unto you right so does the devil have it does some other person have it you have the Holy Ghost then you have exactly right that's too

matter how bright it gets right you understand what I'm saying I can take that light and shine in Sister G's eyes and it would blind her but if she ever become that same light it never it would never
