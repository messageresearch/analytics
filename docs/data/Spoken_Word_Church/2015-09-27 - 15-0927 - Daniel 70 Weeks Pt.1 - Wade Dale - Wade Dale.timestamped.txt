[0:00] to have a document man knows that the
[0:02] fourth dimension is ready away it's
[0:04] everything your television signal your
[0:07] radio signal your cell phone signal the
[0:09] internet everything runs through that
[0:12] fourth dimension which is ready away hey
[0:16] listen though we have a lot of fun it's
[0:19] no different than radio that we had back
[0:21] when it's just it's capturing more of an
[0:24] image nobody understand why they brother
[0:27] Brown said this was the worst time to
[0:28] live because why do you know if I can
[0:32] take my phone out which game to cut her
[0:34] first I take this thing right here I can
[0:37] mash about four buttons and we can watch
[0:39] a pornographic movie right here so where
[0:41] is it is it way out yonder no it's
[0:43] running right there there that's why
[0:47] them demons brother robin said travel
[0:49] affords me that's why you should now
[0:50] television that television is a portal
[0:54] internet to say is a portal to that
[0:57] fourth dimension the bottle says handle
[1:00] has expanded their get its gates one if
[1:04] you go back to that thing and i'll try
[1:06] to find it and i'll bring it remember
[1:09] when HD came out high-definition you
[1:12] analog analog filled up they have filled
[1:17] that fourth dimension so full they had
[1:19] to have more technology so now is high
[1:24] definition because it used to be analog
[1:28] everything without a lot for years it
[1:30] would all hell up and it showed the
[1:32] radio waves every and you know what the
[1:35] government hasn't allotted set up ready
[1:37] away you can't get on their signal they
[1:41] have a certain radio frequency that you
[1:44] can't get them all right well the
[1:45] devil's got a certain radio breathe
[1:46] until the fourth dimension when I told
[1:48] them I said would they come out with HD
[1:50] now they had analog he's filled up now
[1:52] that go HD HD snap from huge devil
[2:02] we used to watch a little television
[2:04] about that big look at the things that
[2:06] got now you go down the road and you
[2:07] look and you see these TV screens are as
[2:11] big as this room up on the Billboard you
[2:13] know yeah well man has broke into that
[2:18] fourth dimension so much we got let me
[2:21] get through the dimension hope the
[2:22] question that fourth dimension is radio
[2:24] wave something you can't see there's
[2:25] body's going through here right now
[2:27] that's words going through the lookup
[2:28] think of all the vulgar cell phone
[2:31] conversations that's going through this
[2:33] room you say how can you pick it up just
[2:35] pick your cell phone out if you can dial
[2:36] into who balloons that they were going
[2:38] to do you can listen to it right there
[2:40] so the fourth dimension is already a way
[2:42] to something you can't see the fifth
[2:44] dimension is where the center dead go if
[2:47] you guys Center you go into the fifth
[2:50] dimension that's why I said you know you
[2:52] say well they're in Hell burning right
[2:53] now there's no such thing as that
[2:56] they're not at Hell burning right now
[2:59] they're sitting somewhere in a dimension
[3:02] their soul is in a dimension somewhere
[3:05] they're not in the grave they're in a
[3:07] dimension a place of holding which is
[3:09] the fifth dimension which is the dead
[3:11] people when they die and they haven't
[3:14] give their heart to God and they haven't
[3:15] become a Christian they go in the fifth
[3:18] dimension and that's where they are held
[3:20] until what until the white throne
[3:23] judgment they you know they don't come
[3:25] up anymore see now the sixth dimension
[3:29] okay the sixth dimension is the bride
[3:33] the sixth dimension is all Christians
[3:35] Paul is in the sixth dimension them
[3:37] Peter James John brother Brown all the
[3:39] ones that died from them too right now
[3:42] brother Gary Gary Atkins is now when
[3:46] heat when he passed away his soul just
[3:47] went right over in that sixth dimension
[3:48] and he's more perfect now than he was
[3:51] here okay that's why Christians don't
[3:55] die hopefully their body sleeps
[3:58] but then he's not sleeping he's over
[4:02] there rejoicing while we're still
[4:04] worrying about bills and
[4:06] I go to work tomorrow cares why see how
[4:10] creasing is supposed to rejoice when the
[4:13] Christian passes away he's broken this
[4:15] veil of one two and three dimension and
[4:17] he's broke over into the sixth dimension
[4:19] where it's all eternity now you say one
[4:22] more dimension number seven there's only
[4:24] one man in that dimension right now I
[4:26] said right now and that's the Lord Jesus
[4:28] Christ okay why brother round I mean the
[4:32] Bible says no man has reached a
[4:33] mortality at seven Jesus Christ now
[4:35] immortality means that you were mortal
[4:38] okay you were moral this is mortal you
[4:42] have died come back and picked up this
[4:45] mortal body and become immortal that's
[4:49] why my brother drowned I don't know if
[4:50] you know it or not but the property God
[4:52] when God let him go into that sixth
[4:54] dimension he actually didn't go into the
[4:56] fifth dimension remember and saw hell he
[5:00] went over into joy sobbing women with
[5:01] mascara and cut hair and all that stuff
[5:03] then he went over into the sixth
[5:06] dimension and saw the saints that had
[5:07] passed on right and then he said well
[5:10] where's the Lord Jesus I want to see him
[5:12] what it what did the angel telling them
[5:14] he's higher in other words he's in
[5:16] another dimension number seven so what's
[5:21] that what what's going to happen in the
[5:23] resurrection is Jesus is going to come
[5:25] Jesus Christ that has a now a immortal
[5:28] body that he lived in on earth now it's
[5:31] immoral there's no I like that six
[5:33] dimension they don't have their flesh
[5:35] over there right they're not eating
[5:37] they're not drinking anything they're
[5:38] sitting and waiting and I'll promise you
[5:42] they're not bored they're not bored okay
[5:47] but you know what though brother Brown
[5:50] said they were what waiting because
[5:53] they're not complete a man they're
[5:57] perfect now listen that's that spirit
[6:00] that we talked about before they're in a
[6:05] spirit realm sure they have a body that
[6:07] looks like a flesh body but he has no
[6:09] flesh like this the flesh they were born
[6:11] in all right Jesus is in the flesh he
[6:15] was born in
[6:16] so to get back in the flesh he was born
[6:18] in we're going to have to get
[6:20] Jesus is going to come and pick up that
[6:21] sixth dimension all the saints can bring
[6:24] a run back here to this earth connect
[6:26] with their body you're not going to see
[6:28] graves bust it open that's an old wives
[6:33] tale cuz i heard i thought it was a
[6:36] secret catching away now what if you
[6:38] walked out in the tenth big old cemetery
[6:41] and you see these graves popped open you
[6:43] know something has happened but what a
[6:48] great thing that that's sold in that six
[6:50] dimension which went to a wall we have
[6:53] clever Gary out the door the other day
[6:55] you don't mind if I you the right I
[6:56] didn't think you would but brother yeah
[6:58] you didn't have to let him out the door
[6:59] for a soul to leave no it just whipped
[7:03] over in a faster dimension just stepped
[7:06] right over and he's more real now than
[7:08] he was then we got to start realizing
[7:10] that more real now than he was then
[7:12] because this is what this is not real
[7:14] this is vanity vanity of vanities Jesus
[7:19] is going to come from the seventh
[7:20] dimension pick up all those in the sixth
[7:21] dimension they're going to step right
[7:22] back into this dimension pick up their
[7:25] bodies you can say well they got to go
[7:28] down again whatever it don't matter to
[7:32] me you're just not going to see an empty
[7:33] you're not gonna see a gray popped open
[7:35] that body is going to come out of hand
[7:37] he just didn't have a problem walking
[7:38] through all over with his glorified body
[7:40] d but what a mystery though when the
[7:43] Bible puts a little thing in there and
[7:45] Jesus said give me some fish he went
[7:49] hungry he was just trying to show the
[7:51] disciples that he was in a human body
[7:52] again he said give me some visibly eat
[7:55] it well it didn't hit the floor when he
[7:56] ate it it went somewhere because when he
[8:01] went back out that wall I don't I don't
[8:04] wanna start preaching when he went
[8:06] through that wall he took that
[8:08] winning right so there's something he
[8:11] was in a glorified condition so there's
[8:14] your glorified body coming back to this
[8:15] dimension then what are we going to do
[8:17] we're going to go what back into another
[8:19] dimension whatever one aisle six
[8:22] dimension if you want to herself does
[8:23] that mean it was for me doesn't mean
[8:25] ever because we're gonna have a marriage
[8:26] supper while all this is being blowed up
[8:28] down here right but the people it's
[8:32] going to be killed down here after the
[8:35] Millennium even the foolish spurgeon are
[8:39] going in a dimension and they're going
[8:41] to be held there for a thousand years
[8:43] because they didn't give their heart
[8:45] that God didn't Oh God didn't owned
[8:46] their soul alright so if you don't own
[8:49] something that's not the earth you can't
[8:52] come and get something that's not yours
[8:53] alright but they're going to live
[8:55] they're going to stay in that dimension
[8:57] for a thousand years and then they're
[8:59] going to have to be resurrected and give
[9:01] an account for what they did on the
[9:03] earth that's when the Bible says you'll
[9:05] be judged by your works and I don't ever
[9:07] want to be judged by my work a Christian
[9:09] is never judged by his work we're
[9:13] already just the Bible said a man we're
[9:16] already judged we don't have to be
[9:18] judged again that's why we don't that's
[9:19] why that you know most of your
[9:21] denominations and all say that we have
[9:24] to be judged we don't have to go to the
[9:26] washroom Jetta the Bible says there's
[9:29] one sitting on the throne and thousands
[9:30] upon thousands upon thousands ministered
[9:32] with them what the bride's going to be
[9:34] sitting in judgment with God so I hope
[9:37] that to help you out so you got seven
[9:39] dimensions so we're going to tame this
[9:42] dome we're going let's read this real
[9:43] quick and Jeremiah 25 and this will kind
[9:49] of set a basis but I want you to let's
[9:53] just start with verse 10 that will I
[9:55] want to read it all but let's not look
[9:57] look at verse 6 now watch Jeremiah he's
[9:59] telling the people I'm sorry let's go
[10:03] back to two we got it we got to cover
[10:05] this verse to the wish Jeremiah the
[10:08] Prophet spending to all the people of
[10:09] Judah now who are they juzt okay Jews
[10:13] and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[10:16] saying from the 13th year Joe Simon son
[10:19] of a lion king of Judah even to this day
[10:22] that is the three and twentieth year one
[10:25] third year the word of the Lord have
[10:26] come into me and I've spoken
[10:28] to you rising early and speaking but you
[10:30] have not hearken the Lord has sent until
[10:36] you all his servants the prophets rising
[10:39] early and sending them but you have not
[10:41] hearken or incline your ear to hear they
[10:45] said turn you again now everyone from
[10:47] his evil way and from the evil of you're
[10:49] doing and dwell in the land of Thor have
[10:51] given unto you to your father for ever
[10:53] and ever and going on after other gods
[10:56] to serve them and to worship them and
[10:59] provoke me not to anger with the works
[11:01] of your hands and I will do you know her
[11:03] God's telling them you do what I tell
[11:06] you to do her right therefore thus says
[11:10] the Lord of hosts because you have not
[11:12] heard my words okay you have not heard
[11:16] my words behold I will send and take all
[11:20] of the families of the North said the
[11:22] Lord and Nebuchadnezzar the king of
[11:25] Babel in my servant and will bring them
[11:28] against this land against inhabitants
[11:30] thereof it against all these nations
[11:31] round about and will utterly destroy
[11:33] them make them an astonishment and
[11:35] hissing in a perpetual desolation
[11:40] moreover I will take from them the voice
[11:42] of mirth and the voice of gladness the
[11:44] voice of the bridegroom and the voice of
[11:46] the ride so now I'm going to be bride
[11:48] anymore and they're not going here from
[11:50] Gregory the sound of the mill strong and
[11:53] the light of the candle and this whole
[11:55] land shall be a desolation an
[11:58] astonishment and these nations shall
[12:00] serve the king of babbling 70 years
[12:03] there's you promise all right and it
[12:06] shall come to pass when 70 years or
[12:08] accomplished now that this is the
[12:10] natural time when 70 years are
[12:13] accomplished that I will punish the king
[12:16] of battling we'll get into that and that
[12:19] nation said Lord for their iniquity of
[12:20] the land of the child
[12:22] we'll make it perpetual desolations
[12:25] that's the natural happening of Israel
[12:28] and I will bring up on that land all not
[12:30] work which I pronounced against it even
[12:32] all that is written in this book Kris
[12:34] Jenner might have promised I'd against
[12:37] all nations pretty serious business in
[12:41] it okay but we're going to read that a
[12:44] little bit later on now let's turn to 28
[12:47] and what happens is Jeremiah comes up
[12:59] and let me just give you a commentary
[13:01] real quick then we'll start on that next
[13:03] week but Jeremiah puts a yo cuz remember
[13:07] prophets sometimes use you how brother
[13:10] Brown took them you know you threw a
[13:12] stone up in the in the skies that does
[13:15] that the Lord you know the judgmental
[13:18] strike the west coast national in the
[13:19] 1964 alaska earthquake like the song
[13:22] alaska right sometimes profits have to
[13:25] do things you watching them in the bible
[13:27] they do they do something for a sign
[13:29] before God brings judgment well what
[13:33] what Jeremiah did and we had timely go
[13:37] back read it but what he does he puts a
[13:39] yoke around his neck and says it is
[13:42] Roble Bo with the bondage that we just
[13:45] talked about here all right just to make
[13:48] a long story short but now what happens
[13:50] is there's a man comes up in chapter 28
[13:56] named pen and I Hananiah is also a
[14:01] profit all right having out as a prophet
[14:06] now what does Hananiah did Hannah 9 in
[14:10] other words let's go to let's see
[14:20] verse says the jest of the whole thing
[14:24] is is Jeremiah they're standing together
[14:26] in a room and Jeremiah's got yoga around
[14:27] his neck had an eye comes in and says no
[14:32] no I don't think that's that the Lord
[14:34] said told me it was only going to be two
[14:36] years before we get that 168 plus to
[14:41] make 70 they will way back before the 70
[14:44] years started okay if I got that same
[14:46] app until they're standing in Jeremiah's
[14:49] prophecy on the future event he puts the
[14:51] yoke around his neck says Israel will be
[14:53] yoke for 70 years nevertheless here thou
[14:58] now this word that I speak about ears
[15:00] and in the ears of all the people the
[15:02] prophets that have been before me and
[15:03] before the up d before me Jeremiah and
[15:06] the pennine of old prophesied both
[15:09] against many countries against great
[15:11] Kingdom the war of evil and pestilence
[15:13] the profits with prophesize of peace
[15:15] when the word the prophet shall come to
[15:17] pass then show the Prophet be known that
[15:19] the Lord has truly set him that's the
[15:25] challenge it might be spoken in soft
[15:27] words but that's a challenge Jeremiah
[15:30] saying you and me one of us is right and
[15:33] the other one is wrong and God's one
[15:37] this gold shall left and then shall the
[15:40] Prophet be known what to the people that
[15:42] the Lord have truly sent him to what
[15:45] happens you got to profits down here a
[15:47] true intent of false hope all right this
[15:50] is where the preacher have got mad out
[15:52] you got mad at me for bringing this out
[15:53] I said well if you don't get down in 70
[15:55] weeks right the Bible says you gonna die
[15:56] okay because Hannah and I did he got two
[16:04] ends in two weeks wrong Daniel staying
[16:06] 70 years captivity we're going to be in
[16:08] battling for 70 years with a yoke he's
[16:11] yoked itself then handing out of the
[16:14] Prophet took do from off the Prophet
[16:16] Jeremiah neck and drove the thing down
[16:17] broke it and say let's live watch this
[16:21] now and had a nice baking the presence
[16:24] of all the people saying thus saith the
[16:26] war
[16:29] hmm even so will I break the yoke of
[16:32] Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the
[16:34] neck of all nations within space of two
[16:36] four-year not 72 and I didn't have a
[16:42] revelation he got caught up in his own
[16:45] self and it probably Jeremiah went his
[16:48] way now Jeremiah didn't jump up them
[16:49] scream stomp like a baby Jeremih just
[16:53] went on then the word Lord came unto
[16:55] Jeremiah the Prophet after they had a
[16:57] night of the Prophet had broken the yoke
[16:59] from off the name of the Prophet
[17:00] Jeremiah saying i'm going to tell hannah
[17:02] and i said thus says the Lord balance
[17:03] broken the yoke of wood but thou shalt
[17:05] make for them yokes of iron in other
[17:07] words him breaking the yoke did one
[17:12] thing for sure it made it rougher on
[17:13] Israel than it would have before right
[17:18] but that's that the Lord of hosts the
[17:20] God of Israel I have put a yoke of iron
[17:22] upon the neck of all these nations that
[17:24] they may serve in the upcoming every
[17:25] Kingdom battling they shall serve him
[17:27] and I have given him the beasts of the
[17:29] field also then said the Prophet
[17:31] Jeremiah had another prophet here now
[17:33] heading out of the Lord have not sent
[17:35] dick he's pissing get pretty Stern here
[17:40] but they'll make us this people to trust
[17:43] in a lot therefore thus saith the Lord
[17:48] behold I will cast thee from off the
[17:49] face of the earth down it's not saying
[17:52] that he stand to hell he's just not
[17:53] gonna live talking the way he's talking
[17:56] therefore this theft or build on Cassidy
[17:59] from off the face of the earth this year
[18:01] thou shalt done because thou has taught
[18:04] rebellion against the Lord so how now
[18:06] the Prophet died the same here in the
[18:09] seventh month okay that's right now
[18:12] we're reading just a little bit in 29
[18:15] verse 8 the bottle says with us that the
[18:18] Lord of hosts the God of Israel let not
[18:19] your profits and your diviners that be
[18:21] in the midst of you deceive you neither
[18:24] hearken to your dreams would you cause
[18:25] to be dream but they promised I'm
[18:27] falsely unto you in my name I have not
[18:29] sent them stay aboard
[18:31] sent the order this Jeremiah dust at the
[18:33] horn that after 70 years be accomplished
[18:35] at Babylon I will visit you that's what
[18:38] God is telling them and perform the good
[18:40] word towards you and causing you to
[18:43] return to this place and I underlined
[18:45] this real thing because where were they
[18:47] they were intruding so they're gonna
[18:48] bring run back to the roof right let's
[18:50] go read that chapter 28 and 29 again I
[18:54] rush through it but we'll study on
[18:57] global
