good morning everybody good morning that's all right yeah I always say if your name crazy bus system the Sunday School Board say something to be a help to your children father was for the 40 and on his left speaking Irish to hear your genders tending of your word prayer bus all the other ones and then there's some high school class restored open there [Music] and also before we get started next honey oh we will have this down here we will have our gift-giving thing down here for Sunday School and then we're going to go upstairs for the next set the entire Christmas Christmas dinner only we'll have one service you have cut stuff fine once our mission and we'll have some regular will not have done good look at now gift giving in thank you and then we'll look there if anybody had to give in the box ladies taking care of it so you can give it to it okay all right going good today we're going to talk about think on these things I want to talk a lot about meditation for the way it's been on the book of Philippians so I think this will fit in nice because I'm gonna focus on one scripture and that's Philippians 4:8 there's a scripture about meditation and I think it's a key that we overlook a lot as Christian meditation is a very powerful tool and I've never thought it was just for the ministers I know the ministers meditate a lot on their sermons but I think it's for late even for the sister everybody ought to think about things you've heard preached the the sermons you Mista to go around them the scripture you read and even things that happen in your life we'll get into natural and spiritual journey of things that you should meditate on okay but it's been a very powerful tool in my life thing that's helped me a lot recently we've heard preached brother Aaron he preached a little bit a while back I don't remember the title of the sermon but in his sermon he was preaching about talking about just natural testimonies in his life saying so he's still not rehearsing right rehearsing the things we're saying the things we've heard because you can so easily put things sweep things under the rug kind of forget things that the lowest done they talked about his grandfather I think was in World War two and a company of something like 50 to I think only two of them survived or something like that you said he testified about that there was this force field or something that was the victim they were being fired at by the enemy and they could hear these bullets ricocheting off of something that they couldn't even see so the Lord was protecting him to get brother Aaron brother Richard here and so forth Stevie I was away and all those things and those things we should never forget never overlooked because even in our natural journey of life God is working got it moving and all of that so to meditate on that yeah he also talked about his mom it was sick really bad now recently his dad brother Bill Roberts it was sick and he's all looking a lot better now over here and God was with us and so many things we overlooked you mean even brother Bob preached about I think this was two or three sermons ago for tried testing the proven and in that he mentioned the testimony I don't know each other I may get mixed up but he he lost his job I think he got laid off when Zach and Esther perform Maria after Esther born so they have two small children I'm guessing one handgun right and lost his job all right now he's going to the doctor I had place to be when you don't have a lot of money you know and then on a windy day and his paycheck blows out of the car and it's gone he says lord I need that that's my last check what that sound like to me I'm thinking first King 17 the widow woman right and she's down to her last handful of mill and looking a little bitter all done crews and well I just said make me a cake first and she said well I've got enough to make one for me my son we're gonna eat it and die but the Bob's down this last little resource last paycheck and it blows away I said lord I need that and on this windy day something I think put its finger on that paycheck and held him down said three stops glass champion and he's alright today okay but that was a trial and that's just a simple thing that he went through edifying help him yeah but God was doing that and if you don't see God in the trials even the wind blowing with you and I think a part of that and waves are a type of tribulations trials things we go through that's not always when when you're going through a trial but a lot of times there will be right the point is those things type something going on spiritually it was a great thing he should I know he won't forget that but that impresses on my mind these little things that I hear of your natural journey of trials you go through yeah and we've been through hell yeah man and also we think of mark for whether the Jesus was asleep on the back of the ship and the winds and waves were being accosted him around and yet they went to wake from semester with parish you know there's always those type of things to try to test us well the words say the Rotter says we were trying to have been take on the work you can expect a trial the comments all right yes but they'll at the end of every sermon he reminds us he almost every sermon he says at the end of it think on these things but things he's just been preaching about which is always open pretending to Redemption always something pertaining to our journey something to do with the things that Paul mentions in that verse that we'll get to hearing many many years and then the weeks that's the question he's always asking us to reflect on herself but it always seemed like every sermons about something about self-reflection meditation that were part of meditation you think on your way think about the journey of comfort because he was talking about thinking on what kind of fruit are you Barry I'm thinking on what kind of fruits you're bearing you know and so all these things we've heard recently are pertains to that all right and I would say this too don't overlook any one part of your journey has been insignificant or like God's not in it because he's in the least little details naturally and spiritually there's a lot of things God does to lead us that we overlook and think it's just haphazard or arbitrary just something just happens at random well it's not you're not a god you're being led of God you know that now we've known this to the I started saying well about ministers getting all their sermons through meditation by the way we often hear you make the comment I was talking to the Lord the other day that's meditation on lawnmower and the male car wherever for me it's in the chicken truck brother Dale was that General Motors doing a job it took three people to fill in forms he'd be sitting there writing notes for the sales you know things like that whatever you do you can find somewhere to fit this meditation into your daily devotional whether it be a long commute to work or whether it be doing dishes laundry tours around the house there's always room to put that in there somewhere just think about God while you're doing these mindless jobs we do sometimes they don't require a lot of mental activity so man Dennis exactly just to see the importance of meditation in order to see Jesus Christ working in your own life these are just a few of the things two things that I think of to meditate on there are many other things anything pertaining to the work and it is relevant anything pertaining to your journey I put I named a natural journeying spiritual journey anything pertaining to you know just life in general just a lot of things that we can meditate on see God in heaven and so on your natural journey trials and flip seems even infirmities these things aren't random you know the first example those book in the Bible we know is Joe and even in that early example the devil had to go get permission from God you can tell them you know take that hedge down so I can get a hold of Joe because God did a hedge around all of us and God you know can't touch us with in harmony or with anything until God so to motors that part out is going okay but don't touch his life so God is in control of all of it is your reasons and then how God brought you to where you are in natural life relationships the churches etc how did you get to this church how did you get to where you are spiritually and work all right now these natural trials of life you know our prime minister later about mine and Gaby's trial with I was the worst trial yet that I guess I've ever faced of our children almost dying it gives you confidence to know that God is with you one thing about him you come out the other side of that you think my lord you were there the whole time and next time you go there draw your life number two your spiritual journey how God has led you from the first time you heard the truth and it's absolute simplest form for me around 2011 when I was starting in the earliest earlier times of this meditation I learned he driving a truck thinking a lot about my journey and I started wondering about this aspect of my life this daily Bible reading a prayer where did I get that from because since I was fifteen I was reading the bow and praying every day in the Baptist Church and I still do that now in the message well it became a great blessing to me and I started wondering where if I picked that up there and looked down to the scope of my life and I remembered at four years old my grandma taught me to read the bow and pray okay well you can't say that that's not God working through a simple grandma to simply teach a little angry novella pray then 10 or 11 years later I've come back to that when I was older well who taught her to read about and pray her mom and so when I realized that best her mom is my great-grandma's EULA and Gabby's Kentucky granny so we named our third child EULA that was the time that that realization struck me in our and my journey was that even the simplest little thing of this simple little truth that I could have overlooked and thought it was random that just my grandma taught me to read the bone frame no that's a big thing there's God yeah how he continues to move you to progress forward even now to the fivefold ministry so forth now the scripture I'm gonna talk about slipping for it I'm going to name a few things about it maybe I won't agree with I might be wrong about it correct me if I'm wrong I don't know but few things I got to lay down as a background these are three verses just four examples three verses that have nothing in common they list items there are a list of things as a at a higher level I get sort of it up just briefly looking at it you might think that those are just several things to sort of stress the point maybe like they're not really necessary like it's several words just to say the same thing but it's not I believe every word of God is for purpose it's all in there for a reason and even the order the number of the words is significant so like for example every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of lights which there was no variableness neither shadow of turning if you look up good and perfect it's not just saying the same thing good means usable and agreeable right God starts something good alright now he's gonna bring it to perfection it's what God does everything that starts it and then he finishes they say the perfect is maturing fullness completion then in Genesis he said when he created to bow says that the Lord looked and saw that everything was good I didn't say perfect if there's nothing wrong with it no flaws but it still had to go through a process there had to be a fall and redemption of man forgot be manifested in the garden and then back in and we get to the future home and to be perfect but everything God does is good at the start of it your new birth the start of your journey is good but you continue on to perfection so that's not random it's not haphazard those both those words are there for reasons and the scripture about Galatians about the through the spirit Galatians 5:4 the Spirit is love joy peace mystery long-suffering gentleness goodness finish three faith maintenance meekness temperance there's three against such there is no law and they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts there are three groups of three I don't know if the number nine is significant but I know three groups of three there are three that Scofield says these are more like your when they say pertaining to your basically your reflection toward an inward part your character as an inward state is loved or peace then he says the other part the second part long-suffering gentleness goodness is your character's expression for other people and then these are faith maintenance temperature characteristic expression for God but they're all there for reason and I don't know about as far as the order of them but I know these are in order this is good first and then perfect now we know second T no one is definitely there are eight clinics listed the number of those is significant eight for the bobster mentioned Winston I vote eight I think is a symbol of eternity continuation because they're seven days a week to go back they face back to the first day again without a starting point inflation eternity so what this is bringing to is something you've time in and the number of the missing in the order of Mister is significant because they all correspond to the churches so even though we Rome is significant these are not have mattered random things that's correct so with that in mind Philippians 4:8 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely but certain things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things and then the next first I say this this is what I'm saying I said this is talking about the new birth your journey from start to finish I'll break it down here in just a minute but just to underline that emphasize that the next verse Paul is saying those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me a man that's born again those things do and the God of peace shall be with you if you follow me as I follow Christ okay so now all I did here put a number to each one that they're still in the order that they're on that verse my finally brethren what sort of things are there faith things that all go a is and represents eternity in mathematics it's it's the symbol of infinity a number that has no end and the literal number eight there's no starting point and ending point if you draw a nice name eight you can't tell where it starts and where it ends there are eight things the first one is truth well what's the first thing you have to come to in your journey I might really come to God you have to answer it well the four-year-old boy and the grandma say I've read about Craig she showed me that she actually got down with us as a 55 year old woman there about for Chris to me was really old and got down on her knees and pray and then the next thing if you are really sincere in that and you receive the truth and really believe it it will come you lead you to honesty so you're honest with God honest with yourself you begin to see because of that truth that you received when you first heard the message or when you first think I heard Jesus Christ died for your sins I'm before you came to justification you heard that Jesus died for your sin and your Center need salvation when that first really begins to strike in your heart it cause you to be honest dawn honest with yourself you begin to realize you're a sinner and you need salvation that goes beyond just pray on the sinner's prayer because in the Baptist Church many of my friends they were taught this eternal security you know they don't say he comes Karianna banister but what we're taught is all you have to do is pray this prayer no matter what to do the rest of your life you can't help me you just played the plug whatever you do you'll go to heaven when you die like some kind of mysterious potion you just pray that prayer you're good to rest your life I know a lot of people that believe that and then don't serve God but then looking back to prayer that phrase fifty years ago that they gave when there was a kid today so but if and then in the message there are people who believe that you come with a seed in you and I have to do is come a message if you came to the message you must be born again you must be right you must have that scene in you must be okay and a lot of churches that believe that you see people that read the Bible and pray that or see God they may come to church you know maybe not but that's not honesty when it come from real honesty you will come to justify but I did you will come to sanctification which is also where a lot of people stopped before I'm talking about number four here purity sanctification you will come to the number five which is the lovely the baptismal to spare the love of God shed abroad in your heart okay and that makes your life of good report before God because he's pleased with you if he is pleased with you in those other stages immunity he's accepted your sacrifice he will come and give you the Holy Ghost here accepting your sacrifice good life because it gave rapport you say that's my boy that's my girl and then you come to these virtues what you don't know is the stuff your perfect man I sent for many comic books to gain those godly virtues that's and then the capstone which is praise I think on these things it says if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things so Paul is telling us to go through your whole journey think about where you've been spiritually unnaturally but especially on the spiritual side think about how God has led you and do this over and each time you come into more truths you come into being more honest you say you know Lord I really I'm still not where I need to be I want to hear more truth from both money today I want to hear something that maybe I didn't agree with that I'm wrong did I need correction in my mind and what I'm gonna leave in yeah and then that's when leaving to be honest again they're honest to come into justification a higher state of justification was a nation back from the Holy Ghost correct if anyone came to these virtues this is an unending journey as well your breathing you keep going through this that's right it never stops and then this is just to show you about the eight brother Brennan says next position seven Church age seven is completion eight is the first day again Jesus resurrection was the first fail with giving us eternal life in eternal Sabbath Sabbath high stature perfect man I'll just keep on that progressing seven a body has stopped preparing God dwells in the stature of a man reflecting himself into that in perfect worship that's what I was saying on that number that last one really stuff praise what more praise could there be godly worship in spirit and in truth there came any greater praise than pretty nominee well a many member body called a bride of Christ perfect worship God must being his tablet on manifest [Music] all right all right so these are just a few examples mostly in the Old Testament the word observed means to keep to guard observe give heed to watch for wait for it to watch and observe and so forth I'm just basically pertaining don't just let it go in one ear and out the other kind of chew on it that's move all the word God observe the sayings this is the y'all know the example in Genesis 37 Jacob and then you know the Joseph in his brother's dos was telling the dream and Jacob says shall I and my mother and my brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee and to the earth and his brethren him be him but his father observed the same Luke - this is about Mary shepherds so much mother let us even now go to Bethlehem and see this thing was just going to pass which the LORD hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and babe lying in a manger when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child they have heard him under those things were told them by the shepherds but Mary kept these things and pondered them in her heart I'm Mary doing that a lot again where he's disputing the word with the straw the Pharisees how is it that you saw me wish you not that I must be my father's business and skip on that and said his mother kept these things in her heart right Mary's belief but a bantam said I think the reason we don't see no more of it than we do we've got our minds on too many other things I think the Angels would still appear to us if we only kept their minds upon them but we're thinking about something else that's true behold there was a man in Jerusalem others asleep - whose name was Simeon and he the same man was Justin devout waiting for the consolation of Israel Holy Ghost opponent okay he'll dammit should not see death we're seeing Lord's Christ somebody who had his mind on the Lord he was staying continually before the Lord same thing with Anna the prophetess daughter fangled of of the tribal base where she was of a great age at panel skip on now but she departed not from the temple but served God with fastings and prayers night and day look 11 are saying to you asking to show be given you seek and you shall find nothing shall be opening you for every one that asketh receiveth it seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened to state continually before the Lord meditation prayer fasting favor and so forth the greatest battle ever fought this is gonna be a long quote about three the greatest battle for when God came and man did a man in his hand sorry when God can get a man in his hand until they can get senses conscience everything cleaned out until it stands with God behind it and the spirit there's not a devil in the world can poke it down in there that's right he come around say you don't feel any better your conscience has even gone to that the flu is so clear it shall hallelujah that outlet blows a whistle glory to God it shines out certainly this is clean and clear for the word of God looks from the power of God that's the main thing yes there's your battle ground your battle ground is here at the beginning back soul back in your mind that opens the mind is the gate to the soul the gates of the Spirit rather your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or the spirit or rejection spirit you can have little consciousness and little feelings and those sensations all these things that has nothing to do with it that's just little sensational thing but when it comes to the reality your mind opens it up your mind either accept it or reject it that's it Frank God but none of them miss it see it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listens to your countries listen to your memory your affection but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his work come in and blows the rest of the stuff out and every doubt is going every fear is gone every sensation that thought has gone every there's nothing standing there but the Word of God and say you cannot go against down song my team let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable my sight O Lord my strength my Redeemer so I'm 100 for a meditation of him she'll be sweet I will be glad in the Lord some 119 verse 97 oh how we love them how I love that law it is my meditation all today and verse 99 I have more understanding than all my teachers for by testimonies all my meditation here you can brother banner says and also that you might tell the people will be instructed to know how to tell them to receive their healing and how to wait and walk to the Lord as you meditate upon that it takes meditation on the Lord arranging into your presence that's right always while we think on these things Christ appears blind Bartimaeus us think about God bus if there be any praise the pre-emerge you think on these things our mind strolls off the first thing you know we've strayed out there somewhere we're thinking about something else let's keep Jesus on my heart on my mind all the day day and night that's the way that's not all folks that trial without several years ago 2014 we didn't realize while that was going on all the things God was doing there and during the time that I was preparing after she had already started coming back and started reviving sort of getting better I was preparing to give a testimony it started out so simple I was just going to say thank the Lord for healing our baby she nearly died but she's better thank you for a couple minutes testimony and as I kept practicing and practicing and thinking on it I begin to see more and more I'm done with work and that's where I testified if you hear the tape about the three messengers or witnesses Friday a scripture came to my mind thought that was totally random just me they arrest for me Saturday by the late spoke to me at the bow of study and said don't fear don't worry and then Sunday morning two o'clock in the morning I didn't go looking for that verse that was in my daily program my daily it was on the menu that baby for me to read first John for if it has torment and I stopped looked over gabbing applying to her and I explained to her the three witnesses now that I was realizing and from that time on I began to see God in the whole trial I'm sure the fans you what tell me that she was gonna get better he's tell me I'm fair that's all he was saying yeah that's right but because I was meditating on that later on I saw everything so when you have trials and everything you often a lot think on these things
