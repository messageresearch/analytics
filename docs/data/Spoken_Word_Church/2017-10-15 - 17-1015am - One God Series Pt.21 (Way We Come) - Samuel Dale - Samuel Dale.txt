TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so then they had her on all of that and trying to get it cleared up and for headaches and migraines and everything just remember we'll go get her the Lord willing between the services and she'll be with us this afternoon we just remember her of doing that and pray that the Lord would would deliver her from all of those things about it because anybody's ever had migraine you don't want anything to make one come I mean you do everything you can to try to to get away from them you don't want anything to happen to cause one of them to come on and they need medication you take you don't want to do it that way but just remember that and just pray that the Lord be with it remember the let's see what are we gonna not just coming Saturday but a week from Saturday the 28th will be the fall festival and just remember that and prayed the Lord we're blessed the fellowship meeting will be in November down at brother Tony's so remember that and prayed the Lord would please okay father we thank you for all the things that you've given unto us and all of life and peace and joy and thank you Lord most of all for opening your word on to us because only through that can we comprehend anything about you because if you had not have come that away to reveal yourself where would we be and father we have enough trouble as it is when life - to try to exist in things but yet the devil would fight everything he could to cut off that word being brought unto us that we could be able to fellowship in you and we pray that you just bless our wife Lord take away that sickness from her and let your loving grace be with her they were the ones traveling back home and all in the the dillion's just have your loving grace we love you and we thank you in Jesus name everybody knows where we've been reading from we reading from John and then we'll go to songs John won this in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and light shyness and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not let's go over to Psalms 51 because we're gonna try to get into the way that you and I come into being you know and we'll go to the scripture hopefully reaching it today Psalms 51 says have mercy upon me O God according to thy loving-kindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee thee only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that I mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judges behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me now you go over like Psalm 58 and you said born in sin you put them all together so you got the thing the Prophet would say you're born in sin shaping an iniquity spouse and mother's wound and go forth a liar you know as you go through you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word we have an announcement I forgot to give to Terrence but it's for the meeting at the Murphysboro Tennessee on November the 3rd 4th and 5th and their announcements is up here the guest speakers be runs brother on Spencer brother Tim Dodd and brother Murphy so you don't pick up this get a copy of it or whatever and just get an opportunity to go and be with them oh man now what are we're trying to do we've got down to a position in our own our understanding of how that things come into being and and what has happened we spent a quite a lot time speaking of these things but yet what what my point has all been is for us to see that how that God condescended down to her he would reveal himself to man all right that's been our goal now I have to see how God you know unfolded himself and thank God for a truth of the message that we could follow it like that because where would we be if we didn't have those things you know of understanding if we didn't have the prophets message to be able to say those things because you know he would like I said he'd come up and he'd say in the beginning before the eternal well how can you comprehend that there's no way of doing it so we have to believe that a prophet had a way of going back into the mind of God and seeing God unveil himself downward to you and I that we would be able to see him and to understand because that's been the whole goal of mankind should be anyway of all mankind is to see how God unveils himself and manifest himself and then dropping down and we took the three thought point of what we've been at is to see how Jesus Christ came into being came down being Almighty God and the thing and then we picked up a little bit on studying of how Adam came into being and we'll try to finish that up if we can this morning and going into the point of seeing how you and I come into being all right because to me it's very vital to understand and I just say this with all love and respect to anyone but why wouldn't anybody starts of Christianity I don't care who it is the whole world of Christianity why would it not be the joy and the greatest opportunity that mankind could ever have is to be able to listen to a prophets message as he would bring to you and I the simplicity of how God does things and reveals himself you know I mean you remember when you first heard him in he he was expressing you know he said I'm a he's trying to explain one God you know he said I'm a father I'm a son I'm a human you know I've got to all of these titles to me but I'm just one well now where would a theologian ever been able to drop down that low enough to be able to talk that you and me could understand now they may understand each other in the realm of their great words you know of doing but to work that it would come down that the Bible says that the common people heard him gladly well I I swear I think God said he's allowed us common people you know just us old people that have a very little education and thoughts but yet would be able to understand God revealing himself and what would be his purpose and what would happen and how it would take place I mean maybe that don't thrill your heart to think about how that God would do that to make himself known you know people would spend millions of dollars if they had it trying to find out of their lineage you know and they'd say well well I I know those if I was adopted and I want to find my real lineage and you know how I've always been about that that's fine to do but you know how I've always been if I what in the deal they don't make no difference I was raised as woman so just leave me alone I'm happy as me and it would do me no good find out I was a Jones or a McGillicuddy that wouldn't change one thing in my life and I've always told you if you'd offer me me ian's of dollars to change I couldn't do it well because I'm just me you say you wouldn't change your name for millions of dollars nor would you say you're stupid I agree with you who are you you know I'm just a point that my point is if we can't hold on to our lives that who raised us you know you would be adopted into a family or something and somebody raised you and take care of you and supply you everything why would you not love that person more than you would your natural mom and daddy that throws you away that got rid of either puts you in a foster home and put you in a know it's our mentality of the human mind I want to know who I am never been satisfied being the Dales well okay you understand where I stand I stand in one thing I believe God has revealed to you and I his whole plan purpose being what he is and what he's trying to make manifest and show to you and I about himself and how that we are the children of God what could be a greater thing than to know about our family tree I hope you follow what I mean because I broke it in two parts I don't care about adopting into the find I'm trying to find a family tree I'm talking about when I'm born into I was born into the Dale family and I just want to stay that away all right now but what was our point we know that Jesus Christ is Almighty God all right we're not talking about a second person or a third person or anything like that he is the very person of Almighty God of looking at well ago he's the very heart and soul of Almighty God was Jesus Christ and what did he come to do what did that man outside man flesh man come to do reveal the man that was inside of him because the man is inside of him was Almighty God what a wonderful thought that we could have about those things all right now what did the prophets say about this great eternal God he said we can watch him unfold himself down to reveal himself to mankind and like I said the other day I was listening to it again and say you know you say well he ordered done it this way he ordered done it that way he don't need us to try to help him out you know well he could have had now see you're trying to make yourself something instead of trying to see what he is he done it his way and he ain't gonna change I don't care what we think about it what we can do we are the ones that stays in trouble because of what we try to do all right but now think about it God watching God condescend then we'll watch Adam come into being and then we'll watch ourselves come into being I want that three-part thought to stay in your mind because we can watch how that that God condescended down coming from the great eternal whatever you want to call him in the beginning before the eternal the the great words that you try to make of logos theophanies whatever you know is - seeing that God would be revealing himself to the very man that he created right now then we can see that how he condescended downward and became the word that was what we were on last Sunday you know see he is the word he's always been the word it was never a time that it wasn't word so I hope you'd understand what I'm saying I've tried to illustrate it I was a child I've become a father I've become a grandfather etc trying to show the way that God has I mean that we have condescended into our being but still stay the same person well no matter how many forms you see that God would reveal himself it's still the same one true and living God it's not many God's me it's one true and living God revealing himself so as he condescended downward what else could you say when Wren said out of the bosom of the father the son came into being well there's the son and I was a father we got a son I got a father I'm a son and I'm a father then the problem will me being one right well you know if that can be with the human race your lyrics in God alright see it was the great eternal condescending and the point I've always Illustrated make sure when you try to understand the condescending of God because I've watched this of mankind in the message and how the ministers try to explain it and when they'll take that all God was he put it in the cry all is all that's all at all then it all cry supportive loser and you wind up having nothing with you and that's the devil's understanding of God that's not our understanding all that God why would the Prophet use the word all because all that God was going to reveal to mankind condescended the word for him well why not didn't believe when the Prophet said that they would be a message of cheer down through the endless ages after we leave out of here what do you mean that means that there'll be an unveiling of God when we get dire that won't be these carnal thoughts in our mind to hinder us right within all God was cutting this take it up in a great big lump and pull him over drop him down and do away over here don't do away with God just do what he's saying he's still the father Jesus prayed to it you have any trouble friend to your father I thought we believed the Bible where Jesus said it one day he said you know there is a resurrection he said I go to my father and your father I go to my garden your car well see then God unveils himself but it doesn't move everything over to here and leave an empty space because if you do then you move everything from over to Christ and leaving it then when you move from Christ to the church you've done done away with God and the Christ I love heard you say that so many times and yep and you ever said around here you'll hear me say it a whole lot more because that thing is in the mind of mankind that it's hard to even speak about it because of the rebound that you get back of trying to move we just can't understand God why not you know why you can't understand God cause you don't want to because he's done all of the things and he's done down true to reveal himself to you and I that we could see him in the most simple terms that could ever be found out all right do you see what are you doing see then he came condescended down work is only way I can say it I don't know the education or whatever where the rest said he moved over in another form he had more feet he changed his form but he didn't change his person he's still the same person but he moved over to reveal in another form I didn't change persons coming from a child to a father to a grandfather to a great one that didn't change me it just changed the way that mankind was looking at me and the things that could be made manifest by that self saying one person well why can't we follow Garnett away then there wouldn't be any problem so then the profit why'd he say Jesus Christ God Himself come into human flesh when he started condescending he moved from this say father or whatever you wanna call it over into another form call the word there's John 1:1 there's first John right you ever read that one with John you ever read first John 1:1 the martyr to read that some time because just explaining the same God all right see he moved over into our manifest himself in the form of the word to create alright so he created mankind he created all the world etc different times right all right now see then the Prophet said what did he do he said he brought that full word body now that's what we're trying to get to the point that we'll get to eventually we're brother Brown said you bypassed your theophany that's exactly right to come to flesh to be tempted that's exactly right well see Jesus never baptized well see we take my pipes like 285 going around Atlanta my pints doesn't mean that it simply means you never came that away is that an easy terminology of understanding he came word to flesh we didn't come word to flesh we come from the thoughts and things of Almighty God about mankind than any human flesh and a loss condition as we'll get to but that's what to get to see see he didn't have to come down los to do he came down to die for the loss all right he changed his form from one form to another to be able to come and manifest himself and what a wonderful thing to to do a prophet was explaining who Melchizedek was you know and even the theologians and the people you think that was God he said that was Almighty God he said because Jesus Christ he said the word come into melchester and he said then Melchizedek what about a way of a man expressing it he said Melchizedek was not seen anymore who is this Mel Chadwick now he said because he becomes Jesus Christ within that enough to see then Jesus Christ was Almighty God in human flesh that's why he could create right you know no problem with it he could create but now listen all right to try to get to the point we covered all of that about the Lord Jesus and descending and coming down and trying to understand that and follow into being and see who he was and how that he could he created you and me brought us into being of the children of God he created us naturally as flesh back in the beginning the same God is the Lord Jesus Christ right because even what is it if is Ephesians 3 and 9 where he created all things by Jesus Christ season is not a Father Son and Holy Ghost to try to divide it up into persons there's a Father Son and Holy Ghost who try to understand the one person right exactly all right now then in understanding that he was the word he was a word body and what is it theophany then a word body the Prophet huh a word body and he called it the logos or speech because the word thought I've got them laying there on the desk you can look at the word thought is is expended as being a word that can be used as thought or speech in other words you think something you speak it see God thought it and he spoke it and it come into being okay all right see then let's get down there and think about Adam because knowing God coming that way we know there's no problems with that right but how did Adam come into being all right seeing and do we think about Adam in his part that he comes into being as a human being oh well God just created him what did he create you the same way and remember my whole story last Sunday was what Adam was God's example child son child offspring whatever Adam came a special way that's you and I didn't come Adam came down a line a special way to us and we were talking about it and what did the Prophet say Adam now keeping it in mind and he was his example child what are you and I to be he gave an Adam what he wanted all of his children to be can you follow that and think about in Adam were shown the example you're not the weight of Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ was that Almighty God that never had a fallen condition never any problems with that he came down that line to come into manifestation no fallen condition right uh-huh what's he Adam he said you come like Adam like me who is this milk Saturday and then we'll repeat this in a minute so they don't have to pull up into one a did you become like Adam like me you became from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted now Adam see that's our arguments with it we try to finalize everything by our own arguments that won't work but remember Adam was created perfect right no sinful condition now because God can't create something sinful where would he get the products to bring it forward all right so now Adam came first in Genesis 1:26 and 27 cuz that's what your Bible said said let us make man and her on the image and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the ever let the man that he would create the Adam how did he create Adam first a spirit being like himself and he was put over the garden to rule the garden but there wasn't no man to till the soil see Genesis 1:26 10 and 127 in there it was that man staying in that position he could have not fallen there was no way Adam could have fallen from the 126 man will get to it in him anywhere he breathed into his nostrils and he become a living soul yeah but remember that was the way God wanted him to come cuz that was the way he wanted you and I to come so how did Adam come what did the prophets say about it they said brother Branham said what's the difference between the Genesis 1:26 man and to seven lamb he said to 1:26 man was in the image of God said then he was put into flesh into seven and become a living soul right then as being put down that's when the Lord breathed into the nostrils of Adam and he became a living soul what in other words they said brother Branham what how he said he put plain language this saying it he took Genesis 1:26 and 27 man the spirit man and he put him in flesh that's simple language in it he just put him in flash now what did he do as he was putting him in flesh what was he doing he breathed into him right forgive me for coughing I'll get it I have to slow down then so I guess maybe in this old age then life comes to where you have to slow down and get all right just forgive me for coughing but now what so the example children of God the example Adam the example child with what not any sin involved not any perversion involved not anything wrong in Genesis creating perfect the 126 man was eternal life we'll read that in just a minute and you'll see as much as I've read over and over and over to you and talk about theophany or to be able to at least understand some of it if not then you better wake up and go back and listen to some tapes or do something because I've tried my best to express to you see that 126 and 127 man he could not follow that was God's own life that was God how could God follow that was the spirit man the Prophet see that was the theophany man he said so Adam was created in the image of God which would have been word image because God was the word so he's in the image of God all right Zach likeness the Bible would say in other words why not just say it in plain language that is the life of God the Genesis 1:26 and 27 man is the life of God now what else are you gonna call it go through the message we went over and over and over the Prophet were that he talks about Adam coming into being and how the Eve was in still in theophany he said and Adam was already in theophany ruling the animals de nieve had to be brought down from that position the place with Adam to where he would have been in the right order alright now don't do no wrong by putting even - Adam now that will be the product that will cause us to fall yes but that's not the eternal part you probably agreed with as our second ago when I said it so now let's see if you agree with is that 1:26 man was eternal God that was God imparting his own life right within if he was in that then she had to be an impartation of God's life when that don't make her wrong we're gonna get to it in a minute when Brett around gets down to say that comes to free moral agency is where the problem came he was created the way God wanted mankind to be was Adam and Eve was in the same creation code I didn't say it run around and said she was in Adam in physical creation you know the real he said she was in Adam and the theophany so then you gotta have her as a very part of that of God so don't have hurt with the ability to fall at that situation Adam and Eve as when to that position of Genesis 1:20 said there's no way that could fall because that was the very life of God they got to be put into flash or you can speak of the fall and by being put into flash what happened see that's what you can't read these things in in the grievers Almanac and you can't read them in the theological terminologies of mankind about Christianity we got a letter today my brother boy he was letting us a bit about believing in brother Branham of being you know the message of the hour coming in all he was attacked in the serpent seed and he was doing all kind of thing and all at once right in the middle of it he just blowed his own story out to wind the different because he said but there is one thing you know and he him right and I could just see him but there is you know see you can't do it I don't care what you do or who the theologian goat are this message down because this is too simple because he's gonna have to admit himself there's right he's gonna have to bring it in fail see cuz he's a human being all right I just giggle and say okay Lord bless the brother let him go you know no problems but now listen see without a prophet to understand you and I would have no answers for any of it no more than the theologians would have now you read up on your theological side or read up on the mankind of Genesis 1:26 and 27 you might in some way find terminologies or thoughts coming that it was finally that man Dyer was put into 2:7 basically you'd find them to say in 2:7 is the man of 1:26 and 27 all right but what about a prophet and the way he explained it but that's been the hardest thing because I spent 40 something years expressing this one thought that God breathed into Adams and Austral eternal life go find somebody will explain it to you like that in the message or out of the message oh you're getting sarcastic no I'm just telling the truth about it how many times have you ever heard that Adam had eternal life and especially when you going over a little father that Adam fell from eternal life did you see God's Word is true but there's no way you'll find those understandings in your theological realms or the lines or anything but you go to a simple prophet and let him explain it so he explains God in his condescending he explains it's not another God or another another person he doesn't move over into another position what he just moves over as another form Father Son and Holy Ghost you can't understand one God without father son and holy go come on are you trying to do away with father son Holy Ghost try to be a oneness no you you you can't understand one God without father son and holy God God who's the creator and who doesn't want you got to have Father Son and Holy Ghost to understand the one true and living God your prophet said he's not a Trinity but he said he's a triune being he didn't said Trinity of beings he said a triune being a trial and being means one being with many manifestations we would have never got that from the intellectual side that when you moved to say Genesis 2:1 26 and 27 was Adam and that Adam in the Garden ruled the animals and the thing as in that theophany that word body that he was in a part of God I'm quoting from brother branham message after message a part of God come into being rather Bramley even explained how the word comes over and said that's a part of God how much more is it to see that Adam the Genesis 1:26 man Adam was a part of God he puts that into human flesh and that's what he wanted to do with every one of us to start us off right so how did he start Adam off okay lemon we'll go ahead brothers will pick up let's go to number three I hope you followed what I'm talking about the prophet of God said he took the 126 man put him in to the to seven the to seven to 126 is let us make man in our image or likeness and let them have dominion and he created two seven says the Lord God formed of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul now every body by natural birth is a living soul right that's the difference in the human and their animals are none we have the soul all right when the baby is born God breathes the breath of life into that baby and it becomes a living soul but that's not eternal life there brother branham is so technical and I know it those everybody saw but he said it's not what nature doing he says what God does so now let's listen and get a thought he's explaining all right we're on go ahead the number uh should be on number three you're on number two let's go to number three all right this is taken from blasphemous names and he's explaining the difference with the breath that you breathe is not the soul that's what your your people believe some of them you know believe in that you you breathe out and you breathe in and everything breathes it's just a living it's just a soul it's just a solace and he's explaining that's not right all right now moving on up to where we get to the point see ya now take the scripture he's did they take the scripture that God breathed breath into his nostrils and he became a living soul see he says what was he before he breathed huh now come on down to where we can get to the point you read in between and it's this see cuz this is what he's doing he's expressing their argument is not right he said cause if you breathe in an animal breathe in and out you do back and forth he said that's not true now he's explaining but what's who he's explaining he's explaining God first creation Adam Adam was his first original creation now don't forget to thought then for Adam is the example creation that's what he wants out of me in you and when it's finished we read it out of here when this is finished that man will come forth the way he's supposed to come right when it's finished it'll come to that don't worry about it look what God did he breathed the breath of eternal life he's talking about Adam right amen he become a living soul that can't die and as I said we're gonna get here in a minute where he gets to see him he said Adam God well he's a matter of fact he says here he's so perfect in his statements that's what amazes me it amazes me to look at something and I'm reading it and I look at the Word of God my the wait a minute now there's something wrong because the statements not exactly true this way there's something ain't lining up and I go backwards and forth and all at once he looked down he's hey he was right you don't ever do that I just do two checking it out see what works you know I love to take this message and check it with the Bible I thought was supposed to do that you know I thought that was the way we don't understand it was a right word okay come on look what God did he breathed the breath of eternal life and he became a living soul a soul that can't die so Adam didn't get just life as a living soul that all mankind gets after the Fallen condition Oh dad for the following condition God can't breathe eternal life into your nostrils you have to have a new birth mother breath even though the church is worn by the breath of God we got to have we'll get to it but look and watch we're going to get into honey plum her elbows breathe the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal soul that was Adam and what's cause God breathed not what nature doesn't we thought nature when you say in nature done nature is just life that gives you life when you're born you spank the baby come yet we know God has to give it to you but he's explaining nature does that that's a form of nature but God's different God breed not what nature doing but what God did breathe the breath of life into his nostrils and he became a living soul then you say to me Adam died brother branham and so beautiful but remember before Adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him would you go to Genesis and look at it and just think on what he's saying see before Adam died Adam lived to be nine hundred and something years old I think that's right in it that's before he died so genesis 3:15 i'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the one the spiritually condition of the fall had come into existence but the natural thing had not though brother brems right you say brother branham that adam fail he died said what remember before adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him hallelujah those were before he knew is called a lamb to redeemed them that was a type he was a type Adam fell then the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils had become the breath of the eternal God now remember the words up here he become a living soul he can't die look then the lamb was provided for Adam because already and his nostrils had become the breath of the eternal God and he become a living soul he was a son of God now this breath is the African word Amalia and things senator to breathe that listen said why would we struggle for eternal life if that's the eternal soul breathed into by breath know the words of you that's breathing in and breathing out and animals breathing in now why do you search for you turn a lot that would mean you would have life why don't you search for it are you listening to it why would we struggle for eternal life that backfires brother see it just can't do it but God look at the word I like that and it took me a long time to find that word because I was trying to say but God especially I was trying to say especially because that was the thought in my mind was the quote is God especially it wouldn't look God specially not that expecially something out right a phone Adam breathe the breath of eternal life and he become an eternal person with God and he's explaining Adam and his coming look he had power like God now remember when the 1:26 man had the power in the garden right but then when he breathed into his nostrils become living so the natural man was standing there right the natural man had the ruling of the garden right not just the spiritual man as inside it was the whole man Adam was standing that ruler brother Brent said he's the ruler of the earth he said God's the ruler of heaven he said he's the child of God he's the son of God look he had power like God he was an amateur God he was God of the earth not God of heaven now God of the earth someday the sons of God will again become gods come on Jesus said so you did not written in your law okay so God breathed into Adams nostrils and he became a living soul now that doesn't happen to you and I remember that God don't breathe into our nostril to the baby and we become into the world with eternal life now don't go that far because you got all these doctrines in the message oh wow it was eternal you know they got all these things in the message you don't see I'm not fighting no denominational person out there I thought the people of this message I don't find her I thought me and you to keep me and you from getting caught up into these times but look what he says he said what you said would Adam died brother brother Brennan now how could a dumb die with eternal life now come on I'm not the one that's establishing Browns establishing that God especially in the specialty in the Adam give him eternal life and made him an eternal person now how can he fall if he's an eternal person what happened doctor what took place right there you can't take an eternal person and let them fall if you have eternal life today by the new birth there's no way that you could ever fall now you can die right you can die but he can't take away the eternal life you how Adam had eternal life nine hundred and some years eve had eternal life that's gonna be one that you ain't gonna live preacher don't like that one cuz it they want to women to be some garbage they want them to be secondary video they don't like it that they don't like him but if he was in Adam and theophany and Adam was eternal then he was eternal come on that's why I ended your services up I cry because the words I use but I do it so hard to try to get you to think brother Dale I've got eternal life I can't die you know that a lot of people years ago there was two brothers especially talked that they could never die physically they are dead they did but they talked they couldn't I said well you're in bad shape say well how can a manifested Son of God died I said I don't know why don't you ask Adam and I said after all why don't you ask Jesus how he died right because they did but that's what we got to get to now see and I know we won't get to the full part of the message we're going which means me I'll be doing the preaching okay so we'll take care of that now what happened to Adam remember he was the example son he was to be Adam and Eve was to be the example children of God because they were the children of God they were the offspring of God in soul but their body was not eternal come on their body wasn't eternal cuz it was a creation any things creatives got two beginnings got a beginning it ain't eternal gotta be made eternal to have to be that all right so that's where Adam came what first as to 1:26 man Adam and Eve were both in that in the 1:26 called the Bible said let us make man and he made them not him them he made it male and female which would have been what God wanted to be but to follow came into being but now here's where you got to study with me for a second to think see we think well God's got all these attributes in him it had to be this way it had to be that way he didn't make it happen now you make him make it happen you got a problem mainly mental is that good enough don't make God making something happen we get through in time we'll get to it free moral agency puts us all that's why we're screaming at the end of the message Sunday afternoon don't you think that you're a Christian and you can't go out and do wrong you right in the devil's trial a born-again Christian can do wrong but they can't be lost but they can do wrong remember here's another one that the denomination I don't never food will brethren said a Christian is the only woman that can sin he said a sinner doesn't sin he's condemned on a higher level he's done to start with he said it's the Christian that has sins yeah but I'm Christian I don't sin that's where your liar that makes it a bigger Center in the building I like what we would it was a jackhole that said that time that lady told him said I have trouble with my tongue and things that I can't control it he said lady said this ain't enough room up here to put your tongue called this pulpits only 14 foot what you know across here ain't enough room to put your tongue in other words he was telling her she's she was lying like crazy but see we think Oh now remember a Christian a born-again Christian can never be lost get that settled never be lost you can never die and go to hell because you got to put eternal life into hell it won't work we can be taken off the scene because we won't straighten up because that's what the Bible says and many sleep all right don't ever get to the point of you think well I can't do wrong right there you've already done wrong we'll get to it eventually when we find out what the fault what the sin was what I'm trying to get you to look at Adam and to just see what Adam what he was the example child the way Adam was brought was God's intention to bring all mankind by the way you know all true born-again Christians but now also he knew and he had to plan and he knew the thing and there was attributes that had to be displayed of Savior healer etc you realized that if we were the only children of the children of God we're the only ones brought into being all these other people wouldn't be in the world there wouldn't be no foolish virgins there wouldn't be no people like that to be given eternal life just to Gail you just think one of these days somebody walk up to you and glory and say thank you thank you for accepting the word in the end time they because I wouldn't be here I'm just a foolish virgin I would just give an eternal life but if you hadn't have fallen if things hadn't went wrong that's not justifying falling no God knew was gonna do that but get the point brother Branham says blatt in blaspheme his name Adam fail Adam died he said he died all right now watch him let's go on up and pick up going up to number five let's get this and we'll try to finish it which is taken from the seal book on the breach we won't read all the way down but we'll pick it up as we go down because the Prophet is explaining what happened in the garden and what took place he says there's something lost miss groaning he's trying to get back in this original condition would you imagine somebody fouled in etc he said it's not in its original state man struck by disease just wrote it to keep rolling it struck by diseases aches and pains and groanings he's not in his right position everybody knows that I mean all right and he says what they're not in out to be conditioned they have fallen from somewhere yeah now watch him of what he explains paragraph 91 to the breach and you don't need anybody to interpret that forest for of course we know it was eternal life they had fallen from they they now watch that they they they because that day is gonna be you in a minute but they it who Adam and Eve they lost their claims on eternal life by the fall of Adam so that day is not just Adam and Eve but it would start with Adam and Eve day is you and me who fell from eternal life to death in the Garden of Eden and brought all nature under them to death now but you just you confuse me you just got to expound and expounding you found that a true born-again Christian that have eternal life can't fall and that's right what is ever born again believers still alive today what happened they died is that simple they died right and what's happening to you and me we're dying but you can't die in Seoul so now you've got to make a statement that's what people they differ with me about enough well we don't need nobody to explain it we just read what the Prophet says read what the Prophet said the Prophet said you could not die the Prophet said had a mid die now you've got a direct contradiction right there somewhere according to my English understanding I have a very small amount of English but according to wording I think that statement is right if you say you can't die and then say you can die that seems somewhere somebody's messed up well that's what I do I don't problem problem they'll fault with this for 40 50 years ain't worried about it now because this is what I thought 40 years ago from the same quote what that brother branham explains on blasphemous names which was prior to preaching the seals would have been 62 right in there somewhere less demon's name he explained that God breathed into the nostrils of Adam eternal life and he became an eternal person with God and the quote is dire he said and could not follow we see they caught it on the iron they brought it to his attention on that somebody enter code he picked it up maybe the congregation he said what you saying with brother branham Adam died he said before he died he had a lamb bra which would automatically seal him to the point that he couldn't be destroyed now listen and you know Adam wouldn't destroyed physically he said wait a minute I didn't say he didn't die and rotting went to the ground of the chemicals no that's all right but one day he's going to rage right in the body he's going to rage now you get to the shields message he says they've fallen from somewhere pull that back up notice these days they they they now because that means you but when he died as I said in the message this morning to saying he sold out our sold out our birthright and crossed this chasm now we're beyond the reach of God on this other side of the castle listen now of course when Adam fell to death he brought death upon all creation now he was giving given free more agency it was given to them as we sow to make a choice and Adam and Eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong before them and that same tree sets before each never one of us died on God isn't doing for Adam Eve see say he's doing an a lot it's not it's well it's their fault no no it's not their fault well I did God my God knows I can happen I sold I know it's your fault now come on you got to place it on yourself because right and wrong is set before you we're on the same basis as Adam and Eve okay now but what about that Adam and Eve fell to death okay they fell to death now what was the death they fell to now I'm going to use the terminology spread around use did you try to emphasize over and over he used on who is this Melchizedek you've talking about that theophany nothing like that and he said and you bypass that we'll see we want to try to make something like 285 oh you know well according to that you didn't by face it Lana you circled it that's just plain common language I'm calming myself but what happened Jesus came word to flesh no problem Adam came with eternal life breathed into his nostrils as he had stepped in to are put to 1:26 man into the 2:7 the natural man it didn't give that body eternal life as only the soul that was eternal so what didn't happen when the fall came into being I remember we got the scripture so we're going back on remember Adam wasn't deceived exactly rock or Adam knew exactly what he's doing what about a man knowing exactly what he's doing he done it you realize what that statement is making Adam knew what he's doing he knew that if he took Eve he was selling the whole human race to death already himself knowing he was dying knowing something had happened over there when things went wrong and God came down and talked to him so Adam was not deceived he knew what he was doing you want to I hear people and I'm not throwing on them people will say well he taught Christ and doing this that and the other that's okay that's that's fine but just be real careful how you have Adam type in Christ because you can't break it over because the people of this message bring it over that Adam injected into Eve his seed physically to save her now that's in the message people and a big portion of it and a lot of you know their names and them on the telephone numbers but that's the way they believe it I don't believe it that way mm-hmm you can't make it that way you can't make sex a savior I thought that was default I mean that was somewhere it got messed up on this thing you say but yet he took her brother Adam explain to Adam took her and held her yes I'll ask you a question while we're on the talk you say Adam done this and Adam done that and it saved Eve I would ask you to explain to me and would you mind telling me whether this is right or not that sin in the presence of God one split second and you're dead it don't have to be thirty minutes or an hour ride everybody with me you did right cause it's unbelief you did you don't have to go three days and then wind up being dead Adam from the minute he walked out of that garden he knew he was dying cuz you see it was an atom that preserved Eve I quoted this scripture to those some of those believers I thought that he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world I thought that's what took care of Adam and Eve from the point of the sin to the point that God could make the atonement now am i right if I'm not I'd like to explain that to me what took care of Adam and Eve from the time they send to the time that the atonement was made you see where you stand it you know you're guilty and you won't admit it you won't admit that that statement is right but it is seeing in the Fredericks of God one split second you're dead but you see there was a time element allows between the sin and the point of God making an atonement they wouldn't Adam it was God's almighty word that preserved both of them it didn't just preserve Adam it preserved them both because they were both standing there from the split second they done they were dying took a hundred unheard years read them to come to final death but that's fine just remember in between are the prophets said he made an atonement so you understand are you with me now and wasn't something somebody done to do this or done to do that he's got atonement himself he's won it ripped him skins off their manuals and placed him on Adam and Eve come on you know what brother Bryan said Adam and Eve was doing from the time that they had sinned there's over in the bushes you know what he said just do it having church and your tech quote he said they were over in the bush he's having church you know she was trying to convince Adam and she was right because he's still doing it now she the church is still trying to show how good it is what it is what this is what Evans does there I am lost now are you with me what I'm saying Adam then fell to natural death in the garden he didn't lose his soul he didn't lose eternal life in his soul and his body was not eternal right his body wasn't eternal his body was a creation so he fell to natural death not the death of the soul because you can't have eternal life and lose it well I kind of think you can look got a hipper thinking but listen see the difference between Adam and me and you a second oh thank you you know clear 5-point law see there's a difference between you and way me and you coming away Adam comment called Adam came word theophany put right in the flesh the fall brought us all to a lost condition so no matter who it is none of us are born with eternal life were born lost a psalmist explaining it morning's in shaping an iniquity espousing from the mother's womb and going forth a liar doomed it on our way to hell oh but I've always water turn well then I guess you're better off and Adam was just remember to have eternal life you must receive eternal life the natural life Burt breathed into you as a baby doesn't give you eternal life now come on you say well well well we got right well then why was Jesus's first doctrine what was Jesus's first doctrine come on looking at him this morning got him laying on the dead Jesus's first doctrine was you must be born again why would you must be born again if you already got to eternal life all you need to be born again well you just need to wake up find out always was eternal well help yourself you and ask me don't ever ask me brother Dale why are we still here 50 years after the prophets come don't ask me that if you don't want this just plain simple answer and for me to look right back at you and say it's your problem and my problem the reason we're here so just don't ask me because you know whose problem it is it's yours and it's mine well if I if we could get them women straightened up that's about a 1970 doctrine but what about it for Jesus came the word now listen he came from the Eternity 'he's into word form to create he come to Melchizedek and appeared as with a body spoken into existence and spoke out of existence but the Alpha knee can eat so it wouldn't the often II that was eating it was the outside man that God spoke into existence was eating so the prophet still rise he said but we see no more of him because he become Jesus Christ Jesus Christ had that fool 1:26 and 27 in his possession because he's the only possessor of eternal life he's the only one that can give eternal life he gave Adam eternal life in his soul yeah but you just you just yeah you just sound like a oneness when I say Jesus I mean Jesus Christ I don't mean Jesus the flesh I know Jesus the flesh people don't like this one really you know that brother Alan said Jesus his body had to be redeemed why cuz it had a beginning not because it was sinful it had a beginning it was made eternal in the resurrection we'll get down to what's the difference between him and you but just remember the difference between Adam and you you never come in that 1:26 man into any manifestation into any flesh then you'll see that Adam died in flesh he never died in his soul he never lost that soul he never lost the eternal life that God had given him that's God's example children why can't you believe it the end it what if it depend they hadn't have been no sin entered the picture well hypothetical calls who don't know Willis do it I like talking about what would happen had seen not entered the picture God would have brought us forth and taken the 1:26 part of man that we are and would have put it into human flesh and they were already in the garden a tree of life and we could have all got together and ate of the tree of life and the body would been made eternal and the world would have been laid eternal now is that not exactly what's happening you come into the world you lost your Center but you come to Christ Jesus is first doctrine Nicodemus you need to be born again you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior that gives you eternal life in your soul but it don't change the bodies or nothing but we're going as Adam and Eve would have been going to eat of the tree of life the Tree of Life is the Word of God this message is the Tree of Life had to be no sin we would all went to the Tree of Life and been made eternal but that would not have given my father the route of his attributes that he wanted and neither would have given a lot of other things so he didn't happen that way but what's the difference is happening now you're now coming and eating the Tree of Life this is the Tree of Life the statue of a perfect man you're eating the Word of God and your body will be made eternal by the words you eat may I quote brother branham Easter seal you become the word as you receive the word coming back to that word body that we're supposed to be in what not a word body over yonder a word body here if you have something over there as everybody wants to just remember that ain't gonna do you no good it's when you match here watch over there right when you match here what's over there you go over there rah that's simple he turned a lot Coen Brothers Adam received eternal life but his body he died you and I come into the world lost must be born again he took the fact that God would have to become a man to die to give his own life I asked you a question that crossed my mind ever want to go I asked you a question back here not too long ago I said you can see the spirit of Almighty God in the Old Testament and how to anoint a--does prophets and those people to do great things right you can see back there until is even the time or two that you can talk about a flesh because milk Shaare Zedek was caught into human flesh you can father a body but can you follow the soul because to be one true and living God to be right it's got to be father/son the whole to go and it's got to be the body spirit and soul can you follow the soul of Jesus Christ through the Old Testament see that's what I'm preaching it is not listening you don't paying attention cuz I just drop it in level I thought we believe the soul was the nature of the Spirit so then what are you looking for in the Old Testament the nature of Almighty God then you can see that nature would appear and you wouldn't kill the children of Israel because of this letter the other you can see the Hebrew children and the fourth man in the fire you can see all of those things as it takes you can see that atonement that was made is the very soul of Almighty God the very nature of God remember how he's bringing out the other day when job said wouldn't it Joe which one went down you know going to Tarsus Nineveh you know and he's if you'll read that real careful you catch something he told he told God he said you were not going to destroy them and I knew it and you knew it was he sent me down there bridge ababil he said you knew it and I knew it that you wouldn't don't destroy them thinking about the nature of listening in thinking we was the other day and now when you come down to Sodom and Abraham said my lord sit under that oak tree got some lease off of it he said God he says we can find 50 you won't destroy you find 50 won't destroy 40 30 20 10 what if he said 5 it had to end because the story couldn't went on any further and I wish you'd take my Bible and read my Bible it's the Scofield Bible it's not no different news but why would you find in that chapter they when he's dealing with him about 50 its capital L Ord forty is capital L Ord dirty twenty when you come down to ten it drops to the lowercase he's asking because then he knew the real man was standing there he starts off talking about a god up in heaven what's that it'll be capital letters but when he deals with God on earth it's always in a lowercase you know why Coast Guard has condescended listening God has condescended drop down toward we can understand the Lord said unto my lord sit down on the right handle I make thine enemies thy footstool those things means a lot when you look up the meaning of a word and it has capitalization to it you ever noticed in the book in the New Testament the word God has never spelled with a higher an uppercase but one time he said well it just starts the sentence well the Bible says God is the spirit and look at your Bible that's the lowercase but when he says over in Hebrews God who in Sundra times and divers matters he's talking about the very god of eternity he's now dealing with mankind and it goes down to verse three and he's spoken to us through his son now changes to a lowercase because he's here remember in your reading if you'll think about it when a man is praying and the things that happening he's talking about Lord it's up in the heavens but when he tell him to come down the lower case it'll be that God right there with him that angel I love words I love to think about God's Word see you and I came not the way God wanted us to come but in his finality it'll finish the way he wanted us to come what do we got go ahead anybody having a just a minute they were to pray for Wade this afternoon this is remember Wade this afternoon to be banging it's later than you think [Music] the bride is preparing for her [Music] [Applause] [Music] randomization in the New Testament because guys whether she had had the need in the evening time garden whether she he got up in heaven day he's right here with time to get us to see his word panting it is to see who we are what's taking place you'll find one time when the word Jesus is used it's in capitalization the reed right on down below it's about two verses lower it drops to a lower case because Jesus would Almighty God to descend he's hairy not somewhere that he's right with us [Music] - anybody have a name you dismiss dismember the services afternoon for one for another being his own [Music]
