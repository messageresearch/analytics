[2:47] to the place of understanding you
[2:49] because that's the main thing because we
[2:53] can understand you then all is well with
[2:54] us and father it's you that was trying
[2:58] to hit that is trying to reveal yourself
[3:00] into it and to make yourself manifest
[3:02] among us come down and do that tonight

[3:07] just bless each one bless those that are
[3:10] not here remember the reasons and take
[3:12] care of each one we love you and we
[3:15] commit everything into your hands we
[3:16] were hard to reach your word as we read
[3:19] your word then you come and speak to our
[3:21] hearts about that of what we need to say
[3:24] to the people have your way now and
[3:26] Goddess forgive our sins and cleanse us
[3:29] from all unrighteousness in Jesus name
[3:32] Amen now we're going to read six versus
[3:38] tonight we've been just reading the
[3:40] first three verses we're going to read
[3:41] Hebrews 6 we're going to read six verses
[3:44] therefore leaving the principles of the
[3:47] doctrine of Christ let us go on unto
[3:50] perfection not laying again the
[3:52] foundation of repentance from dead works
[3:54] and a faith toward God of the doctrine
[3:58] of baptisms and of laying on of hands
[4:00] and a resurrection of the Dead none of
[4:02] eternal judgment and this will we do if
[4:05] God permit part is not possible for
[4:09] those who were once enlightened and have
[4:11] tasted of the heavenly gift and we're
[4:14] protected mayport acres from the Holy
[4:16] Ghost and I've tasted the good word of
[4:18] God and the powers of the world to come
[4:20] if they shall fall away to renew them
[4:22] again in repentance seeing that
[4:24] crucified to themselves to some got a
[4:27] fresh and put him to an open shame
[4:31] and you may be seated below head is
[4:33] blessing to the reading of the word now
[4:36] the this a very odd statement to make
[4:40] Wood Brothers please give those that
[4:44] that the Apostle Paul here is making to
[4:47] us we've covered a couple of messages
[4:50] about it trying to get an understanding
[4:53] and to see that we've had to go on in
[5:00] the Word of God now Paul was not saying
[5:07] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[5:09] of Christ in other words let's destroy
[5:11] this let's get rid of that we don't need
[5:13] that anymore in no way could he say that
[5:17] when he was saying that the word you
[5:21] know there is the only thing that can
[5:24] take care of us but what did we find
[5:27] that he's saying he's saying that we
[5:32] must go on and not sit down on something
[5:37] in the Prophet called it that she look
[5:40] he said the Pentecost was cabbage down
[5:42] on the gift sometimes me and go on to
[5:47] perfection huh I mean that we we
[5:51] realized that he's speaking of a place
[5:54] or something to attain unto that were
[6:00] not at because when you say you know let
[6:03] us go on unto perfection it means that
[6:07] you're not at the place that you're
[6:10] saying are you wouldn't say let us go on
[6:12] you would say we're here you know we're
[6:16] here perfection p and he wasn't saying
[6:19] that and the prophet of God comes along
[6:22] and verifies the things to us that you
[6:25] know showing us the perfection that we
[6:30] need to go home unto all right now
[6:34] there's a rapture to be had in this last
[6:36] days you know a card away a change of
[6:41] these vile bodies you see we have enough
[6:44] time
[6:44] that yet All Right see what your
[6:48] sensible people we're not trying to do I
[6:50] remember years ago Amanda a big man you
[6:53] know to have it big name he comes lives
[6:56] hard row out and fixed it all up this
[6:57] way and begin to preach what they called
[7:00] in mortality in the flesh but you know
[7:03] that didn't make him a day younger no I
[7:06] mean that didn't happen one bit he could
[7:09] try to make it look good you can get
[7:11] facelifts not like that and that's your
[7:13] business i'm not wrong it's wrong to do
[7:16] I'm just saying that it's not going to
[7:19] make you any younger to get face-lift
[7:22] you know if they ever find a place to be
[7:25] able to change lives may be with my be
[7:28] able to you know we might talk about
[7:31] something to flop around but it's not
[7:35] going to do any good you know you can
[7:37] make yourself look younger and do
[7:39] whatever you want to but it doesn't make
[7:41] you a day younger they just miss to do
[7:43] it but the Apostle Paul was as I've
[7:46] tried to explain in no way was he saying
[7:51] leaving the pretzels of the doctor and a
[7:54] crashing and go like we think the
[7:58] because you can't leave the principles
[8:01] are the beginnings they will always be
[8:04] with you because they're the foundation
[8:07] that we stand on the one guard to water
[8:11] baptism the need the things but we must
[8:14] go on because if we don't go on then we
[8:20] can never see the truth of what has been
[8:24] tried to be said unto us you know that
[8:28] we need to to obtain to a higher place I
[8:34] gave you a quote in there where brother
[8:36] and said Powell's wanted he never wanted
[8:38] to stay in one place he wanted to travel
[8:41] on so that's the way it should be in the
[8:43] gospel our desire should be always to
[8:47] advance further and never
[8:50] to come to the place of sitting down and
[8:52] saying hey we've got it oh man we've got
[8:56] it could see that's what happened during
[8:59] the other ages but around instead of
[9:02] spirit got among the people in the days
[9:04] of Martin Luther and said that spirit
[9:07] begins to say we have the word now let's
[9:11] get it together and let's form an
[9:15] organization and let's print up what
[9:19] Luther has told the lest it get away
[9:23] from us well let let's do it but he said
[9:27] that was where they went wrong because
[9:29] see then they cabbage down the wit and
[9:31] they said Luther said this Luther said
[9:34] this Luther's the disc you might have
[9:36] said anything we don't know anything
[9:37] about that we just know what Luther said
[9:40] Lucy wouldn't that to save situation
[9:42] that existed when the Lord Jesus came
[9:45] that the scribes and Pharisees said we
[9:48] know what Moses said we know where he's
[9:50] at what he's doing but you we don't know
[9:53] and no matter what sign under wonders
[9:56] could be done before the people it would
[9:59] not convert it now that's something in
[10:03] it that even like Nicodemus admitting
[10:07] and saying we know that you're a teacher
[10:09] come from God admitted that the things
[10:15] he done could not be done by man but yet
[10:19] where would they turn then you believe
[10:20] it could we be in that same class can we
[10:25] set down there our cabbage down and say
[10:27] well we at lula now we have a great
[10:29] understanding of the message so we'll
[10:31] just relax and wait on everybody else to
[10:33] catch up with us my bud you got a
[10:36] problem there no I don't believe your
[10:39] tongue way I believe we need to keep
[10:41] continuing on I believe that not another
[10:45] message now not something out of the
[10:48] Prophet to come I believe that we need
[10:50] to progress in
[10:52] the word of the hour that we have in our
[10:56] you know giving them to us the tapes the
[10:59] books the thing and keep on going cuz
[11:02] I've never found that to run out yet you
[11:05] know 40 something years of preaching out
[11:08] of it I never found out you know
[11:10] anything about that it would go wrong I
[11:13] found it to keep on opening the word
[11:17] that it would would have made art but
[11:20] that's what we've been trying to say men
[11:23] and listen even to their Sunday now
[11:28] trying to bring a point out of no I'll
[11:30] get back to it later in the message we
[11:32] have time the prophet of God he said
[11:36] everything you have need us in your
[11:39] journey is in you when you receive a new
[11:43] birth well bless God I got it getting
[11:47] you Burt don't need stay don't need to
[11:49] pray I don't know they sup wrongly
[11:53] something wrong we mentally then because
[11:58] how could you say those things when the
[12:02] Holy Spirit the Prophet says is in you
[12:04] weigh on you to bring him the word well
[12:11] we just sat down a relaxed are we we've
[12:13] got the message in the hour huh but
[12:17] let's don't let this message become you
[12:19] know stale you remember what happened
[12:21] with the children of Israel they were
[12:24] given the manner they would go out and
[12:25] they would you know the matter was on
[12:27] the ground i'll head news gathering you
[12:30] see they got a little scared and they
[12:31] said well we better get there is enough
[12:32] for tomorrow coast we might not get any
[12:34] tomorrow so they gathered xtreme put it
[12:37] up you know what happened it rotten the
[12:40] very manner that would life-giving
[12:42] became rotten men will you mean to say
[12:48] the word are rotten I didn't say that i
[12:51] said the fact that we would try to hold
[12:54] it over when god says don't do that we
[12:59] are the ones that make it rotten you
[13:02] remember how we were trying to bring out
[13:04] that did works we all called it dead
[13:08] works there in Hebrews 6 and Hebrews 9
[13:10] boo he called it dead works what the
[13:14] doctrine of baptisms and one God do the
[13:17] things like the truth he called it dead
[13:19] works the prophet of God called it
[13:23] carnal reform then how can you call the
[13:28] Word of God carnal reform how can you
[13:31] call how could poll call the truth of
[13:34] those things dead works something must
[13:41] be it must be being said to us that we
[13:46] need to study very carefully because it
[13:51] seemed like he would just say it works
[13:53] we just returned universal that were you
[13:58] know repentance from dead works you mean
[14:02] the revealed Word of God is that works
[14:04] no Paul is not saying that brother
[14:08] branham is not saying that you
[14:11] understand that is not dead works its
[14:15] principles this foundation mean but you
[14:21] can't go away from that all of those
[14:24] things are necessary because it's got to
[14:30] go on all right it's gotta got to go to
[14:34] a place to where that we can can look at
[14:40] it what you see look at number two in
[14:42] your notes where I gave it to you car
[14:44] brought around says it like this when
[14:49] Paul is reading that scripture let us go
[14:50] on unto perfection but about this
[14:55] message the sons of God 1965 and 18 what
[14:58] does the word unto me it means there
[15:02] something we're coming to unto so let us
[15:07] go unto own on
[15:10] to perfection that's the time of the
[15:14] message not let us go on unto perfection
[15:17] always trying to explain me that these
[15:25] things that we have are wonderful but we
[15:30] must go on and I just sat down and say
[15:35] you know oh we got it we got it let's
[15:39] write up the books we got it we got the
[15:40] prophets message now in every language
[15:42] in the world almost let's just say I on
[15:46] man wait no and thank God for those
[15:54] people that are putting out the books
[15:55] and the science where would you and I be
[15:59] had they not put them out but if that's
[16:03] all they know then what is that would
[16:10] that not turn out to be dead work cuz
[16:16] it'd be something you can do hmmm what
[16:19] see I say again where would we be if
[16:21] they're not done that thank God for the
[16:24] people that are putting out the books in
[16:26] bed maybe that's their job but that's
[16:29] not your job in line our job is to go on
[16:35] do not let that lazy leave you know in
[16:38] this setback and do it it is to go home
[16:43] the great Apostle Paul that well known
[16:47] in his message to preach and tell us of
[16:50] a change of the body no Lord exceptional
[16:55] that said from him on the shot voice of
[16:56] an archangel Trump forgot all of those
[16:58] scriptures explaining those things to us
[17:02] which you know he never attained to that
[17:04] position yet he saw it my revelation run
[17:11] around and look at all in what he
[17:12] preached but yet he never tied to these
[17:15] in the grave now waiting on you and I
[17:17] right hmm I mean whatever you say he's
[17:21] waiting home hey this he's in the
[17:23] grave no of course not a lot of people
[17:27] don't believe that day they believed you
[17:28] could go Brenda get up you wouldn't be
[17:29] tonight we'll see some work I mean yeah
[17:33] you know all right I'm not towing
[17:36] oakstone did anybody just trying to tell
[17:38] the truth Oh even though he explained to
[17:43] those things but he never reached that
[17:46] one because he was not permitted to do
[17:49] it right God didn't permit into my cuz
[17:54] they without us cannot be made perfect
[17:58] see then we got to go on he permitted
[18:02] him to see the things he saw right which
[18:09] Peter says are hard to understand
[18:13] greater things in the Apostle Peter so
[18:17] the Apostle Paul's all those and spoke
[18:19] to us about it but yet he was not
[18:22] permitted to go into the change at that
[18:26] time but he put him in a place the word
[18:34] that he was telling us the truth now I
[18:41] looked this up because I know a lot of
[18:44] times they can be a little difference in
[18:45] variation in things and I looked at that
[18:49] word let us go on to perfection all
[18:53] right now we say the word perfect is
[18:58] completing a full age that's fine I'm
[19:01] sorry oh that's what it is that's what
[19:02] it means perfection all right but that
[19:05] word is I got a little different meaning
[19:07] to it because watch what it is its
[19:09] number 50 51 in your strongest concourt
[19:13] it means now this word perfection means
[19:17] finisher
[19:22] a perfect term one who has in his own
[19:30] person raised forth to his perfection so
[19:41] that applies to possible problem he had
[19:45] raised for it in his day to the
[19:47] perfection but yet that was not enough
[19:53] to bring about their resurrection rector
[19:59] see so it's left up to someone else but
[20:04] a random would be like that he would be
[20:07] the prefecture one who within his own
[20:10] revelation received and saw all the way
[20:14] through the Bible the entire word and
[20:16] increased it in to us even all the way
[20:18] to the future home but yet he had to go
[20:24] out of the grave I'm because he was not
[20:29] permitted to go on but now listen don't
[20:33] misunderstand me the old people saw it
[20:38] just as though it was taking drugs when
[20:44] something is revealed to you as far as
[20:48] you're concerned as far as God is
[20:49] concerned you already had it right when
[20:54] Paul spoke in there in prophecy of the
[20:57] rapture in his spiritual condition of
[21:01] existence in the new birth he saw that
[21:04] just like it was real right there in
[21:06] front of it that's language speak like
[21:10] he would run around him what he would
[21:15] see something it was just exactly like
[21:16] that he would see it right there in
[21:19] front of it but yet he would have to
[21:23] come back to her earthly existence when
[21:26] he went beyond the curtain of time he
[21:31] but when I was finished in God was true
[21:34] with him done he had to come back and
[21:39] wait to a time that then he could go
[21:42] back beyond the curtain of time could I
[21:44] believe that's where he went we when he
[21:46] was killed her in the car rack no cheer
[21:48] what they see Paul was saying I don't
[21:58] have this so let us go on to that
[22:04] position you could see it it's like it
[22:09] would be standing right there but yet he
[22:13] says let us go home so if they say let
[22:17] us go it mean that you're not tired now
[22:25] what Paul needed was to live down to
[22:31] this time good I believe in this time
[22:34] you have must come to the place that we
[22:40] must reach that perfection within
[22:43] ourselves no not within ourselves like
[22:47] you know the ability to do it now don't
[22:49] misunderstand me there is no perfection
[22:53] outside of Jesus Christ you and I'll
[22:56] never be perfect I don't care how good
[22:58] you think you are you can think you're
[23:03] so goody-goody whatever you do you take
[23:04] your kids as goody-goody but just
[23:06] remember like I've always told you my
[23:09] kids and my grandkids and my great
[23:10] grandkids you know what their halo is
[23:13] held up by horns you know what
[23:17] metalworks you know what I mean there
[23:21] were kids kids are going to be kids
[23:23] didn't act like kids and do that kids
[23:25] God you did oh don't thank you as a
[23:28] goodie tissue no but see don't give us
[23:34] no excuse to run off and say well mom
[23:36] and daddy does so now much do it no need
[23:38] to get born again
[23:39] cuz we got morning even if your whole
[23:41] time all right all said that there's a
[23:48] place that someone will come to and like
[23:52] I've tried to tell you over and over
[23:53] Paul was trying his best to get out of
[23:57] the people's mind that Jesus Christ was
[23:59] coming right then cut he said he's gotta
[24:01] be a falling away and that falling away
[24:06] must come and only when the falling away
[24:08] qanskan these things take place just
[24:14] like where I read there in Hebrew sick
[24:15] yeah let us go on to perfection look at
[24:19] the very next time and whilst will do it
[24:22] got from it fart is impossible for those
[24:25] who were once enlightened and tasted the
[24:27] heavenly gift I remember when I first
[24:31] found that I thought because seaweed
[24:33] always thought and it's got that meaning
[24:35] to it did you know if we send will fly
[24:39] to receive the knowledge of the truth
[24:40] ever remains no more sacrifice and we'd
[24:42] be lost if we tasted the heavenly gift
[24:46] like a borderline believer the Old
[24:49] Testament then we'd be lost but then one
[24:53] day I read it like the Prophet when he
[24:55] told me in the Hebrew book page 215 I'm
[24:58] like a good rhythm Obama here he said
[25:02] Paul was saying it's impossible for a
[25:06] Christian to follow the money now that's
[25:12] going on to perfection
[25:19] that's going on to perfection to find
[25:22] out that you can be lost if you're ever
[25:26] bored any well then brother dev I'm born
[25:30] again itís girl in like I want to now
[25:32] you've proven you're a born again that
[25:33] solves that problem there's no arguments
[25:36] no discussion involved because everybody
[25:41] that would have every season you were
[25:44] has within them the person of Jesus
[25:46] Christ that wants to go on to perfection
[25:50] right never born again believer I was
[25:57] saying what I've got listen he's only a
[26:04] part of why i prophesied about because
[26:11] he didn't tell you I'll never attained
[26:15] of the change of the body right right
[26:17] come on he went to the grave he's still
[26:20] in the grey down but he said why I've
[26:25] got he's a park and there's no way in
[26:31] the world could he say what we think he
[26:34] said we think it he's calling it some
[26:37] kind of dead work when you got a
[26:39] revelation 21 through and living God
[26:41] that's not dead works but if we cab
[26:48] these down what we believe today and
[26:50] stop progressing you prove that we've
[26:54] got dead workers see Paul had a new
[27:00] birds when he was saying this so it's
[27:03] not just the new bird he said we brought
[27:07] it in what it was then the new bird
[27:09] makes you perfect I agree with you but
[27:13] why would Paul say that when he had a
[27:16] new birth my when he said go on to
[27:20] perfection when he had a new birth so he
[27:25] must be meaning i need to go all-in what
[27:27] I've already got
[27:28] I we've already got I've got the new
[27:35] birth I must go on it's my Peter with
[27:38] the statue of perfect man pointing back
[27:39] here behind it what is Peter saying
[27:44] growing in grace and knowledge going on
[27:48] to perfection going up the statue of a
[27:51] perfect man when you're born again by
[27:54] the new birth that makes you so perfect
[27:58] the brother brad says he only have the
[28:01] artists you got go on to perfection
[28:07] blowing up the statue of a perfect man
[28:10] glowing in what we call adoption in no
[28:16] way could probably be calling those
[28:18] things did work as something like wait
[28:21] think about it go on what go on to the
[28:29] rapture right are they gave you the cool
[28:33] pair of number one choice your father
[28:35] preach the night to end 53 907 where I
[28:40] gave it to you our Sunday where he said
[28:44] the rapture is in you now yeah but but
[28:50] but how could he say that 53 when the
[28:52] message hadn't come yet that was the
[28:56] message a man that was part of the
[28:59] message what he corrected is to not be
[29:05] part of the word that he preached we
[29:09] must accept that but if he didn't gret
[29:12] those times we must accept the fact that
[29:15] it must be true right so let us go on
[29:20] that's what they were doing that night
[29:24] Peter said ought to go there of like
[29:27] precious faith he said I've got that new
[29:30] birth but now let's go on right to
[29:33] perfection let's go on in the growth
[29:36] develop
[29:36] right good Paul in him I'll never preach
[29:41] the seals he never even mentioned me son
[29:45] of man he didn't race receives a night
[29:51] that was to be the end time that was to
[29:57] come down to this bag rapture with in
[30:03] motion back there yet just like I tried
[30:06] my best to preach for weeks and weeks
[30:08] and weeks about the coming of the Lord
[30:09] they started the second coming of the
[30:12] Lord Siva started work on the death
[30:14] penalty in that view birth but it's got
[30:20] a lot to do with it there's still
[30:21] unfolding see then Paul bringing it out
[30:30] to go on that's that was the thing about
[30:34] what to do could we don't go on we're
[30:38] the ones that makes it colonel that work
[30:40] came in we make it those things if we
[30:46] don't continue to go on me Luther's
[30:50] message was going on for the time you
[30:55] had to be in his message but when West
[30:59] become long preaching sanctification and
[31:02] you reject that then what you have
[31:07] turned out to be carnal reform or did
[31:12] work you understand what I'm trying to
[31:15] bring the message that we have claimed
[31:20] to believe can be the very thing that
[31:22] will destroy us if we don't go on and
[31:30] bring forth and manifest but it's for
[31:36] the hour that we're living if you don't
[31:39] get nothing out of the message that's
[31:40] what I want you to say we've got to
[31:44] continue your own in the message
[31:49] because we don't it will become stale
[31:56] it's time we got to go on I've got a
[32:02] kind of like a Bible of 26 translations
[32:05] and it shows you the things and you know
[32:08] where there's any difference in what one
[32:10] would say the other one is what to give
[32:11] it listen to what this stretcher says
[32:14] about in Hebrew six about going to
[32:17] perfection listen what it said and go
[32:19] forward to adult understanding right
[32:25] let's go on to perfection on unto it
[32:30] means you're not dr. like the prophet
[32:32] has given you a while to go where he
[32:33] said let us go into let us go into the
[32:36] water fountain that means you're not at
[32:37] the water family let us go on to the
[32:42] ridership and go forward to a dot
[32:44] understanding another one says and it
[32:48] passed on to our full growth another
[32:55] rider these are different Bibles since
[32:58] we let us advance to mature manhood
[33:04] that's what they interpreted as Paul is
[33:07] saying let us go on unto perfection and
[33:13] when they put it in their Bible they put
[33:15] it there see let us advance to mature
[33:17] manhood like I said about Paul standing
[33:23] there even though he could look forward
[33:25] into the future and see those things and
[33:31] come back and talk about some of it some
[33:33] of it he couldn't come back on you take
[33:35] it up into the third heaven and Brett
[33:37] around said I believe Paul was taking
[33:39] his earth he said I believe I only went
[33:41] to the first Hammond also these things
[33:46] here I can't tell you but he told us a
[33:49] lot of times we see when talking about
[33:54] let us go on you wouldn't try to get
[33:57] people
[33:58] converting to going to perfection you
[34:01] gotta get to being perfect before you go
[34:03] into perfection is it does that give you
[34:09] understanding what I'm trying to say you
[34:12] gotta have some place to start from so
[34:16] then you would throwing away the
[34:17] principles they're the very foundation
[34:21] that we rest on but let's don't diss
[34:25] keep on the foundation I gave you one
[34:28] quote in our somewhat lessly this number
[34:32] seven on your note we run around said we
[34:34] spend too much time studying on the
[34:36] principles too much time studying on the
[34:43] pretzels we need to go on to perfection
[34:49] but go on in the word d well didn't stay
[34:56] with your preaching one God water
[34:59] baptism no eternal hell what he went out
[35:02] and got open the seals in the open the
[35:08] seals to him he brought the message of
[35:10] the entire Bible interview when he
[35:14] brought that message into view of the
[35:16] entire Bible that was the thing the
[35:19] world has been waiting home that's the
[35:21] thing not let me see the world no I'm
[35:23] talking about the bride the thing the
[35:27] bride has been waiting on is the opening
[35:32] of the word but then you come in to
[35:35] question it the message even turn out to
[35:38] be dead works like I said the other day
[35:41] you talk to people about this message we
[35:44] don't need to understand and see of them
[35:45] design which is simple who is just
[35:50] simple well it becomes dead works we
[35:56] don't need to understand Daniel 70 weeks
[35:57] and in adoption and stature perfect man
[36:01] we don't need no standing fine we just
[36:05] need to be good Christians well then
[36:08] that's what your profits a waste
[36:09] in too much time studying the principles
[36:15] look the things that should be our
[36:18] foundation it's like I told you when i'm
[36:21] talking about the foundational part when
[36:24] you pour a foundation for a house you
[36:28] don't just keep pouring more foundations
[36:30] and more foundation after a while you
[36:33] get enough foundation lavigne if you
[36:37] don't get enough you got a problem goes
[36:41] in a cracking good but you let down the
[36:45] way they tell you to you put the rebar
[36:49] bein you put the six or eight into the
[36:51] concrete or what it required now for a
[36:54] foot in 24 inches wide or something you
[36:57] can build a good house on top of there
[36:59] unless something goes wrong do you hope
[37:03] why because it's been proven tested that
[37:06] access your foundation one God water
[37:12] baptism no eternal hell all that the
[37:18] prophets message up until you know the
[37:20] preaching up until 63 that's wonderful
[37:25] we need that in place we've got how that
[37:27] in place run around the seals would have
[37:32] never broke to that profit if you had
[37:34] not been standing in the word where the
[37:36] Apostle Paul had reached it would not
[37:44] open then you got people in the message
[37:48] you know what they say well the son of
[37:50] the Meseta the Son of Man comes straight
[37:54] to profit out literally like right
[37:58] around had it all wrong and all it wants
[38:00] something happened and somebody else
[38:02] come along straightening out within
[38:03] people started wanting to be who that
[38:05] was you know they started doing that and
[38:07] they can straighten out to message you
[38:10] know and they're still doing it around
[38:11] the world you know and they're telling
[38:14] you where the fallacies is that and the
[38:16] things that's wrong with the message now
[38:19] wonder people don't want this message
[38:21] but you going the internet run it up and
[38:24] look and see what kind of a garbage cans
[38:26] comes out in front of you me I'm sure
[38:30] some of you've done that but you don't
[38:33] have two scarecrows to try to keep you
[38:35] away from the real truth what you see
[38:39] through the opening of the seals come
[38:42] the full complete revelation of the Lord
[38:45] Jesus Christ runarounds message I
[38:49] preached it to you over and over go to
[38:51] the rapture message listen he said when
[38:53] this message would come forward but as
[38:56] message was not he had to preach those
[38:59] things before he could preach his
[39:01] message but his message begun in the
[39:02] opening of the seal it lasted only for
[39:08] about three years now hmm because that's
[39:13] the way the Lord Jesus was he's ministry
[39:16] on her life to about three and a half
[39:17] years would you see he's not doing away
[39:24] with something the understand we say
[39:28] leaving the principles that's not doing
[39:29] away with that when we don't need that
[39:32] anymore and run around would say that
[39:34] when he said we put too much studying on
[39:37] the principles what was he saying we
[39:40] need to go on to perfection alright but
[39:44] then he went to the next jerk d 1 d
[39:49] preach principled why because that turf
[39:53] didn't understand he said I wish we had
[39:58] time to stay here for a while you go to
[40:02] another turf what happened dude he kept
[40:05] laying principle plan because those
[40:07] people couldn't understand who when he
[40:10] come back to the tabernacle he's a
[40:13] capricious names out there
[40:19] he says you can't go out there and tell
[40:21] those people they've done he said cuz
[40:23] they don't believe it he would go out
[40:28] there and speak about the new birds in
[40:29] one God and water baptism yes because he
[40:32] didn't break down on it but then he come
[40:36] back to the tabernacle and preach great
[40:39] sermons then he have to be after the
[40:42] opening of the seals and he got into the
[40:44] message then he was running out of time
[40:46] and he started on his travels and he was
[40:50] on his travels he began to preach
[40:52] greater messages out dire one cuz he's
[40:57] running out of time he was trying to get
[41:02] us the message to were you and I can go
[41:06] on to perfection right all right first
[41:11] Corinthians 13 sin said Kim says what
[41:14] when that which is perfect is come that
[41:19] which is in part is done away what up
[41:24] none away that's what no that's not what
[41:29] it's talking about no more than leaving
[41:33] the principles means to throw it away no
[41:35] it's not saying that they see where
[41:41] these prophecies they shall fail well we
[41:43] don't need prophecies anymore then cuz
[41:45] they fail no we're supposed to go on if
[41:51] we're speaking in tongues today and
[41:52] that's wonderful and a part of the gift
[41:55] but we need to go on the Bible says what
[41:59] seek the most earnest and gift never
[42:05] stop that which is perfect is come then
[42:13] that which is in part is done away not
[42:15] done way like destroyed that's what it
[42:19] sounds like then so we don't need that
[42:23] anymore we do with that numb
[42:28] same profit that said we need to go home
[42:30] to the church without the gills will
[42:32] have to answer good work can you do away
[42:37] with anything of God well we don't need
[42:42] that I'm over without where did that
[42:44] come from that didn't come from me and
[42:46] that didn't come from God go we need
[42:50] everything God give show me where he
[42:53] ever took it away when he gave it to us
[42:58] show me where it took he took it away
[43:00] even a man come here one time he's
[43:03] preaching and he said the bread around
[43:06] said took a piece of paper written this
[43:09] is five fold ministry said Brett around
[43:11] said I full ministry nucleus blade up on
[43:13] the shelf well I didn't understand that
[43:19] first off because he claimed to be one
[43:21] of them and he went land up on the shelf
[43:24] he's up on the pulpit talking right so
[43:29] if you won't let on she'll get rid of it
[43:30] you know that's what you mean me that's
[43:33] only time I ever seen brother moment
[43:35] when he interrupted ebuddy you need is
[43:37] slightly told that brother he said hold
[43:39] it brother we don't agree with that
[43:41] because the fivefold ministry is to stay
[43:44] until the Lord Jesus come let's see the
[43:48] helm you just fold it up do it well why
[43:51] didn't he shut up I get kind of tickled
[43:55] at preachers you know I'm pretty sure
[43:57] they've come up to the pulpit well I'm
[43:59] the least one here and I but it I guess
[44:03] it just fell not a lot well said shut up
[44:07] did somebody hard like that's fake cuz
[44:12] they're not meaning that way they're not
[44:14] being sincere they're trying to show you
[44:16] that all it once you see them
[44:18] straightening out everybody right tell
[44:24] you what wrong in your eyes the letter
[44:28] words he too now they got to start with
[44:32] but give one save
[44:36] dunaway is not to be destroyed and that
[44:44] which is perfect is come then which is
[44:48] in part is done way now listen I heard
[44:51] that explained this way when they which
[44:56] is perfect is coming to straighten out
[44:57] every time I'm all right it was
[45:04] straighten out everything that's good we
[45:08] won't do away any time you ever start
[45:12] trying to do away with you thank God put
[45:14] in the body you've been doing away with
[45:18] part of the body that wouldn't work well
[45:25] that which is in part is that when the
[45:28] people wouldn't do they have exactly
[45:30] right okay on three that's time they
[45:32] didn't have it exactly right now I don't
[45:34] believe that's what it say I believe it
[45:39] saved just what it said in Hebrew sick
[45:41] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[45:43] the Christ let us go on to perfection
[45:46] when that which is perfect is come then
[45:51] that which is in part will fit into that
[45:57] you won't be annihilated it'll fit into
[46:01] that Martin Luther's message or the just
[46:07] shall live by faith sits right in the
[46:09] seals I think said no we don't lean on
[46:13] that there's wrong back there are no the
[46:17] message to the just shall live by faith
[46:18] wouldn't wrong it was God's Word it is
[46:23] the very foundation you and I stand on
[46:26] is the message you'll Martin Luther the
[46:29] truth what you see that's where people
[46:32] try to twist it all look I gave you
[46:35] where the Prophet said number nine of
[46:37] your notes paragraph 105 question that's
[46:41] your 6480 23
[46:44] he said we have the perfect
[46:51] interpretation of the word of God with
[46:58] divine vindication are you ridden he
[47:08] said we have the perfect interpretation
[47:15] of the word of God looking at the next
[47:19] one way there when that which is perfect
[47:26] is made known there was a day that run
[47:36] around didn't have the perfect
[47:37] interpretation of the opening of the
[47:39] seals he said well he knew everything
[47:42] when he come well I thought I'd he said
[47:44] he didn't so I believe him he said he
[47:47] was fixing to preach that first seal
[47:49] wrong because the Holy Ghost had coming
[47:51] corrected it he said I don't know what
[47:55] the second seal is third fourth field
[47:58] he's gonna preach it wrong on the first
[48:01] one so it don't look like he must
[48:04] understood every time my because it had
[48:10] open them to it it hadn't been made
[48:15] known you can't go home now listen jerk
[48:21] you can't go on to perfection until
[48:25] professor it brought him to view in
[48:27] front of you it's time to be made known
[48:35] better instead back there and told us
[48:37] that you Burke you have that makes your
[48:40] soul that's it perfect is guardian we
[48:45] said now we got to go on woman why go on
[48:49] like Peter said of the statue of a
[48:50] perfect man through what through the
[48:53] opening of the word
[48:56] is why I so vital to break the word see
[49:01] if you can't breach it he can't be
[49:04] before the faithful and it certainly is
[49:09] not like a carrot stuck out in front of
[49:11] a donkey to try to get him to pull away
[49:16] it's the opening of the Word of God the
[49:23] Word of God was not opening his fullness
[49:25] until that profit stood on this earth
[49:28] the Lord Jesus had preached it yes but
[49:33] no one knew what it was he preached the
[49:36] seals in Matthew 24 right read your
[49:39] Bible Jesus pretty slick sale Matthew 24
[49:42] but who you were that was sir i read
[49:48] that before then and we talked about it
[49:50] we talked about the sixth seal being the
[49:52] tribulation forever coming this message
[49:57] we talk to men but why didn't we know
[50:02] about it those things we could read see
[50:10] that which is perfect had not come when
[50:14] that prophet walked out that and
[50:16] preached the opening of those seals we
[50:20] had the perfect interpretation and God
[50:23] come behind him and vindicated it to be
[50:27] the truth right do not discard allottees
[50:37] so I said I'd advise you to read to see
[50:41] whoop start off and go in simplicity cuz
[50:45] if I ever get around to it with on right
[50:47] back through there again because I've
[50:50] never felt led to preach him over again
[50:52] one after the other because i believe
[50:55] when i finished it during 83 did I had
[50:59] brought it to the understanding that was
[51:01] right
[51:03] we're going to go back there and pick up
[51:05] some more times and bring it into view
[51:09] so I would start in the seal book and
[51:13] read and give you something to do for it
[51:17] whenever I get time to preach but you
[51:20] see church in building the body of
[51:25] Christ the body cord the Chrysler mr.
[51:31] God revealed is not perfect without to
[51:33] hate it will just give you that car
[51:36] that's where the Prophet covered in it
[51:38] go to be sensible to look at the body we
[51:42] was up in the store the other day me and
[51:44] Abby was walking around and you know she
[51:47] looked over there and showing them what
[51:49] do they call Americans or what the words
[51:51] are for you know when them statues 10
[51:53] and Eric to put the clothes on you know
[51:55] and she said that no I don't hate me and
[52:02] while we come around 21 and she said
[52:03] they don't allow no ladies you know she
[52:07] was looking around and seeing tons well
[52:10] see it wasn't perfect the head and body
[52:16] has to unite the prophet of God said in
[52:19] the last days to bring the message
[52:22] that's not gonna be something different
[52:25] from what the prophets it it's going to
[52:26] be watching properties already college
[52:30] there's going to be revealed to you and
[52:32] I and then it becomes perfection now
[52:39] listen church please I'm trying to
[52:41] illustrate this get it so you've been in
[52:45] the message 10 years 15 20 years can you
[52:50] ever fit back and think about when you
[52:51] come in this message how much you
[52:53] understood huh
[52:59] the early sat down sometimes and thank
[53:02] God for what he's revealed to die it was
[53:12] just our kid and fussing ice always go
[53:20] home I've heard of the message of 66
[53:23] come on in 67 and all I was doing with
[53:28] our again and fussing about what the
[53:30] Prophet tom well that's what I see still
[53:34] basically going on around the world
[53:37] there's an argument fussing over what
[53:40] the Prophet top now remember when the
[53:48] two sold message came out they really
[53:51] started going with it and I told him on
[53:55] the end I said while alive i was running
[53:59] around the country talking about how
[54:03] many souls you had you know as the lord
[54:08] was revealing to me when it's over it
[54:11] was right that's it my soul is a beating
[54:16] it's a person that's what you are right
[54:18] that's why Jesus can go to hell and
[54:21] freaks to the spirits in prison in being
[54:23] his soul but it was his soul that went
[54:27] ahead but it was the person of Jesus
[54:29] Christ the thank God forever they're
[54:34] less need to be error among you the
[54:36] scripture said that they better approve
[54:38] maybe many men offense when the two
[54:43] Lords begin to strike the view of the
[54:47] people
[54:52] then the Lord began to talk to me about
[54:56] Claire truly was woman and that would
[55:03] bring all the manifestations and not
[55:08] have to to deviate from any of the
[55:10] things the prophetess it amounted to
[55:13] bringing it down to the true
[55:15] understanding now if it's not going on
[55:18] to perfection i want to ask you one
[55:20] question you go back into the hebrew
[55:25] series 1957 run around preached great
[55:31] lifting messages about who melt says
[55:35] that it was he brought it down to being
[55:40] the person of Almighty God right and
[55:45] that Jesus Christ was that person right
[55:49] but when the seals broke he preached who
[55:57] is this melt inside right he was going
[56:02] on to perfection do you understand he
[56:04] was saying who it was back there but
[56:07] then would it become personally said who
[56:08] if this melts hasn't it you agree that
[56:13] he priests one true and living God back
[56:15] in the early ministry and up to 63 and
[56:18] he was preaching 1 through 11 God and
[56:20] never preached anything else but then he
[56:23] preached a message oh Christ is the
[56:27] mystery of God Raviv amen why did you
[56:32] have to preach that when he'd always
[56:34] preach that Christ was Almighty God was
[56:40] he city he saw who Christ is he where
[56:44] Christ was a right see Christ is not
[56:48] Christ was the Messiah Christ is the
[56:51] mystery man male Kennedy who melts
[56:54] azmuth is worried that
[57:01] go into the message that that you see of
[57:04] the prophet and even take the titles and
[57:06] read it sometime I don't need you don't
[57:07] get one of the books that this shows the
[57:09] titles and just read the titles and see
[57:14] if not after the opening of the seals I
[57:16] see they didn't break to the basis of
[57:18] where all went into an eternal message
[57:22] because that's where his macys begun he
[57:29] had to preach back over what piled on
[57:30] him and fries he had to try to bring the
[57:32] fight to the father's yet and he had to
[57:34] preach it for it to be in him and then
[57:39] God revealed to him what he was supposed
[57:40] to preach so he was going on to
[57:44] perfection this way cause it dead works
[57:50] way cause it Carla reform is because
[57:54] people just sat down and like he said we
[57:56] put too much study on the principles now
[58:04] if you've got a new group of people
[58:05] where you going breach principles right
[58:11] right you've got young people coming
[58:15] into the message why are you gonna break
[58:17] to a prince remote so we don't leave the
[58:20] principles but we can't just get down
[58:25] and say well of roots preachy time way I
[58:28] told her brother one time listen the
[58:32] rest said you don't have to tell her
[58:34] bride but one time he said yeah but I
[58:37] keep foods burden straight well I'm
[58:41] sorry I know I'm arrogant hey but I was
[58:45] as honest as I could be now love the
[58:48] brother he's dead and I stone I told him
[58:51] I said what brother if all you go preach
[58:55] to his foolish virgins I said you become
[59:00] a foolish virgin preacher
[59:07] I'm with Mary Goodman hateful just
[59:10] telling the truth if I we preach them
[59:15] like I said the other day of closing
[59:16] higher and stuff that's not even the
[59:19] pretzels that's the things we ought to
[59:22] do without having to be told you mean I
[59:30] gotta tell my wife every day only mmm
[59:33] thank you sure little bit too much no
[59:38] she needs one or two times she needs the
[59:41] gospel spiking early mr. Barrow Theissen
[59:46] one see your hateful no I'm not because
[59:51] she's got a right to look at me and say
[59:52] you're not lining up and she'll tell you
[59:56] that we've had those conversations and
[59:59] she's told me a lot of times I'm not
[1:00:00] lying another you mean you let your wife
[1:00:03] talk to you like that if it's the truth
[1:00:06] yes if they may I just walk out of the
[1:00:09] room if it ain't right i don't my
[1:00:13] daughter you're not talking about me
[1:00:15] when she's right you know what I do I go
[1:00:18] say God forgive me because I want to go
[1:00:23] on I want to go all to perfection the
[1:00:29] greatest perfection that there is would
[1:00:30] be people that will walk off the earth
[1:00:32] in a raster one we don't realize the
[1:00:39] rafters already in us by the new earth
[1:00:42] then we're looking somewhere else and
[1:00:47] we'll never be able to attain it like I
[1:00:52] said the Prophet said when that which is
[1:00:55] perfect is come damage to the parts
[1:00:57] because what he said we have not going
[1:01:01] to we have the perfect interpretation
[1:01:04] with divine vindication
[1:01:07] you know the problem same what he had
[1:01:14] would you understand so you will know
[1:01:19] seals broke to that profit What did he
[1:01:22] say he said the Bible became a new book
[1:01:28] now I don't I know I shouldn't even talk
[1:01:32] because he human again but I'm always
[1:01:35] open my mouth and saying things that
[1:01:37] don't come out good not seeing people be
[1:01:41] in the message too much you barely got
[1:01:44] him to baptism and no I thought they
[1:01:46] ain't got that done you they'll say when
[1:01:51] them seals broke that mob will come
[1:01:54] brand new book I'm sorry
[1:02:05] after all these years of studying it I'm
[1:02:08] beginning to find out this brand new
[1:02:10] boot I hey man there's still a lot that
[1:02:13] I don't understand it they made you
[1:02:17] knowing there by the end I'm trying to
[1:02:19] go on right when I preach the seals in
[1:02:24] 82 and 83 that ditch stands till today
[1:02:30] anybody want to listen to it and see if
[1:02:31] I was wrong what you see I saw that to
[1:02:38] church was not at that place that she
[1:02:43] needed to be you remember the war in
[1:02:49] Kuwait when it started and I walked out
[1:02:55] here that night and I had been told that
[1:02:58] the war and Kuwait had started and the
[1:03:01] people were saying this would be the
[1:03:02] final war that would go on to the war of
[1:03:04] Armageddon you know because it would be
[1:03:10] another world war when I walked out here
[1:03:15] I said courting the way the Lord
[1:03:16] revealed it to me we've got a lot to
[1:03:20] preach it sold our by if you'll pray
[1:03:27] with me will pray and God will bind the
[1:03:30] forces of the enemy that they will not
[1:03:33] be able to use them against our troops
[1:03:38] you remember that now you remember what
[1:03:42] happened we lost more people in friendly
[1:03:45] fire then we did from the enemy
[1:03:54] why because the Lord showed made it
[1:03:58] wouldn't tell me it wasn't finished up
[1:04:02] we had too much to preach you remember
[1:04:10] that but see people don't think about
[1:04:11] that they don't think that somebody
[1:04:14] could stand at your days of like that
[1:04:17] but she says what he told me I just come
[1:04:21] told you like he told me that it wasn't
[1:04:25] over yet because the people went into
[1:04:29] place all I've ever tried to do is get
[1:04:35] you a night to a place that we would
[1:04:37] realize realization of what we are who
[1:04:40] we are what we're doing you you remember
[1:04:49] here while back and this will be very
[1:04:50] important to you later you remember I
[1:04:52] don't know how long do what's being I
[1:04:54] told you this you want to see the bride
[1:04:57] of Jesus Christ look in the Book of
[1:04:58] Revelations the book he was told to stay
[1:05:02] away from because you couldn't
[1:05:03] understand it I told you said if because
[1:05:08] Jesus has never shown in the Book of
[1:05:11] Revelations by himself he's always there
[1:05:15] with the bride
[1:05:22] so that's going on to perfection the
[1:05:26] said Polly when he finishes up Hebrew
[1:05:28] said when he says let us go on unto
[1:05:31] perfection he said we will if God permit
[1:05:37] what was the next thing he done he went
[1:05:39] right up into a spiritual revelation and
[1:05:41] said it's impossible for those who were
[1:05:47] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:05:50] heavenly gift and we're made for takers
[1:05:53] of the Holy Ghost to fall away see now
[1:06:01] what's what we do we make it carnal
[1:06:03] reform we make it dead works because we
[1:06:07] read that as I say well ago we read that
[1:06:10] as saying if you ever tasted this
[1:06:13] message and you walk away from that
[1:06:15] you're off
[1:06:22] you took the Word of God maybe the dead
[1:06:24] works the prophet of God said that Paul
[1:06:29] was explaining that it is impossible for
[1:06:32] you to have the new birth and follow
[1:06:35] away he had jumped up from being dead
[1:06:38] works now he's talking about heavenly
[1:06:40] principles he went out to perfection in
[1:06:46] that very versus then it's impossible
[1:06:51] your prophet of God said we talk about
[1:06:53] perfection i gave them do you write as
[1:06:55] if you talk about perfection he said
[1:06:57] only way to be perfect that's in Jesus
[1:06:59] crying man we see the new birth is not
[1:07:04] to completion of the individual right
[1:07:06] the new birth is only the baby form of
[1:07:09] the beginning and the principles right
[1:07:12] the growth development of the statue of
[1:07:14] a perfect man is going on to perfection
[1:07:19] the going home to a rafter a change is
[1:07:23] going on to perfection going on to the
[1:07:26] opening of the seals the preaching the
[1:07:27] great revelation the prophetess brow is
[1:07:30] going on to perfection let's see where's
[1:07:36] the preachers that want to preach on
[1:07:40] they hold the people spellbound by
[1:07:43] telling them how good they are not
[1:07:47] perfect you are but now let's go on
[1:07:55] let's get off and you know what your
[1:07:57] profit talking about sugar tits the old
[1:08:03] dayz some of the old one here know what
[1:08:05] the sugar tits would you put things in
[1:08:09] there and put sugar around it for some
[1:08:11] little bay for the baby to suck them
[1:08:13] when you needed you got the croup you
[1:08:16] know what you end up getting kerosene
[1:08:21] with sugar pudding put in your mouth or
[1:08:27] look at it down the throat it went you
[1:08:31] just watch out every bit of that slime
[1:08:33] and garbage it was enough you sugar tits
[1:08:41] you know we go off on people my mother
[1:08:48] used to tell me how they've done it I've
[1:08:49] told you this before you probably don't
[1:08:51] even believe it there on Sunday night
[1:08:54] they take an onion and put it in bake it
[1:08:56] and then get that grease out of that
[1:08:58] onion they bake it and they catch the
[1:09:01] grease out of the onion and they put it
[1:09:05] in the baby's milk to drink that night
[1:09:11] to where the baby would sleep to
[1:09:13] lunchtime on Monday where they could do
[1:09:16] the wash they give you a flat dose of
[1:09:21] opium holy my mama didn't do that nuts
[1:09:27] forget it forget it don't talk to me
[1:09:32] about junk maintain silence but then all
[1:09:41] we're in the day of a dope in winter how
[1:09:43] degree attach the way they got to work
[1:09:46] done listen church it's time to go on to
[1:09:52] perfection Lula George you I'm not
[1:09:55] talking two words out so you might have
[1:09:56] listen that's their business I'm talking
[1:09:58] to Lula Georgia after all that we've
[1:10:01] done
[1:10:02] scene and God is revealing to us and the
[1:10:04] signs and wonders has took place among
[1:10:06] us let us go to perfection let's don't
[1:10:14] settle down and stop told you this is
[1:10:19] this message that I'm on now is not
[1:10:21] backing up you think it is I've told you
[1:10:25] and pleaded with you don't think that
[1:10:27] pray with me that God reveal to you what
[1:10:30] brother Dale is trying to bring what I
[1:10:32] hide in Italian we got along to
[1:10:37] perfection in this century it's not to
[1:10:39] be revealed to us right but if we don't
[1:10:47] have a foundation how can it be revealed
[1:10:50] right I do believe at least we have the
[1:10:55] foundation brother Dale look at the
[1:11:00] great things that you preach the great
[1:11:02] position rather let's go to perfection
[1:11:05] could I not stop and sell them man i'm
[1:11:12] crying daily god what can i bring to get
[1:11:17] the people to see I've done at her
[1:11:19] sister see them grow in 83 to try to get
[1:11:26] the people to say what God is saying we
[1:11:29] are right but he's made us
[1:11:37] you don't want your children to stay
[1:11:39] little babies three they went born into
[1:11:44] Earth that purpose it was more than the
[1:11:47] world grew up you don't want him to stay
[1:11:52] little you want him to grown into
[1:11:55] perfection adulthood so this going on
[1:12:01] his children laying aside all the
[1:12:06] principles and the doctrines and I think
[1:12:08] take what we have and stand on it as a
[1:12:11] foundation and all it did God had
[1:12:13] revealed EU hi I'm say let's go to
[1:12:16] perfection he said with brother Dale
[1:12:22] Luke were these other people I don't
[1:12:24] even know nothing about this that man
[1:12:26] ain't got nothing to do with you and
[1:12:27] Nate right God has graciously opened his
[1:12:32] word to reveal himself to you and I
[1:12:35] because we try to make ourselves
[1:12:37] available to that position they cry out
[1:12:39] for that let's go home let's go into
[1:12:47] perfection somebody's going to reach
[1:12:50] your body change amen you know what you
[1:12:55] know that won't be the completion of it
[1:12:57] right car according to my understanding
[1:13:01] we get a body change here then we go
[1:13:03] meet him in the iron see there's more
[1:13:05] going on to perfect I going to my
[1:13:09] understanding I hope it's you heard that
[1:13:14] when we leave this world that will get a
[1:13:17] message of cheer down through the
[1:13:19] endless ages by the Lord Jesus himself
[1:13:21] what going on to perfection right you
[1:13:29] think what you see the day it's perfect
[1:13:31] way to the mall room pray pray we're

[1:14:23] didn't you become but you know what
[1:14:28] that'll be I'm only far those who've
[1:14:30] gone on to perfection now listen you
[1:14:39] take the old Indian he started up to it
[1:14:43] and we saw him doing it we took up the
[1:14:45] habit you know what we do we taken extra
[1:14:49] tree we'd hotter it out you know we

[1:15:00] wrestler yeah we made a barge that we
[1:15:05] could float across the river and do
[1:15:08] great thing but how would you like to go

[1:16:11] I'll turn the air conditioner on the
[1:16:13] heater on and I'm comfortable and I ride
[1:16:15] real good lead-in that's just the 2003
[1:16:19] model alone what these brand new things
[1:16:21] are let's see what if man would have
[1:16:26] done that who was it in the comic strip
[1:16:29] October that that is nice that invented
[1:16:31] the wheel invited the kid is a comic
[1:16:34] strip kids you know bc then he finally
[1:16:37] invented the wheel well this the other
[1:16:40] day they put it out one where he's in
[1:16:41] admitted the car no but you see it did
[1:16:50] start from somebody but you know that
[1:16:53] wheel at the wheels life America needed
[1:16:56] inventor wit with that wheel that idea
[1:16:59] that somebody had you try to take them
[1:17:02] off of a car and run down the road with
[1:17:04] without them right so don't leave the
[1:17:10] principles let him hold us up and go
[1:17:14] with the message of the hour going until
[1:17:19] we've come to a place of perfection
[1:17:22] you'll all be in Christ and he is the
[1:17:27] word so let's go on in the word comb
[1:17:32] British stand together let's go on in
[1:17:35] the word let's take what we've got today
[1:17:39] but not look at it like tomorrow
[1:17:42] sufficient no there will be more
[1:17:44] revealed tomorrow give us this day our
[1:17:46] daily bread traveling on
[1:17:55] going on what we got today it's a
[1:18:00] wonderful thing but tomorrow comes more
[1:18:05] be required they took the horsepower
[1:18:08] that pulled the little buggy you know
[1:18:12] they have any the cars you know what
[1:18:15] they call that under the hood I'll let
[1:18:17] metal and junk it pushing you down the
[1:18:19] road they call that horsepower well then
[1:18:23] one day some guys decided and they made
[1:18:25] it our plane you know and they may took
[1:18:27] the horsepower and they flew with a hard
[1:18:29] one then the nvidia great are flames and
[1:18:33] you know what's called horsepower but
[1:18:37] it's going on to perfection one day that
[1:18:40] same horsepower lifted men of the earth
[1:18:42] the interplanetary travel that your
[1:18:44] prophet of God said that would be a type
[1:18:46] of the right shirt would be
[1:18:50] interplanetary travel so they had to
[1:18:52] have a natural interplanetary travel had
[1:18:56] to happen in our last days but let's go
[1:18:59] on to perfection because one day they
[1:19:03] set one up and they didn't have it
[1:19:04] exactly right you know what that could
[1:19:07] blow it up what you see we keep going on
[1:19:12] to perfection things keep getting
[1:19:14] greater and greater the old days when
[1:19:20] you got sick you go to the doctor you
[1:19:25] know what you're done hey Paul you think
[1:19:28] your nails out and things and bleeds you
[1:19:30] a good pint of blood that's medical
[1:19:34] doctor medical sonic they bleed you good
[1:19:37] pipeline because the recreational in the
[1:19:39] blood cells by the body would
[1:19:40] automatically cause a process of healing
[1:19:43] to be in the body so they were doing
[1:19:46] okay but now who wants to go down today
[1:19:49] and you your city can you go down today
