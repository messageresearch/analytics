[0:00] for next Sunday all right let's go and
[0:04] go back to where we were last Sunday to
[0:06] DQ oh just for a moment and we'll move
[0:11] on with this I hope knit though you
[0:14] weren't here last Sunday you need to
[0:16] listen to that portion that we did right
[0:21] so we have a good background that was to
[0:23] me that was real vital for understanding
[0:27] who the son of man he is not was is okay
[0:33] all right so we're going to go to
[0:36] Ezekiel to where Nikki oh 2 verse 1 says
[0:44] and said unto me son of man so there's
[0:47] the capital S stand up on that beach
[0:50] sure he's talking to Ezekiel but once
[0:51] he's going to be he's going to speak
[0:53] under these over to the twos come
[0:54] together then in verse 2 then 2 / 6 it
[0:58] says and thou son of man being on a
[1:00] friend so he's talking some directed
[1:02] them to Ezekiel all right first time
[1:06] he's speaking through his heat you ly
[1:08] son the son of man all right now we know
[1:10] the text prefigure because Jesus was the
[1:12] son of man he was not in a flash body
[1:15] yet though but it was white the Old
[1:17] Testaments given for what hides and
[1:20] shadows right that's what the old Tessa
[1:23] was given for there was a the whole Old
[1:25] Testament is like Modell's it's a
[1:27] parable the whole Old Testament is the
[1:30] total lives of people who are going to
[1:32] read in a minute about the sort of the
[1:34] seed that's a parable but it is a living
[1:37] thing I mean they live ezekiel went
[1:39] through that Old Testament but he wasn't
[1:42] beast on a man he really wasn't a son of
[1:45] man in the extent he had Holy Ghost
[1:47] installed right but God was prophesied
[1:52] to him and through him you got that to
[1:56] him and through him showing to me if you
[2:00] take the Book of Ezekiel he goes all the
[2:01] way remember when zekiel 42 44
[2:04] millennium temple so Ezekiel takes takes
[2:07] you all the way from from the Son of Man
[2:10] revelation they're talking about when we
[2:11] raided last Sunday talking about one did
[2:14] upon the lightness of the throne was the
[2:17] likeness is the appearance of a man
[2:18] above it and verse 26 alright still we
[2:22] see that he speaks all that about the
[2:26] son of man he's talking about a man now
[2:28] remember we took the four beasts last
[2:31] week we took the form is no weapon
[2:32] disease will say the 4 p's had the
[2:34] lightness of land alright so it's for
[2:37] combat beef working through a man
[2:40] alright but it was not the for combat
[2:43] beats working through Ezekiel in the
[2:45] sense that Ezekiel had an indwelling of
[2:48] the Holy Ghost and then those for combat
[2:51] beasts were helping him know he was he
[2:55] was an Old Testament prophet but he
[2:57] wasn't a born-again believer so but when
[2:59] he done though was he yielded itself so
[3:01] much to God that God could use it right
[3:04] alright so we don't we don't belittle a
[3:07] zekiel I don't I don't want anybody to
[3:09] thank even when I think the problem the
[3:13] problem from Bethlehem is tail the
[3:16] problem with the problem with a lot of
[3:24] people when you look at it people in the
[3:28] message they they sell well they gotta
[3:33] have the Holy Ghost they're so powerful
[3:34] a group of people in the Old Testament
[3:36] that's one you know brother told me
[3:38] Abraham had to be a born-again I said
[3:41] show me in the Bible and I even took him
[3:45] to over there like and the New Testament
[3:47] where they called him a friend of God
[3:49] not even child of God Abraham with a
[3:51] friend of God God couldn't get inside
[3:54] that man alright because what happened
[3:59] was it all that was bound up after Adam
[4:02] sinned all that was bound up in what
[4:06] Sonny God all the revelation of the Son
[4:09] of Man and even in son of David was
[4:12] taken away from adam meister
[4:13] about that this morning Adam Adam lost
[4:16] like what we're talking about today
[4:18] talking about stairs Adam lost the
[4:20] ability to bring any of this to pass
[4:23] after he failed all right now he was a
[4:27] sunny guy remember the Bible you go over
[4:30] in Luke Luke calls him a son of God so
[4:33] that's what you don't want with Sonny
[4:34] gun because God was dwelling in Seoul
[4:37] the only man in the Old Testament but
[4:40] now he's easy when Abraham and all those
[4:41] people built the foundation built on the
[4:45] foundation of the apostles and prophets
[4:47] so we can't do away with the foundation
[4:49] we can't make the foundation not of God
[4:53] and then the building of God that the
[4:57] foundation was of God Ezekiel Isaiah
[5:00] Jeremiah all those great prophets but
[5:02] they were all speaking of what they were
[5:04] all prophesizing him something to come
[5:06] number one on my side number two you and
[5:08] I all right because full restoration
[5:12] thank you they weren't restored they
[5:14] really had more revelation of people in
[5:15] the message they know they need
[5:18] restoration they knew they cried out
[5:20] David cried out my soul thirsteth after
[5:24] they all those things you know that
[5:28] David did in the flesh he was so close
[5:32] to God till he knew he shouldn't be
[5:34] doing that right he knew he shouldn't be
[5:37] done but yet he did it anyway because
[5:38] the flesh took over and the Son of God
[5:41] was not dwelling in his soul to do what
[5:45] take that desire way think everything
[5:46] out you know but they what they are
[5:49] considered in the part of redemption is
[5:54] being prophets bringing us to that
[5:56] that's why Ezekiel got on there
[6:01] that's correct that's right that's just
[6:04] like God I see God will honor a
[6:06] prosecutor a God will honor anybody's
[6:09] faith all right anybody it's like
[6:14] brother Dale saying what about Abraham
[6:15] what about a man it just was sitting in
[6:17] his house all comfy and cozy selling
[6:20] aisles and had all this family around
[6:23] him and he thought man this is good and
[6:25] one day he just hears a voice that says
[6:29] Abram get up get your family and move
[6:39] where am I going I just get ugly get
[6:43] only you don't need to be here get up
[6:46] and leave what great faith is that right
[6:49] right that's the one with Ezekiel I
[6:52] believe when his ego saw all these
[6:54] visions listen it's just like me and you
[6:57] things don't leave you my brother
[7:00] branham things didn't leave him when you
[7:02] have a vision things but those things
[7:04] but he said it still bothers means there
[7:06] are times when you have these needs two
[7:07] things still buy one human being Ezekiel
[7:11] Ezekiel in his writings was showing that
[7:14] there's a son of man going to show up on
[7:16] this earth and actually is the fuel if
[7:18] you'll read through all those eco tells
[7:20] how happened that's going to happen
[7:21] because watching chapter 3 we've covered
[7:24] it last week so I'm am eat that now find
[7:30] its eat this role now remember their
[7:33] workbooks back then there were scrolls
[7:36] or rolls there was no such thing as a
[7:38] book Kathy when the book it was a role
[7:41] that piece of paper so even as he kill
[7:43] he's not saying eat this book but yet he
[7:46] is sandy this book just like John now
[7:48] when you come down to John his comp they
[7:50] begin to start putting things in the
[7:51] book all right eat this role and go
[7:55] speaking to where the house of Israel so
[7:58] all over my mouth it caused me to eat
[8:00] that role now remember I told you last
[8:01] week he cost me to eat the role who the
[8:05] angel or whoever he's talking to you you
[8:07] say the angel the Lord and God or
[8:09] whatever you want to say Jovah angel
[8:11] done
[8:12] he caused me to eat the rope now John
[8:15] being born again Christian that desire
[8:18] in his heart said give me the book or
[8:20] giving me the rope in other words you
[8:23] got it you got to have something to do
[8:24] you gotta have something you don't have
[8:26] something to do with you gotta go get it
[8:27] all right that's what brother Dale's
[8:30] cover and I hope he covers more and more
[8:32] about the unconditional covenant I'm
[8:36] sure Genesis 126 man there was never
[8:39] Covenant made with that man when God put
[8:48] the 126 man into the 27 man he made a
[8:51] covenant lat they let go do's and don'ts
[8:54] in that Genesis 126 man you do this
[8:58] don't do that no when he put out of in
[9:00] flesh he took at him and made him a
[9:02] person then he put that 1.6 man in God
[9:06] wasn't talking to the 126 man when he
[9:08] said do this and don't do that hope he
[9:13] goes through how was that because that
[9:15] he was talking to Adam this human part
[9:20] of Adam because remember the 1.6 man you
[9:23] gotta understand this that never failed
[9:25] it never will fall never had if it has
[9:28] one speck of any fall or sin to it see
[9:32] so there's no unconditional coming
[9:33] that's why I may be covering something
[9:36] for him but that's why bow and I want
[9:38] you to think about so when you go
[9:39] upstairs you're painting up wander off
[9:40] somewhere that's why the unconditional
[9:43] covenant is not eternal when we go back
[9:48] to the 126 man we only each other right
[9:52] hello when we go back to that 122nd a
[9:55] way to come right we need to cover them
[9:59] when we come through the filter of the
[10:00] fog we were here and we come down into
[10:03] followed man that's when you need a
[10:05] covenant color covenant is between what
[10:07] two people right you and God
[10:13] do this don't do that then the
[10:15] unconditional covenant he's talking of
[10:17] the children of God there's a children
[10:19] of God Genesis 1 Quincy all right so
[10:22] jess is 126 made never felt when I talk
[10:24] about Genesis 126 man even when we come
[10:27] down and talking about Ezekiel Ezekiel
[10:30] was a part of that Genesis 1 26 min no
[10:34] no he's he's considered in Redemption he
[10:40] got he was saved by his faith but he's
[10:44] not a child of God he's not a son and
[10:47] daughter of god Adam was because he had
[10:50] he curl up in his soul I don't think
[10:51] some of us are getting that but maybe as
[10:53] we keep going on off your eyes now we
[10:56] can get it well Jesus had to 126 man
[10:59] inside of it remember he gave part of it
[11:02] Diana then he said Adam in other words
[11:05] he give out of that role brother
[11:10] Reynolds said Adam Eve was supposed to
[11:12] produce the body for Jesus whatever hell
[11:14] they was supposed to come we were just
[11:15] supposed to come that role is what that
[11:18] role is this with your name in it right
[11:26] so I open my mouth and he calls me to
[11:29] eat that role and he said unto me son of
[11:31] man cause I belly to eat and fill thy
[11:35] bowels with this role that I give me
[11:37] then did I eat it and it was in my mouth
[11:40] as honey for sweetness now watch John
[11:43] goes further and says but what but in my
[11:47] belly it's bitter one you gotta live it
[11:50] now Ezekiel sure is if you lived it but
[11:54] there was flaws that they'd like David
[11:57] David could have come to a place but
[11:59] when he comes before he freezes right
[12:01] here eat it in my mouth honey for
[12:03] sweetness it's tough but now in
[12:06] Revelations where you got John there
[12:08] what you've got redemption Jesus was
[12:12] already on the scene and going again
[12:14] John when John had to eat the book all
[12:17] right all right just like the bride John
[12:20] cop surprise so the bride's gotta eat
[12:22] the book and all it's great when we're
[12:24] sitting here under the anointing of the
[12:26] honey that's right but when we got to go
[12:28] out there and live it that's the
[12:30] bitterness that's the bitterness to the
[12:32] belly and when we got to go out there
[12:33] and live it not saying is he killed
[12:35] didn't go out then women but he didn't
[12:37] have to live it like we live because he
[12:39] wasn't required to live it like we're
[12:42] required to living is it could be that
[12:46] when you have laws like the Old
[12:49] Testament people had musicians they
[12:52] didn't have to really think that's
[12:54] correct exactly right kid but now when
[12:56] you have the Holy Spirit in you like
[12:59] Johnson we gotta remember that's the
[13:03] judge that's right that's the judge yeah
[13:10] cuz sometimes brother Dale even has to
[13:12] say things he don't even want to say
[13:13] brother branham had the same things he
[13:14] really didn't want to say why that's the
[13:17] bitterness part that's the judge part
[13:19] memories a judge now right he's a judge
[13:22] all right and who the what the Saints
[13:25] will judge Europe so that's the judge
[13:28] inside of it there's a lot of things I
[13:30] believe Jesus in his humanity didn't
[13:32] want to do he didn't want to call them
[13:34] people that follow the devil I don't
[13:37] think he I don't think he hesitated to
[13:39] say it but I in his humanity sure people
[13:42] listened he had to live there's a lot of
[13:44] gaps in this Bible he'll live a long
[13:46] time than he thought a lot right right
[13:51] he went just like like Lewis anyone God
[13:54] zombie yeah he didn't get up and go I
[13:56] have no fog but this and you know no he
[14:01] said I only do what the father tells me
[14:02] to do well the father didn't have time
[14:04] to get up in the morn his body need his
[14:07] father d how tell him to eat e right but
[14:11] when you come down to what he had to
[14:12] fulfil as the son of man I won't talk
[14:14] about son of male was a flesh God God in
[14:19] human flesh amen so God in human flesh
[14:22] there were limitations
[14:26] right right Jesus didn't just go sit on
[14:29] the moon in his flesh no but the son of
[14:32] god Ken right it's on the son of man was
[14:37] the part that kept the Son of God same
[14:39] way with me and you why can't we go to
[14:41] the wall now if we fell over dead today
[14:44] we walked through that wall right ok
[14:48] don't want you to start thinking about
[14:49] some of these things we're not finna put
[14:51] son of David up here to the tree and
[14:52] start thinking about but we still got a
[14:54] lot to do with this son of man alright
[14:56] so let's go there may understand now in
[14:59] Ezekiel what's going on he's prophesying
[15:01] but what's happening if you see that big
[15:04] that capital you know one thing's for
[15:06] sure that's God talking to Israel
[15:09] through a Mac through a little song1
[15:14] around since I am a son of man revealing
[15:17] the Son of Man right hey man when
[15:22] brother Brandon was living his human
[15:24] life he was the son of man Louis but
[15:27] when he was preaching the Word of God
[15:29] and he said thus said the Lord or he was
[15:31] preaching the great doctrines of
[15:32] marriage and divorce and any simulation
[15:34] that was the son of man I was thinking
[15:37] last night something came up last night
[15:40] about about 9 of 70 weeks after I went
[15:43] to bed so I spent another hour preaching
[15:47] to myself before I went to sleep jim was
[15:49] just rocking me to sleep that's the
[15:54] third guy I listen up I'm not belittling
[15:57] her remember quite brother branham say
[15:59] brother round said I'd wait media and
[16:01] start preaching to us as you fall asleep
[16:03] don't come in yet it happens with
[16:06] profits what listen about the prophets
[16:08] wife if it probably won't me up I'd be
[16:09] going
[16:12] but no listen when God Almighty took
[16:16] three men upon a mountain they were
[16:17] asleep when Almighty God took three men
[16:19] into a garden they fell asleep when
[16:23] Jesus appeared to him in human flesh
[16:24] glorified walked through the wall
[16:26] appeared to him Peter went fishing so if
[16:32] it's not revealed to you anyway Ford you
[16:34] know I'm just I'm just making fun but
[16:36] she was she was sleeping and I was
[16:38] preaching because somebody had brought
[16:39] something about that in 70 weeks come up
[16:41] to my mind and I thought well that had
[16:44] to come through the Son of Man ministry
[16:47] because what happens is the Son of Man
[16:51] ministry has to go to Israel they
[16:55] rejected the Son of Man the flesh park
[17:01] that walked on earth to take a seat but
[17:05] God said I'll never forget Israel so
[17:06] that same man though cannot come back to
[17:11] earth until Israel it's brought back a
[17:15] man because you know what we fulfill the
[17:19] part when we take a body change it is
[17:21] the son of man standing on earth in
[17:22] human flesh and many member body but
[17:25] it's not the son of man standing on
[17:26] human flesh himself right so if we don't
[17:30] get Daniel seventy weeks and these great
[17:32] dolphins correct that son of man you're
[17:35] not going to take a body chain Jesus
[17:39] didn't have a problem when he was on
[17:41] earth it's like brother Ron I really
[17:43] enjoyed that the other night really
[17:46] enjoyed it basically when he come to the
[17:47] park Bree said we're trading as your
[17:50] accuser right saying the fuses everybody
[17:53] right but when Jesus walked up into the
[17:56] home of pilot Ron said if there was one
[18:03] fault against that man of the devil
[18:05] would have found it he said he even had
[18:09] to have a sinner a Gentile say I find no
[18:15] fault in him so there stood a faultless
[18:19] human mortal man with God inside of him
[18:22] that's what we
[18:24] I find no fault in this person right
[18:27] here in other words I find that I was
[18:30] saying in my heart I find no false
[18:32] doctrine in this person because what was
[18:35] Jesus Jesus was his daughter right he
[18:39] was his doctrine may benefit so when he
[18:42] went before Pilate he hey listen the
[18:45] Pharisees and Sadducees was standing
[18:46] there too it wasn't just pilot right
[18:50] they were all standing there that's what
[18:52] r on him really it was a good point he
[18:54] said the devil's going to find one thing
[18:57] he's gone about people going out and
[18:58] doing things you know he said the
[18:59] devil's going to accuse you he said he
[19:02] brought Jesus right down to the Jews
[19:04] were there the Gentiles were there he
[19:06] said basically everybody that was in the
[19:09] world what was like represented in that
[19:14] Hall and he said the devil was
[19:16] everything and do you think if the devil
[19:19] could find fault winning somebody would
[19:21] have said I got this right here and he
[19:24] would have brought it out and he said I
[19:26] find no fault with it that was the son
[19:28] of man that we got to see so in other
[19:30] words you can't find false doctrine in
[19:32] the Sun man you tell me one place that's
[19:34] been talked often in the son of man
[19:35] that's why the Son of Man ministry had
[19:37] been here now you take the Son of God it
[19:41] has no fault but you put him in a flash
[19:43] man he can have its own ideas right
[19:48] right sons of God have died because of
[19:51] their doctrine Luke and died because of
[19:53] his doctrine Son of God doctrine is not
[19:55] three gods or Trinity but when that son
[19:58] of God when in blücher the devil through
[20:03] the filter Tony with Trinity right
[20:07] that's Wayne's in the grave that's why
[20:11] all these people are in the grave that's
[20:12] wandering the grave right because they
[20:15] don't have their doctrine our fault
[20:18] we're so i can say i find no fault in
[20:21] you alright so that's to me i thought
[20:24] that was really good
[20:25] point of a brought out at a devil will
[20:27] don't you think he miss an opportunity
[20:28] to bring the fall town especially
[20:31] knowing that that was man with different
[20:33] than the rest of them if he could have
[20:34] found one thing well hey like jesus
[20:37] jesus walks up you know that goes the
[20:39] woman down in adultery when you tell it
[20:44] woman where's your cancer Jesus didn't
[20:48] see it so he said I find no fault in you
[20:51] i cants I didn't see you do that now
[20:53] Jesus would literally say they're coming
[20:54] to dr. hida headstone now that's me and
[20:58] you we know we did it she knew she knew
[21:02] she committed adultery Jesus didn't ask
[21:05] her did you commit adultery he knew
[21:08] she'd committed adultery by the way they
[21:09] by the way she was right he knows me and
[21:13] you got caught and what's in in this
[21:16] body in this place we got caught but hey
[21:20] in the mouth of two or three witnesses
[21:22] let everything this time with jesus said
[21:25] if i can get rid of their accusers I
[21:26] didn't see her do it I didn't see her do
[21:32] it I didn't see you do it because this
[21:35] man they were done right okay but now it
[21:39] comes down to where these two come
[21:40] together so close where you find no
[21:42] fault in this man they weren't talking
[21:44] about finding fault in this man and was
[21:47] no fault in this man room but when you
[21:48] put him in here look at all the things
[21:50] he went through line for three and a
[21:51] half years especially where the focus of
[21:53] the ministry was on Jesus we find no
[21:57] fault with it so we go for subject cool
[22:00] ability that's okay let's turn to
[22:01] Matthew just for a minute and
[22:07] let's read the parable of the sower of
[22:11] the seed Matthew 13 because this is
[22:14] where he brings right in of what's going
[22:15] on the same day when she is out of the
[22:17] house step outside great most people
[22:19] gathered together unto him so that you
[22:21] went into those ships at the whole month
[22:22] to stone shore he's paid many things of
[22:24] them in parables saying behold a sower
[22:27] went forth to so now we all know that
[22:29] parable correct but now what happens is
[22:33] verse 10 disciples came unto him said
[22:36] unto him without the Holy Ghost they
[22:38] were what they were reading the clothes
[22:42] long time without the Holy Ghost they
[22:45] were reading the quote all right they
[22:51] went getting the essence when I saw them
[22:53] to them last night at the table you can
[22:55] take lavender and you can take
[22:56] peppermint and spearmint and all those
[22:58] and they're asleep they're just liquid
[23:01] how do you tell their different by their
[23:05] essence of their odor that you smell you
[23:08] say that's peppermint why that's what it
[23:12] gives forth but if you look at it if you
[23:15] pour it in all those cups if you pour
[23:17] lavender and spearmint all these and
[23:18] these different cuff it's all the same
[23:20] color liquid is liquid but the essence
[23:24] in other words they might have heard
[23:26] that a story like this why speak two
[23:28] thousand to them in parallel and the
[23:30] answer them because it is given this you
[23:32] to know the mysteries of the kingdom but
[23:34] to them it's not given what was he doing
[23:36] Jesus was saying in other words one day
[23:38] you're really going to understand what
[23:39] I'm doing all right but not to them yuva
[23:42] no words what he said you got to tell
[23:43] them he is given unto you what here's
[23:48] the sample so what if there's a samples
[23:50] do they took it and give it to them you
[23:55] got that it's the man what they were
[23:57] minister watch you ever have to him
[24:00] shall be given and he shall have more
[24:02] abundance but they never have not from
[24:04] him she'll be taken away even that he
[24:06] had therefore speak unto them in
[24:08] parables because they see see not
[24:10] hearing they hear not neither do they
[24:13] understand and Dennis fulfill the
[24:16] prophet Isaiah which says by hearing he
[24:18] show here and she'll know
[24:20] understanding seeing you justin's you'll
[24:22] not proceed remember seeing is what it's
[24:25] all I got to do with understanding
[24:26] alright so let's go look many prophets
[24:31] and righteous men have desired to see
[24:33] those things with GC and have not seen
[24:35] them and to hear those things with G
[24:37] here and have not heard them here you
[24:39] therefore the parable of the sower what
[24:42] a wonderful guy I what a wonderful God
[24:46] that can tell us these things he keeps
[24:49] telling them he's telling them right
[24:54] here in 24 I do that but what you doing
[24:59] he keep talking but nobody say he
[25:01] explains to him in verse 37 but skip
[25:04] down the letters for a few minutes he
[25:06] answered and said unto them he that so
[25:08] it's a good seed is who'd son of man
[25:12] gone listen God in spirit form is the
[25:21] seed listen to minute God in spirit form
[25:26] is to see right Nazis as a mini
[25:29] Galatians 3 16 but what thy seed which
[25:34] is Christ are so there's one seed but
[25:36] the salt good sea the sower even so what
[25:39] the good seed is the son of man the Son
[25:43] of God for for what four thousand years
[25:47] before Jesus came on earth sure he was
[25:51] sowing seed but remember he went sowing
[25:55] seed in the heart of ya through the
[25:56] prophets but he went sowing seed in the
[25:58] heart of man there was no new birth and
[26:02] in Old Testament okay web so in seated
[26:04] in the heart of men all right he was
[26:06] sowing seed in the ground that's what a
[26:09] crop to come up remember you don't sow
[26:12] seed then God and say well I'll harvest
[26:14] my for tomorrow no it's got to come up
[26:17] come up two stages mature but he is
[26:20] talking good see he is telling you
[26:21] exactly do they say
[26:22] it's decent man not a son of man d son
[26:26] ma'am capital ass so who was you talking
[26:30] about miss out you stole my self all
[26:34] right he was talking about him standing
[26:36] on the earth the field is the world the
[26:39] good seed are the children of the
[26:40] kingdom whose children of the kingdom
[26:42] the new burrow is what the kingdom all
[26:46] right the new verb is the kingdom now
[26:48] the children of the kingdom must be the
[26:50] people that receiving you murdered that
[26:52] kind of one plus one equals two all
[26:54] right so they did see the good seed is
[26:58] if you look to your Villa kingdom that's
[27:00] one of us let me stop this man that's
[27:01] why let's talk about last night in
[27:03] Daniel seventy weeks everybody's look
[27:05] looking at all these quotes and all
[27:06] these things are you gonna do is go to
[27:08] Bible are you doing on the model Daniel
[27:12] 924 explains every bit of it without I
[27:14] make sure we had to have a property to
[27:16] bring it to us but once the probably
[27:17] brought it to us it's not brother random
[27:19] revelation that I got the revelation now
[27:21] I got a revelation same revelation of
[27:24] property god man the Bible says that
[27:26] there's three periods seven-week the 62
[27:29] week in one week and when you get to
[27:32] this one in the scripture says he shall
[27:34] make a covenant with many for one week a
[27:36] lot of people say that's God god don't
[27:40] break covenants if you'll keep reading
[27:41] it says he breaks the Covenant so that
[27:44] he is who Antichrist now listen the
[27:48] prophet of God told us we're not here
[27:50] when the Antichrist makes that coming up
[27:52] with the Jews so the rapture has to take
[27:55] place before that one week begins simple
[28:00] as it can be you can't argue with that
[28:02] kind of dense a days a week left it says
[28:05] they would one full week or seven years
[28:07] well after the rapture of the church
[28:09] there seven years so I mean I mean it's
[28:11] just simple me it is actually more
[28:14] simple you can't complicate it with what
[28:17] quotes but the essence of the quote is
[28:20] what you go look in the field is the
[28:21] world against each other the kingdom
[28:23] tears are the children of the wicked one
[28:25] now watch though both come up right both
[28:28] are coming up the tears are coming up to
[28:31] alright the field is the world
[28:33] the enemy that sowed them is the devil
[28:35] so there's two people on the same the
[28:37] Son of Man and the devil all right the
[28:41] enemy of some of mrs. devil the harvest
[28:42] at the end of the world and the Reapers
[28:44] of the Angels as there for the tares are
[28:46] gathered and burned in the fire so shall
[28:49] it be in the end of this world the Son
[28:52] of man shall send forth his angels now
[28:57] watch those angels what's what they do
[29:04] they show gather out of his kingdom all
[29:07] things that offend and then let's do
[29:09] iniquity he said all those are those are
[29:11] bad angels no remember brother Brian
[29:17] saying God sends a messenger what does
[29:19] the messenger do three things he comes
[29:22] on San brings his message condemns the
[29:24] people for falling away from the
[29:26] previous message and what condemns the
[29:28] world brings judgment all right every
[29:31] time I probably hits the earth he's
[29:32] bringing judgment but he can also bring
[29:34] in the oh so that's what to me that's
[29:36] that's the seven churches his angels and
[29:39] they shall gather out of his kingdom all
[29:41] that offend then was doing it me and
[29:43] she'll cast him in the furnace upon what
[29:45] not literally pick him up throw them out
[29:46] but his word is dividing his word is
[29:50] dividing the weed in the tariff all
[29:52] right and she'll cast into furniture
[29:54] father's should be waiting a gnashing
[29:56] teeth then shall the righteous shine
[29:57] forth there's the Sun in the kingdom of
[29:59] their father so they got a day so they
[30:03] must be children who had ears to hear
[30:05] let him hear then you come back to
[30:07] treasure get in the field but the store
[30:10] the seeds are sown man why why this is
[30:14] our tempo think about this for next
[30:17] Sunday this is not our kinsman in this
[30:20] form this is your hope of God the judge
[30:24] one of us right father this is our
[30:30] kinsman a man this is our kinsman
[30:33] redeemer sure is this man in this man
[30:36] but he had to come some land to redeem
[30:38] the earth what was he so in the sea
[30:43] scott nomar's you showed it in the earth
[30:47] hey man he had to come to this earth and
[30:50] what is the sowing of the seed the
[30:52] preaching of the gospel hey man this is
[30:55] the only seed there is right all right
[30:58] right but there's many seeds inside this
[31:01] eve hey man 1 c 2 apple plant in the
[31:05] ground and when he comes up these
[31:06] thousands and thousands of apples gonna
[31:09] be produced you don't want brother brown

[31:30] thing right here we're we're right here
[31:35] Joe gather out of his kingdom so they
[31:38] got to be down here preaching on the
[31:41] earth and what they're doing is when
[31:43] they when Martin Luther preach his
[31:45] gospel he divided the wheat from the
[31:47] tears right hey man he divided the wheat
[31:50] from the tears John Wesley he divided
[31:53] the week from the tears william branham
[31:55] Paul Paul divided the wheat from the
[31:58] tears he took them out of the kingdom
[32:02] sent forth his angels and they shall
[32:04] gather know what would you all together
[32:07] now why gathers people the preaching of
[32:12] the gospel is one gathers people right
[32:15] but what does it do brother Brad said
[32:20] God is the segregationist he segregates
[32:23] and that's exactly what he's doing right
[32:24] here but he's not said you're getting up
[32:26] here he already knows what's going on
[32:27] he's segregating here so no man the
[32:30] store the seed the one that's down here
