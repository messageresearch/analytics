in Georgia anyway I'll take it I don't want to live anywhere else let's go through a few of these announcements remember the wedding ceremony and reception on Friday the March 24th everything's downstairs on the um side of the refrigerator it's at 2:00 March 24th it will be be in bufort South Carolina that would be for um whatever her name is Esther and whatever his name is Micah for Esther and Micah I remember that uh coming up in March which will only be a few weeks away and then Terence announced but brother Joe um y'all going to nursing home to this coming weekend at 10:00 those of you that are going get my brother Joe he's here tonight just get with him and make out a plan all right also remember this coming Saturday there'll be no Bible study we're going to have it every other

prayer service now I know that um um brother Lise and brother Bob and brother Michael and sister Nyla Nikki going no what's oh she's here whoops she's here tonight Jordan Jordan River you going too wow you come a little early okay but they're leaving Wednesday so what we Sunday is we're going to have both Services we're going to take up an offering for them the church is going to provide the um plane tickets for Bob and and brother Louise because they're ministers here and they do this from the church so we'll be paying for their for their U plain fair but we'll also be giving them some extra money if you want to give anything the the offering now tithing goes to the CH to whatever you pay your tithing to the church but if you have a special offering um write a check give them cash that will be for them to use over there I thank God that some of our youth are going I wish every one of our youth would go one time overseas you'd come back back with a lot different attitude when you see all the luxuries I was thinking yesterday you look at America and what we call Expendable income which is paying you know $70,000 for a vehicle uh having somebody keep up your lawn for $100 a week you going having a pedicure and a and a and a whatever else that is a med and a petty all the things that you do they just survive over there they can't fathom driving a $70,000 car they can't fathom going and having a new set of clothes every week that's just not in their that's just not in their um budget clean water is in their budget you and I drink water and go get bottle water and we get all this other stuff I thought man all the the reason I saw there was some boats it went by that were being pulled by $70,000 trucks and it's probably a $50,000 uh bass booat and all the other things to go with it I thought man that would take a you could take a whole church in nicaragu and you could build it build a pastor house just by what drove by me one car we've been blessed in this United States but I'll promise you one thing we going to be cursed Above All Nations according to what the prophet said cuz we turn the nation turned God down amen so let's just we're going to pray with them Sunday also before they leave we'll have them come up and we'll um have prayer for them um this coming Sunday so just remember that keep that in your prayer bring some extra money for them

many 15 years maybe or or more we've had this this ever every time had it in three inches of snow what was that a couple years ago or last year sometime last year was it last year we going to pray

Alicia and me and June they bringing us this year you didn't know that did you but just remember that it's to keep everything in order to know what we order because it's going to be a catered meal it's going to be you know close to 20 bucks for a meal per person so um we want to know exactly we don't want to have a bunch of food left over all right so and the church is paying for all that so let's go to the Lord in prayer I I appreciate everyone this weekend back again doing what you did you brought food you you you took out trash uh brother Ryan some of the young guys they took out trash

while they're gone we will uh continue on have service so but just keep them in prayer um it's tough going to another country it really is I mean they they accommodate you the best they can but like I said before we're used to you know clean sheets and and if you heard brother Wayne uh some of his testimony not up here but in private about some of the places he's been that you know just you lay down a board for two or three days a board and you preach your heart out three services a day and they feed you something that he said one time he said he said they said do you want to eat this and he said would I offend you if I didn't' they said no he saidwell I'm not going to eat that because they told him what it was and it was some pretty you know anyway let's go to the Lord in prayer but thank you again have a wonderful New Year we love you with the love of the Lord thank you for all the things you've done this past year if it wasn't for you guys we wouldn't have church a church is Sovereign but you know what the church is Sovereign because of the people it's not sovereign because one man rules the whole place except the Holy Ghost but it's Sovereign because the people are in this building all right it's you that make this thing go not us not us and you pull them the gift tonight and we'll see what the Lord has for us dear heavenly father Lord we pray that you'd be with us in the further of this service Lord come Among Us in a in a way Lord that that we'll all understand Lord that you're trying your best to get your people to see that you're here and that you want the characteristics of your life and your own body to be into this group of people now that we are your body and we're going to talk about that a little bit tonight about a virtuous woman and Lord I pray that you just be with the ones Lord that are sick sister Freda uh brother Louise if I miss one I'm sorry but all the sister Janine different ones Lord I pray that you'd be with them and touch them Lord and take that away from them that they will be raised up Lord especially brother Lis and brother Bob I pray Lord tonight that you would protect them and the ones that are going going to I pray that you would protect them and keep them safe from sickness and from disease and from any kind of form of of um evil that wants to come among them Lord I pray that you would protect them with the angels of the Lord father be with the missionaries on the Foreign Fields and many ones that we hear from Lord Brother um brother Boaz sent messages saying Happy New Year and that they were baptizing people and getting Church A's books out and and Hebrew series books and we thank you Lord for that that they're able to get the word of God here we are sitting with a library that we can put in our pocket and they're just wanting one book lord how fortunate are we please don't let us pass this opportunity by to give this message to A Dying World father we pray that you'd be with us now in the furom of this service in Jesus name we pray amen Dary your stuff blew up over here son of man part 79 all right in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you can go and sit down when we look at this I know we read this every time we read this every Sunday we read this every Wednesday when we preach but that word was made flesh because of a situation that it the Flesh of Adam and Eve fell everybody with me so it's got to come back then through flesh your kinsman redeemer is going to have to be everything he said he was flesh everything he said he was had to come flesh that's why the prophet tells us many many many thousands of time in the message the fullness of the godhead bodily was in Jesus Christ and now we know that by the transforming power of the Holy Ghost that same holy ghost that same person is in me and you all right called the brides so now the word that Jesus spoke is now being made flesh in US dwelt Among Us dwelling Among Us and absolutely supposed to be taking over our life y'all can say Amen if you want to you have my permission proverbs 31 we're going to get to this a little bit this afternoon or this evening who can find who can find a virtuous woman well that's kind of hard to do in this old United States of America and around the world because they can't keep their s and you know what's happened around the world the denominations can't keep their self Satan has crept in so much and give them false Doctrine and a lot of them even in the message because a virtuous woman is a woman that won't take just anything she's pure she's holy she's right she's righteous I'm going to read this to you in just a minute Genesis 2:9 says an out of the ground now we're going to get to knowledge maybe a little bit later but definitely Sunday we're going to talk about knowledge which is the next um virtue and and knowledge my knowledge out brother Wayne was speaking Friday night and he was laying some words out and I was writing them down cuz you can take knowledge to wise unwise know knowledge wisdom Spirit of wisdom understanding being known that's all got to do with knowledge but now there's two kinds of knowledge there's one in the Bible Genesis 2:9 says out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food now that's natural botney life everybody with me say Amen that was botney life he says that little whatever that is semicolon stop and think a minute cuz I'm fixing to change my thought the Tree of Life the tree of life was not a tree it was a person to Jesus Christ everybody with me all right and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil which was the devil everybody with me on that now if they would have eat of the tree of knowledge of I mean of of Life they would have lived tree of life tree of life but no we decided to eat off the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and that's how we got here and that's how that we have even grow up that's why you'll see brother Brown say over here he'll say the education's of the devil well if we let that kind of education rule our life yes it is of the devil if they tell you if science tells you that it was a big bang theory if science tells you that we came from this or that or the other don't take that knowledge we're going to take Godly knowledge because there is a certain thing called Godly knowledge watch this right here but now we want knowledge not just first grade knowledge everybody with me we don't want just first now first grade knowledge is good some of you may have been smart enough to skip a grade some of you may not and missed a grade all right that's natural but in God it's the same way you can sit here in the view and you can you can learn nothing or you can sit here and you can just go right on up that pyramid and the guy sitting beside of you or the lady sitting beside of you is not getting nothing it's up to you remember brother R said he's building individuals we'll read that quote just a little bit Isaiah 289 says Whom Shall teach knowledge so it's got to be taught to you all right and Whom Shall he make to understand what Doctrine you can't do without Doctrine you got to have Doctrine there's what there's false Doctrine and then there's real Doctrine all right all right look and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine he's asking a question and then he's going to answer the question them that are what weaned from the milk not still drinking milk wean from the milk and drawn from the breast listen we draw from elshad we know that the breasted one but you're going to have to get off for them every once in a while you going to have to grow up he don't want you to be a crybaby all your Christian Life he wants just to grow up and eat some what Paul says we'll get to it a little bit later not today but strong meat right that's for us strong as we go up this statue of perfect man I want you to understand this is a Christian Life yall be quiet if you want to Isaiah 53:10 says yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him Heath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days in the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be sa ified by his knowledge by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many so it's a knowledge of God given not to a second person called Jesus it's the same God moving into another office and being able to as the prophet said condescend I want us to see God had to come down here to get us to go there all right so he had to come down here live a life so that we even have an example we have no other example except Jesus Christ all right you want Judas uh please you want Peter you want Peter BC before Christ no you want Paul BC Paul had Christians killed he said he did it wasn't just a rumor it's in the Bible he said I caused him to blaspheme he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant what justify many so now we bringing knowledge together to where it's going to justify many because we're going to read here in just a few minutes where brother Brown calls us The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ Justified never did it in the first place all right that's what you and I got to come to cuz if not you're going to fight you're going to fight your old nature you're going to fight your old person you're going to fight fight fight and we listen it's a fight anyway for he shall bear their iniquities who mine and yours John 17:17 so let's start here now sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is part truth that's not what it said Thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world Jesus Christ so have I also sent them into the world and for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be San ified through the truth through what the truth now what is sanctification it's red is that everybody with me sanctification is red even the second horse rider is red excuse me but sanctification you're only Sanctified by the blood right remember you're kept saved by the blood of Jesus Christ in other words the washing of the Water by the word but that water is blood all right you can pour gallons and gallons of water on top of your head you will not get clean where you need to be clean but but you can take the blood of Jesus Christ and plead the blood of Jesus Christ and God will clean you up amen he'll not be able to see your sin he'll hear your voice through that and I want us to get to that that that also they might also be Sanctified through the truth now I want to look here and stop just for a second now what is sanctification brother R tells us it's a compound word we know this we and I want to give y'all some uh reach reach your hand out like this everybody reach your hand out like this go backwards like this and pat yourself on the back brother Wayne said he had not felt as free to preach in the church as he had here and I mean he may have have but he said this weekend was just it just flowed he didn't have to stop he just went right on through and I appreciate he's because we've been taught well amen and it makes a difference because you don't have to pull see you don't have to if you go to a place that's just been eating you know or drinking milk you got to bring more quotes to prove what you're talking about you got to bring more time to go back and say this but he said no he said I just went St through straight through because we don't we don't need every quote we know them we know them by heart that's why amen quotes you have to amen quotes if somebody reads you a quote you better amen it not their quote brother Brown's quote right so sanctification is clean and set aside for service now we know that in the stuck here somewhere the first part of sanctification though is in your soul it takes and cleans out your soul where does that unclean Spirit go out of let's bring that chart up if you don't mind real quick cuz I want everybody even the young ones to understand what we're talking about I'll give them a second to pull it up there it is all right just can you move it it up a little bit more there you go now we know that we have a body a spirit and a soul everybody WR with me all right we've been through this this is actually a chart that brother Dale used many many years ago all right so we see that the body is what the body is going up to the go to the very bottom because that's where the uh SE taste feel smelling here now there's nothing you can do about that that is given to you as the prophet said to what to contact this world see taste feel smell and hear but every one of those can be absolutely deceived every one of those I I thought I heard a no it wasn't that I thought I saw a like I said before Jun makes many concoctions at the uh Bee store and we can make dirt out of out of out of a liquid cuz man has put the chem chemicals together if you close your eyes and smell that soap it's like somebody's got a piece of dirt in their hand so it can be what these can all be deceived that's why Satan can move in and out through those but he goes on into that middle realm the next one which is what imagination conscious memory reason and affection everybody with me all right now when you're born again when you're born again see if this still works we haven't used it in a long time deby if we do this tonight maybe it keep you awake well you can't really see that can you okay this is your soul this is the person of you right and there's only two things you can be in your soul and that's you can have the faith of God or the doubt of the devil there's no in there's no tweener all right but now when you go through baby form when you go through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost what are we dealing with we're dealing with this guy right here everybody okay we're dealing with this inner man this Center of you the heart that's what God's got to change first man's tried to change here and here but left that alone you got to get in the holy of holies where God is or is not and that unclean spirit that adamic nature that you're that that's attached to your soul when you were born as a baby you got a soul is everybody with me you got a soul uh something that fires you that that's your being it may it help makes you breathe it makes you do all the things of life and it also does what your intelligence this is where your intelligence comes from not here right that's right as a man thinketh in his heart you think no I think out here no you think in here as a man thinketh in his heart so is he all right so now when the Bible says in the Book of Luke that the unclean Spirit goes out of a man it's not here it's here that means there's something that's unclean in your throne room okay as many people in the message say that you've got you've already got this at Birth R said it's not faith and doubt come on somebody it's Faith or doubt you can't have both of these dwelling in a vessel at the same time you're either lost or you born again one of the two all right now you have representation of predestination there is a seed but it's in the mind of God that seed is a word right it's not a little they always try to make it some little speck you know it's little sticky something right here no it's in the word of God the seed is a word of God the seed is not something that's like a seed you plant in the ground and it's definitely not like sperm in reproduction everybody with me okay so we come here and we have either Faith or doubt now you can either have the holy of holies or you can have the Hades of holy one of the two but you're born with a nature Fallen nature Fallen nature okay there's a there's there's an adamic nature attached to you that when you get to the age of accountability listen when you get to the age of accountability that's when God records and thank God that he sent us a prophet that told us that all babies go to heaven and if you're if you're eight N9 10 or years old or somewhere in there and you pass away then guess what you go to heaven you're not bride cuz you can't clean this up like the Holy Ghost can but thank God he can cover you by the blood of Jesus Christ and give you eternal life but now not here though you'll be given eternal life at the white Throne judgment everybody all right okay so now but let's say let's say now we have come to a place that we have been uh Luke verse whatever it is Luke or whatever it is where it says the unclean Spirit goes out so remember the unclean spirit I like where you got these little holes right here the unclean Spirit goes out walks in dry places listen you're not dead you're still the same person but boy you sure think different your nature should be becoming a little bit different there's something in here that's what that's being there's something being taught you there's something being you know the devil hates a word of God so if you'll start putting the word of God in here it drives that unclean Spirit out come on somebody you got you got to really want that thing to be gone and not just go oh I wish oh I wish no start giving it the word of God go to church start cleaning up find the right people you know what if you if you go if you're in the right form of sanctification you'll find the right people you'll not be with the same people because birds of a feather what flock together so now let's say that the unclean spirit's gone out now if if you're if you're going to allow it back you're going to allow it right through back in you're going to be worse seven times worth the Bible says you're going to be really religious and Satan's just going to do what he's going to just make you religious all the way out to here am I correct but if you get born again in here that's the fire of God that's your soul that's your Center being that's your heart you've been given a new heart remember brother B said at the first what does what does God do he softens you up he gives you a new spirit but it's not the Holy Spirit but let me but let me let me restate what he says it's not a devil Spirit it is the holy spirit it's a piece of the Holy Spirit showing you that this can be gone we can lock this in and he can stay there and reside not just come down on you and anoint you because that's anointed ones what is Anointed ones false here true listen to me true here gifts of the Spirit are here they're not here this is one gift acts 238 and you shall receive what the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the one we want more than anything we want the gift of the Holy Ghost he's going to give it to us drive the unclean Spirit out and seal the thing up so Satan can't get in and God can't even get out but you know what he's doing he's he's he's trying to work because you still got the spirit man to work with so now as the unclean spirit's gone out of this man we don't have to worry about this man being unclean anymore we have to worry about this one because this is your Battleground now and why is it a Battleground this is now fighting this when you were not born again this all was devil this all was devil so the devil ain't going to fight himself but when you put the Holy Ghost in here that's his one sworn enemy Satan has no other enemy but God you're not Satan's enemy God is Satan's enemy and vice versa you're not God's enemy Satan is God's enemy but if you keep him inside here you become an enemy of God that's what the Bible says so now the unclean spirit's gone out walks and dry Place seeks rest findest none comes back and sees the house swept and garnished and unless you f it back up with the Holy Ghost you got to be filled with something you can't be wishy-washy you can't be half that's why brother Brown said Faith or doubt not faith and doubt everybody with me Faith or doubt all right so that's in your soul that's the center realm listen that is what's going to be judged your body is not going to be judged your spirit's not going to be judged the soul of man is what's going to be judged at the white Throne judgment The Souls of man the Bible says will have to give an account and praise God you know what if we get the soul of God inside of us it's already given account it's already cleaned and set aside for Ser it's already done that's why brother rown could say we're The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ it transformed you into what a new creation a new person the old done away behold All Things become new but we still live in this world of this guy right here the spirit man which is I say memory reason conscious affection imagination that now has become the Battleground and that part is where we've got to get that unclean Spirit drove out of that part everybody with me all right so it's not just one and done praise God I got born again now you just going to take the baby and throw it in the closet no you got to feed it and you got to feed it what the word of God now not the other junk of the world we feed at the word of God and that's what we're doing now going up to Statue of perfect man there's as brother R tells in Sister Shepherd's dream that there's rocks and sticks all right look if and and he said was she sister Shepherd was asking was she born again he said yes you're born again in other words he was telling her don't worry about that part which is right here but she was standing in what five streams of water that was flowing out of her person not here here come on not here here and showing her that she was born again but she still had what sticks and rocks that's what we're talking about we're not talking about sanctification Lord clean me up so I can be born again I hope that if you're going up to Statue perfect man you have to get past that why why spent so much time on the foundation you got to be born again without even cuz look if you're not born again every one of these will fool you also don't worry about these right here these are just Outlets to let this work out everybody with me all right but right here is what we got to worry about this imagination conscious memory reason and affection which is the Battleground Satan's going this way trying to fight to get back in God's trying to fight to get out that's why we brother Wayne was talking about grave clothes listen we're resurrected sitting in Heavenly places right here amen but we still got grave clothes on I hope can I tap that is that going to break it or I can't see Joe I hope he's not going I don't touch that cuz every time I tap it it makes a difference it looks a little color right here I'm sorry so anyway so you got this right here you got the holy of holies if you're born again you don't have to worry about that let that work its way out a new creation right let that unclean Spirit go out of that part of you and let what let God now start circumcising not your soul circumcising the next part the memory reason conscious affection you remember probably not going to get to the rest of this but we're going to go this way you remember the children of Israel they came out of Egypt right they journeyed in the wilderness of what sin okay right they come over they come out then they got to Jordan right everybody with me they got to Jordan when they crossed over that was their new birth they crossed over watched their old passed away everybody with me but remember when they stepped into that new land as brother Wayne was talking about the old corn of the land they ate not that Mana anymore but also they were what circumcised circumcised means the baptism of the Holy Ghost now why do you need two fillings in type they came out they went through the Wilderness Sanctified you know what he done he got rid of all them old Fighters and remember there was two people left Joshua and Caleb all right then they get to the promised land and God says hold on a minute we got another little thing we got to do here y'all uh y'all made it through the Wilderness just fine but now you're in the what promised land now you're in the promised land now the old corn of the land which is what mature come on people do you not get that what he they're not eating Mana God is going to feed you but there's a day when God's going to say there's corn in this land that's now mature you don't eat corn in the stock you don't eat corn when it's about that big make you sick as a dog but you can eat corn when it's on when it's got fully matured ears you can shook that baby back and eat it all day long but what has it done it's matured and when you eat mature you become mature you are truly we are what we eat not just this we are what we eat in the gospel and the world and all the different things everybody with me on this so your soul if it's born again tonight it is trying its best to work its way out into the imagination conscious memory reason affection the Little Devils so now unclean Spirit goes out of what goes out of now in our spirit realm remember the old Indian had no problem when he was when he not born again like he said he said Chief now has two dogs okay when you were not born again when you were out in the world you were dog from here to there and everything in between but when you got the Holy Ghost you had so much of a of a nature of this world till it's all got to be contrary to the devil the devil is contrary to everything that you are now and when you go up this statue of perfect man it's going to be even more that you're going to have to fight for every inch of ground greatest battle ever fought it's not in your soul if you're born again that battle is over step into the promised land and take what's yours which is what these promises of of Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness I kind of uh got a chance to talk to brother Wayne about that and he may be watching in I don't know but still I told him I said you know you realize fa not an ad and he just looked at kind of strange he kind of said I said show me in the Bible where it says add to your faith faith is a new birth because listen there's only seven ads we've been through this don't look at me crazy for those new ones maybe you can look at me a little crazy but look if you take and keep Faith here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7even eight there's not eight ads there's seven add to your new birth 1 2 3 4 5 six s that makes it right it's my faith now add to my faith virtue so maybe we can say a few things maybe that you don't think we not very smart around here sometimes we can confound the wise by just the little things you say but it's it's terminology but it's the truth though because Faith's not an ad you add to your faith you add to your new birth your new birth listen if you get born again and never go up that pyramid you still going to have little small nuggets of that right cuz that's inside of you everything you need for your journey what the prophet say is right here all right you just got to do what let it out you ever heard that before let it out so what about all these virtues watch neither did the Paul have any virtue in it not a bit in other words this word has no virtue in it if you make it of none effect you by your Traditions make this what Paul said what the letter kth but the spirit giveth life but it was obeying what God Said do is what brought the power what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of God so if you're not born again tonight know one thing's for sure you're lost now you can be in a journey of justification and sanctification don't stop don't keep going cuz you know what that unclean spirit that comes out of you is going to walk back W back in so bad cuz he was comfortable there everybody with me on this it was comfortable for me to go to a bar I didn't go to many but I did sorry it was BC but you know why because that's what was pulling me inside was that thing inside of me that did not want to do right I didn't want to come to church maybe I'm the only one I didn't want to that inside of me he didn't want to but one day the seed word that was in the mind of God found me and said hey I've had enough of you that's right and I hope you've had enough of him the devil and I did I said Lord I've had enough of this tired of running if you've never experienced that you need to amen you need to experience that we sing the song the things I do I do no more and all that it's a it's a it's a For Real Thing the things I used to do I don't do them anymore 1 Samuel 15 says Samuel was talking about um PSAL says ha the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord there's a lot of people and I'll read you a quote probably Sunday brother R today's a lot of people in the world natural people that have part of these virtues but but they're not god-given they're nature given you you've seen people there's some people in the world that you work with or you're acquainted with or even it's your friends with that you could slap them and knock them over into into a a wall and they just say thank you buddy especially if you all been drinking together but you they certain people you don't touch and you know that right you don't even look in their Direction well that's just people and nature but if you'll get both of them Born Again where's the ups and downs it's not there anymore so behold obey is better than sacrifice in other words what are you saying brother way I'm coming back to this because it cost Saul his kingdom right it cost saw the Kingdom of Israel whether he wasn't supposed to be king or not he was King the people people made him a king and God accepted it at the moment but he said Saul the kingdom been rent from you just because of one thing amen one thing you didn't obey what your Prophet said oh come on somebody you didn't you didn't do what your Prophet said your Prophet said kill them all obey is better than sacrifice to hearken than the fat of Realms oh listen read in your Bible s preached a pretty good sermon hey we saved this King so we can maybe convert him and we saved all these Rams so we can sacrifice them to the Lord that didn't mean one thing to God cuz he had said something through the prophet and he didn't do it so it didn't matter about that for Rebellion as as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry that's pretty rough the brother M tells us we're not building an organization not here this morning want to build an organization we're not trying to build an organization here we're trying to build individuals Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be the what the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word by his word see build up the individual to that place and it all starts with virtue the whole multitude start to touch him why they want to te touch him why didn't they want to teach touch a Roman soldier why didn't they want to touch cus you ever thought about that was the man of the hour Caius was their preacher cus was their Pastor they relied on Caius to go once a year behind the holy of holies and not die s and to give what to give uh a sacrifice for the whole country of Israel they depended on him but did they go run into him when they needed something that's what made them mad right that's what made Kus mad they run right by Kus to get to Jesus and that what righteous indignation because his soul was black as such but he kept every ordinance heaving and waving and cutting and chopping and killing this one and and taking this one you know and taking the blood and going behind the the holy of holies seems like he lived a pretty good life but in the end he turned the word down because where was the word in flesh Jesus said you would have had a cloak if I hadn't come in other words you would have had the Old Testament as long as you didn't touch a woman you didn't commit adultery with her right that was what the Old Testament didn't say about looking or or thinking but Jesus said now I say unto you that if you look on a woman to lust after in your heart you've committed adultery with her already and they didn't like that CU they had been doing it all their life amen that's right virtue anyone knows that the word virtue means what we must have and we must have it if virtue went from him to heal the woman that was sick he's expecting the same virtue in his church now where's that virtue going to come from that Center that Center person the center realm all right because you know what that's God in there brother R said you and God is persons the only two times he used the word vulcanize was two times I think in the whole um 1100 something sermons but it was very profound because what is vulcanization Jonas you don't know what that is do you buddy he he when Jonas don't understand something his eyebrows go together and that's okay because when we had bicycles yeah we had bicycles that we fix we didn't take them to a bike town and have them fix it for us everybody with me on that amen we put our own handlebars on it we put our own we put our own patches on patches but what is vulcanization is taking something this Rubber and taking a rubber tube and if there's a hole in it if he's riding down a dirt road and R it to if you hit a rock just R in the side we all know this those of us that rode bicycle it would puncture that tube and just knock a little hole in it and down it went well Dad would go and he'd go up to the store and he'd buy a little patch kit or you know what sometimes if he could find the glue he made his own patch out of what another piece of rubber so that word vulcanization means that you take two pieces you take Rubber and rubber and what you would do you didn't you just didn't just You' clean it off look Jonas you clean it off real good kind of score it a little bit cuz what you were going to do was is take a same piece of rubber and try to get it to stick on there so the air wouldn't come out of it well what you did you didn't just depend on the glue come on somebody this is good I hope this helps it's not just a glue that we depend on that glue may be a spot dad used to take that man he just brush it on I thought that thing will never never leak again but he takes it out of his pocket or he goes in the house and gets him a gets him a lighter or gets him a match and he and he hits that thing and when he hits it it it starts flaming it gets that rubber just hot enough right before it melts all down to nothing and he clap that other patch on it what' it do it made both of them patches one of the patch in the tube it made it one come on somebody same way with me and you I and my father are one one pack Hey listen we needed to be patched up but listen if God himself patched us up it's rubber to rubber tough crowd on Wednesday night y'all need sleeping about an hour or two before you come to church he's expecting the same virtue in his church what rubber to rubber but I see Jonas you couldn't took a piece of wood couldn't took a piece of wood in a tire tube that's rubber you whatever you did it didn't matter that would not stick together but if you took and vulcanized and heated up this Rubber and heated up this Rubber and put the enough glue around it and when you slap on there when it cooled off you could not pull that patch off y'all remember you can't pull the patch off and that's what I wanted when I was going down the road about 20 miles hour on the bicycle I didn't want another hole in my tire in the in life I didn't want to go down the road of life and then all of a sudden have a flat but if you vulcanize to the right person and if he had virtue to give to the people he expects us to have virtue to give to the people and what is virtue virtue is strength and power remember we read the quote the other the day where brother brownan said we got to have virtue for the whole world this whole world today I declare to you today 2023 January the 4th this world is only held together by the bride it is not held together by gold it is not held together by Putin it is not held together by that other guy we have and it's not held together by none of that it's not held together by economy it's Together by The Bride of Jesus Christ still being here to come to maturity listen the plant as brother Wayne was talking about the sheath wave we haven't all come to maturity yet there's some that maybe have but you're not going to go out there just c one come to maturity and just cut the whole field down you wait it's showing that someone has come to maturity but he's waiting on the whole field to what as we say in in in in our terminology of garden waiting it for it to head out cuz when it heads out it makes the same seed that you put in the ground amen and that and that what brother R said we're not to shook we're not the stalk we're not the tassel we're the seed we're what was went in the ground what and the only seed is Jesus Christ it's not me and you we were born by corruptible seed but by the transforming Power by vulcanization he took that old nature that old seed that you were and he made a wheat germ out of it I'll read you that quot in just a minute before you can give out virtue you have to have it so add that to your faith virtue understand remember she didn't touch him physically talking about the woman touched His Garment she touched His Garment but she pulled out what she needed listen she may have needed some money cuz for 12 years she couldn't work for 12 years she couldn't go anywhere she was totally unclean if you sisters know what I'm talking about in the Old Testament if you if you were on your monthly cycle you were clean you couldn't be touched your husband couldn't touch you you couldn't go into the market you couldn't go into this Temple for sure then when you were took the cleansing of the seven days later you could go and you know your natural life would continue on but this lady had been 12 years every day she was probably anemic probably couldn't hardly walk because of her blood loss but she pulled one thing she needed to be healed she didn't need a new car she didn't need a new leg she didn't need for the Lord to give her extra money she needed that blood to stop so whatever issue you have ask the Lord to stop it touch His Garment one time and let's see if we can get all this stuff stopped and get everything pulled back into the right direction cuz the word pull Ren tear perform carry out look to draw the supporter attention of that's why attract the third pull brother Brown the three PS was what to attract the attention of the people and what were the three pulls one was the what in the hand watch this pull my pull the chart back up there please if I don't get any further than this that's okay we got next Sunday pull the chart back up please cuz Bob preached on this a long time ago and so did I about the three polls of your journey and it's in that if you can see it and all that and all that going on you got the third pole second pull first pole what was the first Paul flesh see taste fil smelling here see see this see this if there's no bumps you're healed he'd say look lady you still got that then he'll talk to her about five more minutes and then he'd say oh look lady it's gone flesh you can see it right but now what was the next pull the second pull was what discernment pulled out of you what you were here and the third pull was when he look right down in the opening of the word because you know what there was a lot of people got healed in this Spirit realm that didn't get healed in the soul you know brother brown one time he he's talking to one he said oh I see you're a Christian so you know what that inside person what's comfortable with him but he then there would be another one walk up and he'd say oh you've got uh cancer in your lung he said but if you'll quit smoking and give your heart to God now what was he looking at he wasn't looking in these two Realms right here he was looking right there he was in that guy's throne room he was saying you need the new birth he said if you'll go confess your sins to God he said you'll get better discernment pulled out the virtues sanctification what was he doing he was literally if he was brother Danny if he would have stayed here another 50 years he'd have cleaned the world up think about it 25,000 outstanding miracles in one service one service if he'd still be living today he'd be hund and something years old but think about if he stayed here what kind of an impact he would have had on the whole world world they'd had to do away with the medical field what was he doing he was cleaning them up so that he could what preach to their soul CU that third pull is what the opening of the word the opening of the word is not here the opening of the word is here look word revealed yeah you can get pieces as the foolish version we'll get pieces of Revelation but never have God in their Throne Room they've never come to the son of man Revelation or the opening of the word so you got your hand discernment and then you've got the inner Court the opening of the word there's only one place listen brother brandham had to come to a place before he could open the word to us Revelations 5 the book was closed Revelations 10 the book was open there had to be a place to where that book opened up everybody all right then he's talking about the disciples about how turning our hearts back to the faith of the fathers if you want to know how to act read the book of Acts that's what that means acts of the Apostle how could they know it was a nod from God they had all these virtues in here all of these qualifications all right so that we talk about us being a special group of people and how that we're prophetic people and how that we're an open book people they weren't they didn't have the seals open to them they didn't know when he said I'm the son of man he they didn't know who he was they knew he was the son of God they knew he was God and that had come down somehow in some form but he they didn't have a son of man Revelation but yet they had what are you saying brother Wade you can have these virtues and not have the son of man Revelation cuz that's the Son of God brother Wayne was touching on that's a Son of God Revelation down through the church ages not son of man Son of God was trying to get us back to the virtues what faith of the fathers everybody all right and the first little nod of God compared with every bit of this and with his word they know it was the word of God listen they didn't even have a Bible they were writing it as they were talking they were a living breathing word of God you and I need to get back to a living breathing word of God they know it was the word of God and away they went didn't have to worry about nothing when God spoke they went they were taught by the word himself then we're talking about we'll just kind of skip through this I want to cover this again next week about the horse writers let's just get through that for time was 20 after 8 and he talks about that's what we just been talking about in Revelations 2 ver4 he's talking about the Ephesian Church age he said I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love I mean the first three ages man that it was powerful in the first there was no denominational idea there was no we think Jesus might be God we think we need to baptize father son Holy Ghost no they knew how to baptize they knew that God and Christ were one but serenus and all the different ones started coming in saying well maybe he's a like sub he can't be all of God we saw him throw up one day he was sick he fell and broke his leg not broke his leg but fell and skin his knee that can't be God and then that what that steam rolled remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works that's what brother Brandon was trying to get us to do get back to the first works all right or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove your Candlestick out of its place except th repent but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate which is that what tree of knowledge of Good and Evil he that hath a near let him hear what the spirit sath to the church is to him that overcometh so it's got to be an overcoming with the true power of God because we know we're we're going to look at a false power Sunday because we have the knowledge of Good and Evil and we have the tree of life we have two trees all right let's look at this just for a moment now remember we're going to interpolate a little bit in just for a few minutes Proverbs 31:10 I told you before uh historians if you go back and read in the history this is Solomon writing Proverbs right and he's writing about his mama bash Sheba who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above Rubes now here's a man that was a multi in in today's money he was a multi he was in the trillions of dollars that he owned Solomon was trillions of dollars he had gold he just had could throw away but he said a virtuous woman is way way past that a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband who's our husband I got a husband you've got a husband it's Jesus Christ and we're we're not only going to Crown Him king of kings and Lord of lords we are his crown brother Brown said we're his victory without us who's going to prove the Resurrection The Devil oh no the devil got into them got into cus and them said oh a took his body out and throw it somewhere and and you know they they stole his body and then they ate him cuz he said eat my flesh and drink my blood but a virt virtuous woman a virtuous bride let's put that in there The Virtuous bride of Christ is a crown to her husband but she didn't maketh ashamed as as rotness in his bones that's the denominational World they make God ashamed people they made me ashamed by the way they walk into their churches by the way they treat their churches they treat them just like brother R said they're lodges that's the way he they treat them they treat it just like a meeting joint for you go to and and and be able to talk about first one thing and another and then sit down for few minutes and listen to a preacher I had my cousin today Terry Dale I'm calling his name cuz he's probably he said he was going to be here Sunday but he's uh singer and U he said he was going to come and I told him I said he said what time y'all start I said 9:45 preaching I said no we have Bible study our our Sunday school class he said when do preaching start I said well about 10:20 I mean 10:40 we start preaching he said what time you get finished I said about 12 hour and 20 minutes I said yeah and I could go further than that hour in 20 minutes he said well I think I'll just come he said now what he's our cousin you can pick your friends but you can't pick your family um he said well he said well what if I come in at 11: how much am I going to miss of your sermon that's their mentality they only want a certain amount and that's it they only want to Ser they only going to get their little 20 minute feel-good service and then how long do y'all sing he says cuz he's a singer I said when now we start singing about 10:15 he said I'd like to hear y'all sing I said well you going to have to endure for about two hours then from 10:15 to 12 I said because I preach after that he said I'd like to hear you singing see what mean they've diverted everything away from the word of God Amen to their own pleasure pleasure me but don't pleasure me but about 20 minutes a Sit three hours and watch a football game and never move well they move all right yeah they move that's for sure so let's read this right here just real quick and then we'll close a virtuous woman the bride of Christ may I interpolate that because this is not the Bible this is coming from the internet so I'm not I'm not desecrating the word of God I'm not adding to it or taking from it I'm telling I'm telling you this is the story I get from this statement a virtuous woman the bride of Christ cares for her family family she is a hard worker this bride of Jesus Christ while she toils Faithfully in meeting the needs of her own family she also doesn't forget to help the other needy people God sends to Nicaragua are the Philippines are Jamaica or Ireland or India a virtuous woman also takes the time to look after her own health H and be a good Steward of her body I'm pointing back here amen that's you that's not listen folks look this is not the congregation I just read you the quote it's individuals this is you or not you it's not you and your wife it's not you and your kids it's not you and your pastor that's you so a virtuous woman takes time to look after her own health I read my own Bible I don't depend on Bob to read the Bible for me of course some of y'all probably do you come to church on Sunday and you had read a Bible all week and you expect us to give you something well I'll preach anyhow so our virtuous bride of Christ meaning applies to the heart and then to every area of Life memory reason conscious F imagination the bottom line is a virtuous woman the Bride of Jesus Christ goes into the strength of the Lord and Faithfully completes whatever task God has for her to do when a person is described as having virtue it is seen as a quality that sets one apart from everyone else look in character strength and morality people look at the morals of this world it's like I said before think about it when we get to Glory there not going to be cheaters there there not going to be Liars there you know what they will be though there will be an economy there'll be rulers Kings there'll be Governors the Bible says the government will be on his shoulder but it won't be this messed up government we got now we're the only people that have any sort of morality it's just Katie Bar the Door out there folks it is a common characteristic look common characteristic that can be found within the mindset of several women in the Bible from Ruth to Esther to Mary as well as described of others through celess virtues verses the virtuous person exhibits The Joint Excellence of reason and of character all right The Virtuous person The Virtuous bride of Jesus Christ not only knows what the good thing to do is we've been taught what's good if you've got the new birth you will do what's good in your soul but now you might let that second guy remember the little thing that sits on your shoulder called the devil he don't leave when you get the new birth now he brings another friend and he sits on this side you look at me funny I'm I the only one that has these problems I'm sometimes I just wonder y'all look at me like what you talking about we're preachers but we're people and he's got his gun pointed on us before y'all sometimes cuz he knows what I'm going to preach before y'all do he feels the anointing he feels to pull The Virtuous bride of Christ not only knows what the good thing to do is he or she is emotionally attached some of y'all ought to be emotionally attached preach it brother go dog that's what the world says can't we go Jesus go bride amen [Applause] all right musicians get ready to come on predestination looks back to for knowledge I mean election election looks back to for knowledge and predestination looks to Destiny when we get finished with this I'm going to probably cover a little bit on predestination but it's very very simple if you'll understand predestination is very simple uh it just gets convoluted by other people remember the Common People heard him gladly it was the wise that was confounded but the ones that were wise in their own conceit were confounded and their own conceit don't forget that election looks back here here it is I was a cuar now how you going to take this quote and make it match all the other quotes you got to understand what he's talking about I was a conar in my throne room was the life of a cucker not wheat or when I sprang out I'd have produced wheat I didn't produce wheat I was a coer have you ever walked through the woods some of you already to get out walk through the woods and talk to God he's out there but you get these things on your leg we used to call them what call begar Li it's actually beggar Li but we forget all them other RS and E and call it begal right d yeah but begal had little things on it you know and it would you walk through and it just stick all over you we've had to walk through many times me and Dad went through we were somewhere hunting one time we got down finished and we got down to the car and from here down was nothing but that and some cuckle bur we had to take our knife and scrape that stuff off praise God we got it all scraped off I hope somebody's getting this thank God God we got it all scraped off but the cuar is what we were and a cuar is not just one it's a bush of them you don't get just one cuckle bear you get bunches I was a cule bear what and you know what them things hurt them things hurt when you get them in the wrong place back of your leg rear end and all that other stuff don't sit out on one well that's what it is in sin people that's exactly the way we were we were totally uncomfortable I was a cuar I was born in sin come on musicians I was shaped in iniquity came to this world speaking lies born amongst Sinners this is a prophet telling us what he was I was a cuckle bar but all of a sudden may I interpolate by the transforming power of the Holy Ghost I became a wheat grain amen now it didn't change the outside it still look like a CER how did it happen what is it election God before the foundation of the world elected that that c cucker was to become a grain of wheat now I know I'm a grain of wheat because I'm saved right how do I do it look back and see that what he predestinated it not down here there thank God long time ago by for knowledge he seen that I would love him so he made a perpetuation what a way he made a way that he could break that cuckle bear open praise God and put wheat life down in there and lock it back up but you know what if you plant it what's it going to bring wheat CU it's a life of the wheat inside you might have been born in sin born from your Mom and Daddy don't know who your mom and daddy is but I'll promise you you get baptized with the Holy Ghost you'll bring forth wheat life no more cucker but now listen we going to have a sticky nature cuz remember that outside shell is still a cuar hello somebody brother R said this thing's going to be sticky till the change that's why we're trying our best to get through this statue of perfect man so that we'll have the knowledge of God not the knowledge of the world okay let's stand to our feet he made a perpetuation through his own son that through him I might become see look through him not what I did not what the preacher did but through him through his own son that through him I might become from a cule bear to a grain of wheat now where am I'm at where am I at I'm saved I'm walking in The Graces of God what does predestination look to Destiny where will he take me to and where am I going that's got you there you are let's read this real quick your first husband that you were married to the world that middle part the anointed bridegroom Jesus Christ which foreordained you has washed you by the washing of the Water by the church congregation says no that don't sound right does it you might find that in Almanac but not in God's Bible by the washing of the Water by the word in the word see you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message it was a Thanksgiving message actually in streetport Louisiana as we go off the air just in a minute you are standing if you're standing on God's word and with God's word every amen some of yall to try that every jot every TT where you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them Shucks and get out here in the wheat where you can get right before the s o n I hear the coming of the combine you're standing completely Justified like you never did it in the first place Hallelujah talk about a Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more thankful for that than in other words turkey and dressing you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and wa and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned in the first place amen you are perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ let us be glad rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his mature wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be ar raid in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is a righteousness wait a minute it's does that say the righteousness of God no I don't see that in here do you I got this I I I copied and pasted it right out of the Bible and to her was granted that she should be ar raay in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of you not the Saints before the righteousness of you you have become righteous and now I want us to talk we're going to talk about knowledge Sunday I I want you to know that knowledge is knowing brother Brown said knowing how to handle the word of God knowing what's right and what's wrong knowing when a false Doctrine is being preached let me read this one thing right here look at this knowledge signifies in general intelligence watch the general knowledge of Christian religion and the deeper look at this the deeper more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion religion such as belongs to the more advanced now baby the more advanced especially if things lawful and unlawful for Christians moral wisdom such as is seen in right living let's sing a song God bless you Satan like a roaring line r into and from seeking whom he mayour the Bible tells me and many Souls have been his [Music] praise but God he promised they're in the word of God we don't have to go hunt them they're in the word of goding power greater is he that is in Meer is he that is in me oh greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and on the day of Pentecost a rushan mighty wind blew into the upper room and baptize all of them with the power greater than any Earthly F and I'm so glad I've got it too I'm going to let the whole world know oh greater is he that is in Me Greater is he he that is in Me Greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world oh greater is he that is in me yes greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world and on the day of Pentecost a rushan mighty wind blew into the upper room bti all of them and when the power greater that's why it's overcoming Earthly foes you don't have to about flesh and blood it's principalities and powers and evil spirits that's what we have to worry about is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world you believe that when that power comes in into you it makes you an overcomer but he wants you to continue on not be a baby be an adult be able to I like that word advance I took Advanced Algebra I liked it because a lot of people didn't understand it but I did but I like when you say Advanced because you know what if you're advanced in God and your head blows up and you think you better than somebody else you're not advanced in God you're advanced in the devil but when God ADV does advances you and places you it humbles you that God can give you a revelation that he give Hey listen now the world there's 8 billion people now it went to 8 billion used to be seven for a long time 8 billion people in this world 99.99% of that 8 billion people do not have what you have and never will have what you have tonight I want you to use that power use that power against the devil don't let him beat us down loose them let him go we can walk in the word of God we can use our hands we can use our mouth and we can defeat the Devil I promise you he's defeated already he just don't know it but he's going to be defeated through the Bride of Jesus Christ it's going to be a woman
