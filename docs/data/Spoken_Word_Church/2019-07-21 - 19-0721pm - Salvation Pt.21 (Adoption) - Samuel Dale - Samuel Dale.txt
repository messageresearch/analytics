look around I'm not finding I mean good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you'd like to turn back in your scriptures where we were this morning to Ephesians 2 and Ephesians 1 and then Romans 8 we will try to get it on with our thought and someone asked me to comment on something I spoke on our Wednesday but I'll not do it today because you take a whole message to answer a comment so we will try to do that later okay just remember probably one for another remember the sick one sometimes and keeping touch with all of these that are sick so you know us we're so backward till we can't keep in touch so you have to keep in touch with us all right we're not to set up to handle all of it you I try to call people and there's no like news call and leave a message if they called me back cuz I'm not able to do all of these things on the computer so I'm sorry for that but at least I can call and say call me back you don't get the message that I'm sorry but just remember pray one for another the Lord willing brother Aaron will be ministering for us Wednesday so remember that waiting they'll be on their way back tomorrow and many others are traveling so keep them in your mind Ephesians two and eight definitely father we thank you for thy grace and love thank you for all things because we know that all things are given unto it freely should we thank you just have you away with our hearts and our lives forgive our sins keep us in your grace let your light and your love be with each one got us now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and deliver us from ourselves because that's our main point we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen visions 2 and 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of works that now just say excuse me it is the gift of God okay back up just one page and we'll start verse 3 chapter 1 seasons let's be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Christ by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace were in he hath made us accepted in the beloved okay let's go to Roman's 8:14 whereas minis are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear which you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together you may be seated Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word and try to continue I thought what was it this morning we've been talking on the new birth that it is justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes the new birth okay alright and in doing that then all people who receive the new birth and we're not talking about the points of you know where you come in to your anointed ones or anything like that we're talking about the new birth all who received the new birth it's the same new birth there's not a new birth for this group of people and a new birth for that group of people it's the same new birth whoa you know a baby and the natural it's the same natural things of a birth happens you know no matter who it is so then all is the same it doesn't matter you say well we're not worth it no we're not any different it's always the same and each age had the new birth it was the Holy Ghost in each age to shine forth to the people of that age and to give a new birth all right so then all that received the new birth have to go through justification sanctification and the baptism with the Holy Ghost yeah but all I done was just didn't see your your own to what I was saying this morning the new birth is the new birth you crying shouting feelings emotions all of that goes with the new birth yes because you can't I don't believe in having a stillborn birth I believe in having emotional feelings with a new birth I believe in all of the expressions of shouting crying and seeing visions or hearing angels or whatever I believe I'll listen through your experience and I'll agree and believe it you know but then I just turn back and ask the same question that did and always have what is the new birth well it's not the shouting in the crime that's the after-effects that's the baby after it gets here it's going to cry but you know what I found with the babies there to show you that they're all the same I've never I've never noticed any of these babies back here that were from different countries you know when they cry they all cry an American right I mean I can understand them can't you all right they all cry the same I've never heard a dog you know and I've been in foreign countries and things you know and then brother Brady that we gonna get at Oh peacock that was one peacock I wanted to eat for lunch or supper but that's all right but they all sound the same all right see it's growing up and what we're we're all set in the stages of things that determines a lot of things to us all right but still the new birth is the new birth and everybody has the same new birth you say you have a distant shouting no that's not to birth that's all I've tried to get you to see that's not the birth the birth is preceded to that that is the after a fact as that's trying to express this morning I say you know if you want to be prayed far for for sickness or salvation come down here we'll see it's settled when you get up when you get up and walk this way itself cause you doesn't made up your mind you doesn't set it in motion all I do is just pray for the Lord to do things and I like the way brother used to pray he had a unique way of praying for people and and he would pray this away he'd say Lord said now they're seeking the new birth and said now Lord would you give just a little tug on the heart to let them know you know that you have accepted them well I like that because that gives something and I believe in those believing all kind of signs and wonders I believe in all things of manifestation but put it in the order of the way that it is and then it won't follow and then now I'm serious now you study the prophets message you're gonna find a lot of things that you read that this sounds different from that right you'll read something this will sound that's right in the same book in just a minute it sounds like he's talking about something else but when it's finished it all ties together if we allow it to be tied together all right see then we come through giving the scriptures that we've been giving you know how that we have the earnest of our inheritance and the earnest means a part payment and we're all born again first Corinthians 3:1 and two we're all just babies in Christ he said oh no brother there I was blown away up here cuz I had a great knowledge I don't believe that I'm sorry I believe the new birth is a sign sure they're not a word that you have and I understand determines how much you operate in God how much as God can use you yes and things like that but the point of getting at the birth is the same well let's get the baby born then we worry about the other cause see we've got to go through adoption we've got to go through the stature of a perfect man we got to go through all of the growth development of Christianity that's never now he's saying have you come into message the you know yourself you never heard about adoption always sir we talk about adoption in the Baptist Church but we just talked about adoption we didn't know what it was but we didn't know we were adopted into the family I mean I've heard Baptist preachers preach on how you're adopted into the family you know we preached a few things but we didn't have the understanding of what it was to do the Prophet had to come and bring those things unto us all right let's see it we have to have milk to grow you give a baby milk you don't give it meat you give it milk and it grows by that milk that it's brought are the nutritions and things that's within it and all and you turn out then to start growing all right then as you grow you know it becomes a little more the difference in your life and some have a big appetite and some don't we've told you about Jocelyn y'all should be set and ironed you'll be trying to feed him you'd have a spoon in one hand and a bowl with this food in it well this is the way you had to feed him you had a pacifier over here and you'd go and stick it in his mouth or as quick as you pull that out of his mouth you pop that pacifier into his mouth cause if you didn't he's gonna start screaming and hollering cause he wanted to eat well I like to see a Christian either way it likes to eat you know enjoy it have a good time okay now we're getting down to the port we're all wind up to be babies in Christ because everybody is born to baby okay all right then we'll get to it as brother branham goes along in the adoption know series I had a few laying at home where he talks about how you know you say oh let's see what did they say that one you said when I was born again tonight yesterday and today I'm going to preach he said nonsense now that's his words he says nonsense it's because you don't do that he come right off the bar the barroom put him up to preach he said that's not correct they don't set out learn a little bit get a little settled in the gospel then turn them loose don't put a novice and I love that I love the way the Lord Jesus does there's not a one of the please one of the writers in the Bible that was not present in the upper room now you have maybe a little argument over some of the little minor things but still just remember what I'm getting at God don't use the novice to bring his word he used someone settled in the word to speak that word because he's going to how to answer for his own word and he loves to do it alright but now let's get to the point to pick up what we're talking about we're trying to repeat a little bit for the purpose of understanding all right because we're all babies and we all desire the sincere milk Paul said of the word that we may grow thereby it's all by the word you notice that everything that I read this morning at our Wednesday it'll say and the word and the word because the new birth is the birth of the word right all right now as I emphasized this morning on that see the new birth is the birth of the word and that three thousand outside they had to hear a message because you can't be born again without hearing well I didn't hear nobody but I hang my Bible well that's somebody you know that was written by somebody all right see then the point of all tried to get you to see is that baby it needs the correct food to grow you can give it to wrong food and then it'll it'll turn different but you give it to right food you want it to grow and you want it to mature in the correct children all right now in doing that then you use oh if you'll get the simplicity of what I'm trying to say I'm trying to say it over and over enough to where you hear it if the new birth is the birth of the word they didn't a statue of a perfect man is that hard to understand it's the birth of the word adoption where brother Branham says we'll read it in a little while he says you're born to son all right what said then you need adoption all right well there's any problem that's just we need more word all right see that's why I said this morning emphasize just a tad let's see all of the whole thing here regardless of what words you had in other words you started off with the Apostles in the book of Acts and part of that group that was there were originals and they had the adoption of that day they didn't have the full adoption but they had the adoption for that day in time honor and as they did they could teach others but it wasn't long until that way begins to die down it lasted till about somewhere into the fourth church age all right then Satan begin to take away and take away until when you come into the field church age you've got Martin Luther with the just shall live by faith just barely getting started but he got started that's what I'm warning you to see in a minute when I say it so I'll say it now listen what a wonderful thing it is know brother Colley seventy years old never lose everything talk to him slowly loudly it's been 75 well you get her dirt old I am her brother Colley now it wouldn't matter I'm making an illustration it wouldn't matter what his dad done in life he could be a murderer he could be this that or the other but it'd still be his daddy and he wouldn't change his name he keeps the name Kali you know and he wouldn't be ashamed of his dad anyway he'd be ashamed about what his dad done yeah what do you still honor the fact that he had a father you know what because one day he was a son one day James Colley was a child Oh Kali come into the world of selling ever born-again believer now listen I'm making a statement it's gonna take me three or four months to Bree ever born-again believer if you're truly born again you're a son or daughter of God all right you know what that means we're heirs then we'll get to that in a minute in Romans we're heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ so whatever they have we have it a son of God came sin enough to be lost that's gonna take months and you can't send enough to be lost remote said that no he said everybody's always worried about this Saturday he said you can't send enough to be lost no gonna do you're not gonna do it God's gonna take you off the same right now every child is born the child of God if you have a really new birth that makes you a son or daughter of God what a wonderful thing what a wonderful thing has happened to us in the human race that God has given his life he died for the purpose to release that life that you and I could become his children what a wonderful opportunity and to realize if you are truly born again you can never be lost you said you meaning I can this go out live like the devil that means you never was born because you don't want to do that brother Kali didn't run all over the country claiming to be a Jones he goes into the military you know what's your name Jones who we have here name is Kali well that was my life and yet illegally had a change so it wouldn't work well listen you get what I'm saying what a wonderful opportunity it is to be a child of God so how God is your father how great of an opportunity what would you want any greater I mean faith came to me right now and said what we want you to do we want you to resign as being a pastor a church then we want you to run for president and we guarantee you you're going to get it that's it going back and forget it yeah we're gonna we're gonna give you the president I don't want I would be degrading my own human thinking to step from this pulpit out into the world to become president of the United States well if you become president you could change law don't go that away don't try to to make your movie out of your life okay you know what I mean you ain't never seen the movie we sit and watch it's kind of our thing our home and and we can see some of the old movies you know little short ones about Bible people you know Moses David whatever and nanny she'll said Terrence you say well is that scriptural I said well in a way I mean it's closing some things but it ain't always right but the thing of it is see it won't sell movies if you told the truth right you think about it if you wrote a book of lat about Obama not throwing off on them it's using tonight let's go to Kennedy you write a book about Kennedy you know and boy you you make a book if you told it like it is it wouldn't say oh so you got to make him go over here make this happen that happen huh and you rewrite the story well that's what everybody wants in Christianity but that's not what I want I want something that I can enjoy nigh on I want something that I can have a good time in it I know how to prop it up I don't how to make it up and tell lies you know when you feel so bad about it me saying I've seen an angel two or three time he's that well people what do you think they're trying to I don't care what you think I'm telling what I saw what you think about it ain't nothing to me that's between me and God let's see that's that way I can keep it to where I want it to be a child of God it's the most wonderful thing that anyone could ever think about being could you see I can drop down a little further for them to come and tell me say you deny your doctrine of what you teach and we'll make you president I said go top it buddy get on cuz I wouldn't give up what I believe for nobody or for no opportunity of all the money in the world could be piled up no see a child of God is a wonderful marvelous supernatural opportunity that you can believe in a God that can come down and deliver you from all kinds of things like that man that we're talking about sister Julie asking I believe wouldn't it about it I've heard it in there the worry had like what five heart attacks massive heart attacks well somebody prayed and believed cook you don't have that well and get out of it well you know he's out of it he was not yet never told you yet about her eyes did you ever you never reported much about that heavy that's you're out of where where you got hit and you know everything gone out of it yeah she had a testimony to tell you she needs to deliver that no she's got bumped and her I went blurred no it's back right thank God thank God you said well that is gonna happen thank God for the happening I don't care just called it happened I love it I love the fact you're thinking about being a Christian and you realize the entire Bible huh I didn't mean to pretenses okay you realize the entire Bible is yours you don't think sometimes about well you know what I have within me the Spirit of God that I can see movies are read about these great things of David and things like that those mighty men you realize the new birth that you have is the same God inside of you that they had outside of them because they were not capable of having him inside you not come yet Oh wonderful no wonder no wonder a little small button you remember that brother branham said just a Christian to be a Christian and it's like in your heart because it which is the soul he said when God comes in gives you an uber he said it's not just a little button no I'm foot no no listen to what he's saying see the growth development of a Christian watch what I'm saying on the way I said these virtues now listen to the point listen these virtues are in the soul but they are made manifest out through your spirit but they're a part of you and your soul the growing is in your soul not in your body and spirit I can't be explained the natural because it's growing all over right but listen a little white button he said let me refer to it like that and said it just starts growing and growing and says as it does you remember how we read he said it's pushing out all of those things that are not needful well I thought I was pure and clean I thought the Holy Ghost burn it does but that's till you come home let's don't make it so big of a movie that where was it's all gone Oh bless God if things go no if the devil is trying to come back do you believe that that he's always tempting you and drawing your way and doing it he's trying to come back and live in well you know what if it wasn't for God sealing that so he would come back though thank God that he sealed it but what is it watch the soul of man I was reading this morning with Brenham he said what is this oh he's you you they will look at it like some little square compartment inside of the heart well that's alright but just remember it's not in the heart anyway cuz the heart ain't nothing but a stuffing gizzard the heart of man is is the soul of man it's just mankind trying to express it what's alright put a little button nice eternal life well see here's we go well does that mean the rest of you is not eternal know that around said is God in you together as persons and they ain't no two persons of God so as God and you you remember how we tried to explain coming out to the the baptism of the Holy Ghost and how it burns out everything that's left within us that's right and God comes and lives but when he comes and lives he just comes into that little button he don't fill everything up and throw you away that's you and that little button is put in there is God but Aaron says eternal life as a little button oh man I could talk about eternal life if since it's your knee huh clear of a manifestation to understand what is happening within us see just get away from that fancy Park you know get away from the movie get down to where you live you know we're trying to make a movie out of your life I remember Zachary wait sit down stars named a certain actor and said he probably died when the hell was a curry didn't like that cuz he liked that feller you heat it like for a way to say there's possible for him to go to hell let's see that's just the way things are well let's don't try to make a movie let's try to be alive and be what we are and just think about it and just see what we really are the two very very fact that that sold is you the soul is not just a listen it's not just an inch square compartment that's his illustration the soul is you all right the body is you the spirit is you and without it those three you're not you it's just the difference of where God dwells he dwells in this human soul works back out through that through your spirit back into your body the people see your body reacting but they only see your body reacting and no it's what's taking place in your spirit but they don't think about that's real you what is the true desire of a Christian you want to be a Christian you want to live for God not to live for mankind but to live for God see if it wasn't for those things I just walk off this pulpit and say my life is based on one thing to try my best to get you to see the truth of the gospel if I offend you for doing that I don't mean to I don't mean to hurt nobody but I mean to tell it like it is where we have an opportunity to be able to serve God and walk in the light at we live in when he said a little button in inside of you well that's this you know that's an expression to me it just means I could say it this way inside of your soul when you're born again I will get back to this when it comes into the basis of the word faith the new birth faith then you've got to grow in grace and knowledge but you start by a little point of God coming to live inside of you and then he begins to work on you on the inside he doesn't work on your body he doesn't work on your spirit he works in the soul back out through your spirit and into the body make it in the correct order then you can see your desires you know God honors your desires he'll give you your desires even if sometimes it it may be wrong that we won't he will give us those things give honor our point of wanting something what you see that little button starts growing look at the statue of a perfect man their faith is that little button and this starts growing growing and growing and as it grows it pushes out it just keeps pushing out I don't understand how a cow eats green rice you swap me out I don't understand that but it does it in that body some way it transfers that and makes it work Oh wonderful now think of what I'm trying to say God I'm trying to get to that point of coming down just a little to where we can take a little point and then wait okay now listen you're when you have eternal life your soul it just is eternal as it will ever be you don't get eternal I didn't get eternal I'll get any time no see that's when two people to message today oh yeah you got a little something down here but you got a lady we get up here no that's the finish of it but you know what it's the finish up what you've started at faith you think I say so much about the new birth that's where it starts at it starts at that new birth and it begins to grow just as a natural baby eats to grow a spiritual baby eats the Word of God to grow you say well brother Dale I just can't remember like you if I was asked right now if I was asked to you to stand up and me to call out your name I couldn't do it you said boy I'm just honest Tom I got two or three names out I'd forget to rest boy you're stupid no I'm dumb tip it's another word I can't remember like that I don't try to remember like that I don't try to remember the Bible like that I told you the other day you've done you've done it this morning you're quoting the Lord's Prayer if you ask me to quote it I would probably miss it I'm quoting it well you sure no no no I don't know nothing the one the part of the word I need to know I know always reach over anything get it and it'll come out right because it's what I'd well on I don't dwell on memorizing the Bible I dwell on trying to understand what it means to me that's why there's like I said what is the new birth when prophet said it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you I never had no doubt in my mind that I had to get some revelation of John 3:16 and all to be that sure that's involved in the human life but it is not the birth that's why I tried to explain it this morning that three thousand they heard a message about the Lord Jesus Christ and that he had died for them to give his life and they believed that was the birth when they believe that when they seen what he was saying and accepted that there's the birth if it was anything else it was my culture yeah they were in the upper rooms in one mind and one Accord then the Holy Ghost fell they searched we're just not looking at the Scriptures in the way that we need to look at them instead of looking to try to figure them out let's look at him to read and see what it says when Paul says your newborn baby little rock that I'm not no baby that sounds like a baby it sounded like one talking but when it comes to listening to the prophet why did the Prophet have to come we already had the Bible we already had the teachings of the scripture we already had the things that was talking about this your newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word I've heard sermons over that in the Baptist jerks good preachers preach good messages there's one in the scripture in old Aachen that's worth talking about the whole armor of God put on the whole armor of God I don't like to hear that preach to him because every brand new preacher had ever gotten the Pope here in the Baptist Church he preached on that that was his first message the armor of God new to this but this on put that home for their own you know and he never saw one said or no no one word about this being the armor of God it was just an armor you put on this you're done and he's s to do that and I still had a good way to deliver it and others had okay I didn't get along back there so that's alright no I asked the Baptist preacher one day I said how come are you teaching us they were born again when we believe when we didn't teach that I said wait a minute hey I've been with you a long time now you do teach it that away you teach those things that's just believe I said you won't even read the scripture they said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved I said your intellectual enough to know believe it means continual there's not just to believe something he said well I guess we did teach it wrong the listen Church we have in the new birth it makes us the children of God sons and daughters and I admit this much why does that you argue with God it doesn't say in the Bible that you have manifested sons and daughters so you know how that could go would I had a question about kind of a little bit knowing something I said that you know about things and I'll get nothing message but it doesn't say women and men it will always say sons of God are led by the Spirit of God but does that mean that just women are not led by I've defended that all along and you know what I've argued that point just because it don't say daughters doesn't mean they're not daughters you women are born-again Christian you are children in the body of Christ to change to be a son it's me a daughter we have two sons and a family and one daughter let's just put it for what it is two sons one daughter you'll have to change something the right of inheritance go just as well to the daughter as it goes to the Sun but in my poll and you said what do you tell me I'm talking about one thing let's don't decrease utilize ourselves but don't blow it away because we don't have an understanding a born-again Christian whether you be male or female is a part of the body of Jesus Christ in the new birth with eternal life just as eternal as the man is eternal right because that's the scripture that's where it all fits then that doesn't degrade it's just a fact of the way the Bible is written I was reading this morning against early yesterday last night where brother Branham was talking about you know your raw things are set in the Bible in a certain way but it doesn't as I said mean the way we read it it doesn't mean there's only sons in the manifestation of God just because it doesn't say daughters it's not saying that we make those things to be able to those points for our own little benefit you know the truth is the truth okay one but listen when a child was born into the family in the Old Testament and you know the story will quote just a little bit of it will quit but in the Old Testament you had what was called the adoption and that adoption was to the basis that no you'd have a child it would be given a tutor and that tutor would raise that child to the base is that it could come to a point that adoption could come into view there's that big a word wait license if I can farm this whenever I even answer bar whatever it is okay this is signet or a sign or a time that you've reached supposed to be the onion adulthood all right and I admit that they didn't have adoption for the doubters but were they left out of it no they stayed in the house they did shows that the daughter had to have a head so she stays in her home until she marries and when she marries her husband comes her head that's all it's so and it's just things in there that you know we need to get away from those I said movie versions and get out into the truth all right and thinking about it a child I mean are you gonna take that child and it's gonna raise up and then you get up in life and after a while you decide you don't want the child no more so either disinherited or or throw it out or whatever then you say I'll just cut you off no it's the child those back back there they had to have cygnets and signs you got two example of it I said example code is not totally true we've got the example of Jacob where he got the coat of many colors from his father you know you can use that as the examples of adoption really brother branham is the only one that I ever knowed of cuz I don't remember it when it was coming down of anybody talking about the Old Testament with the word adoption I thought it was a New Testament word brother Ron said it came through from the Old Testament all right and he said that child born in the family he said it's a child the day that's born it's a child he's full inherit and listen full inheritance as a child pulling hurt this is a child you can't take away from them that ride of being a member of that family cause he's born into that family now the inheritance coming on up is the growth development yes the Lord Jesus Christ but a random tells you over and over be glad to give them then one that God had opted his own child because remember one thing in the natural you got it stages of development like within the spiritual God don't adopt the devil of children you ain't gonna adopt to you if you ain't born again you're gonna get born again first are you ain't gonna be in line to be adopted so if you ever want to think about adoption worry about getting born again make sure that that's settled and right then you can think about inheritance cuz he brother branham will say he said you're born again he said that don't give you no inheritance he's not saying that you don't have the inheritance of being in the family he's not saying the child from the time it's born up to the word that it's coming to that position that it's not a child no it is a child and it's a full inheritance as a child but it's not inheritance as an adopted child it's a different thing to come into being and see we denomination you remember we never talked about adoptions and times they said I new messages heard of read description I could read where Paul said were adopted I'm new in the Baptist Church about the adoption to the point of the in grass day the wild olive tree being engrafted I was scratched sure you don't go out here then graph Oh bad apple tree into a good apple tree and expect to get a good apples you gonna get bad apples you take the good Apple and engrafted it in to the roots of that tree to where they did can produce and bring forth but you know eventually it'll die away because it's natural somewhere it'll break down notice dis the story adoption is a story told of biblical terminologies of how that a child is born into the family and didn't child comes to adoption position now listen he gives us the tutor the baptism of the Holy Ghost is your tutor gives you the new birth that's your tutor it's it's like the man that has the child you don't give the the tutor to the child when it's brand new baby come on just get sensible your thinking when the child comes going up in age enough to be able to answer a little bit ain't got no age limit to determine I know you don't take a newborn baby and hand it over to the tutor now leave it with the momma be sensible then one day when that child grows up enough theirs will call it the age of accountability is whatever you gonna call then it can be given a tutor now I don't give the Holy Ghost to a baby of a natural baby you come to the age of accountability then you're concerned about that part then he can bring you into the family okay now listen you're a son when you're born when you're born again that makes you itch of God with eternal life just as eternal as you ever will be the adoption doesn't go into giving you eternal life it goes into giving you a thora T's and things brings you to a position the word of growth development can come into view all right but around says we call it adoption he said calling the Old Testament when that man had a child he said he gave him a tutor he brought him up to a place to where that he could be trusted then he adopted him into the family and said now your name is just as good as the father that was a natural story I know him carnal I'm sorry annoys their minds but I tried to Jacob had him any sons toyou never out of twelve sons check him okay we got a number way well now Reuben was the first well now if the story is correct Reuben when he reached the age that it could be done he was adopted into the family coming all the way down finally you get to Jacob come in forth with a brain although sure you get to Joseph and Joseph gets a coat of many colors it's a show did his father loved him they showed he'd come to a position that he loved him he was the son of his old age he only had one natural brother-in-law Joseph and Benjamin see we look at something we think well this is the story the story has to be broken down the Ruby and all of those brothers they got adopted into their family the year comes a special one which the hostess because he loved him he was a child of his old age and I said the honored him or he made him a coat of many colors we can use that as adoption but all the others were adopted too you said what do you get I'm getting to one thing we take the natural story we can't use the natural story as a natural thing we have to bring it up into a spiritual understanding and then you say hey Joseph he got the coat of many colors he was adopted but don't mean it the rest of them wouldn't adopt it because they were the natural children of Jacob and that out of a right come on you call it adoption but just remember when you get born again you are a child of God that's why we're reading Romans let's read that I didn't necessarily give him that's a week if they can get to Romans 8 we need to pick that up I didn't give it back to him that order I didn't know what you way to go if you get to Roman's 8:14 or as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God okay now listen to your scripture for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God if you're born again you're led by the Spirit of God that's what makes you a son of God right then what for you have not received the spirit of bondage in there to fear but you have received this the spirit of adoption in other words you're born to baby that's not your full stage of adoption that's the the earnest of your inheritance the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God listen and it's children then heirs look what the new birth gives you to be a child of God look what it gives you heirs of God which is eternal life Jesus never come to give us eternal life he come to bring us to eternal life eternal life is with the father Jesus had to give his life to release that for it to come back yes the Brethren said he said Jesus never never gave you an inheritance the father is what it gives you the inheritance they get the story correctly and the children then heirs heirs of God you mean we are yeah because when our children were born into our family and made them heirs your children is born into your family their heirs if you think this thing ain't right you go to an adoption agency and find out what adoption me you're gonna learn a lot more than you think I'll try to tell you about the dots into the vases you know an enriched 'red could ain't gonna do it and then work they could deny and of course he's their daughter and sent her out but they can never deny Thomas Abbey okay every grace is a natural born child Thomas as an adopted child has more rights legally by the law there's a natural born child that's how much God thinks about adoption it's brought into our government you know the adoption was really if you chase it well back and I knew this in the Baptist er the adoption was really back in the Romans days it was inherited over into the religious side of Israel coming from the natural world they picked it up from the natural world the people that were around them it was not a biblical handwritten you go to do this you go do that you adopt that's why you don't find the word adopts in the Old Testament I'm saying this I'm just I don't I don't remember the word adoption ever being held as I don't know what I'm gonna stand corrected now but I'm just saying I know it's not much but it's not an old Old Testament word because it can't be understood because how would you explain Jacob with 12 children and the only having the adoption of one child no we get adoption with each one see that's what I'm saying go to the go to it in stay with what God has given to you and me the opportunity for you and I to understand where we're leaving in what's going on if children and heirs heirs of God then what and joint heirs with Christ now if that's correct the new birth makes you a child of God just like Jesus was a child of God in her - all things equal in all thing that's something I miss how much happy should we be come look he explains it and joiners were trying yeah he explains it to make sure you don't misunderstand if so be that we suffer with him in other words if we get within us this the soul of Almighty God in the form of the baptism of the whole those were just as much Joan ours as Christ and that's why it said if so be that we suffer with him it means if if you are a child of God you're a joint heir but you've already got this part up here heirs heirs of God he turn allows you remember wage keeps praying that out in the sealed book kind of word that Jesus inherited something by coming into the world you know that the flesh the body the flesh of the Lord Jesus Christ was not eternal it had to be made eternal and by the in made eternal he an inherited he inherited eternal life in the body that's the only way the you and I will ever come to the position of a change of these bodies as to be heirs with Jesus Christ he never died to give us an inherited he died to bring us to it our inheritance is eternal life with God before the foundation in the world they Church what a wonderful thing it has to be the children of God but what a wonderful thing it is to understand it that'll never come to change the Bible he didn't change any I would say this is wrong here we need to put this here that slowly he made a few Corrections but those Corrections were were wrong just a point of interest as a point when he would say this should have been the lie instead of a lie that's just the point that they the interpreters miss that positive point that if she would have been as deal I instead of just a lie dirt listen to be the children of God that's what I'm telling you okay that's what I was trying to bring out what I've tried to bring out device few messages that I wonderful thank God would come down and give his life to where he could relinquish you know release the life that was within him then it could come back into you and I without that we can't be the children of God they were adopted in right come we were not natural born the Jew then listen we'll get back to it if we don't listen the adoption Paul said pertained to Israel see they were the children of God and the adoption arrived returns to Israel but they rejected that right they done is who was it which won him back her he saw sold his birthright that's what Israel done they sold their birthright their birthright was the adoption now listen it even says unto them belong the Oracles which is Oracle's is is the Word of God the Bible that's the Oracles of God that's what it means when it said Oracle's that's this is the Oracles of God it's garden in letter form and see it belongs to Israel but they turned it down and got turning it down as Jacob did back there I mean as Esau did he saw could never even though he sought it with tears he could never get that birthright back then you call o Jacob he was a shyster well I am too when it comes to this gospel I'm a shyster you know what I'm fixing to say most of you we used to go to Jeffersonville learn to 68 long right in there and we go up higher and they'd have they print a book for each meeting well they print 500 books they'd be a thousand people I've stood in line at the Tabernacle for four hours while the family went to get us a motel got us something to eat and come back and I eat standing in line waiting to get in and that's after the prophets done go home cuz I wanted to ride to get done but also wanted something else you remember me telling you they started to front with them books they have them boxes and they'd hand them out in the Deacons with pipes of mountain people and they price of it like here there's five people they give five books and they would place them down the house I would just go down through there like I was looking for a Pew you know or seat they're going along you know and I'd be doing it no brother Carly he'd reach down you know who one of the big reach down and get a pack of books and hand over to somebody else when he did I just say thank you you know we just walk right back up to the front like I was gonna pie somehow reach out I'm gonna walk to the back and and I was gonna pass them out to the ones that went with us we never went to a service that we didn't get a book that I was there I'm a shyster I'll do anything to get the gospel could I know what it means I'm enjoying it but what will it be when we get over yonder enjoying the throne before the glasses see what it'd be like to be the children of God if you're a child of God you have eternal life a confession is not a possession with a real possession of a born-again believer that soul is just as eternal as it'll ever be and it's just as eternal as got it caught it is God God joins into us making that soul that we are eternal adoption goes on into then as the children becoming air in add optional for the brother branham we'll get to it with the Lord Jesus on the River Jordan it says this is my beloved son and then one police tutorial typing the new birth to you and I went over at about the 17th chapter words in Matthew where it comes over to where it says he appeared you know angels and I thought he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased as well your ye him he had reached his adoption he had been adopted into the family that's what it means to you and uh he went on the Calvary and his body was changed as I said he inherited by giving his life he inherited eternal life in the body he was eternal life in soul and spirit because he was God but his body was not eternal and had to be made eternal but when it did he inherited it and by an hurt and that body got me and you with it because remember he was standing down her on the River Jordan and he said this is my beloved son then one pleased to dwell he said now I've accepted him perforation and said he'll accept you right there on the River Jordan that was proved who he was he didn't become God on the River Jordan he was born God but he became then the ability to die and give me eternal life he became me I mean came to us that we might become him come on musician think on these times of what it means to be a child of God what a wonderful opportunity to be the children of Almighty God to be born in a family I've always told you if they come to me today I've been a Dale for 79 years and that come to me today and Obie said use the Jones I said you're a real daddy here that's it forget it my real daddy was Sam Dale I don't want no Jones well yeah but if you'll be a Jones we'll give you me in the daughter that you know you heard me say this before and you think I'm lying but come on try it they'd offer me millions of dollars to accept the fact that my daddy sound there wouldn't my daddy house a Jones I don't want it cuz why because I know what a daylily is I've been a Dale I know what it is to be one I don't have to prop up and be a jones act like one I'm me all the way around I've always been that way I'm just me I'm sorry as a minister at all things I've failed and everything in the world trying to get you to see Jesus Christ that's all my goal that's my daddy I didn't get to know my real father he passed when I was about four have no remembrance of him but one day I found my real father and I not changed my name to get it so when we don't need to change my name now to get something else and just what I am a child of God being heirs with God with eternal life being joint heirs with Jesus Christ to make me a child of God just he was a child I mean through he never got around to preaching all nicely on the Godhead so hold on to it when he zags we'll start back over because you realize that man it was standing on earth he's my brother that man standing on earth was no God God came in that man to live that's why he's my Savior he's my brother that was the only way that life could be released that I could become a child was for him to do the Kinsmen part to give me his own life but he had inherited it first that's why we haven't had to change the body because I got two quotes I know laying on the - maybe one we've been around said what is that he said it will be at the first resurrection when his adoption completed at the first resurrection cause you and I've got to be a part of the first resurrection we don't go the second resurrection goes to a place is called a white throne judgment first resurrection there is no judgment so which one do you want to be you want to be a child by the first resurrection a born-again Christian didn't accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and let him come and live in you you know what I just don't understand I said Paul do you believe Jesus was Almighty God do you believe that he come and lived in this world and died for you and me didn't accept that and say thank you Lord for giving that to me you mean it's that simple yes because then he can do something about it now if you won't do it he keep doing about it you can't make you accept eternal life do you make it available and make it available the Lord Jesus is the only one that went through death burial resurrection eternity ascension and then returning back in the baptism of the Holy Ghost thinking all these things while we go go ahead let Stan Thank You long pause let me be here right
