[0:05] we all begin that together
[0:08] watch your son come by and rejoice and
[0:10] be glad that we did have a savior
[0:13] if you don't know him today

[0:22] in the holy ghost
[0:23] william b

[0:32] her nails in
[0:35] my savior's
[0:37] hands and his feet
[0:56] me
[0:59] but i believe
[1:02] it happened
[1:04] just like
[1:05] the bible said
[1:08] that a lonely man named jesus
[1:12] healed the sick
[1:14] and raised the dead
[1:16] caused the lame
[1:18] to walk
[1:22] to talk
[1:24] and he called
[1:27] the blind
[1:28] to see
[1:32] i wasn't there
[1:34] but through faith i
[1:36] still believed

[1:43] when
[1:45] they laid
[1:47] him in
[1:49] the tomb
[1:51] and sealed it with a stone
[1:56] i wasn't there
[1:59] that morning
[2:01] when mary
[2:02] came running
[2:04] and said
[2:06] the lord
[2:08] was gone
[2:16] just like
[2:18] the bible said
[2:20] that a lonely man named jesus
[2:24] healed the sick
[2:25] and raised again
[2:27] causing lame
[2:30] to walk
[2:32] the dungeon
[2:43] i wasn't there
[2:45] but through faith i
[2:47] still believed
[2:51] me
[2:52] change my heart

[23:50] now come on not just a few kids and all
[23:53] everybody come up even to the future
[23:55] back there that's trying to
[23:57] we was laughing yesterday there's one of
[23:59] them he's trying to impress his future
[24:02] father-in-law or something and
[24:05] he's trying to get by without having to
[24:06] give too many goats for a diary but
[24:09] every how you say those words but we're
[24:11] glad to have all of you here and you
[24:13] just come and gather around
[24:15] bring them in

[24:27] sides cause it'll take
[24:30] bring the little ones to
[24:33] jesus
[24:35] amen
[24:37] we don't believe in infant baptisms
[24:39] that's what a lot of people believe and
[24:41] they got their ideas
[24:42] but we believe that it's just like the
[24:45] lord jesus done you know they brought
[24:46] their little children to him and he
[24:49] blessed them
[24:50] well then that's one thing that we
[24:52] believe in doing we believe in blessing
[24:54] them and believing in putting them under
[24:57] the blood of jesus christ
[24:59] and that way then you know we can
[25:03] not have to be worried we can depend on
[25:05] him to to take care of everything with
[25:08] the child and and everything will be all
[25:10] right okay
[25:11] so we come to that point and we have
[25:13] like i said
[25:14] we have the we call them here we're kind
[25:17] of funny southern we call them in-laws
[25:18] and outlaws
[25:20] you know
[25:21] i mean that's my mother's saying and her
[25:23] saying was not right we think
[25:26] she counted the kids to be the outlaws
[25:31] all right and the daughter-in-laws and
[25:33] son-in-laws to be the
[25:35] the good ones that was just her way of
[25:37] doing it but we are
[25:39] certainly glad to be here and do this
[25:42] let's just have a word of prayer before

[31:09] resurrection you know this was the first
[31:11] day of the week that they came and said
[31:14] verse 11 said but mary stood without it
[31:16] the separation weeping
[31:18] and as she wept she stooped down and
[31:20] looked into the supplementer
[31:22] and see if two angels in white sitting
[31:24] the one at the head and
[31:26] the other at the feet where the body of
[31:28] jesus had laid and they say unto her
[31:31] woman why are we pushed out
[31:32] she saith unto them because they have
[31:35] taken away my lord
[31:37] and i know not where they have laid him
[31:40] and when she had thus
[31:42] said
[31:43] she turned herself back
[31:45] and saw jesus standing in you not that
[31:48] it was jesus
[31:50] remember he's turned back to be a young
[31:52] man
[31:53] he wasn't standing there with a bloody
[31:55] robe
[31:57] right he wouldn't the resurrection is
[31:59] about what he'd done for you and i but
[32:01] that's what he'd done for us
[32:03] he wasn't standing there with a bloody
[32:04] robe on with scars all over
[32:07] the only thing he had left was the
[32:09] nails in his hands
[32:11] to where we could remember that so just
[32:13] remember that part
[32:16] and knew not it was jesus jesus saith
[32:18] unto her woman why we forced out
[32:21] whom seeketh doubt she's supposing him
[32:23] to be the gardener saith unto him
[32:26] sir if thou have borne him hence tell me
[32:29] where thou has laid him and i will take
[32:31] him away
[32:32] jesus says unto her mary
[32:35] she turned herself and saith
[32:37] unto him
[32:38] rabboni which is to say master
[32:42] jesus saith unto her
[32:44] touch me not for i have not yet ascended
[32:47] to my father
[32:48] but go to my brethren and say unto them
[32:51] now listen to this
[32:53] i ascend unto my father and your father
[32:57] to my god and your god
[33:00] mary magdalene came and told the
[33:01] disciples that she had seen the lord and
[33:04] that he had spoken these things unto her
[33:07] you may be seated the lord add his
[33:09] blessing to the reading of the word
[33:12] now we don't have to worry today
[33:15] you know
[33:17] because we're not speaking
[33:19] we are speaking to people who
[33:21] know this message and know what we
[33:23] believe so we're not you know the
[33:24] families know
[33:26] of the things that we believe in the you
[33:28] know and have been following the message
[33:30] themselves and we appreciate that
[33:34] but you know
[33:37] we're in a world in a time when
[33:40] there'll be a lot of services held today
[33:42] around the world
[33:43] and a lot of beautiful sermons and
[33:46] things will be
[33:47] done and
[33:48] in all
[33:49] and we just you know we
[33:51] we
[33:52] appreciate all of that
[33:54] and there'll be a lot of things said
[33:55] about
[33:56] the resurrection
[33:58] and said about because of this and
[34:00] because of that and this happened and
[34:02] that happened and
[34:03] great descriptions will be made and
[34:05] churches are putting on all kind of
[34:07] programs to show you know what
[34:10] is is what they believe and that's all
[34:13] well and good
[34:14] and uh the churches will be filled with
[34:16] great uh beautiful flowers and and
[34:20] things to you know talk about a
[34:22] resurrection
[34:23] and all like that
[34:24] and there'll be many people in church
[34:26] today that won't be back in church the
[34:28] rest of the year
[34:29] but at least they're there today so
[34:31] that's that's good on that you know to
[34:33] do it uh
[34:35] and you know
[34:36] and i appreciate all that i i'm one that
[34:39] really believes in
[34:42] us
[34:42] you know being the christians to show
[34:45] what we are
[34:46] but i'm kind of i'm a little different
[34:50] a lot of people as i said will approach
[34:52] the resurrections and the things and
[34:54] i've just never been a
[34:56] type of preacher to preach a sermon
[34:58] about
[34:59] you know whatever the event is i'm not
[35:02] that away i'm always
[35:04] you know in in this take whatever i get
[35:08] and i preach from that you know but we
[35:11] we have more visitors with us today that
[35:13] you know that are
[35:15] we're not of the uh the family and
[35:18] dedicating of the baby now genie over
[35:20] here and good to see her and we have
[35:21] some a couple of brothers up here we're
[35:23] glad to see you
[35:24] and uh you know just make yourself at
[35:26] home you come back we won't have a
[35:28] service this evening but you come back
[35:30] again you won't be welcomed
[35:33] that's not worth saying anything
[35:35] you come one time you get welcome it
[35:36] comes second time you don't get welcomed
[35:38] no because you just become a part of us
[35:40] we don't have anything to join up with
[35:43] uh i've been in dale for 74 years and
[35:46] they never did ask me to join the family
[35:48] matter of fact they probably tried to
[35:49] put me out of it but you know that's all
[35:51] right
[35:53] but i want to just read a scripture and
[35:55] take a little thought
[35:56] and talk for a little bit to you about
[35:58] what's on my heart of of the things of
[36:01] where we've been related in what we've
[36:02] been speaking on
[36:04] and bringing it through the scriptures
[36:06] so go ahead brothers and pull up malachi
[36:07] 3. i love this scripture
[36:10] as we read it and you know
[36:14] it says something that's very impressive
[36:16] to me
[36:18] that you'll see in a minute will relate
[36:20] to the resurrection
[36:22] because if
[36:24] i'm a firm believer if this part of the
[36:26] scripture is true
[36:29] this part of the scripture is true
[36:32] you know
[36:32] i don't believe that god comes this way
[36:35] and then he comes different over here i
[36:38] don't believe in a changing god i
[36:40] believe a god that is unchanging
[36:42] in all of his nature his ways and his
[36:45] doing
[36:46] and in doing that then you know we can
[36:48] depend on it and i love this scripture
[36:50] so watch what it says
[36:52] it says for i am the lord
[36:55] now notice
[36:57] capital lord
[37:00] means a lot to me because that's the way
[37:02] that i preach and and try to help you to
[37:04] understand that when you see the lower
[37:07] cases and the upper cases in the bible
[37:09] you have a great understanding if you'll
[37:11] follow it that way
[37:13] because one can be lord here on earth
[37:15] the other is the god of glory all right
[37:18] but just think about it now watch what
[37:20] he says
[37:21] look look at what he's talking about the
[37:23] kind of god that we believe in
[37:26] he said for i am the lord i change not
[37:32] all right
[37:33] now mankind has always
[37:36] tried their best to change god
[37:39] right
[37:40] try to make him fit
[37:42] what they are
[37:45] their ways their concept
[37:47] or whatever you know are doing but he he
[37:50] says and notice now this is malachi
[37:52] which is malachi is the last chapter of
[37:54] the old testament all right so as it
[37:56] winds up he says
[37:58] i am the lord i change not now well i
[38:01] love that next part of the verse
[38:03] therefore you sons of jacob are not
[38:05] consumed remember old testament
[38:07] he's ending it
[38:08] the sons of jacob you know all right
[38:12] so you think about it
[38:16] if god changes what can you depend in
[38:20] you know what can you depend on
[38:22] is he like us
[38:25] you know
[38:26] we're in a day in a time of changing
[38:28] changing changing and a lot of good
[38:31] things with a lot of bad things
[38:33] you know we we came to church this
[38:35] morning and
[38:36] in good
[38:37] air conditioned cars and it rode real
[38:39] good and all but you know wasn't very
[38:42] long ago we were riding in old rough a
[38:44] models and beating up down the road and
[38:46] hoping we was going to get there
[38:47] you know
[38:48] you know but times changes but you know
[38:51] god doesn't change
[38:54] now that's wonderful
[38:56] that he doesn't change
[38:59] right see if we can depend on that and
[39:01] anchor that down in our thoughts
[39:04] then you know it says that the sons of
[39:06] jacob therefore are not consumed
[39:08] do you realize if god changes what's
[39:11] that saying
[39:14] if he changes
[39:15] there's a possibility of you and i being
[39:17] consumed
[39:19] we don't have no hopes
[39:21] if he changes
[39:24] but if he don't change
[39:26] if we can find his ways
[39:29] and we can find in the scripture what it
[39:31] declares about him then we can
[39:35] at least have hopes of not being
[39:37] consumed or destroyed
[39:39] you know done away with
[39:41] all right
[39:41] we can depend on that and we can we can
[39:44] do it
[39:44] but you notice that it said it's the
[39:46] capital lord
[39:49] that comes from the greek word and i'm
[39:50] not a scholar i just read a little
[39:53] but it comes from the word elohim which
[39:55] means a self-existing one
[39:58] now that self-existing one
[40:03] he never changes
[40:06] all right
[40:07] now you've heard the prophet make this
[40:09] statement many times
[40:11] if god ever does one does something
[40:14] one time
[40:16] he has to keep doing it the same
[40:19] because if not see he's changing
[40:21] all right see and if he saved one person
[40:25] by the blood faith in the blood in the
[40:27] old testament he had to save everybody
[40:29] faith in the blood
[40:31] he doesn't have an old testament
[40:32] salvation
[40:34] and a new testament one
[40:36] now he changes his form
[40:38] and the way he does things
[40:41] may go on into different and it does the
[40:43] old testament you know they were the
[40:45] people of god back there but jesus
[40:47] christ had not come and died so they
[40:50] could not have the eternal life
[40:52] dwelling within them in their soul that
[40:55] you and i can because that would that
[40:58] was the old testament form but it's not
[41:00] a changing of gods
[41:02] you know
[41:03] it's the same god
[41:05] it's the way he's dealing and what he's
[41:07] dealing with all right so then now the
[41:10] old testament winds up saying
[41:14] that he's the lord
[41:16] now we don't believe in trinitarianism i
[41:18] mean if you do that's your choice but
[41:21] i've just just
[41:22] you know i've been around too long i was
[41:24] telling them yesterday they said how
[41:25] long i've been preaching i said 45 years
[41:28] well after 45 years i want to
[41:31] be able to tell you what i believe you
[41:34] know
[41:34] i've had a long time to practice it
[41:37] and to learn about it and i believe in
[41:39] one true and living god
[41:42] all right and then that one true and
[41:44] living god as the he doesn't change now
[41:48] see if you say oh i believe in a trinity
[41:50] all right then look what you've got
[41:52] you've got the possibility of him
[41:54] changing from one person to another
[41:56] person to another person
[42:00] well i don't believe it that way dover
[42:02] the dale i i just believe it's god in
[42:03] three persons
[42:05] well now you're right back to the old
[42:06] trinitarian concept or thought
[42:09] you're just deceiving in your words
[42:12] because according to the webster's
[42:13] dictionary a person is a personality
[42:16] personality is an individual individual
[42:18] is a person
[42:19] so if you've got three persons in god
[42:23] look what you've got who's the oldest
[42:27] you know who created
[42:28] who come on brother i mean i'm sorry i'm
[42:32] southern i'm country
[42:34] as cornbread it can be i guess
[42:36] but i'm just plain
[42:38] at least you not deceive what i'm
[42:40] talking about you can at least say well
[42:42] i heard him say it that's what he
[42:44] believes all right see i believe the old
[42:46] testament declares one true and living
[42:48] god
[42:50] the first commandment is what
[42:52] the old oliver the lord not god is one
[42:55] all right
[42:56] see then he can't come up and have a
[42:58] different god in the new testament
[43:00] because he'd be changing
[43:02] all right
[43:03] see then as it ends in the old testament
[43:07] that i'm god and i change not
[43:10] all right see then we can make a depend
[43:13] you know depend upon
[43:15] the fact of saying the old testament
[43:17] declares
[43:19] the great eternal god
[43:22] to be won
[43:23] all right
[43:24] now we have a lot of people in the world
[43:26] today who try to come up with different
[43:28] words
[43:29] of yahweh jehovah etc
[43:32] uh
[43:34] what his issues whatever others
[43:37] from the old testament forms that you
[43:40] know they want to try to make a fancy
[43:41] statement or
[43:43] make you think they know something by
[43:45] telling you all about it but
[43:47] i'm just
[43:49] plain old country boy you know
[43:51] i
[43:52] i just believe that i'm a father
[43:56] i'm a son
[43:58] and i'm a human being
[44:02] i'm a pastor of a church
[44:04] i
[44:05] retired from general
[44:06] motors i have many many titles
[44:11] but only have one name
[44:14] right
[44:16] see my name being samuel i just have
[44:18] that one name i don't have
[44:21] now my wife though
[44:24] she does a lot of times she called me
[44:25] daddy you know cause we're all that but
[44:28] but see i'm not her daddy
[44:32] to her i'm her husband all right
[44:35] to my children i'm their father
[44:38] to the grandchildren i'm their
[44:40] grandfather the great-grandchildren see
[44:42] i have many many titles to me
[44:44] but i still just have one name
[44:46] well they've all developed here so
[44:48] everybody here at the church you know
[44:49] they they don't even say brother dale
[44:51] most of the time they call me poppy
[44:53] because that's what i am it's just to
[44:55] everybody it doesn't make no difference
[44:57] because you know and we one little boy
[44:59] we were having a testimony meeting one
[45:01] night
[45:02] and
[45:02] you know this little little black black
[45:04] boy he got up and he said i want
[45:07] i want to thank
[45:10] poppy for letting me call him poppy
[45:14] well he meant it
[45:17] he meant it and he knew that i mean it
[45:19] too
[45:20] uh you know but now get what i'm saying
[45:22] now
[45:23] the old testament then
[45:25] doesn't declare
[45:27] one form of one god or some way
[45:29] in the new testament another
[45:33] it has to declare the same
[45:36] and that way we can depend on it and we
[45:38] can surely believe then as i said i'm
[45:41] ought about because talking about a
[45:42] resurrection
[45:44] all right now i'm like this
[45:47] if that old testament god
[45:49] was not the god that raised in the new
[45:51] testament what have you got a new
[45:53] testament
[45:55] right
[45:56] you've got another god you've got
[45:57] another being you've got something else
[45:59] to deal with and you're trying to
[46:00] satisfy both of them
[46:02] and you don't know how to handle it
[46:05] but if we believe that the jehovah the
[46:07] old
[46:08] is jesus of the jew
[46:11] his name was never pronounced back there
[46:13] not saying that the word jesus was never
[46:15] used no
[46:17] because they used it
[46:19] but remember
[46:22] he said well he was jehovah but remember
[46:24] he said during the scripture he said by
[46:26] my name jehovah
[46:28] was i never known
[46:31] i quoted that to the jehovah witness
[46:33] people one day you know kind of shocked
[46:35] him i said
[46:36] he said by his name jehovah he's never
[46:38] known because jehovah's not a name
[46:41] it's jvhv or the different ways of
[46:44] bringing it and in doing it they could
[46:47] not pronounce it because it had no
[46:49] vowels or what you call in it you know
[46:52] to make it come out so they pronounced
[46:54] it jehovah which means like father with
[46:57] his family
[46:59] all right and there was a time that he
[47:01] was those things
[47:03] but times changes people but it don't
[47:05] change god
[47:07] right now
[47:09] that old testament god
[47:11] when he came over here he said
[47:14] standing on earth one day jesus said
[47:17] unless you believe
[47:19] that i am he
[47:22] you'll die in your sins
[47:25] now who's the he
[47:27] that he was speaking of
[47:29] right
[47:30] see the bible don't declare one god this
[47:32] away and another god that way that's
[47:34] man's concepts and
[47:36] ideas it declares to god to be the same
[47:40] all right and it required then that
[47:43] you know that he would have to come into
[47:45] the world
[47:47] and we got that old concept that
[47:49] there it was before the world you know
[47:51] and all and the father son and holy
[47:53] ghost was up there and
[47:55] and you know
[47:56] the father looks around and says who's
[47:58] going to go pay the price we we've got
[48:00] sin so the son steps up and said let me
[48:02] go daddy you
[48:04] know
[48:06] well that's a good thought
[48:13] but now
[48:15] suppose that
[48:17] you were standing in that situation
[48:21] and there you was and your son was
[48:23] standing there and one of you is going
[48:25] to have to die
[48:29] right
[48:30] you get the point
[48:32] you know one's gonna have to die
[48:34] you say goodbye son
[48:36] that's not too good of a dad right
[48:38] that's right
[48:40] would there be any choice in your mind
[48:43] would there be any thoughts about you
[48:45] or to say well okay you go boy
[48:49] no see that's what we think and we don't
[48:50] realize the confusion we get into the
[48:53] trinitarian thought
[48:55] that god sent his son
[48:59] sure we read scriptures but
[49:01] scriptures are deceiving
[49:03] i can read you one scripture that says
[49:05] judas went and hung himself
[49:08] right i can read you another and said
[49:10] you go do likewise
[49:13] now i quoted you the scripture
[49:18] but see there's something wrong with you
[49:20] you've got a god that changes
[49:22] i'm talking about it god that does not
[49:24] change and as that old testament ended
[49:28] it ended if i asked most people today
[49:30] you know
[49:31] in the religious realm you ask them and
[49:33] say where's the first book of the new
[49:35] testament
[49:36] and they'll turn to matthew
[49:40] that's not the new testament
[49:42] the law was still in existence while
[49:44] jesus christ was alive
[49:49] the first book of the new testament is
[49:50] the book of acts
[49:53] right come on because that's where god
[49:56] came back into the people to prove the
[49:58] resurrection had taken place
[50:02] he proved it by coming and living in the
[50:04] people
[50:05] the same god
[50:07] there was just no way that old testament
[50:10] form of god could be in the basis of
[50:13] giving
[50:14] life to people
[50:16] like we needed it
[50:17] so he had to come into flesh
[50:20] the bible said in him dwell up the
[50:21] fullness of the godhead bodily
[50:24] john 1 1 what in the beginning was the
[50:26] word word is with god and the word was
[50:27] god
[50:28] and the word verse 14 was made flesh and
[50:30] dwelt among us
[50:31] and we beheld him as the only begotten
[50:33] of the father what
[50:36] god hebrews 10 5 what did it say a body
[50:40] thou has prepared me
[50:42] see that old testament people lived
[50:44] their lives and things and brought forth
[50:46] god into a way that he could finally
[50:49] step on earth into a human body
[50:53] and dwell here with us
[50:55] in that human body
[50:56] see then that was the one that would
[50:58] come over
[51:00] and be able to give his life
[51:03] nobody else couldn't do it there's no
[51:05] man i don't care how much you think you
[51:06] could do there's no man could die the
[51:08] way he died
[51:11] if that wasn't god we're the worst
[51:12] deceived people in the world because
[51:14] there's no way that man could do what he
[51:16] went through
[51:17] and still keep his sanity and keep his
[51:20] point till all he had to do was just say
[51:23] end it
[51:25] stop it that's all he had to say
[51:29] he didn't have to say just move his hand
[51:32] the bible said a legion of angels
[51:35] would come to his aid
[51:38] it didn't take but one wormwood to
[51:39] destroy the world with water so what
[51:41] would you need with thousands of them
[51:43] you understand what i'm getting at
[51:46] i'm talking about that god there
[51:49] had to be the very god that would come
[51:51] into the new testament and live in the
[51:54] in the world with us
[51:56] and then he could say unless you believe
[51:57] that i am he
[52:02] you'll die in your sins
[52:04] all right i believe that's who he was
[52:06] helped you
[52:07] see
[52:08] see you can't have a god of the old
[52:09] testament and the god of the new
[52:12] and turn out to be the way that we
[52:14] believe it or in point
[52:16] all right so if the old testament ended
[52:19] with
[52:20] declaring
[52:22] you know
[52:24] that i'm god and i changed not
[52:27] you know i am the lord and i change not
[52:29] then we get over the book of revelations
[52:31] which would be the final book written in
[52:32] the new testament and he declares there
[52:35] he says i'm the alpha omega the
[52:37] beginning and the end
[52:39] right
[52:40] it would have to be the same god
[52:43] living
[52:45] or else we've changed somewhere
[52:48] all right now i love this scripture so
[52:50] pull it up hebrews 13 8 i love that
[52:54] if you really just looked at the
[52:55] scripture
[52:56] just look at it and read it
[52:58] and always say you know we're not making
[53:00] jokes or making fun of nobody
[53:02] but you know these glasses belong to me
[53:05] uh
[53:06] you know
[53:08] well i used to read by somebody else's
[53:10] glasses
[53:12] you know what i mean when i was in the
[53:14] baptist i had baptist classes
[53:17] right
[53:19] because for some reason then words
[53:20] changed according to what i was reading
[53:22] through
[53:23] how about you
[53:25] but then one day you know i got me a
[53:26] pair of glasses of my own yeah
[53:28] i was able to read
[53:30] well
[53:31] read the bible for yourself
[53:33] look what it says
[53:35] jesus christ
[53:37] the same yesterday
[53:40] and today
[53:42] and forever
[53:45] translate that into thinking of our
[53:47] modern ways of saying jesus christ the
[53:49] same yesterday
[53:51] even today
[53:54] and even forever the word and can be
[53:56] translated and or even right
[53:59] now what about the new testament
[54:01] declaring that type of god wouldn't that
[54:02] be perfectly sitting to where he would
[54:04] be saying i'm god and i change not right
[54:08] now he's if he's hebrews 13 8 that
[54:11] doesn't mean that it started in jesus
[54:14] standing on earth
[54:16] that's the way we want to translate that
[54:18] we translate hebrews 13 8 as saying when
[54:21] he's come on earth
[54:23] that was yesterday
[54:25] you know
[54:26] and today and forever
[54:29] no
[54:32] in simple language if he was yesterday
[54:35] that was
[54:36] the beginning
[54:39] and then all the way through would be
[54:41] now
[54:42] and the ending up he would still be the
[54:44] same
[54:46] when you get to heaven what are you
[54:47] going to see
[54:49] you know if you're a trinitarian what
[54:50] are you going to have you're going to
[54:51] have one sitting on the throne and
[54:52] you're going to have a halo of light
[54:54] floating around over this way and you're
[54:55] going to have some kind of dove that
[54:56] they try to explain and all and then
[54:59] you're going to have a father sitting
[55:00] over here this old looking guy a young
[55:02] guy
[55:03] you got it all confused to me
[55:05] i'm just that's beyond my thinking
[55:08] jesus said unless you believe that i am
[55:10] he
[55:13] philip one day said show us the father
[55:14] that it suffice or satisfy us what did
[55:17] he say
[55:18] he said philip have i been so long with
[55:21] you
[55:22] and you didn't know me
[55:24] he said if you've seen me
[55:27] right
[55:28] he said you've seen the father
[55:31] why because god was living in that flesh
[55:39] or else he was lying you know i mean
[55:42] come on
[55:43] he said what is it now
[55:46] if he's the lord and he changes not then
[55:48] that same lord would have to be the one
[55:50] that would be saying
[55:51] the same yesterday amen
[55:54] old testament
[55:56] today when he was living on earth
[55:58] and forever he will always be the same
[56:02] and he'll never change
[56:04] we're not going to get up to heaven and
[56:05] find out we're looking around trying to
[56:06] find jesus why because you're going to
[56:08] see jesus and know who that is
[56:11] right amen
[56:13] i'm a firm believer in a world of
[56:15] brothers asking some questions yesterday
[56:16] about the millennium i'm a firm believer
[56:19] in in being human
[56:24] i mean these musicians they got it on me
[56:26] i can't play
[56:28] well we got up to heaven there wouldn't
[56:29] be no thing as passing out instruments
[56:31] to play
[56:32] right you know what i mean i couldn't
[56:34] play anyway i just said give it to
[56:35] somebody else but everybody thinks we're
[56:37] gonna sit on the cloud float around play
[56:39] harps all day long
[56:42] now i'm sorry that'd be boring to me
[56:45] i think we're going to have a good time
[56:47] we're going to be able to fellowship
[56:48] we're going to be able to talk about
[56:50] this world and how we lived and how that
[56:52] the brothers flew from california
[56:56] when come down from new jersey just to
[56:58] get to see the grandbaby
[57:02] it was dedicated to the lord
[57:05] he said well you're a funny fellow will
[57:06] you tell me what you think heaven's
[57:07] going to be
[57:09] right i mean even the old ending didn't
[57:10] believe in god and the way we talk about
[57:12] it he had a happy hunting ground
[57:16] he had a place to go to
[57:18] i want to be human don't you
[57:21] it'd be wonderful
[57:23] we won't have to eat but we can eat if
[57:26] we want to
[57:29] right
[57:30] you don't have to worry about all the
[57:32] things of the world
[57:34] there won't be nobody
[57:37] hurting anybody there they won't be all
[57:39] those things
[57:41] be a beautiful day and i'm looking
[57:42] forward to that right to have a
[57:44] wonderful time and what about you know i
[57:46] can sit down and talk to you for a
[57:47] million years
[57:50] and just be
[57:52] a split second
[57:54] yeah that's right of earthly time
[57:57] you know it'll be a wonderful day that's
[57:59] the kind i believe but you see if he's
[58:01] if he's hebrews 13 8
[58:05] all right then we can depend on the new
[58:07] testament declaring
[58:09] him to be
[58:11] a god that does not change
[58:13] and then if we go to john 1 as we were
[58:15] quoting
[58:18] then
[58:19] in the beginning was the word
[58:22] the word was with god
[58:24] and the word was god
[58:27] you know that word created all things
[58:29] according to hebrews 1 john 1 colossians
[58:31] 1
[58:33] the word was the creator you know that
[58:35] james tells you who that creator is he
[58:38] said
[58:39] it was jesus christ
[58:42] all things were made by jesus christ
[58:45] now not made by the flesh jesus
[58:48] that was a human element that element
[58:50] had to be made eternal in the
[58:52] resurrection
[58:54] but the god that was living in there was
[58:56] the very god of glory
[59:00] see then all he done was just change his
[59:02] form
[59:04] to where we could comprehend
[59:06] and he moved over into
[59:09] a form if you want to call it or
[59:10] whatever and he began to say let there
[59:12] be
[59:13] let there be and the world came into
[59:15] being
[59:17] but that same god
[59:19] could stand on earth
[59:21] and said bring me some fish
[59:24] right
[59:25] bring me some fish you got anything to
[59:27] eat yeah we got a few pieces of bread
[59:30] and a few fishes he said bring him
[59:33] he just stood there and multiplied it
[59:35] out proving to be the same god
[59:38] amen all right
[59:41] but you know one day he really proved a
[59:42] lot of things
[59:47] we can go through because in exodus
[59:50] when moses met the burning bush
[59:53] he said go down there and tell them
[59:57] tell them that i'm sending you
[1:00:00] he said wait a minute
[1:00:02] i know and he reads it read it in there
[1:00:04] he said i know you're the god of abraham
[1:00:05] isaac and jacob
[1:00:08] moses knew that because of what he was
[1:00:09] looking at
[1:00:10] but he said i'm not going to egypt
[1:00:12] without a personal experience or
[1:00:13] something
[1:00:14] that i can be sure of myself
[1:00:17] he said what name should i say
[1:00:23] he said
[1:00:24] tell them i am
[1:00:26] that i am
[1:00:29] moses gets his sticks goes to egypt
[1:00:33] he had all he needed
[1:00:36] was something personal to himself about
[1:00:38] god
[1:00:42] you know it's amazing how that over in
[1:00:43] john 8 and 15 58 when jesus was standing
[1:00:47] there one day and talking to him about
[1:00:48] abraham he said before abraham was i am
[1:00:56] not that flesh
[1:00:58] no the flesh had a beginning
[1:01:03] but the god that was in there was
[1:01:04] speaking
[1:01:07] and i was quoting a while ago when he
[1:01:09] said philip have i been so long with you
[1:01:12] he wasn't meaning philip you see this
[1:01:13] flesh
[1:01:16] no you were talking about the one that
[1:01:18] was inside of there
[1:01:20] but see it took a death burl and a
[1:01:22] resurrection
[1:01:24] to bring forth
[1:01:26] this person that we talk about
[1:01:31] but see wherever changing has said
[1:01:34] the prophet of god said it like this one
[1:01:36] day he said
[1:01:37] man has changed
[1:01:39] the one god into three
[1:01:44] deceiving the world by their
[1:01:46] doctrines
[1:01:48] and ideas
[1:01:50] see
[1:01:53] if he is god then let's respect him as
[1:01:55] god and let's believe him as god
[1:01:58] whether he's not let's eat drink and be
[1:02:00] murray because tomorrow we die and
[1:02:01] forget the whole thing
[1:02:05] but we
[1:02:07] see that he changes maybe his form that
[1:02:09] he does because that's in colossians
[1:02:12] he said he was in the form of god
[1:02:14] that word form is like in morphe the
[1:02:16] prophet says changing from one form to
[1:02:18] another so like i said about my wife i'm
[1:02:21] i'm her husband the kids i'm their daddy
[1:02:23] the grandkids i'm grandpa see
[1:02:26] i've got many forms and god has done
[1:02:28] that through time to reveal himself to
[1:02:31] mankind
[1:02:34] but that's what i want to end the whole
[1:02:35] talk with today of thinking about
[1:02:39] the greatest time
[1:02:41] if i ask you
[1:02:44] if i ask you today what would be
[1:02:46] your thought of the greatest
[1:02:49] uh time event
[1:02:52] or whatever took place
[1:02:55] you know the flood
[1:02:57] crossing the red seas
[1:02:59] the the whatever
[1:03:01] you know
[1:03:03] the water turned to wine the different
[1:03:04] things what would you say is the
[1:03:06] greatest of all
[1:03:08] to prove
[1:03:11] that
[1:03:12] malachi is right when he said i changed
[1:03:14] not
[1:03:16] and hebrews is right
[1:03:18] when he says i'm the same yesterday
[1:03:20] today and forever
[1:03:21] revelation ends it up saying that i am
[1:03:23] the alpha and omega the beginning and
[1:03:26] the
[1:03:28] ending what would be the time of life
[1:03:31] that you would pick
[1:03:34] sure there had to be a time when a baby
[1:03:36] was born
[1:03:39] that's good
[1:03:42] sure we believe that that baby was
[1:03:44] emmanuel god with us we believe that
[1:03:48] but you know it
[1:03:50] when he was born he couldn't die for my
[1:03:52] sins
[1:03:53] are you listening
[1:03:54] when he was three years old he couldn't
[1:03:56] die for my sins
[1:03:58] when he was 12 talking to the
[1:04:00] to the
[1:04:01] lawyers of scribes affairs he couldn't
[1:04:03] die for my sins
[1:04:06] even when he started out in his ministry
[1:04:10] he could not die for my sins at that
[1:04:12] time because he had not been brought to
[1:04:14] the place yet
[1:04:17] but one day he came to a place and he
[1:04:19] walked into a garden
[1:04:23] and he said lord he was a human being
[1:04:25] you know the man outside
[1:04:27] he said if it's possible let this cup
[1:04:29] pass from me
[1:04:31] but he said but nevertheless
[1:04:35] i do thy will
[1:04:36] he was yielding himself to the one that
[1:04:38] was inside of him
[1:04:41] he said when you do that well don't you
[1:04:42] talk to the one inside of you
[1:04:46] brother hans used to say the only time
[1:04:48] he carried on an intelligent
[1:04:49] conversation when he was talking to
[1:04:51] himself
[1:04:55] that's a thought
[1:04:57] you don't ever talk to yourself
[1:05:02] come on i've even said seth come on
[1:05:04] straighten up
[1:05:06] you know
[1:05:07] hey
[1:05:08] cut that out you know
[1:05:12] but you see he was
[1:05:14] submitting himself
[1:05:18] and when he died on a cross many good
[1:05:20] men have died i've witnessed that in and
[1:05:21] they've had it in gainesville just the
[1:05:23] other day but i witnessed that on good
[1:05:25] friday in
[1:05:26] in the philippines
[1:05:28] when a man has been on the cross 14
[1:05:30] years in a row there
[1:05:32] and they actually put the nails to his
[1:05:34] hands they were real thin small like
[1:05:36] this but they actually nailed him to the
[1:05:38] cross and for 14 or some years his
[1:05:40] presence i guess still doing it he would
[1:05:42] they would put him on the cross
[1:05:45] there's been many a good people died
[1:05:49] many good stories you could tell in the
[1:05:50] war days of how that some would just run
[1:05:53] and jump over the top of a hand grenade
[1:05:56] or
[1:05:57] something to try to save their people
[1:06:00] there's been many many people have died
[1:06:04] but there's never been but one
[1:06:06] that said destroy this body
[1:06:10] and i'll raise it up
[1:06:13] never been but one could do that
[1:06:15] so he's got to be that same god that
[1:06:18] change is not
[1:06:20] all right then he says
[1:06:23] go ahead
[1:06:25] go ahead
[1:06:28] put me on a cross
[1:06:30] i could stop the whole time it's what he
[1:06:31] told uh pilate wouldn't he he said the
[1:06:34] only power you have is the power that my
[1:06:36] father gives you
[1:06:38] you know
[1:06:39] i could call 12 legions of angels
[1:06:42] you know
[1:06:43] but yet he willingly went to that cross
[1:06:46] and he died
[1:06:47] to give his life
[1:06:49] to you and i could have eternal life
[1:06:54] see then to me that was the proof of his
[1:06:56] messiahship
[1:06:57] because we know the messiah in the bible
[1:06:59] is promised
[1:07:00] right
[1:07:02] pronounced through the old testament you
[1:07:03] know that
[1:07:04] a virgin shall conceive bring forth a
[1:07:06] son it was promised
[1:07:08] right
[1:07:09] all right
[1:07:12] but you see he had to be more than just
[1:07:17] say
[1:07:20] a body
[1:07:22] he had to prove his messiahship
[1:07:24] he said well the dead was raised the
[1:07:25] sick was healed all okay yeah that's
[1:07:28] right and we believe the same god still
[1:07:30] does the same today
[1:07:33] but when he hung on that tree he knew
[1:07:39] that he had the ability to walk off of
[1:07:40] there
[1:07:43] his life's statement was what
[1:07:46] john behold your mother
[1:07:49] in other words take her take care of her
[1:07:52] you know talking about his mother
[1:07:54] fleshly speaking because it wouldn't we
[1:07:56] know she wasn't his mother
[1:07:58] he always called her woman
[1:08:01] because
[1:08:02] she was only an incubator we're in the
[1:08:04] day when they've got test tube babies
[1:08:05] and things you know that they they can
[1:08:07] take an egg out of this one and a sperm
[1:08:09] out of this one put them together in a
[1:08:10] tube and put them into this one and
[1:08:13] i'm going to relate it even as far as
[1:08:14] where it looks
[1:08:15] but you can have a child
[1:08:18] but you see church
[1:08:20] all that's well and good to talk about a
[1:08:22] baby and talk about a savior and talk
[1:08:24] about a person who could do all the
[1:08:26] things he could do in his life but when
[1:08:28] he went to that cross
[1:08:31] that to me is the greatest proof
[1:08:34] that he was
[1:08:36] the jehovah the old
[1:08:38] that he changed not
[1:08:41] what about knowing in your life
[1:08:44] what about knowing he knew in his life
[1:08:48] that he was going to have to die on a
[1:08:49] tree
[1:08:51] he knew the horrible things he was gonna
[1:08:52] have to go through
[1:08:55] he knew it
[1:08:56] wouldn't that be like sitting on death
[1:08:58] row for about five years and then going
[1:08:59] through all the police of court you know
[1:09:01] i'd rather go ahead and pull the switch
[1:09:03] because it bothered me the whole five
[1:09:05] years and you know
[1:09:07] but listen
[1:09:09] he proved who he was when he raised
[1:09:13] all right
[1:09:14] when he raised from the dead he proved
[1:09:16] who he
[1:09:18] was that's right because he said you
[1:09:20] destroy this body i'll raise it up
[1:09:24] he proved
[1:09:26] that he was the unchangeable god amen
[1:09:29] when you see church we have the
[1:09:30] opportunity
[1:09:32] to be proof of his resurrection
[1:09:35] right
[1:09:36] if hebrews 13 is right 13 8 is right
[1:09:38] then we have the opportunity today
[1:09:42] to prove that his resurrection
[1:09:46] did take place
[1:09:48] you know how
[1:09:51] because we can just doubt ourselves
[1:09:54] and come let him come and live
[1:09:57] and then we can show the world the god
[1:09:59] we believe
[1:10:04] it's all right to argue doctrines
[1:10:06] right
[1:10:08] but arguing doctrines has never settled
[1:10:10] anything right
[1:10:12] right
[1:10:15] but when you come to the basis you say
[1:10:19] listen
[1:10:21] he made the statement in his
[1:10:23] resurrection
[1:10:24] he said i go to my father and your
[1:10:27] father
[1:10:30] he didn't have any problems relating
[1:10:32] the believer
[1:10:34] to his family because that's what he
[1:10:35] come for
[1:10:36] and he said i go to my god
[1:10:39] and your god
[1:10:41] you know we have the same father
[1:10:44] you know we have the same god
[1:10:46] then he hasn't changed
[1:10:50] right
[1:10:51] see i i know we're dna human beings and
[1:10:54] i know everybody's different and they
[1:10:55] can run that back and chase you all the
[1:10:57] way back to the garden with their dna
[1:10:59] abilities but you know i believe every
[1:11:01] born-again believer
[1:11:02] has the same dna
[1:11:05] i didn't get a blood transfusion as we
[1:11:07] sing that song through my blood runs
[1:11:09] this and you know and all that no
[1:11:12] that's just songs
[1:11:14] there's there's no such thing
[1:11:16] i didn't get a blood transfusion today i
[1:11:18] got born again
[1:11:20] i got a god to come and live in my soul
[1:11:23] to make my soul eternal
[1:11:25] to give me eternal life and all he
[1:11:27] expects out of me is just
[1:11:30] i don't have to do anything that's what
[1:11:31] everybody thinks they think you got to
[1:11:33] give up so much to be a christian
[1:11:35] what do you got to give up
[1:11:37] drugs
[1:11:40] alcohol smoking
[1:11:42] carousings
[1:11:46] when you know that's a bunch of garbage
[1:11:47] to start with
[1:11:49] it may look like sin in beautiful for a
[1:11:50] time but
[1:11:51] the next morning you got a headache
[1:11:56] guys used to when we were kids growing
[1:11:57] up you know they say man i got so drunk
[1:11:59] yesterday i didn't even know what i'd
[1:12:01] done i said you're a stupid idiot
[1:12:06] i didn't care i said i know what i'd
[1:12:08] done yesterday
[1:12:12] see if all that stuff ought to be what
[1:12:13] is it
[1:12:15] but to even be
[1:12:17] even to be saved from that
[1:12:20] which is a good thing alcoholics
[1:12:21] anonymous is a great group
[1:12:24] but they can't get you born again
[1:12:27] right
[1:12:29] but you see if that same life that he
[1:12:31] said
[1:12:33] the life paul said that i now live in
[1:12:35] the flesh
[1:12:36] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:12:41] you know the way that i know that god
[1:12:43] doesn't change
[1:12:47] now we read and we see on the side of
[1:12:48] roads you know god's not dead because i
[1:12:51] talked to him this morning
[1:12:52] people talk to totem poles
[1:12:55] right
[1:12:57] people talk to totem poles they claim
[1:12:59] totem poles fall talk back because they
[1:13:01] hear voices or something
[1:13:04] is that the only way you can say that
[1:13:06] god lives is because you talk to him
[1:13:07] this morning
[1:13:11] well that's good but that's not all to
[1:13:13] me
[1:13:17] you see if that same god ain't living in
[1:13:19] you then the resurrection don't mean
[1:13:20] anything to you
[1:13:26] it doesn't mean a thing
[1:13:28] but if i can say the same god
[1:13:30] that was there is living in my heart
[1:13:35] that he's hebrews 13 8.
[1:13:39] that we were talking about the things
[1:13:40] the other day and had the testimonies
[1:13:42] about some of it
[1:13:44] in this little group of people that
[1:13:46] you're sitting here looking at
[1:13:48] we've seen five or six times that the
[1:13:50] dead has been raised
[1:13:53] we've seen healings of all forms and
[1:13:55] signs
[1:13:57] that we do not credit to ourselves
[1:14:00] but credit to almighty god
[1:14:03] right that's right
[1:14:05] we've seen all forms
[1:14:07] rain call for and it would come rain
[1:14:09] took away when the divorce of a person
[1:14:11] that would say it
[1:14:13] we've seen god live that's why i believe
[1:14:14] hebrews 13 8 to be right that's why i
[1:14:17] believe he doesn't change because he's
[1:14:18] still doing what he was doing back there
[1:14:21] now i'm not going to serve a god that
[1:14:22] can't help me
[1:14:24] come on i'll get me a totem pole and
[1:14:26] i'll rub it a while
[1:14:28] right it'll be no different
[1:14:32] and if it's just because i talked to him
[1:14:34] no
[1:14:36] i want him to talk back
[1:14:39] well brother dale have you ever heard
[1:14:41] audible voices no
[1:14:42] but i've sure heard a lot of inward
[1:14:44] voices and a lot of times he had to tell
[1:14:46] me why don't you straighten yourself up
[1:14:49] right you know
[1:14:51] you say oh no if i hear the voice of god
[1:14:53] i know cause it's sweet and humble and
[1:14:56] oh no you could defuse you're right in
[1:14:58] the trap of the devil
[1:15:01] a lot of times god tells you sit down
[1:15:03] shut up and behave yourself
[1:15:06] quit acting like a baby and grow up
[1:15:10] oh no that ain't god that was the devil
[1:15:13] what kind of god you got
[1:15:15] your god changed
[1:15:18] mine didn't change
[1:15:19] i can still stand here today and say and
[1:15:22] that god standing back there in that old
[1:15:24] testament
[1:15:25] he said i shall have no other gods
[1:15:27] before me
[1:15:29] you're not to worship idols you're not
[1:15:31] to do this
[1:15:32] thou shalt not commit adultery i shall
[1:15:34] not lie thou shalt not steal unless you
[1:15:36] honor i still believe that today
[1:15:38] but you know what i believe it in a
[1:15:39] higher order
[1:15:41] why because that god has come and lived
[1:15:48] into our hearts and lives
[1:15:51] the greatest
[1:15:52] proof of the resurrection
[1:15:55] is god living in you
[1:16:03] is there any hard thing to
[1:16:04] do you know
[1:16:08] i mean is it a hard thing to serve god
[1:16:13] you know
[1:16:16] i mean if it wasn't nothing but just the
[1:16:18] material
[1:16:19] things come on musicians
[1:16:21] if it wasn't nothing but material things
[1:16:23] look where america
[1:16:25] is at
[1:16:29] in my lifetime of 74 years
[1:16:32] we went from a horse and buggy
[1:16:36] to astronauts and beyond that
[1:16:39] in my lifetime
[1:16:45] when
[1:16:47] we kids
[1:16:49] i was the
[1:16:50] youngest of 13.
[1:16:53] i had three brothers older well i got a
[1:16:54] lot of hand-me-downs you know what
[1:16:58] and a lot of my patches had patches on
[1:17:00] the patches
[1:17:02] you know
[1:17:04] not saying that's wrong we were just
[1:17:06] poor old country people because that's
[1:17:08] what we all were
[1:17:12] we walked to school we
[1:17:14] worked we'd done everything we could do
[1:17:16] for ourselves to try to make a living
[1:17:18] these kids out here i was seven years
[1:17:20] old playing a mule out in the field all
[1:17:22] day long
[1:17:25] because we had to make a living
[1:17:27] but that was all of america that was all
[1:17:30] of the south
[1:17:31] and the things poor
[1:17:40] we throw off on slaveries and things
[1:17:41] like that yeah and i don't believe in it
[1:17:43] i believe we're all human beings and
[1:17:45] we're right
[1:17:46] but we never had any racial problems
[1:17:48] around here we were all just trying to
[1:17:50] make a living
[1:17:52] you know what it didn't matter if the
[1:17:54] neighbor was black white green brown
[1:17:55] what color he was
[1:17:57] if he got sick we went and raised his
[1:17:59] crop
[1:18:03] we worked
[1:18:08] but you see during all of that look what
[1:18:09] god has multiplied in america
[1:18:12] and it's made us to the point
[1:18:14] you know
[1:18:16] until we're rich people
[1:18:19] until the foreign countries even think
[1:18:21] that money grows on trees
[1:18:27] told you about that time in jamaica and
[1:18:29] that man he said
[1:18:30] is it true y'all have gold cards you
[1:18:33] know cards
[1:18:35] and i said
[1:18:36] he said this man said y'all had gold
[1:18:38] cards
[1:18:41] i
[1:18:42] you know i talked
[1:18:44] for a minute and then it hit me i said
[1:18:46] he's talking about a gold colored card
[1:18:49] that's you know a credit card
[1:18:52] i said yeah i've got one but i won't
[1:18:53] take it out because it wouldn't have it
[1:18:54] long if i took it out see
[1:18:57] and uh he said see there they've got
[1:18:59] gold carts we'll see it's still thought
[1:19:01] we had gold cards
[1:19:02] but
[1:19:05] if nothing else look what god has done
[1:19:06] for america
[1:19:09] look what god has done for you and i
[1:19:13] look where he's brought all of us to
[1:19:16] gave us the riches of the world
[1:19:21] that we can enjoy it
[1:19:23] he's been wonderful to us
[1:19:25] why wouldn't we want to serve him even
[1:19:27] for that reason
[1:19:29] if nothing else why wouldn't we not want
[1:19:30] to serve god just for the reason of the
[1:19:32] materialistic world that we live in
[1:19:34] today
[1:19:37] but we also know that that materialistic
[1:19:38] world has taken us to evil
[1:19:41] brought on every form of evil into our
[1:19:44] hands and land
[1:19:48] you see he said i'm god and i changed
[1:19:49] not amen
[1:19:53] so if you don't know him as your savior
[1:19:55] today remember that that you heard a man
[1:19:57] say one time did he believe that god
[1:19:58] didn't change
[1:20:01] and that if i can believe the same way
[1:20:04] that that first man believed for healing
[1:20:07] i can be healed
[1:20:09] if i can believe and do and follow the
[1:20:12] same that that first man followed
[1:20:17] i could be saved
[1:20:20] because these gardening changes
[1:20:25] we can depend on that can't but let's
