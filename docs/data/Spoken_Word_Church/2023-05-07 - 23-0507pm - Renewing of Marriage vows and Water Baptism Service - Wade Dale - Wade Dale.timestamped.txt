[7:18] I would not be alive

[7:33] hey man it would not be denied
[7:39] denied what
[7:40] listen
[7:43] in this day and time
[7:45] they only denied is what you do
[7:48] everything's open sales has been open
[7:50] the way the redemption's been opened the
[7:53] way to live has been open the way to do
[7:55] things has been open the way to even run
[7:58] our life is open
[7:59] and it's um an open book is as we know
[8:03] that we live in the age of the open book
[8:07] um
[8:09] there was a time when man lived in a
[8:11] closed book
[8:12] they couldn't see they looked through a
[8:14] glass Darkly even Paul
[8:15] and um he couldn't see everything
[8:19] but remember they had one consolation
[8:21] they saw Jesus they looked to the Cross
[8:23] they looked at the author and finisher
[8:25] of their faith and so do we we look to
[8:28] that we look today to
[8:31] um to the word of God As I said this
[8:33] morning there's nothing else to look to
[8:35] there's just nothing else to go to
[8:37] everything fails except the word of God
[8:40] and the prophet of God tells us there's
[8:42] every answer you need in the word of God
[8:44] every answer you need there's not
[8:46] anything you go through life where you
[8:48] can't relate back to the Bible and say
[8:50] oh that's what it's saying or that's
[8:52] what that's how to handle it or that's
[8:54] or that's what happened to whoever Abram
[8:57] um Noah Moses all the different ones
[8:59] they they lived their life and I like
[9:01] what someone said maybe brother brother
[9:04] um uh Willie they they went through
[9:06] their life and and I don't think Abraham
[9:08] went through his life and said
[9:10] they're going to conquer me they're
[9:12] going to talk about me six thousand
[9:13] years from now
[9:15] God's gonna call me the father of Faith
[9:18] No he got up and went to work did his
[9:21] job
[9:23] Noah
[9:25] sure Noah had a job Moses had a job but
[9:28] still
[9:29] they weren't they weren't sure they were
[9:31] led by God but they didn't have the
[9:33] vision to see they knew there was
[9:34] something greater coming and they were a
[9:36] part of it but they just really didn't
[9:38] know the part but you and I know every
[9:39] part they play
[9:41] and it's and it's connected to the part
[9:43] we play
[9:44] because it was given as the Bible says
[9:46] the all all the Old Testament was given
[9:48] for an example
[9:50] for us to use as examples to bring us
[9:54] closer to God
[9:55] amen you love the Lord let me get
[9:58] through with these announcements and and
[10:00] um

[13:07] them and today we're going to do our
[13:09] vowel renewal but we're going to speak a
[13:11] little bit about that just for a moment
[13:13] and bring out a few points
[13:16] um this was not done to to
[13:19] I hope you don't feel embarrassed it's
[13:21] just something we do something that Dad
[13:23] did and I said it was not too long ago
[13:25] but I think we figured out it was like
[13:27] 15 years ago
[13:28] so some of y'all were not even married
[13:30] at that time some of you are not coming
[13:32] to church here at that time but we had a
[13:33] vowel renewal everybody come up around
[13:35] the pulpit and Dad we all recited our
[13:38] vows and repeated our vows and I have a
[13:40] scripture for that too and I'll read it
[13:42] talking about doing renewal because
[13:44] that's what we're going to talk about is
[13:47] renewing our vows
[13:49] and repairing some our relationship with
[13:52] each other that helps us with our
[13:54] relationship with God
[13:56] amen
[13:57] we're still humans
[13:59] if things don't go right at home
[14:01] what happens things gonna go right at
[14:03] church
[14:05] we're humans it affects us everything
[14:07] little something affects us and I want
[14:09] us to be where we get at least we can
[14:12] chisel some of the little things out of
[14:14] the way so that we can talk to God
[14:16] better or he can talk to us better amen
[14:18] he's always there to talk to us we just
[14:20] say well we ain't got time to talk about
[14:22] that right now well you do the same
[14:24] thing with your spouse so maybe you
[14:25] ought to take some time and I'm guilty
[14:28] take the time to listen to what they got
[14:30] to say all right so let's bow our heads
[14:33] Lord thank you for this day thank you
[14:34] for the day you give us and not just a
[14:37] day of 24-hour a day not just a day
[14:39] called Sunday but this is as you told
[14:42] John this was the day of the Lord and
[14:44] it's a day that has been like no other
[14:46] day as the song says there's never been
[14:48] a day like this day Lord we've come into
[14:51] the end of time
[14:53] of the of the Gentile dispensation and
[14:56] and we're part of it and Lord we don't
[14:59] want to be left here
[15:00] we want to go home we want to as
[15:02] Revelation is 19 we want to be that wife
[15:04] that has made herself ready
[15:06] and Lord to be able to do that we're
[15:08] going to have to listen listen to you
[15:10] listen to what you've got to say in the
[15:12] word listen to what you got to say
[15:14] through our prophet and the fivefold
[15:16] ministry Lord and then not just hear it
[15:18] but not be hearers as the Bible said but
[15:20] be doers
[15:21] that will do these things that the
[15:23] scripture tells us to do father and do
[15:25] it not with not with uh not begrudgingly
[15:28] but do it with a with an honest heart as
[15:31] today we say our vows to each uh to our
[15:34] spouse Lord I I pray that as we're going
[15:37] to read that it be a renewing that it be
[15:38] a bringing back together
[15:40] of maybe certain things that's got in
[15:43] between Lord between us and you and and
[15:46] us and our spouse
[15:47] father I pray for the ones that don't
[15:49] have a a spouse yet or has one and
[15:53] they've passed on Father you're the only
[15:55] one that can give them peace you're the
[15:57] only one that can give them
[15:58] understanding there's a purpose behind
[16:01] everything you never made a mistake so
[16:04] whatever were any of us are going
[16:06] through lord it's for your honor and
[16:08] glory and we give it to you father in
[16:10] the name of Jesus Christ
[16:12] amen so let's read this real quick and
[16:14] then we'll then you can be seated
[16:16] Genesis 2 18.
[16:18] the Lord God said it's not good that a
[16:20] man should be alone all right so he's
[16:22] starting out right off the bat he's made
[16:23] everything he's made it all he's give
[16:26] he's put Genesis 2 7 he's put man in in
[16:29] a body a human body and said hey
[16:31] till the ground work on the work on the
[16:33] work on work on the Earth all right you
[16:35] take care of the earth I'll take care of
[16:37] Heaven I was lonely
[16:38] and I made you
[16:40] all right now he sees that the man is
[16:43] lonely
[16:44] so there's something inside of the man
[16:47] that's got to come out
[16:48] it's kind of funny that she came from
[16:50] his rib cage
[16:54] she was caged up inside of him
[16:57] and she had to come out and like and
[16:59] we'll say We'll look in the vowels
[17:02] um
[17:03] that
[17:04] why was it here
[17:06] why didn't he take a bone from the foot
[17:08] or a bone from her head
[17:10] we'll find out just a second and the
[17:11] Lord God said it's not good the man
[17:13] should be alone
[17:14] I will make him and help me for him
[17:17] and out of the ground the Lord formed
[17:19] every beast of the field and ever fouled
[17:20] the air in other words male and female
[17:22] and brought him unto Adam to see what
[17:24] they would call them and whatsoever Adam
[17:26] called every living creature that was
[17:28] his name and Adam gave names to all the
[17:30] cattle and foul the air beast of the
[17:32] field in other words Adam was doing some
[17:33] work he was working he wasn't just
[17:35] sitting around he was working
[17:36] and then and then Adam says well
[17:40] Lord there's a a female lion and she's
[17:44] laying there with her mate you know and
[17:46] they're just cooing to each other and
[17:48] they you know they're everything's in
[17:49] Harmony and they're and they're uh
[17:51] they're there together and
[17:54] I'm just here by myself
[17:56] there was something inside of him there
[17:58] was a desire there was a Genesis 1 26
[18:00] inside of that man that was caged up
[18:04] that needed to get out
[18:06] and that by that desire of Adam through
[18:09] the desire of Adam e comes into being
[18:11] through the desire of Jesus Christ a
[18:15] bride comes into big hey man so because
[18:18] we were caged up inside of him until
[18:20] they stuck his side all right and Adam
[18:24] gave every name but for Adam there was
[18:26] not found and helped meat
[18:28] you know brother Dale knows we know that
[18:30] that's not help mate
[18:31] he's helped meat it's a co-equal and
[18:34] remember when when we get started
[18:37] Adam and Eve were co-equal before the
[18:40] fall
[18:41] co-equal all right
[18:43] and the Lord God caused the Deep Sleep
[18:45] to fall upon Adam the first
[18:46] anesthesiologist was the Lord
[18:48] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[18:51] and closed up the flesh instead thereof
[18:54] and the rib which the Lord had taken
[18:55] from man made he a woman could you
[18:57] imagine standing there you know it you
[18:59] see a rib you see Adam and you see this
[19:01] thing opening up you see God pull a rib
[19:03] out everything closed back together and
[19:05] then he kind of sets that rib over into
[19:07] the dirt and it's standing up like this
[19:08] and all of a sudden Here Comes This
[19:10] Woman
[19:12] here comes the DNA of Adam
[19:15] inside that come on people the DNA
[19:19] of that rib made Eve but it was Adam's
[19:23] Rib
[19:25] praise God
[19:27] these types are perfect and beautiful
[19:31] and the rib which the Lord God took from
[19:33] man who made he a woman and brought her
[19:34] until the man that's why the man has
[19:37] that's why the father has to give the
[19:38] bride away
[19:41] the heavenly father brought the bride to
[19:43] the groom
[19:44] brought it to him and Adam said this is
[19:47] now bone of my bone and Flesh of My
[19:48] Flesh you shall be called woman because
[19:51] she was taken out of man what a
[19:52] revelation therefore shall a man leave
[19:55] his father and mother and shall cleave
[19:56] unto his wife and they shall be one
[19:58] flesh and they were both naked the man
[20:00] and his wife and they were not ashamed
[20:02] you may be seated in the Lord has
[20:03] blessing to the reading his word
[20:07] you see the order now they they come
[20:09] together they they come together as
[20:11] husband and wife
[20:12] and then the man is going to cleave
[20:15] to Adam and Eve are going to cleave
[20:18] together and even God by his
[20:20] foreknowledge because remember Adam's
[20:23] father was God
[20:27] amen
[20:28] so God is telling us right here he's
[20:31] telling us therefore shall a man leave
[20:34] his father and his mother so he knows
[20:36] they're going to propagate Even Adam
[20:38] knows that something's going to happen
[20:39] there's going to be fathers and mothers
[20:41] all right he's telling them what's
[20:43] coming up now they don't exactly know
[20:45] right now what's going on and they were
[20:47] both naked and man and his wife and were
[20:49] not ashamed all right
[20:51] and say something about that but you
[20:53] just be comfortable with your mate all
[20:55] right okay Titus 3-3 I want to read this
[20:59] right here real quick I was uh
[21:01] looking at it back here and I'm gonna
[21:03] read it and then we'll uh we'll continue
[21:05] on Titus 3 says for we also
[21:08] ourselves also were sometimes foolish
[21:10] disobedient deceived serving divers lust
[21:13] and Pleasures living in Malice and then
[21:15] be hateful and hating one another
[21:18] but after that the kindness and love of
[21:21] God our savior toward man appeared in
[21:24] other words after we come to the new
[21:25] birth after we come to acknowledge that
[21:27] we're that we need salvation all right
[21:29] but look not by works of righteousness
[21:32] which we have done
[21:34] but according to his Mercy he saved us
[21:39] by the washing of regeneration and the
[21:42] renewing of the Holy Ghost
[21:44] now you say well what you know why do we
[21:48] need to renew our vows
[21:51] right here is where we're going to renew
[21:53] our vows
[21:54] we got married right here
[21:57] we live our life we're going through our
[21:59] life we're learning how to be God
[22:01] hello somebody we're learning how to be
[22:03] each other husband and wife now natural
[22:06] but spiritual we're learning how to be
[22:07] God but then we come and we got right
[22:10] here and we got to renew ourselves by
[22:13] that Holy Ghost
[22:15] all right so that's what we're doing
[22:16] today we're renewing our valve but we're
[22:19] we're we're renewing ourselves listen

[22:34] of God we have to renew our vows

[22:48] oh I'm sorry complete change for the
[22:51] better
[22:52] the better
[22:54] not worse
[22:56] you went through that better or worse
[22:57] thing when you did your vows
[23:00] complete change for the better so today
[23:02] I don't want this to be an embarrassment
[23:04] I want it to be a a wonderful time if
[23:07] you don't participate that's okay if you
[23:09] can't participate that's okay but if you
[23:12] can do like sister Rachel just go all
[23:14] out get the veil back out and and uh you
[23:18] know get everything together and and
[23:20] smile and make job say will you marry me
[23:27] she probably shamed him a little bit
[23:31] yeah yes
[23:33] but he's waiting on the honeymoon no
[23:35] numbers 30.
[23:37] first two
[23:39] now here is and I don't want we're not
[23:42] one day maybe we'll talk about marriage
[23:44] and divorce and bowing about but we'll
[23:46] do it maybe a little bit later but not
[23:48] today but we have to bring why do we
[23:50] have vows
[23:52] because the prophet of God told us I
[23:54] didn't pull it up but you know as well
[23:56] as I do as many of you know the message
[23:58] of the hour brother round says the vowel
[24:00] is what marries you
[24:02] it's not the coming together it's not
[24:04] the having the Intercourse there's not
[24:06] has nothing to do with any of that it's
[24:08] the vowel The Vow is what marries you
[24:11] when you vow vow numbers 30 verse 2 if a
[24:14] man vow a vow unto the Lord or swear an
[24:17] oath to bind his soul with a bond
[24:20] he shall not break his word
[24:23] he shall do according to all that
[24:26] proceedeth out of his mouth so we need
[24:29] to be careful with our conversation
[24:32] if a woman also vowed vow into the Lord
[24:35] and bind herself by a bond being in her
[24:38] father's house in her youth now this is
[24:40] a story but I'm going to back up to in
[24:41] just a second now listen if the father
[24:44] hears her vow
[24:46] that's why a young man
[24:49] you go ask the father
[24:53] for her hand in marriage
[24:56] it's not your girlfriend coming to ask
[24:59] your daddy
[25:01] come on somebody this one listen this
[25:04] world is just so perverted that women
[25:07] are asking men to marry him now that
[25:09] ain't right
[25:10] right ain't right it ain't right by it
[25:13] biblically it's not right
[25:16] but let's go by the Bible so let's do it
[25:18] right
[25:19] if a woman found a vowel to the Lord and
[25:21] find herself by one being in her
[25:23] father's house and her youth in other
[25:24] words still living a home because
[25:26] remember until the until the girl our
[25:28] boy gets the Holy Ghost you parents are
[25:31] their Holy Ghost is that why is that
[25:32] correct a man your parents are their
[25:35] Holy Ghost all right you're the girls
[25:37] Holy Ghost and you're the boy's Holy
[25:39] Ghost until they decide that they want
[25:42] to leave or continue to stay all right
[25:44] everybody with me
[25:46] and bind herself by a bond source to vow
[25:50] you see when you when we do them when we
[25:52] do a marriage just just to give you a
[25:54] pointer here dad's always taught me this
[25:56] from years and years and years and years
[25:57] and years and years ago
[25:59] that The Vow is what marries you
[26:02] all right so when you're when you're
[26:04] counseling with with two people and you
[26:08] don't ask them what's your past and and
[26:11] how many times or you know how many
[26:12] girls or boys you've had you ask them
[26:14] one question
[26:16] have you ever betroth yourself in other
[26:19] words have you ever vowed your self to a
[26:23] man if they say no not a problem
[26:26] if he says no not a problem we can marry
[26:29] him now listen if they have a problem
[26:31] besides that that's for them to talk
[26:32] about not me we as ministers let me just
[26:36] be plain we don't get in the bedroom
[26:38] amen whatever that that's your business
[26:40] all right if you two agree that's your
[26:43] business but in this part the father can
[26:47] hear that vow and that's why you got to
[26:49] go ask the father and if the father has
[26:51] any issue with that he can stop it right
[26:54] he can stop it he can say no and he can
[26:57] tell you why I don't want to know you
[26:59] know fathers I got a grandbaby back
[27:01] there Deanna she's 14 be 15 in a few
[27:04] days
[27:06] well let's get off of that I'll kill him
[27:08] her father here her father hear The Vow
[27:12] though her bond wherewith she had bound
[27:15] her soul and her father shall hold his
[27:17] peace in other words the father says yes
[27:20] you can marry her you can marry him
[27:23] then that vowel stays
[27:25] right and by with me that thou sticks if
[27:27] the father agrees
[27:29] holds his peace says nothing in other
[27:31] words not say nothing but he says yes
[27:33] you can marry my daughter you can have
[27:35] my can I have her hand in marriage yes
[27:37] you can well that's the vow all right so
[27:40] so then you go ask the girl when I say
[27:42] when you ask the girl she's got a choice
[27:45] back and forth to vow to say yes or no
[27:47] because the girl can say no and that
[27:49] takes her away from having any part to
[27:51] do with you've got to marry
[27:54] but if you say yes
[27:56] if you say yes I'll marry you brother
[27:58] Brown said you're just as good and
[28:00] married right there as you are any other
[28:02] time it's just the law of the land gives
[28:04] us gives us the right to give them a
[28:06] piece of paper to live together legally
[28:09] all right everybody with me
[28:12] and but now if the Father scripture 5 we
[28:15] won't get into that but just for a
[28:17] moment but if the father says no
[28:20] then it stops right there
[28:22] if the father says no you can't marry my
[28:25] daughter it stopped now whatever she
[28:26] does after that is her business
[28:28] but if he says no then that's it
[28:32] now and then you can continue on there's
[28:34] some confusion in that people have but
[28:37] some say if the woman vows a vow and and
[28:40] uh the father hears it later and all
[28:43] that but let's don't let's not worry
[28:44] about that right now we're all grown up
[28:45] so we we're getting married today all
[28:47] right and her father hear her vow and
[28:50] her bond see the bond and the vowel is
[28:52] the same thing
[28:54] so wherewith she has bound her soul
[28:58] all right
[29:00] let's just be honest a lot of men and
[29:02] women get married
[29:04] in the flesh
[29:08] not in the soul they don't bind
[29:09] themselves together and say this is the
[29:11] re this is the real person I want to
[29:13] marry so my brother Brown said you need
[29:15] to have the Holy Ghost because then your
[29:17] soul will speak
[29:18] it'll be that inside God that will speak
[29:20] all right and we see train wrecks we see
[29:24] we all we've all had our conversation as
[29:26] Paul says in times past in the lust of
[29:28] the flesh we've all made mistakes which
[29:31] we should have went back and had to if
[29:32] we had the Holy Ghost it had been all
[29:34] like different
[29:35] and we wouldn't have so many scars but
[29:36] we didn't we're here to tell you don't
[29:38] do it do it this way
[29:41] do it the biblical way
[29:43] and her father shall hold his peace at
[29:45] her then all her vows shall stand
[29:49] and every bond that she's bound to in
[29:53] other words shall stand everything will
[29:56] stand if the if the father says yes
[30:00] all right father says yes you go right
[30:02] ahead You've Got His blessings what they
[30:04] call it you know you get the blessing of
[30:05] the father when you get the blessing of
[30:07] the father then you're free to marry and
[30:09] you are just as married now listen that
[30:11] doesn't give you a right to run off and
[30:12] and have the honeymoon let's have the
[30:14] marriage first let's get that done let's
[30:16] get the legal part out of the way all
[30:18] right get by with me I hope I'm not
[30:21] hurting anybody I know some of us got
[30:22] married different ways just for the
[30:23] peace this and that and the other and I
[30:25] hope you're not living together
[30:31] I hope we're cleaning up in this church
[30:34] and not not be living you know like that
[30:37] right even though well we vowed a vowel
[30:39] that was three years ago we about no you
[30:41] got a problem
[30:42] no you need to be married
[30:45] by whatever
[30:47] so Matthew 19 verse 4. everybody
[30:49] understand about the vowel so the vows
[30:51] what marriage you so when we uh the
[30:52] reason I'm telling you this is we're
[30:54] going to come up here and we're going to
[30:55] State our vows and you know what the
[30:57] vows
[30:59] what gets me more than anything you look
[31:01] at this the tits statistics
[31:04] the statistics tells you that a marriage
[31:07] only lasts about five years
[31:09] 50 of marriages are over in five years
[31:15] out there
[31:16] five years divorce five years
[31:21] some of them pay for fifty thousand
[31:23] dollar weddings in five years
[31:25] divorced
[31:27] see but that's when you put two people
[31:29] together by the flesh
[31:31] they vowed by the flesh they don't vow
[31:33] by the soul they don't vow they don't
[31:34] they don't really think about what's
[31:36] going on all right
[31:38] Matthew 19 verse 4 says they asked Jesus
[31:41] that this all this question of marriage
[31:43] has always come up it's come up in every
[31:45] generation there's been a question of
[31:47] marriage and divorce but we're just
[31:50] going to talk about marriage today
[31:51] Matthew 19 says Jesus said he answered
[31:54] the senator them have you not read
[31:56] I mean he's talking to the scribes and
[31:58] Pharisees he's saying you should know
[31:59] you should have already read this you
[32:01] should read numbers 30. you should read
[32:04] Leviticus different 20-something or so
[32:06] something same thing you ought to know
[32:09] this but you're testing me because he
[32:11] knew the Bible says somewhere he knew
[32:12] they were tempting him
[32:14] because remember the question was if a
[32:16] girl if a sister dies and I mean if the
[32:19] brother dies and and she's still alive
[32:21] and he's got seven brothers and they all
[32:23] have her and they all die who she
[32:24] married if the when they come up in the
[32:26] resurrection well who cares
[32:28] he's told him he said none of them
[32:31] he said it's not like that anymore he's
[32:33] telling them there's a new there's a new
[32:35] part coming when we come to the other
[32:37] side and there's a lot to say about that
[32:40] but will not but Jesus said he answered
[32:42] and said have you not read that he which
[32:44] made them at the beginning made them
[32:45] male and female
[32:47] that's a lost revelation
[32:49] in this day and time
[32:51] that walk group or whatever you want to
[32:53] call it
[32:56] made them male and female if you decide
[32:59] I guess is what they're saying
[33:01] see how messed up this perverted this
[33:03] world is
[33:04] and he said for this cause shall a manly
[33:07] father and mother in Cleveland to his
[33:08] wife if they twain shall be one flesh
[33:10] wherefore there are no more Twain but
[33:13] one flesh what therefore God hath joined
[33:17] together let no man
[33:19] put asunder
[33:21] Hebrews 13 4 tells us real plain
[33:25] marriage is Honorable and all in the bed
[33:26] undefiled but whoremongers and
[33:28] adulterers God will judge let your
[33:30] conversation be without Covetous and be
[33:32] content with such things as you have
[33:36] for he saith for he has said I will
[33:39] never leave thee
[33:40] nor forsake thee
[33:43] Revelations 19 7 and we'll get ready in
[33:46] just a minute and we'll we'll do our vow
[33:48] renewals Revelations 19 7 said let us be
[33:51] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[33:53] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[33:55] and his wife
[33:57] hath made herself ready
[33:59] remember we get married here
[34:01] we get married here
[34:03] then we renew our vows right there
[34:06] then we go into this this listen folks
[34:09] listen
[34:10] this right here is the Son of God
[34:12] Revelation right
[34:13] this is the son of man Revelation right
[34:15] the son of man Revelation is listen they
[34:19] were married and given in marriage here
[34:21] come on
[34:23] yeah married giving him marriage but
[34:24] this right here the son of man he can
[34:27] get married
[34:30] we were inside of him we were not a
[34:32] separate entity we were him
[34:34] she is him that's why brother Brown came
[34:37] to that headstone said she is him
[34:39] she
[34:41] is not a part of him she is him right
[34:44] that's what Adam and he
[34:46] was literally him
[34:50] but since the fall remember it got
[34:51] separated but hey whatever that was
[34:53] before has got to come back together
[34:56] and it's a it's a it's a portion listen
[34:59] it's a portion well we got people like
[35:02] Mom and Dad 65 years
[35:05] 55 years married
[35:09] 65 years
[35:11] wow
[35:14] that's a long time
[35:21] I thank God because I'm 63 that they've
[35:23] been married 65 years
[35:26] but you know what they'll tell you real
[35:28] quick that it hadn't been easy
[35:31] it's been fun
[35:34] June and I 44 years coming up this year
[35:36] so I I don't know if some of y'all been
[35:38] married
[35:40] more sister Trudy how long have you been
[35:42] married hun
[35:44] it's not a trick question
[35:46] you don't know it's been 60 years though
[35:49] probably at least okay so you and Mom
[35:51] and him are 60 and then then it trickles
[35:54] down to just a few years
[35:58] but we all have our conversation that we
[36:00] we say well we made it through this and
[36:02] we made it through this and this is how
[36:04] we made it through this well see you
[36:06] that's why the Bible says that the older
[36:08] can help the younger if you'll listen
[36:09] this younger generation just don't
[36:11] listen
[36:13] or some of y'all not listening
[36:16] okay
[36:19] it's like you know so I told Deanna one
[36:22] time I said don't shake your head
[36:26] it's like you know we Papa went from
[36:28] five years old to 50.
[36:31] and never had no end between that you
[36:34] know we never went though you don't know
[36:35] what I'm going through yeah we do
[36:38] yeah we do in our own way we know what
[36:41] you're going through
[36:42] now you may be listen we didn't have the
[36:44] internet where everything is just
[36:45] splattered right there in front of you
[36:47] okay but we had stuff splattered there
[36:50] in front of us anyway we were able to
[36:52] find whatever we needed to find it
[36:53] didn't have to be on a computer we found
[36:55] it that brother Donnie said if we found
[36:57] it so it's the same thing same devil
[37:00] same problem same issues but listen it's
[37:02] the same God
[37:04] it's the same God that 65 years they can
[37:07] live together
[37:08] in 44 years and all the different ones
[37:10] that you can live together in harmony
[37:15] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[37:17] honor to him for the marriage of the
[37:18] Lamb has come and his wife hath made
[37:21] herself ready
[37:22] and to her was granted that she should
[37:24] be a raid in fine linen clean and white
[37:26] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[37:28] of the Saints and he said unto me right
[37:31] blessed are they which are called unto
[37:33] the marriage supper of the Lamb and he
[37:36] saith unto me these are the true sayings
[37:40] of God
[37:42] that's what God said we don't have to uh
[37:44] we don't have to it's not James Dobson
[37:47] not not William Branham
[37:51] hey Scott's what he says what God Said
[37:54] this is what God told us
[37:57] and he told us
[37:58] to renew ourselves by the Holy Ghost
[38:02] and I believe today now now I'll I'll
[38:05] tell you one thing about me and Jim we
[38:07] didn't have the Holy Ghost when we got
[38:08] married
[38:09] okay
[38:11] but some of you did
[38:12] and that's wonderful but listen as we
[38:14] come up here today
[38:17] I think we all got the Holy Ghost
[38:19] so you're coming up here and not for a
[38:22] different purpose but you're coming up
[38:23] here a different way with a different
[38:24] with a different view of what's going on
[38:28] like Rachel and and Joe you know they
[38:31] she says you he's got to ask me you
[38:33] gotta ask me you gotta ask me well
[38:35] he finally did
[38:37] he didn't get a black eye for it but
[38:42] would you marry your spouse again
[38:45] would you
[38:48] because I I read your scripture was to
[38:50] be content
[38:52] be content in what you have
[38:55] be content with such things as you have
[38:58] amen everybody does not have a husband
[39:02] or a wife that makes them 250 000 a year
[39:06] okay
[39:09] 50 Maybe
[39:11] but be content you know what if you put
[39:14] the whole the whole thing is Brother
[39:15] John is like you said you got to plug
[39:17] God into the whole thing
[39:18] if you don't plug God into the whole
[39:20] thing it doesn't matter if you make 250
[39:22] 000 a year I promise you you will
[39:25] Swindle it away or whatever they call it
[39:28] you will make it disappear hey man right
[39:31] so we're we're now as we're coming up
[39:34] here in just a few minutes we're coming
[39:36] up here as Christians
[39:38] and as Christians we're telling our our
[39:40] spouse we love you
[39:42] and we continue to want to love you more
[39:45] now
[39:47] I love Jim more now than I did then
[39:51] if you don't then you got a problem
[39:53] if you don't know her more now than you
[39:56] did then we got a problem but there's a
[39:58] communication problem somewhere really
[40:00] big communication problem
[40:03] but we are now the wife so the wife and
[40:06] husband are coming up and they're going
[40:08] to look at each other and
[40:10] and we're going to say our vows
[40:12] just as Lauren looked at McKenzie
[40:14] yesterday and and he meant what he said
[40:17] he really meant what he said is she was
[40:19] just she just she just was an ooze of
[40:22] Joy just Joy just went everywhere out of
[40:24] her you know she was just so happy and
[40:27] uh because she was getting married to
[40:28] the man that she loved
[40:31] and I know each one of us the same way
[40:35] put God first
[40:38] I always put God first
[40:40] because what happened in the Garden of
[40:41] Eden
[40:43] Eve didn't put God first
[40:46] she didn't even put Adam first
[40:48] she put herself first
[40:50] and you see how that ruined the human
[40:51] race and it's going to ruin your
[40:53] marriage if you put I mean me uh come on
[40:56] sorry
[40:59] I'll clap myself
[41:04] and do we do that I mean listen we're
[41:06] going to do our biles right now
[41:09] do we really and June and I don't do it
[41:11] all the time do we really hold hands and
[41:15] look at each other like brother Brown
[41:16] said get over the dewfold anybody know
[41:18] what a dewfold is
[41:20] no mama does so the older ones knows
[41:23] what to do it it's almost it's kind of
[41:25] like an ottoman
[41:26] kind of like an ottoman something you
[41:28] put your feet on or something that's in
[41:29] the middle of the middle of the room
[41:31] like a coffee table but it's got padding
[41:33] on it all right so do it for someone
[41:35] tend to sit on brother random what's out
[41:36] remember he said we'd all as a family
[41:38] get around the dufo when he was getting
[41:40] ready to go overseas or make a decision
[41:43] and he had his wife there and they would
[41:44] what pray
[41:47] we don't always do that Junior and I
[41:49] don't always do that and we need to do
[41:50] that
[41:51] you need to pray about everything you do

[44:32] shot turn and look this way let him take
[44:34] a picture or whoever else wants to take
[44:36] a picture take a picture and then we
[44:39] will turn this way
[44:43] all right thank you all right turn back
[44:47] around and get with your mate
[44:52] everybody all right here we go
[44:56] we're gathered here today in the sight
[44:58] of God to join together this man and
[45:00] this woman in the holy matrimony
[45:02] marriage is Honorable instituted by God
[45:05] himself and commissioned from the
[45:07] beginning
[45:09] and as I said God was lonely
[45:12] so he made Adam
[45:13] was lonely so he made Eve
[45:17] and then we know what else happened but
[45:19] from but right at that moment there was
[45:21] perfection in the Garden of Eden
[45:23] it was two people come together as one
[45:28] right and remember he took it out of
[45:31] Adam's side
[45:33] he did not take it from Adam's head
[45:35] because she's not to be his head
[45:38] okay
[45:39] did not take the bone from Adam's foot
[45:43] because you're not to stomp on her
[45:46] she's not to be under your feet she used
[45:48] to be at your side
[45:50] right there brother Brown said fifth rib
[45:52] Down Under the heart heart's right here
[45:54] and that's where the rib was and that's
[45:56] where the rib cage was
[45:59] so we know that's why God did that so in
[46:01] Genesis 2 God instructed man to leave
[46:03] his father and mother and Cleveland to
[46:04] his wife and they shall be one flesh
[46:07] cleave means to stick together cling
[46:10] together stay close
[46:14] listen
[46:16] each one of us has had our time where we
[46:19] got mad at our spouse and didn't talk to
[46:21] him
[46:24] maybe it's just me and Jim to pray for
[46:26] us
[46:28] but but
[46:30] try to fight that
[46:33] fight it
[46:34] because you're gonna fight about it
[46:37] but fight it
[46:38] you listen you share everything with
[46:42] your spouse you should share everything
[46:45] with them no secrets everything
[46:49] right
[46:54] that's why this cleave means to stick
[46:56] together stay close this is why this
[46:58] Union should be entered in with all
[46:59] reverence seeking advice from God
[47:01] through prayer and communication with
[47:03] each other
[47:04] marriage is not a union of two bodies
[47:09] it's a union of two minds and two hearts
[47:14] through this marriage
[47:16] you will be making a commitment
[47:18] to face your disappointments
[47:21] accept each other's failures
[47:24] but also be able to realize your dreams
[47:26] and reach your goals together
[47:28] so today as we stand here before God we
[47:31] are honored to be here today as a
[47:33] witness of this bow renewal

[49:26] let's let's buy our heads just for a
[49:28] moment
[49:29] dear heavenly father
[49:31] Lord this vow renewal
[49:34] reminds me Lord of a
[49:36] of a time when when you were
[49:40] you were way back into the eternities
[49:41] and you were lonely
[49:45] and you were a father but you were also
[49:49] a husband
[49:51] you were all these many things
[49:53] and you wanted something to communicate
[49:56] with
[49:58] so through your Providence you formed
[50:00] Adam
[50:01] a part of you
[50:04] and didn't as the prophet says many
[50:06] times you didn't make another creation
[50:10] you took something from that creation
[50:14] and made Eve
[50:16] and Lord when you hung at Calvary
[50:20] you wanted a bride
[50:22] but she was inside your rib cage
[50:25] she was there in your heart
[50:28] but you had to do something to let her
[50:30] out
[50:32] so your side had to be pierced and water
[50:35] and blood came forth
[50:37] the prophet of God said that's where the
[50:39] Bride come out
[50:41] and Lord now we're standing here
[50:43] together with our bride
[50:46] as Grooms and and grooms his bride
[50:49] Lord many of us have been married a long
[50:51] time some have not
[50:53] something's been through many deep
[50:54] trials and some's not been through so
[50:56] many
[50:57] but Lord I pray that we all together
[50:59] today
[51:00] that we bind closer together
[51:03] that we respect each other
[51:05] that we love each other
[51:07] and that we put you first
[51:10] in everything we do
[51:12] and that we as a as a church family as

[51:18] this Sanctuary to vow a vow of renewal
[51:21] to Lord renew us

[51:51] Lord what a wonderful day but until that
[51:54] day we've got to go through trials

[54:12] bit different than the rest I said thank
[54:14] God I don't want to be one of them Bible
[54:15] Toten you understand what I'm talking
[54:17] about
[54:17] because y'all promise you in this
[54:19] message we've seen people that was that
[54:21] was to look like the bishop

[54:42] every one of you but I don't want to be
[54:44] somebody that y'all put up on don't ever
[54:46] put somebody on a pedestal because I'll
[54:47] promise you

[54:51] because he'll not share his glory with
[54:52] nobody
[54:53] right so this is the church family this

[56:54] if you've been here a while brother
[56:55] Dale's pretty much dedicated everybody
[56:59] so uh we want to uh
[57:02] um we want to continue that
[57:04] amen all right let's talk a minute about
[57:06] water baptism and then we'll go out
[57:08] there I know there's now four that want
[57:10] to be baptized if you want to be
[57:11] baptized what we'll do is is we'll
[57:13] finish here I've got to change clothes
[57:15] the pool is already hot and ready to go
[57:18] so we can take the cover off of it and
[57:21] it should be ready to go
[57:23] and uh
[57:24] but I want to talk to you just a minute
[57:26] about water baptism
[57:29] in Mark 1 verse 4 it says John did
[57:31] baptize in the wilderness and preach the
[57:34] baptism of repentance this was something
[57:36] new it what didn't happen in the Old
[57:37] Testament this was something new and
[57:39] John was bridging us into the New
[57:41] Testament to bring us something new
[57:44] baptism was not in the Old Testament
[57:46] it's in the New Testament but I mean you
[57:48] know John was in the Old Testament but
[57:49] he was bringing us into the new he knew
[57:52] that testator was coming to make a new
[57:55] testament
[57:56] so John did baptize in the wilderness
[57:58] and preached the baptism of repentance
[58:00] for the remission of sins
[58:02] and they went out unto him all in the
[58:04] land of Judea and they were Jerusalem
[58:06] man this was this was you know this was
[58:08] an item
[58:10] they never seen anything like this
[58:11] before Here Comes this guy walking out
[58:13] of the Wilderness with just a loincloth
[58:15] on you know and he comes goes in at nine
[58:17] comes out at 30 and he's just setting
[58:19] the world on fire you got to repent
[58:22] right they ain't heard anything like
[58:24] that before most of them had heard go to
[58:27] the temple take a lamb take this take
[58:29] that you know he said no come be
[58:33] baptized
[58:35] and they were all baptized of him in the
[58:37] River Jordan confessing their sins and
[58:39] John was clothed with camel hair and
[58:40] with girdle of a skin that was loins and
[58:42] he did eat locusts and wild honey what a
[58:45] diet
[58:46] and preach saying there cometh one
[58:48] mightier than I after me the latchet of
[58:50] whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop
[58:52] down and unloose
[58:54] I indeed have baptized you with water
[58:57] but he shall baptize you with the Holy
[59:00] Ghost
[59:02] because John couldn't do that
[59:04] only Jesus can do that
[59:06] and it came to pass in those days that
[59:08] Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and
[59:10] was baptized of John in the River Jordan
[59:13] straightway coming out of the water he
[59:14] saw the heavens open in the spirit like
[59:16] a dove
[59:18] descending upon him and there came a
[59:21] voice from Heaven saying Thou Art my
[59:22] beloved Son and whom I am well
[59:25] please
[59:27] when you get the new birth that's what
[59:29] God says to you I am pleased to dwell
[59:31] inside of you
[59:32] just like he did as our example Jesus
[59:35] didn't need the Holy Ghost
[59:37] but this is an example of an anointing
[59:39] that comes on Jesus that was visible
[59:42] John could see that
[59:44] and God told him said whatever you see
[59:46] the one the Holy Ghost come on and
[59:48] remain that's the one that's going to
[59:50] baptize you
[59:52] right not many days well you know three
[59:54] and a half years later
[59:55] he baptized his disciples
[59:58] and he didn't baptize anybody else Jesus
[1:00:00] baptized his disciples and decided he
[1:00:02] didn't baptize anybody else so Matthew
[1:00:04] 28 18 and Jesus came and spoken to them
[1:00:06] saying all power is given unto me in
[1:00:09] heaven and in Earth go ye therefore and
[1:00:11] teach All Nations baptizing them in the
[1:00:12] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:00:15] the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe
[1:00:18] all things whatsoever I have commanded
[1:00:19] you and lo I Am with You alway even unto
[1:00:22] the end of the world
[1:00:24] amen so acts 1 and 4 is being assembled
[1:00:28] with him commanded them that they should
[1:00:30] not depart from Jerusalem this is Jesus
[1:00:31] but wait for the promise of the Father
[1:00:33] which saith he listen he said promise
[1:00:38] Jesus said there is a promise coming if
[1:00:40] you do this
[1:00:41] right
[1:00:44] but wait for the promise of the Father
[1:00:45] which saith he you have heard of me for
[1:00:48] John truly baptized you with water in
[1:00:51] other words baptize you physically but
[1:00:53] you shall be baptized with a holy ghost
[1:00:55] not many days hence what a promise
[1:01:00] and when they had heard this and then it
[1:01:02] comes over and and comes to the to the
[1:01:04] upper room and and Peter and all of them
[1:01:06] are assembled 120 and Peter preaches
[1:01:09] them about a 15-minute sermon and
[1:01:10] they're pricked at their heart when they
[1:01:12] heard this they were pricked in her
[1:01:13] heart and said Peter to Peter and the
[1:01:16] rest of the Apostles men and Brethren
[1:01:17] what shall we do
[1:01:19] what's next
[1:01:21] then Peter said repent
[1:01:25] so today if you're getting re-baptized
[1:01:27] or you're getting baptized for the first
[1:01:28] time repent
[1:01:32] repent every one of you
[1:01:34] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:01:37] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:01:39] of sins and you shall receive there's
[1:01:41] your promise the gift
[1:01:43] of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto
[1:01:45] you until you children and to all that
[1:01:48] are far off even as many as the Lord Our
[1:01:50] God shall call look it and start the
[1:01:52] ball rolling
[1:01:53] start the ball rolling
[1:01:55] for the promises to you
[1:01:57] and to your children
[1:02:00] and to all that are far off
[1:02:02] Hebrews means the Lord Our God shall
[1:02:04] call do you know your kids your literal
[1:02:07] children your flesh and blood benefits
[1:02:09] by you having the Holy Ghost now that
[1:02:11] don't seem that way sometimes when
[1:02:13] they're so contrary and they go out in
[1:02:14] the world and they go do their thing of
[1:02:16] the world you're like Mom and Dad's
[1:02:18] crazy they don't know what they're
[1:02:19] saying but years later guess what
[1:02:23] they were right
[1:02:25] I want them to be my example
[1:02:28] amen
[1:02:30] you come back you know
[1:02:34] teach a child in the way it should go
[1:02:36] and what when it's older right it'll not
[1:02:38] depart from you
[1:02:40] that's a promise
[1:02:42] So This Promise is
[1:02:44] water baptism the children see it listen
[1:02:46] our kids are not dummies right they may
[1:02:50] be kids
[1:02:51] but they watch everything we do
[1:02:54] everything and sometimes they emulate
[1:02:56] the things that we do
[1:02:58] and do you want them to emulate
[1:03:00] everything you do no
[1:03:05] but there is a promise
[1:03:07] that
[1:03:09] you get baptized
[1:03:12] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:13] Ghost
[1:03:14] and you pray for your kids
[1:03:17] they receive the Holy Ghost they pray
[1:03:19] for their kids they have to West Bend
[1:03:20] since since 2000 years ago that's the
[1:03:22] way it's been
[1:03:23] it's been one praying for another
[1:03:25] you just don't get the Holy Ghost
[1:03:26] because God just pours it on top of you
[1:03:29] brother Brown said some grandma
[1:03:33] may not have been right there and said
[1:03:34] some great great grandma
[1:03:37] could have prayed for you and got on her
[1:03:39] knees and said God save all my children
[1:03:41] my grandchildren my great-grandchildren
[1:03:43] and that's what God honored was that so
[1:03:46] listen you say well I don't have any
[1:03:48] well if the time goes on you sure
[1:03:50] probably will have some kids and
[1:03:52] grandkids and great grandkids so start
[1:03:54] praying for them now
[1:03:56] as many as the Lord Our God shall call
[1:03:58] and with many other words did he testify
[1:04:00] and exhort saying save yourself
[1:04:02] from this untoward generation and that's
[1:04:04] what we're trying to do we're trying to
[1:04:06] we're trying to reconcile ourselves back
[1:04:08] to God as we were talking about this
[1:04:09] morning and that world reconcile means
[1:04:11] repair our relationship
[1:04:13] reconcile come back together
[1:04:17] you know even and let me just say this
[1:04:20] for a minute for us that our marriage
[1:04:22] that even the Bible tells us that if you
[1:04:25] can't live together that you can
[1:04:27] separate for a season anybody with me
[1:04:30] no divorce
[1:04:32] you can separate for a season and then
[1:04:34] what reconcile back together all right
[1:04:37] so you can do that maybe some you know
[1:04:39] you may need to use that
[1:04:41] brother Joe's looking for the honeymoon
[1:04:44] and June's leaving me for two days so
[1:04:47] go figure
[1:04:52] she's going to see her daddy she's
[1:04:53] leaving me for an older man
[1:04:55] then then they gladly received his word
[1:04:58] look they that gladly received his word
[1:05:01] were baptized so that their attitude is
[1:05:03] what brought them to where they were
[1:05:04] going their attitude they were gladly
[1:05:07] they received this the ones that were
[1:05:09] pricked in her heart that was three
[1:05:11] thousand can you imagine we're going to
[1:05:12] baptize four
[1:05:13] or five or six ever how many
[1:05:16] three thousand
[1:05:19] take a while but you know what if three
[1:05:22] thousand wants to be baptized I'd have
[1:05:24] to quit my job but I wouldn't care the
[1:05:25] Lord would do so I'd stand right there
[1:05:26] till the water running out of that thing
[1:05:29] see that's that's what we look they're
[1:05:32] at what was added to the kingdom was not
[1:05:35] 3 000 people
[1:05:40] Souls
[1:05:41] you say well that is people well
[1:05:45] you gotta remember those Souls were born
[1:05:48] again and added into the kingdom you can
[1:05:51] have a soul and live in this Kingdom and
[1:05:53] never get into that Kingdom so three
[1:05:56] thousand Souls were saved
[1:05:59] and they continue steadfast in the
[1:06:01] doctrine Apostles Doctrine and
[1:06:03] fellowship and breaking the bread
[1:06:04] and in prayer they had all things in
[1:06:06] other words they had it common now we
[1:06:10] know and where's nobody here that
[1:06:12] doesn't that's not in the message so we
[1:06:14] know that we baptize the name of the
[1:06:16] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:17] because that's the name that Jesus told
[1:06:20] us that was his name name of the father
[1:06:23] name of the son name of the holy spirit
[1:06:26] is the Lord Jesus Christ and that as we
[1:06:29] were talking up here you know we were
[1:06:31] reciting our vows we had called somebody
[1:06:33] else's name
[1:06:35] we called our spouse's name so we
[1:06:38] identified that Jim is mine and I'm hers
[1:06:43] she didn't say I I vow husband well
[1:06:47] that's six or eight billion people
[1:06:50] husband
[1:06:51] but when she said my name or when I said
[1:06:53] her name it it took it all down to one
[1:06:55] person
[1:06:56] so that's the same way with baptism it
[1:06:58] takes it down to one person
[1:07:00] you baptized in the only person that can
[1:07:02] save your soul
[1:07:03] ain't nobody else can save you but the
[1:07:05] Lord Jesus Christ a father can't save
[1:07:07] you a son can't save you and the Holy
[1:07:10] Ghost
[1:07:11] but you can be anointed by the Holy
[1:07:12] Ghost and die and go to hell
[1:07:14] amen
[1:07:16] right right in your spirit Realm
[1:07:19] but you can't be born again by the Lord
[1:07:21] Jesus Christ himself
[1:07:23] and take a part of him in your soul
[1:07:27] you can never be lost
[1:07:29] praise God
[1:07:30] what if that's the promise you can never
[1:07:32] be lost you you attack yourself as
[1:07:35] brother Ernie says you attach yourself
[1:07:36] to the eternal
[1:07:38] we attach ourselves to God by by not a
[1:07:40] father not a son or a title it's the
[1:07:44] very name of God
[1:07:45] which is our husband the Lord Jesus
[1:07:48] Christ that's who we're marrying let's
[1:07:49] stand to our feet
[1:07:52] if you want to be baptized uh sisters if
[1:07:54] you want to be baptized
[1:07:56] I know we have one or so yes sir
[1:08:01] yeah sure come on
[1:08:18] now listen we we don't do things wrong
[1:08:22] we follow the word of God
[1:08:24] when I took the boy and the girl that
[1:08:28] was mother and son
[1:08:29] that was not trying to find
[1:08:32] a way
[1:08:34] a Avenue a vote that wouldn't that
[1:08:38] wouldn't it now
[1:08:39] it was the fact that he wanted to be
[1:08:42] dedicated because he was not dedicated
[1:08:45] when he was three four years old
[1:08:48] he wasn't dedicated he wanted to be
[1:08:50] dedicated
[1:08:52] but everybody understand because you
[1:08:54] come up there and you you start pulling
[1:08:57] little little things you'll come back
[1:08:59] here
[1:09:01] in answer to this little thing
[1:09:03] because I tell you the truth amen the
[1:09:07] truth has been told you today and we get
[1:09:09] on the to the marriage and divorce
[1:09:13] and we can stay on it for months
[1:09:16] but yet
[1:09:18] and never run out
[1:09:19] because it is the word of God Amen and
[1:09:23] the word of God is true amen so we stay
[1:09:26] with the word of God we don't stay with
[1:09:27] man's ideas nope see someone could take
[1:09:31] what was said and that was they was
[1:09:33] doing what was they doing with the of
[1:09:37] a child no no that was long years ago
[1:09:41] that was not not in that Avenue that was
[1:09:45] just like we're fixing to do now
[1:09:48] there will be in people going to the
[1:09:51] water and being baptized
[1:09:53] you know maybe young ones or maybe old
[1:09:55] ones
[1:09:56] you're just making yourself straight
[1:09:58] amen showing what you are
[1:10:01] and we are the Bride of Jesus Christ not
[1:10:04] the father-son Holy Ghost
[1:10:07] that's out of the picture see
[1:10:10] but the Lord Jesus Christ is the word of
[1:10:12] God Amen and it is set by that as to
[1:10:16] this line of the church
[1:10:18] and it is run from that line of the
[1:10:21] church everybody understand
[1:10:23] you go and call go somewhere and tell
[1:10:26] them tell the truth
[1:10:30] because that's what happens to like this
[1:10:33] you go somewhere you tell the truth
[1:10:36] and it's okay if you don't tell the
[1:10:39] truth you cause kiss them yeah that's
[1:10:41] right
[1:10:42] so that's up to you I just wanted to
[1:10:45] make sure to get that right to where
[1:10:47] there wouldn't be no no questions about
[1:10:49] what was happening and what we were
[1:10:51] doing of the the boy and the girl or the
[1:10:54] man his sister melka and the boy you
