[30:13] also the group in ohio wanted me to tell
[30:15] you today that they have
[30:17] come up with a name for the little group
[30:19] that they're at their uh meeting there
[30:21] this morning at uh
[30:23] in uh
[30:24] brother isaac's basement some of you
[30:26] most of you saw the pictures of it
[30:28] um but they're going to be now called
[30:30] the lighthouse of refuge
[30:32] the lighthouse of refuge the reason they
[30:34] did that is is they're going to have a
[30:36] church it is a church they are watching
[30:38] us online but we are praying that
[30:40] they'll that they'll um
[30:42] uh get them a pastor or somebody will
[30:44] raise up
[30:45] uh god to raise somebody up in in that
[30:48] group
[30:49] but as for now they call us their home
[30:52] church
[30:53] and the ministry here is what they
[30:55] listen to
[30:56] and i wish that they would uh
[30:59] i wish that they would uh
[31:02] be able to tell you and you know it's
[31:04] not bragging on them but man they just
[31:06] they comment so much about the services
[31:08] and
[31:09] i wonder how many of you went back and
[31:11] listened to what services when you
[31:13] weren't here
[31:14] obviously you don't because when we make
[31:16] announcements it's like a surprise to
[31:18] you
[31:18] so that's a
[31:21] attaboy to them
[31:25] but you know what when the words me and
[31:26] brother bible talk about just a few
[31:27] minutes ago when the word of god is
[31:30] the foremost thing in your life
[31:33] and receiving that word of god and
[31:35] trying to grow up the statue of perfect
[31:36] man
[31:37] that's what will happen to you
[31:40] if you lollygag around and diddle around
[31:42] and just you know come to church and you
[31:44] don't ever pay attention and and uh you
[31:46] sleep half the time then
[31:49] it's like brother bob said one day
[31:50] you're going to wake up and the rapture
[31:51] is going to take place have already took
[31:53] place hey man brother brown said you
[31:55] know he said that still small voice will
[31:57] say
[31:58] you missed it
[32:00] don't waste our time we'll talk about
[32:02] that today about the children of israel
[32:04] but
[32:04] the lighthouse of refuge is the name of
[32:06] the church and they are they are a
[32:08] full-fledged part of our church at the

[41:17] lord but you're god almighty that
[41:19] created all things and we thank you for
[41:21] that lord it humbles us to know that
[41:23] there was a god

[41:27] you decided to need us and you put us in
[41:29] your plan

[41:41] having her surgery on her
[41:43] on her left hand
[41:46] one day this week yeah wednesday all
[41:49] right john 1 verse 1. in the beginning
[41:51] was the word words with god and the word
[41:53] was god the word was made flesh and
[41:54] dwelt among us we beheld the glory of
[41:56] the glory the only begotten of the
[41:57] father full of grace
[41:59] and truth you may be seated in the lord
[42:01] as blessing to the reading of the word
[42:03] we're going to read romans 8 verse 18.
[42:06] i was talking to brother brother mike
[42:07] oltek we were
[42:09] talking sunday afternoon and oh no
[42:11] sunday morning in the study and he said
[42:13] man i sure am enjoying that um
[42:16] son of man series he said but when i
[42:18] looked down and saw you was at part 30
[42:20] he said i was didn't want to listen to
[42:22] every one of them he said can you give
[42:23] me another
[42:25] condensed version
[42:27] so i give him a few extras because a lot
[42:28] of it's fill in and you understand what
[42:30] i mean a lot of it you have to
[42:31] background because there's people here
[42:33] that are new and and all that so
[42:35] i told him just to be patient i'd get
[42:38] finished here in just a little bit we're
[42:39] on part 31 today
[42:42] but i love the son of man i mean it's
[42:43] what we're supposed to be that's what
[42:45] we're supposed to be focused on it's
[42:46] like i'm gonna read you here in a minute
[42:47] you know
[42:52] somebody's horn's honking in the outside
[43:00] whose car is it
[43:02] can you go look and see if you don't
[43:03] mind somebody
[43:07] all right now i'll continue honking in
[43:09] here
[43:13] romans eight are we out of
[43:17] yeah i hear it now are we out of a
[43:19] screen here we don't have no
[43:22] blue skirt we got blue screen
[43:24] maybe they're working on it so romans 8
[43:26] verse 18 because i need it up for what
[43:27] we're going to do in the book of hebrews
[43:29] for i reckon that the suffering of this
[43:31] present time are not worthy to be
[43:32] compared with the glory which shall be
[43:33] revealed in us
[43:36] not in paper and pencil and trees and
[43:39] cars that are honking
[43:41] it's going to be revealed in people all
[43:43] right for the earnest expectation of the
[43:45] creature our creation
[43:47] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[43:49] sons of god
[43:51] and remember we've been talking about
[43:53] being predestinated to adoption so we've
[43:55] been predestinated to something
[43:58] there's people that have been
[43:59] predestinated to eternal life these
[44:01] people been predestinated to damnation
[44:03] but it was because of what god saw in
[44:06] his mind before the foundation of the
[44:08] world everybody all right with that all
[44:10] right
[44:12] hey i heard a lot of amens last weekend
[44:15] i don't want to bring new preachers in
[44:16] here every weekend just to get you all
[44:18] saying man
[44:20] thank you sister at least she got a
[44:23] revelation but we're predestinated to
[44:25] adoption and that's our call our call is
[44:28] to be adopted in this time not that not
[44:30] to just not to just even go up the
[44:32] statue of a perfect man and if they will
[44:35] in a few minutes we're going to pull
[44:36] that chart back up
[44:38] but let me read number one i've read
[44:39] this before but i'm going to read it
[44:40] again brother brown says teaching places
[44:42] of man positionally
[44:44] what he is and as as brother bob and
[44:46] different ones have been talking about
[44:48] you got to know where you're at
[44:50] you got to know what you're doing with
[44:52] god you can't be sure you can
[44:56] you can you need to be at rest
[44:58] but now that doesn't mean stay at home
[45:02] right you need to be at rest in what in
[45:04] your person
[45:06] your person needs your soul needs to be
[45:08] at rest but listen god never has rested
[45:12] as man says rest we think of rest as
[45:14] going sitting under a tree with our arms
[45:16] folded our legs folded kick back in a
[45:18] hammock and take a nap which sounds
[45:20] pretty good but that's not what god does
[45:23] god's moving that's why you see the
[45:24] people at the whaling mall even even the
[45:26] israelites now they know god the jews
[45:29] they know god moves so they when they're
[45:31] praying they're moving they're always
[45:33] constantly moving and so is god
[45:35] and listen
[45:37] he's not required to go back and pick us
[45:40] up
[45:42] but he does
[45:43] that's called grace
[45:45] but he's not required to and one day
[45:46] he's going to move on and we're going to
[45:48] have to move on with him because
[45:49] remember he said i'll not always strive
[45:51] with man there's a lot of things god
[45:53] tells you that when he gets done telling
[45:55] you if you don't do it
[45:57] you're in big trouble we're all in big
[45:59] trouble all right so teaching places of
[46:02] man positionally
[46:04] what he is
[46:05] now listen
[46:06] we want to know why do we come to church
[46:08] we come to church to know who we are
[46:11] you say oh brother we're bride it's
[46:13] deeper than that
[46:15] there's things that go with it
[46:18] there's things that go with that we are
[46:19] the bride of jesus christ sure but what
[46:21] is the bride supposed to do we're
[46:23] supposed to be him
[46:25] made manifest in another form called the
[46:27] bride
[46:29] so teaching positionally places what he
[46:31] is and we can never rightly be able to
[46:33] have faith
[46:35] everybody's wanting to have faith
[46:39] well here's what the prophet everybody
[46:40] believed brother brown was the prophet
[46:42] all right okay brother brown said
[46:45] you never
[46:46] rightly you can never rightly be able to
[46:49] have faith until positionally we know
[46:52] what we are
[46:53] all right we got to know what we are not
[46:56] what we're going to be we listen the
[46:58] bible tells us what we're going to be
[47:00] we're going we're the bride of jesus
[47:01] christ we're going to live in heaven
[47:03] with him we're going to be eternal
[47:04] people but there's a journey in there we
[47:06] just don't skip from one to the other
[47:09] you don't skip from kindergarten to
[47:10] college
[47:11] it doesn't happen
[47:14] all right so now let's go to number two
[47:16] and let's just read this real quick
[47:17] brother ryan says your adoption is not
[47:19] your birth so we we pulled it apart
[47:21] there's two different things
[47:22] that we're looking at here your adoption
[47:24] is not your birth your adoption is your
[47:26] placing
[47:27] you were born again and we'll look at
[47:29] this in in hebrews i was looking at a
[47:31] couple days ago and i thought man this
[47:32] is good so we're going to go through if
[47:34] you got your bible go and turn to
[47:36] hebrews chapter 2 and we'll get to that
[47:37] in just a second
[47:39] because i want you to read along with me
[47:40] besides on the screen if you don't mind
[47:43] but when you're born of the spirit of
[47:44] god you're son of god
[47:46] but you were predestinated
[47:49] but you were predestinated now here's
[47:52] what i'm trying to get you to for the
[47:54] sons of the last
[47:55] day
[47:57] everybody with me
[47:58] we were predestinated unto adoption
[48:02] and there's three stages of adoption the
[48:04] first stage is what getting born again
[48:07] the first stage is if you could pull
[48:08] that chart up please
[48:12] the first stage is the birth
[48:14] romans 8 verse 14 says for as many as
[48:16] are led by the spirit of god they are
[48:19] the sons of god
[48:21] for we have not received the spirit of
[48:22] bondage again to fear but we have
[48:24] received a spirit of adoption
[48:26] whereby we cry
[48:28] have a father so we're babies we all
[48:30] begin as newborn babies in christ we
[48:31] know that the spirit itself beareth
[48:33] witness with our spirit that we are the
[48:36] children of god
[48:37] if your spirit contrary to god today you
[48:40] are not a child of god
[48:44] but you can be
[48:46] but you can be there's an open door
[48:48] there's there's a facility called the
[48:50] bible and the new birth and the teachers
[48:53] of the message and and listening to what
[48:55] god says to you
[48:57] yeah that'll get you in
[48:59] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[49:01] and joined heirs with christ now
[49:04] of what
[49:06] heirs of what
[49:11] well well you know jude's mother passed
[49:14] away and she's the heir
[49:16] she's the heir to
[49:18] to the the property and and come to find
[49:20] out
[49:21] grandma didn't or jackie didn't own
[49:23] nothing
[49:25] what are you heir of
[49:28] but now she knows she's the heir of two
[49:30] homes which one's already sold and pray
[49:32] the other one does but all that she's
[49:34] heir to that because there's something
[49:35] there
[49:37] so in the same way with jesus christ you
[49:38] can't just say well i'm an heir of god
[49:40] and then you don't come to church you
[49:41] don't read your bible
[49:43] you understand what i'm saying you're
[49:44] not going to get
[49:46] an inherit yeah you're going to
[49:47] inheritance but it ain't going to be a
[49:48] good one
[49:50] all right
[49:52] i'm just telling you i want to read
[49:54] where paul tells us we need to we need
[49:56] to be gone from those early principles
[49:59] of and we know we got new ones and we
[50:01] know that there's
[50:02] uh uh needs to be a repentance and
[50:04] baptism we know that we had four
[50:06] baptized last weekend so thank god for
[50:08] that
[50:09] amen
[50:10] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[50:12] and joint heirs with christ whatever
[50:14] christ has got we're going to get
[50:16] all right so what has he got the whole
[50:18] bible
[50:21] genesis to revelations is ours
[50:23] all right and what lays in that well we
[50:25] just keep trying to tell you about it
[50:27] amen
[50:29] god keeps trying to tell us about it
[50:31] but today we're and if children didn't
[50:33] heirs now watch
[50:35] and join us with christ if so be that we
[50:38] just lollygag around with him and
[50:40] and it's all right if we don't do this
[50:42] that's not what it said
[50:44] it says suffer with him and we're going
[50:46] to talk about that a little bit in
[50:47] hebrews
[50:48] paul was one that knew about suffering
[50:52] paul knew he was beat with stripes
[50:55] three times i believe it was 39 or 40
[50:57] minus one
[50:59] he was stoned
[51:00] almost killed
[51:02] he knowed what suffering was about
[51:04] all right
[51:05] that we may also what be glorified
[51:07] together
[51:09] i was thinking the other day you look at
[51:10] all these this junk in the world and
[51:12] they're glorifying this and they're
[51:14] glorifying that now they're glorifying
[51:16] whatever gender you want to be they're
[51:18] glorifying whatever you want to have a
[51:20] change if you don't like being a girl
[51:22] you can be a boy if you need to that'd
[51:23] be all right it's okay
[51:25] well
[51:26] not to god
[51:28] and not to you and me as christians
[51:31] we're going to be glorified together
[51:33] with jesus christ or whatever he gets we
[51:35] get whatever glorification he gets we
[51:37] get
[51:38] that's why those he has justified he has
[51:40] already glorified because we're
[51:42] glorified in who in christ
[51:46] everybody all right
[51:48] so i want you to listen to this i'm
[51:50] gonna read this little quote they don't
[51:51] have it back there
[51:53] but if you'll pull the uh
[51:57] the little uh adoptions the one that bob
[51:59] did one with the three
[52:01] three play three stages on the pyramid
[52:04] we'll talk about that just for a second
[52:06] real quick because peter tells us
[52:09] in second peter one he says
[52:11] this is another one that knows about
[52:13] statue of a perfect man
[52:15] he's a he's a liar and he was
[52:18] he cursed and
[52:20] cut somebody's ear off and said i'll
[52:22] just kill every one of you leave my lord
[52:24] alone don't wash my feet lord
[52:26] none of that
[52:28] to them that have obtained like precious
[52:30] faith with us through the righteousness
[52:32] of god and our savior jesus christ and
[52:34] said beside this giving all diligence
[52:36] add are we having problems back there
[52:41] they're not getting this stuff on the
[52:42] screen
[52:46] we just used it two weeks ago
[52:51] bob
[52:52] if you can go help him
[52:55] because it was on the screen and was on
[52:56] the thing
[52:57] a couple weeks ago we used it so anyway
[53:01] so remember there's three stages of
[53:02] adoption so let's just let's just
[53:04] imagine what we got all this imagination
[53:06] let's just imagine
[53:08] that we've got a pyramid right here
[53:09] we'll just use this one
[53:11] all
[53:12] right at faith you receive the new birth
[53:15] is that right
[53:17] all right at faith
[53:19] i i somebody sent me a link to a
[53:22] preacher in the message that a lot of
[53:23] you know
[53:26] that's preaching now that you got to
[53:28] have you got to get all these virtues a
[53:30] piece of these a piece that you get part
[53:32] of the whole i don't know how you
[53:33] underst i can't understand listen it's
[53:36] like dad said to preach the truth just
[53:38] listen to what truth is
[53:41] same way with daniel 70 weeks what is
[53:43] truth truth's in the bible
[53:46] truth's in the bible peter says right
[53:47] here
[53:48] simon peter a servant apostle jesus
[53:50] christ to them that have obtained
[53:53] like precious faith with us through the
[53:54] righteousness of god and besides this
[53:58] besides this new birth
[54:01] giving all diligence add to your faith
[54:04] verse your knowledge temperance so we're
[54:05] going to look justification sanitation
[54:07] baptism of the holy ghost everybody got
[54:08] that you don't have to wait up here this
[54:11] is a special anointing of the holy ghost
[54:13] but it's not the new birth
[54:16] everybody with me
[54:18] because peter is talking about like
[54:20] precious faith if peter was born again
[54:23] we gonna be like peter
[54:26] and obviously he was cause he was one of
[54:28] the 120 in the upper room and you know
[54:30] what
[54:30] a preacher didn't have to tell him the
[54:32] bible told me
[54:33] that the holy ghost fell on 120 in the
[54:35] upper room and they got the holy ghost
[54:37] they got the new birth so there's no
[54:39] there's no qualms of peter ever how he
[54:41] acted in his previous life he's got the
[54:43] new birth and he's writing the bible i
[54:45] can't understand why people don't
[54:47] believe people and it's written in the
[54:48] bible
[54:50] plain as day he said beside this giving
[54:53] all diligence add
[54:56] what add to your faith virtue you verse
[54:58] your knowledge knowledge temperance and
[54:59] prescription godliness brother kindness
[55:02] and then love and then brother branham
[55:04] thank god he sent us a prophet
[55:06] that told us what this was he said
[55:08] that's what seals everything together
[55:11] that's what seals all these virtues
[55:13] together because listen
[55:15] we are not a loose group of people
[55:20] tossed about by every wind of doctrine
[55:22] sleight of man silly women led away and
[55:25] that's
[55:26] that's talking about church
[55:28] silly women right women bride churches
[55:31] this led away by every little doctrine
[55:33] this away and every little doctrine this
[55:35] way
[55:36] we are not caught up in that we're
[55:38] supposed to be on a firm foundation
[55:40] we're not supposed to be if the wind
[55:43] blows this away we just go that way if
[55:45] if somebody wants to preach this and and
[55:47] and he gets a long prayer line and and
[55:50] you feel good and you start crying
[55:53] that don't mean one thing to me
[55:57] let me listen to what he's got to say
[56:00] let me listen to the word first
[56:03] give me the word first
[56:05] because you know what satan's going to
[56:06] do in the end time false anointed ones
[56:08] they're anointed with the true holy
[56:10] ghost
[56:11] but it's not on the word that they
[56:13] preach
[56:15] it's an emotion
[56:16] it's in the spirit realm memory reason
[56:19] conscious affects the imagination it's
[56:20] in that realm it's not in the soul
[56:23] thank you
[56:26] [Applause]
[56:31] and i thank god bob did that bob did
[56:33] this not too long ago and i really
[56:34] appreciate it y'all can see we're gonna
[56:36] look at this one
[56:37] so you see this so this is the new birth
[56:41] but at the new birth does that finish
[56:43] what you're looking at no it begins what
[56:45] you're working on
[56:47] it begins your faith and then now look
[56:50] brother brown said you can't he didn't
[56:51] say you couldn't have faith he said you
[56:53] rightly can't have faith
[56:55] without look watch and we can never
[56:57] rightly be able to have faith until
[56:59] positionally we know what we are so now
[57:02] right now we know that we're a son of
[57:04] god
[57:06] amen
[57:08] we're son and daughter of god right here
[57:10] listen israel was israel in egypt
[57:14] so we're going to get to that in a
[57:15] minute
[57:16] israel didn't become israel they were
[57:18] the children of god to begin with
[57:22] and they had a covenant we'll talk about
[57:23] that we'll talk about immutability if we
[57:25] get to it if we don't we will this
[57:26] afternoon those of you that get those
[57:28] notes use them tonight because i'm going
[57:29] to stop at a certain place and then
[57:31] we'll re restart this afternoon
[57:34] so justification thanks question the new
[57:36] birth puts you in the body of christ
[57:38] listen you can't have
[57:41] virtue
[57:42] you can't have godly virtue
[57:45] and not have the new birth what's it
[57:46] going to draw from
[57:49] so there's no way you have to wait till
[57:51] you get up here to get the holy spirit
[57:53] no you get the new birth now look the
[57:56] new birth and the holy spirit's two
[57:57] different things remember
[58:00] hello somebody
[58:02] brother brown said you can have the holy
[58:03] ghost every day of your life on your
[58:05] spirit realm and die and go to hell but
[58:07] you can't have the new birth and die and
[58:09] go to hell
[58:12] he said you mean they're different
[58:13] they're different but they're the same
[58:15] it's the position you put them in
[58:17] everybody with me say amen
[58:19] so this is not a new new birth once you
[58:22] get born again you're sealed
[58:24] as i said before the caps put on
[58:26] whatever's inside is going to stay in
[58:27] there
[58:28] but you can decide though whether this
[58:31] what does sanctification mean clean and
[58:33] set aside for service now you've already
[58:36] been clean down here
[58:41] but i die daily paul says there's things
[58:44] that brother bible is talking about
[58:45] circumcision different things it's got
[58:46] to be it's got to be shed off and
[58:49] when when joshua came to go into the
[58:52] promised land to positionally place the
[58:55] the children of israel what do you have
[58:56] to do he had to circumcise the one he
[58:59] didn't re-circumcise himself
[59:03] everybody got that he did not have to
[59:05] him and caleb
[59:07] you didn't have to re-circumcise them
[59:08] they were already circumcised
[59:10] everybody with me
[59:14] but the ones that grew
[59:16] up in the message
[59:19] in the journey
[59:21] had to be circumcised
[59:22] all right so they come to a position
[59:24] that you have to be circumcised you have
[59:27] to be circumcised to get in the land
[59:29] this is your land
[59:32] this is your property this is your
[59:35] heirs and joint heirs
[59:37] you're an heir of that
[59:40] and it took a profit to put it all
[59:42] together and show us look this is yours
[59:47] now what the prophet of god say he said
[59:49] now i'm going to present that though to
[59:51] god
[59:55] so somewhere somebody's got to be that
[59:58] for brother brown to present that to god
[1:00:00] remember the people when he went across
[1:00:01] the curtain of time
[1:00:03] said you'll go back so we'll come back
[1:00:04] and we'll be judged by what you say
[1:00:06] and we'll be presented before god
[1:00:09] and this one brother brown said well did
[1:00:10] paul make it and i said yeah he said
[1:00:11] well praise god i'll make it because
[1:00:13] he's preaching the same gospel
[1:00:16] but they say he was false
[1:00:19] pitiful people i'm telling you blind
[1:00:21] wretched miserable naked and don't know
[1:00:23] it and we're going to read about it a
[1:00:24] little bit in hebrews but everybody all
[1:00:25] right we're right here we have to have
[1:00:29] the new birth before god can quicken or
[1:00:31] make alive anything else in our life
[1:00:36] because what are you going to quicken it
[1:00:37] with
[1:00:38] man people we were dead
[1:00:40] we were dead in sin and then we gonna
[1:00:42] have to go up all the way there before
[1:00:43] we get the holy spirit
[1:00:49] man's intelligence will tell you that
[1:00:52] man's wisdom will tell you that but
[1:00:53] god's wisdom will not tell you that
[1:00:55] god's intelligence will not tell you
[1:00:57] that
[1:00:58] but we have to come to a new birth you
[1:01:00] have to come to a justified sanctified
[1:01:02] state filled with the baptism of the
[1:01:04] holy ghost
[1:01:05] do like the four did last week get
[1:01:07] baptized no
[1:01:09] get the foundation right to start with
[1:01:12] repent
[1:01:13] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:01:14] christ for your mission and your sins
[1:01:16] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:01:18] holy ghost what a promise
[1:01:20] and we know how to become baptized so
[1:01:22] you know what god had to
[1:01:24] you hear me now
[1:01:27] you repent
[1:01:29] you get baptized in the name of jesus
[1:01:31] christ
[1:01:34] rightly
[1:01:36] god's got to give you the holy ghost
[1:01:38] god's got to give you the holy ghost
[1:01:41] you say god can do anything he wants to
[1:01:44] god cannot do what his word said he
[1:01:46] couldn't do or could do right he only
[1:01:49] can do the word says repent be baptized
[1:01:51] in the name of jesus christ for your
[1:01:52] mission and you see him and you shall
[1:01:54] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:01:57] for this promise
[1:01:59] see that's why i see um immutability
[1:02:01] we'll talk about it later on maybe even
[1:02:02] tonight is the way it's going now
[1:02:04] immutability of his counsel he can't
[1:02:08] change
[1:02:11] can't change at all
[1:02:14] but the connection is though is the
[1:02:16] immutability of me and you
[1:02:20] oh
[1:02:21] you went too far
[1:02:23] no
[1:02:25] the problem with adam was is he didn't
[1:02:28] have he wasn't immutable
[1:02:33] he changed
[1:02:36] so do all of us
[1:02:38] we've made changes in our life the 15
[1:02:40] minutes ago we may have we made a change
[1:02:43] god has never changed
[1:02:46] but god said if you eat of this
[1:02:48] you're going to die if you don't eat it
[1:02:51] you're going to live
[1:02:52] all right
[1:02:54] he made the covenant
[1:02:56] but it was conditional
[1:02:58] adam broke the covenant
[1:03:01] now we'll get into it later on where god
[1:03:04] made a covenant with abraham and said i
[1:03:06] will abraham i don't care if you try to
[1:03:08] give your wife away twice
[1:03:10] i don't care what you what do you
[1:03:12] whatever you do you're gonna have a
[1:03:13] child
[1:03:16] i'm gonna give it to you to sarah
[1:03:21] same way with me and you thank god
[1:03:24] he didn't see all the things that we had
[1:03:25] to go through i mean he did but it
[1:03:27] didn't hinder him we come to this spot
[1:03:29] right here
[1:03:31] and get the new birth
[1:03:33] and then we start growing
[1:03:35] and then this holy spirit is a special
[1:03:37] anointing then you've got a special
[1:03:39] anointing there but this right here you
[1:03:41] have to go this way you can't turn the
[1:03:43] pyramid upside down because look this is
[1:03:46] the son of man right this person it's
[1:03:49] the son of man that's jesus christ
[1:03:51] because he has all this
[1:03:54] he didn't need faith he was faith he
[1:03:56] didn't need virtue or already had it
[1:03:58] because he was born right the first time
[1:03:59] you and me didn't get it because we were
[1:04:01] born in sin
[1:04:02] shaping iniquity
[1:04:04] had a carnal mind
[1:04:07] i know this is simple but
[1:04:10] there's a supernatural element if you'll
[1:04:11] pay attention to it
[1:04:13] there's something in there for all of us
[1:04:16] if you'll pay attention to it so besides
[1:04:18] all this
[1:04:19] paul's peter said besides all this
[1:04:23] add to your faith virtue
[1:04:27] because remember faith's not an ad
[1:04:31] face to birth
[1:04:33] faith is not an ad
[1:04:36] virtue is an ad one two three four five
[1:04:38] six seven
[1:04:42] everybody with me
[1:04:44] it doesn't say add to your carnal mind
[1:04:46] faith
[1:04:47] no it said get faith
[1:04:50] get faith first get the look how long
[1:04:52] and big faith is
[1:04:57] and besides this giving all
[1:05:00] diligence
[1:05:03] leave that up there for just a second
[1:05:05] because what we're going to talk about
[1:05:07] look and over here you see that this is
[1:05:09] the revelation of the son of god
[1:05:12] remember the headstone was removed it
[1:05:14] was rejected there was no headship
[1:05:17] and don't get me wrong down to the
[1:05:18] church ages you have to be
[1:05:20] careful when you say this
[1:05:23] but the headship was not the way it
[1:05:26] should have been in the church ages
[1:05:28] people were born again
[1:05:30] people came to certain amount of these
[1:05:32] virtues but they never had the opening
[1:05:34] of the seals they never had the thunder
[1:05:35] they never had the total open book to
[1:05:38] deal with because remember i told you a
[1:05:40] long time ago when jesus walked into
[1:05:42] that temple he opened the book
[1:05:44] he revealed who he was
[1:05:47] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:05:49] right brother brother said the greatest
[1:05:50] anointing
[1:05:51] not jumping shout and speaking in
[1:05:53] tongues no he knew who he was
[1:05:56] but remember he shut the book back and
[1:05:58] handed it to the priest
[1:05:59] so what had to happen in revelations 10
[1:06:02] that same christ had to come down in
[1:06:05] spirit form and anoint a prophet in the
[1:06:07] end time with an open book
[1:06:10] and according to luke 17 30
[1:06:13] malachi 4 5 and all those different
[1:06:15] scriptures the son of man had to come
[1:06:17] back god in human flesh in not just one
[1:06:20] man but men sons and daughters of god
[1:06:24] we know brother brown was the first
[1:06:25] fruits but listen without him we
[1:06:27] wouldn't know what was going on listen
[1:06:28] i'll ask you a question
[1:06:31] all right you ready
[1:06:34] blank brother round them out of your
[1:06:35] mind
[1:06:36] y'all blank me out why can't you blank
[1:06:38] him now
[1:06:42] he never came
[1:06:44] who you gonna listen to
[1:06:46] well i just get it for myself huh
[1:06:49] you need an apostle prophet a pastor
[1:06:51] teaching an evangelist
[1:06:53] to perfect you
[1:06:55] right so you're gonna listen to
[1:06:57] that's what i want to ask all these
[1:06:58] people think brother brown's you know
[1:06:59] gone wrong or whatever it is and he
[1:07:00] wasn't the he wasn't a prophet god's got
[1:07:03] to send to somebody
[1:07:05] or this confusion is going to continue
[1:07:07] we're just going to keep living and
[1:07:08] dying living and dying but there's a
[1:07:10] promise that god would send somebody
[1:07:14] i don't mind if it was william branham
[1:07:18] that don't bother me
[1:07:20] it don't bother me where he was born
[1:07:23] don't bother me where he was raised or
[1:07:25] how he talked
[1:07:27] it doesn't bother me that he said four
[1:07:28] thousand i meant 400 or what i i
[1:07:30] probably got that wrong
[1:07:33] that was a human mortal man
[1:07:36] but when he was preaching the word of
[1:07:37] god that was god speaking
[1:07:41] the voice of god
[1:07:44] now they want to to to discredit the
[1:07:46] voice of god
[1:07:48] well guess what they've done
[1:07:50] they put satan where he's supposed to
[1:07:51] where he wants to be
[1:07:53] the head of the church
[1:07:55] their so-called church
[1:07:57] not this church
[1:07:59] so the stack so that's the son of god
[1:08:01] that's the revelation down through the
[1:08:02] church ages everybody that was born
[1:08:05] again had potential to receive all these
[1:08:08] virtues
[1:08:09] everybody with me
[1:08:11] but now they did not have the they did
[1:08:13] have the potential because of the holy
[1:08:15] ghost but according to the word of god
[1:08:17] remember what i said brother brown said
[1:08:18] everybody got a box
[1:08:20] luther got a box wesley got a box
[1:08:21] pentecost got a box we got a box our box
[1:08:24] is adoption our box is to bring the head
[1:08:26] ship back our box is to bring the seven
[1:08:29] mysteries of the seven seals and the
[1:08:30] seven thunders and all those great
[1:08:32] things and i hope it don't go overhead
[1:08:34] and sometimes we use terminology and you
[1:08:36] just say somebody says seals and you
[1:08:37] turn it off just don't worry about it
[1:08:40] it's the plan of redemption
[1:08:42] it's how you're going to get a body
[1:08:44] change where paul couldn't get it luther
[1:08:47] couldn't get it wesley couldn't get it
[1:08:49] brother adam couldn't get it
[1:08:50] but he prophesied that somebody would
[1:08:53] and that's the headstone the son of man
[1:08:55] revelation so what are we trying to do
[1:08:57] we're trying to get us all up to that
[1:09:02] it's not that this part is not down here
[1:09:06] but he began
[1:09:08] as the chief cornerstone no doubt
[1:09:12] but he's the head
[1:09:15] now hold on who's the head who's the
[1:09:17] head what's his name
[1:09:20] what's the headstone's name
[1:09:22] thank you jesus christ
[1:09:25] right
[1:09:26] who's the headstone one more time
[1:09:27] everybody
[1:09:32] one more time
[1:09:35] hmm
[1:09:37] romans 8 verse 17 says is them children
[1:09:40] then heirs
[1:09:42] heirs of god
[1:09:44] and joint heirs with
[1:09:48] hmm
[1:09:51] hmm
[1:09:55] say man did i just not tell you he was a
[1:09:57] headstone
[1:09:58] i'm sorry y'all told me he was a
[1:10:00] headstone so now i just read to you that
[1:10:03] if he's the headstone
[1:10:05] and if we're joint heirs with christ
[1:10:07] that makes
[1:10:08] us part of the headstone
[1:10:11] the thing that's going to count this
[1:10:13] pyramid off and seal it like we're
[1:10:16] talking about well i'm getting ahead of
[1:10:17] myself but justification scientification
[1:10:19] and the body change we got to go through
[1:10:21] these different stages but let's go to
[1:10:23] romans we'll never get to this if i
[1:10:24] don't
[1:10:26] hush
[1:10:28] let's go to romans because we i mean
[1:10:29] hebrews sorry hebrews
[1:10:31] as in romans because romans gives us in
[1:10:34] part two part two of your birth
[1:10:37] your new birth starts here and then part
[1:10:38] two is the growth development
[1:10:41] all right
[1:10:42] part three is the body change everybody
[1:10:44] got that if you read it in romans so now
[1:10:46] let's go to hebrews
[1:10:48] two
[1:10:50] and let's just go scripture by scripture
[1:10:52] if you don't mind looking onto the
[1:10:55] to the
[1:10:57] screen or you can read it in your bible
[1:10:58] but we're going to go through it
[1:11:00] kind of slow that's all right a little
[1:11:02] bit of sunday school this morning
[1:11:04] seems like y'all are sitting somewhere
[1:11:05] else but we'll get through this
[1:11:09] how shall we escape
[1:11:13] all right how shall we escape if we
[1:11:15] neglect so great a salvation
[1:11:20] leave this up here and let them that's
[1:11:21] good i'm glad they can do that
[1:11:25] how shall we escape if we neglect
[1:11:28] our our bottom of the pyramid salvation
[1:11:32] because it all starts with salvation
[1:11:34] being born again
[1:11:36] not of corruptible seed but of
[1:11:38] incorruptible seed by what by the word
[1:11:39] of god
[1:11:41] all right which at the first began to be
[1:11:44] spoken by the lord
[1:11:46] and was confirmed unto us by them that
[1:11:48] hurt him
[1:11:49] now this is paul speaking
[1:11:52] god also bearing them witness
[1:11:54] both with signs and wonders and with
[1:11:56] many miracles diverse miracles and gifts
[1:11:59] of the holy ghost according to his own
[1:12:01] will right at the new birth you receive
[1:12:05] the ability to have signs and wonders
[1:12:07] speak in tongues god is able to give you
[1:12:09] revelation
[1:12:12] but he wants to go higher
[1:12:14] he wants you to know more
[1:12:16] he don't want you to just sit there
[1:12:18] and say well
[1:12:20] i'm a son and daughter of god
[1:12:22] he wants to put you in action
[1:12:25] all right so let's look at verse five
[1:12:28] for unto the angels hath he not put in
[1:12:30] subjection the whole world to come
[1:12:31] wherever we speak
[1:12:33] we sing that song open the eyes of my
[1:12:35] heart and every time i we sing that part
[1:12:37] says holy holy holy we know that
[1:12:40] in many um scriptures and then brother
[1:12:42] branham said that the the angels are
[1:12:44] before the throne saying holy holy holy
[1:12:47] they don't know how to say holy holy
[1:12:48] like we do
[1:12:52] they can't they can't say that with
[1:12:54] redemption in their heart
[1:12:56] they never they don't understand what it
[1:12:58] is to be lost
[1:13:00] but we do
[1:13:01] and when we say holy holy holy we know
[1:13:03] what we're talking about
[1:13:07] don't get me wrong god loves the praise
[1:13:09] of angels but he loves the praise of me
[1:13:10] and you more
[1:13:12] hello
[1:13:14] he loves to pray
[1:13:16] he'll tell him angels hey hush
[1:13:19] hush
[1:13:21] i got a child need something down here
[1:13:22] y'all be quiet
[1:13:24] i want to listen to what they've got to
[1:13:25] say cause they're mine
[1:13:27] i bore them they're my children they
[1:13:30] came from me
[1:13:35] [Applause]
[1:13:37] but one in a certain place testified
[1:13:39] saying what is man that thou art mindful
[1:13:41] of him
[1:13:42] or the son of man that thou visteth him
[1:13:45] now watch what he done he came down here
[1:13:47] thou made us him a little lower than the
[1:13:49] angels
[1:13:51] what the angels are created beings
[1:13:55] but god sent his son
[1:13:57] we'll see in just a minute
[1:13:58] lower than the angels he came down here
[1:14:00] in human flesh because you know what he
[1:14:02] could die
[1:14:04] he got tired
[1:14:07] all these different things
[1:14:08] that an angel doesn't have to worry with
[1:14:11] so he made him a little lower than the
[1:14:12] angels thou crownest him with glory and
[1:14:14] honor
[1:14:18] now watch
[1:14:20] and dissent him over the works of thy
[1:14:22] hands
[1:14:24] and thou has put all things in
[1:14:25] subjection under his feet who's that
[1:14:30] class participation if you'll say jesus
[1:14:32] christ
[1:14:33] that means you're not asleep
[1:14:36] jesus christ
[1:14:38] what's wrong with y'all today do i need
[1:14:40] to just quit do i hire somebody to come
[1:14:43] in here and preach to him
[1:14:45] huh
[1:14:46] will you sit down like a stone face
[1:14:49] like a sinner
[1:14:50] you ought to be happy
[1:14:52] sorry about that but good lord
[1:14:54] i've seen people get more excited at a
[1:14:56] concert
[1:14:59] any kind of concert
[1:15:01] i've seen women at a tupperware party
[1:15:04] that's been more excited than you all
[1:15:05] are
[1:15:08] and a baby shower oh look what she got
[1:15:14] it's diapers lady
[1:15:21] but thou has put all things in
[1:15:23] subjection under his feet now who we
[1:15:25] talking about jesus christ let's go back
[1:15:26] to heirs and join heirs
[1:15:30] he's trying to get us to see that
[1:15:32] everything has been put under our feet
[1:15:34] because there's one thing left and
[1:15:36] that's to conquer death who's he going
[1:15:37] to conquer it to angels
[1:15:38] who's he going to conquer it through
[1:15:40] people that are already dead nope
[1:15:42] he's going to conquer it through people
[1:15:44] who are already alive
[1:15:46] be alive and remain
[1:15:49] look for in that he put in subjection
[1:15:51] under him he left nothing that is not
[1:15:54] put under his feet but now watch paul
[1:15:55] said okay hold on a minute
[1:15:57] i'm telling you this but now you're
[1:15:59] going well now look we're still dying
[1:16:01] he says but now we see not yet all
[1:16:03] things put under him that's what we're
[1:16:05] looking at right here
[1:16:07] we don't see we see all things
[1:16:10] he's the head
[1:16:13] this is his feet
[1:16:15] all things under subjection to this man
[1:16:19] but we're still dying
[1:16:21] because we got growth to do
[1:16:22] we got growing up to do
[1:16:26] they always put all things in subjection
[1:16:28] under his feet what is subjection what
[1:16:30] is the when i started reading this i
[1:16:31] thought man subjection what is all this
[1:16:33] right here this is you taking your old
[1:16:37] nature your old part of you and putting
[1:16:39] it under subjection to this new way of
[1:16:42] life this new virtue knowledge
[1:16:44] temperance godliness not just that i can
[1:16:46] cry and
[1:16:48] and i can um sing good or i i got my
[1:16:52] gold star attendance at church
[1:16:55] it's what's inside of you
[1:16:57] it's what you carry out there
[1:17:04] but now we see not yet all things put
[1:17:07] under him and i wrote myself a note we
[1:17:09] still see death
[1:17:11] we still see death
[1:17:13] right and we look at ourselves go take a
[1:17:16] picture of the 10 years ago that you saw
[1:17:18] we was watching brother bob the other
[1:17:19] night
[1:17:21] 10 years ago he had some real black hair
[1:17:25] yeah he ain't that way now
[1:17:27] he looked like a little kid he looked
[1:17:29] kind of like that
[1:17:30] but not anymore
[1:17:32] his youngest has done growed up
[1:17:34] especially them girl
[1:17:38] kaylee especially
[1:17:41] i'm sorry i didn't mean to say that
[1:17:44] but we still see death so what have we
[1:17:46] got to do though if everything's been
[1:17:48] put under his feet
[1:17:49] something's got to evolve
[1:17:52] to take that death part away
[1:17:54] to where it says we but now we see not
[1:17:56] yet all things put under him and that's
[1:17:58] what we're working under the son of god
[1:18:00] revelation christians were going to die
[1:18:03] under the son of god revelation
[1:18:08] but a true revelation of the son of man
[1:18:09] you won't
[1:18:11] revelation son of man you can't die
[1:18:14] he's already died
[1:18:16] jesus christ has already died he's
[1:18:18] already listen if he's paid the price
[1:18:23] you want to say about about all of us
[1:18:26] all this baggage that we're carrying and
[1:18:28] we
[1:18:29] we try our best
[1:18:31] to uh
[1:18:32] get everybody to forgive me i i gotta
[1:18:35] have everybody's got
[1:18:37] god's forgive you already
[1:18:39] i know you got to make things right but
[1:18:41] if god's forgive you put it in the sea
[1:18:42] of forgetfulness and quit fishing we're
[1:18:45] pulling it back out
[1:18:47] we keep throwing the old doubt near the
[1:18:48] end and we keep dragging that stuff back
[1:18:50] up quit doing that
[1:18:52] let's move on with god but now brother
[1:18:55] five years ago i couldn't
[1:18:57] i ain't worried about five years ago
[1:19:00] i was doing some things five years ago i
[1:19:02] don't do now
[1:19:03] you ought to say the same thing
[1:19:06] that's growth development
[1:19:08] i still got a lot of other things to
[1:19:09] work on but there's a few things that
[1:19:12] you need to know you got shed out of
[1:19:14] your life it's shed shed off of your
[1:19:17] life
[1:19:19] that's why when this thing's brother
[1:19:20] branham will read the vision maybe a
[1:19:22] couple weeks from now but the vision he
[1:19:24] had a sister shepherd listen this was
[1:19:26] the pyramid right
[1:19:29] and brother brown was preaching on it
[1:19:30] sister shepard's standing down here
[1:19:31] wondering she's born again well yes
[1:19:33] she's boarding in cause she's standing
[1:19:34] in the water he said but there was a man
[1:19:36] up here at the top
[1:19:38] pouring water down in here
[1:19:42] and what was coming out trash
[1:19:45] trash was flowing out and coming down
[1:19:47] this way now look if this wasn't sealed
[1:19:50] it just go right back in
[1:19:53] but it's sealed so once it's sealed it
[1:19:54] just sheds right off
[1:19:56] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[1:19:59] i like that i like that man i'm telling
[1:20:01] you if it was a flat roof we'd have
[1:20:03] trouble
[1:20:04] but look how steep that is
[1:20:08] running water
[1:20:10] everybody right now
[1:20:14] but this is us folks when i was reading
[1:20:16] this i thought man this is every one of
[1:20:17] us
[1:20:18] let's go to verse 9. but we see jesus do
[1:20:21] we see jesus
[1:20:23] we ought to see him more clear now than
[1:20:25] anybody they see him as a second person
[1:20:27] they see him as a good guy they see him
[1:20:29] as this person we see him as god
[1:20:31] almighty we see him the way he wants us
[1:20:33] to see him see that's why it puts us in
[1:20:35] that channel
[1:20:37] we're not out of the channel we're in
[1:20:40] the right channel
[1:20:41] heirs and joiners we're in the right
[1:20:43] family
[1:20:46] listen if you're not born again you're
[1:20:47] not in the family of god
[1:20:52] you're a child of the devil
[1:20:54] sorry we all were
[1:20:57] but we see jesus
[1:20:59] who was made a little lower than the
[1:21:01] angels for the suffering of death
[1:21:03] crowned with glory and honor that he by
[1:21:05] the grace of god should taste death for
[1:21:08] every man
[1:21:09] for it became him for whom are all
[1:21:11] things and by whom are all things and
[1:21:14] bringing what
[1:21:16] sons
[1:21:18] bringing us into the family into being
[1:21:21] the heir
[1:21:23] of this eternal life remember
[1:21:25] my favorite quote jesus didn't come to
[1:21:27] bring you an inheritance
[1:21:29] he came to bring you back to your
[1:21:31] inheritance
[1:21:33] you already had an inheritance that was
[1:21:35] the immutability of god there's an
[1:21:37] inheritance
[1:21:39] there is eternal life there is growth
[1:21:41] development there is a camping off to
[1:21:44] the of the pyramid there is a body
[1:21:46] change but you've got to be pulled into
[1:21:48] that
[1:21:49] twice third pool second pool first pools
[1:21:52] god's pulling you into this place god's
[1:21:54] pulling you up that statue of a perfect
[1:21:56] man
[1:21:57] by what the holy spirit
[1:21:59] it's in exactly the right place to be
[1:22:02] able to look at the full story to look
[1:22:04] at the full picture of what brother
[1:22:05] brown was preaching you can't change
[1:22:07] this pyramid
[1:22:09] some people want to turn it upside down
[1:22:11] they won't do that leave it the way it
[1:22:12] is
[1:22:14] same way with daniel 70 weeks they want
[1:22:15] to change the chart well you know what
[1:22:17] brother branham we were talking to
[1:22:19] somebody the other day
[1:22:20] brother brown said this is that saith
[1:22:22] the lord how are you going to get away
[1:22:23] from that
[1:22:25] how are you going to get away from thus
[1:22:26] saith the lord
[1:22:28] then you're denying what the lord said
[1:22:32] oh no brother no you're denying what the
[1:22:34] lord said
[1:22:36] sorry for you buddy
[1:22:38] for in that he would put all he i'm
[1:22:40] sorry verse eight
[1:22:42] no we got verse nine
[1:22:44] so he should taste death for every man
[1:22:46] for it became him
[1:22:48] for whom are all things and by whom are
[1:22:50] all things and bringing many sons what
[1:22:54] into
[1:22:57] the fold into the
[1:23:00] family of god
[1:23:02] everybody with me
[1:23:04] and mate the captain of their salvation
[1:23:06] perfect through suffering he had to
[1:23:08] suffer
[1:23:09] we've read that back 20 some sermons ago
[1:23:12] he learned by the things he suffered he
[1:23:14] grew in grace and knowledge he came to
[1:23:16] perfection not in his soul
[1:23:21] but in his body that he took that god
[1:23:23] took over
[1:23:24] that body on resurrection morning
[1:23:28] which is jesus christ we know that it
[1:23:30] wasn't two separate people
[1:23:32] he didn't send jesus back to go under
[1:23:33] that body that was god's body it was
[1:23:36] god's body to start with
[1:23:39] thank god for revelation
[1:23:42] for it became him for whom are all
[1:23:43] things and by whom are all things then
[1:23:45] bringing many sons
[1:23:47] unto glory to make the captain of their
[1:23:49] salvation perfect through suffering look
[1:23:51] for both he that sanctifieth
[1:23:54] that's god
[1:23:56] that's jesus christ everybody with me
[1:23:58] put jesus christ right here
[1:24:00] all right
[1:24:01] for both he that sanctified and they
[1:24:03] that are who are sanctified
[1:24:07] are all of two
[1:24:11] what
[1:24:13] what i can't read that let me read that
[1:24:16] again
[1:24:17] for both he that sanctifies his later
[1:24:19] sanctified are all of one
[1:24:22] airs and joint heirs
[1:24:25] we got to start believing that that's
[1:24:26] where that faith has got to be we've got
[1:24:28] to build enough faith
[1:24:30] to be able to move up into virtue build
[1:24:32] enough virtue to move up into knowledge
[1:24:34] temperance patience all the way up
[1:24:36] everybody with me
[1:24:41] and look what god said
[1:24:44] for which cause
[1:24:46] he is not ashamed
[1:24:48] to call them brethren
[1:24:52] welcome in
[1:24:54] welcome home child
[1:24:56] let's go to hebrews 3
[1:25:01] verse 6.
[1:25:03] i want you to read hebrews i know bob's
[1:25:06] going through it but i want you to read
[1:25:08] hebrews and take all the chapters out
[1:25:11] because to me that's a continuous letter
[1:25:15] to me and you a continuous letter now
[1:25:17] now man had to you know he paused the
[1:25:18] thought man started a new one by putting
[1:25:20] chapters in there
[1:25:22] but you're going to see in just a minute
[1:25:23] if we get to it we may not we'll do it
[1:25:25] this afternoon i'm not worried about it
[1:25:27] you go from
[1:25:29] hebrews 5 to hebrews 6 and they should
[1:25:32] have made that one big long chapter
[1:25:35] because it's the same thought all the
[1:25:36] way through so let's read this right
[1:25:38] here and we're going to read hebrews 3
[1:25:41] verse 6.
[1:25:44] if i get finished with this we'll stop
[1:25:45] right here that we'll get this afternoon
[1:25:50] book
[1:25:51] but christ as a son over his own house
[1:25:55] whose house
[1:25:56] we are
[1:25:59] he's took possession
[1:26:03] we've let him into our house
[1:26:08] we've let him into the house
[1:26:11] but we've still got some rooms
[1:26:15] that we keep shut
[1:26:19] just picture
[1:26:21] god standing in your living room
[1:26:23] it's all right lord you can take
[1:26:24] possession of this this is your house
[1:26:26] completely you can have it it's yours
[1:26:29] well can i go on that don't no no no
[1:26:32] don't go in that dory
[1:26:34] come over this way
[1:26:36] yeah shy him away from that one over
[1:26:38] there
[1:26:39] like i told you many times before you
[1:26:40] know i'm glad brother brown said the
[1:26:41] holy ghost was timid he'd just let
[1:26:43] whatever you say that's what he's going
[1:26:44] to do
[1:26:45] it would have been me buddy i'd have the
[1:26:47] fireman's axe in my hand and if you tell
[1:26:49] me not to go through that door i'm going
[1:26:51] to knock your door down
[1:26:52] god's not going to do that
[1:26:56] because he's a gentleman
[1:26:58] and you know what if you don't want him
[1:27:00] to knock the door down
[1:27:02] he don't want to knock it down he wants
[1:27:04] you to make a choice
[1:27:05] how many of the preachers was preaching
[1:27:07] this weekend on choice and the different
[1:27:08] things it's a choice you got to make
[1:27:11] brother jewel on the different ones it's
[1:27:12] a choice you got to make that puts that
[1:27:14] predestinated seed there that puts that
[1:27:17] in the mind of god is that choice that
[1:27:19] you made now take choice away it takes
[1:27:22] free moral agency away it takes
[1:27:24] everything away you might as well just
[1:27:27] go home
[1:27:30] but even going up the statue of perfect
[1:27:31] man is a choice
[1:27:34] and you know what it's a hard choice
[1:27:36] because it really cuts away that spirit
[1:27:38] realm
[1:27:39] it really like brother bob was talking
[1:27:41] about and that stainless steel is what i
[1:27:42] looked it up while you're it's stainless
[1:27:44] steel
[1:27:45] are hardened steel
[1:27:47] is what they use but you know if you get
[1:27:49] cut by a real sharp razor blade
[1:27:51] you don't even know it
[1:27:54] now you get cut by serrated blade
[1:27:57] yeah right sister anna you get cut by a
[1:28:00] serrated blade and it rips and tears and
[1:28:02] pulls immediately you're doing this but
[1:28:04] now how many of you have got a real we
[1:28:06] used to hunt when we were hunting
[1:28:08] uh we used to skin deer and stuff
[1:28:10] but
[1:28:11] uh ricky fall bush we were hunting down
[1:28:14] in greene county
[1:28:16] and i had a wart that was on this finger
[1:28:18] right here never could get rid of it i
[1:28:19] was holding on like this and i mean that
[1:28:21] he had one that he just sharpened that
[1:28:23] thing up with shave hair he cut that
[1:28:25] thing on he cut it off and didn't know
[1:28:27] it it ain't going back since i never
[1:28:29] paid him for that but
[1:28:32] i see him again i'll pay him for it
[1:28:35] but i was cut and didn't know it that's
[1:28:37] what bob was talking about if a real
[1:28:39] good preacher
[1:28:40] that's led by the holy ghost he'll cut
[1:28:42] you and you'll never know it
[1:28:44] that's what i want
[1:28:46] i want to be cut
[1:28:48] uh if something needs to be got away
[1:28:50] from i want to get it out
[1:28:51] [Applause]
[1:28:55] because he said it's a two-edged sword
[1:28:57] it cuts going in
[1:28:58] cuts going out
[1:29:02] all right let's finish this and then
[1:29:04] we'll stop
[1:29:05] whose house we are he has took
[1:29:07] possession
[1:29:08] look watch this though if
[1:29:13] read it
[1:29:14] if we hold fast
[1:29:18] may i put faith in there
[1:29:21] if we hold fast the confidence and the
[1:29:23] rejoicing of the hope
[1:29:26] firm
[1:29:28] i tried to count i'm gonna finish
[1:29:29] counting but in the book of hebrews
[1:29:32] he says unto the end about ten times
[1:29:34] he's wanting us to get to the end of
[1:29:37] something
[1:29:38] he's wanting us to get somewhere he's
[1:29:40] wanting us to take a journey
[1:29:43] to the end
[1:29:44] consider the bible says the end of your
[1:29:46] conversation jesus christ the same
[1:29:48] yesterday today and forever
[1:29:50] unto the end which is the journey verse
[1:29:52] 7. wherefore as the holy ghost saith
[1:29:54] today if you will hear his voice
[1:29:57] harden out your heart as in the
[1:29:58] provocation what's he talking about
[1:30:01] children of israel
[1:30:02] there listen they're the children of god
[1:30:06] god give them a promise that they'll get
[1:30:08] out of egypt i'm going to take you out
[1:30:09] with a mighty hand and i'm going to put
[1:30:11] you in the promised land
[1:30:13] look what happened to them in between
[1:30:14] all that
[1:30:16] because they chose
[1:30:19] that way
[1:30:20] harden not your heart as into
[1:30:22] provocation what am i saying you can be
[1:30:24] born again
[1:30:27] and you can harden your heart
[1:30:30] to where you don't want these virtues or
[1:30:32] you don't want all them or you don't
[1:30:33] want to grow in god you say no
[1:30:36] brother ramsey
[1:30:38] brother branham tells a story about the
[1:30:41] preacher
[1:30:42] brother ramsey he says i don't want no
[1:30:44] more god got a spirit on him so i don't
[1:30:45] want no more god and got out and started
[1:30:47] going getting drunk and six months later
[1:30:48] he was dead
[1:30:50] brother brown said he took his child
[1:30:51] home
[1:30:52] so it wasn't mars name
[1:30:54] so our misbehavior and then brother
[1:30:56] brown tells us he continues on and says
[1:30:58] one
[1:30:59] a misbehavior of sin one sin can call
[1:31:01] the whole church to fail
[1:31:03] one sin
[1:31:06] that's why we need to pray for we walk
[1:31:08] in that door
[1:31:10] harden not your hearts as in the
[1:31:12] provocation what they provoked god
[1:31:14] in the day of temptation in the
[1:31:16] wilderness when your father's tempted me
[1:31:19] prove me and saw my works 40
[1:31:22] years
[1:31:24] may i say 60 years
[1:31:29] we were taken out with a mighty hand in
[1:31:31] 1963 64-65
[1:31:35] we were told the rapture's past due we
[1:31:37] were told that this book is now open we
[1:31:40] were told that now christ was on earth
[1:31:43] we have been told that the seals have
[1:31:45] been open we told that there would be a
[1:31:47] body change we've been told that there'd
[1:31:49] be all these great signs and wonders
[1:31:53] where are they
[1:31:58] we still wandering in the wilderness
[1:32:00] these 40 years
[1:32:03] wherefore i was grieved with that
[1:32:04] generation
[1:32:06] and said they do alway air they not me
[1:32:12] they do all way air
[1:32:16] god don't air it's our fault
[1:32:19] they do our way air in their heart
[1:32:22] they have they and have not known my
[1:32:24] ways
[1:32:27] they're not paying attention
[1:32:29] look so i swear in my wrath god was mad
[1:32:35] i'm i'm just reading reading the bible
[1:32:38] they shall not enter into my rest they
[1:32:41] shall get a revelation of the son of god
[1:32:44] but they're not going to they're going
[1:32:46] to stop somewhere and they're not going
[1:32:48] to let me do what i want to do
[1:32:53] you say oh bro wait i can't harden my
[1:32:55] heart after i get the new birth yeah you
[1:32:56] can
[1:32:58] yeah you can
[1:33:01] brother brown said
[1:33:02] you grieve the holy spirit
[1:33:04] said he goes out on a limb and waits for
[1:33:06] you to repent
[1:33:07] he don't go out of you and go he's using
[1:33:10] a
[1:33:11] he's using a scene or an allegory
[1:33:13] what does he do he says okay
[1:33:17] go ahead see if you can make it by
[1:33:19] yourself
[1:33:21] the lord just kind of stands over here
[1:33:22] and you know he just kind of said all
[1:33:23] right you'll be back here in a minute
[1:33:25] but go ahead
[1:33:27] right
[1:33:28] you'll be back here in a minute just go
[1:33:29] ahead and you know what that is though
[1:33:30] that's a testimony or that's a test or
[1:33:32] that's a journey
[1:33:34] that we have to take because listen ten
[1:33:37] times
[1:33:38] if we're we're typing
[1:33:40] the children of israel versus us ten
[1:33:43] times god took them out of trouble
[1:33:45] fed them watered them clothed them
[1:33:50] them and babied them
[1:33:53] babied them was the problem
[1:33:57] they don't then they got to where they
[1:33:59] didn't want the baby stuff no more but
[1:34:01] they didn't want to grow no more they
[1:34:02] wanted to go back to egypt
[1:34:06] hello they wanted to go back this is
[1:34:09] much better sitting in a baptist church
[1:34:11] where i can wear whatever i want to
[1:34:22] it's not bad looking like the world
[1:34:25] they're all good people
[1:34:28] they're all good and dead if they're not
[1:34:30] born again
[1:34:31] you look at all this flesh walking
[1:34:33] around on this earth brother brown said
[1:34:34] cannon fodder they will be ashes
[1:34:37] under the soles of your feet
[1:34:41] why
[1:34:41] because you made a choice
[1:34:44] you took the way with the lord's
[1:34:45] despised view
[1:34:48] everybody with me
[1:34:50] just for a second we're going to close
[1:34:51] right here we're going to read them
[1:34:53] verse 12.
[1:34:55] take heed brethren
[1:34:56] lest there be in any of you an evil
[1:35:00] heart
[1:35:01] of unbelief
[1:35:03] oh bro wait i don't have no unbelief in
[1:35:05] my heart well there's the first one
[1:35:07] because you just lied
[1:35:09] and that's an evil spirit
[1:35:11] hello somebody let's just get face to
[1:35:13] face
[1:35:14] all right
[1:35:15] we're going to do some face timing today
[1:35:18] all right
[1:35:20] i'm just telling you what
[1:35:21] paul is telling us take heed brethren
[1:35:23] unless there be any of you an evil heart
[1:35:26] of unbelief
[1:35:27] in departing from the living god
[1:35:30] but exhort one another daily
[1:35:34] while it is called today
[1:35:36] you say well i don't call everybody
[1:35:37] listen if you listen to sermons if you
[1:35:40] listen to tapes or from church or
[1:35:42] wherever you're communing with god and
[1:35:44] you're communing with your brethren okay
[1:35:46] you don't have to get together with
[1:35:48] everybody and you know
[1:35:50] be face to face with them you're
[1:35:52] communing with god but you're exhorting
[1:35:54] one another daily while it is still
[1:35:56] called today lest any of you be hardened
[1:35:59] through the deceitfulness of satan you
[1:36:02] can be hardened
[1:36:04] don't think you can't even after the new
[1:36:06] birth you say no i've gotta now listen
[1:36:09] be careful the bible gives you a heart
[1:36:11] of flesh
[1:36:15] it's not this thing
[1:36:20] it's an allegory
[1:36:21] that your heart's hard
[1:36:23] before the new birth and then when when
[1:36:25] god comes in he softens you up
[1:36:28] but remember you still got a spirit
[1:36:30] realm that wraps around that soul
[1:36:33] that you can harden
[1:36:36] hello you can harden and not let god do
[1:36:39] his work
[1:36:41] for we are made
[1:36:42] partakers of christ
[1:36:45] if
[1:36:47] if we hold the beginning of our
[1:36:51] confidence
[1:36:55] steadfast to what
[1:36:58] there's that word again unto the end
[1:37:00] steadfast
[1:37:02] paul is telling us look you're going to
[1:37:05] have problems but there is a stature
[1:37:07] that you're going to have to come to
[1:37:10] that you're going to have to suffer to
[1:37:12] reign you're going to have to do the
[1:37:14] things sometimes that your own self does
[1:37:17] not want to do
[1:37:24] but
[1:37:26] we'll start right there this afternoon
[1:37:28] but let me ask you a question
[1:37:32] because we're going to
[1:37:34] we're going to read down here in hebrews
[1:37:36] 5 and different ones talking about
[1:37:37] exercising
[1:37:39] and by reason of use
[1:37:42] oh it's not bad to go out and exercise
[1:37:44] your real muscles but what about your
[1:37:45] spiritual muscles
[1:37:47] musicians come
[1:37:49] what about your spiritual muscles
[1:37:56] what about eating good food
[1:37:59] food is good for you
[1:38:02] and truly as we'll talk about this
[1:38:04] afternoon
[1:38:05] when you're first born again the bible
[1:38:07] says you desire
[1:38:08] the sincere milk of the word you desire
[1:38:11] that that's what you desire because man
[1:38:14] you get somebody on fire from god that
[1:38:16] just got born again
[1:38:18] truly born again they just they'll soak
[1:38:20] it up it doesn't matter if it's milk it
[1:38:21] doesn't matter it's just so good
[1:38:23] it's so wonderful but paul says we need
[1:38:26] to leave that
[1:38:27] not leave it as far as well we don't
[1:38:29] want to do that no more no you take that
[1:38:31] with you
[1:38:34] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[1:38:36] of christ let us go on and to perfection
[1:38:39] and that's what we're looking at
[1:38:40] perfection and we can let's stand our
[1:38:42] feet we can come to perfection
[1:38:45] it's not an impossible listen
[1:38:47] i'm going to say this and say it the way
[1:38:49] i want to say it it was impossible
[1:38:52] for paul's group to come to
[1:38:55] the headstone perfection
[1:39:01] it was there for them
[1:39:04] but because of the
[1:39:06] word they had
[1:39:08] it was impossible
[1:39:09] for them to reach the headstone
[1:39:12] it was impossible for irenas all the
[1:39:14] great ones martin columba
[1:39:16] luther wesley
[1:39:18] pentecost it was impossible
[1:39:20] as we say impossible nothing's
[1:39:22] impossible to god
[1:39:24] but the way he put the plan out is that
[1:39:26] he wanted to wrap it all up with me and
[1:39:28] you
[1:39:30] he wanted me and you that have all the
[1:39:32] knowledge that we have even though it
[1:39:34] may be not worldly knowledge but
[1:39:36] knowledge and information all this that
[1:39:37] we have
[1:39:39] at our disposal to where we can read
[1:39:42] quotes instantly instead of having like
[1:39:43] dad had to do you had to shuffle through
[1:39:45] the whole 1100 sermons and find the
[1:39:46] right sermon that you thought he might
[1:39:48] have said it in
[1:39:51] that's why he wrote it on
[1:39:52] on top of the book but now see we can
[1:39:55] just
[1:39:57] punch a button
[1:39:58] there's what we need
[1:40:01] sometimes that's good sometimes that's
[1:40:02] bad but if you use it good it's really
[1:40:04] good to have that material and that
[1:40:06] ammunition to fight with
[1:40:09] paul says we which are alive and remain
[1:40:11] to the coming of the lord shall not
[1:40:12] prevent her into those which are asleep
[1:40:14] he he he probably maybe inside of him he
[1:40:17] thought man
[1:40:18] maybe it's going to happen but remember
[1:40:20] brother brown said paul was trying to
[1:40:22] get the people
[1:40:23] out of their mind that the resurrection
[1:40:25] was going to happen right then
[1:40:27] paul knew there was a journey paul knew
[1:40:29] that especially john
[1:40:32] john absolutely knew that there was a
[1:40:34] future church
[1:40:37] because he saw it
[1:40:38] he saw it all the way to the future home
[1:40:40] so he knew there was he knew there was
[1:40:42] more to come he knew that god wasn't
[1:40:44] coming in that day
[1:40:46] he was coming in another day
[1:40:49] in revelations 10 1 he saw a mighty
[1:40:50] angel come down he knew that that would
[1:40:52] happen when the seventh angel began to
[1:40:54] sound his message
[1:40:56] but listen folks are we like paul and
[1:40:58] john
[1:41:01] wanting to write another book of
[1:41:02] revelation saying well lord there's
[1:41:03] another one coming there's seven more
[1:41:05] coming there's seven other church ages
[1:41:07] there's all this coming no
[1:41:10] it's right here in front of our nose
[1:41:13] we're getting ready to fulfill
[1:41:15] every bit of that
[1:41:16] bible every bit of it we're getting
[1:41:18] ready to fulfill it are we ready though
[1:41:22] are we ready to fulfill it are we just
[1:41:23] going to go right on and and you know
[1:41:25] we're in the message hallelujah praise
[1:41:27] the lord
[1:41:28] i got my i got my 20-year pen my 30-year
[1:41:31] pen
[1:41:32] my 50-year pen
[1:41:34] remember they give you that at work you
[1:41:35] know they give you a 20-year pen or a
[1:41:37] 10-year pen for being there having
[1:41:39] seniority or something ain't no
[1:41:40] seniority in this message
[1:41:43] ain't no seniority you can come in this
[1:41:44] message and be 90 years old and and come
[1:41:47] to the headstone where somebody's been
[1:41:48] in the message and they're 30 years old
[1:41:49] been influenced as a baby
[1:41:51] so god's not a respecter of a person so
