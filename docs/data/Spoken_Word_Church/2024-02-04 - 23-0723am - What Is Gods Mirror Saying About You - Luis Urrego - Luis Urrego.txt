near me I I feel it but when you're near me I feel it too amen do you desire God Amen in that way that that that you know and and you miss it when you're not in his presence amen that's that's how we want to we want to feel God and that's how we want to be around serving him amen praise the Lord Jesus it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning it's good to see each and every one of your smiling faces and uh appreciate you all making it out this morning amen I I want to thank beforehand um uh those that that um um pitched pitched in and helped you know during the time when we were out um brother brother Mike we appreciate you filling in brother brother John we appreciate you all filling in and we just thank you thank each and every one of you for helping out amen we had uh for those who didn't know that we were in Canada a few weeks ago and we had a good trip and uh didn't would didn't go to expect to minister over there I I'd preached at the church over there before but but brother John Dana over there he told me he said uh you know well when you come over here you're always going to preach so so I said well I didn't come to preach but we had a good time in the Lord and we just appreciate it was just really really refreshing and and and so we just thank God thank you for your prayers and also thank you all for everything that you did and making your way out to Tennessee as well like brother Joe said we've been knowing the people over there for a good while some of you here longer than than even us and uh it was just good to to be with them and good to fellowship with them and I think our presence there refreshed them amen to Hope keep moving on amen that's what it's all about this thing's about over amen amen and so it it's not it's not time to put walls that that was back then all right but it's not time to put walls anymore and don't even use the word of God to put walls either amen it's no excuse anymore amen it's time to just amen just Embrace each other because what was what was jesus' last prayer for us in John 17 that we love one another all right he didn't say put walls if they don't agree with you no he said we love one another and and he didn't give conditions he said you love one another and as the time Drawing Near am mean and things are getting Tighter and Tighter you squeeze you know closer to each other like the cows and and and the cattle out in the field when it when an earthquake is about to happen What do they do they squeeze closer together under under a tree this what we should be doing in this our day but what Satan wants to do is he wants to use the excuse of the word of God this brother doesn't see it the way you see it or this and oh I'm just going to separate them the word is the separator for sure and we separate straightly from from sin amen and deliberate things but if a brother's trying to get to the same Heaven that you are let's see how I can help my brother and let's see how he can help me and we move on closer to God Amen I wholeheartedly believe that with all my heart amen I think that's what works and I think that's what's going to help us move forward amen praise the Lord Jesus Jesus well this morning we just uh want to go ahead and go to the word of God this morning so uh let's just bow our heads as before we read the word our heavenly father we thank you Lord for the opportunity to serve you this morning we realize Lord that we're nothing within ourselves Lord but you are our sufficiency this morning Lord you are our all Lord You Are Everything To Us father you are our life Lord physical and spiritual and so Lord Jesus we we ask you this morning Father that you would just forgive us for our sins and our iniquities Lord we we fail you in many ways Lord in our heart Lord Jesus we desire not to fail you at all we desire the Perfection Lord that your word talks to us about Lord God but Lord Jesus we know that we're perfected in the inside and eventually father this body Lord will catch up to that Lord and so father we're just feeding on your word this morning feasting on upon it pray Lord that you would bless us as your word Goes Forth meet every need amongst us and Lord help us to draw closer to you Lord be with brother Dale Lord continue to strengthen our brother Lord our father he's he's labored many years father God and Lord Jesus I pray Lord that you would just help him Lord in this hour of need Lord and just thank you Lord for for the touch that you've already given him Lord and we just confess it father God that it's going to be a further a further touch Lord Jesus watch over brother Wade and brother Dale and and and the family Lord as they're out right now just keep them safe on the roads Lord and we just commit ourselves now into your hands in this service in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen this morning let's turn to James chapter 1 James chapter 1 and uh and I want to I want to title this uh what is God's mirror saying about you that's a question mark what is God's mirror saying about you not what it said or what it will say but what is it saying now because the the mirror of God Amen as we should be it should be active it's an active word it's a living word amen and it's and it and it's and it's constantly telling us where we're faltering and where we're not we'll we we'll get to it amen but be ye doers James chapter 1 verse 22 verse uh to 25 but be doers of the word and not hearers only that's CLE clear it's clear like the mirror be ye doers of the word and not hearers only it's a hard thing sometimes amen especially when the brother or the sister is telling you saying something to you just getting on your nerves it's hard like what brother Bob was talking about this morning I want to get angry but that's not going to it's not going to make anything better right you pray for the brother pray for the sister watch what the Bible says here but be you doers of the word and not hear is only deceiving your own selves you deceive your own selves when you do that when you just when you when you don't put the word into action for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass and that is a mirror for he behold himself in other words he looks at himself quickly notice that it's using the the the he because a a man he he kind of does that but a woman she stays in the mirror good a good [Laughter] bit she she she makes sure that that she she takes care of you know of her look and some man too but uh but he beholdeth himself and he go and goeth his way and straight way for forgets what manner of man he was or in other words what image he just now looked at you see but who so but watch what he says here but but who so lookth into the perfect mirror or the law of Liberty and and not just looks but watch what it says and continueth therein all right that's key and continueth therein he being not a forg ful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed amen so this morning Saints I just want to this is I I want to talk about this this morning and I want to I want to challenge you all this morning I want to talk about the mirror of God Amen I going to put this right here as a as an example for hopefully it doesn't fall the mirror of God Amen what does the mirror say about you amen when you look at it amen you may have your seats this morning it's so good to have the maronas back this this morning Sarah we missed you we missed David and we missed sister Anna and we miss Brother Anderson too amen no we certainly you all we all thought about you all and we're like my when are they going to get back cuz we miss when the family of God isn't isn't all of us are here amen you all are just as much family as closer than than even natural family is amen praise God cuz we you're the ones who we're going to live in eternity with so you should be excited to see one another amen amen but what does the mirror of God say about about you amen Amen brother Brandon would say like this he says this in the message of identification and that's what we want to look at tonight or this morning I want to look at me and I want you to look at yourself and as we look into God's Great mirror of his word so that's what the mirror is is his word amen let our be able to identify ourselves amen with some that we're going to speak about some of the characters of of other times and I want to see myself in God's looking glass cuz if anything will show you where you're standing if anything will show you where you're standing it's this book amen there's no book like it there's no book like it cuz it is all truth amen I don't say that other books are not true but I know this one's true it's all truth because it's the word of God Amen so first of all we have to establish that this word is all truth amen and if and if you don't believe that the word of God is true and or some things are true and some things amen there's a problem right there the mirror of God can't help you then there's cracks in the mirror so so so so in some areas you're seeing certain good parts of of yourself but in other areas it's cracked and a cracked mirror can't help you when you're looking at a mirror amen when you're looking at the word of God in a in a in a perverted way I believe this but I don't know about this I can't I I'll apply this in my life cuz it's easy but I can't apply this in my life amen you are looking at at God's word as if it's cracked and you think that that is helping you but in reality it's not giving you the Perfect Image or the perfect solution for you to take action upon God's word you see what I'm saying because as we're going to talk about here in just a moment amen when you look at a mirror amen it puts you into action come on and that's what James is talking about here amen when we look into the mirror of God Amen it's supposed to put us into action to do something yes sir to do something about it and not just looking at it or just hearing it but to do something about it amen and that's the problem that that we that we have amen is that we don't put the word of God into action we we are good Sunday and Wednesday Christians but not good during the week to put what we heard on Wednesday and Sunday into action amen that's you amen taking that mirror with you everywhere you go I'm putting this I want to make oh I'm going facing this situation let's see what the mirror of God says amen and then I'm put it into action amen I'm going I'm walking I'm going to work let's see what the grun to situation amen let's see what the mirror of God says amen every single moment you at amen you're always got the mirror before you [Laughter] right praise the Lord I don't want to embarrass Natalia too much we'll go over to [Laughter] Michael praise God the mirror of God it never lies it always tells the truth ain't that right Zach it always tells the truth amen amen so what is a mirror well we see what a mirror is but a definition of a mirror is a piece of glass that reflects images mean something that shows what another thing is like in a very clear and Accurate Way amen it's very scary if I looked in this mirror and I saw someone else that's right man I looked at myself and then I see Zach in the mirror the world what's going on that's kind of creepy actually or some other image kind of like when in the movie Snow White you know when the wicked witch was looking in the mirror and she would see that that image there that face it wasn't her but the mirror was talking back to her amen it would be scary amen but when you look remember the mirror is like is the word of God when you look into to the word of God Amen you're supposed it's supposed to reflect light on you because it is light and then you can see yourself as you're looking into it is exposing every single thing in your life that is not supposed to be there yes amen amen we have mirrors amen for example there there's vanity mirrors that have lights uh light around it it's Shining Light and then it so that you can see yourself better so that's what that's what the word of God is amen you can't see yourself in a mirror in the darken you can't see yourself in a mirror amen when there is no presence of light there already has to be a presence of light right there for you to be able to see yourself properly in the mirror but that's how some of us is amen we've been we've we' we've seen the light but we don't stay in the mirror long enough in order to to use that light of the word amen to be able to fix ourselves up the way we need to you see spiritually speaking amen amen now so it's it's something that shows another thing like a very clear Accurate Way something that gives a true representation amen a mirror never lies all right and as I said a mirror aen can only act it must reflect the light the mirror reflects light it doesn't it doesn't hold hold in light you see it's Shining Light and it's reflecting light back to you so that you can see yourself and that's how a mirror works now in the in the in Bible times they didn't have mirrors made out of glass and and and and the way we have them now they use mirrors of brass those are the types of mirrors that they used amen and and and and the way James talks about it here is that he the man looks into the into the mirror amen and the way and the way back then that they had to look into the mirror is they had to kind of manipulate the mirror or the or or that brass and manipulate it in a way that that okay right there it looks good I'm getting all the light so that I can see myself and that's what James is talking about amen you take time amen when you're looking in the word of God when you're looking in the message of God Amen you take time in order to see yourself properly amen praise God Amen because this is this is how some of us say man we go we we we take the Christian Life oh my and move on and you got something on your face that you need to clean up you ain't shaved in I don't know how long you you you you for the for for us for the teenagers and you got busted pimple aen that that you busted and you didn't clean up sorry that sounds nasty but that's how some of us we walk spiritually with something on our face a stain on our shirt something on our life and this is what we do oh that's okay the mirror can't help you the mirror is there to show you Amen to the whole time oh look look what I have here oh my then you could it puts you into action right the mirror puts you into action praise God I'm just going to put it right here like that so that it yeah so the word of God Amen supposed to put us into action amen praise God now James when he was talking here to the to the Believers amen he he was talking he wasn't talking to unchristian people he was talking to to Christians he was talking to Believers amen who loved the word of God and and would look into the word of God but something was happening that they were not seeing them their their faults or or or or or themselves properly in order to continue amen properly walking with with with God Amen because he tells them amen in in in James 1 verse 22 he tells he calls them my brethren so there were his brothers they were they were fellow Believers in verse 16 there he sayso not ear my beloved brethren wherefore my beloved Brethren so he wasn't talking about about Sinners out here amen he was talking to Believers amen and believers do that Believers amen don't read the word of God the way they should but you believe but you are not in the word of God sufficient or in the mirror of God in order for you to to to realize that there's something wrong in your life oh I'm okay I've been in this all my life this is what I grew up with Amen in reties something is cankering inside of you amen hate uh uh uh deceit something amen is cankering you but you think you are okay because you haven't spent full time in detail in the word of God because the word of God exposes all those things right amen and sometimes he does it through a preacher and just like the wicked witch Amen in in Snow White amen she was fine she was just fine when when when when the miror was telling her she was the most beautiful amen where she would say mirror mirror on the wall who's the fairest of them all you are oh I like that I like it when the preacher tells me I'm I'm doing good and you are the bride and and and oh we're we're going to make it and all those good things amen come on because the the preacher amen should be using the mirror of God right amen shining that mirror upon you right that's right amen is that Michael said I'm showing you amen what the mirror say shows right I'm not I'm not altering the image at all or anything I'm just showing you what who you are but why should you get mad that's you sorry the mirror of God the word of God I'm we're just preaching amen what's wrong with you if it's the word of God that's right but you get mad then the problem is you and it's not the preacher's fault oh it's it's it's it's that brother and that sister's fault amen that that that my kids started going the way they are no it's it's the problem might be with you you as the parent amen it's the problem of such and such family amen in the church amen no the problem can't be with you well that preacher amen steps on my toes too much no the problem can be with you amen the word of God is clear it's it's it's it's a mirror amen look at yourself in it amen the problem is we don't look we stand we spend too much time at making sure that other people are looking in their mirrors and you don't look at yourself in your own [Music] mirror that mirror over there looks better and I hope he's looking at it brother Jonathan I hope you're looking in the mirror Hallelujah cuz he's got some problems I I don't or or S vice versa I hope he gets that taken care of in his life amen what about your problems oh I grew up in the message I've been in the mess 40 years amen you got problems spiritual problems thinking about the brother that way yes sir oh come on now right on but you see we don't think about ourselves because in that way because hey we're under a cover of the church we're under cover of the the ministry at the church and and we don't think that nothing is wrong with and in reality it's all wrong you just don't see yourself see a a a a liar doesn't think he's a liar that's right a cheater doesn't think he's a cheater a a gossiper doesn't think he's a he's he's a gossiper a backbiter a long tongue person doesn't think that they're a long Tong person it's when something or someone exposes it it's when they realize hopefully cuz sometimes amen you expose it and they still don't what are you talking about oh you must be talking about him amen I want to look in the mirror of God and I if the preaching amen is stumping on my toes that I need Band-Aids on every single toe amen God so be it I want it amen cuz I want to get out of here and I know that that's your desire too praise the Lord sometimes preaching can't be soft sometimes it is we need it hard especially if the minister or the pastor amen is seeing something amen he knows his Sheep amen well and that's what a true Shepherd does amen he looks at his sheep and he says wa all right this person in their life now you're not going to preach against just that one person in a whole sermon amen you use wisdom amen but he knows the needs of his sheep and he's going to use not his opinions or his or his or his own thing Amen to try to hit that hit that brother or sister he's going to use the word that's right the word is the expository the word is the mirror right praise the Lord Jesus so these Believers amen they were they they they love the word they have heard the word they have seen the light but they were not put in the light the light wasn't putting them into action Hallelujah and that's the problem with us in this hour amen we don't put the light of God Amen we don't put the word of God into action amen now the word activate amen and it means this amen make make something active or operative or in other words to turn on Amen uh or or to operate or to start Amen to start up to trigger to get going to set in motion amen that is what the word activate means amen and when when we look into the word of God Amen and we don't put it into action amen that is not you activating the word of God Amen you read the promise you saw the promise you looked in the mirror amen but it wasn't sufficient enough to put you into action this morning when I got up amen and and I went to the mirror it was terrible by the way but I went to the mirror and and I looked and I saw that I needed to take care you know my my beard was a little bit grown out and I said you know I don't want to go behind the pulpit with that with that Scruff you know so what did I do it put me into action and I started Shak and started and and the and the whole time I'm looking in the mirror amen it it it it's showing me where I need to where I need to shave what areas I oh I'm missing here oh I'm going look right here but the mirror is showing me the whole time and we don't spend enough time in the word of God Amen to do that oh it's sufficient that I just did a little five minute devotional in the morning that's all right it's okay but but you only shaved half of your face you still got a bunch of right here for us men or you sisters amen didn't fix your hairs you only fix one side of it but the other side still that's how we do with a five minute devotional with a two-minute prayer on Amen but when you spend time and I'm talking about you're you're you're you're not leaving there until you until you get results you're not leaving the mirror amen some of us amen we don't leave the mirror until I I look the way I need to look amen that's how we should treat the word of God you ain't leaving the word of God Amen I'm not leaving this example amen until I'm I'm reflecting the image of Jesus Christ until I look exactly like Jesus amen amen that's how we should take the word of God praise God Amen brother brand says this he says now he could reveal some things to you this is striking right here says he could reveal some things to you and if you don't believe it it will never be active in your life you have have to believe it now think of of Peter for example Peter had he he was asked who do you say that I the son of man am by Jesus himself and Peter what is his reply Peter replies Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God that was a revelation to Peter but it wasn't sufficient active in order to he still denied him it was enough Revelation that he had it was exactly what brother Brown said here now you he could God could reveal something to you but if you don't believe it you're not it's not going to be active in your life it wasn't sufficient enough Amen to give Peter amen uh H uh the the strength to not deny Jesus but he had a revelation I'm afraid that some of us that's how we walk I go to church I've been revealed I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I got enough Revelation Amen to take me to church to to uh to to do something in the church amen but the word of God Amen that Revelation isn't putting you into action and that's our problem amen we need to put the word of God into action not be what hearers only but doers of the word of God Amen you have to take God at his word just like Mary did when she the angel met her and said your going to have a child knowing no man that's what Mary did there was no example of that in the Bible so she could ask the question L uh uh uh how can this be be seeing that I know not a man because it never had happened before right now she didn't wait till she was positive she didn't wait till she seen the signs of it they didn't wait till she felt like or something no no just a quick as the as quick as the angel said it she went to rejoicing and happy telling everybody I'm going to have a baby not knowing any man defying nature see why she didn't wait till any evidence she didn't wait till she was sure like we do that little afraid she didn't wait I'm going to make sure that I understand everything about water baptism before I go get baptized I I I want to make sure that I understand everything there is to understand about being born again and and I want to make sure that I get this out of my life first before I start going to church or living right or whatever put XYZ no as soon as you hear it and you know it's truth take action put it to action because that activates that promise in your life amen that activates that word into your life amen praise God that mirror can't help you amen I I if if you don't put into action what you're seeing amen praise the Lord Jesus activate the promises of God in that way amen the word of God says I am healed amen the In this passage amen I don't feel it I'm going to activate it I'm going to believe it and put it into action I'm confessing am as the song goes I'm confessing and believing and receiving what Jesus said amen that's how we put it into action Mary had no no no no proof of that only what an angel was telling her amen she said behold the handmade of the Lord and and right up then through the country she went rejoicing telling that she was going to have a baby before any sign of life ever showed it in any way she took God at his word amen that's how we should take God his word amen if the word of God says it I believe it if the mirror of God says it I believe it I'll I'mma put I'mma put it into action amen praise God now we know that a mirror cannot lie amen it always gives a True Image praise God always so we should have more confidence in the word to help us than we should than we do sometimes we we we we we we run into a problem and the last thing we do is go into the word of God the sometimes we run into issues in our life and the last person that we talk to is God we talk to everybody else and we call the pastor and we and we and we we talk to the doctor and we called brother so and so in such and State uh and and let see what God says about it I've been there but God has the the answer to you God's mirror shows you what you need to do God's mirror shows you how you need to tie your tie amen I can tie a tie without looking in the mirror but it sure helps to have a mirror amen you see you can probably get help amen from see from anybody somewhere but if it's not the help of God Amen it's not perfect help Amen brother so and so sister so and so can come and ask you for help what's your opinion about this situation or what can you help me with this amen I can only do so much I don't have the answers to but the word of God does because it's the perfect mirror of God Amen praise the Lord so the word of God is the perfect mirror and it tells it like it is amen tells it like it is we don't like it we don't like it when the mirror tells it like it is that brother's too strong that brother's too too blunt that's what a mirror is a mirror is blunt right especially when you when when when you turn it this way right here look at this the 3x Zoom says 3x right here and when you

how how am I supposed to know if it's true or not well when you don't read it when you don't get close to it you're not going to be able to see if it can help you or not amenallah praise the Lord the Lord amen we were talking about the the witch the Snow White amen that she she was asking to mirror amen mirror mirror on the wall who's the greatest of them all or the prettiest amen and she liked it

way true look in the mirror now cuz Satan he has his tricks up his sleeve amen poison apples all kinds of poisonous things amen he throws at you Amen to try to Mar your image praise God and we see it today he hates the image of God he hates the image of God he hates what God originally created and therefore you see the the Abominations that you see out here in the world Amen man looking like woman

a person that you can't tell if it's a man or a woman it's androgynous and do you see that now more and more and you and and kids are being told that that's okay it's okay to to to not know your identity but but the mirror shows you the right identity the mirror tells you amen the mirror of God tells me that in the beginning God created man and woman that's what that's all the mirror says and the mirror for a long for all your life has told you amen the Mir you look in the mirror and say I'm an Android no the mirror tells you amen you're a man you're a woman yes sir or you're a woman yes sir you're a girl or you're a boy yes sir but it's the world it's Satan his poison apple that comes to your life and tries to blur that into your life amen this this is what Satan does amen right here this is reflecting images right ain't that right Michael you see yourself there you don't it's a it's a mirror though this is what you're supposed to look like this is what you're supposed to look like Zach don't you see it something's wrong with you that's what you're supposed to look like NY Elizabeth you're supposed to look just like that that's what the world tries to tell you that you're supposed to look like a blurred mess but it it's reflecting an image it's reflecting light this is aluminum F by the way and it reflects light in order to keep food warm right at least that's how I think it works but when we sometimes we we get past this point oh no I I'm not going to accept all that stuff that the media tells me the media is shoving down lgbtq plus rqf L ml o p QR s t u v WX Y and Z in my on in my down my throat I don't even know what they even got their own types of flags now and it looks all foggy and dingy it don't look clear like the mirror of God does don't it but but that the media said Fox News and CNN says that it's okay and then sometimes you know we we we don't we don't accept that and we get religious about it so we turn it to the other side it looks a little bit better right sister Kathy you see yourself there a little bit better right better than this side right ain't that right Zoe I can have confidence in that but you know what that's what people do amen they they're just churchgoers they just use religion Amen in their life amen and that's enough that's good enough for me but you're not seeing it's not clear like that I I just just I believe the message I believe God sent a prophet that's all some of us get to and it is not clear that's not does that make you want to live a holy life and clean up yourself amen amen amen which one's better why why take a a substitute when you can have the real yes sir amen there's a there's real mirror out there yes sir you don't have to accept the substitute you don't have to accept anything that the devil amen shoves down your throat amen whatever lie he shoves down your throat amen you don't have to accept it when there's something real as a matter of fact it has 3x zoom in it praise God I hope that makes a little sense hope you don't think well he's just Blasphemous up there holding aluminum foil well it makes the point praise God amen amen we're we're almost done Proverbs 27 27:19 says this as a face is reflected in what so the heart reflects the real person and remember what Jesus said he said amen as the heart as what is in the heart that's what the mouth speaks or in other words I like to take it as whatever is in your heart that's what comes out of you that's what you live out amen Jesus said that amen for the tree is known by this by his fruit and then he says in in in Matthew 12 3 uh 12:34 oh Generation of Vipers how can you being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh whatever you watch whatever you you listen to whatever you feed on whatever you you you consume in your life yes it's what you're going to speak is what you're going to live yes right so there's many mirrors in the in life there's the mirror of of of of of social media yes you're feeding on that and then you're you're living your life amen by that mirror that's what that mirror tells me that I've got to be more like this this that and the other Amen in reality that's all fake there's no reality about that that's a fake mirror and or or the mirror of of I've gotta I've gotta I gotta make money in my life I I I've got to I've got to take care of this business amen and and that's the mirror that you live by money is the thing I got to sustain my family and you don't hardly go to church but but but you're sustaining your family there's a problem there your children will see that that's the mirror that some of us we live by I got to sustain my business the business mirror but the business mirror is only temporary your soul is worth 10,000 worlds your soul amen is more important than your business that's right your kids will see that amen it's whatever you put what what you put before God Amen that's that's your god oh I don't like it he was waving the the the the aluminum foil in front of me I like that when he was doing that but now he's getting a little bit too personal that's what the mirror does what the mirror amen whatever you put before God Amen is your God if you don't think it's important Amen to to to go to church or if you don't think it's important Amen to to read your Bible if you don't think it's important amen then something else is replacing that yes sir amen something else in your life is replacing that so that's your miror that's your standard praise God a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things amen and then evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things amen so it's what you feed on Amen good mirrors always tell the truth amen they always tell us the truth even if we don't like what we see the word of God is a mirror you can rely on yes sir amen how many believe that amen the word the miror the mirror mirror of God is something that you can rely on Amen when when when when you're looking in the mirror Amen in order for that mirror to give a clear picture amen You've Got to Get Close to the Mirror draw an eye unto God and He will draw an eye unto you right amen amen praise the Lord in order for the God's word to give you a clear picture of who you are you have to draw close to it amen and we don't go to the mirror to look at the imperfection of the mirror I hope you don't do that sisters you don't go look at the mirror amen this morning when you got up Amen to look in the mirror to see what's wrong with that mirror I need to that mirror needs to be fixed that that's that's not a holy mirror they telling me something wrong no the mirror doesn't lie you went to the mirror this morning because you're hoping the mirror tells you a truth about yourself that you didn't know before you got to the Mirror right but then once you get to the mirror amen you don't look when we look at the word of God we're not looking for imperfections in the word we're looking for the word to expose our imperfections we're the ones with the imperfections amen the word of God doesn't have any that's right the word of God is perfect sir because he's perfect amen praise the Lord Jesus Amen brother Brown says this that's the way God sees you it ain't what you see your own self it's the way God sees you no man sees himself wrong it's when you look in the mirror of God's word it tells you whether you're wrong or not yes sir but we don't take time to do it so we we don't know that we're wrong or not we think we're right and we live life like we're right and we're we think we're happy and we're everything is just fine and honky Dory but you're wrong because the word of God says you're wrong but now it's up to you Amen to take action in your life yes sir amen praise God Jesus amen he gave us the the the perfect example of what we ought to be looking at amen when he reflected his life amen through US amen when he came here on Earth amen he said I only do that what the father shows me amen I only do I'm only going to live out what the mirror amen tells me amen because he was just as much human as he was God so he was more concerned about what God's mirror said to to do what God's mirror said than than his own opinion amen praise God Amen so let's read here real quick amen because sometimes sometimes the mirror of God Amen tells us amen that we are a a certain way and and and and it's the mirror of God Amen is pulling for us or it's rooting for us but we don't accept it because we're we feel so downtrodden down in life and so depressed I'm never going to get out of this this mode in my life I'm I'm just like this I can't change but the word of God says something different about you a a and sometimes we don't we don't take action Amen to fix the things that are wrong in our life but yet we don't take action sometimes to see what God is really is rooting for you and you're the one who's who's trotting yourself down right amen you take for example the children of Israel in numbers amen you can go back back to numbers in Chapter 13 and you read there and this 10 spies were told Amen to go to the to the other to the you know to the land that's flowing with milk and H honey to the promised land and they were to give a report now Caleb and Joshua was one one of those 10 spies and they were looked and they saw that that that there was there was trouble there were giants in the Land There was a u um you know things that they were going to have to confr front and so when they came back to give Moses the report amen eight out of the 10 spies were T were talking and telling Moses we see that it's good we know that the land is good we know that going to church is good and we know that that that living the Christian Life is good but we can't do it brother so and so can sister so and so can Michael can do it but I can't it's exactly what they were telling Moses and and and and watch what they say there there there's something key if you if read if you read in numbers Amen in in in numbers 12:33 or 13 numbers 13 verse verse 33 it says and there we saw the Giants the sons of anch which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers they saw themselves as Grasshoppers and watch and so we were in their sight so however they saw themselves is how they thought that the world was looking at them too you see the way you think you are the way you look at yourself right is the way you think others look at you you use that mirror of your own of your own self that's right of your of your own marred image of your own thing Amen to think that that's how people look at you and that's what was happening amen here in the with the children of Israel but if you go back and read in verse 30 pre previously amen Caleb and Joshua was they were looking at us something different they were looking at a different mirror amen they were looking at the promise of the mirror of God Amen the mirror of the promise of God that said that I'm going to give you this land he didn't say how they were going to do it or what they were going to do or the details of it he just said I give it to you just go and possess it yes it's yours you are you are you have joy in your life the Holy Ghost is yours healing is is yours amen all these benefits of the word amen they're yours but it's up to you to go and take them amen amen and that was their testimony amen Caleb says this he says this in verse 30 he says when they were there in in the previous verses they were there talking talking uh uh uh uh uh uh unbel belief they got the Revelation but they were talking unbelief and Caleb stealed the people before Moses still the people shut up be quiet that's not according to the promise he still the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it amen yes for we we not just him but we are well able to overcome it how did he know that he was only seeing the promise the promise of God said that we can that we're going to right all the way back from Abraham and that's what Caleb and Joshua was looking at amen but the Devil comes in with that poison apple and says you're a depressed person you need medication in your life you need all kind at 15 you need medication something's wrong Satan's Satan's giving you three four five six poison apples then cuz I mean it's sad to see that our young people nowadays they battle these mind battles Satan's really giving out these poison mind apples Amen in their life and some of us as adults we just kind of stand around and just oh they'll figure it out themselves no that's right we try to draw them amen closer to the mirror of God that that can help them ultimately it's up to them to make the decision it's up to you it's up to you young people Amen to get out of the ruts that you're in we can only take you up to a certain point but it's up to you to make that decision yourself what are you going to do with your life are you going to just stay right there or are you just going to are you going to move on with God Amen there's too much of God Amen for me to just stay where I am in my rut or in my or in my in my depressed state amen you know if God if if if if you have a desire to have a family amen then you've got to get out of that place that you're in that depressed mode or that that mode that you're in amen you've got to you want to you want to make something out of yourself you want to help others in life you've got to help yourself the word of God Amen gives you the the the the the the the the the uh the the medicine amen no excuse in this hour Caleb didn't Caleb wasn't looking at that amen he was looking at let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the man that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and then when you reading the next next chapter amen uh in the next chapter after Caleb and Joshua are trying to rule the tell the people we are able to come on let's go we can make it we're looking at the promise amen and that's what we are doing Amen in this hour amen uh us as ministers Amen in this hour you're you we are trying to root you Amen to keep going we keep moving forward amen the promise is yours just go and possess it it's it's laying in the word already it's it's you you see it but now go and take action go do something about it amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so skip skip some of this here for the sake of time amen 2 Corinthians 3:18 tells us but we all with open face beholden as in a glass or a mirror the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord amen we're going to be changed into that image amen of the Jesus Christ the more we look at Jesus Christ we're going to be looking more like him amen one of the examples that I like amen is when was when David sinned amen and and and he uh Nathan the prophet amen came to him and and exposed his sin pulled a mirror right in front of him and told it to him just like it like it is because he had to God had told him to go tell David what he had done I'm not pleased with but yet he thinks he's still okay he because he's a king and he's got a position and he's okay amen I'm not pleased with that so the preacher came to David and preached on him told him a thing or two according to the word of God and you know what God calls David after he he was a murderer he was an adulterer he he did with the things he did God calls David a man after my own heart you know why because immediately when David heard his sin and he immediately he he knew that that was the man that Nathan the prophet was talking about he said I have sinned he said I'm not I'm he immediately went to go to repentance mode amen and you see his repentance his repentance in Psalms chapter 5152 somewhere around there amen David was with with tears repenting I mean he wasn't even eating he wasn't he was really sorry for what he did and but yet Nathan the prophet calls tells tells God tells Nathan the prophet to tell David that tell him that I have already forgiven his sin even before David actually went to the actual Act of re repenting because he knew David was going to do that Amen in verse in 2 Samuel 12:13 and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also hath put away thy sin Thou shalt not die so God lied or or he didn't God had already in his mind already forgiven David because he knew what David was going to do see God lives in in time frames amen he doesn't live in time he lives in a different way than than we live you see he knew David's heart amen what what do you you do when someone exposes something in your life and it's the truth well it's the truth but I don't like the way she said that I don't like the way he said it but he just came to the word he he said it to you with the word I still don't like it who is he or she to tell me that I've been in this church 40 50 years there's a problem with you then it's not a problem with the word and it's not a problem with the preacher the problem is you Amen brother Brandon said this look at yourself just imagine let's stand to our feet look at yourself let the musicians come look at yourself just imagine a mirror before you you're looking at yourself watch am I honest am I honest am I sincere do I really in my heart heart do I serve the Lord ask yourself those questions do I really in my heart serve the Lord because remember amen whatever's in your heart that's what's going to come out so if it's contrary to the word then that shows that you're not serving the lord amen do I really in my heart do I serve the Lord say I serve it look in you women with with bobbed hair wear shorts look at you that does these things look look at you man who let your wife just to just to say I am I a Son of God or am I a sodomite oh that's pretty strong and you women say am I really a modern woman or am I some anti deluvian something that Jesus said would be here in the last days again think it over brother brand says look at yourself see see your own being expresses what you are and if you're not right will you be honest enough to just just to be honest now amen amen you don't have to come up front you don't have to do anything but there in your seat ask yourself that question am I truly living an honest life or am I deceiving myself as James said I'm only just I only come to church and I hear the word but I don't go out and practice it I I I could be the right first one I'll raise my hand I've got to do more than more more about that amen God help us I think we we we all we all need to amen so so what is the mirror of God saying about you amen I hope I hope this helps you this morning let's just bow our heads before we sing a song our heavenly father we thank you once again for the opportunity to have opened back the pages of your word word we pray Lord that something was said Lord that that would help the people strengthen them Lord Jesus and father God help us to be constant father in your in your mirror Lord looking at ourselves
