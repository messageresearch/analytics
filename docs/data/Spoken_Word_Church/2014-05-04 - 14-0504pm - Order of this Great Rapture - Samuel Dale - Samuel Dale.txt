compliment a while ago but brother told me he said i really enjoy that music you make in this church the songs we sing i do too amen we're going back to c we're going to 246. i believe it's uh number 43 in this powerful we'll see jesus has a table spread where the saints of god he all all the time satisfies you may be is all the time hungry literally would just change over sir amen hallelujah amen amen open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart how do you want to see him in the light of your glory pour out your power and love holy holy shining in the light of your glory holy holy holy holy holy amen and amen and amen i want to see you amen that's my desires it's yours good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you like turn in your scriptures turn back where we read this morning from first thessalonians four and try to discontinue our thought on through remember now the minister's meeting will be this coming saturday at brother gerald hughes so wadename's going waiting brother bob remember the fellowship meeting will be here on the third saturday now and we don't know for yet about brother uh or brother vernon brother ernie's going to get to be with us or not but just remember and pray for that the lord would bless him maybe we'll know pretty quick all right remember anna she's real sick with sinuses i called her and talked to her and the doctor gave her i think she said three shots and a whole bunch of stuff so it must have been in bad right and then two now you know we'll talk about mother's day this coming sunday will be mother's day all right in case y'all were all wondering about getting a mother's day but it will be this coming sunday and i will say it this way and no more uh there might be some surprises to you sisters this coming mother's day might be a surprise so you know the brothers there always get together at father's day and we go for a fishing trip and we have a good time but you know might be a surprise okay all right let's see all the announcements first thessalonians i was sitting there thinking while ago and and brother uh dale roberts came on my mind and uh you know they view us on the internet and uh i thought brother dale's sitting there this this afternoon grinning saying what is he gonna come up with next so brother dale hang on we might come up with something all right but you know i'm sure the internet people they get a kick out of it we which one sister used to say you know uh no brother dale in his ways of doing but uh i'm not quite as well known yet as brother forney of the wowzy wowzy woo you know that's that's his way of bringing it okay but remember these things pray one for another prayer the lord would open our understanding because that's our desire right first thessalonians 4. heavenly father we thank you for your love and your grace and your guidance and thank you for you lord and we just pray that you would just bless each other and everyone bless us here in the service lord and bless those who would view the services out there and we pray that there'd be some way that we could help someone because that's all the desire we have in our heart is to try to be a help we know we have an odd way of being and very um maybe an unusual way of being a human being and speaking but there's one thing about it the people who here know that we're not trying to pull something over on them not trying to deceive nobody but just trying to be honest and straight and lord the main thing is to try to serve you and to bring what you want us to hear because we believe you forgive our sins lead us now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in jesus name amen first thessalonians 4 for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him remember now what we're saying this morning the resurrection's got to come everybody wants to talk about a rapture that's fine but remember there's got to be a resurrection before there's a rapture that's the order of the events it's got to happen that away all right for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not hinder us he won't prevent them which are asleep because they're waiting on us all right for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first now remember this morning we kept putting our emphasis upon present tense remember paul is prophesying from back there but if paul was here today he wouldn't say for the lord himself shall descend he would be saying the lord has descended all right now remember that for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the divorce of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the iron so shall we ever be with the lord you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word i said i wasn't going to announce it but we did change the temperature all right it was running 69 and everybody says they were freezing to death we've run it up to 71. now you're gonna have to fuss with the ones that are hot so what can we do i threatened to buy everybody a little bitty suit to put on with a little temperature control inside that you could go you know we can't do it so we've been running it at 69 that wasn't too cold what we think but everybody was freezing so now we're going to run it on 71 see what you think about it for a while and all and that you fan uh and new things but you know we we try we we can't have everything in our own way uh you know maybe that's one of them things that i say or do to get people to leave i'm just look i kid i don't want nobody to leave i never have i want everybody if we had to build a 500 capacity place to do we do but my point is if it's some silliness that you've got against me because i don't paint part my hair just right or or some comical thing i say and you want to leave well then you need to leave that's as plain as i can be that's not being hateful or nothing it's just being right all right but let's think about it now review just a second remember what we covered this morning from psalms 27 that the prophet seemingly used a very odd scripture to be talking of the rapture or the catching away and in those scriptures there was no uh really emphasis light upon the uh point of being caught away you know going up or anything it was seemingly that he was speaking of things you know through the psalmist back dire that was present tense to him that's supposed to be present tense with us it's like i said paul if paul was here today he wouldn't say the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout he'd say wake up folks you've already had to shout the voice of the archangel is the lord jesus christ and the trumpet is when we will go away see you know but i emphasize a lot of things that i like for you to think about and then you'll see what i believe about a fifo ministry how that's their job is to break down things to get us to see it but really i would like for you to take the rapture message and sit down and explain some of the things brother branham taught he taught about a voice of an arcane i was talking about a shout voice of an archangel and trumpet but can you really read that to see what those things are because some of the things seemingly are past tense present tense future tense you know but seemingly that he's trying his best to get us to look at what's taking place now a prophet is not to bring you if it's a prophecy paul was speaking there in a prophecy of a future event right but to paul he saw that present tense we were talking about it last night about moses writing the book of genesis well you know what i believe moses saw he saw the literal things that took place in the garden of eden you know the literal act the literal beasts the literal things the literal changing from the the beasts to the serpent you know i believe he saw that i believe naaman saw chariots jostling in the streets running like lightning you know talking about torches and things but he was really looking down and seeing buicks and oldsmobile or something out on the highway running together with the headlights on well see moses when he said that but then when he started to put it into wording it would be the holy spirit would direct his wording as to hide it from the wise and prudent because we read now the genesis account right you know the believers of the message that really believed right around was a prophet and explained we read the genesis account and we don't see apples on a tree right we don't look at just that that we call silliness that other people looks at you know we say we know what happened but it's still written in a way that would hide it but yet they saw it ezekiel saw fire falling down out of the sky and what was he describing nuclear destructions the prophet said he saw uh like horses and and things you know running you know the prophet said he saw israel in journey all right see when a prophet sees something he sees what he sees but he cannot express that as he sees it if he did there wouldn't be no mystery to the word of god so i'm just asking you to read the rapture message and then just sit down and think about well do i really get a sensible understanding do i really get a well the prophet said it well all right it's wonderful but do we see it by revelation we'll get to that in a minute all right but you see in psalms there he used those scriptures it brings everything to a present tense because listen if you and i don't see this message coming to a present tense form to you and i personal then we're a moses at a burning bush asking for god to give us something else because we don't understand what's going on you remember what i said this morning moses said i'm not going when you tell me you're the god of abraham isaac and jacob i want something personal right that was to abraham that was to isaac that was to jacob i want a personal revelation don't you something that i can walk on martin luther challenged the whole world over the just shall live by faith once god revealed that to him until then it wasn't now you go out with a a carnal concept i've heard people explain justification and i thought that wouldn't what happened to me you know i've heard people play explain sanctification you know well i quit this and i quit that well i never did drink did that mean i was always saved you know if sanctification all you know about it is quitting things i thought it was a work of the holy spirit i thought that was the words of the prophet the justification is a work of the holy spirit sanctification is a work of the holy spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit but you know what john wesley taught sanctification as the baptism of the holy spirit you know what in that day it was in luther's day justification was the baptism of the holy ghost of that age because the holy ghost in every age it's not one age with the holy ghost another way not a holy ghost you're changing your god in your ways i'm trying to say to you and i we need something personal how many of you have ever been healed i'm not talking about just delivered over a period of time i'm talking about this something miraculous happened and you were healed you know one minute you didn't have it the next minute you stood there with it and you didn't matter what anybody else said that doctor told me to take my kneecaps off about 30 years ago he'd take one of my kneecaps off i looked at him with a life i said you won't do it he looked back in life he said i'll you'll be back in here well i still got my kneecaps see because i was speaking from something that was real i was not speaking from a uh well i hope i'm healed maybe i'm healed over but the prophet said i'm healed is that what everybody wants something like that i want something personal a god of william branham is fine for william branham but elisha when he said were be the god of elijah was not a questioning it was a simple statement it wasn't questioning where be it was a simple statement that if i come over with elijah he smote it we walked across on dry ground i smiled it we walked back across the same god right he had something personal amen brother branham preached the seals in 1957 i believe that's right now you remember he preached to me he took like not one night he took a whole bunch now but you know what one day those seals was broke and he preached it because it's something personal you remember the quote we were ending with this morning where he said have we heard the voice of god speaking to us through the opening of these seals well they broke the bread around them they broke the bread well that's wonderful if they hadn't broke him you and i wouldn't have it but does that make you have it because you can read it come on the prophet had a revelation i got a revelation he had a revelation the bible always said in matthew 28 to baptize in the name of the father and her son in the holy ghost we went on over in acts and said to baptize the name of jesus christ we was reading the bible see one day that came alive right and you said wait a minute this can't be contrary one to the other right see something coming live in her heart all right you see him in the message claiming brother branham was a prophet fathered it for 40 years now they're trying to show how wrong he was now that ain't even sensible i mean you follow something 40 years and then you turn around try to prove how wrong the man was you understand i'm talking about something personal is god real to you or is he just a concept or a thought or a quote can you put into plain language what you believe i asked a question last night that i've always asked could god take your revelation of one god to israel if you can't your revelation is wrong i don't care how many quotes you guys or what you're talking about if he couldn't take what this bride believes and go to israel that we know he will take what we believe and go to israel not us he'll take this message which is the entire bible and he'll carry it to israel they won't get over there and quote the seals the plagues of ours they'll put it personal from their own revelation but they'll explain to them jews go into the seventh seal and read it they'll explain to them jews you missed it you had to write for sonship and you turned it down now you're in the tribulation because of that rejection but you know what it'll be then it'll be something real it'll be so real to them jews 144 thousand you know what they say what about something so real they say where did you get the nail prints right now is jesus standing there physically no come on your prophet said he don't set his foot on the ground until the millennium all right but he's so much through those two witnesses but wouldn't it be something to take a two lord or a two soul doctrine are these river jordans now that jesus wasn't god to the river jordan you don't never listen to brother branham as i tell them last night brother randall said don't you tell them jews about that trinity he said they'll tell you where it come from you know why they studied it we were in israel the god that was there to us reuben said on our death in school is a bible and we teach our children about the jesus you talk about isn't that something you put a bible on the desk in america and they'll lock you up you see where we've gone to be the heathen and what we're doing forgive me because that just tires me out to think about you and i as human beings and what we've done with the greatest message that has ever been told the complete plan of redemption and the silliness of mankind and what has happened to it well you can't trust the prophet because he says this and then he says that and he said which one's right i say leave it alone you'll find out it'll come together if it didn't he corrected it if it then you ever noticed this quote he said a prophet stands before no one god alone so what'd he say he said leave it alone if you don't understand he said say what i said he said cause i'll be responsible i know i'm as carnal as an old shoe but if somebody could only hear up to 62 with a message and you're brought around them explaining the things they would not be responsible for what he taught later on and you know what they could say the white horse rider is the holy ghost because that's what your prophet said right so it would be on him and nobody can nobody can argue with the prophet who's the dumb idiot would trot heard a man one time said me and bill decided i thought boy me and bill decided do not forgive me but think about it a prophet tries to always get people to see things present tense all right and that's what we should do what good is the god of yesterday well if we never find out where he's at we'll get to him no he's been here all the time but listen he used the scriptures in psalms that would be speaking of present tense and speaks of a rapture then he comes along from that and that's where we got into this morning let's go back read number three again i want you to see that one quote number three which is taken from it's taken from the rapture message he said the word rapture in the bible is not even used at all we just put that word there the bible says caught up being caught up we read here in a second this one which is first thessalonians either human being right or first thessalonians it is the order first thessalonians what it is the order of this great rapture that will take place in the last days what is the order of this great rapture the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of an archangel and a trump right that's the order all right then we know and we're ended up this morning talking about it the shout is the message so the message had already went forth right right at least we ought to realize that the rapture is in process it's in stages of development whatever you want to use your terminologies it's in process and that's what when i saw that 40 something years ago i've tried my best to explain it that we look at the lord descendant is this message this message was the descendant of god which was the prophet's message it wasn't the descendant of william branham the opening of the word are we looking for somebody else to come in to explain this or do we believe the messages already went forth you know what the rapture is in the process as i said this morning the day you got born again go read the future home save me the time of reading all the time when that holy ghost came in you you know what it done it burnt out everything and gave you the life of god you agree in the new birth you know what it done lay claimed on this old boy you're looking at it laid a claim on it that's why i don't believe you're going to get a new body i believe it's this body redeemed all right see because he lay claim on it why would he come and live in this body and say as the bible said that he's pleased to dwell in you oh no that was just about jesus oh in a way in a way you know you remember this morning the mule in a way you know if you don't believe him to be the same today as he's ever been then you've changed your god has changed somewhere yet that prophet preached and always preached one true and living god you agree but it was long in what 62 or right in there somewhere i don't know what exactly i gave them somewhere in the last of this or into the 60s when the lord showed him the rainbow coming down the three coming down and told him that the jehovah the old is the jesus of the new now what did he believe for then i can give you the quotes where he said it he said i used to think that jesus loved me and god hated me until i found out they were the same person right so there was a time he didn't fully understand and he said paul was the only one that understood it well the other disciple didn't believe in a trinity they just didn't believe in the depth of the revelation that paul had that's all i'm trying to get you and i to do read the word study the word you're not going to find the secret of a raps or anything in careers almanac or some newspaper or a playboy magazine or a love story you know but think about it what is the order of the rapture this great order he said he called god the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout we've done her that brother asked me a while ago he said something about where are we in that i said well you've got to remember one thing if somebody knew come in the message today and you could tell them the lord himself shall send them heaven to shout out voice of archangel trump they don't know what in the world are you talking about they know what you said but you know it takes the new birth to know that the shout is the message not a quote from a prophet but a revelation from god but you see you got people then at all different levels so some sitting here are just now beginning to understand there is now knowing that the shout is went forward but you've got others that know that it's a trumpet because this message is a gospel trumpet you see what i'm talking about but think now we are to be caught up by what we're to be caught up by this message above our reasoning our thinking that's true our old doctrines and ideas of what we thought it was and what grandma thought it was you know caught up in something real to us and see being caught up into it then we believe it all right but we believe that the order is that the resurrection has to come now who's going to call the dead from the grave amen i know a lot of doctrines and ideas but somebody is that's right that's right no matter what you think somebody's going to call the dead whether you believe return ministry brother brown's got to do it whether you believe that we are the people and it's going to be in us somebody is going to call the dead from the grave but we're not going out in the cemetery about 1914 you know they said the lord was coming he'd be with the wings and all they went up on the mountain up there and what in the tennessee's and sat down upon that mountain with their wings because he was coming brother branham said i can show you something happened come on but he said not what they thought i mean we'd all go to the graveyard this evening sit out there for two or three weeks starve to death hold him come out of the grave come out the grave come out of the grave come out the grave that ain't gonna bring nobody up but you know what i love about a prophet he said one day he said it's a great chain and he said one day adam were raised and he said he'll reach over touch eve and said the evil raise said she'll reach over and touch abel saith et cetera and brother branham says it whether you want to believe it or not but he says that one of these days those old testament saints are going to raise i believe they already raised well go ahead that's all right ain't going to argue with you i'm just going to quote the prophet he said those old testament saints will raise and we will fall right in line with them going up there's going to be a resurrection but it's not us going out there and hollering and screaming it's when the contact of faith is there when we get to believing what luther taught the truth of it not all the finest you know fault but what he taught the truth when we really believe that that's a connection to luther he's coming out of that grave but you see then we've got to believe it like wesley talk sanctification the truth of it they're coming out of the grave we've got to believe it like the pentecostals with the gifts and the baptism of the holy ghost brother around and said another great prophet came we don't want to him but he said at the end of the age the messenger would come we don't want to quote brother branham because it's contrary to our thoughts if we don't have the revelation they had who's going to bring them from the grave right but you see then we want to look at it it's like something that's a rabbit hat trick or some point that's coming or a pope out of the united states or you know are we here now but we're here now brother ran him back in the 50s did you watch until russia comes down after that oil they've been down there a long time you get a map of israel and look at it and see if the bible's not right when it says israel shall be compassed about of all nations you know what we're one of those nations on one side and russia's on the other one and china's on the other one everything's ready but we're looking for russia to come out to oil and they're already there come on they said in kuwait that we took kuwait because 50 years from then you would need a pipeline to bring oil to america so evidently it means it's going to be cut off somewhere else you don't read but you see church russia coming after that in the united states and don't put us in the rapture remember my point the dead has got to be raised first that's bible let's talk about the dead racing no i want to be i i want to be i want to hear about the rapture all right let's hear about a rapture going to number 11 brother and let's read it this is taken from the rapture message rs6566 but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her come on it's revealed to her that the revelation the true to bright true bride of christ will be waiting for the revelation of the rapture that's what he says now he explains a revelation that's a revelation for revelation is faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to abraham amen that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him now what's he talking about abraham say what the baby right as though it wasn't so now faith that's what faith is is the revelation of god the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body the rapture is a revelation amen the bride will be waiting for the revelation of the rapture that's what he said would our revelation be enough sufficient to go to israel wouldn't it be something to go over there with the people of this message this doctrine without we we believe jesus was god but we don't believe he was god to the river jordan i thought you would look at you and say you catholic but you know what people swear they think that's the revelation will your revelation bring a rapture simple but yet that's deep in it what's deep about me asking a simple question the prophet said the rapture is a revelation to her he said she'd be waiting for the revelation of the rapture now we're supposed to take a trip we've talked about trying to get together again one of these days we took a trip up to jeffersonville years ago and i'd really love to go again with a lot of if you'd like to go you know and you know but we were getting ready to go there was something like 50 of us and we were getting ready to go well you know i cautioned the people where we were going to meet the bus driver and i told him we are not coming to your house and if you're not at park and ride at oakwood at a certain time we're leaving without you you know everybody thinks they're so important they won't leave me this is one oh boy that will when i tell you we're leaving at 10 o'clock we're going to leave at 10 o'clock don't call me 45 minutes down the road and say can you wait on me no you drive what's the matter with that you know what's wrong with it i mean you're waiting for something you're going to take a train you don't go to the bus depot right now what did the prophet mean when he said the bride to be waiting for the revelation to rapture i remember brother moa priest a message 40 something years ago and it struck with me you got to come to a place to be waiting right look right there behind me on that drawing right no rapture in the church ages what your prophet said now you quote him where would you be waiting for a revelation of the rapture all right right there can you say you're waiting you're at the bus depot and you got your ticket in your hand well you're down here playing around in the garbage cans and i don't mean that about statue burger man i'm talking about being down well god will make a way for me like a brother told me one time he quoted brother branham you know brought around and said you've got a question go to put somebody on the pulpit that's a quote the brother said if he wants me to hear at my church he'll send somebody there i said but if he don't choose to do that you might have to go somewhere else if he instructs you to go to the bus depot you need to go to the bus depot right that's right waiting for revelation and you only be waiting when you're connected to faith you're prayed for right does god do it this way sometimes you're prayed for and you believe you're healed right you know sometimes he doesn't bring that to pass right then amen he waits to see whether you got the revelation of it or not right where are you going to be waiting for the revelation of the rapture well i'll go to church when i want to bless god you can't make me go to church all the time watch all this junk started about got to go to church every service we ought to go to church every day now you want to argue that point ain't got no argument so don't stand up and say nothing to me the most important thing is not who's going to be president it's whether or not the word is being preached and if i miss it i might not get it yeah but we got the internet we got the tapes yup and fire can go off and we go on every bit of it right there's never been a discussion in our family of whether we would go into church or not the only time i really remember us having friday saturday sunday services brother moak's scheduled one time and you know where i was at on thursday i was laying in the hospital my back was killing me friday i begged a doctor to let me go home he said i'll let you go home if you'll go home and go to bed i didn't lie to him i just didn't tell him what i was gonna do but it was already pre-planned i come right here with a heating pad and i sit down in a pew on friday night saturday night i had the heat and pad sunday i had a heating pad monday or tuesday tuesday one or two somewhere in there god delivered me there wasn't a choice now when i talk like that people say well you mean we're supposed to come to church when you're sick i thought that was the place we need to come to when we're sick now don't come in with a high temperature cause you can pass your diseases i ain't silly but we do have a back room where do you think he's supposed to be when you're sick but we're ready for a rapture i got one coming after this but right around says we can't have faith for divine healing let alone a rapture don't worry about the rapture until the dead's raised we better work on how to get the dead out of the ground what if it's connected to your revelation what if it's connected to what you believe you see why i believe around the world the ministry of jesus christ is in the bride around the world that don't put it all in lula georgia there's not going to be no more of these prophets come on the scene like brother branham was to be we don't believe in junk but there is a five-fold ministry and in that there is prophets apostles evangelist pastors teachers far to perfecting of the saints how are we supposed to get these virtues to be waiting bless god i get it myself good woman preacher do i need to explain that why don't you say it it's a good warming preacher ain't going to listen to him man i know i shouldn't say what i'm fixing to but it still comes our what about these men preachers that are warming preacher spirit he said what do you mean i mean to take eve's life he was the first woman preacher she's done a good job preaching to the devil until he out preached her and she got caught so you showed me a woman preacher anywhere's ever mounted anything but then i'll go ahead and say it because i don't mind saying it i'd rather listen to a lot of women talk about this message than a lot of preachers that's in this message take that and swallow it that's good dale isn't it he's sitting there laughing because i'd rather see i got a question to ask the preacher that said my wife was a best woman preacher he ever heard of i got a question to ask him i want to know is he being derogatory calling her a woman preacher or is he saying that she's got a greater revelation that most of the preachers has got and she needs to be preaching to him i want to know which one he's saying i will get a chance and ask that question but i do i believe she's got a greater revelation than the biggest portion of these preachers is in the message come on sisters you've got a right to have a revelation too but think about it now revelation going to number 12 and let's just get down to something the prophet's talking about because i quoted this this morning this is paragraph 129 and 130 like 131. rapture from the 13th to 16th verse there is three things that has to happen before the lord himself appears quickly now so we can close see the first thing happens notice a shout out a voice a trumpet let's read it now we'll see that it's right the lord himself 16th verse shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the archangel and the trump of god all right three things happens a voice a shout out voice or trumpet has to happen before jesus appears now shout jesus does all three of them when he's he's he's he's descending he doesn't stutter very much does he wonder if he's emphasizing something right a shout what is a shout it's a message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride three things happens and he does them all three in his descending it's not minding your descending it's not minding your rapture if we get that out of the way we might be able to understand he's not coming after you and me he's coming after himself that he left in you and i right right that's why he's doing it but it's in a process from the day you got born again a growth development started of going up the statue of a perfect man right read the statue of perfect man and see brother branham said these things are a requirement now my point has always been how do we get them how do we get virtual knowledge to emphasis godliness brotherly kind of because faith is not a uh virtue faith is a birth you better go to reading if you think i can't read brother brown says there's seven ads do you need that quote he says there's seven ads i'd like for you to look behind me i hope if zero in on the screen on that and i'd like for you to count there's eight things there faith virtue knowledge tempers patience god in this brotherly kindness holy spirit love you you can even come out count nine if you want to really get into it but he says there's seven ads you don't add faith faith is a birth you add virtue knowledge temperance patience then the holy ghost is the last thing to be added which is love but you see in that then what are we looking for that to be brought into being let me just scan these and we won't have to pull them up on the message of sardis in church age page 256 but around says but you christians rejoice in your being caught up here are the words of your heavenly leader come unto me answer with one voice even so we come we know that noah represented the tribulation saints he doesn't represent the bride he rose up come over went back down to outer drunk he represents the tribulation saints that received you know life he said enoch was a type of the rapture all right enoch the top of the rapture well you know according to the scriptures enoch walked with god and i know it's 360 years or something look around says 500 years that's no problem that's not a contradiction he can't keep his numbers straight but enoch walked with god brother brown said he had rapture and faith but the raps are such a great thing it's so hard it's something we don't understand and yet enoch without the new birth walk with god and was not the bible says because god took him why did god take him why did god take enoch i guess the way part is higher or what he looked like or some great genealogy no read the bible amen said he took him because he had one testimony that he pleased god and he was caught up with me he just walked off the earth you know what enoch was doing at that time was hanging around over there where they was building the ark i mean excuse me building the the pyramid the one she opts it doesn't have a head on it you know and in that is a complete plan of redemption et cetera et cetera and enoch pleased god with rapture and faith your prophet said rapturing revelation how many gods did he believe in it was not because god took him why because he pleased god now if we come up this statue of perfect man correctly true don't you think it's going to be said of us that these these are my beloved sons i'm pleased to dwell what are you getting at brother dale i'm getting at one time it wasn't a great big thing that enoch done you know it was the fact that he could believe god and he walked with him all of his life you mean never done nothing wrong i didn't say that brother branham didn't say that it says about elijah that he was a man of like passion anymore elisha one had a little bit of a temper one in there because he cursed him kids and the she buyers ate them up remember they didn't have the holy ghost back there isn't it odd that enoch could walk off the earth without the holy ghost and we can't even live with it amen amen what is going to be the rapture that's what we're looking at somebody's going to do this somebody's going to do that somebody's going to come and tell us this somebody's going to tell us that somebody's going to do this his brother dean was bringing out the other day you know in one scripture there in the bible if a prophet give you a sign you're supposed to believe him that's good i believe that but you know there's another scripture it says for prophet gives you a sign and the sign comes to pass but he takes you to another god you remember that in the scripture the people of this message are the most gullible group of people that i've ever been associated with what i mean by gullible somebody can come along with some kind of little gift and they just run after it you know oh this is it what we've been waiting on i'm not waiting on but one time i'm waiting on god to reveal to me what to preach next because i believe what i've preached is the truth you know that somebody one day is going to come out and say i'm already changed well you know what most people are going to say get the straight jacket the guy's gone kooky well i thought that we must confess and believe that we're healed before we can be healed that was what i understood i thought that we must confess with our mouth and believe in our heart according to romans before we can be saved remember the scripture there where it says this is that i believe it's in the book of acts right this is that you know what brother ryan said one day he said if this thing that let me keep this so that gets here because he really believed that this was that my point is can you and i see a living god right here today in 2014 are we still looking for something to happen what have we found out is already taking place what have we found out the shouts already went for it what we found out divorce of the archangel is in the bride what if we found out this message has already called us up you know way i talk i'd rather go through life seeking god than to not seek him at all your prophet saw god more and more but yet one day he looked back and he said lord you've done showed me that these things is here and i'm not saying you're coming i'm saying you're here when are we going to say that well when i see when i i when i see the great signs and wonders okay we've seen the dead raised here let's move over to another church where somewhere else and find out what they've seen what if they've seen god move in healings and signs and wonders then let's move to another church and see what they believe we might be looking at something instead of far something that's all i've ever tried to get you to do a god of history will do you no good but revelation will change us right a revelation see we all go up together and even in look at my notes paul said in another place that we'll all be changed right you know the resurrection is going to come and we'll all be changed i don't believe the resurrection's going to come to them they're going to be 80 years old got to be changed back to 20 years old i believe their change will be them coming out of the ground all right but you and i are going to be changed in a moment a twinkling of an eye because of this message i believe that 45 years why quit now i've taught it all these years why stop now i believe jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i believe he's here as brother branham said in every way outside of the corporal body you want that quote be glad to run back a few messages and read it to you if it's hebrews 13 8 what are we going to believe church when are we going to just settle down and say look i believe jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the same god that walked the shores of galilee is right here now but you see when you do that or where's the signs and the wonders well let me quote brother branham they got signs and wonders are we supposed to run after signs and wonders are we supposed to run after the word which is the way but now brother dale when you have the word you'll always have signs and wonders we've seen the dead rays how many pastors can claim that across the land in america today that we've seen the dead raised but you know what people would rather listen to some pastor that has no no doings whatsoever to tell you you know that just gets me i'm sorry it gets me to think about people that we put our whole life upon this message and now that it comes down to the end of it all do we really have everything upon this message i know people in this message their churches has got a swiss bank account why do you need a swiss bank account just in case things don't work out right you got somewhere to go right i got all my eggs and one basket don't do that financially it's not a good advice right don't you lose it all at one time but in the gospel i got it all based on one thing if this message is not right i am the most deceived person there is in the world no matter what they can say about brother branham or whatever they call him or say that he's done the message he brought has brought me to jesus christ amen the god that i saw when i was 11 years old standing in a church he's brought that god to me hallelujah by revelation what can you say that's why i don't have anything else it's not nothing else why would i want anything else he's kept us straight here in lula for 50 years why would we want to worry about anything else we never run after the two souls the two lords the seventh under virgil that proves he is the son of man's the doctrines that all these churches went after well you're just bragging will come and show me where i did father some of it i'll show you the tapes where it didn't because we still got them all from 82 until now how many preachers how many pastors would let you have ten years of their sermons all you gonna do is click on internet you get everyone maybe richard like some being having him put on but you know the biggest fortune comes on the internet you can see what i preached 20 years ago you see when i preached 40 years ago almost how many preachers would do that they don't even take their sermons right but you see i've got an advantage and disadvantage because if i change somewhere you can find a change but i've had people to come to me and say brother dale you said so and so it's okay we go get the tape and we're going to find out whether i said that or not i've got that advantage that i can pull the tape and play it to you and say now you show me where i said it but people don't like you like that they want you to be wishy-washy we're in a day when everybody wants everybody to be bad right just a little bit that way nobody can't say nothing about nobody else because we all got little problems well i'll agree with you we've got plenty of them but i believe god has been honored he's honored his word and he's kept his word he's revealed himself to us to the opening of the word that's all i've ever tried to teach you it doesn't make anything out of me that makes something out of a great god well i just don't like your attitude well good i don't like yours either now what are we doing man does that solve any problems what about the word that's all i care about is the word like i've told you paul had a greater revelation than any of the rest of them right and brother branham had the greatest of all revelations that he had a greater revelation than the apostle paul i believe that but i believe the only one now that could have a greater revelation than brother branham is almighty god the bride's not going to have no greater revelation it's just going to take this revelation that has been delivered unto us rapturing faith lays in this message we quoted it as being in the tapes of books i think that's not correct that way uh brother joe's got it for you if you want it worth laying at raise in this message revealed so what do we need anything else but we need to keep digging there's wonderful nuggets laying in this message that we've only skimmed the surface off great things that are there but remember we can't get anything contrary to what the original brought and i don't care what your great revelation is and i don't care what your signs and wonders are i thought that believers didn't have to have signs i thought science followed the believer i didn't know the believer followed signs okay but a man with a great revelation what about all of the people that was there what about the great peter that opened the door to the gentiles and i mean the jews and into the gentiles all of the things happened we did a man like paul never set in the communion service with the lord jesus right right right but peter and them did why were they not chosen to explain communion you know why because they couldn't understand it they saw it they witnessed it but the apostle paul was chosen let's stand let's go into the communion paul in first corinthians 11 chapter 23rd verse for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said now paul wasn't there when this took place right but yet he's explaining it that's why i love the book of luke luke was not an original disciple not being one of the original disciples but yet he says in the beginning he said having perfect understanding that's right that's something but we ought to live draw peter ought to be the one to explain it no when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take heat this is my body which is broken for you this due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this due years off as you drink it in remembrance of me or as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoe of the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup he that eaters and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged i love this scripture but when we are judged we're chastened to the lord why that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man in hunger let him eat at home did you come not together under condemnation the rest when i said in order when i come like wade was explaining there one time you go back there and you pick up all of those and as smart as i am i didn't know that he was explaining it one night and i sat there and i said lord i didn't ever see that that when they come through and got ready for that last meal they had a part there that when jesus come over and ate the meal with him he turned around and fulfilled what that spoke of and took the bread and blessed it and passed it out he took the wine he all he added to it was this is my body i'm the one that all of this was meant you know that always even the jews today when they have their great meals and their great things of celebration there's a cheer left for elijah they believe elijah will come and precede the coming messiah well that's wonderful that's what i told reuben i said reuben do you believe in the coming of a messiah i just believe that jesus was that messiah i said do you mind if we pray for you he's itching all over i said you mind if we pray for you then we're going to pray for you in the name of the lord jesus christ because we believe he was the messiah he said go ahead the next morning he come walking through the building over to the side i said reuben he said he hadn't been sleeping real good at night he'd been taking like three or four bass to stop the stinging i said reuben you sleep good last night he said all night i said god touched you he said yeah see those jews are not a bunch of idiots they know the scriptures do we know them though what are we just well there's just something happening they just finally thought about having the communion no it's already there what do we think about it the bible said they turned for a moment before they went on into the rest of it so let's just stop for a moment now silent prayer pray one for another the lord bless each and every one of us in his love father we take communion because it was commanded unto us until you come again some people have got so revelated they don't take communion anymore but yet they know you haven't fulfilled your coming just help us lord to see a reality we know this is not your body this is not your blood we understand that it's in symbol form we thank you now just let that symbol become a reality in our hearts and our lives we've seen the sick healed because of the communion that people have taken and we believe you we thank you lord just be with us now and all of us together in jesus name the bible said he took bread and he blessed it father we just ask you to bless this bread it's been made for this purpose today the purpose for us to take communion to honor you and your word and do what you say for us to do we just ask you lord to sanctify the bread and the partakers we know this is not your body it's just in a symbol but what a symbol is to us lord it's close to a reality just help us lord and goddess keep us sanctify the partakers and the bread itself lord in jesus name i always say to you that we thought we had it all figured out didn't not throwing off on no baptist that's just where i come from we used to order communion bread and we'd order a little package of it it was made from unleavened bread but then we'd take it and we'd only take communion about every three months and we'd take it and we'd freeze that bread we're too stingy to go buy another dollar's worth of bread so we take that and we'd put it in the freezer three months later we'd take that bread out and warm it up take the communion and we were so religious until we never believed in drinking wine oh no you know so we'd make it as grape juice and we'd have a little grape juice and that wasn't what jesus said father we thank you for this wine it's going through the process and lord it doesn't rot and then deteriorate it stays we believe you father and we ask you to just help us we know it's not your blood it's only in a symbol we ask you to sanctify the wine if it was the blood if it was the body why would we be asking to sanctify it lord so we ask you to sanctify these things and as we eat the little piece of bread and as we drink the little bit of wine that even tomorrow there'll be blood cells coming from that to help us to be growing in human beings we just ask you to sanctify the wine and the partakers in jesus name amen good morning i walk by the river i'll rest me the ever green tree i'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes i'm despised and rejected and i question oh father how long then i take one more look at mount calvary and it gives me the strength to go on that tree come morning i'll walk by the river i'll rest me the ever green tree i'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me just think about it church what have we been there sitting there and i'm serious to ask you peter was sitting there james john but they never explained to communion you know you know they took it you know they've done but they never explained it and paul was writing a letter you know because that's what his writings were were letters to people and somebody had probably asked him a question and said paul uh this communion you know we we'd like to know a little more about it so he sat down and he started pinning and a lot of things had been told him that it took place and he could write that down but then he could see within his own self what it really was and how that what they were doing back here would come down to here and the prophet said when we get on that other side the marriage supper said it's going to be the communion well we always thought it would be a big porterhouse steak with a this thing or that thing you know we thought it'd be some kind of something the greatest meal that could ever be thought of i told you when we were in israel i'm always the last one to kind of know things and a little dumb you know and a little backward but we had a nice meal before we left israel and uh you know they had a lot of things to eat and then they had some lamb on the shish kebabs well i thought that was the main meal so i ate all of my lamb and i don't remember but i know i looked around to brother dean and sister peggy and maybe to my wife and they didn't eat all of theirs they were smart enough to know we was going to get something else but i didn't and i didn't intend to go home hungry and and i said to them i said the bible says to eat the whole lamb you know so they faced it down and i ate all of their lamb then they brought the main meal out which was a fish about this long about that white i got it down but you see take it off let's eat all the word let's think about all the word right let's protect together you can be seated for a moment and then we'll go into the foot washing think about it what about it john 13. and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas's carrot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to simon peter and peter said unto him lord let's not wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter peter saith unto him that shall never wash my feet see he didn't have an understanding of what was going on right peter said unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i wash thee not now that's no part with me simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head two dirtiest things about us right jesus saith unto him either is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but he's clean ever wit and you're clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you're not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them no you what i've done to you you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for i have given you an example that you should do as i have done to you verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happier ye if you do them let's stand together and the sisters can be dismissed in the basement and the foot washing remember their services wednesday pray one for another lord willing i'll be trying to hold up and preach a little and only just pray that the lord would guide all of us and remember the announcements that we've made we will let you know as quickly as we can about brother ernie if not we're going to have to get someone else to come and minister unto us for the uh fellowship meeting but you know so god will provide somebody so we won't have to worry about it all right father we just commit everything into your hands and your love and your grace we thank you go with us now as the sisters go to have the foot washing and as we brothers remain here and just lord be a servant to one another and show our unboldness and our thoughts of not lord look how humble i am but lord make me humble make me to be what you want me to be blessed and god each one then bless everybody on the way home give a safe journey let your love be with us in jesus name amen you dismissed you
