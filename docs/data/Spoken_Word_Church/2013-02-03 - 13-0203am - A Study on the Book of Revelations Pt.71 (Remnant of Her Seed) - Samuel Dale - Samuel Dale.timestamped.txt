[12:04] everybody in the house of the
[12:06] Lord had a wonderful time last night in
[12:09] the uh Bible study didn't get into a lot
[12:12] but we had a lot of this straight flat
[12:14] discussions and it I think it turned out
[12:17] good you know right to to and all of
[12:20] that and we got by without the weather
[12:21] problem because it did look like it was
[12:24] going to really get rough for a little
[12:26] bit but then it just moved on out you I
[12:29] know everybody was praying and we just
[12:31] asked the Lord to move it out and it
[12:32] just moved out and everything was okay
[12:35] but we appreciate the Lord now remember
[12:38] the I know Terrence has made these
[12:40] announcements but I want to make sure
[12:41] everybody's here remember the banquet on
[12:44] the
[12:45] 16th the Saturday the 16th and remember
[12:48] the announcements you'll be there at 5:
[12:52] and we'll you know we're going to take
[12:56] pictures no later than 6 so if you come
[13:00] and you're not there without a death
[13:03] certificate or a speeding
[13:07] ticket one of the three then you won't
[13:11] get your picture made so don't come in
[13:13] with her feelings you got the rules and
[13:14] the regulations we try to go by all
[13:17] right so just keep that in mind and
[13:19] remember this coming Wednesday is the
[13:21] last day you could be able to sign up so
[13:23] if you don't sign up to be able to go
[13:25] don't come up to a day or two later and
[13:27] say I decided to come forget
[13:29] we're blunt plain you know and so that's
[13:34] all right but hate to be that way all
[13:36] right but remember that uh remember
[13:38] Sister Johnny this morning she would
[13:40] called and was coughing like everything
[13:42] Brother Ray called and said sister Kathy
[13:45] was real sick brother Dean's here this
[13:47] morning sister Peggy's been real sick
[13:50] with the nose bleeding and stuff like
[13:52] that and we were talking with her but we
[13:54] didn't get a chance to go see her cuz
[13:56] she went to the hospital and thank God
[13:58] that she got to that point cuz it could
[14:01] have been bad you know you know we know
[14:03] she passed out and things because you
[14:06] know the doings but yet God is always
[14:09] good to us and doing that all right now
[14:11] when the announcements to be made
[14:14] brother Tom Ernest will be with us on
[14:16] Wednesday the 13th of February so he'll
[14:20] be with us for that Wednesday night
[14:22] service brother Tom Ernest and then
[14:24] brother Claude wisinger will be here
[14:26] with us on March the 10th
[14:29] so remember these two announcement I
[14:31] gave them to brother Joe while I go to
[14:34] announce them and remember that also
[14:36] while you're standing we got an
[14:38] announcement that the uh brother guest
[14:42] and Diner is having the Word of Life
[14:44] Tabernacle their youth banquet and the
[14:47] dates are on here and the things and
[14:49] brother Matt Watkins will be doing the
[14:52] speaking and he gave a special note here
[14:54] and I emphasize the note that he's
[14:57] talking about the the
[15:01] transportation now listen to the wording
[15:04] the transportation to and from the
[15:06] church and activi and loding
[15:09] arrangements are the responsibility of
[15:12] the adults youth leaders bringing them
[15:15] remember to ask for rates not Motel
[15:19] there will only be chaperon and
[15:22] supervision for the Youth at the
[15:25] church not at the hotels like we have
[15:28] had in the previous years and it's a
[15:31] parents Guardian responsibility to be
[15:34] sure you are aware of this information
[15:38] so now I say to you that we will pay for
[15:41] the children to
[15:44] go
[15:46] only if accompanied by an adult
[15:50] right in the motels and taking care of
[15:53] the transportation and your total
[15:55] responsibility of them while they're
[15:57] there right all right and the only way
[15:59] we'll do is for you to go with them a
[16:02] woman with the girls and a man with the
[16:05] boys you're going to have to stay in the
[16:07] room yeah we're making it plain and
[16:10] blunt where it won't be misunderstood
[16:11] we've had problems before sometimes
[16:14] because we didn't blunt it out yeah so
[16:16] this is
[16:17] blunt we will pay for it if you'll do
[16:19] that if you don't you take them yourself
[16:22] right you send them yourself that's your
[16:23] children that's not mine but I'm from
[16:26] the church mhm right it will only be
[16:29] done and paid for if and we're glad to
[16:31] do that but not to where that you won't
[16:35] be Shaffer on because remember you're
[16:37] there representing
[16:39] us and so again now you got to be a
[16:43] woman go and stay in the room right
[16:46] there's got to be a mango and stay in
[16:48] the room with the boys it's got to be
[16:50] right or we will not pay for it and
[16:52] you're going to be
[16:54] responsible and do you realize what
[16:55] responsibility is right
[16:59] if something goes wrong you're held
[17:01] accountable right that's right so if
[17:03] you're willing to accept responsibility
[17:05] and do that's fine right but if not then
[17:08] forget it right you know so then if you
[17:10] want to take your children and go or
[17:13] send them that's your business it's not
[17:15] me but we won't be having nothing to do
[17:18] with those things in that line okay
[17:21] Revelations 1 in Revelations
[17:25] 12 I think we got basically all of the
[17:28] announc ments uh that was to be
[17:31] made is there any other announcement

[19:20] this morning through the opening of the
[19:22] word forgive our sins as we say again
[19:24] and keep us in your love in Jesus name
[19:27] amen amen
[19:29] always we've been reading Revelations 1
[19:33] 1-3 because what is it this book is the
[19:36] revelation of Jesus Christ the entire
[19:39] book from Genesis to Revelation is a
[19:42] revelation of Jesus Christ all right the
[19:45] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[19:47] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[19:49] things which must shortly come to pass
[19:51] he sent and signified it by his Angel
[19:53] unto his servant John who by record of
[19:55] the word of God and the testimony of
[19:57] Jesus Christ and of all things that he
[19:59] saw blessed is he that readeth and they
[20:02] that hear the words of this prophecy and
[20:05] keep those things which are written
[20:06] therein for the time is at hand okay
[20:10] Revelations 12 we will just take over
[20:13] from verse 7 and go through the rest and
[20:16] try to express this of Revelation 7
[20:20] today I mean Revelation
[20:22] 11 verse 7 and there was war in heaven
[20:26] Michael and his angels fought against
[20:28] the dragon and the dragon fult and his
[20:30] angels He Prevail not neither was their
[20:32] place found anymore what there neither
[20:35] was there right not there right there t
[20:41] h e i r right place found anymore in
[20:44] heaven what about that you could remove
[20:47] something so much until he's not even a
[20:48] place right Satan's going to go out one
[20:51] day so far until he's not even a place
[20:53] of remembrance of it amen you know
[20:55] that's something is it thank God Amen
[20:57] all right and the Great Dragon was cast
[20:59] out that old serpent called the devil
[21:01] and Satan which deceiveth the whole
[21:03] world he was cast out into the Earth and
[21:06] his angels were cast out with him and I
[21:08] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[21:10] is come salvation and strength and
[21:13] Kingdom of our God and the power of His
[21:16] Christ for the accuser of our Brethren
[21:18] is cast down which accuses them before
[21:20] our God day and
[21:22] night and they overcame him by the blood
[21:25] of the lamb now watch this in a when we
[21:28] get back to these scriptures and they
[21:30] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[21:32] and by the word of their testimony amen
[21:35] and they love not their lives unto the
[21:37] death therefore Rejoice ye heavens and
[21:40] ye that dwell in them woe to the
[21:43] inhabiters of the earth and of the of
[21:45] the sea for the devil has come down unto
[21:48] you having great wrath because he
[21:50] knoweth that he hath but a short time
[21:52] that's right and when the dragon saw
[21:54] that he was cast into the Earth he
[21:57] persecuted the woman which brought forth
[21:59] The Man Child and the woman was given
[22:01] two wings of a great Eagle that she
[22:04] might fly into the Wilderness into her
[22:06] place where she is nourished for a time
[22:08] and times and half times from the face
[22:11] of The Serpent and the serpent cast out
[22:14] of his mouth water as a flood now
[22:17] remember water's people all right right
[22:20] after the woman that he might cause her
[22:22] to be carried away of the flood and the
[22:25] Earth helped the woman and the Earth
[22:27] opened her mouth and swallowed up the
[22:30] flood which the Dragon cast out of his
[22:33] mouth and the dragon was wroth with the
[22:36] woman and he went to make war with the
[22:38] remnant of her seed which keepeth the
[22:41] Commandments of God and have the
[22:43] testimony of Jesus Christ you may be
[22:46] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[22:49] reading of the word I hope that you're
[22:53] enjoying thoughts and things that we're
[22:55] trying to make on this one sister was
[22:58] saying the other day said you read and
[23:00] you hear what brother Brown says but
[23:02] said then just come along maybe somebody
[23:04] and just say a few
[23:05] words and it will open up that to work
[23:09] that it will give a greater
[23:10] understanding well that's all we're
[23:11] supposed to do you know we're supposed
[23:13] to to be into that now what have we
[23:17] found this is actually the tribulation
[23:22] period we will get back to it in a
[23:24] minute because that's why it gives you
[23:26] the times times and the half times which
[23:28] is 3 and 1/2 years right so basically
[23:30] what we're studying in the Book of
[23:32] Revelations where you're going into we
[23:35] gave the other day 7 8 uh 9 even 10 11
[23:41] and now we're into chapter 12 is dealing
[23:44] with a 3 and 1/2 year period of time to
[23:49] Israel all right now cuz that's why your
[23:53] plagues your vows your trumpets Etc are
[23:56] to Israel and they're happening in that
[23:58] 3 and 1/2 year period And I keep
[24:00] emphasizing because I want you to say it
[24:02] because brother see it brother Brown
[24:04] says that the Daniel of the Old
[24:07] Testament is actually the Book of
[24:09] Revelations of the new all right right
[24:11] amen and in the Book of Daniel and I've
[24:14] asked you to go read it with this
[24:16] understanding you read it and it's a
[24:19] vision Y and then you read again mhm and
[24:23] it seems like something may be
[24:25] different right then you read another
[24:27] and it seemed like something different
[24:29] but if you'll remember it's all just
[24:33] Progressive that's right as is being
[24:36] made known and the travel coming through
[24:39] well so is the Book of Revelations from
[24:41] where we've been here in the the talking
[24:44] about the tribulation period and all of
[24:45] these things that are transpiring it's
[24:48] just in that short period of time but
[24:51] it's unfolding a lot of things that
[24:53] happen you read Revelation 6 and you do
[24:56] not find in Revelation CH 6 it even
[24:59] mentioned
[25:02] 144,000 you know the somebody's alarm
[25:05] going off in the car
[25:08] somebody's car alarm it just went off
[25:11] okay okay somebody hit the right
[25:15] button long as it Ain
[25:18] the but now if it is let them have the
[25:21] car with that uh be like oh what up
[25:25] brother Richards one brother Wood's one
[25:27] time and and I was preaching years ago
[25:29] and and uh all at once a commotion went
[25:33] on the outside you know and the dogs was
[25:36] running and barking I said and everybody
[25:38] just looking around I said keep you
[25:39] seated I said if there's anybody that'd
[25:42] be the blunt Target it'd be me so I'm up
[25:44] here just keep your seat and set there
[25:46] cuz if you go out there you might get in
[25:48] trouble yeah unless somebody had a gun
[25:51] or something go out there to do I said
[25:53] few minutes we'll tell somebody to go
[25:54] see what's going on yeah so it's just
[25:56] sensible things to do do okay but now
[25:59] listen The Book of Daniel then is is
[26:02] doing and remember John is 2 years y
[26:05] That's right on patmas 1895 96 two years
[26:09] writing these things right when anyone
[26:12] with a almost a a third grade education
[26:15] could sit down and write the words of
[26:17] the Book of Revelation in just a matter
[26:20] of a few hours or something uh these typ
[26:23] keep typing they could type the Book of
[26:25] Revelations in just a few minutes
[26:28] right but it covers a 2-year period so
[26:31] John's not in a dream two years no he's
[26:34] in and out he sees things he comes back
[26:37] and he sees something else he comes back
[26:38] and he sees something else like I said
[26:40] it's not saying in Revelation 6 where
[26:42] the seals are at of even mentioning
[26:46] 144,000 but then John is carried over
[26:50] and he sees Le and he picks up who that
[26:52] is that is in chapter six amen you know
[26:57] all right right see then 11 12 1 is
[27:00] dealing with that group of
[27:03] people because the bride goes up in
[27:05] Revelations 4:1 and she's not seen till
[27:08] 19:21
[27:10] amen all right see then that way those
[27:15] natural things that are taking place I
[27:16] want to cover that in a minute that's
[27:19] taking place to
[27:21] Israel I don't want it to take place to
[27:25] me you know you may holler dream about
[27:28] it to me well we just don't like your
[27:30] carnal way of applying things well you
[27:33] know I've explained it over and over for
[27:35] 40 years you know almost amen the seals
[27:38] are to Israel Amen in the literal extent
[27:43] right right but we get the Revelation on
[27:46] all of that's right amen we see where
[27:48] the man of sin starts at right amen and
[27:52] comes down Through the Ages but you
[27:55] better not be over there when the man of
[27:56] sin sits in the temple of God showing
[27:57] himself to be as God because you're in a
[27:59] tribulation period you done miss the
[28:01] Rapture amen right see that's seal
[28:04] number
[28:06] one certainly don't want to be around
[28:08] when seal number six takes place in the
[28:09] tribulation amen that's
[28:12] right and we certainly know we don't fit
[28:14] in the one where where the fifth seal
[28:17] Jew you know right so then maybe we want
[28:20] to get down and just consider the
[28:22] thought instead of I just don't think
[28:25] that's right I got my own idea
[28:28] well good for
[28:30] you come and tell me what it
[28:34] is I'm open come and tell me what your
[28:37] idea
[28:38] is sure but now we're going to get into
[28:40] something just a minute that I dealt on
[28:43] beat on hollered on screamed on for 30
[28:45] something
[28:47] years and that'll be our
[28:53] thought the Bible is
[28:56] written
[28:58] to
[28:58] were and your prophet's message is
[29:01] perfectly identical with the Bible and
[29:03] the way the Bible is written amen yes
[29:05] sir the Bible is written where it's got
[29:07] a compound meaning amen that's right
[29:11] yes now we read the scriptures and I
[29:13] know we all do okay we say and I'm
[29:17] listen forgive me now what you say I
[29:20] read the Robbie said it the other day so
[29:22] I think on him okay he's on the front
[29:25] row up here yeah he said he said I read
[29:27] something and he said I get something
[29:29] and he said I read something I get some
[29:30] more and I read something and get some
[29:31] more that's good because that's what it
[29:33] does it unfolds right but if we read
[29:36] something and then we get something
[29:38] different
[29:40] right now different like opposition
[29:43] right not different of who it's dealing
[29:45] with or times or whatever but dealing
[29:48] like opposition in other words you see
[29:50] the white horse rider over here is a
[29:53] Holy Ghost and you see him over here is
[29:54] Antichrist no that's not right no right
[29:58] that can't fit you can't have one God
[30:00] here and three Gods here but we're all
[30:01] saying the same thing no
[30:06] no is that enough nose right no it don't
[30:10] work but see it can be of a compound
[30:13] meaning now
[30:15] not one meaning being off hot dog the
[30:20] other meaning of black dog right you you
[30:24] you're done separated yourself right one
[30:27] can't say Jesus Christ is the same
[30:29] yesterday today and forever and the
[30:30] other one say well in a way he
[30:33] was no now amen my brother stood right
[30:37] here one time talking about he said I I
[30:40] can see that myself is that white horse
[30:45] rider then he went through the seals and
[30:47] everybody oh great that's wonderful I I
[30:51] know I'm mean Old Goat but I got up
[30:54] behind him and was asked the question I
[30:56] got up and I said
[30:58] if the brother seen himself as the white
[30:59] horse rider he didn't say the horse he
[31:02] said the rider I said that's a Theon
[31:05] which is unable
[31:06] unconverted right Beast right you don't
[31:10] take an unconverted beast and convert it
[31:14] you that's what we was we lost but we
[31:16] wern't Beast we were just human beings
[31:19] they was lost amen see people don't like
[31:23] me because I'm that way but come on put
[31:24] it in the word that's right am
[31:28] I fought all these years and I thought
[31:29] about it the other day old shamard you
[31:31] know he didn't like it but he grabbed up
[31:33] a ox go one day and he went to work yep
[31:36] right and I thought well maybe it's
[31:39] about time for sham
[31:40] guard to start saying put up or shut
[31:44] up right get in or get out that's right
[31:49] because it's time we do amen amen well
[31:52] you're right in the middle I agree with
[31:53] you and I'm working on me you say no
[31:56] he's working on me well
[32:00] you better do some work
[32:02] yourself you know you don't just run
[32:04] well he'll take me out when he wants to
[32:07] uhuh no you better get it right all
[32:08] right but compound meaning Now does not
[32:11] mean two different meanings in the basis
[32:15] of one meaning this is wrong and you
[32:18] know this is wrong over here you'll see
[32:20] that it means it can apply here and it
[32:23] can apply here right right all right
[32:27] right brother R said even
[32:29] people MH right you know here and here
[32:35] right all right and we'll see that it
[32:38] will deal with is like I'm trying to
[32:41] bring about the opening of the seal you
[32:43] said well you preach this to us years
[32:44] and years I know it but maybe somebody
[32:46] out there needs it so you go to sleep
[32:48] and we'll take care it's on the
[32:50] internet you ought not be that
[32:55] nasty no order be harder that's right
[32:59] now order to walk down and say yeah with
[33:02] a pencil and say wake up yeah you
[33:06] know you remember they used to do that
[33:08] in the old days you know they had a had
[33:10] a big old stick and theyd walk along
[33:11] with a stick for men went to sleep they
[33:13] poked them if the women went to sleep
[33:15] they had a feather on the end you know
[33:17] they tickled them it's really nice to
[33:19] the women you know yeah they
[33:22] tickle okay get off get the meaning but
[33:27] listen Church see that's the way I
[33:30] understand the Bible right that's it see
[33:33] then I can take what brother Brandon
[33:34] will say about the the seals or
[33:40] anything and and and I can look at it
[33:44] and I can agree with him when he says
[33:45] this is to the
[33:46] bride y right and then he comes over
[33:49] here say but this is to Israel y that's
[33:53] right that's right if you'll notice this
[33:56] will be a key when when we get in a
[33:57] minute cuz he uses the word a lot of
[33:59] times he'll use for Israel he'll use the
[34:02] word literal that's
[34:04] right notice in you're listening he'll
[34:07] be using say
[34:09] literal and then he'll say
[34:14] spiritual now you can take those two and
[34:18] they'll make a beautiful
[34:19] picture if you line it up correctly if
[34:22] it don't you got a literal and a
[34:24] spiritual and you're saying well brother
[34:27] Dale's wrong cuz this means
[34:29] this if we get time to get to it brother
[34:32] Brown says the remnant of the woman's
[34:34] seed
[34:37] right is who
[34:44] yep is it Revelation 13 12 we just
[34:48] read he says it's the foolish virgin
[34:51] that's
[34:52] right no no no no no I got to quot let
[34:55] me finish it before you do
[34:57] and he says it's the
[35:00] 144,000
[35:02] right and you know he's perfectly right
[35:07] sure and exactly with the scriptures
[35:11] mhm the foolish
[35:14] virgins and the
[35:18] 144,000 listen have the testimony of
[35:22] Jesus Christ sure sure they foolish vir
[35:25] no they don't yes they do yes they do
[35:28] absolutely
[35:31] amen and you see then that way there is
[35:34] a compound
[35:37] meaning y not different
[35:43] meanings but using it one time to apply
[35:46] to this and another time apply to
[35:48] this and you can see it open so I want
[35:51] to give the the the quotes on this I
[35:53] know I say that a lot but go ahead
[35:55] brother with number one one let's get in
[35:58] it but remember now we're not just
[35:59] talking about Revelations 12 or 11 or
[36:03] 10 if you'll look at this this way
[36:05] you'll see the seals open that the
[36:08] literal seals and the things that are
[36:09] happening are to Israel that's
[36:12] right but they've got to have a
[36:14] beginning back there to where he would
[36:16] even say it like this he said them seals
[36:18] that seventh
[36:20] seal using both of them he said started
[36:23] in
[36:24] Genesis y
[36:27] and worked its way
[36:29] down but see then we're standing here
[36:31] today people say the seven seal ain't
[36:33] broke yet this
[36:38] way but see that's the way people
[36:41] are we try to make our own Thoughts with
[36:44] our own revelation we think and don't
[36:48] think
[36:50] Church come on you can take my word or
[36:52] you can do what you want to with it
[36:54] don't think that you can't have wrong
[36:57] Doctrine and set down and scriptures
[37:00] will flow together that will look
[37:02] correct don't you ever think that
[37:04] because you got a problem one of these
[37:06] days cuz you're going to say the Lord
[37:08] led me to read
[37:12] that I always say something led me
[37:16] because I figure a lot of times old
[37:17] Devils led
[37:21] me don't you think Satan can't put
[37:23] scriptures together no now I got a quote
[37:26] he can't put the word
[37:29] together that's exactly right but Satan
[37:33] can bring scriptures and make them look
[37:35] so
[37:37] beautiful right you think the
[37:39] trinitarian people don't say that the
[37:40] Holy Spirit tells them there's a trinity
[37:43] Y and they read the Bible y that's right
[37:47] the same scriptures you read to see one
[37:50] God they read the Bible and says it says
[37:54] three y now so wrong some words that's
[37:58] not compound meaning now if you think
[38:00] that's what I'm talking about let's
[38:01] erase that that's not compound meaning
[38:04] you see a trinity and other one see a
[38:06] Oneness or something that's not compound
[38:09] compound is going to be something
[38:11] related together
[38:16] right those seals open to the Bri to
[38:19] Israel but we are the bride right they
[38:22] open through the prophet's message and
[38:25] we by that get to ability to change
[38:27] these bodies will be changed amen and go
[38:31] into Rapture amen from the same thing
[38:35] that will put them in the tribulation
[38:37] and God standing there through two
[38:39] prophets preaching to them in the
[38:41] tribulation to L say where did you get
[38:43] the nail prints in your hand there's you
[38:48] compound one showing us the other one
[38:50] showing them if you'll study the Bible
[38:53] that way or anything you'll see it a
[38:54] whole lot better all right so let's see
[38:57] what brother R had to say about it this
[39:00] part of compound meaning and then we're
[39:02] going to get on down into the other
[39:04] about time all right for the mesy palor
[39:06] locus caterpillar can Locus canor
[39:10] caterpillar 53 612 and that's how the
[39:13] Spirit come upon this prophet and he he
[39:15] foresaw things he saw the condition of
[39:17] the
[39:18] Jews and he saw the condition of the
[39:21] church in this day right compound right
[39:25] now watch now this prophecy of course
[39:27] like all other
[39:29] prophecy has a compound
[39:32] meaning a prophecy sometimes has a
[39:35] natural
[39:36] meaning then it has a spiritual meaning
[39:40] now he didn't say different meaning
[39:42] right
[39:44] okay now of course the natural meaning
[39:47] of that even Dr Scofield's notes he said
[39:50] I'm not a scoffield ID you pronounce but
[39:53] however in his footnotes there he gives
[39:55] and he's referring to this part of the
[39:57] scripture the one he's dealing with that
[39:59] it meant when the syrians come over and
[40:01] invaded he's he's covering another
[40:03] scripture not in the Book of Revelation
[40:05] covering that part but it's also had a
[40:07] meaning of the last
[40:10] days so the scripture he's talking about
[40:13] that means the syrians come down and
[40:16] invade as a meaning that comes over here
[40:19] right okay so then your Bibles in the
[40:22] last days the condition of the church
[40:24] spiritually in the last days amen so a
[40:27] compound
[40:28] meaning has a natural meaning then it
[40:31] has a spiritual
[40:34] meaning go ahead to the next
[40:38] one message Dr
[40:40] Moses 55
[40:44] 1114
[40:46] e16 all scripture has a compound meaning
[40:49] are it runs in
[40:52] cycles for
[40:55] instant
[40:57] there where it said in St Matthew I
[40:58] believe it was out of Egypt I have
[41:00] called my son now that scripture that
[41:03] Matthew was referring to was really
[41:05] pertaining to
[41:07] Israel okay and God said out of Egypt
[41:11] I'll call my son Israel yep he called
[41:15] his Israel son out but it also meant
[41:19] Jesus out of Egypt yep I've called my
[41:22] son and how it routines back the cycle
[41:26] of time swinging back ever so often
[41:29] history repeats itself the scripture
[41:31] repeats itself down through the age any
[41:35] scholar knows that that ever studied it
[41:37] from a spiritual standpoint to watch how
[41:39] scripture will repeat itself run in
[41:42] cycle like that it certainly does all
[41:45] right one says call a son out of Egypt
[41:49] you remember the story Pharaoh all the
[41:52] kids we'll get back to it in a minute or
[41:54] what you call him Herod Herod was the
[41:56] one that was doing that Caesar if you
[41:58] want to put his name there trying to
[42:00] kill all the babies Joseph and Mary took
[42:03] Jesus to Egypt Y and he came out of
[42:08] Egypt all right but a compound meaning
[42:11] man what I'm talking about the children
[42:12] of Israel coming up out of Egypt the
[42:15] other one is the compound meaning Jesus
[42:18] who come up out of Egypt that doesn't
[42:20] say Jesus come out out of um some place
[42:24] way over the ocean
[42:27] you see the point is there and it's not
[42:30] well that's just the way you see it but
[42:32] I see it like
[42:35] this okay if it's not
[42:39] contrary but if you see a white dog and
[42:41] I see a black one somebody's goofed up
[42:43] somewhere so it's not in that form see
[42:47] it's it's compounding it look at the
[42:49] next one this is life preaching
[42:53] 1957
[42:55] 602
[42:58] he's illustrating it now like a compound
[43:00] so watching no wonder then the word life
[43:03] must have a a a compound meaning to it
[43:08] must mean more than than one
[43:12] thing life itself means in
[43:17] existence so then if thy loving kindness
[43:20] is better than
[43:22] life then what could be any better
[43:26] see two different meanings right right
[43:30] life just means an existence but if his
[43:33] loving kindness is better than life it's
[43:36] got to be greater right because God
[43:38] alone has eternal life God alone has
[43:40] eternal life if we can't if if we can
[43:42] get that straight now it will be easy
[43:45] for us to see the great picture God sets
[43:48] before us how that some day that
[43:50] everything that isn't of God will vanish
[43:53] and perish and go away but life will be
[43:55] brought into the be right yes come me go
[43:58] ahead to number
[44:01] four here you himym
[44:03] 1957 7:25 and here your himym is Matthew
[44:06] 17 right on the mountain Etc right okay
[44:10] getting that so you'll understand what
[44:11] he saying this is rather an unusual
[44:14] scripture and I wish to not of course we
[44:17] know that the real meaning for most of
[44:19] you ministers refer to this
[44:21] scripture and watch to is to the second
[44:25] coming the order of the com second
[44:27] coming of Christ which is right it's
[44:29] most certainly right okay now that's the
[44:32] scripture y but every scripture has a
[44:35] compound meaning many times a prophecy
[44:38] will mean a certain thing to happen here
[44:41] and repeat it over here
[44:44] again like in St Matthew the third
[44:47] chapter when he said out of Egypt I've
[44:49] called my son now that refers back to
[44:51] the calling out calling out Jacob was
[44:55] his son also so and it meant calling out
[44:57] of his son Jesus so it had a compound
[45:01] meaning compound two times that it was
[45:05] meant to be
[45:07] fulfilled so now I hope you're getting
[45:09] what my point right
[45:11] man see then the seals is
[45:15] to
[45:19] Israel Revelations 7 8 9 10 you say 10
[45:26] in that's us this message is going to
[45:31] Israel 11 12 13 14 15 I'm going to keep
[45:36] repeating this for
[45:39] 15 times to make sure you get it see
[45:43] that way you can look at the scriptures
[45:45] and you can say wait a
[45:46] minute now that was there but is it here
[45:50] mhm cuz see I can take if you want to be
[45:53] smart eally I can say no man can call
[45:55] Jesus the Christ that was back there I
[45:59] don't have nothing to do with
[46:01] us like a big man in this message said
[46:03] years ago and I heard him he said when
[46:06] you say the third pull is to the bride
[46:09] he said it was only for Jesus and
[46:10] brother
[46:13] Brown I said well I just can't read that
[46:16] away that ain't what he said that's
[46:18] right amen same man said I don't believe
[46:21] and I heard him said I don't believe in
[46:24] dispensations and the Bible said the
[46:27] dispensations and brother R said you
[46:28] people that don't believe in
[46:30] dispensation what about this but you see
[46:33] I going to change
[46:35] nobody the prophet tell you something
[46:37] they going to change you until you
[46:38] believe it right all right but see look
[46:42] what it's at look at the next one number
[46:46] five this day this scripture fulfilled
[46:49] 65 219 paragraph
[46:53] 5758 and history always repeats it
[46:56] itself and scripture has a compound
[46:59] meaning to
[47:00] it and a compound Revelation
[47:06] right
[47:08] okay not just a meaning that has a
[47:10] compound Revelation I called my son out
[47:12] of
[47:14] Egypt that revealing Egypt coming out
[47:17] Israel coming out of
[47:19] Egypt Revelation to what Jesus coming
[47:22] out so that's what he's referring to for
[47:24] instance it says in the Bible that out
[47:26] of Egypt I called my son referring to
[47:28] Jesus run the margin on that and you'll
[47:30] find you find out also refer to Jacob
[47:33] same scripture Jesus was his greater son
[47:36] Jacob was his son that he called out of
[47:38] Egypt which the Scofield references and
[47:41] all the other references give to it
[47:43] because that's the Scripture it was
[47:45] referring to to it had a double answer
[47:49] it had an answer to Jacob called out and
[47:52] to Jesus called out right all right
[47:57] now so it's got a double meaning not a
[48:00] double meaning as different I keep
[48:03] repeating
[48:04] that see I I preach something and people
[48:07] they they run across and they just hear
[48:09] what they want to hear and then they
[48:10] come along and say well brother de said
[48:13] so and
[48:14] so I can say I didn't say that I heard
[48:18] you see your mind and west running
[48:20] that's what you heard but you heard what
[48:22] you wanted to
[48:23] hear you don't ever run it back
[48:29] what do you mean I listen that why I
[48:31] need to run back let's do it
[48:34] again I heard brother say
[48:39] so
[48:41] yeah you're the one responsible for
[48:43] saying I said something when I didn't
[48:45] say it I'm responsible for saying
[48:49] something that's right okay now but
[48:52] think about
[48:53] it see come compound
[48:57] now two even meanings compound as even
[49:02] to a revelation of calling out of
[49:06] Egypt of Jacob a revelation of calling
[49:09] Jesus out of
[49:11] Egypt so now you don't have no problem
[49:13] with the scripture do you you don't have
[49:16] to go
[49:17] along that means
[49:22] that well see now you've narrowed
[49:24] yourself down you have no hope
[49:26] right you can't study the Bible like
[49:28] that you can't study this message out
[49:31] way well brother Rand I illustrate all
[49:33] time and say I can prove that you're
[49:35] born again and baptized into the
[49:38] body and then you'll turn around a
[49:39] little bit and say maybe in the same
[49:41] message might say it that the baptism
[49:44] into the body is the birth of Jesus the
[49:46] new birth of you know Jesus Christ and
[49:48] your soul
[49:50] right now you've made him say things he
[49:53] didn't
[49:54] say I give you word for word right all
[50:02] right but you see that's where our minds
[50:07] twist you brother you're trying to do
[50:10] away with my ability to
[50:14] think let me be honest I wish I
[50:17] could is that any
[50:21] problem you know 40 years I've been
[50:23] trying to do that so might as well tell
[50:26] you I've been trying to convert your
[50:28] mind I don't have anything to do with
[50:31] converting your
[50:32] soul right God has to do
[50:37] that but your pastor has to get on there
[50:39] and deal with these things and what have
[50:42] I always dealt with the things that look
[50:44] like Daniel 7 weeks
[50:47] right that look like said this and look
[50:51] like he said
[50:53] this and I would spend months showing
[50:55] that that's not what he's
[51:00] saying doctrines and
[51:04] ideas people have
[51:07] had and then have to spend months trying
[51:09] to erase
[51:10] that
[51:13] yep just like it was when the two Soul
[51:16] came out this man said one day he said
[51:17] I've been looking for that all my
[51:21] life well why didn't he preach it yeah
[51:27] but see he so thought it was
[51:31] true
[51:35] right you go tell a trinitarian there's
[51:37] no such thing as a trinity in the Bible
[51:39] yeah he'll give you a lot of scriptures
[51:42] and a lot of understanding and you know
[51:45] what he can pull up this message and
[51:46] give you a lot of quotes well brother
[51:49] Ram said let's stand and address the
[51:51] third person of the
[51:54] Trinity right that's right
[51:58] y now do you ever teach a
[52:01] trinity not even before before the
[52:04] opening of the word in 63 he didn't do
[52:06] nothing like that you understand what
[52:08] I'm getting
[52:10] at see we make him say what we want him
[52:14] to say that's right amen that's
[52:17] it I sat down before I preach anything I
[52:20] try to find the pros and the cons the
[52:22] things that seem different and don't
[52:25] mind giving them to
[52:27] you because somewhere they'll come
[52:29] together amen that's right now we
[52:32] believe in slips of the tongues we
[52:33] believe in all kind of things right
[52:35] around said 700
[52:36] 7,000 that's a human
[52:40] being well he was a prophet I believe
[52:42] everything well your mind slips a whole
[52:45] lot I get tickled at somewh around here
[52:47] that get up and say brother Dale most
[52:49] quotes in scriptures and then when
[52:50] they're up here quoting saying I just
[52:52] sat there Li boy he missed that
[52:56] he quoted that wrong I try to be
[52:59] nice I know I'm
[53:02] not but that's all
[53:05] right it's just it's not being silly
[53:08] either but now
[53:11] listen we got into this why I started
[53:14] off with
[53:16] Revelations 11 or 12 excuse me what at
[53:20] 127 cuz we got kind of down to that of
[53:22] Michael being cast out of heaven
[53:26] so he was cast out of Heaven before the
[53:27] foundation of the
[53:30] world you know Satan was Lucifer Michael
[53:33] and Lucifer F Lucifer was cast out not
[53:38] Micha but then need to be cast out in
[53:41] the last day amen that's
[53:44] right the Same Old
[53:47] Devil with a different group of people
[53:50] right you know or whatever talks
[53:52] whatever you
[53:53] want see and that's
[53:56] compound see that shows you the meaning
[54:00] that you can read the book of
[54:01] Revelations and you can see well this is
[54:04] not so confusing
[54:06] anymore haven't you read that haven't
[54:09] you read there where Michael and War in
[54:10] heaven you wonder where that happen
[54:13] yeah
[54:15] right and then you pick up the message
[54:17] and say boy the message is going to
[54:19] clear this up real good Prophet is going
[54:21] to tell us that was back there for the
[54:23] foundation world and then one day you're
[54:26] reading along
[54:28] and around
[54:30] says when we go up Satan's cast
[54:34] out cuz he's up in heaven now accusing
[54:36] the
[54:39] brother
[54:41] uh you think it don't get
[54:44] confusing you can make brother brandom
[54:46] say anything you want him to say that's
[54:49] right that's
[54:50] right
[54:52] right and we done that when we was the
[54:55] bad news I told you we preached one week
[54:57] there was none good no not one we sent
[54:58] everybody to Hell the next week we
[55:01] preached be therefore perfect even as
[55:02] your father in Heaven at perect send
[55:04] every Baptist to Heaven I said Baptist
[55:07] to heaven we didn't want all the rest of
[55:08] to
[55:10] go you say that's silly no that's the
[55:14] truth if they didn't come our way they
[55:16] didn't
[55:18] go come
[55:20] on but listen
[55:22] church so let's read it reread that
[55:24] quote again let see
[55:27] compound go ahead with number six
[55:30] compound meaning compound Revelation
[55:33] even
[55:34] mhm brother says in the 361 of the first
[55:38] seal 63 318 then in Revelations 12:7
[55:42] when Satan is cast out the accuser you
[55:45] want to put that down because I want to
[55:46] read it we haven't got time to now it's
[55:48] 28 going but in Revelations 12: 7-9
[55:52] Satan the spirit the devil which is up
[55:54] there now now accuser of our Brethren
[55:57] all right the church is taken up and
[56:00] Satan is cast
[56:03] out when the church goes up Satan comes
[56:06] down then Satan incarnates himself in
[56:09] the
[56:11] Antichrist and it's called the beast
[56:14] that's after we get out of here why cuz
[56:16] we go up he comes out right he can't
[56:20] stay up there where we're at what about
[56:22] God as I tried to get across the other
[56:24] day God thinking so much of you amen did
[56:27] he let the devil sit there and talk
[56:29] about
[56:30] you and condemn you and tell all of your
[56:34] wrongs your faults your failures and
[56:35] what you're doing and he sat there and
[56:37] said see thank you amen but you let her
[56:43] go
[56:44] up he won't even leave him die
[56:49] right you think that don't joy to my
[56:53] heart somebody's going to be this bride
[56:56] that goes up when it the devil's coming
[56:58] out amen that's all right so there's a
[57:00] compound meaning
[57:03] right and do you know like I was trying
[57:05] to cover the other day when God turns to
[57:08] those
[57:12] 144,000 Satan is cast out and is's up
[57:14] earth right but you know that 144,000
[57:18] under their two
[57:19] witnesses is so
[57:22] strong and so great a group of people
[57:25] until Satan is cast out of them the
[57:29] ability to deal with
[57:33] them and do you realize the bride
[57:36] compound
[57:38] meaning the bride right now Satan is
[57:41] being cast out of your mind by the
[57:43] revealed word but not by thoughts and
[57:46] ideas or opinions but only by the
[57:49] revealed word
[57:51] amen amen come on you're old enough if
[57:54] is sensible enough to be
[57:56] plain we are not quote from the prophet
[58:00] a match for the
[58:02] devil right right you think you get him
[58:07] conquered well I conquered him I quit
[58:09] smoking but I got to go get me a
[58:11] different
[58:15] up or I quit
[58:17] drinking
[58:19] yep you know what I'm saying that's
[58:22] right don't ever think you can control
[58:24] your
[58:26] mind and the Bible says your tongue is
[58:29] the biggest problem
[58:31] too right and sister McGarity used to
[58:35] say that little wet red thing or what it
[58:37] was flapping backwards and forth between
[58:38] them old wet walls yeah cuz your Bible
[58:42] says the tongue can't be controlled
[58:44] right
[58:45] now but it wasn't talking about
[58:53] Christians now who's the Bible written
[58:55] to that's
[58:58] right amen if you're going to go that
[59:00] way we don't need a statue of perfect
[59:02] man that's right we just say we already
[59:04] got it it don't matter how we live we
[59:06] we're good Badness we're going to Heaven
[59:09] Come On Church time to get off of it
[59:11] quit playing games with ourselves that's
[59:13] right and get on with God Amen right and
[59:16] realize
[59:19] realization so when we go up Satan come
[59:22] down yep that's right amen now who do
[59:25] you think is fighting the
[59:30] battle I thought Michel was
[59:34] Christ I thought the Book of Daniel that
[59:38] have encourage you to read the compare
[59:39] to the Book of Revelation I thought the
[59:41] Book of Daniel said Michael had to come
[59:44] to the aid of
[59:48] Gabriel and take over fighting
[59:52] Satan Gabriel could to come to Daniel
[59:56] that's
[59:57] right and the Bible says D Michael
[1:00:00] you're what Prince amen and what is a
[1:00:05] prince a son waiting for papa to
[1:00:10] die to where he can become
[1:00:13] king and you know really he don't have
[1:00:16] to
[1:00:17] wait
[1:00:19] right you said get in the bot okay glad
[1:00:22] you thought of that
[1:00:26] David put Solomon in his king that's
[1:00:30] right before he died right y so don't
[1:00:34] run off with it read your
[1:00:37] Bible he put him in as king crowned him
[1:00:41] and
[1:00:43] everything see my daddy don't have to
[1:00:45] die right amen cuz my daddy can't die
[1:00:50] amen were you following
[1:00:53] me see using compound meaning compound
[1:00:57] thoughts to try to get it to where we
[1:00:59] can see this and this and how it comes
[1:01:03] together but around him in Daniel 70
[1:01:05] weeks what did he say he says seven I
[1:01:08] think seven times he says it's one week
[1:01:10] left Y and he said this is what the Holy
[1:01:13] Spirit put on my PIN to right
[1:01:16] y That's Right years later they ask him
[1:01:19] said you said he said you didn't
[1:01:21] understand
[1:01:22] me that's right right see everybody said
[1:01:25] he was wrong back here and right over
[1:01:31] here when it's compound right am amen
[1:01:35] that's right one week left to Israel but
[1:01:37] there only 3 and A2 years of Jesus's
[1:01:40] Ministry left Israel right in both
[1:01:42] places amen that's right yes sir
[1:01:45] compound
[1:01:46] meaning compound thought let's get into
[1:01:49] Revelations 12 let see how quick we can
[1:01:52] run down to here so go ahead we'll pick
[1:01:54] up back nth
[1:01:55] verse and we'll just read and make not
[1:01:58] too many
[1:01:59] comments and the Great Dragon who's the
[1:02:03] dragon did we cover it in the message
[1:02:05] before that dragon is wrong right right
[1:02:09] okay now was cast out that old serpent
[1:02:13] called the devil and Satan which
[1:02:15] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[1:02:17] out into the Earth and his Angel were
[1:02:19] cast out with it all right now and I
[1:02:22] heard a loud voice saying in heaven
[1:02:25] now has come salvation and strength and
[1:02:27] Kingdom of our God and the power of His
[1:02:30] Christ for the accuser of our Brethren
[1:02:31] is cast down which accuses them before
[1:02:33] our God day and night do you
[1:02:37] realize I heard a great voice in heaven
[1:02:40] saying salvation and strength and the
[1:02:43] kingdom of
[1:02:45] God when Satan is cast
[1:02:48] out what a glorious shouting but do you
[1:02:52] realize that is in the tribulation
[1:02:56] period go say it was cast out after we
[1:02:59] go up come
[1:03:01] on all right and they're being
[1:03:07] killed the 144,000 that killed the two
[1:03:09] witnesses are killed
[1:03:12] right but yet the Bible writes it as
[1:03:15] salvation is come strength is coming the
[1:03:17] kingdom of God has
[1:03:21] come and like I said we look at it as
[1:03:24] trying to figure out this at the
[1:03:26] other and God's tender hand of
[1:03:31] Mercy allowed over 6 million Jews to be
[1:03:35] killed to drive them to the
[1:03:42] Homeland right then thought so much of
[1:03:45] them till he pulled out a predestinated
[1:03:47] group of fi seals you and gives them
[1:03:50] eternal life amen thank you thank you
[1:03:55] that's
[1:03:56] right oh but if God was with us we
[1:03:59] wouldn't be
[1:04:00] sick you want
[1:04:03] scriptures many are the Affliction of
[1:04:06] the righteous but the Lord leadth out of
[1:04:08] them
[1:04:10] all well I'm just having so many problem
[1:04:13] what do you
[1:04:15] expect amen thank you Lord your Prophet
[1:04:20] said we're not going out of here with a
[1:04:21] flly bed of East and we're not going
[1:04:23] through the tribulation get it that's
[1:04:25] what a lot of people thinks they put
[1:04:26] them
[1:04:28] together but like I said the other day
[1:04:31] you sure W to talk about the third pull
[1:04:34] but brother R said when that squeeze
[1:04:36] comes down watch that third pull
[1:04:41] then right so it must be going to get
[1:04:43] squeezed out somewhere but you know it's
[1:04:45] not going to squeeze us out and put us
[1:04:46] down it's going to squeeze us up amen
[1:04:49] you realize the devil is the best thing
[1:04:50] you got except
[1:04:52] salvation right right that's right amen
[1:04:55] that's right because he'll beat you in
[1:04:57] the line yes and God stands back and
[1:05:01] says let him have it let him a couple
[1:05:04] extra time he needs it you say oh God's
[1:05:08] the saddest then no no he knows what we
[1:05:11] need yes he does thank God for troubles
[1:05:15] and persecutions and
[1:05:16] trials around said they are part of the
[1:05:19] Christian Life yes right
[1:05:22] that's all right y
[1:05:24] so what is he
[1:05:28] saying and they overcame him by the
[1:05:31] blood of the lamb and the word of their
[1:05:34] testimony and love not their lives unto
[1:05:37] the death that
[1:05:40] 144,000 overcome by the blood of Jesus
[1:05:42] Christ L that 144 and the two witness I
[1:05:46] mean the other two WT 14 and the foolish
[1:05:49] virgins will put them right in there in
[1:05:51] a minute with a prophet all right and
[1:05:54] look but it's by the word of their
[1:05:57] testimony see when I said that while ago
[1:05:59] I notic some of you kind of look back
[1:06:01] wondering what when I said the foolish
[1:06:03] virgin has a testimony of Jesus
[1:06:06] Christ you better think who you think
[1:06:08] they've got they talk about Jesus Christ
[1:06:11] more than we do oh Lord
[1:06:15] oh they have the testimony they don't
[1:06:17] have the possession oh my
[1:06:21] right come on now watch it all tie
[1:06:24] together we get to it in a minute but
[1:06:26] they overcome him by the blood of the
[1:06:27] lamb and by the word of the testimony
[1:06:29] they L their lives unto the death
[1:06:31] therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that
[1:06:33] dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of
[1:06:37] the earth and of the sea for the devil
[1:06:39] has come down unto you having great
[1:06:42] wrath because he knoweth that he hath
[1:06:44] but a short
[1:06:45] time and when the dragon saw that he was
[1:06:48] cast into unto the Earth he persecuted
[1:06:52] the woman y right
[1:06:54] y now that's not the bride because
[1:06:56] that's tribulation period so he's
[1:06:57] persecuting Israel right the
[1:07:00] 144,000 because like I said the other
[1:07:03] day he's not persecuting natural
[1:07:06] Israel natural Israel is after we leave
[1:07:09] out of here in a Rapture natural Israel
[1:07:12] is in a covenant the nation of Israel is
[1:07:14] in a covenant with the Antichrist
[1:07:16] they're on his side who do you than's
[1:07:18] going to kill the 144,000 and the two
[1:07:20] witnesses they don't need no Romans no
[1:07:23] more to okay it
[1:07:25] right that's right and you can call the
[1:07:28] UN all you want to it ain't going to
[1:07:29] help you no cuz they're going to be the
[1:07:32] ones that's going to be pushing it but
[1:07:34] it's natural Israel as a nation is going
[1:07:37] to kill those people right come on you
[1:07:40] said you don't have no quote for show me
[1:07:41] a quote you got some other
[1:07:43] way I just think
[1:07:45] sensibly if it can't be a and b can't be
[1:07:49] two different things cuz they're two
[1:07:50] different looking
[1:07:51] numbers but if a is a
[1:07:54] then a is a so I this the way I deal
[1:07:57] with all right and watch and the woman
[1:08:00] was given and who's the woman
[1:08:03] Israel the 144,000 in
[1:08:07] Tribulation that clock is stopped what
[1:08:09] time is
[1:08:12] 11:30 I figure I look at this clock cuz
[1:08:15] I feel like it's about 15
[1:08:21] after2 and when the dragon saw he was
[1:08:23] cting the Earth he persecuted the woman
[1:08:25] which brought forth The Man Child who
[1:08:27] brought forth The Man Child that's right
[1:08:29] we was in 11 coming forth right who
[1:08:31] brought forth the
[1:08:32] Manchild Israel gave birth now not all
[1:08:40] Israelites we're going to get to it in a
[1:08:42] minute a
[1:08:43] Remnant we can spend a week on Remnant y
[1:08:46] you know brother ROM
[1:08:48] calls um Mary um John Etc this just a
[1:08:53] few he calls them the
[1:08:57] remnant we spent a lot of time on the
[1:09:01] remnant but I'm just trying to get a
[1:09:03] point to
[1:09:05] you the woman which brought forth The
[1:09:08] Man
[1:09:09] Child Israel the elected predestinated
[1:09:14] Israel the chosen of Israel gave birth
[1:09:17] to Jesus Christ the nation of nation of
[1:09:20] Israel never gave birth to Jesus Christ
[1:09:23] that's right it was only just a
[1:09:26] handful of predestinated that brought
[1:09:30] Christ only 144,000 is going to bring
[1:09:32] Christ in the end time right right
[1:09:36] already 3 million or so Jews over there
[1:09:38] right I think that's the last I heard it
[1:09:42] what and the woman was given two wings
[1:09:45] of a great eal now you remember the
[1:09:47] story brother around and said those
[1:09:48] people didn't want to come home and said
[1:09:50] those prophets walked out there and told
[1:09:52] them and said you're going to home on
[1:09:53] the wings of an eagle they got on the
[1:09:56] Plains and
[1:09:58] flew all right they're going back to the
[1:10:00] Homeland why to see the Messiah yes and
[1:10:04] the woman was given two wings of a great
[1:10:05] Eagle that she might fly into the
[1:10:07] Wilderness into her place where she has
[1:10:09] nourished for a time and times and a
[1:10:11] half time from the face of the serpent
[1:10:14] three and one half years time times
[1:10:17] times is two time times the two makes
[1:10:19] three and a half yep right yep only

[1:14:09] until the end of the ministry of the two
[1:14:13] witnesses
[1:14:14] right right amen so don't matter what
[1:14:18] floods you run after them what group of
[1:14:21] people you try to get them killed by
[1:14:25] what about Moses you come on I wish I
[1:14:28] had for hour what about Moses you never
[1:14:31] thought about
[1:14:33] Moses come on I'll tried to explain that
[1:14:35] to you
[1:14:36] before but now here sits
[1:14:40] phoh and Moses goes up and he said let
[1:14:43] my people
[1:14:45] go he says go cut his
[1:14:50] throat how come he didn't
[1:14:54] why didn't he do that he's
[1:14:58] scared cuz remember the guy that's
[1:15:00] sitting on the throne when Moses came
[1:15:03] back was not Daddy Pharaoh that was
[1:15:06] there that believed Moses was his Grand
[1:15:09] son you know all right and made him his
[1:15:13] own son you know and would made him
[1:15:16] leader over Israel Y and that old guy
[1:15:19] got mad that when he left and he takes
[1:15:21] over but he still
[1:15:24] scar because Moses just walks up in his
[1:15:26] face let my people go right he said
[1:15:29] Moses I got enough sense you got enough
[1:15:31] sense no I can cut your throat he says
[1:15:33] go ahead and
[1:15:36] try that's right he said CU if you do
[1:15:39] he's not wrote the Bible but he said if
[1:15:40] you do there's going to be another
[1:15:42] Insurrection because remember I was the
[1:15:45] commander of the army that's right right
[1:15:49] was
[1:15:51] he he was in commanded Army Army of
[1:15:54] Israel he said I can just take over this
[1:15:57] place if I want to but said I didn't
[1:15:58] come down here to do that I come down
[1:16:01] here to get my people that's right just
[1:16:03] let them go and everything will be all
[1:16:06] right okay he won Face I I'm let him go
[1:16:09] the devil gets on him and say don't you
[1:16:11] turn him loose that's right right y read
[1:16:13] your Bible he in many cases is ready to
[1:16:16] free
[1:16:17] Israel but the Bible says the end the
[1:16:20] devil come on
[1:16:21] him devil come
[1:16:24] you know one day he finally got so much
[1:16:25] of it he said just get out of here speci
[1:16:29] cuz you done destroyed my whole
[1:16:31] nation come on F this in
[1:16:34] here the Earth swallows up all of that
[1:16:37] garbage and won't let them kill that
[1:16:39] 144,000 and two witnesses until they're
[1:16:41] finished with their ministry right right
[1:16:43] that's right they can't touch it but
[1:16:44] when they're finished they're killed
[1:16:46] okay that's right well that don't look
[1:16:49] good why would God let him be killed cuz
[1:16:50] he wrote and said he would right
[1:16:54] cuz how else can he get them in the
[1:16:56] Millennium that's
[1:16:57] right CU 144,000 remember was in the
[1:17:00] Millennium right what your Prophet said
[1:17:03] that's right the Unix to the brother so
[1:17:06] come on now we'll get out of this okay
[1:17:07] the dragon was Ral with the woman and
[1:17:09] went to make war with the remnant of her
[1:17:12] seed which keep the Commandments of God
[1:17:15] and have the testimony of Jesus
[1:17:18] Christ what about
[1:17:22] it
[1:17:23] now
[1:17:25] watch who is this
[1:17:28] remnant of her
[1:17:32] seed I said a moment ago John
[1:17:37] and Mary and some of those that brother
[1:17:40] around n it says they're the
[1:17:42] remnant of
[1:17:45] Israel the 144,000 is a remnant of
[1:17:51] Israel okay
[1:17:54] but you know there's another part that's
[1:17:56] been fit in there that I love to be part
[1:17:58] of you know how you do you sisters
[1:18:01] you're going to make a
[1:18:03] dress and you take the P pattern and you
[1:18:05] lay it out and you cut out the the dress
[1:18:08] and you sew it up and make a beautiful
[1:18:10] dress and you have a lot of clippings or
[1:18:12] whatever you want to call it you have a
[1:18:14] lot of leftover material you know it's
[1:18:16] the same identical
[1:18:17] material
[1:18:21] right
[1:18:23] and see but it's just not chosen for
[1:18:26] that
[1:18:29] place the
[1:18:32] 144,000 is the
[1:18:35] remnant but they're not they just
[1:18:37] wouldn't chosen for to be the
[1:18:43] bride That Old Testament bride will come
[1:18:45] up one
[1:18:47] day but she will never
[1:18:49] be the Born Again Believers of the Bride
[1:18:52] of Jesus Jus Christ right she'll never
[1:18:56] be Joseph's wife right that was sitting
[1:19:00] in the
[1:19:01] temple in her father's house brother R
[1:19:04] said I was asked that question in the
[1:19:06] meeting recently where will they go
[1:19:08] brother R
[1:19:10] said we'll go over to the father's
[1:19:14] Palace you
[1:19:17] remember Joseph's wife was over in the
[1:19:20] palace right you know his brothers never
[1:19:22] did become his wife and you know if he
[1:19:25] had a bunch of sisters which probably
[1:19:28] did cuz he didn't list them you know
[1:19:30] right come on and you know that there's
[1:19:32] none of them chosen to be his
[1:19:35] wife but they were his brothers and
[1:19:39] sisters they got their place
[1:19:42] right it's all because of Calvary
[1:19:46] right right now they both they got to
[1:19:50] have these two groups we cover now is
[1:19:52] got to have the Commandments of God and
[1:19:55] have the testimony of Jesus Christ right
[1:19:58] okay so we're give them to you in order
[1:20:02] so go now Brothers if you
[1:20:05] will you going to have to jump now so go
[1:20:08] over to number 10 don't go to the next
[1:20:13] one that you're needing go to number
[1:20:15] 10 get we run it over cuz we could read
[1:20:17] the others but I'm doing this for a
[1:20:20] point all right
[1:20:23] the 10 virgins 144,000 196 12 11 in the
[1:20:27] morning paragraph 255 and that's the
[1:20:29] Seal of God we know that and remember
[1:20:32] there's only 144,000 of the Jews
[1:20:37] sealed which was the remnant of the Jews
[1:20:41] left over right and he goes into the
[1:20:43] Gentile bride so where is the seat of
[1:20:46] the woman The Remnant it's the 144,000
[1:20:49] because we're dealing with the Israel in
[1:20:51] the tribulation right go ahead to number
[1:20:56] 11 this is still in the 10 virgins
[1:20:58] paragraph 3:16 how do you understand
[1:21:00] what the remnant of the Jews is
[1:21:03] 144,000 where they're sitting waiting
[1:21:05] right at the hour can you see now that
[1:21:08] the foolish
[1:21:10] virgin that he covers with them wouldn't
[1:21:12] take the oil and will have to rise and
[1:21:15] be separated rise and see got to do that
[1:21:18] but who
[1:21:19] is the
[1:21:21] remnant The 100
[1:21:24] 44,000 is the remnant of
[1:21:28] Israel and you know that Remnant
[1:21:30] according to what we read have the
[1:21:33] testimony of Jesus
[1:21:36] Christ but remember the fifth seal Jew
[1:21:40] it says for the word of God and the
[1:21:43] testimony they
[1:21:46] held right which was not the new birth
[1:21:50] of Jesus
[1:21:51] Christ
[1:21:53] but those 144,000 will receive the
[1:21:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost if you call it
[1:21:58] the new birth I don't like the word New
[1:22:00] Birth because of the fact that the new
[1:22:03] birth to me puts you in the body of
[1:22:05] Christ right as a born again believer
[1:22:08] amen they receive eternal
[1:22:10] life right you can call it the baptism
[1:22:13] if you want to as long as you're holding
[1:22:15] it that they're not placed into the body
[1:22:17] of Christ right so they have their
[1:22:21] position they're the remnant of the
[1:22:22] woman
[1:22:25] seed all
[1:22:27] right now drop back to number
[1:22:30] eight
[1:22:33] okay and you'll see that he says it's
[1:22:35] the foolish
[1:22:38] version paragraph three I think it
[1:22:41] is the patus vision pretty good theology
[1:22:44] talking about what he
[1:22:47] writing think it too that they are the
[1:22:50] remnant the sleeping virgin is the The
[1:22:52] Remnant spoke of in
[1:22:56] Revelation now if you don't have the
[1:22:57] compound meaning where you going with
[1:22:59] it I just read to you that he says that
[1:23:02] it's 144,000 now he's saying it the
[1:23:04] foolish
[1:23:05] virgin see if you don't have the
[1:23:07] compound meaning you're lost right
[1:23:09] you're going to be arguing quotes right
[1:23:12] come on the sleeping virgin is a remnant
[1:23:14] of the remnant spoke of in Revelation of
[1:23:17] the woman see that keep the Commandments
[1:23:19] of God and have the testimony of Jesus
[1:23:21] Christ
[1:23:23] MH
[1:23:25] yep that foolish virgin will have the
[1:23:27] testimony of Jesus Christ and the word
[1:23:30] of
[1:23:31] God the testimony that they hold yep but
[1:23:35] they just don't have the new birth right
[1:23:38] the 144,000 are not in the body of
[1:23:41] Christ but they receiveing you bir the
[1:23:44] foolish virgin has to go to the white
[1:23:46] Throne to receive her new bird as you
[1:23:48] want to call it her eternal
[1:23:51] life
[1:23:53] who you see compound meaning right right
[1:23:56] compound meaning one more I think here
[1:23:59] go ahead with the next one you can read
[1:24:01] all that up down through there called
[1:24:03] Remnant and everything El leftover is
[1:24:04] called a Remnant needs to explain it
[1:24:07] okay number
[1:24:08] nine takeing sides with Jesus 62601
[1:24:11] paragraph 55 which we realize in
[1:24:14] Revelation it's just 1 2 three chapters
[1:24:16] to the church the church goes up in the
[1:24:18] fourth chapter and does not return
[1:24:19] anymore till the 19th Chapter that's
[1:24:21] after the tri ation period when God
[1:24:24] called out the Jews that's right 56 all
[1:24:28] and like Enoch he went up before one
[1:24:31] drop of rain ever hit the earth he was
[1:24:33] gone and then the tribulation sets in
[1:24:36] see Noah was in the ark before any
[1:24:38] tribulation not out of Sodom before any
[1:24:41] tribulation set in and the church will
[1:24:43] be gone before any tribulation period
[1:24:47] right now what now during the
[1:24:49] tribulation that will be the sleeping
[1:24:51] virgin will be h hunted down by the
[1:24:53] dragon and Spurs water from his mouth
[1:24:57] the
[1:24:58] people not fing water
[1:25:01] peoples to try to conquer her which
[1:25:04] means multitudes and peoples armies that
[1:25:07] will search down and take this woman
[1:25:10] remnant of her seed and will kill her
[1:25:14] and that will be in a tribulation period
[1:25:15] that's right the church will be gone
[1:25:17] home prise the Lord now if you don't
[1:25:19] believe in compound meaning look where
[1:25:21] you're at
[1:25:24] you got a prophet telling you that
[1:25:26] Revelations means 144,000 you got a
[1:25:30] prophet that says Revelation means
[1:25:32] foolish
[1:25:33] virgins but what I love about it I'll
[1:25:36] just read to you what I wrote and then
[1:25:38] come on
[1:25:40] musicians I'll just read to you what I
[1:25:43] wrote down see the remnant of the Bride
[1:25:45] is the foolish virgin M the foolish
[1:25:48] virgin is the remnant of the Bride right
[1:25:51] right she's watch left over right made
[1:25:53] of the same material but this doesn't
[1:25:55] have that chosen ability right amen but
[1:25:59] the remnant other Jews is 144,000 see
[1:26:02] because it's the same material see the
[1:26:04] foolish virgins have the teaching of
[1:26:07] Jesus Christ but not the new birth
[1:26:12] amen so they're known for their
[1:26:15] testimony of Jesus
[1:26:18] Christ whereas
[1:26:21] 144,000
[1:26:23] which is here in the tribulation we're
[1:26:24] talking about have the testimony of
[1:26:27] Jesus Christ because they receive Jesus
[1:26:30] Christ into their heart
[1:26:32] am compound meaning
[1:26:36] y see makes it clear to where we can
[1:26:39] take this and this and say compound now
[1:26:42] folks don't please I know I'm
[1:26:46] sorry but don't come up with a black dog
[1:26:48] white dog and say brother Dale said
[1:26:50] compound meaning oh I believe that
[1:26:53] compound meaning Brother D I got it now
[1:26:56] that was a black dog that was a white
[1:26:57] dog now that's no such thing of what I
[1:27:01] said the remnant of the woman's seed
[1:27:05] being the 144,000 is the children of
[1:27:10] Israel The Remnant being the foolish
[1:27:13] virgin is the remnant left off of the
[1:27:16] Bride of Jesus Christ that's right
[1:27:19] that's not different meanings
[1:27:24] that's not different
[1:27:26] meaning that's a compound meaning of the
[1:27:29] same Revelation right cuz they both
[1:27:31] there in that tribulation have the
[1:27:33] testimony of Jesus Christ sure and all
[1:27:36] of them will be hunted down because of
[1:27:37] their testimony y the foolish virgin
[1:27:39] will be killed in the tribulation
[1:27:40] because of their testimony that's right
[1:27:42] the 144,000 and two witnesses be killed
[1:27:45] because of their testimony right
[1:27:49] amen is there enough in you and I to be
[1:27:52] tried for a testimony that's
[1:27:57] right all right and I'm not talking I've
[1:28:00] got some scripture I want to get into
[1:28:02] and I'm not talking about how goody
[1:28:04] goody you
[1:28:05] are cuz he ain't no goody goody in any
[1:28:09] of us
[1:28:11] amen bless God I don't do them things
[1:28:14] like I used to do
[1:28:17] wonderful that's your good
[1:28:21] neighbor
[1:28:22] right but does it make you a
[1:28:26] Christian no
[1:28:29] stand take on these things Remnant what
