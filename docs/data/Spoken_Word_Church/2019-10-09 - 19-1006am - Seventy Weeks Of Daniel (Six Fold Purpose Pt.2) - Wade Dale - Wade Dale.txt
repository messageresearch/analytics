Lord good to be here this morning we gotta do a little double duty today that's all right Lord be with us and blessing that'll be going to do part of his sister service so we give him a give him a day off from here anyway so good to be here in the house with Lord you can congratulate Jim when she gets up here because today's our 40th wedding anniversary [Applause] we were we were at the shows of festival yesterday and the lady was giving her condolences that anyway she said well I don't have to go through that forty again that's good that's a blessing but you know I was thinking coming up the road we live 20 years without the Lord the first 20 and we've lived the second 20 with the Lord in our life and to say it's been easier you can't really say that but you know how to handle it when you have the Lord in your life you really a lot of things you didn't know what how to handle when you didn't have the Lord in your life but we're just gonna that first 20 was was experiences and this 20 that we've just come through we've we've grown and and I tell you you just can't can't put a price on love even though it's filial love but if you got the agape level of the Lord then you'll have filial love for your wife because Bible tells you you you you love your wife this cross love you so remember that next time remember that next time whose is this Bob leave this up here Wednesday must have anyway at least it's got color to it it's not white but if you got your Bibles let's turn to the Book of Daniel let's begin the six fold purpose we kind of hit on it a little bit last Sunday but we're going to background for a few minutes and then we'll get into part two which we should be able to go one two three does anybody not have the chart that to give out last Sunday afternoon if you do not have yours raise hand raise it up high he's getting old he can't see either so just it'll be something we can go over the chart make sure you got it with you make some notes and whatever you want to do this afternoon we'll put the big chart up but I want us to go through all six folds today we'll do one two and three this morning and then we'll do 45 and sickness afternoon some very vital very important because it's the purpose of the redemption of Israel and the land and that's all of Daniel 70 weeks is really compiled in that last week of the redemption of Israel and the redemption of the land remember a couple of announcements October 26 I think they said October 26 does the Fall Festival done it this down at the park so remember that that's coming up in a few weeks November the second will be our second Youth Bible study will be starting maybe 2:30 or 3:00 o'clock instead of 3:30 because we didn't have time to answer all the questions and by the way we've already got questions piled up for this one coming up we don't have to sit and wait on anybody they've already sent them to us so well the youth has got a lot of questions and and you know if there's a Bible question there's got to be a Bible answer and we just believe you know as we're going to read here in a few minutes that face final resting places then the Word of God you can't use and you can say that you can say brother around said or the Prophet said that's okay but put it in the Bible because face final resting place lays in the Word of God not in what any man says but we know for one thing's for sure and let it be known from this pulpit that we believe that brother Branham was our prophet there was no one else not going to be anyone else he is the one that had the word for the hour and don't think you can correct him that's right that'd be like oh man that'd be like you trying to you be in the first grade trying to correct a rhodes scholar you know you just be just and i'm going to use this word brother i'm use it i took it out he said stupid he said that's just stupid six fold purpose part two all right everybody good say man all right here we go Daniel 921 let's bow our heads before we get started trying to let let everybody get in here Lewis kind of pulled the trigger a little too quick this morning but that's okay by our heads family Father we thank you Lord for all these things you give us give us a beautiful and a wonderful day to serve you and thank you Lord for all the lives that are standing here today Lord there's many testimonies there's many things we've been through the Lord you brought us do every one we praise your great name for that father we pray that you just be with us now in the Furman in this service you be the active participant or you be the one that does the revealing because without you here Lord we'll just we'll just have a little meeting but lord please reveal as I've always asked you Lord reveal yourself to the people reveal Christ in you the hope of glory of the bride Lord we pray that you just be with the ones that are not here brother Joe and some of them are going Lord brother Tim meetings you'll bless them Lord on the highways keep us all safe forgive us of our sins bless us in Jesus name Amen Daniel 921 says yes while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel who might send in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation always happens in the evening tonight and he informed me and taught with me and said Oh Daniel I am now come forth to give the skill and understanding now remember he didn't come to give him mass confusion he came to tell Daniel exactly what he was praying for and giving clarity on where he was standing and that's what I hope and pray that we do today at the beginning of the supplications that the commandment came forth and I am come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision seventy weeks are determined upon thy people whose that Jews and upon the holy city Jerusalem to do six things we're going to talk about three of them today number one is to finish the transgression look at these words finish to make an end of sin and reconciliation for iniquity let's remember those Finnish end and reconciliation all right and to bring in everlasting righteousness to distill up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem let me stop right here just a second when you go back up to 24 that is the restoration are the redemption of Israel in that one one verse everybody got that say man that is the restoration of Israel and the city is going to be done in that time of 70 weeks that all right say man well you gonna you better say a man called this a Bible okay all right and now what's going to happen in verse 25 he's going to tell Daniel how it's gonna happen but he's going all the way back to about five 30-something BC and bring it all the way up and tell Daniel what's going on so verse 24 is it I'll read this quote in just a few minutes brother Ram said that's all that's allotted to Israel and that's all that's allotted to the city is Daniel 9:24 now 9 25 26 and 27 tells you how it's gonna happen so keep that in your mind know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks so that's one seven week period and a sixty two week period the street shall be built again and the wall even in troublous times we're gonna get to this couple week and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself who was he cut off for not Israel they turned him down as for this is for us okay we'll read about that in a minute about the engrafting alright where was that but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come now who is that Titus shall destroy the city and the sanctuary totally destroy it like it had been destroyed during that 70 year captivity there buddy got there because when Daniels when Gabriel comes to Daniel in this moment of time the temple and the city is laying desolate according to second chronicles we'll read that in just a minute okay and the end of shall be with a flood and to the end of the war desolations are determined so there's gonna be a war somewhere and he shall confirm the covenant with many now who's that he he is the Antichrist because God won't confirm a covenant and then break it this man confirms a covenant but for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate he's gonna walk into the temple the Pope is gonna walk in this Gentile Pope is gonna walk into the temple and say I'm God oh boy think what's going on with those 144,000 Jews and all the others for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate so some time after that what he does what the what the I say Pope but the Antichrist does when he breaks that covenant we'll see this afternoon that's when you're gonna have the Battle of Armageddon alright and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation now what is the consummation of 70 weeks of Daniel not when the not when the two witnesses get finished preaching it's when they walk into the Millennium that's the end of the consummation and that determined shall be poured out upon the desolate you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word because the one attack we got a lot to read but really a lot of it is scripture for some of you that's got the quotes in your hand but we will we will read them now I want you to two less background just for a minute as some of the other ones are coming in mm-hmm we know that there was a prophecy given and I told you this in the history part of this of this teaching if we go to 2nd chronicles 36 if you'll pull it up there verse 17 through 21 since therefore he brought upon him the king of the Chaldees who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion upon young men are made an old man or him that's due for age he gave them all into his hand and all the vessels of the house of God great and small and the treasures of the house of the Lord that was everything Solomon had built everything he had overlaid with gold everything he had overlaid with silver it's going to be gone the temples going to be broke down and the treasures of the king of his princess all these he brought to Babylon and they burnt the house of God and break down the wall of Jerusalem because remember a wall is a fortification it's kind of like us having a security system but once you break that security system down there's no city that's safe without a wall back then all right because you got to remember this is back to the Jews back in into 500 BC and they burnt the house of God and break down the walls of Jerusalem and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof and I think all that was left over if you'll continue looking in the history all that was left over with Solomon's porch and it was all made out of concrete so it you couldn't burn it but Solomon's porch is still there today that's the only thing was left from the original temple with Solomon's porch and really it was just the steps that go up to the porch so in other words man we will get into this in a little while when we get into the streets being built in trouble as times man has always hated the Jews but they know if they can keep them out of their homeland that God's not going to deal with them even the Gentiles that around them that that's why they had a sword in one hand and a trial in the other hand they were building the wall and they were trying to keep the white people away from knocking the wall down because they knew if and we even know now like where brother brown says God doesn't he only deals with Jerusalem our Jews when they're in their homeland all right so what man has been trying to do for hundreds and thousands of years is keep Israel scattered well it's Satan doing it you know that through the people is trying to keep Israel scattered but now we see that they're back in their homeland and they're not going to leave this time there's going to be 144,000 taken in a rapture of what's going on at the moment there buddy okay with that and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof and then that had escaped from the stored carried away to Babylon so anyway the ones he didn't kill he picks him up and takes him to Babylon and Daniel or his mommy and daddy one is included in that bunch because he's in captivity now in Daniel 9 everybody got that same and he'd been in captivity 68 years so so he was probably born in captivity and then they had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon where there were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia because remember this kingdom is cursed another kingdom comes in Nebuchadnezzar gets he gets destroyed actually remember Nebuchadnezzar God said you've made yourself too high and mighty I was just reading it the other day he said you're gonna eat grass for seven years your fingernails are gonna grow out and you're gonna grow hair all over your back and you're gonna eat count on me eat like a cow for seven years well then he comes back into power and then his son Belshazzar comes in and Belshazzar is the one that God wrote many many tinkle of purse in and said that you've weighed in the balances of found wanting well he dies so then now what happens is the Medes and the Persians come and take over according to scripture because remember chronicles this is written back before it even happens this is the prophecy everybody okay with that where they were serviced to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her Sabbath's remember we're talking about two things here the land and the people nobody got that say men to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her Sabbath's for as long as she laid desolate she kept Sabbath to fulfil 62 and 10 which is 70 years all right this 70 year of captivity and remember when in Genesis 29 if you'll pull that up we'll kind of get finished get through this background pretty quick Genesis 29 verse 27 it talks about fulfil her week and we will give thee this for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven years that Jacob served seven years for Rachel and he fulfilled her week which was what seven years so the prophet of God had to just look in the Bible I'm sure the angel of the Lord said hey have you read it over here and in Genesis where it says that one week equals seven years all right because you know brother Branham just didn't come up with that he had to get it out of the Bible listen brother Branham was a Bible prophet he did not now sure he looked at Larkin and he looked at your eyes Smith and he looked at all these different ones and he said I agree with some of them he even in doctor Scofield he said there's some things I agree some things I don't agree with he said and they were scholars for their time but see there had to be a prophet to tie up all the loose ends here's the important part brother Branham tied up all the loose ends that was loose because remember look Clarence Larkins chart that he drew before brother Branham came on the scene is the exact same chart that brother Branham drew for the Daniell seventy weeks but remember Clarence Larkin was a Trinitarian right so see that part he was off had to be a prophet come in had to be a prophet to come in to bring one God back in line to bring water baptism back in line to bring all the no eternal health all those things that some of those had probed that and missed there were certain things they got right they weren't false prophets they were right for their time moody Sankey Finney Calvin all those great men you listen they're not gonna be in hell they're their bride their bride okay the same way with clear Larkin I would say his teachings are well good but they're not all exactly right that's why we put our resting place on the Word of God that the prophet of God gave us clarity while he was here and left us 1100 sermons so in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound where's he gonna sound he's not gonna sound from a tape recorder he's gonna same for me and you alright just the way it is that's what the Bible says amen so face final resting place is in the Word of God so we take what the Word of God says so now let's go back to Daniel nine one we're still in where this is where Daniels prayer in the first year of Darius now there Sebring Darius the Mede Persian Chaldeans and the different ones it's not Nebuchadnezzar he's already gone off the scene and died once is in the first year of Darius the son of a source of the seat of the Medes which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans in the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of years where the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet what was Daniel doing Daniel was literally reading Jeremiah's quote book he was reading Jeremiah sermons if they went out of tape-recorder Jeremiah's tape-recorder would have been there but Daniel got a revelation but you know where he needed a revelation from he needed it from God it wasn't just a reading it was where he the angel Gabriel why didn't Gabe real come to give him what skill and understanding all right so God sends message during this day to give a skill and understanding thereby all right with that the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of years were of the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet that he would accomplish in 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem and I set my face into the Lord to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting in sackcloth and ashes and we know the prayer continues down and because of Daniels prayer nice thing about this yesterday we we I don't believe in luck as being a Christian I don't believe in being lucky I believe in being fortunate but I believe we all got a choice but God knew what our choice was before we got here we don't so we continued to pray that some I asked brother Branham on tape I was listening to this brother Brown if predestination is like you said then why are you preaching he said I'm throwing the net he's I'm throwing the net to get the ones that are out there that that's kind of you know out in the in the water he said I'm throwing the net and he said bringing them in so they're taking here from God which i think is wonderful because predestination is you know preed their term and destination but it's because of foreknowledge that God knew what you would do he knew you'd want he knew Daniel that's what in the whole point is he knew Daniel as soon as he come to that two years left it was close to getting out of there he knew Daniel was going to absolutely open the windows up throw the sackcloth and ashes go to fasting and praying and that's why he had Gabriel standing there ready to go give him a message all right same way with you and I we were we were screaming for what clarity we were screaming for a profit because you know what we're getting ready to get out of here and you're not going to get out of here with all these loose ends that were left with Larkin and Smith and all those different ones we had a profit come to give us clarity all right so now let's look that's why I mean I'm telling you this because this is one of the most contentious doctrines that brother Brown ever have because most time when people get ready to leave the message the first thing they say is he was wrong in Daniel 7 tea leaves hey they just don't have clarity right because that you know what I it was kind of funny when we had the ministers meeting several years ago they were denying quotes and we were bringing all the quotes in and they were throwing quotes out okay that's what I told him I said I said he preached three sermons just for nothing no if you read that if you go through and look and listen to read Daniel seventy weeks go from Gables instruction seat full purpose to the seventh week I got laying in there it is the most positive the man hardly it has ever preached I'm sure this thus saith the Lord this has got to happen this has got to happen you know I mean that there you know if you listen to that their commentary of the people that get ready to leave the message they say it was wrong it's like he was and don't get me wrong a bumbling idiot he was not he was absolutely the most positive he had ever been because he had to get that out of the way to get to the seven seals which nobody had ever preached all right so he couldn't be wrong we just didn't understand what he was saying but I believe we do understand what he was saying and then I believe we have clarity we have to have clarity you can we're not going to get out of here with fear and uncertainty fear and uncertainty is what kept us here from the Garden of Eden till this day it's fear and uncertainty so we need to get rid of that so now let's start with number one try to get finished here by 11:30 and I got this afternoon so that's why I like this now there's our lesson for the next three or four meetings whatever the Lord will reveal seventy of weeks now I'll ask dr. Phil tonight put up my board so I'll be able to mark it up no we know I've got to I've got the chart in there we'll give it out next Sunday I don't want you to miss it now you got to study with me and study deeper you'll miss it I want to draw it out here on the blackboard then you bring your pencils and paper and write down these dates these times and all about it now the seventy of weeks begins now get this after the church is taken out now that should not stumble you because the charts are holding in your hand we've already left the building we've already left this earth when those two prophets start preaching to redeem Israel and redeem the city we're going all this other is not filler but it's just like I said before Daniel 9:24 is right here but now 25 26 and 27 you got to go back and get the history of how you got here everybody got that say ma'am the history of how you got right here if y'all would look this way I'm not over there I'm over here you don't mind I'd like some participation look I mean if it doesn't bother you you can just leave if you want to not gonna bother me any if you think you don't need it I do so I'm gonna stay right here now the 70 weeks begins after the church is taken out now everybody understand that say Amen now after the church is taken out because from revelation 6:1 to revelations 1921 is connected with the seventy of weeks therefore we must often explain it before we go further we must stop in this plane why these 70 weeks because if you don't you'll miss the seals you mister trumpets you mr. miles what you'll miss the positioning of it okay you'll miss the positioning of when one comes in one goes out that's my brother Brown was trying to preach the trumpets trying to preach the trumpets trying to he said I'll take a whole week God said you already preached him spiritually or supernaturally in the sixth seal he preached the trumpets they preached the Feast of the trumpets which is a little bit different than preaching seven trumpets individual you know why because it's all to Israel we're not even here when it happens all right revelation 6:1 or 1921 is connected with the seventy of weeks therefore we must stop and explain you'll miss the trumpets you miss the vowels to play three unclean spirits like frogs three woes casting out the red dragon and the woman in the Sun you'll miss it all if you don't cuz it takes place right here in this 70th week that's this week you've got in your hand the chart that you got that's the 70th week no there's no half weeks in here okay there's whole weeks there's no half weeks in the Bible now the prophet Daniel had been in Bible in for 68 years you won't run references back and save yourself time of looking it up 68 years he went into captivity in BC 606 and when the vision came to him was what BC 538 about 38 from 606 least 68 68 years he had been in Babylon amongst heathens and still had the victory we can't stay an hour about that number two Gabriel's instructions to Daniel the Jews that we know that's not the real Jew the real Jews that real Orthodox who is not has not defiled himself with the things of the world who's not won out and joined the church's reason I'm reading this cuz watch that's the ones that's returning under living on cheese and bread it's not the Wall Street you they stayed in America they stayed where the money was at all right these are the honest ones that come back this is where to come back on the wings of an eagle remember they couldn't get on the airplane brother branham that was back then transworld airway or TWA or whatever it was he said we go back on the angle eagle's wings so they're gonna go back they went back over there on those airplanes not allowed in the old city had to build them a city on the side and a no-man's land well machine guns pointing both ways brother Dale's been there they do they got Palestine they got this they got that but she's beginning to put forth her buzz amen and amen the timings in hand there's Ishmael and Isaac stand and they're fussing about the land so we got to get the land right too see you and I don't have a land we don't have a continuance city we're looking for a city whose builder and maker is God we're not looking for a Jerusalem that is natural over there sure we're going to go over there and live but it's not ours it's the Jews the whole millennium is to the Jews will read that this afternoon and get some clarity on that I think they won't let them come to old Jerusalem you have to go there first and let them explain all that to you the Arabs then take you over in the other side that's this most children but wait that's coming a time when God's children is going to take her over that's right Jerusalem will be rebuilt again scripture says be rebuilt the daily sacrifice will be set up that's what they're working on right now and the Antichrist will make a covenant for them last 7 weeks we know that's like seven years it's not seven weeks we know that and in the midst of it he'll break that covenant turn them in all into Catholicism the abomination will spread over the whole thing like that and then the end shall be watch all right let's start with the fifth sixth fold purpose let's read it now again seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city two things to finish the transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in everlasting righteousness to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy so inside of those seventy weeks are the 490 years are we okay with this 70 times seven is 490 years seventy weeks times one week equals seven years everybody got that 70 times seven is 490 that's why they asked Jesus they said are we supposed to forgive our brother seven times he said seventy times seven he was telling him exactly how long that they were gonna be in captivity and hey he was exactly telling them what Daniel was saying but they didn't catch it he said nope you gotta forgive seventy times seven you know what he was saying Bob he was saying I'm gonna forgive you in 70 times seven so at the end of the 490 years the land and the people will be redeemed back if I got that 70 times said in the seventy weeks of Daniel will be the redemption of Israel and the city the people and the city everybody got that same an alright so seventy weeks are determined upon thy city and upon the holy city to do six things all right six things finishes the redemption of Israel there buddy got that say man all right now let's read number three just to reiterate what I was saying a minute ago in the entombment first time we wish to look draw your attention to is the infallibility of God's Word God keeps his word to the letter and tonight we want to fast in our thoughts on that that God keeps his word we can rest assure of anything that God has said in his word to be the truth and faith does not rest upon the shifting sands of men's idea or man's theology let me read that one more time faith there's not rest upon the shifting sand of man's idea or man's theology but it has its final resting place on the unmovable rock of God's eternal word the word number for God hiding himself in simplicity and remember that's the same spirit from the days of Noah that says there's no rain we can shoot the moon with instruments and there's no rain but if God said there'd be rain there for faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seeing if faith takes its final resting place on the Word of God there's where it finds its resting place so the resting place of you me and every other believer is on the Word of God and then anything that you think are the Prophet thinks or any man thinks if it's contrary to the Word of God it's wrong that's why brother Brown said you can't be you can't both be right one has to be right one has to be wrong but you cook you both can't be right when it's contrary to the Word of God you can't both be right in the word and you look in the word and you say well no let's not there's only three and a half years left of the 70 weeks of Daniel woolens that's not what the Bible says Bible says there's one week left of the to make the covenant from the Antichrist to the Jews that we're fixing to talk about so you have to make a lot of people what they're doing is they're trying to make the Bible fit the quote that's wrong in backwards that's what Satan did that's what Satan did Satan's quote he quoted part of what God said right if either quoted exactly what God said he'd have been right but he only quoted part of what God said added a little bit to it and he took Eve down and the whole human race went down so now in a 6-volt purpose let's read number five seventy weeks are determined upon by people for what purpose now this is brother Branham for what whose people was that determined upon Daniel's people the Jews so you got people Jews uh-huh and look upon not only Daniel but upon Daniels holy city Daniels holy city now class what was Daniel's holy city Jerusalem so when we look at the seventy weeks of Daniel it has to restore the people and the city inside of those seventy weeks because seventy weeks are determined to do these six things everybody got that say ma'am we're gonna take you a little bit slow so you make sure you understand we we flew through it before sometimes but maybe we need to kind of solidify it a little bit like brother Richard was in the back back there and he's I think I've got the original cassettes from nineteen seventy four of where daddy preached the Daniel seventy weeks and it ain't no different than what I'm telling you now what do you think I got to study from yeah I stole his sermon but God gives you a revelation where you can put things together but but like I said this is not a new revelation this has been since back then so so it's okay but we're gonna keep going until everybody gets it amen cuz brother Brown said if there's a question in people's mind there's a Bible answer for that question alright that's why we're putting a lot of that's why a lot of these are script sure's that we're gonna read today all right now let's look at number six well it talks about the redemption redemption of Jews and the city keep that in your mind if you keep those two things in your mind you'll understand this six fold purpose and you'll understand that there's not three and a half years left after the rapture of the whole of Daniel 70 last week 70th week because the Bible said there's not a man according to the Bible anybody questions you on that say read Daniel 9 let's see what it says and then if they give you another quote said let's read Daniel 9 don't don't get off for that because the Bible is not going to change 6 full purpose number 6 now I want to know friends that strike that striking on these things I'm certainly leaving out weeks of teaching but just kind of hitting it so where the weather cools off for a little bit we can get into the seventh seal seven by seven trumpets all these things I can refer back and say do you remember on the seventy weeks of Daniel now he does that many times in the seals and I'm back with you one more time again I want somebody to produce a quote where brother Branham says I was wrong then and I'm correcting it now now there's several times in the seals we just went through them and I read you the quotes where brother Brown said this was all the way away from my from my thought he talked to 104 he talked to this field you was the Saints under the altar well God had to correct him on that he taught the first seal he thought that was the white horse rider it was the Antichrist Godhead but you know what he came out and told us that what a man that come out and say I was wrong all that time when God corrected me on this when I show me one time he said he corrected me on Daniel 70 weeks he did not because he didn't correct you can't correct the word you just cannot correct the word so he says do you remember on the seventy weeks of Daniel do remember the church age when it went up and what taken place and the seventy weeks of Daniel covers from the going up of the church until the coming back of the church that space is one it covers not all seventy of weeks of Daniel part of it what he's saying is that part that we just said we got to go back to 606 and bring your dates and all the time when Christ was cut off and the Jew and the Gentiles were engrafted in that's the whole part of that chart but but that's all the 70 weeks there is for the redemption of Israel and the city is that one last week that's what you'll say right here all right look let's keep reading because remember from revelations for one look at me from revelations for one to 1921 we're gone we're not on earth for one there's a door open in heaven and we go up in it that's the rapture and we don't come back to revelations 19 you said well why is it in there this is what this is we get the spiritual part we get two allegories we get the the types and the shadows of the different things that's going on because remember you say well why did you preach for a year and a half on the seals if we're not even going to be here you got a spiritual part you got to get because it's a plan of redemption how you gonna throw out part of the plan of redemption you cannot throw out everything's got a we're redeemed Israel's redeemed the earth is redeemed remember everything fell in the Garden of Eden there was nothing nothing made it unscathed everything fell from Adam all the way down to Jesus Christ and he was even living in a falling body and it had to be redeemed it had to be made eternal but he gave his soul ransom that was eternal baby thank God in the 70 weeks of Daniel covers from the going up of the church until the coming back of the church this afternoon we'll get into that cuz this is taken up into a North the most holy he gets real clear on that seventy weeks are determined now there was a sixth full purpose of his visit telling him what was going to come to pass now there was a six full purpose of his coming now tonight I think we'll leave off over here in the scriptures where he was at this morning where's the sixth full purpose he's not gonna read it again in other words let's go down to the next paragraph and 70 of weeks and seventy weeks are determined upon by people now remember that is all the journey of the Israelites will have on this earth they are determined seventy weeks what for 90 years right 70 weeks is just determined that's always lauded to the Jews upon thy people and upon the holy city therefore these 70 weeks now this is brother Branham now don't miss it it will reveal from that time to the end of the Jews and also to the end of Jerusalem until there will be a new city built now when is the new city going to be built listen they've tore every one of them down and they're going to when we leave they're gonna tear the one down this over there remember they're gonna drop a bomb prophet of God said right into the mosque of Omar well it's right in the middle of Jerusalem right it'll blow the whole city up then what then you come into the Millennial temple that we're going to talk about this afternoon where there'll be a Millennial temple bill that there'll be no sacrifices made there'll be no there'll be no yeah there'll be a Holy of Holies but you're gonna be sitting in it Wow Wow oh I hope we get this real deep tonight or determined upon thy people in the holy city to do what now we're gonna start into it just a minute but I want you to see this part how is this gonna happen some somebody shows up when we leave there's two prophets show up they're not preaching now cause God's not dealing with the Gentiles and the Jews at the same time he's dealing with us it's what I said before I it's not I don't say it's a waste of time to go to Israel but that's not our part that's not for us why don't we get ourselves ready to get out of here get ourselves ready to get out of here then God can go to the Jews he's already promised that I'm reading it right here revelations 11 verse 1 and that was given to me a reed and like them to a rod and the angel students that arrives and measured the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein so guess what's going to happen they're gonna build that temple they're gonna put it back together as soon as we leave that's why the Pope's gonna go over there and say hey let's make a covenant and the Israel's gonna go well you've got our stuff you've got our menorah and you've got our Holy of Holies you've got our lavish you you get down there in the basement in the Vatican somewhere so Pope is gonna say okay let's make a covenant you know what he's got in his mind he's gonna take over so he gives them all that stuff back they put the temple back together I just read you that quote back over here a little bit it says Jerusalem will be rebuilt again the daily sacrifice will be set up and the Antichrist will make a covenant for them last seven weeks or seven years and in the midst he'll break the Covenant they're gonna get everything back together we'll talk about that in a little while but let's go to revelations a level one verse two but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles and the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months now watch forty-two months three and a half years and I will give power unto my two witnesses we know to the prophet of God that is the spirit of Moses and the spirit of Elijah on to Jews nothing to do with the Gentiles listen folks even now we're dogs to them we're not even they hate us being even over there they treated that in them pretty bad you know while they were over there and that was back in the 90s think about now because you know it's two-spirit though that's them Jews it's not Christian Jews they're just used hey we're Jews and I will give power to my two witnesses and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and threescore days which is what twelve hundred and sixty days and if you don't mind somebody was asking me a question the other day I've got 1260 days that's that prophecy that we just talked about revelations 11 but there is 1260 days on this side to do you can drop that in there what oh I'm sorry you can drop that in there sorry John that's my boy so you can going right 1260 days up here because it's 1260 three and a half years and three and a half years of 360 days to a year not not 365 and the fourth everybody got that saying man all right so it's 1260 if you're riding on you chart 12c in 1260 all right everybody got that all right the two witnesses are going to do what they're going to do three things just like God come to us on the day of Pentecost that brother Dale has been preaching for months now what's he gonna do pull it up pull it back up to where I got the three that's exactly what they're gonna do to the Jews they're going to preach justification they're gonna preach sanctification they're gonna preach the baptism of the holy ghost they're gonna receive not the message of the hour us know they're gonna receive their message now sure they're gonna hear from that brother branham was here and there they're probably quoting but they're not gonna go over there like I said I'm sorry they're gonna go over and just play tapes there's two human people gonna go over there and they're going to preach and fire is gonna proceed from their mouth and whatever they say that's what's gonna happen you know what they're untouchable for 1260 days nothing can kill them don't you think I've said before the Mossad the FBI the CIA the KGB the BFI and whatever you want to call them they're all gonna be won't to kill them two guys right cuz all they're going to extend and go I'll open up the ground and you know big troop coming at you they go open up the ground like Moses did same thing suck up a thousand men at a time they're not gonna they're going to be untouchable for 1260 days don't you think this whole world is going to be mad at them amen cuz they have power to do all the shut up to heaven don't rain for three and a half years you think we're having a problem out here now think about three and a half years of that and the Bible says even in the largest time do didn't even fall on the ground they wouldn't even do on the ground for three and a half years so they're going to preach justification sanctification to baptism the Holy Ghost and we're going to show too that if you look at your chart we're going to show that they what in through their message they finish the transgression of Israel they make an event of sins of Israel and they reckons they make reconciliation for iniquity so they finish an end and reconcile and now what God did to you he puts you through justification chopped off your past sins got rid of what your old you your old you sins he in your hello you he got really over you since the oh you still there the ol you don't dial right here but you take sanctification what's that cleaned and set aside for service then the Holy Ghost is going to come in and fill them some hoard during that 1260 days 144,000 twelve thousand out of each tribe of Israel is going to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they're going to go in the rapture if they're going to be killed along with the two witnesses all right so let's go real quick finish the transgression all right everybody got that this is the what transgression means in the Bible in other words look at yourself in your justification put this also under the first seal where the white horse rider you look at justification what is that as recognized by center as God forgives what did he do what did God forgive he forgave your past sins enough for you to realize you were lost and then you moved into sanctification he gives you a new heart he gives you a new spirit not the Holy Spirit he gives you a new heart and a new spirit you move into sanctification well that's what's going to happen to the children of Israel during this time the Jews are going to be preached and they're gonna realize they transgressed they're going to realize they sinned but look I love what it says finish god finish your transgression when he justifies you now look at number seven six full purpose now if we go back into Daniel again we'll find out that in Daniel we find out the twenty fourth verse to finish the transgression to finish what to finish Israel's transgression now look this is not to the world there's not one Gentile going to be saved after the rapture after we leave so this is the only brother right to the 144,000 is not gonna be 144 thousand and ten but you understand what I mean I mean there's gonna be women and children there too but at 144 thousand heads of the household are going to be saved so let's be technical about it ok to finish Israel's transgression what is the transgress it's to go against something a transgress against me is to do a wrong to me what did we do our transgression was I live 20 years a transgressor I did wrong to God but accepted it is same in 12 years old or whatever the age of accountability is but I didn't do that you didn't do that so you transgressed against turns dressed against you as to do it wrong to you so Israel didn't wrong to God and in this 70th week now did he say half he said in this 70th week what's going to happen God is going to finish the transgression of Israel finish the transgression we'll be turning away the ungodliness from Jacob and then all Israel will be born again all of them will receive the Holy Ghost that buddy Scott has finished a transgression you got to start somewhere he's gonna finish the transgression cuz remember those who is justified he's already glorified all right same way with you you and I that's why the type is to me and you this 70 weeks of Daniel is a type to me and you of how we get to our Redemption but what happens to Israel they get a definite space of time and you got to put the land in our land is what you're sitting in today this is the land of the Gentiles that God won't still inhabit he'd sure he loves that City over there but he had rather inhabit you then it habit a house but he had to spark that way with Israel he had to give them Moses had to go and get a tabernacle put it up the Holy of Holies the priest would go in one time he would make an atonement for all of Israel that's how it had to begin but remember Christ came and made an atonement once for all took care of every bit of that so we don't have to build a building he built the building right here Hebrews 10 5 a body thou has prepared me so God can Tabernacle in it that's what brother Dale was preaching on the statue a perfect man he comes in and habits but you got to remember there's doors and doors and doors in doors you know so Israel did it wrong to God he will turn the ungodliness from Jacob then all Israel will be born again now you say oh he said all Israel hundred and forty-four thousand go back to the Bible all right all of them will receive the Holy Ghost that's true 144,000 will receive the Holy Ghost Romans 11 verse 21 let's look and see what the Bible says about the ungodliness of Jacob for if God spared not of the natural branches took heed lest he also spare not they behold therefore the goodness and severity of God on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise that also shall be cut off he's talking to the Gentiles we were grafted in we were the wild olive branch and I know you didn't can't see it but I'm gonna reach right here and get this I'd hand these out but you look at this and what look at me you see that part right there that's the engrafting of the Gentiles that's what Paul's talking about we this is Israel as always the olive tree right if there had not been a Gentile bride this is what would have happened that would have been 490 running years complete 490 running years Israel would have been redeemed and they would have had a future home to go to but remember God had in his mind a Gentile bride so we had to be grafted in this tree but now remember these branches were cut off at Calvary Jews the Jews got cut off after 62 weeks Messiah will be cut off who cut him off who killed him the Jews kill sure you say well we killed him and no literally the Jew said let his blood be on us we'll get to in just a second but this is in grafting Paul's talking about but watch what he says and they also if they abide not still and unbelief shall be graffed it in for God is able to graft them in again he's got to finish that week he's got to finish that last part cuz they turned him down right here at Calvary they turned him down cut him off but he's gonna graft them back in that's what he says her hair shall be grafted in for God is able to graft them in again for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and we're grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree that was us into a good olive tree how much more shall these which be the natural branch be grafted into their own tree because the tree is Jewish we were just grafted in the wild olive branch was just grafted in to live off the life amen but I would not brethren this you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in so God blinded his children we know on the fifth seal we were talking about that God blinded their whole of Israel's eyes he is not dealing with them during this whole time but he's going to graft them back in when we leave when we leave they're been blind but what's going to how that was your eyes open because remember before you were born again you were blind some person somebody preached the sermon somebody read a scripture somebody put you under conviction because of what the word said and what your eyes were open so through two prophets on that twin that 1260 days they're going to preach and sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and their eyes are going to be open we read it in just a little while the blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in and so all Israel shall be saved now Paul all Israel know we realized that's 144,000 as it is written this will come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins house their sins gonna be taken away to prophet 6 full purpose all right there buddy got that say man all right just for a minute here make an end of sin number to remember finish it when God justifies you he never remembers what you did from that point back hey men God's got to forget what Israel did to him you say that was horrible what you did to him was worse so let's don't crow like brother Branham says let's don't grow too much you said all them poor Liz realized they were blinded well so were you until God opened your eyes you were blinded and you know until you had an end of sin watch what this is going on watch how this I saw this the other day and it really touched my heart so let's see if it'll touch yours because remember where did they do their bottle number to make an end of sins now let's read again Daniel to finish transgression and make an end of sins now when God makes an end of something it's over the man when God makes an end of sin end of sins it's over now let's read Daniel 9 that's his second purpose of coming first to finish Israel's transgression and make an end of sin where did Israel sin where did they do their vile sin where did they separate himself from God now he goes to Mathew mm-hmm he looks says 24 but it's 27 we know that so he says here Matthew 27 the Gospel of Matthew so let's go to Matthew 27 21 and let's read this but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas and destroy Jesus the governor answered and said unto them we're never the twain well then I release unto you they said now whose day it is a congregation of the chief priests and elders of Israel not Gentiles the Jews is what came to him and said here we want him crucified because what Pilate he's trying to give them back to them Pilate said unto them what shall I do with this Jesus which is called Christ they all said unto him let him be crucified and the governor said why what evil has he done but they cried out the more sane let him be crucified when Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this just man see to it then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and our children okay on us and our children so for two thousand years that prophecy has been running it's been a running prophecy let his blood be on us and our children in other words every generation from that time forward God has cut them off or blinded them let's look at something for you just for men what is sanctification what is sanctification red blood red blood cleaned and set aside clean and set aside what the red blood the red horse-rider sanctification is what red let's watch this let's go back to number nine there's where they done it he was making the end of sin for them how could he do anything else but forgive them knowing that he had to blind their eyes that we could come in it's like his own children calling for his blood listen the very blood they were calling for it's what sanctified them they were calling their own sanctification they just didn't know that and that is horrible but that's the best thing they could have said God knew that was going to be the Gentiles come in but when they said let his blood be on us he kept them for 2,000 years sure they went through horrible things but he's going to come out of this thing in sanctification through two prophets and by the cleansing of the shed blood they're going to see that blood was shed at Calvary for them no one had to blind him so they could come in it's like his own children calling for his blood and they were blinded and he knowed they were blinded that's the reason he cried for forgiveness for them forgive them father for they don't know what they're doing they were blind for our sake they were made blind in their unbelief they did this but when they see him again amen put an end to sin what is sin unbelief they did not believe it was the Messiah they could not see him to be the Messiah yet he done ever signed the Messiah was supposed to do but they could not see it they were blind now let's go to Zechariah 13 let's read a few scriptures right here Zechariah 13:1 says in that day there should be a fountain open to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and uncleanness Zechariah 13 let's continue read verse 6 though let's skip it down a little bit there you go and one shall say unto Him what are these wounds in that hand then he shall answer those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends awake o sword against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow saith the lord of hosts smite the Shepherd and the Sheep shall be scattered now we remember I didn't get this in here because I thought it wouldn't have time but let me just interject right here brother Branham said Jesus quoted this very scripture but he stopped right here just like he said today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears and he was talking about you know and brother Graham said Jesus stopped because the rest of it will be full delightful field later well see he couldn't say the rest of it he couldn't turn his hand to the little ones which is the Benjamin group 144,000 he turned it to us and then now we read and I will turn my hand upon the little ones Jesus couldn't say that because he went what they already rejected him he was headed toward the Gentiles but he knew that when all this was over where the Gentiles had left that he's going to turn back to the little ones the little Benjamin group amen that all rights a man all right look let's go to number 10 they'll be show so ashamed of their self when they stand there and see that very one that they crucified in the night standing there their own precious Joseph they'll be such morning they'll say where did you get those scars he said in the house of my friends see what I mean to make an end of sin of unbelief that's what he's coming for in this 7870 of year of Daniel made corrects itself 70th week 70th we not halfway 70th week rather coming to make an end of sin put it away you understand now what's the first to finish the transgression to make an end of sin now number three is going to be making reconciliation we'll get to that in about would give me about five more minutes but sanctification let's pull up the nation this is what I was talking about sanctification red blood they said let his blood be on us they were calling their own sanctification but now remember God had to cut them off because they didn't believe he was doing it remember brother Graham told us he said Christ died at Calvary for all of us justified us sanctified us right we just remember it was applied to us during the church ages but it was not applied to the Jews until we leave then it becomes applied to them he did not listen the day of atonement Christ don't have to get back on the cross you don't have to kill the major sacrifice he's already been killed at Calvary they're going to look and say where did you get those wounds and and this says well in the house and my friends but you know what the two prophets are going to do they're going to turn them right back to that very statement and they you're gonna say you put it on yourself you said let his blood be on us and thank God you did because covered you for 2,000 years and now your eyes are going to be open Jenny wait with us if you'll follow a lesson if you're born again you when we hit these these things of justification you'll say that's exactly what happened to me may not be exact same statement I make or brother Dale makes but when I became sanctified I knew somebody was cleaning me up and it was not me so they're going to come to a place to where they're going to say through those two prophets they're going to see Christ now physically you're not going to see him physically you're seeing them through a fivefold ministry and through your life that lives it back out let his blood the Red Horse let his blood be on us whoa hey let his blood be on me keep me sanctified keep me to a place to where what there's your daily sanctification just keep what keep going keep going keep going brother branham even says he said all they're trying to do away with the blood listen you do away with the blood you've took yourself out from under any type of keeping you clean I want to stay under there and just let it completely just run all over me so did they but when you know we looked at that you say well that's the most hideous thing they did that's all they could do to be to be where they can be sanctified when we leave where they can look back and the two prophets go there is where it happened Calvary is where this man called Jesus sanctified you could look just where did you get two wounds he had already been crucified the wounds what he was at Calvary he got wounded remember he was wounded for your transgressions bruised for your iniquities say with them all right let's go to acts 2:38 and Peter said unto them repent because we got one more level to go to right we got one more repent and be baptized everyone your name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise isn't to you who was he talking to Jews because remember the first the first bunch that got the baptism as Holy Ghost were Jews they fell on the Jews first the Bible says then on the Gentiles so there was an overlap you're going to see overlaps everything has an overlap alright there's an overlap of the Gentiles coming in there was 120 in the upper room they were all Jews but there was three thousand downstairs it was of many nations but remember they were the spokesperson so it was a Jewish first run in other words of the baptism of Holy Ghost but there was a time in there where Paul says look we're closing the door God's closing the door on you because I've come to you and you've rejected me what to the Jews he said lo I turn to the Gentile will see that opened up that time of the Gentiles where you and I could come in right but there is an overlap in there for the promise isn't to you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call us do this real quick to make reconciliation for iniquity that's number three look on your chart you got you got to reconcile the people it's going to take 1 2 3 finish the transgression make an end of sin and reconciliation for iniquity listen God talks about reconciling what's what's reconciling that means you've been apart for a while he can't talk to you sure he can talk to you a little bit but he really wants when he gives you the baptism to my Holy Ghost he is intimately communing with you hallelujah intimately communing with you and that's what he wants to do those 144,000 to make reconciliation for iniquity real quick what is that to cover to purge make an atonement make reconciliation cover over with pitch to cover over atone for sin make an atonement now when the priest went in to make the atonement he didn't have to go back the next day they were covered for a whole year according to what God had told him right but now God Christ went into the Holy of Holies one time and he's covered us for an eternity all right so they don't have to go back to sacrifices that's what's gonna kill them 144,000 they're gonna be killed by their own people when they walk into the temple and say that's not it right this the sacrificing of goats and animals and all them ones though those fonts Jews have been trying for 2,000 years to get that back together and all of a sudden they get it all back together and as a group walks in and goes god I ain't even in this God's in this now he's not even in that building he's in this now Lord they're gonna kill him 144,000 just like they'll kill us even not maybe not physically but they can kill you influence to cover over atone for sins to make an atonement so what's it gonna do when he gives you the baptism the Holy Ghost you receive the atonement the man right you receive the atonement Christ doesn't have to get back on the cross he's already covered you you just gotta accept it number 11 let's do this real quick six full purpose to make reconciliation for iniquity iniquity is doing wrong as they did at the cross he made reconciliations but it will not be applied to them why it wasn't applied back then he did it remember he don't have to go get back up on Calvary when the two witnesses hit the earth they're going to point them back to the true atonement that happened 2,000 years ago and said that's where you did your own it was not applied to them why because they were blinded and could not see it and the Prophet says we why did they blend you said well maybe today because I'm blind you're willfully blind they were blinded because God blinded them see if God blinds you that's why he's got to give that fifth seal Jew eternal life because he's the one that blinded him man didn't blind them God Himself blinded those Jews so that you and I could come in so he has to give them eternal life cuz he said just guard sorry brother Larry put your hearing aid him I'm about done well maybe today because I'm blind you're willfully blind they were blind because God blinded them but you're blind because you're willfully blind there's no reconciliation for you if you believe not I am he Jesus said you'll die in your sin he talks back to talks about in the days of Zechariah listen let's skip on down number twelve six-fold purpose now Jesus quoted that scripture here it is I didn't put it I did put it in here smite the Shepherd and scared of the Sheep but notice the next paragraph he just quoted that much of it but watch what the next sentence of it says and that's part of it I will turn my hand to the little ones what the Benjamin group that's coming up now I will turn my hand to the little ones see we can we can almost say it today that scriptures fulfilled because they're hidden he's headed toward them we're about over here we're about done there's no more Church agents no more prophets to come it's just getting ready to get out of here and then boom he's going right over there to them alright he just quoted that I'll turn it to the Benzema group that's coming up now turn my hands to the little ones smite the Shepherd Israel first Israel smote the shepherd Israel smoke Christ smoke the Shepherd back 2,000 years ago scattered the Sheep to all the world remember the promise was is you're going to be scattered dispersed all over the world and then what's going to happen you're going to come back we already read them but God said I will turn my hand back to get them little ones at the last day when when reconciliation for iniquity has been made Israel will be saved every one of them let's turn to Isaiah he says Isaiah 66 chapter and read just for a minute and see what God says about Israel being saved how long it will take to save Israel what's real quick as I in Isaiah 66 8 verse if you want to read it who has heard such a thing who has seen such a thing shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day for as soon as i'm travaileth she brought forth her children as soon as i saw that that was their Messiah she was born again in one day make reconciliation for sins to make reconciliation for iniquity you see what I mean this is what brother Dale is talking about you can be Saint justified and sanctified these people can be justified and sanctified for twelve hundred and fifty nine days but one day they're gonna be safe I'm just reading the Bible right but you got to go through the process same way with all of us you gotta go through a process as soon as I saw that her massage that that was her massage she was born again in one day make reconciliation for sin to make reconciliation for iniquity uncleanness no mind they did that what was evil that which was wrong reconciliation was made for their iniquity now let's go to 2nd Corinthians 5 verse 17 therefore if any man be in Christ is a new creature now they're going to be totally a new creature because they're over there right now listen they're over there right now and they still don't believe that Christ was a messiah but they're going to be turned just like you didn't you you tell you out what that wasn't Jesus and there wasn't it no he did become personal - you got the new birth he's not gonna become personally balem until they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost a man therefore if any man be in Christ is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things have become new and all things are of God who has reconciled us now what we're taking on the reconciliation for iniquity all right reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and has given to us the Ministry of reconciliation as I said before through a minister you got convicted our reading scripture listening to a tape listening to somebody on you didn't just sit there one day and go I'm lost no there had to be a conviction you cannot tell me you just were walked out of the wilderness and said I'm lost no there was a conviction somewhere that that God said I am separated from you I have been separated from you for a long time now I want to reconcile you back to fellowship because what's what he says to win that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation that word of reconciliation is going to go to the to witness through the two witnesses for the 144,000 and they're going to born again they're going to receive the new birth now they're not going to be bribed they've lost that position do you understand that but they will have the same Holy Ghost you get or there's two different Holy Ghost let's read zechariah 12 914 it's that all about the atonement of the new birth so there's your three processes they go through three processes just like you do you know why cause brother Brown said future home ready the other day I heard it the other day going up the road he said since the boy I taught those three processes you know what them three processes if it's good enough for seven churches it's good enough for 144,000 because God don't change his word amen Zechariah 12 verse 9 this is last one that will musicians come after this they shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Israel because watch we're coming up to the time where he's gonna break that covenant then there's gonna be a battle of Armageddon right here we're gonna talk about that this afternoon alright then prove it by the Bible that after the 1260 days the two witnesses 144,000 they going to rapture there's nothing left but destruction okay that's why that there can't be only three-and-a-half years left because you can't you're not finished with the six fold purpose the sixth fold purpose has to happen inside 70 weeks and annual that's according to the Bible all right and I will pour upon the house of David upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for me what as one mourning for his own son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his first board in that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem not all over the world 144,000 in that day there'll be a great mourning in Jerusalem as the mourning of how to remain in the valley of megiddo what where's the Battle of Armageddon you went to both the Megiddo is a valley right there outside of Jerusalem all right and the land shall mourn the people and the land and the land shall mourn every family apart in the family of the house of David apart and their wives apart in the family of the house of Nathan apart and their wives apart and the family of the house of Levi apart and their wife depart family shamaya apart of their wives apart all the families that remain every family apart in their wives apart what they're gonna do they're gonna mourn they realized they killed them aside 2,000 years ago and God's gonna say they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and that's what's gonna happen is when that hundred and forty four thousand is saved God's gonna take them in a rapture and then there will be no one left on this earth that has the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will be gone off of this earth they'll sure they'll be a there'll be a foolish virgin but they didn't receive the Holy Ghost there'll be a cup of water of my name there'll be all these different people that has to stay on the earth brother Brown says has to go through the tribulation to be purified but if you got your baptism the Holy Ghost you can't stay here Jew or Gentile Jew or Gentile so now what we've done is now we're going to regroup we're going to regroup tonight this afternoon we're going to review some of this show where the Battle of Armageddon is and then see the other half of that 70th week because one week equals what seven years not three and a half years all right let's stand to our feet musicians come you love the Lord we're a word born bride so we can't be born or nothing else we got to be born by the word and if that words anointed and you receive it then kind of helps you be annoying but that's part of this that's three of the six little purpose you know what that does that gets the people redeemed but we got to get Al and redeem member it's to Jerusalem I mean Daniels our people and the city well the city can't be redeemed until after the Battle of Armageddon because if you redeem it before and then you have a balla Armageddon you destroyed what you just built but a little because the Millennial temple is going to be built got to be built after the Battle of Armageddon and when he cuts us when the Antichrist cuts them off in the midst of the week which is 2 1260 days then he's going to step into the tabernacle or the the Holy of Holies and he said I'm God and they're gonna go no you're not boom boom boom then everybody's gonna start destroying each other but you know what we're gonna be in glory we're not gonna be here what I said before if they if you never get a revelation of anything of this message you get one revelation if you're born again you will not have to go through the tribulation period you will not have to stand before the white throne judgment so thank God for that amen let's think it's on page 1 [Music] Gloria [Music] I shall look on if beauty in the morning when I reach that city on the hill oh that's it on Mount Zion go uphill
