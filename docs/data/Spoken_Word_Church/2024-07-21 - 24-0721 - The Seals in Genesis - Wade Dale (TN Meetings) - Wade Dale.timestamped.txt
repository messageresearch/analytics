[54:39] what understand right we can see them we can read them brother R preached them in 1963 amen
[54:46] amen 1963 this is 2024 I believe sometime we shut the book back I thought we were open book people
[54:56] right sometimes I look around and I think man they're shutting the book more than they're
[54:59] opening it but the true bride remember if you looked at Israel one day and you looked at them
[55:05] and you thought man they are a awful bunch of people if that's God's people I don't know they
[55:12] were looking at the mix multitude they were not looking at the true bride the true bride is moving
[55:17] on the true bride is not Wy Wy Woo is brother corny always says she's moving forward right she's
[55:24] ready to get out of here she wants to word of God more than anything in the world Amen so I love you

[56:27] we appreciate you we love you turn to the Book of James and what we're going to do do today is we're
[56:32] going to look at a progression this message is a progressive message that's right it is a message
[56:38] that moves forward God never stands still amen that's why you see the folks in Israel at the
[56:44] Wailing Wall that's why they're moving like this because God is a moving God Amen they're moving
[56:50] because they know that the word of God is alive and that it's moving but praise God we ought to

[57:44] not me but see you father and what you've done what you did at Calvary you saved us Lord from
[57:49] a from a wretched life of sin and took us and put us in Heavenly places as Paul said and then

[58:27] in Jesus name amen James 1:3 let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot
[58:36] be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn of his
[58:45] own lust and enticed own lust right God doesn't make you lust no God didn't make you sin no right
[58:55] but he made it situation when you did praise God for that amen verse 15 then when lust hath
[59:02] conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it's finished bringeth forth death amen the Lord has
[59:11] blessing to the read the word hold up hold your Bible up there for just a second then if you want

[59:51] sin and sin when it's finished brings forth death amen amen those are those four things now remember
[1:00:00] all of us sitting in this building was brought forth by that first one sure come on somebody we
[1:00:06] were cut we were born in sin shed in iniquity lust of our parents brought us here right but look but
[1:00:12] when it conceived it brought forth sin it brought forth you and me Sinners needing salvation but we
[1:00:20] come this way because God allowed us to come this way to get us back to the way and we have been
[1:00:26] there had not been a fall everybody with me that one more time we're coming now by spiritual birth
[1:00:34] where we were not supposed to come by SE birth we're heading back to that direction to where
[1:00:40] my father passed away 3 weeks ago and thank you all for your prayers and your and your comments
[1:00:45] and things that you that you told us this weekend just pray for us all pray for Mom where's mom can
[1:00:51] on here okay just pray for her she's having a hard time okay she lost her mate um for a long time but
[1:00:59] but just remembering but but I told him I said I said look I said my dad liveed 84 years some of
[1:01:05] you that age and older you're heading toward youth yeah you're heading toward what you're
[1:01:12] supposed to be had that not been a fall my dad is not standing in a body today that was produced by
[1:01:19] Sam and Peggy Dale I mean Sam and Hannah amen that was the shell that we put in the ground
[1:01:26] and that was the culmination of the death that's brought forth as death in the natural but praise
[1:01:33] God 50 or 60 years ago my dad gave his heart to the Lord and he became a new birth it was
[1:01:39] a new birth started something new that's why I called a new birth cuz your old birth was wrong
[1:01:44] that's why he told Nicodemus he said Nicodemus you must be born again he said do I have to go
[1:01:49] back see he right back to that lust part to the sinful part have I got to go back
[1:01:53] and you know if I was standing there and I know Jesus told him that was not just a conversation
[1:01:57] that lasted for two uh for two little sentences he said Nicodemus come on that's what killing
[1:02:05] that's what's killing you sure is that first verse but you must be born from above but we
[1:02:09] know Nicodemus didn't understand him but we do today we know that there's there's a way to get
[1:02:15] to God all right and it's through a four-step process in the end time we have as the Bride
[1:02:23] of Jesus Christ we have got to live this word make it alive bring it off the page stop the
[1:02:34] quoting with no meaning behind it I didn't say stop the quote I said stop the quote
[1:02:42] with no meaning behind Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood how many of you done that
[1:02:47] today that's what Jesus told us to do amen a quote from the Bible Y and Jesus is not wrong
[1:02:56] no he's never made a mistake no but he said eat my flesh and drink my blood now what are we doing we
[1:03:01] get the Divine interpretation of that he knew that we would in the end time get the Divine
[1:03:06] interpretation that we needed to be justified that we needed to be Sanctified that we needed to be
[1:03:11] filled with the Holy Ghost and that the word would come back into Power again or The Headstone or the
[1:03:17] Capstone whatever you want to call it we are that Apex of people we're not the bottom we're we're
[1:03:25] going through the church ages at home Martin Luther had justification justification chopped
[1:03:31] off your past sin but it was his new birth for the time cuz that's all he knew but for me and
[1:03:37] you just to be justified today that's all right you need to start somewhere cuz remember when
[1:03:43] lust is conceived it brings forth sin when sin's finished when you come to the end of your life and
[1:03:48] you're a sinner you're finished you have a white thr judgment and then you're gone right right
[1:03:55] to scare you but I hope you get scared y yeah I hope God gives you intelligence to realize if
[1:04:05] you're lost there is a hell there is a judgment and the Bible says if you'll be judged by your
[1:04:12] work I do not want to ever be judged by my words no as the Bride of Jesus Christ today
[1:04:17] we are judged by God's work we are judged by what Jesus Christ did and I stand in him the Bible says
[1:04:24] we stand complet complete in him brother tell us that complete in him and that's why we're looking
[1:04:30] at these four as brother tells us many times to say reading the quote he said that four death
[1:04:36] Messengers ate in other words ate the word down but four life Messengers is going to bring it back
[1:04:41] up and was it going to be through what killed us was a Doctrine yeah yeah Doctrine is what
[1:04:48] kills you or sustains you one of the two we are Doctrine people brother R said a church without
[1:04:57] a Doctrine is not a church right so you have a Doctrine here we have a Doctrine at our church
[1:05:03] there's a doctrine that tells us that we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we are heading to the body
[1:05:10] change right amen yes y'all need to nod a little louder so I can hear you when lust is conceived
[1:05:20] it bring forth sin when sin's finished now look we're all born Sinners sure yes okay we were born
[1:05:26] in lust we were conceived in sin that's right but we don't have to stay that way there's a way out
[1:05:33] because it says When sin is finished right when it comes to the end of his journey when you come
[1:05:37] to the end of your journey and they pull the plug in other words you're done right but God gave us
[1:05:46] four life Messengers to bring it back he gave us four comat Beast the lion the O the man and the
[1:05:51] eagle he gave us the Holy Ghost amen can discern the good from the bad the false from the TR right
[1:06:01] amen but are we looking at really a new verse or are we looking at just something that sounds good
[1:06:08] yeah right I run into people on this message over the years that just is in the message because it's
[1:06:14] something different Lord have mercy amen something different and then you see them that fall away
[1:06:20] they have no timeos right Jesus Christ is this message right amen all right amen it come through
[1:06:28] a prophet amen but it took a five-fold Ministry to break it down to the people that's why brother
[1:06:35] R's been gone all these years and we're still here amen am weakness in our pit I say I what brother R
[1:06:47] tell us in marriage and divorce he said the reason we're in this shape is because y'all can't read
[1:06:53] right it's because you can't go don't go to church the right church what' he say misinterpreted
[1:07:00] Doctrine or theology from the pull pet somebody told them it was okay to do what they were doing
[1:07:08] amen well I'm here to tell you it's not okay what we're doing there is a standard we must meet amen
[1:07:18] but when lust is conceived brings forth sin when sin's finished brings death let's read Daniel 12:4
[1:07:26] now we know one thing for sure that the Book of Daniel is the Book of Revelations to the Jews is
[1:07:32] everybody with me right the Book of Daniel is is is the Book of Revelations to the Jews cuz
[1:07:39] it tells them where they going it tells them that they have 70 weeks don't run out of the building
[1:07:43] we're not going to talk on 7 week of Daniel today which in his church it probably wouldn't matter
[1:07:49] be all right but you can say d in 70 weeks and people go almost like marriage and divorce they
[1:07:54] go running out the door yeah but there's a there's a designed time for the Jews amen amen time times
[1:08:02] and dividing of time three and A2 years they're going to get a Ministry of 1260 days everybody
[1:08:08] with me you and I don't there's only going to be 144,000 saved right that's why God said that's
[1:08:16] why brother said watch them that's the time piece right it's time we have no time Mighty Angel the
[1:08:23] time is no more we we're not in that but we do read the book of Daniel as the Book of Revelation
[1:08:29] to the Jews but remember by heart you and I are Jewish right amen by heart you and I are Jewish
[1:08:35] am so we don't just we don't discount all that throw it away no I I love to look at the feast
[1:08:42] days and all those different things that types what we're doing now in the end so Daniel 12:4
[1:08:48] says Daniel shut up the words seal the book until the time of the end we're not in the end time
[1:09:01] brother Jackie we're in trouble we're deceived we're rolling toward the end real quick sure
[1:09:09] remember the Bible says the days will be short yep but you better get me AR fooling around quit
[1:09:18] practicing put practicing going to church on some don't do that anymore but many shall run to and
[1:09:27] fro and knowledge shall be increased even with the book sealed up hello come on go back again
[1:09:34] right oh Daniel shut up the words seal the book until the time of the end and many shall run to
[1:09:41] and fro and knowledge shall be increased now it's not the knowledge of what's in that book because
[1:09:46] they can't see what's in the book right brother mik right it's hid it's hid from them it's sealed
[1:09:52] up sir but remember and we know all the symbols and we know what brother Rand did we know that
[1:09:57] the mighty Angel comes down with the book open we know that I hope you do but we're an open book
[1:10:03] people but remember what happened and we'll get started here real quick but what happened to that
[1:10:09] book in Revelations 10 89 John took the open book that's right everybody with me John took that open
[1:10:22] book and he ate it amen that's right it was open he ate it but what did he do it closed it back
[1:10:36] up oh wait a minute I got scripture gri not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed sealed
[1:10:47] until the day of your Redemption amen so it's all sealed back up in a bride nobody's going to
[1:10:52] be able to understand it but we as a Time as an end time bride it was open we got those seals but
[1:11:00] once they come inside remember you go into that Holy of holy it's not crowded no it's you and
[1:11:05] God you're sealed in Satan sealed out some some people are sealed with the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:14] Ghost and that's good but we want more amen the CES for more because when he ate that open book
[1:11:20] he can see things right sir remember brother R saw his name right yeah okay maybe you see
[1:11:27] your name start seeing your name in the book you said well my name's not the book m is is Samuel
[1:11:34] you got to see you got to see what brother Orman Neville is not the book but what happens during
[1:11:39] Orman Neville time on Earth is in the book right so you identify listen we identify with all that
[1:11:45] that's in the book that's happening in the end time now all out there and in here but let's
[1:11:50] turn to Genesis 4 and when we look at the seal everybody wants to to make it such a mystery and
[1:11:58] it is because it was closed and now it's open and it's closed back up in us and the world what did
[1:12:04] Jesus say the world will see me now who's the seal Jesus Christ is the seal all come on but what did
[1:12:18] he say he said in the end time I'm going to come back but the world's not going to see me anymore
[1:12:24] he said but you'll see me cuz I'll be with you even what in you to the end of the world Amen
[1:12:33] that's why we carry God With Us everywhere we go sure if you would think that brother uh Mike
[1:12:38] hus did a a funeral for brother Barry edin last Monday and we were able to go down and be with
[1:12:43] him and brother Mike at the end of the service he said you know he said we're all it was you know
[1:12:49] people there he said everybody here he said Close Your Eyes Of course everybody closed their eyes
[1:12:56] he said now you're alone with God think about that just by closing your eyes you can close the world
[1:13:05] out right and be alone with God that's shut in with God in a secret place all you can be in a
[1:13:13] crowd close your eyes amen you're shut in with God let God speak to you so Genesis 4 we talk about
[1:13:21] the seals let's go to Genesis 4:1 and we're going to TI a little bit here with the seals we know one
[1:13:27] thing for sure when when the when the lamb stood on Revelations chap 6 and when he opened the seal
[1:13:37] now remember who was the lamb Jesus Jesus Christ amen and he had a Doctrine remember brother Brown
[1:13:48] said Jesus's first Doctrine was what you must be born again so he is the doctrine of Truth
[1:13:55] so he was standing there brother said here stands a lamb tonight with a book in his hand and there
[1:14:00] goes the White Horse rid everybody with me right so when you read Revelation 6 it says one of the
[1:14:07] Beast said come and see and then what happened when he got up there he looked and something went
[1:14:12] away why did that thing go away why did that horse ride off with that impostor on it cuz he couldn't
[1:14:21] stand where Christ was right Christ come on the scene the lion of the tribe of Judah there was a
[1:14:27] Doctrine there that Satan couldn't stand listen you're being killed today by Doctrine or you're
[1:14:34] being made alive one of the two right and and a Doctrine has to come from somebody's mouth it has
[1:14:40] to be told by somebody somebody has to start a doctr and somebody has to Quail a Doctrine or or
[1:14:48] shut one down like we've had many doctrines in the message that that we've all fought against and and
[1:14:53] they just were false remember one thing anything that doesn't come from God is fault that's right
[1:14:59] it's pretty simple there's only two powers and Satan is permitted yeah all right there's only
[1:15:06] one all powerful but he permitted Satan to do these things but you'll read in in Revelation
[1:15:11] where power was given right power was given for Satan to what do the things that he did amen
[1:15:18] but so here comes the line of the tribe of Judah and he says John come and see and when he walks
[1:15:22] up John looks and he sees W horse rider right off what was that that was a Doctrine or the releasing
[1:15:30] of a Ministry or the releasing of a message right right cuz we're going to look here in a minute
[1:15:38] Cain's anger really didn't come from Abel be mad at AB it came from his doctrine that he took upon
[1:15:51] himself and Abel's was different yeah that by with you so now let's look at the seals as the loosing
[1:15:59] of a Ministry the the loosing of a true Ministry and the loosing of a false Ministry we know that
[1:16:06] the true Ministry had to be released first come on the true Ministry had to be released first Satan
[1:16:13] is an impersonator he's an impostor he's not an originator right no God is the originator and then
[1:16:19] Satan perverts what God brings so God brought a message the lion spoke something wrode off because
[1:16:28] it couldn't stand it it was a new doctrine that was going out right everybody with so what did he
[1:16:35] do he went forth conquering and to conquer let's read Genesis 4:1 let's put this in perspective
[1:16:43] here just for a few minutes and Adam knew knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bear can and
[1:16:52] said I've gotten a man from the Lord that's their Doctrine hello that was her doctrine that was not
[1:17:00] Adam's Doctrine right that was Eve do thereby with so there was a Ministry loose right there Satan
[1:17:11] got into that program come on right everybody with me sure right she again bued his brother Abel and
[1:17:20] Abel was The Keeper of the sheep but Cain was what till of the ground right I like why brother
[1:17:27] Joy said one time he said if can't would have just listen to God God didn't curse Adam and Eve
[1:17:34] God cursed the ground ground so Kain was trying to bring something out of the ground that was already
[1:17:38] cursed right yeah Abel by Revelation knew that that was what it was and took a lamp but we'll
[1:17:45] get to that in just a second she buried brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain
[1:17:49] was a tiller of the ground now look at verse three and in the process of time 61 years or so since
[1:18:00] the prophet left a process of time Cain and Abel grew up now I'll promise you there listen they
[1:18:10] were only four people on the Earth at the time so the conversation was not to a bunch of people it
[1:18:16] was to each other our mama or dad everybody with me all right the only couple of people and he was
[1:18:23] there with his brother and remember Cain was of the wicked one so Cain had a different Spirit but
[1:18:29] remember Cain before we get any further Cain had a chance to be right amen if not God is Not Just
[1:18:40] Right God is a just God Amen because if he doesn't give one person chance that one person can stand
[1:18:47] at the white thr judgment and said you didn't treat me like you did them right and he be Tre
[1:18:53] but being a just God he said now Abel you're doing right but now Cain if you'll do like your brothers
[1:18:59] that's what he hated he didn't want that same Doctrine yeah that's why Doctrine what separates
[1:19:05] us is as as Christian doctrine Doctrine separates us I hope we get over where I don't like brother W
[1:19:13] till he shout so much well we got a lot of people don't can't hear very well and you need to stay
[1:19:18] awake right and I can't hear very well either so I have to shout so I can hear my own talk
[1:19:26] I talk loud for those that don't and can't so in the process of time if you don't like that that's
[1:19:32] okay you're going to hear it for a little while but remember we have our little quirks but in in
[1:19:37] Doctrine we should be solid and be the same amen there's only one way one truth one life but we see
[1:19:47] here in the garden the first thing Satan does is divide but he divides them not because k en able
[1:19:55] they I'm sure they they hey they grew up together right they grew up together they would they wasn't
[1:20:01] like I said they wasn't a thousand people and they went off into a different place and now Cain
[1:20:04] did later on but they were together and they Tau watch and then the process of time that came to
[1:20:13] pass that came brought her the fruit of the ground an offering to the Lord and watch what happened
[1:20:21] something Grew From that mhm everybody with me right it didn't just nothing come up so that Kane
[1:20:31] would know he was wrong right no God had already set forth he said let every seed bring forth of
[1:20:37] his kind everybody with me if it's watered if it's put in good ground it will come up amen so
[1:20:46] in the process of time came starts formulating his Doctrine oh yeah I'm okay I can grow this
[1:20:54] stuff but look look it it must be anointed of God it's coming forth It's Growing I'm getting apples
[1:21:02] and oranges and peaches and all these different things it must be of God sound like his mama must
[1:21:08] be of God but he started formulating his Doctrine in other words his Doctrine was cultivated no pun
[1:21:16] intended yeah cultivated in his heart so he he he then started moving himself away from Abel
[1:21:24] right cuz remember it's two opposing forces right and that's it but who came now what and
[1:21:32] Abel verse four he also brought up the first Ling of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord
[1:21:37] had respect into to Abel and to his offering but Cain into his offering he had not respect Cain
[1:21:44] was very raw his countenance fell yeah you cross somebody on the doct right brother Andre where
[1:21:50] you at that's right brother amen and countenance fell and the Lord sent her to Cain now listen this
[1:21:57] didn't come from any other source it came from God himself God talked to Kain and said why AR
[1:22:03] thou wrong and why is thy countenance Fallen if thou doest well amen shalt thou not be accepted
[1:22:12] in other words he's presenting to him the correct Doctrine through what Abel did yeah now remember
[1:22:19] when lust is conceived remember don't get away from that when lust is conceived bring forth
[1:22:23] sin sin's finished bring forth death all right everybody with me keep that on your on in the
[1:22:28] back of your mind if thou doest well shall thou not be accepted if thou do is not well sin lies
[1:22:35] at your door right he was pretty plain about that you don't do what I say you're a sinner sure yeah
[1:22:43] wow and to thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him so he was given the right Doctrine
[1:22:52] but in his own lust he wouldn't take it cuz he thought he was right yeah right so now if we
[1:23:02] look at the seal we see the first seal was what it was a white horse with a rider now remember that
[1:23:14] white horse was not righteous it looked rightous right yeah amen by I'm going to take my time here
[1:23:23] for just a minute get this established you go to the first seal a white horse went riding off and
[1:23:30] even the prophet for a time right people hate this he was deceived right he thought that was a mighty
[1:23:38] conqueror he thought that was something to do with God because it was white I'm just telling you what
[1:23:42] he said he said he'd made a horrible mistake if he if he made conqueror again everybody
[1:23:47] with me but progressive revelation allows us to step up yes sir it allowed him to step up
[1:23:54] when that seal opened see that's why that seal had to open that's why all the seals had to open
[1:23:59] so brotherr could bring the true unoperated word of God perfect sure yes he made mistakes but his
[1:24:07] message is perfect amen right that white horse rider rides off brother said that look like a
[1:24:13] white righteous church but it wasn't it was Satan yes riding on his Pilot it looked like right right
[1:24:23] so what happened here when we see the conversation between GL and Kain we see a development of a
[1:24:32] Doctrine and K gets on that horse yeah right I'm just as good as able you mean you're not going to
[1:24:43] accept my sacrifice brother Ram even said he come to the point where he said said K said here God
[1:24:49] take it or leave it right now he's talking right straight to the man ain't going through a filter
[1:24:55] he's talking right straight to God right he he would not accept correction right he would not
[1:25:02] accept come on the right Doctrine so he formulated his own and he still seemed righteous he still got
[1:25:09] that white righteousness in him that's what Rose up righteous indignation rose up and came now
[1:25:17] watch but now remember when Satan rode that white horse when he got off that white horse the next
[1:25:24] horse he got on to was what it was a red horse and power was given a sword was given to kill
[1:25:35] with me you don't know the seals just read the seal book so this red horse he was given a sword
[1:25:43] so Satan was given power to speak true that's right yep that's right power is given and a
[1:25:54] was given now remember it wasn't sword sword is a word what is the word word a Doctrine so he
[1:26:02] was given this Doctrine cuz watch look at verse eight and Cain talked with Abel his brother now
[1:26:12] they weren't talking about the weather no they weren't talking about what's going on in another
[1:26:17] country there wasn't one it was pretty obvious Cain and Abel were talking about the differ
[1:26:25] between their doctr right right everybody with me can't talked with Abel his brother and it came to
[1:26:36] pass right so it formulated over a period of time the righteous inly nation grew up in Canan Abel
[1:26:44] was just a humble little sheep hurder you know so it didn't bother him right like a Christian
[1:26:49] if you're a real true Christian somebody can just rant ra and blow and snot and spew everything else
[1:26:55] it don't bother you shouldn't that's right you know where you standing so Kan talked with Abel
[1:27:03] his brother now watch that red horse ride because when they were in the field they got away from M
[1:27:10] and died they got out in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him
[1:27:16] right killed him physically killed him got on his red horse yes and started wri he still thinks he's
[1:27:26] right every brother R said Satan still thinks he's right he's not no listen he's the biggest deceiver
[1:27:32] in the world but he's the biggest deceived person in the world Amen he thinks he can whip God the
[1:27:39] very one that created it you see how I think did one time you can't trick or tricker and you can't
[1:27:48] you can't Bluff Satan cuz he's the biggest Bluff there is you can't Bluff Satan don't even try
[1:27:55] but Cain talked with Abel his brother and they came to F they
[1:27:57] were in the field and Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew it
[1:28:01] red when lust is conceived Satan's lust in Cain brought a conception what brought him and death
[1:28:16] together or him and the sword together killed able everybody with me today it's boring you you need
[1:28:22] to hold it up and the Lord said unto Kain where is able thy brother now the Lord comes on the
[1:28:28] scene he's not worried about he's he's want he's want what he's want to do he on came to do what
[1:28:33] testify oh yes God knew able was going to die he knew right where the bodies at amen he wanted Cain
[1:28:43] to testify that's why there'll be a white Throne judgment you're going to have to testify why you
[1:28:49] turn God down everybody with me there will be why on judgment but praise God I told the church
[1:28:57] not long ago I said there's two things if you don't get anything about this message get these
[1:29:04] two things I'm talking about the whole message of the Alum yes two things number one if you're born
[1:29:10] again and your bride you will never go through the tribulation right praise God for that amen number
[1:29:19] two you will never have to stand before the white thrown judgment that to me now that's not enough
[1:29:26] but to me that's enough to bring me to a place to where I want to try my best to miss those two
[1:29:33] things get born again you automatically miss them amen free ticket to glory amen but you got to get
[1:29:40] born again F sure right and listen folks just like there was a conception between Cain and Satan to
[1:29:48] bring forth that what that red horse rider to kill with there's also a conception for me and you amen
[1:29:57] yes amen absolutely you got to be conceived in the womb here and then here right right we not get to
[1:30:05] that bless him Lord he said what hast thou done oh wait a minut Cain says I know not he lied to God

[1:30:49] Doctrine right or he would have accepted it the voice of thy brother's blood crith unto me from

[1:35:06] black and the last one is what great it's a culmination of all these others right
[1:35:17] lust is conceived it brings forth sin when sin's finished it brings forth a pay hor
[1:35:23] yeah it brings forth a doctrine that you and I today are deceived by unless you're born again
[1:35:30] right amen amen amen that's right so let's go to verse 11 real quick now watch what did God
[1:35:40] say now look he he gave Abel a chance and gave Kane a chance he even said come on man

[1:36:04] first he gave him a chance he said now are thou cursed anybody with me right we went through the
[1:36:15] white we went through the red now we're in the black the Blackness of Cain M yeah listen to
[1:36:26] this and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's
[1:36:35] blood from thy hand when thou kst the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her
[1:36:41] strength now remember they were in the garden of Ed they were in the garden of God they were in
[1:36:52] the garden that God placed in the East right God planted a garden that's what the Bible you read
[1:37:01] that yes amen okay Cain was in that Garden that's how close it is came was in that very Garden of
[1:37:12] Eden and when he was planting potatoes there wasn't any Thorns there wasn't any thisle it all
[1:37:23] grew just Kim you didn't have to get down and pull the weeds up cuz remember God's getting ready to
[1:37:30] curse the ground later on right hello amen what am I telling you Cain is sitting here today in this
[1:37:39] church don't look over preach it bro don't make them mad they'll get mad enough to get
[1:37:49] born again brother said there were three types of Believers and they
[1:37:54] I'm just tell you what he said True Believers make Believers and unbelievers right it praise the Lord
[1:38:00] I'm telling you I I just speak plain I'm sorry we need the new birth amen we need to know the
[1:38:10] Plan of Salvation we need to know that the plan of God is for us and it's an updated Revelation
[1:38:17] amen amen Luther's justification will only get you justifi in this period of time it will not
[1:38:26] give you the new birth but it did give it to Luther because that's all it was required to
[1:38:30] do listen more is given more is required we are given the open book we are eating the open book
[1:38:36] we' eat the open book now remember what happened when he eat that book what happened to John it
[1:38:42] said John now you just go over there and set in the corner and you shut your mouth and don't say
[1:38:45] nothing he said prophesy Amen to every
[1:38:54] Kingdom tongue and Nation go talk about this book amen that's open yes sir that's why
[1:39:03] we're preaching today amen that's right you don't believe in a fivefold Ministry you just can't grow
[1:39:10] I'm sorry you might get born again under an egg under a um under a dog yeah you know what brother
[1:39:17] I'm say yeah right but you will not grow you can't press press play can't say it you can't press play
[1:39:25] and get the full meaning of what this message is that's got to come through a fivefold Ministry
[1:39:32] to perfect the Saints amen I just bring us here to sit and have a happy time we're good we're good no
[1:39:42] the baby's really beautiful babies are beautiful the Bible says they're born dead but the babies
[1:39:48] are beautiful but take that baby and put it in that room and shut the door go back there about 3
[1:39:54] months MH you'll find a dead baby that's right of course yeah but what do you do with that baby you
[1:39:59] feed it you feed it that's right you feed it and you keep feeding it like you some of your teenage
[1:40:05] boys you never get enough amen that's right knows that with his two that's our heart that's the way
[1:40:14] we should be in the gospel just for a minute to kind of break everything we should be that way
[1:40:17] in the gospel that's right we should be hungry for the word of God just like Adam and Levi was hungry
[1:40:23] to go eat this meal we're fixing to eat over the part car they're already looking at the menu
[1:40:28] I I hope I hope we look at this menu today amen see that we're giv we give we're giv a
[1:40:37] seven course meal amen so let's continue just for a second everybody all right amen so we're
[1:40:43] walking through the the we're we're we know that the the two most wonderful books in the Bible
[1:40:49] brother R said was what Genesis and Revelation right one tells the beginning one tells the end
[1:40:54] anybody with me yeah so you ought to be able if the seals are open in the Book of Revelation we
[1:40:59] ought to be able that to know that they open in the Book of Genesis hello they're opening right
[1:41:05] now that's right in this in this whole scenario God is opening a Doctrine or a Ministry and so
[1:41:12] is Satan sure cuz remember Cain's Doctrine it's false and it's continuing to this day right here
[1:41:20] amen but so is AEL cuz remember Abel passed but Seth was born right right that's right when thou
[1:41:31] tell us the ground it shall not hence forth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond
[1:41:36] sht thou be on the earth and Cain said unto the Lord W he Wy W My Punishment is greater than I can
[1:41:46] bear behold thou Hast driven me out this day from the face of the Earth and from thy face shall I
[1:41:53] be hid and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that
[1:41:58] everyone that findeth me shall slay me praise God I hope we we're devil Slayers amen we're
[1:42:05] demon Slayers we're can Slayers I hope we are sure yes now let's look watch this right here
[1:42:18] now remember when lust is conceived brings forth sin When sin is finished it brings forth death
[1:42:23] okay so we're look we're getting ready to look at the finish of the scenario R the pale horse
[1:42:31] rider now what is the pale horse rider it's all three colors wound into one yes the culmination
[1:42:38] of the red the white the red and the black swirl together and put in a Pale Horse right putrid
[1:42:46] color that's the way it is now so now watch and the Lord said unto him verse 15 we're not
[1:42:51] going to be long bless Lord the Lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth Cain Vengeance
[1:42:57] shall be taken on him Sevenfold now watch and the Lord set a mark yeah upon gain yes lest any find
[1:43:07] him should kill and what brother R said that was that was the mark of the beast mark of the beast
[1:43:16] right but he hasn't made his fatal mistake yet can't had made speci mistake yet right the mark
[1:43:27] of the beast and sealed of God 1961 brother said now we find out that the first marking of a human
[1:43:33] being started in Genesis Genesis 4:15 God Mark K that's where the first mark of the beast was
[1:43:41] ever put on was put on Cain he is the beginning of it let's continue on paragraph 25 a mark is
[1:43:50] a distinction it makes a difference now remember when lust is conceived bring forth sin When sin
[1:43:55] finished bring forth death yes right uhhuh are the Apex or the culmination so what's it going
[1:44:03] to culminate in it's going to culminate in a pole starting in a beast right going
[1:44:08] to end in the Beast every I with me on that starting as the Beast it's going to end as a
[1:44:13] beast absolutely now we find out look a mark is a distinction paragraph 25 of that same same um
[1:44:23] a mark is a distinction it makes a difference y it separates something amen but like you say
[1:44:31] you got one Mark against you a mark but you never said you had one seal against you you
[1:44:39] got one Mark against you and a seal is a sign of ownership yes amen With Me Seal is a sign that's
[1:44:49] why the Bible says you're sealed until the day of your Redemption am amen amen but these seals have
[1:44:55] to open to us to get us to a place to where we can be sealed up yes listen to me just a second
[1:45:04] you got one Mark against you a seal is a sign of ownership a mark is a distinction and the church
[1:45:11] is sealed by the Holy Spirit showing ownership hallelujah amen God owns this church amen but
[1:45:19] the mark of the beast is the Wayward the outcast that refus to take and come God's provided way
[1:45:27] amen Cain as soon as he was marked went away yeah we got that Abel died and set raised up to
[1:45:36] take his place with a sign of Resurrection so where was Cain's fatal mistake verse
[1:45:43] 16 cuz
[1:45:47] remember God was okay God kept telling him he kept guiding him talking to him talking to him
[1:45:55] talking to him right right God never said leave my pres that's right that's right told him all these
[1:46:04] other things what to do how to turn around right he refused it but his fatal mistake and came went
[1:46:12] out yes from the presence of the Lord that was it you ever leave the presence of the Lord you
[1:46:18] are Mar that's right that's right and dwelt in the land of n on the east of E brother around in
[1:46:23] Ephesian Church age 19 well so the church age Ser if you don't believe in the church age book you're
[1:46:30] lost anyway did you get it now there are those twins again now we talk talk about twins there are
[1:46:35] those two trees again growing side by side in the same earth right partaking of the same nourishment
[1:46:43] yes now listen let's go back just a second can't produce fruit right he eat beans and potatoes and
[1:46:49] carrots and all that stuff now listen abble didn't set up for Hill and just chew on the Lamb's leg
[1:46:56] no we like a little beans with our meat don't we yes in the natural what I'm telling you is is he
[1:47:07] ate they both did they both partook of the same nourishment what brother R talking about they both
[1:47:12] partook of the same nourishment drink the same rain water and benefited by the same Sun yes but
[1:47:21] they come from different seeds that's right one tree is for the word of God exactly as God give
[1:47:27] it and loves it and obeys it Hallelujah the other tree is from a seed that's anti- word anti- God
[1:47:35] and changes it whenever he wants to right wow it substitutes its own Creed and Dogma for the
[1:47:43] living true word exactly as did Kain who ended up killing Abel but fear not little flock stay with
[1:47:49] the word keep that word between you and the devil Eve did not do that that's where she fa right amen
[1:47:56] and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness of Satan
[1:48:02] that's right let me read that one more time and when the church lets down on the word she
[1:48:08] goes into the depth of the darkness of Satan power transformation 1965 brother R said look 150 years
[1:48:16] ago only travel of man was done was by horse or foot now he goes by jet almost by thought
[1:48:22] well a right see science has done it and that's of the devil now you say that's right brother yes
[1:48:28] sir let's take Genesis now verse four we been reading and Cain went out from the presence of
[1:48:34] the Lord he read that from the Bible now here is his quote for that paragraph 145 now watch the
[1:48:40] first thing he done you tell me when you think you got enough here cuz I'll just stop he said
[1:48:47] that what I'm saying it too see he came without from the presence of the Lord there he made
[1:48:53] his mistake right and there is where you will make a mistake and there's where I'll make a
[1:48:59] mistake the very minute we walk out of the presence of the Lord Brother that's it cuz
[1:49:04] we walked out we made a choice that's it God wishes that nobody he didn't wish for Cain to
[1:49:10] be like he was right can't chose what he was you choose what you are y brother that's right
[1:49:18] now I promise you one thing you got to crawl over the cross to go to heaven that's right
[1:49:23] amen amen but now watch we're talking about doct in just for a minute and then we'll
[1:49:29] finish Cain goes to n right goes out from the presence of God he goes to n with me he
[1:49:39] marries his half sister everybody with me you say half sister yes because his
[1:49:45] sister would have been from Eve and Adam Cain was from the Beast and Eve really
[1:49:52] and Abel weren't Brothers they were half Brothers come they had different right so
[1:49:57] he took his half sister and he went to out from the presence of God and what happened
[1:50:03] then he starts having they start having kids and look what his Doctrine produced verse 19
[1:50:10] if you still got the scripture there lit was one of his sons yes and lit took unto him two
[1:50:18] wi his doctr polygamy right right which was listen was permitted by God but that wasn't
[1:50:29] God's perfect will no cuz look at what the perfect will is now one man one woman that's what it was
[1:50:34] supposed to be in the garden right so what did he do his Doctrine culminated and even went into
[1:50:40] his children cuz what he was telling them hey it's okay hey it's all right wear what you want
[1:50:46] to that's okay come on now God loves you go ahead brother listen I promise you come as you are right
[1:51:01] shorts bob hair whatever come as you are sit under the fountain you sit under this Fountain long
[1:51:08] enough and you'll either leave or you'll get born again and you will not leave the place the same
[1:51:13] way you came listen as Christians today we're not going to leave that place right that door right
[1:51:19] there without changing some way that's right amen is what brother said do we believe God sent us a
[1:51:25] prophet well I'm in a good group right he said you either are better or worse when you walk out
[1:51:33] that door that's right you're worse because you took that doctrine of cane and said that ain't
[1:51:38] for me right that ain't something I want to do but you got the able group that says whatever
[1:51:44] Lord I slay a lamb for you Lord slay me put me on the altar amen get rid of the old made yes
[1:51:55] that's what we need we need to kill it what I tell them when we go baptizing we baptize 20 something
[1:52:00] people last year or so I said we're going to a killing that's right we're going to a death
[1:52:05] yes right but praise God Sister Kim we bury him but we raise them back up amen but we are going
[1:52:11] to it you're going to die one way or the other right right that's it don't I watch just for a
[1:52:18] second we go through the sea we see 1 through 4 we were just talking about is that right all right
[1:52:28] just for a second not 12:00 yet I hope that's right right go ahead bro going be L than an hour
[1:52:34] huh well everybody's hungry all they far they done looking up where farmer's daughter is you know why
[1:52:41] cuz I did was in there good we're just Home Folks that's right we're just home F and I love you
[1:52:53] appreciate you bless them Lord so let's look at this real quick just for a minute so if seal 1 23
[1:53:00] is four is tight in can and abble I just did it right when lust is conceiv bring forth Sin Sin p
[1:53:09] and bring forth death the death that Cain was is not the physical dying of Cain it was him walking
[1:53:15] out of the presence of the war that's right you w out from the presence of the Lord You're Dead
[1:53:19] that's right cuz remember in the presence of God is life right amen and the presence of God is life
[1:53:26] away from the presence of God is death right that was K fatal mistake now listen brother Rob could
[1:53:32] have said I just read you the quote he could have said Kane's fatal mistake was was telling God a
[1:53:37] lie no I know y'all never lied to God before come on people pray for me sometimes I tell people h i
[1:53:46] tell tell them stuff like that they're like well maybe I'm the only one I'm preaching to me Dorthy
[1:53:52] so I maybe I can help myself right Bless but we've all denied God we've all lied to God sure listen
[1:53:59] if you lie to your Godly parent you're lying to God Bingo oh hello somebody boy that BR it
[1:54:06] that brought it down to the house you lie to your parents kids and they're Holy Ghost filed You Lie
[1:54:12] To God so so what I'm saying is that happened to Cain but God didn't say you're done for no it was
[1:54:21] when Cain made the choice to leave the presence of God absolutely brother Choice can't made
[1:54:28] the choice to go in another Direction he didn't want to do he didn't even want to stay where God
[1:54:34] was I was that way when I come here when I was what 10 11 12 well 13 14 years old 15 years old
[1:54:45] I just warm PE I want to go do something El while you get quiet now but it's the truth but when God
[1:54:57] struck my soul 20 something years ago it drove me to church it drove me to read the Bible yes
[1:55:07] brother it didn't drive me away from God it didn't drive me out of the Garden of Eden it drove me
[1:55:12] back into the Garden of Eden that's right brother what did Brother R tell us he said the three-fold
[1:55:17] mystery of God was all God was was he poured into who Christ Christ according to what the church
[1:55:25] take her back to the Garden of Eden yes amen amen all God was you born in Christ all Christ born
[1:55:33] church church then take her back into the garden of Ed by what by the same Doctrine amen that Abel
[1:55:43] had it was blood right his blood still cries out every group of Believers yes so see 1 2 3 and 4
[1:55:52] we can type those as justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost and the word remember brother
[1:55:58] R said four death Messengers e remember the the whatever it was wor I can't remember read it he
[1:56:07] said I will restore promise I'm going to give you back those years that that bug eat down
[1:56:12] but that was four Life Death Messengers eat it down four life Messengers brought it back amen
[1:56:17] which was what Luther Wesley Pentecost and here the bride anybody with me amen all right so now
[1:56:25] we come to a full restoration and remember after the fourth seal the Rapture takes place right am
[1:56:32] I with Meen read it because brother Rand gets on a fifth Feld he says I don't see any more combat
[1:56:39] Beast no and the combat Beast is the Holy Ghost the line man an eagle he said I don't see that
[1:56:45] anymore he said so it must be that the bride has left the Earth yes amen what a revelation amen
[1:56:52] so what happened when we come to that four seiling when Cain walked out of the presence of the Lord
[1:56:57] what happened next Seth came forth there was a resurrection that's right that was a resurrection
[1:57:04] and Seth began to call on the name of the Lord that's what you and I when we have a resurrection
[1:57:09] from our deadness amen that's it amen Doctrine it produces life there's a resurrection something
[1:57:18] happen I don't care if it's two fingers sticking up praise God for something amen that's right amen
[1:57:26] amen now watch that was the four four seal 1 2 3 4 happened right there in the Book of Genesis
[1:57:39] real quick let's look at what brother rown said about justification sanctification and baptis the
[1:57:46] Holy Ghost brother said God Justified the world by what the flood yes amen amen washed it with
[1:58:00] the water now remember sanctification brother R said God came himself in human flesh called
[1:58:08] Jesus Christ and his blood that's the sanctifying power to the church is the blood that's why the
[1:58:14] blood C yes amen so sanctification was Jesus's blood at Calvary to cleanse and claim the Earth
[1:58:24] absolutely and then brother R said the seventh seal was the Holy Ghost himself yes coming on
[1:58:30] the scene What Not Jesus yeah we know they're the same person come on yes but he's in a different
[1:58:39] manifestation now amen right he said he said in John 17 he said father I pray that they be one as
[1:58:50] you and I are one now was he in God too no we were talking about this when we got here Thursday yes
[1:58:57] sir a lot of people in the message they they they they blast the Oneness they blast the trinitarians
[1:59:05] which they the biggest Tess ever was that's true brother true Jesus is out there and and
[1:59:12] I got a piece of him right here no sir St John 17 he said father I pray that they be one amen

[1:59:53] right that's right to be the anointed cherub to do all the
[1:59:58] singing to do all the praising amen that's right amen Dr you that for a
[2:00:05] minute cuz remember that if you want to be like God so does Satan that's right there's
[2:00:14] one thing Satan can't do he can't be God that's right you can amen you can amen cuz
[2:00:22] he said that amen he said brother L but God he preached a sermon not too long ago but God
[2:00:29] right who is rich in Mercy but God Who does these things God said We Are One hallelujah
[2:00:35] amen truly we know that we're not the fullness of the godhead body and individual all right
[2:00:43] I'm not exuse but now brother rown did tell us and I didn't bring the quote but I got it
[2:00:47] lay back in in the office brother R said the Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time
[2:00:52] would be the fullest of the godhead b and a collective group of people amen bringing
[2:00:58] everything together we are Jesus Christ on the Earth the only God they'll ever see until God
[2:01:03] comes back in flesh in the Millennium that's right so whose flesh is he using
[2:01:09] right let me give you a little Point real quick you have a soul you have a spirit you have a body
[2:01:21] every person in here does yes all right right now your soul is permitted by God when you're a
[2:01:29] baby born on the Earth God's the only one who can give a soul yeah that's right Satan cannot create
[2:01:35] Satan cannot give you a soul God has to permit a part of him come on come on right not Eternal but
[2:01:45] perfect amen with me amen that's why all babies go to heaven that's why brother R was real clear
[2:01:52] until the Agee of accountability what the blood of Jesus Christ covers you but then there's an
[2:01:57] account that begins when you start knowing right from wrong there's an account that's
[2:02:02] being recorded of the things you do and if they stay on that book you're doomed that's right amen
[2:02:12] that's right right they stay on that book you're Doom right but when you're truly Justified come
[2:02:22] when you're truly as the flood killed everybody on earth except the people that were in the ark
[2:02:29] right so you going to have to be dead also amen that's right your soul that nature that's attached
[2:02:38] to that soul and your Soul's not going to die cuz you're you are a soul right that's right
[2:02:43] I don't believe in that two Soul doctr where God gives you one Satan gives you one one gets pulled
[2:02:47] out one gets killed that's too complicated for me amen I just believe that I came here with a
[2:02:52] sinful nature it was attached to my soul if I keep that I become that yep but one day in 198
[2:03:02] 1997 I said God I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired I don't want to do this no more amen
[2:03:09] iin finished with that old me and right then he justified me you know what that book became like
[2:03:15] this it had bad stuff written on it bad stuff recording Angels don't miss anything that's
[2:03:26] right you Mom and Daddy M recording Angels do not but one day when I was truly Justified brother
[2:03:32] Mike that was my account amen that's right but I remember the one that made me do it is
[2:03:42] still there yes so there's an account started again a recording of my Deeds that's right but
[2:03:52] if I come to sanctification God cleanse me I wanted to go to church I wanted to read my
[2:04:00] Bible I wanted to do the things of God what was that doing that was driving that unclean Spirit
[2:04:05] out right hello what book Luke says that's right now they some of them went willingly I tell them
[2:04:14] the other day some of them went like this yeah but they got driven out yes and then and I got
[2:04:22] sealed by the Holy Ghost thank you Lord right so that sealed Christ in sealed Satan now right but
[2:04:31] we still got a spirit realm where the greatest battle ever fought is right there right amen you
[2:04:37] said all my flesh my listen folk your flesh ain't nothing but keep your guts in your body that's
[2:04:43] right that's it uhhuh it keeps you encapsulated it keeps you from falling apart this doesn't sin no
[2:04:52] no no it's born in sin but this is not sin no what happens inside is
[2:04:58] sin amen you want to prove that to you Jesus stood one day and the Pharisees
[2:05:02] said never touched a woman in my life oh never never committ adultery never touched a woman
[2:05:10] in my life never Jesus looked at and said wrong if you've looked on one that's right but what it
[2:05:20] wasn't this he went deep than this sure he said if you look on a woman to lust after you've already
[2:05:26] committed adul with her in your heart amen amen that's pretty simple so don't listen quit blaming
[2:05:33] your flesh for a lot of things you do your flesh is getting old I know that for a fact but don't
[2:05:39] blame my flesh for doing anything it's that me that's inside that does it right this just
[2:05:44] reacts to what's inside it's connected still the justification by the flood Sanic if by Jesus's
[2:05:52] blood the Holy Ghost himself comes and lives in the person listen to this real quick 1963
[2:06:00] brother R said look souls in prison now said those of you that listening on tape I wish you
[2:06:05] could look at the congregation at this time I hope you're feeling the same way I hope some of
[2:06:09] you feeling the same way if you're lost today you need the Lord am cuz you're in a can camp
[2:06:16] right what if it is look at the scripture piled in here could it be is the third pole to preach
[2:06:22] to the Eternal Doom that's rejected the message of Salvation well you said the church is going yeah
[2:06:31] they will they'll go right on just the same y amen but remember all this time Noah was in his ark the
[2:06:39] bride is sealed in with Christ Hallelujah the last member has been redeemed the six seal has produced
[2:06:47] itself the seventh seal brings him back to Earth yes amen the lamb come and took the book out of

[2:07:05] yes we're standing here today right looking at that right there what is the Sixth Seal what is
[2:07:13] the fifth seal the fifth seal you talking about justification the fifth seal real quick brother
[2:07:18] Andre already knows this amen watch the fif de it's the soul under the altar crying how
[2:07:25] long how long to avenge our blood not bride amen that is a group of people that just claimed theel
[2:07:36] to be the people of God waiting for the Messiah Jews that are killed they don't even love Jesus
[2:07:43] that's right know did you come on did you no you didn't no of course not you love the world and
[2:07:52] things of world right that's right amen but one day he justified you Hallelujah if he justified
[2:07:59] a group of people that hated him come on that's right remember they were given white robes right
[2:08:08] they were given eternal life MH God Justified them sure did and if he could do that to them in
[2:08:17] that condition why can't he do it to us in this condition amen that we can realize that our old
[2:08:24] man's gone that everything we've done in the past oh yeah San's going to bring it up amen but praise
[2:08:32] God God created a sea yeah right that nobody can touch Satan cannot go into that sea no sir right
[2:08:44] everybody with me you know what that se is it's the seed of God's forgetful right we can remember
[2:08:52] it Satan can remember it but God has planted a place to where he can throw your sin come on
[2:08:59] somebody he throw your sins in that sea and put a no fishing sign on it you bring it up that's your
[2:09:07] fault that's right we got to start realizing who we are why we're here that we're Justified and
[2:09:12] those he's Justified he's already glorified he's already give us a new body we just got to walk our
[2:09:18] way into it we got to eat our way into it thank you Lord everybody with me in sanctification and
[2:09:27] come on we got to keep being Washed by the Water we got to continue on listen don't stop amen don't
[2:09:35] stop don't even slow down it's a pull it's a pull it's pulling us somewhere if you're attached to
[2:09:47] God yes you somewhere look at sanctification when we look at the six seal what is the six seal the
[2:09:54] six seal is a total Destruction of this world right brother called it the tribulation period
[2:10:02] yes don't you have one well pray for me here we go again pray for me cuz I have them right but
[2:10:10] the tribulation period does what it sanctifies the Earth that's right so that God can come back
[2:10:16] and live on it it will sanctify your Earth if you'll let it do the same thing as brother Joel
[2:10:23] was talking last night not a firecracker yeah firecrackers no good TNT is no good uh big 50
[2:10:36] caliber bomb's not even good brother Brown said the atomic bomb of faith is the only thing that
[2:10:44] can obliterate and destroy the enemy that's I want to leave you with that that will destroy and then
[2:10:52] what happens then this Earth come on this Earth and this one yes will be so cleansed that God can
[2:11:02] come in dwell in us the way he wanted to am but he'll also be able to put his feet on the ground
[2:11:10] that six seal sanctification of the bombs and everything going off and wiping everything off
[2:11:14] of the earth then God puts his feet down yes he takes back possession amen take back possession
[2:11:23] Satan had you at one time but God said they're mine they're my people now they're my bride that's
[2:11:30] right they're the ones that I love and you know what we love anybody let's stand up for you right
[2:11:36] we love him back we thank God for what he did for us yes Lord we thank God he sent us the word of
[2:11:43] God so that we can look at the seals not just in the Book of Revelations but you can type it

[2:12:23] love of the Lord thank you for for listening maybe that'll help us to realize that the the seals we
[2:12:29] know are open but they're closed up inside of you and only you and God can talk about that right
[2:12:34] you and God are the only two alone in inside of you oh sure the Satan does Satan does get
[2:12:39] into your brand once in a while but remember the old story that brother R told about the

[2:16:24] not that other side and I pray as our brother made it so eloquent and so clear I pray that the
[2:16:31] word of God that's drawing us that's transforming us that's making us into His Image I trust that
[2:16:37] when that word comes by that we don't put our own intellect or our own idea and say well I'm
[2:16:44] just as good or I don't need that we don't want to do that right Jesus said if anyone take away add
[2:16:51] to the word then the plagues of this book shall be added I'm thankful for the justification and
[2:17:00] sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost under MDC amen as the Apostle Paul said in second
[2:17:08] Corinthians we desire to be clothed from our house that is from Heaven as our precious brother
[2:17:15] preaching that word and showing us the wisdom the discernment of the son Sons and Daughters
[2:17:21] of God knowing their position and knowing the hour that we're in oh thank you so much brother brother
[2:17:29] Wade we thank brother the Lord for using Brother Wade in such a way if there is scripture today
[2:17:36] you would have to deny the scriptures he read from the scriptures laid them there in Genesis and the
[2:17:44] two books that sat I'm not going to preach the two books that sat from Genesis and revelation
[2:17:51] he showed us that showed us the scripture showed us the progression of Satan sin and death and lust
[2:18:01] y I'm thankful that we are not in that progression right but in the progression of the word as Jesus
[2:18:10] the Bible says he grew in Grace and knowledge and Peter says in second Peter 3:18 grow in the grace
[2:18:18] and knowledge that the eyes of your understand understanding Paul says might be open and the
[2:18:24] spirit of wisdom and spirit of Revelation that we might know the hope of his calling and who we are
[2:18:30] and God's inheritance in the Saints thankful there's a people here that know who they are
[2:18:38] know they come from God I know that these things that we're seeing today these modern events made
[2:18:44] clear by prophecy Israel in their in their land not just in their land but crying out because
[2:18:51] God has permitted these things when we see the Hamas and the hoopies and hot there and Ira Iran
[2:18:59] and Rush all these things we can't just look at God's time piece and think there's not something
[2:19:05] there some climax come life is more than eating three meals a day and putting on some clothes
[2:19:14] Jesus said I come that they may have life amen the Abundant Life Satan comes to kill Ste and destroy
[2:19:21] so on what brother Wade said if you look in the mirror of God's word are you continuing to walk
[2:19:28] in that word is there a real pull in your heart to say I want more of God we don't have no church
[2:19:34] program this is the program of God it's not some man program trying to lift up some man so somebody
[2:19:41] say well that you know it's the word that's being Jesus said why be lifted up draw to me
[2:19:49] thankful we are so you got to look in your own life don't matter what church you go to these
[2:19:55] churches we got plenty of here in earth when you like to take something back with you take
[2:19:58] them many people that's as far as they go that's right buddy brother

[2:23:05] you when we look at each one of you as brother Brian says God is a god of variety what who does
[2:23:14] want to live with this God there there has to come a time though when when the preached word
[2:23:22] becomes the lived word becomes becomes flesh and begin that's you and so we're so thankful to God
[2:23:31] for you all coming up I saw my father in The Gospel or dad in The Gospel what you want to

[2:23:58] the grace and knowing who we are and seeing the word made manifest I'm not looking at a man I'm
[2:24:05] looking at the reveal word for this hour God knows for M it is the reveal word and so when I see you
[2:24:14] all and I've been knowing you all you've been knowing me over the years and we see each other
[2:24:20] to encourage one another we want to encourage our young people let them know that they are blessed
[2:24:27] and this age that Satan is trying to destroy the identification of our young people and old people
[2:24:33] and whoever is trying to tell us that we're not who we are he's trying to put his identification
[2:24:38] on you and and all this all this wicked perversion in this Le AG I'm thankful that we know who we are
[2:24:46] and where we come from I'm thankful that we don't have to be some siss weak pits that afraid to tell
[2:24:52] the truth or some me money women in popularity I'm thankful that there's genuine ministers like
[2:24:58] brother way men that don't just try to pick up a text and preach but men that are dedicated I
[2:25:05] was telling brother black I really appreciate him brother Aon there brother Lis there these men have
[2:25:11] been a blessing to this congregation a blessing I was listening other night y y'all permit me to say

[2:25:58] say well my child is not uh obeying me or they hardheaded so they still each child love claim
