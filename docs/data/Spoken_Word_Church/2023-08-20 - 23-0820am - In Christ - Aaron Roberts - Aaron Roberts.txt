Conyers last night and they had to that some of you knew about the message Believers Youth Choir did anybody know brother Michael did it's supposed to be on YouTube if you get a chance y'all to listen to it we were brother Daniel Gibson danders Church hosted it this year and they were in Conyers at a different Church and my brother Jack Duff was the one that was the I guess to be the MC of the the service and brother Isaiah Brooks and Believers from Trinidad and man I tell you what we had a good time last night and as brother dick always had always quoted me if that didn't stir your soul your spoon fell out of your bowl we had a good time last night and I tell you what we you know God inhabits the Praises of his people and we had a wonderful time last night and uh I just got thinking about they sang that song last night your goodness is running after me and I just it's hard to contain it and uh I was just I was just overflowing you know we wonder why things happen the way they do in life but you know today is the is the third third anniversary of my dad going home my dad's graduation and I thank the Lord for for my dad and who he was and one of the things I want to look at maybe this morning but he uh he made me and who I was you know I didn't have to uh I didn't have to grow into anything I just look like him I act like him people say I sound like him well you know I didn't I didn't have to manufacture any of that I didn't take one class to practice that I never stood in the mirror because you know what it's not an impersonation it's a manifestation and if I can do the same thing with my heavenly father if the life he said if the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you you'll do the same things he said when I come and take up our the father and I take it by our boat in you then you do the same things and so it's a wonderful thing this morning to know who we are who our father is and what God has done for us hey man if you have your Bibles we're going to look into II Corinthians chapter five and verse 14. and also uh today is Janine's birthday I don't know if they told you over then anybody mention and I'm not going to tell you how old she is she'll tell you but I appreciate the Lord you know Janine talked about many times about moving back you know moving down here and and you know what the Lord works out when you have the desire but you don't see the plan how God will work things out you just put your trust in the Lord he knows how to work things out he knows where you need to be at the only thing we have to do is just follow the leading of the Lord and people always ask me do I uh that ever have to take care of my sister growing up that I ever have to look out for I don't know when I was in high school had people tell me said Aaron we'd rather fight you because you know when to stop so I didn't have I didn't have to take care of her I might have had to pull her off of somebody when I have to I end up pulling nobody off of her but I appreciate the Lord and his mercy and his grace his goodness has followed us surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever we will so he knows where we need to be at and what we have need of I'm so thankful he's mindful of us hey man let's just read the scripture here second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 14 says For the Love of Christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that day which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh see Christ is not known after the flesh yea though we have known Christ after the flesh see Paul didn't know Jesus in the flesh but he had a carnal understanding of who Christ was and many people only see Christ by a carnal understanding he said yet now his forth know we him no more and so when he said all that then he says therefore see we don't say therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature because old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to him by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation so now we have been reconciled to God but what is the second part of that we have been given the word of reconciliation do you know that if the world's going to see Jesus Christ they're going to see Jesus Christ in you the word of reconciliation has been given to you so we are the ones to show the world Jesus Christ for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him amen God bless you this morning you can have your seats and I'm I entitled this message in Christ because he said if we be in Christ then we are a new creature a new creation in Christ and old things have passed away and behold all things have become new and I want to look at uh to this morning I want to look at a few things about the the Apostle Paul and his and his ministry and I was I'd been reading this little uh excerpt and uh I thought was real interesting how they they were talking about Paul's Ministry and and you know everybody has their questions of and uh some of this will relate to the message but you know they they take the things that they look at and they talk about Paul's Ministry and and they begin to look at the things that Paul wrote about well you know the one thing that Paul wrote about in in the scripture when he was writing the scripture and we know that it was all come from God because God given the word Paul didn't write his own message Paul Paul wasn't Paul was just the Scribe because the Holy Spirit was the one that come to Paul to write what he had but what Paul was writing about Paul was writing about his experiences he had an experience and that's what he wrote about he knew what he was writing about something that took place in his life and I you know many times people ask about why did Paul not write about this or Paul didn't write about that why because that was not Paul's Revelation that was not Paul's experience Paul's writing about his experience and Paul writes the same experience that he had as the rest of the church because one of the things that uh we'll get into is you know Peter and James and John the disciples those they had they actually slept with Jesus they ate with Jesus they walked with Jesus all of those things that they had a personal experience with the flesh Jesus the man that walked on the shores of Galilee they knew that man but Paul never knew that man Paul never had an understanding like Peter did but he said see he began to talk about the experiences that he had the understanding that he was given and this is from the message that God had explained brother random speaking here and he's speaking he says and Paul he goes here to King Agrippa and Festus and he said I was once of you I was the Pharisee of Pharisees he said it come up under Camellia the great teacher and he knew and note all their rules and regulations and just what they believed and what they did not believe and said even I persecuted the Church of God unto death he said so he said the very thing that I'm in question about I was a persecutor of and he said and he talks about this death of Stephen you know that's laid such heaviness on Paul all of his life because what had taken place and brother Brown goes on he said well you know you can kill a messenger but you can never kill his message it's if it's real and the message though Stephen was gone on to stand with Jesus yet his message lingered on Kyle's Pig Paul kept talking about it and what he's leased to them and he wasn't worthy to be called one because he had witnessed and gave his consent to rid this godly man this Godly person so when he began to talk about the things that he had seen but he never could get rid of that because it was it was a part therefore Paul like all men before men should do Paul takes his experience back from the beginning to what he was and then places it and bases it upon the scripture to show that what he was doing was scriptural though it was contrary to their belief and yet he was showing them that it was the scripture and so that is what we are to do is to take it back to the scripture now when Paul begins to talk about the things that he had been through you know Peter could explain different things that had his experience and things that he had been through and all the the different things about walking with Jesus and everything but you know Paul had the experience that the New Testament Church had and see that's the reason Paul writes about see if we understand the grace of God the love of God has been expressed to us has been shout abroad to us then when we are to receive this word then we don't follow Christ after the flesh we don't try to follow what Jesus done after the flesh because we follow him after the spirit because if we see what has taken place then we have become through the Life of Christ that has been shed that if we've received that then when we receive that then you know we become a new creature a new creation in Christ Jesus that we're not following him after the flesh because you know the flesh will never never amount to anything he said the letter killeth but the spirit is what gives life and we can take the life that Jesus lived because it's no longer him living and trying to follow like they did in the Old Testament trying to live the law and try to express all this thing from a from an understanding from an intellectual standpoint but it takes the life liked inside when the when the life takes it comes on the inside when it becomes expressed from the inside then you know what you don't have to worry about it because it will Express itself because it's when it's on the inside and it becomes a manifestation you know because then all of a sudden see when when Peter and Paul and the disciples when they live their life you know they looked at what Jesus was doing they didn't understand all those things but you know what there came a day when they did understand those things there was a day that they understood why because the one that done those things was on the inside and it began to manifest those things and they began to understand why because all of a sudden then they began to do the same things that Jesus done and this is from the message the absolute and he's talking about we all need to have talk about Daniel and everyone's everybody has needs absolute he said Paul had one too we are reading about it he had a christ-centered call and that was his absolute that's the reason he wasn't afraid of what agripple would say standing there in Agrippa was a Jew as you know and so then when he was standing before the Kings and things God had already told him that he would be there so he had an absolute so he told exactly the heavenly vision he said I was not disobedient to it or dishonorable to it did not misjudge it I didn't misbehave myself but he had to and was not disobeded he carried it out to the minute for it was an absolute in any christ-centered life that's your absolute now he says now since meeting him face to face on the road to Damascus that was meant so much that was so meant so much to Paul now remember he was a scholar beforehand he was a mighty man in the scriptures but he didn't have any tie posts but the Sanhedrin that would back him up and had a diploma from a great teacher he was a great man in his field but he was waiting only thing he had his absolute would have only been as strong as as organization was that's all the stronger he could be and he was working faithful to that and was talking taking Christians and binding them and making Havoc of them and even Stone Stephen and I think later in his life the reasons he went to Jerusalem when he was the prophet he told him don't go up there Paul for chains in prison waits for you but Paul said I know it but I'm not going to Jerusalem but I'm not going to Jerusalem as a witness I'm going there I'm ready to die for Jesus Christ for he knew what he had done and his ambition was to seal his testimony with his own blood die of martyr because he killed one of God's martyrs and he said any look and he continues on and see what he talks about going on the road to Damascus and and seeing those things and he says and he looked up when he had the when the light struck him down on the road to Damascus he looked up and he saw that light shining that blinded his eyes and what a strange thing it was no one else saw the light just saw it was so promised so real to him until it blinded his eyes he couldn't see totally blind with that pillar fire blazing him right in the face and he knew of he heard a voice saying salsa why persecute us thou me he said Lord who are you he said I am Jesus and it's hard for you to kick against these Pricks right now and go to Damascus and there will be one sent to you then when he raised up from there there was one a prophet down in the city who saw the vision while he was praying came ananias came and come into Saul laid his hands upon him and he was healed by the Divine Healing he rose then and was baptized washing away his sins calling upon the name of the Lord and then he had an absolute he was never the same after that he went straight from church to church and placed a place trying to build up that which he had tried to tear down and so we see how you understand Paul's life and you know one of the things that they talk about was you know Paul was not the one even though he was this great alerted man and he understood the Old Testament they all understand all these things yeah you never find Paul writing about Jesus in a manger you never understood saying understanding how I'm talking about Isaiah and the different prophecies that Jesus would fulfill you never underst you never hear him talking about all those things you never even though he was a Jew you never hear Paul talking about the lineage of Joseph and Mary you never even talk about any of those things but the one thing he talks about was that Christ was a propitiation for our sins that he was the fullness that he was the fullness of the godhead bodily that he was the image of the Invincible God so when he came he was the one that was to fulfill why was he to fulfilled not the Old Testament scriptures and and all the Old Testament but he was to be what what he was to the bride what he was to the message of the the people of that day are the people of that age was that he was their sacrifice he was the one that was to bridge the gap between God and man he was the Fulfillment of that to bring them into the fellowship of Jesus Christ that's who that Paul began to talk about why because it was not because Paul had all those years of learning and understood the Old Testament and understood all those great things but you know what when the Holy Ghost came and struck him down on the road to Damascus when he took the word they had to spend three years reading the Old Testament again because then he began to see Christ all those years and understood all those things but it but in that one moment when he was struck down then something changed in his life and it took him three years to get to the place that he needed to be see it takes why because he took him back to the word and all of a sudden the word began to open his brother Bob was talking about this morning to see when you get into work it begins open you start to walk forward and keep going forward and it becomes open to you you begin to dig into the word and it becomes real to you brother Branham says that you know why why do we have so much struggle why do we have so much problems why because we don't give people to a new birth all right well because you know what if you had a life-changing experience and you know what somebody ought to see the life that's changed [Applause] you got to think here's a here's a Pharisee of the Pharisees here's a man that had real zeal but because you know he had sold out his entire life to the word of the day well because he thought he was doing exactly what God had called him to do to persecute the church well we got to get rid of all these religious zealots they're not following the law they're making a mockery of it and you know what and you know I hate it well you know what they just they just believed they were the way they want to and I'm going to believe the way I want to that wasn't Paul's idea y'all were Jews circumcised y'all know the law you know some hags off the backside of the desert somewhere so y'all y'all grew up in this message in the message y'all y'all know what the law is y'all come in in the temple all every single week y'all know the law you have kept all of the feast days y'all done all that kind of stuff and now you're out here making this well you bunch of crazy people out here running around talking about some guy that raised from the dead and all these kind of things all doing all this other stuff you know what Paul's like we got to get rid of this are really good we're not letting it we're not letting this stuff go already like Barney Fife said we got nipping in the bud we gotta get rid of this hey you know I had real zeal because you know what when Stephen was stoned when see honestly I may be wrong I don't know but maybe it was Paul that was out there and he was the one that stirred those men up maybe it was Paul that was down there saying we got to get rid of these people Michael do you not see this and when they sing all this you know it's like well you know what they got all worked up and it's like we're gonna we're gonna do something about it so they went out there and got some stones especially when Steven got out there and said you're uncircumcised a stiff-necked in heart to believe all the scripture well when Stephen took them right back to the scripture he took them back to the Old Testament to show what Jesus had done that Jesus was the Fulfillment of the word one but because when he went contrary to what they believed then Paul we gotta get rid of this we gotta get rid of it but Paul didn't have to pick up a stone and throw it but you know what if his words if he was the one that stirred those men to go do that you know what he was just as guilty as if he had taken the stones and stoned Stephen itself but if he stood there holding the coats while they done it well I didn't get my hands dirty but you know what he was more guilty than they were but he was the one that went up there the thing all worked up about destroying that he had zeal he had a he had a real love for the word and you know what nobody could say what what gods could say in Saul nobody could see what he could see God saw I can use that man that man's got the qualities the characteristics the qualifications that I'm looking for I can use that man right there why because if you can get him the revelation of the word then you know what he had the same Zeal didn't change who he was his nature didn't change but you know he still went after the word and he began to go out and then you say all of the church people oh we believe we believe in a miracle work in God we sing Jesus we were here when Jesus walked the shores of Galilee we seen him raise the dead and heal the sick and and know the thoughts and intents of people's heart and all the things that he had done all the great things that he had done we believe in we believe in a miracle work in God the problem was people didn't believe that Saul could be the miracle Saul wasn't a miracle that they were looking for no Lord we don't want that man that man is crazy he's a he's a troublemaker as long as as long as as long as the day is he's a troublemaker we don't need that but this but the Holy Spirit Come and told her ananias ananias I got a job for you it's like Cheryl Lord are you sure you want me to do this is there not other people in the city that we can go to Lord you know what kind of person this man is he ain't got no good reputation but the Holy Spirit began to deal with ananias you go down there and find Saul and you pray for him see many times we get we get in our own mind how things ought to be or not be and then we we want to we want to judge who people are or who's going to make it who's not going to make it well thank god it's not up to us it's not up to us it's up to God who he chooses he's got a sovereign will and he's going to do how it however he wants to do it and the thing is is we've got to just yield to his will and his way and say Lord however it would be Lord let your will be done and here's here's Saul having having this great Zeal for the for the word and all of a sudden when when the Holy Spirit begins to deal with him and he goes through this and and ananias prays for him and then he gets baptized and the Holy Spirit becomes into him he receives the Holy Ghost well then you know what the first thing he does is he don't run around and jump and shout and all these kind of things well you know what I received the Holy Ghost I receive the Holy Ghost you know what Paul done it's pretty amazing sometimes because when you look at people it's sometimes it's the last thing people want to do but what do you do Paul goes out there and he gets he takes the scripture he takes all the Scrolls well if we if we believe like like they say you know they could stick a pin through a scroll in every letter that it would touch they would knew which what letter it was when he had when he had studied all that day and night he knew every word he knew every jot every title he knew everything about that law he had spent his entire life studying that he knew the ladder of it but one day he had to go on the back side of the desert for three years he said and all he done was go scroll back through the Scrolls back through what the prophet said said what David had said all through the Old Testament reading all of those all that writing all those letters all of those prophecies all those Visions everything that was written down he began to read through those things and all of a sudden you know what he saw it completely different all of a sudden he began to see things that he'd never seen before all of a sudden he began to see that Jesus Christ was laid right there in the Old Testament and everything that was written it began to speak of Christ he began to see Christ and he began to see every part of the Old Testament when he began to look at the Tabernacle in the temple all these things every part of they began to speak of Jesus Christ he began to sing and all those things why did why did Paul you know people don't say you know they don't give a lot of people won't give Paul credit for writing Hebrews but when he began to sit down and look at the things Paul was exactly the one that had to write the book of Hebrews why because he was the one that had the understanding of the Old Testament and no wonder what he had after went through all of that writing and all those readings and everything then he began to speak of the things all through the Old Testament showing the Hebrews the Jews that Jesus Christ was the Fulfillment of it see when he began to take those things he began to see who Jesus Christ was Hebrew came real to him to see who he was and then he began to express that he turned his back on all the rest of it why because he found a new way a living way a life-changing way and then he began to walk in that well no doubt when when Paul goes out and he begins to speak to the people and he begins to tell them about what he had done what he had seen in the scripture about the life changing we know some people probably wouldn't open their door people looking down the street amen don't want to be standing on the same street with him but you know what it took a while for people to begin to see the change in Paul is this an actor is this really something going on did he did he have a real change he just trying to get more of us is what he's trying to do trying to be skeptical about it but you know one one time he began to speak to those people no doubt and all of a sudden the presence of the Lord's there when he begins to speak then all of a sudden realize you know Paul's received what we've received there's been a change so you can't it takes the Holy Ghost to do these things brother Brandon was speaking here in the message Jehovah Jireh and he's and he's speaking of the Bible and he said see it's just like a jigsaw puzzle the Bible's just like he said if you if you excuse the expression he said if you just try to put it together just the way you look at it you've got to have something over here to look at if you don't you'll ruin your scene you'll have a cow peeking grass on top of a tree so it won't work won't be right he said so it's a way when you try to put the Bible together with an intellectual understanding of it you can't do it it's a spirit written word and it takes the Holy Spirit to place it together then when you get the whole great picture from Eden out into chaos and the way of the Cross back home there that's the entire picture God's Redemption story of sending his own son to redeem a loss and polluted people and then continuing on here and this is from the message serpent seat and brother random says he said why did Paul command after it been done Paul said if even if an angel from heaven come and preach anything else let him be accursed so when he had seen all this you can't have it put together by an intellectual understanding because that's what Paul had Paul had the word he had no Olive by intellect he knew it all a Pharisee of the Pharisees and see when Paul begins to speak to the other ones he said you can't lean on your understanding see that's what they had done because even when the when when uh Paul began to rebuke the New Testament Church why because they went into Grace and they want to go back to law they were trying to go why because they're trying to have this balance you need to stay away from that you walk in the grace of God don't go back to the law you've come out of that why because God because Jesus was the Fulfillment of the law that we come into Grace then you know what it's not us trying to fulfill the law by trying to do all the works it's us to live by righteousness by his righteousness in us the light that's in US lives the word hey man he said see if an angel from heaven come and preach anything else let him be a curse now you see we got a new we got new light on it no you haven't that's what the devil come to eat with some new life you don't need no new light you need to walk in the light that God's already put there that's all see we because we don't walk in the latest brother Luke Gibson was preaching the other the other night when he was here you know we got to stand and walk in the light that as the light has shined in front of us we need to walk in that light as he is in the light but see people are trying to find more like let's walk in the light that you've got I can't remember who it was but somebody was here and and they were talking about the uh people overseas somebody and they were talking about oh we're wanting to want more message books we want more message books and and somebody said well said why you want more message books you ain't reading the message books you got well if you not read the word that you've got now why do you even need more we just Stack Up message books like it like it's a status symbol I got a big got a big got my big cabinet here and I got all these well if you're not inside of you're not reading it then what good does it do you cut down all those trees to make all that paper for it to collect dust you know it because many times I've seen preachers that you know some of the brothers come from overseas and you know they only have half a dozen books sometimes they only got a third of the books that we've got in their own language and they know more about this message than other people do people been in there 40 years and you got somebody been here two and a half years and they preach circles around other people why is it why because there's somebody that's laying in the word that's feeding on the word and the word is being quick and to them not just waiting for something just just to have a status symbol who has been sold out to the word and who's just playing games have we sold out how we give our all to this have we given our all have we committed all to God I know I'm in there myself why because I I need I need that too Lord help me you know it's not just throwing it out there hey we're we're responsible for this too see we have to understand that God what God has called us to not just not just to have an idea of something but to know what to know what the truth is to understand the fullness of it you know brother Brandon speaking here and he says you know he says God doesn't send you to hell for being a sinner he said God sends you to hell because you won't repent and take Christ as your savior he said you refuse to take the right Road you send yourself to torment you send your own soul to its Eternal destination upon the free moral agency of your own convictions God does not send anyone to hell he never did and he never will men send themselves to hell because they refuse to accept the way of salvation God he's long-suffering he doesn't want any to perish never wanted it but men rather walk in darkness than walk in light the reason is they're born in that condition and they have no desire to take the light see the messenger he said but God is good and full of mercy and wouldn't want no one lost but man wants to be lost because it's his desire he refuses to walk in life that's what makes him be lost so you've got to walk in the light and so wherever people get stuck at it's not because God's fault is because their own fault because you know as because when when time happens and things happen in life and whatever we've got to get to the place where you know we get to the place where we get down with the business with God we got to get to the place where we figure out where we are with God and let God come and speak to us and if it takes all night if it takes all week if it takes all a month you need to get before God and stay right there until God gives you an answer what God tells you what needs to be done and how it needs to be done and when it needs to be done and if you'll let God work in your life he'll take care of these things but the problem is people still battle the same thing for 30 40 years whatever they keep going around the same mountain in the same problem as as they never get to the place where they get to an answer they never get to a time post that'll hold you there and you'll know where your answer is why because they never get into a place and stay there until they get Deliverance why because how many times has has brother Dale stood up here brother Wade has stood up here and the Holy Spirit be moving through the building and he keeps asking people well if you need something now's your time to come well people don't come well then whose fault is that just like just like brother Brown talking about the man dying on the doctor's doorstep he's standing right there and the doctor's there to help him but you know what he's gonna die on the doorstep because he's a because he gets to the place where he won't go see the doctor he's made it that far he's just going down the steps and won't go in it's the same way we can get to the same boat we get we battle the same things over and over and over and never get Deliverance see we've got to get to the place where we come through and overcome this is from the message the key to the door he says amen you believe under eternal life and Are Born Again by your faith Jesus said in Saint John 5 24 he that believeth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life not the Holy Ghost just has everlasting life he's born into the family of God and then baptized into the Holy Ghost with the power of the intelligence of Faith to believe the Holy Ghost is put to work and make it act right so you as as brother Dale or brother white was uh preaching on you know having when you when he takes away the Stony heart and he gives you a new spirit he takes out your spirit gives you a new spirit but then he gives you his spirit see there comes a time when he's got to be able to deal with you that he gives you a new spirit he gives you a spirit that he can begin to deal with you that you can live with your own self why because you know what we're so hard-headed and sometimes we're so carnal that God has to beat on to us sometimes to get our attention and it takes the grace of God and as we were speaking of last time about living walking in newness of the spirit why because when the Holy Spirit begins to deal with you because that is the work of the Holy Spirit justification is a work of the Holy Spirit Saint vacation is a work of the Holy Spirit and as you begin to walk along in that Journey see it's the Holy Ghost it's the goodness of God in your life showing that the Holy Ghost is working and you drawing you to that place and it's for us to walk in that newness but because we didn't walk in that before we walked into carnality of our own mind and the desires of the world but when the when the Holy Ghost comes and starts drawing us forward then you know what it takes for us it takes us to continue to walk in that so the Holy Ghost can begin to do the work in us and as he begins to do this work in us then it starts to drive out the unclean Spirit then the Holy Spirit can take up residence in US it takes the word but you know what you've got to continue to go in you've got to continue to go forward in this and if you will continue to walk in it then you'll see the work of God take place yeah he said no man can understand the word outside the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when when man says that he's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and disputes the word being right there's something wrong see Paul he said Paul was a Critic of the New Testament he wasn't the New Testament wasn't wrote Paul was a Christian was a Critic of Christianity Saul and when he received the Holy Ghost he went three went three years down in Asia and studied the scriptures because he was told unto me a great teacher then when he come back 14 years later he went up to meet Peter and Jerusalem and found out there they were word and by word the same gospel the same God that had that had Peter that had Peter preached on the day of Pentecost and tell them to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that same Holy Spirit revealed it to Paul and he told them again in Acts 19 after they had done been baptized One Time by John said you have to be baptized over again in the name of Jesus Christ see and then he says see the Holy Spirit stays right straight with the scriptures it's faith in that that unlocks every mystery amen the Bible said in first John 5 7 these three that bear record in heaven the father of the word which was the which was Christ and the Holy Ghost these three are one and there are three that bear record in earth water blood spirit these three are not one but they agree in one now you can't have the father without having the son you can't have the son without having the Holy Ghost they are one but you can be justified without being Sanctified and you can be Sanctified without having the Holy Ghost sanctification is the blood is by the blood through the blood comes life see and the Holy Ghost is the power of God see the power given to the church so when you begin to see see then you've got to take just like Paul did when he saw those things it took the Holy Ghost and it began to make it manifest and then he began to walk in that and it's the same thing see the holy spirit is going to stay right with the scriptures as brother Bob was speaking of this morning see when the Holy Spirit comes and you begin to walk in the word and you know then it begins to identify the things in your life but it takes every step of the way see we don't discount somebody that's in in the place of justification why because that's the work of the Holy Ghost and you know what I don't discount anybody that's walking in justification why because that's the work of the Holy Ghost and you know we're not supposed to speak against anything against the Holy Ghost see the only person that's ever going to put down the word because if that's the word and that's the word that they're walking in then they're doing exactly what God has for them to do that's where you're at that's your PL that's your position that's your place but you're the only person that's going to put that down is Satan is when you're when you're anointed of Satan see there's not well you know you're not where I'm at well anytime you ever get to the position where we get that kind of spirit we get that kind of attitude then you know I don't want that I don't want to be in your position but see but you know praise God that God has called people and he's called them to that but the problem is there's a further walk that you've got to come to you got to continue to walk wouldn't be an encouragement to people continue to walk he continue to feed don't give up don't stop now when you begin to see these things when you begin to see the the spirit of the Lord working well praise God just continue to walk and if you fall down if you fail you know what even people that have been born again for years you know they still got problems and they still have failures but you know what we don't we don't give up praise God we've got a we got to Advocate with the father he says continuing on here he said see we we you shall receive power acts 1 8 after this the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall receive power he said not you'll be born again you'll receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you then you'll be my Witnesses in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria unto the uttermost parts of the earth so you receive power after you receive the Holy Ghost But first you must receive the Holy Ghost and that is the power of God see to manifest and demonstrate your you as you was a human and learn to walk and talk and do the things as a human does when you're baptized with the way with the Holy Ghost you're given power to act as Sons and Daughters of God no wonder people act and do the way they do today they've never been filled with the Holy Ghost if they would they'd act different they would they claim they have but Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them so how can you do it and you see it's just all scrupled up see come back to the facts see by the fruits you'll know them it doesn't have you know because it's not by your uh testimony it's by the testimony that you live it's by the testimony that we live it's not what somewhat we just say it's because what takes place see many people they just see it as as something that takes place but it's the Holy Ghost Megan so see this is a message from uh modern events made clear by prophecy and he was speaking of Luther and and the the seed coming through he says and so will the so will the church come through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost restoration of gifts right on into the formed image of Christ is the bridegroom and the church is the bride and the Bride is a part of the bridegroom it'll have to be a word church not a denominational Church it'll be the word church the word that's made known and by the Vindicated word of God so when we say this that you know I put this in there because you know many times I every time that that I'll speak on this I I just want to uh show everybody that you know people nowadays have have tried to say that brother Brandon preached the uh the new birth a different way and you know he tried to change things and he had one way and and I tell him I said well this right here was uh from uh 12 6 1965. this is modern events at the end of his his ministry getting almost to the end of his ministry and he says the church will go through justification save vacation the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he says see Christ is the bridegroom and the church is the bride and she'll have to be a word church so if this is the word then you know what it will be the word all the way through from the beginning to the end it will always be the same so he never when just like when brother random said in the future home he said I've always told these stages of Grace I've always thought this same thing well it never all the way through the scripture it's the same thing and if you think he changed somewhere well I'm sorry that you've got the wrong Revelation you've got off the word because because God set things in order and it never changed he never deviated from that and so you always have to come that same way because if because if the natural birth types of spiritual birth he didn't change the natural birth it all comes the same way you still got to come that same way and it comes by the word and it comes all the way through and it's not some denominational idea not some other way but it's by the word it's going to come the same way it never changes and so I I wanted to put that in there because I want to show that because because it's it's got to be by the word but brother bad of all says says but it's by the Vindicated word let me tell you something president my word's not Vindicated other people but you know what brother branham's word is Vindicated because it come from God that's the reason I want to stand with the word I want to say because I'm standing with saying well he said because I know what I know what the prophet said I know what the scripture says and I'm standing in the in the Vindication of that why because I've had that same experience I'm walking in that myself I understand what he's talking about see that's what I'm standing in and it's not that I'm trying to change anything I want to know what he said brother Brandon told us that we're supposed to believe what he said why because he was the one he didn't have his own ideas he had he had the ideas the word came from the Holy Spirit from the Lord to give him the word to speak and when he spoke those things that God was the one that responsible for that not him so I'm not I'm not standing here having to be responsible for it I just tell you what he said and I'm responsible for believing it and I'm I'm responsible for acting on it and I'm responsible for walking in it that's my responsibility this is from the we know this we've read this many times but this is from birth pains he says you know we know the old seed it must before the new seed can come out of the old seed it must rot absolutely not die only but rot after it's dead we know that to be true say when that seed rots away that all of that's got to be gone you put the seed in the ground and it rots away you can dig out through the ground and trying to find it you won't find it it's gone because you know way down in the ground you know you can dig through all the dirt and you'll not find anything but you know what that life is still there that seed's still there you see all that has to be all the old man has to be going same thing in the new birth we never go back but we we go forward when you're born again he said that's why I think today we have so many not so many rather genuine New Birth is because the seed is maybe we'll sympathize with the word or the person but they don't want to rot away from the old system that were they were in they want to hold on to something they don't want to come out of it they want to stay in the old system and claim the new birth or the message of the hour a message of the h he said we find that under the Luther Wesley Pentecostals and all the other ages they still try to hold on to the old system and claim this but the old system age must die rot in order to bring forth the new one they still want to clink you know brother I'm speaking of you know he said if the lutherans had a fallen just just stayed in the same light if they'd just continue to walk in the light that was there and if they would have continued on then they would have become Wesley and say to come right into the method and say to continue with John Wesley's message why because it would have brought him right into that and he said if the Methodist had a continued on in the same word following in the same way because the light began to grow the light began to move it was more like and it was more like to walk in if they had continued on they'd walk right in and they'd talk about the Nazarene and the pilgrim Holiness and all the rest of them he said you cabbage down he said if you continued on he said you'd come right into the Pentecost he said you'd have walked into the light and you'd have walked right into the gifts but they failed to walk they began to they failed it because they were right where they were I know this I know but it's continued time to continue on and that's what he said the Pentecostals invaded continue to walk in the light because what was he there he was there to minister Delight to them to show them the white if they were to continue on they'd come right into this message to see the the end time to seeing what God was doing in this end time and it's the same white brothers and sisters we have to continue on today and walk in the same light don't stop continue to walk and this is from the five definite identifications of the true church and he was speaking he said if you will he said turn to Luke 24 49. and he says behold I send the promise of my father unto you but tear ye in the city of Jerusalem to you being dude with power from on high now he promised of a coming Church a coming Kingdom now turn right around to acts 1 8 now remember he spoke also in Matthew 16 18 up of Upon This Rock he would build his church and the gates of hell should not Prevail against it we're going to get to that in just a few minutes as we go on down into the other subject acts 1 8 he said but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and into the utmost parts of the world a kingdom a coming Kingdom of witnesses witnesses of his resurrection Witnesses of his power Witnesses of him being alive you're my Witnesses now acts 1 8. so when he begins to talk about this see then when he says that you've received this Holy Spirit the new birth you walk through all this and he said you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you when you walk this way then you come to he said then when you receive this power then you are to be Witnesses unto me see now then it's not just walking but now we're supposed to be witnesses that to Proclaim these things see we continue to walk in these things and understand the things that God has for us to be witnesses to the people to show all these things now one more thing I want to get to and this is to understand about Witnesses and this is First Corinthians chapter 13 and verse 9. and and Paul's writing it says and he says for we know in part and we prophesy in part he said but that which is but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away he said when I when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things he said for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face for I now for I now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known you know when you when you begin to look at these things and you see these things that take place and you understand why certain things take place and and happen but you know when you're a child is we looking back in childhood and you know we have experiences and things that happen we don't want to always understand why things happen the way they do but you know it comes with with growth and it comes with in time you receive Clarity on these things and and you know uh I I was just thinking about my dad you know and you know you grow up and you know they always tell you know well when you get older you'll understand these things well you know sometimes you think well I don't think I'll ever understand this but you know it takes in time you do understand you didn't begin to understand these things and you do begin to see these things and and Paul's ready to say you know we understand as a child we thought as a child but he said well we become as maturity takes place he said then we begin to understand these things and there's lots of times in our lives we see things that happen and we don't understand and one of the things when I was reading this article this uh what struck me is you know lots of times when people look about this about the things in the scripture and everything you know God didn't always write things in the first action reports as if you were in the Army and or the military you know they always talk about the first action reports and that's the first reports that come from the battlefields when they first come in and something happens the first thing that that's the first you know what goes to headquarters that first action report this is what happened well you know there's only you know you're so um blinded by that you got blinders on you're going I see so much because of what took place but you know in time because you you gather more information there's more intelligence more things take place then all of a sudden you begin to see more things and they understand those first action reports because they're things that get left out and so one of the things that they were writing about was why did why did it take to the first century for them to write the gospels and it's like well you know what because maybe because because though those people riding back there would have seen it they were like first action reports and they're waiting but all of a sudden as they begin to grow and become the maturity then all of a sudden when they look back to the life of Jesus Christ and they began to write the gospels then all of a sudden they could see the things that took place and they said oh well now we understand those things because we're not children anymore now as we begin in maturity have Clarity of the scripture now we can write this to the gospels now we understand these things we understand what Jesus was speaking of and we're now and then all of a sudden when it begins to write all these things there's like well they're just writing all the gospels as Hocus Pocus no because God knows what he's doing because he knows exactly when he wanted to write them and who what he wrote to write these things to understand to see the clarity and so many times in our lives we have things that happen and we don't understand why things happen the way they do but you know when it in time God begins to show us Clarity and show us these things why because we're no more children to be tossed about to and fro but all of a sudden in time we begin to receive Clarity of the word and because as he begins to manifest himself in us as we begin to grow we've become up the statue of a perfect man it's more of him and us and we begin to see more we begin to understand these things why because I thank God the things that I went through as a child because you know what I didn't understand them and I didn't appreciate them then but I tell you what I appreciate them a whole lot more this morning after being reaching 49 years old that I appreciate a lot of things I went through I didn't appreciate then and why because it takes age it takes experiences it takes trials and hardships and all these things and then all of a sudden when these things take place you say thank God for what I've come through then you look back over your life and you see all the things that you've been through and you can see the goodness of God in your life you can see these things why because God has done all this in my life and I can see the goodness of God I just want to share one more thing how the musicians come before we close this morning but you know I I was thinking about brother Branham and brother Brown's talking about that young lady that had come and she was her family been in and out of the church and her mom and them and that married lady let's all stand this morning and the lady she was married she had two children and she was dying she was she had had a pregnancy that had had went bad and they were going to have to take the baby and you know they they were there and y'all know the story is as she was going through all of that and they called for brother Brandon to come to the hospital and pray with them and you know at that time she would be going up there and they were telling about all this stuff that was happening and brother Branham Master said are you right with God and she said no brother Bill I'm not and brother Branham gets down there and they pray with her and you know they you know because brother Ram told her said listen do you realize that you're dying said yes I understand because of the pregnancy they weren't able to do anything she was dying hey brother Brian prayed for and she gave her heart to the Lord and then her husband you know hey come back to the Lord and her her mother had come back to the Lord and you know all those things and brother about him seen all the goodness of God in their lives and all the things that was taking place and you know they were laying there and they kept giving her medicine everything and she got better and after she had went through all of that she got better they were going to do the surgery well praise the Lord looks like she's going to survive but you know the story is as they she was laying there in the hospital and she talks to her mother and it was late at night and she tells her mom said mother I'm leaving and brother Brian you know he as he describes the story and say well you know honey I understand you're gonna have the surgery you'll go home in a little bit you know after the surgery everything will be fine you'll go home and she told her mom said no mama you don't understand I'm going to my heavenly home and your brother Brandon was so so tore up in that situation because you know a little bit later she passed away and and he was not in town when they had her funeral and when he come back to town he was talking to Sister Mita and you know brother Brandon said I was so upset by all of that and you know he said I didn't know what to do and he said I don't know why I done it but he stood there and he said he told that he said I don't know what caused me to do it but he said Lord God he said you owe me an understanding see after me going out there and telling that husband and tell them come to the Lord after you've done these things for him and all that and then they take that girl's life like that said you owe me an understanding when you tell God something like that he'll leave you alone he said he don't owe me nothing I'm in debt to him well he just let me pout it out for a few days you know after about three or four months one day I was out there on the creek bank and the Lord spoke to me in a vision he said now you go tell her mother I say this to her mother did not her time come the year before that when she was drowning in a creek on a picnic she should have went at that time but I had to take her when she was ready to go and that's why all this happened and while you went out there then I got down and cried and said Lord Jesus forgive me your poor stupid servant I should have never said that and then he went down there to begin to talk to that to the mother and how she got tied up in that Creek and the goodness of God to her was that she waited God had mercy on her and when she was ready to go God called for and brother Brandon was so upset by that they said Lord you owe me an explanation God doesn't owe us anything see we walk by faith and not by sight and not and not to charge God foolishly because you know what he's got it all in control we walk as children who as child we understood as a child he said but when we came a man we put away childish things we don't know how we're going to get the answers or if we ever get answers there's lots of things we don't understand and we may not ever understand them on this side but I want to say thank God I know it's in his control and say Lord I want to put my my trust and confidence in you Lord you lead us and guide us give us what we have need of I don't I don't want to try to figure these things out I want to be in I want to be in your perfect will and the light that you'd have us walk in amen God bless you this morning let's let's sing a song [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] the Sun [Music] shine oh yes I feel like traveling [Music] traveling on my heavenly homies [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're dismissed remember services [Music] [Music]
