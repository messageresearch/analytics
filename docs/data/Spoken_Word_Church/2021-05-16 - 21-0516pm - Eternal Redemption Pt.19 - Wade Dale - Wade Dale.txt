address signed on the highway so you can't miss it really easy to find all right that's what we'll be having sunday service on july the 4th so good to be in the house of the lord if you've got your bibles let's turn to hebrews 9 and continue on our thought with the eternal redemption we'll get into a little thought maybe toward the end that we haven't discussed yet because we're heading we've got uh we got to talk about this man that the plan's hinged on them it's hinged on jesus christ amen it's not hinged on me and you we are a part of the plan but it's hinged on him getting us out of the problem we had and the plan is helping us to get out of that amen because we can't get out of it ourselves man has tried for years and years and thousands of years to save themselves and they can't do it all right so hebrews 9 remember these announcements and like i said thank you all again for going to you're doing your sunday school duty and everybody doing it in orderly fashion there was no disruption there was no um uh calamity it was all done really well and i appreciate that and all you uh uh sunday school teachers thank you so very much for what you do hebrews 9 verse 11 let's pray dear heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us we pray now that you sanctify us for this journey that we're on lord please lord you be the one that comes and does the speaking you be the one that does the revealing father we pray that you'd be with the ones that are sick the ones that are not here today lord the ones that have ailments in their bodies we pray that you just touch them lord and heal them lord even as the word goes forth you said lord you sent your word and healed the people and delivered them from destruction lord thank you for the ones that are here lord we pray that there will be a something said today that'll it'll just fire up that spirituality part of us lord towards you and that we'll have a better relationship with with you father and and shed the world off at least for a few moments lord to listen to what's being said father just take care of us lead us in guide us by your holy spirit bless people the best brother bob lord on the way back home father for doing his duty there in occasional and one's lord that are out doing other things we pray that you just touch each one bless us in jesus name amen but christ being come a high priest of good things to come by a greater more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building i've been reading in solomon about how they built that building man what a building they built god in the old testament there what a building they took them 30 years almost to build that building and to build a place for solomon to live and they and they didn't even have they it was so perfect until they had the plan laid out they knew that this rock needed to be 15 inches wide and somebody over there made it and had it shipped there it's kind of like a prefab that we have a prefab house now because the bible said no hammer and no saul was heard in the building of the temple no hammer no saw everything and you know what that's a testament that the word of god is right the word of god will fit together if you'll let it they don't have to be no bunch of noise a hammer and nails and all that stuff if you'll just let god he's already got the pieces the pieces are there for us to what just put it where it's supposed to go that's the thing put it where it's supposed to go neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us you may be seated let's read first john 4 and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him hereby is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because he as he is or are we in the world i'm glad brother dale covered that about the judgment because it is confusing to the world it shouldn't be confusing to the bride that we don't stand the major judgment of anything we don't stand we're not in the major tribulation we're not major judgment but there are things if we don't get taken care of like the thing that i had with the brother that i said something about and i had to get it right if i only got that right i was going to meet that not at the day of judgment but at the reward ceremony remember brother branham had a reward ceremony remember they were giving him his reward and remember hope came up on this side and and and the media came up on this side and they went up the steps to get his reward and they told him he was a special person why because he gave his life to get me and you the gospel so there's there are there are levels and i don't understand because there's not a level of eternal life eternal is eternal but there is positions there and you say well i thought we all going to be one well we are going to be one but remember israel will never be the bride adam you got abraham you've got all eyes they are not won't be bright and never will be bright they have a position because i'll read it here that remember jehovah had to divorce his first bride right so she'll never carry that position again as the bride we're the bride we live in the city they can come in the city and go out of the city but the bible even tells us that the kings of the earth will bring their goods into the city and i like what brother claude said they bring their tithes in but there are kings so there must be a hierarchy and it must be some kind of it's not anarchy but there must be some kind of a government set up outside the temple or outside the new city and it won't be that well i'm better than you but it will be that you know you may have done better than me in a certain situation you've been done better than brother louise in a certain situation and you'll be known for that because i believe brother brown will always be known as the prophet of the end time he'll never lose that he'll never lose that title so that's the same way but now remember like what i was reading there in timothy if you don't get it confessed and get it out of the way brother michael was confessing just a few minutes ago he did had to do the same thing about somebody it makes you feel so good and so clean you never have to worry about that anymore so that doesn't have that will not be a a a crown taken away that'll be actually a crown given because you went an extra step to ask forgiveness but if not then that thing has to go with us right some sin some man sin go before some go after all right so if we send that sin and let it be covered by the blood and we take this love to where watch now see we get down to verse 20. if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he also seen how can he love god whom we have not seen so there you go that's why brotherly love is way up there on that pyramid it's not down at the bottom because it's a character development that we all need to develop that we all need to have working in our life all right so let's read ephesians one according that has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world i sent her this morning i thought man as many times as brother dale brother louise brother bob and myself and brother aaron's read that scripture in the past two months they ought not be no questions we can almost quote it by heart because we've all used it in our sermon in some part in the past several months but you know what when god does that i think he's trying to tell us something according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love there's a position that we've got to come to that we should be holding without blame when you say my my listen god don't blame you the devil's the one that does the blaming okay so if we do go without blame we're listening to god and as john told us he said if you don't have the love of god you don't understand what the love of god is and you can't have the love of god you look at the world the world is trading agape love with what they think is agape love they're just it's just filial love and it'll only come to a certain spot and it will end same way with the people that send the message if they have true agape love you'll never leave the message of the hour you may have listen you might have questions you may have problems you may have situations where you don't understand things but you'll never ever in your soul say this is not right right because how can agape love contradict agape love but now filial love will always contradict agape love you can't trade them they can't be traded and you can't carry a filial love into another dimension but you can take agape love into any dimension you want to amen hey even agape love went to the fifth dimension but he didn't stay that long amen jesus went to went to hell that was agape love but see that was the love of god to even go to hell to tell them people i'm the one you turned down you made a choice to be where you're at and i can't do anything about it though i'm almighty god and i have the perfect love i can't take you out of that situation i was reading the other day brother brown said death doesn't change anything just your dwelling place if you're a sour here you're gonna be sour there if you're xyz you're gonna be xyz there it's not gonna and i think maybe sometimes the the denominational world and i don't even know maybe some of the people the message think that you know once they die and go over into another dimension that that that's going to better themselves no this is where you get better or this is where you get worse see that's the eternal plan of redemption that god had to come into this part of our world that was fallen that we knew we were going to die and listen we were spiritually dead he had to come into this dimension and bring agape level show me because listen brother brown said outside of the bride there'll be no love why because the bride will be the only one that has agape love and agape love is translated the new birth there is no agape love outside a new birth and there is no new birth outside of agape love now brother brown i read you that quote where brother brown said you love with your spirit but that's only filial love that's not agape love never can and never will be if it stays in your outside realm or your second realm of you you're lost on the inside agape love is not squishy ushy gushy greasy grace love agape love is corrective love it's love that god loves you and he wants to tell you he's already told you in the bible the problem is is we sometimes say well that's not god because it's too hard or that's not god because i don't think god would have me do that i was a girl a couple days ago talking about going to church and one of the guys at work asked the girl there said do you wear your jeans to church you know what they always say god knows my heart doesn't matter what i wear god knows my heart and i thought yep he does that's why you go to church with your pants on because god knows your heart but see let me tell you something unless that girl gets born again she's gonna have to meet god with that same attitude right that's right and he's going to say i know your heart because i and see they think but see that's what i'm saying is they think that negates what the word said but i love god so i'm going to go to church naked but i love god right right or i'm going to go do this and do that because listen the devil has sold this plan he has a plan too it's not a plan of redemption it's a plan of destruction and he wants to destroy this whole plan of redemption but listen if it's an eternal plan satan cannot get his greasy hands on an eternal plan because there's nothing about him eternal he can't make eternal he can't give eternal he has no eternal to get listen that's something you can do that the devil can't do you can give your eternal life away or you can connect somebody to your eternal life a cup of water in my name change my tire on the side of the road you can impart eternal life something satan cannot do he only imparts evil but see he uses filial love to make you think you've got a guppy love and that's what's happening in the message of the hour they just think it's shouting and speaking in tongues and and whooped you do and i felt that so it must be good okay it's okay so let's see how the life let's continue that's why god's let this thing go so long he's continued to allow us to go so long to where that what happened with a mixed multitude what happened with the ones that died in the wilderness they just kept going away going away whether it was only two original joshua and caleb was the only two listen moses was even gone there was just joshua and caleb and a group that had grown up that didn't know the first group of people and god has done that now he's raised up not a young as far as young age but a young group of people coming to the end time that's going to be able to go across that promised land and not only go across the promised land but to be positionally placed as we read this here because this is all look at verse 5 having predestinated us unto adoption not just to a child but to adoption to where you and i can speak and things will happen that's right i'm just telling you what god said to the praise of the glory of his grace when he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace when he hath the boundary toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the brother devil saying this morning the mystery of his will what's the mystery of his will to adopt you to save you to make you a child of god that's the mystery you know listen don't you can't talk about adoption or growth development out in the in the denominational world and most of the message people don't think you have to have that what what do you mean i got to go i got everything when i believed you might have got a part but you just came into a place that you could get it see you can't get any of that see brother branham when he preached statue a perfect man he knew there was some because of filial love they could go up that statue of a perfect man and just be a human right that's what he said he said you can have some of these virtues without having the holy ghost but you can't have holy ghost temperance you can't have holy ghost patience without having the agape love to connect it to right now it just won't fit right but if you have agape love that's why the prophet of god my brother dale said many times and i agree that there's a lot of people in this message that does not have the new birth because they've never been taught right they've never been taught well and they're just sitting in a message church and dying because if you have agape love folks if you have agape love which is the new birth it will connect to brother brown said every word in the bible so every word in the bible says faith virtue knowledge temperatures godliness are required virtues and it takes a five-fold ministry apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists to bring you that only under agape love can you have that whole deal the whole plan is hands on you having the new birth and it hinged on you as as john says here believing something you hadn't even seen how can you says if a man say i love god and hate this is brother for he that loveth not his brother whom he in sin how can he love god who is not sinned right right we haven't seen god but we have now we have now through his word we know where to look for him at amen we know to look that we had a prophet that turned us literally turned us back to the faith of the fathers look that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in christ listen there's not 10 brides there's not two brides there's one bride and we know who that is now because the methodists say we're bright the pentecost say we're bright the baptist says we're bright the people says always was eternal they say they're bright so who's bride you gotta know right right you gotta know whose bride but we gotta keep going on and on and on because look in whom also we have obtained an inheritance we literally obtained this we weren't born with it listen if you were born perfect why all the trouble what kind of testimony would you have really come on i told my kids they wanted to be famous i said just do everything your parents told you told you to do i said you'll be famous nobody's ever done it in the world they dab they say how can i be famous i said you'll be on oprah winfrey and all the mother shows if you can stand up and say without lying i did exactly what my parents told me to do they ain't a person on earth ever did that except one that's right right and he had a problem with his parents at one time jesus did of course you know that in him also we have obtained redemption or inherit an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him that worketh all things after the council of his own will let's read this next quote tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of god was ever to be manifested outside of this time now now this is the prophet telling us only in the end time when will there ever time in history that to manifest the time to deliver all nature you see moses had a had an anointing to do what he was supposed to do but he didn't deliver on nature now all nature fell on egypt almost but we're talking about to bring this thing back every i was thinking this the other day everybody brought it back to a degree to upright everybody brought it to a degree and then they had to stop because they didn't have the fullness of the word and you know even baptist and methodists they brought it to a degree god was working through those denominations before they were denominations he was working with the word they had but what did they do they stopped god said don't stop keep moving they said no this is it right here once saved always saved don't have to worry about it no more let me just sprinkle you don't worry about it no more let me just speak in tongues don't worry about it no more you're born again we'll say god just said no i'm moving on that's why god had to bring us a prophet that he moved on in the astronaut age and to deliver all nature nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of manifestation now we know that's romans 8 verse 14 through about 20 why before the atonement was made before the holy ghost was ever poured out in the old testament on down look there couldn't have been manifestations it had to wait till this time now all things have been brought coming shaping to a headstone to the manifestation of the sons of god coming back and the spirit of god coming into these men so perfectly until the ministry will be so close like christ till they'll join him and his church together now how in the world are we going to have a ministry like jesus christ if you have agape love you're on the road right there already but if you don't have agape love you you just had to love that the pharaoh had or or love that kaifas had or all the different ones like that they had a certain portion of love that they could love but you know what when the very epitome of agape love when the very headstone of love walked into their temple right they killed him they killed him called him beelzebub called him the prince of devils called him the worst of the worst wine bibber all he done was hung around prostitutes and centers and that was agape love sitting there the epitome not just the part of he was all of agape love everything he was what do you think how do you think peter patterned these virtues from from jesus christ that's where he got him from he didn't get them from nobody else he got them from jesus christ which was perfect love but we had a prophet that went over into another dimension called the sixth dimension and he saw that let's skip on to that if you don't mind brothers and go to number two we know about the dimensions now one two three four five and six we've been through them all we're going to kind of get away from that now and keep on continue going to uh perfect love just keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going there you go all right he says look this is perfect love go down to the red or the yellow for y'all this is perfect love said isn't that what you spoke the holy spirit was i said yes and this is perfect love that's what he went across the curtain of time now watch him in hebrews chapter four number three quote says the first is perfect love that's god's love pure and unadulterated now see it's not greasy grace it's not sloppy sloppy love right this love has judgment behind it this love is a righteous judge listen god would that all would be saved all right see that's agape love that he would that all be saved but in order to be god and to be a righteous judge he had to allow you to make a choice whether you would accept that agape love or not and some will and some will not but we know one thing's for sure when brother brown went across that curtain of time that's all he saw you can say perfect love agape love same same thing that's all he saw he didn't run into somebody that didn't have it he didn't run into he didn't see of the millions of people he didn't see one that didn't have it no every one of them had it but listen they didn't receive it there they received it right here this is where you receive perfect love this is where you receive agape love i think a lot of people are waiting to get perfect over there and you you look you look at your denominational world you say oh well when i get over yonder well i hope they're over yonder ain't the over yonder that ain't a good over yonder you understand what i mean but that's what they've been taught and that's all that we can go by but we've been taught different you and i have been taught the correct way to receive agape love and what to do when that agape love comes amen all of you and as brother ryan was talking about this morning what happens you're born with a gift see elvis presley was born with a gift there's no doubt and there's a lot of other great entertainers and even you say comedian anybody that can can take a thought whether it be evil or good that can take a thought and make hold people's attention and make them laugh or make them cry they've got a gift there's a gift there but what you have to attach it to either the devil or to god right same way with with um what did he say about elvis presley sold his soul for a fleet of cadillacs well see he was telling us he was a pentecostal boy a good pentecostal boy when he was growing up but he took that anointing and what'd he do with it he turned it over to the devil for money but he could have turned it over to god and been probably one of the like billy graham and and oral roberts and some be some great something because he had such an anointing listen you read some of these people what kind of anointing they had what kind of presence they had when they walked into the room even other things that go on that they could make women do and make men do and make people do things that that's ungodly but what if they were to turn that and that's the same thing brother dale myself any good minister we're not trying to make you do something right but what we're doing is opening up a channel so that you can see what god's already said we're not bringing some kind of new thought you know there's not some res reservation in there no it's all been open right if you've read anything of the of the message of the hour you know the principles are like i said you know the essence of the message all the other things are the other peripherals it's already in the bible then it's like i said before the people leave the message they just throw they must throw the bible out because they start cutting their hair and smoking and drinking and that that was in the bible before william branham got here that was taught back in old pentecost so why not if you're going to go back to something go back to that that's right at least you might have a chance over there but you won't have no chance you just leave the greatest thing it ever was and you turn yourself out to nothing and it's happening all the time because look the next comes in filial love that's love that you have for your wife and your children the next drop after that is what lustful love the next is ungodly love and that's what you yield yourself to kids don't yield yourself to even playing music of the world if you can help it now concerts and things like that you have to do let's not be so dogmatic right you know huh scoop thank you josh school concerts i i there's a reason i had him school kind of school concerts but but that's really that's what i meant any kind of something that you're you know told to play beethoven's fifth symphony play it you're in school do the thing don't make it a rock and roll party that's gonna be one of the part that you're gonna have to deal with but use your talent for the glory of the lord because you know what you have an anointing you have an anointing just every one of these this this is just this is just instruments to use and to channel your anointing through i don't know why i guess i'm picking up on what brother dale talking this morning but it's a channel that you channel what you have already you take a piece of music or you take a scripture or you take the prophet's message and you weave together something that you try by the lord by the help of the lord that you you convey it to one person maybe today just one person is going to get this today but that person being a child of god god's not going to leave them hungry he's going to feed them whether the rest of you say well i'm full i got full for i got here it's like louise said you know sometimes we do we think well we don't heard all this about 20 times no there's always a little something that you can get there's always god will never return void his word will never return void it will accomplish what it's set out to do the problem is is we quench the spirit of god by our attitude right that's right this is not part of the service but let's just continue down that road the next is ungodly love and just goes down until it's filth and keeps on perverting perverting and like brothers dale says listen you all got a gift everybody does of something but if you'll use it and stay in that gift it's like then brother brown said no if you got you know if you got an anointing of ephraim what are you doing over in manassas cornfield what are you doing over here you need to get into what hey listen this plan needs people this plan of redemption and you know what god saw you fit into that anointing you just got to figure out whether it's you or god listen if you're a born-again christian to help brother ryan with his question this morning if you're a born-again christian did i not say prayer was a vehicle to talk straight to god you don't have to go and you don't have to listen you don't have to find a mentor right you talk straight to god now listen god may choose to speak to you through brother dale but he's not the mediator amen we've got one mediator and that's jesus christ because he can't forgive your sins i can't forgive your sins but i can help you pray i can try to get you in a channel that's what a song leader does gets you in a channel so that god can talk to you see we think well now brother boyd's gonna get up and he's gonna sing three songs brother the way he's gonna come out and he's gonna preach and that's it no they're setting a stage in a channel so that god can talk straight to you through the ministry to me that's agape love and he'll not leave one of us not one of us he'll leave us behind will not leave us behind folks i promise you he will not you say well i don't understand i don't understand if you've got agape love somewhere god is obligated to put somebody in the pulpit you can understand right yes because he's not going to let why confuse your own kids right why would god confuse his own children the bible tells us why if your child asks for bread you give it a piece give it a stone he asked for meat you give it a scorpion what kind of daddy is that no he's a good dad he's a good dad let's continue on number four let's read the red except you have that perfect love you'll never be there because nothing could ever be there without it this is what we've been touching on i got a little head i'm sorry but your spirit would be out of place there you see when when elvis presley was probably in the anointing of the of the pentecostal realm man it was good because he had an anointing people would listen and they would respond to him but what did he do he got caught up in his self and he took on another spirit and it wasn't holy amen so that pushed him in another direction and that took him where he was at and brother brown said sent more people to hell than the bar joint bar joints at that day would send to hell he sent them to hell wow let's read number five brother dale's talking about gifts look where there is gifts they can be questioned but when there is love it is perfect that's right and if you had perfect love you'd have perfect gifts that's right so work first with love that brings fellowship and fellowship brings gifts amen because you don't want to have worthy knowledge you want to have knowledge of god you don't have just regular normal faith you want to have the faith of god these virtues are the virtues of god and it takes a perfect faith to have that look at number six christ is revealed in his own word it's that anointing now this is only in this age that layout of cna is naked blind miserable don't even know it it's that anointed anointed with the real spirit see that holy spirit can fall upon a man in his spirit but his soul is his german that germ is the word and how i don't care how much you can preach how well you do this and how much you love that's one of the inlets to spirit you can't love you can't love with your body you love with your spirit that's one of the endless and you can love and even love god and still not be right you can cast out devils and preach and do these things still not be right jesus said so said many would come in that day that word settles it in other words the word is the whole thing that we're looking at today we're going to read that in just a minute where god sent the word to us john 1 1 said in the beginning was the word where was with god and the word was god but let's read number seven this is a quote i quoted you wednesday night real genuine love will create a confidence in his word real genuine love will create a confidence in his word i love that now the next quote we'll get started here we're gonna we were looking at the chart where jesus comes into play because look david when we were talking about prayer this this morning david knew there was a messiah coming all the people in the old testament knew there was a messiah that was coming but they'd never seen him before they'd seen him in part through different prophets in the word and the different things that they brought but they knew it had to be blood that come in to bring this thing to pass so god had to create to bring blood into the world to offer that blood so god had to create himself a blood cell so he did that by what becoming a baby he became a baby behold isaiah 7 verse 14 says behold a virgin shall conceive and bear it's son and shall call his name emmanuel everybody in the old testament was looking toward that they were looking for something to come they were looking for the redeemer even job says i i know there's a problem here i know my redeemer liveth i know that i in the last day i'll stand on my in my own body and in my flesh i shall see god but they didn't see him in there but look matthew 1 verse 19 says jesus when he was born remember joseph had a dream because it was kind of hard for him to conceive that she had conceived but this child is conceived by the holy ghost and she shall bring forth a son now shall call his name jesus for he shall save his people now look save his people from their sins today we're going to cover that's what i've been trying to get to because remember he came to a group of people he didn't come to gentiles not at first because the whole old testament was what jews jews there's a spattering of gentiles every once in a while got put into that you saw brother brown this morning talked about rahab and all the different ones that there was a few gentiles but but jehovah had a bride that was jewish because that was his first people that was his chosen bride that was the ones he was going to work through but now remember god knows all things he knew what they would do and he knew he would want to get a gentile bride so he sent jesus and jesus stood up one day and said don't go to nobody but my people go to the lost sheep of the house of israel don't even go the gentile call them dogs but deep down inside of that man somewhere he knew that he was going to have a gentile bride because every time he would come up against a gentile the centurion the woman he called the dog and all the different ones he would get he said i've never seen faith like this in israel so he knew that the gentile bride would have more faith because what does israel have faith in signs touch me remember jarrius come and lay hands on her come and do this brother brown talks about it many times a jew you've got to have what signs that's why god's got to send two prophets to israel when we're out of here he's got to send them two prophets and they're going to do signs and wonder signs and wonder signs of wonder signs and wonders yeah because they're jewish they have to have that but we read yet wednesday isaiah 53 and i believe we should read it again who hath believed our report to whom his arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he hath no form or commonness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him in other words he wanted an elvis presley he wasn't somebody that was that was easy to pick out in a crowd he kind of fit in he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with grief we hit as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not listen even the 12 well the 11 disciples that were with him they left him at calvary they did not really know what was going on they knew this man was different they knew it was special i know what peter said thou art the christ but i don't he said you heard that from my father right then he tell peter he said you heard that from my dad you didn't you didn't get that on yourself you heard that from my father he put that in your mouth to speak that because you don't understand who i am but when you interject agape love into that on the day of pentecost they understood right cause peter stood up and preached the sermon listen to this have y'all lost my y'all lost my quotes back there if you need to go back to wednesday night on number 18 if you need to surely he has borne our grief and carried our sorrows because this is basically what us preach wednesday night except for a few added few added um scriptures but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes we are here we are healed and as i said before he was a lamb of god he was the sin bearer he was the one that was put on the altar he was the one that was beaten and bruised for your healing but healing is only temporary the bible says right here that he gave his soul a ransom so that he could see his seed and we're going to talk about because remember what happens in the bible in the parable of the sore of the seed who's the sore of the seed the son of man the son of man's the sore of the seed that was jesus christ in human flesh he was the sower of that seed as we all sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he didn't have a wonderful time here you know he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation so who's going to declare his generation only people that are born again listen there's been generation upon generation upon generation upon generation but there's never been a generation that was born without sex right never never been a generation that didn't have some kind of an act or some kind of genealogy going one way or the other right so this the bible says who shall declare his generation because or for he was cut off out of the land of living listen isaiah caught down and said well this guy's going to die he's going to die and not have any children how is he going to be this person that's going to give eternal life to everybody well you're going to see it right here and he made his grave with the wicked with the rich in his death because he hath done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed amen not a progeny from the earth or a progeny from from somebody doing something here on earth no it came from almighty god he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul listen his soul was what was in anguish on the on the cross his soul was what what his soul is what he was giving for your soul his soul is what was paying the price not the body the body paid for the healing part the body was the lamb but that and that listen that human body didn't come back on you that's right right and i'm not to say it didn't do any good but i'm telling you what i'm saying is the literal body of jesus doesn't make you eternal it's the soul the soul of jesus christ is what makes you eternal because he can he knows listen when he looked around he saw that genealogy that was produced by the garden by sex and he knew i believe in his in his mind he's like man these people are trapped there's nothing they can do this is a cycle they've got to be born by sex die go into whatever dimension but he knew that if he could give his life give his soul a ransom he would see a seed he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong why because he has poured out his soul unto death you can't kill you can't kill a soul the one that can kill a soul is the one he's talking about you can't kill a soul soul's not there's not a soul died yet that's right they're somewhere they're in a slot they're in a dimension somewhere that they're they've got to wait till the day of judgment listen i just think about this other day even though god knows every person exactly what they're going to say at the judgment and exactly what's going to go on at judgment he's still going to let them present their case why would we have a white throne judgment if he wasn't going to let them give their case right because the bible tells us that many will come in that day and say have i not they're going to make a case have i not healed the sick have i not cast out devils he said depart from me i never had an agape love relationship with you and that's exactly what it is because he has poured out his soul unto death jesus was on the cross he said into thy hands i commend my spirit and that spirit went to hell and preached to the what the ones and the souls that were long suffering of the days of noah he knew me he knew they were going to they were going to die and reject him too but you know what he still had to go through the plan even though the plan of revelations 13 8 says he was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world he had to come down here and die of the death you know who he has proven it to the devil he's proven all this to satan that hey i'm god you got them people into the problem they're in i'm going to get them out the ones that will believe me and satan says ah they're not gonna all believe you i'll just get all the ones i can and that's what he's trying to do he's trying to get as many as he can and round them up together and preach a sermon like he did i guess to the angels back before time that's his job so now let's go to john 1 1. the bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him i want to ask sometimes you know if jesus is the second person of the trinity to denominational people i want to ask for where he fit in in this creation because the bible tells us in many many places even somebody one of the disciples says you're the creator i want somebody to explain to me why did did the father just stand there and watch him do the creating or or you know what is this what's the deal here the bible says all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in other words there's nothing in the world made that god didn't make there was a man sent from john noah in him was life and life was a lot of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light now remember john wasn't the light the prophet of god in the end time was not the light the light was we were pointed to the correct light listen satan is a god of light and i'm sure there's people pointing and saying well there there's god right there there's god right there there's god right there but john said behold glory the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world this and there was no doubt especially in john's mind now we know a little bit later that john had a little bit of issue with that but listen he was dir directing a group of people to look at this man jesus you need to watch him that's the lamb of god to take away the sin of the world i don't know how is it all going to happen right he was not that light but he was sent to bear witness of that lightness what we had in the end time that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not now listen this is one we'll bring right here he came unto his own and his own received him not jesus came to save the jewish people israel the lost sheep of the house of israel jesus came to give them an opportunity first because they were his first love but look but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh now he's not looking then to israel because listen all israel was born flesh there was no new birth in the old testament so there was no regening or regeneration it was natural genealogy but he said but which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh what carnally by sex nor of the will of man but of god so he's bringing a whole new generation in here that's we go back to isaiah who shall declare his generation well listen it started on the day of pentecost and it has not ended yet there's a generation declaration and every every time that god does something he's got them in seven church ages and in all of us right up to the end which were born not of blood and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now let's go to jeremiah now remember jesus came virgin born we know that he was born a man could perform as a as a man because he was ever with man but he sanctified himself because he did he knew one thing's for sure all this sex that was going on around him that was producing people was killing them right right so he knew he had he had to come up with a plan see there but it wasn't then he'd already done it before the foundation of the world to birth us by spiritual birth that's why he told the sower the seed was the son of man what is the seed it's the word what do you get you're getting you're getting regened by the word of god not buy something out there i can't have a different daddy seeing these first three dimensions you're locked into your gym natural genealogy sorry you just are there's a lot of you can pick your friends but you can't pick your family remember there's other things but there's one thing you can't pick you're born into this but you know what god knew that but see you have a choice whether it be get into this family of god or not you have a choice it's your choice to be follow me paul said in the regening or the regeneration follow me into the regeneration you've got to go somewhere to get regene and it's the word of god now watch this in jeremiah we know the jesus came a virgin he came to sow seed but look that seed that he sowed they never had him they never had jesus in the old testament i'm talking about savior of the old testament while the old testament we know he was coming under the old testament we know that right but he was the testator of the new testament because the new testament became sowing of spiritual seed not natural seed everybody got that because look it said in jeremiah 3 verse 6 said the lord said also unto me in the day of josiah the king hast thou seen that which backsliding israel hath done she has gone up upon every high mountain and under evergreen tree and there has played the harlot and i said after she had done all these things turn thou unto me but she returned not and her treacherous sister judah saw it now watch and i saw when for all the causes where with backsliding israel committed adultery i had put her away and give her a bill of divorcement yet her treacherous sister judah feared not but went and played the harlot also so god divorced her in the old testament put her away because of her whoredom she went after other gods if you'll read in first and second kings and reading chronicles there'll be a king rise up and he'll destroy every grove except for the high grove josiah i think he was pretty much the only one that destroyed it all but then you'd have another king come up asa would come up king asa would come up and he'd destroy a certain amount but he wouldn't destroy all of it then this one would wouldn't destroy none he'd go right back to what he'd go right back to idols and balaam and and i just never could understand why there had to be a religion where you had to put your kids and sacrifice your children what was that moloch moloch that was what they done that was a religion you went to a place you went to a chapel and you put your kid up on the altar and you had them burnt for this god are we that serious about ours some of you more serious about sleep yet her treacherous sister judah fear not look at romans 11 25 and i'm gonna stop right there don't seem like we're getting anywhere and i guess the excitement's gone so maybe god will put you away romans 11 verse 25 let's see if they can find that and we'll read it because i want you to see this now remember jesus was the plan he was he wasn't part of the plan he was the plan of redemption and he knew that israel was going to fall that they would need redemption that he had to come in flesh but remember when he got here he done one thing to them and then took a gentile bride and he did this just for me and you so romans 11 verse 25 says for i would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles be come in and so all israel shall be saved listen it's not that he's choked israel out on the side of the road he's going to save her but she's not she did what we were talking about a few minutes ago she lost a position by the way she acted you and i could lose a position by the way we acted or the way we act we could lose a position because israel lost a position that jesus at one time said don't go anywhere but the lost sheep of the house of israel and he came to his own but we know his own received him not but he kept going to the jews and going to the jews and going to the jews but he finally knew one thing right here in romans 11 verse 25 you say jesus knew well he was talking through paul the holy ghost was talking through paul right said that blindness in part has happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles be come in and so all israel shall be saved added as it is written there shall come out of zion the deliverance shall turn away ungodliness from jacob for this is my covenant unto them he made a covenant with them i can't forget israel how can i forget israel he can't forget those people listen there were some mighty prophets how are you going to do away with isaiah jeremiah abraham you can't do away with them and even listen those are just people that's in the bible there are some mighty people in the bible look at look at hebrews 11. barack and all the different ones and even the prophets the little minor prophets there wasn't much spoken but boy they come in they bring a message and boom it would be something for israel well they'd either turn him down or they'd do what he said most suddenly turn them down there shall come out of zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins now how is he going to take away their sins go back to isaiah 53 he's got to give his soul he didn't just give his soul the ransom for me and you he gave a soul ransom for israel and for us to bring everybody in so that they'll be able to live and be given eternal life but see that very soul couldn't come back into those believers but that very soul is in me and you today if you've got the new birth that very soul that he gave a ransom that's why sometimes when you tell people look you've already been to hell you don't have to go i really believe that now me as a person i wasn't down there standing beside jesus no i was inside of his genetic makeup because that wasn't a body that came down there to hell it was his soul it was a king theophany it was the one that's genesis 1 26 it was part of that genesis 1 26 it was the genesis 1 26 man amen and you're part of that so you've already been to hell how do you think one more time how do you think we can understand a word like we do and not have the new birth the same person that wrote it is looking through your eyes but this plan had to bring a group of people called israelites or jews because they were his first love they were his first ones that he fell in love with knowing they were going to absolutely kill every prophet he sent and turn him down and that he was going to have to listen he literally blinded them because think of how religious they were though take isaiah and jeremiah and all those different ones that by a prophetic utterance they could see not maybe jesus christ standing like we see him but they knew there was something coming they just couldn't put their finger on it there was something coming because even paul said i see through a glass darkly i don't see all things amen but he literally had to put his hand over israel's eye and blinded them for me and you that was part of the plan though but he said i won't forget them for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sake let me read that again as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sake he's talking to gentiles he's talking to a gentile bride but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake so you're not kicking israel out that's right they're enemies for your sake to bring you in and then god's going to do what he's going to israel they are beloved for the father's sake listen to this for the gifts and calling well somebody used to read somebody read that not too long ago right that's part of what brother dale's been reading because gift and calling gifts and callings are without repentance that's right but as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sake just to get you in he literally blind listen because they're not listen how many how many years have we been since the day of pentecost which was 80 30 to this day that we're at today we're still trying to understand one god i mean we understand it more than anybody ever has but it's been all convoluted down through the ages but listen israel had it right to start with that's why when when uh the two prophets go to israel and they appear and start preaching one god that's what we're going to get into next sunday is where he says where do you get those scars he said in the house of my friends they're going to preach jesus christ so real till that blindness is going to be pulled off their eyes and they're going to say man we missed it that's right he was right there among us and we missed him let's not do the same thing let's stand our feet let's don't do the same thing let's don't miss it because listen god will not blind gentiles like he blinded israel because the fullness the bible says the fullness of time has come in in ephesians the fullness of time is our time that's right we can't plead ignorance that oh no no god blinded my eyes no no you blind yourself you put your own hand and you know what you have no covering for that but see if god does something he said i blinded you so i could get the gentile bride but i'm not going to leave you i made a covenant with you i still love you you didn't get agape love like the like the gentiles did but i'm fixing to give it to you amen so he gives them the agape love let's musicians come because listen like like i said before the only thing that's going to be in heaven is agape love there's not going to be any filial love that's why brother bryan said all the things sex glands all the hugging and all that won't be any problem won't be any problem shouting and rejoicing and praising the lord because there won't be any what carnality there won't be a carnal mind listen what goes into that other dimension didn't come from your mama or your daddy that's right that shell came from your mama and daddy so you can make a choice amen pretty simple but i love this eternal plan of redemption because it includes everybody even the lost but it includes everybody you can either decide to be redeemed or decide to be unredeemed because only the bride can be redeemed the others can never be redeemed because they'll never come to a place to where they see what you and i see let's sing a song god bless your heart remember all these things that we've that we've announced coming up brother aaron will be speaking for us sunday and then i mean the wednesday and then next sunday we'll have our regular sunday school like we have before so let's sing a song god bless you page 3 14. that's just his way of telling me he loves me it's a love beyond all human understanding [Music] that's right of telling me he loves me first verse he he lets me walk down roads of disappoint now oh he watches and he knows what's best for me all the more i've tried the better he can mold me change my life completely that it will fit his perfect will well that's just his way of telling me he loves me it's love beyonce beyond [Music] and i won't question bring me to my knees [Music] should be that way he'll give me strength to climb the highest history my greatest strength comes [Music] and my greatest joy is knowing that he can fully trust in me well that's just his way of telling me he loves me it's a love beyond all human understanding [Music] that's right he loves me listen there's something that god has for each and every one of us you gotta find it he's not gonna come to your door and just lay it out you gotta fight your way through this you gotta struggle but just remember one thing what the world calls wonderful we should call filth but what we call wonderful they kind of shake their head out but we're looking at an eternal plan they're looking at something uh look the other day you know you you read some of the stuff online and it tells you how you know this is going to happen and that's going to happen and this is going to happen then that's going to happen that don't worry me they shouldn't worry you because god said he'd take care of us amen so let's just believe be prayerful watch and remember we're sheep we have to be led we have to be told we have to be led and god is leading us to the right pastor he led us to the right pasture door now we're going to be led to the right pasture because that's where the green grass is at when we eat amen listen settle yourself down [Music] and realize that you're in the right place and i don't mean i'm not saying this physical place you got to decide whether you're in the right place or not and if you believe the bible says if you believe then stand brother donnie read that this morning i believe it was if you believe you've done all stand right where you're at brother brown said if you've done everything you know to do stand around where you at but listen clear all that junk out of the way clear everything out don't have one thing i was telling them this morning when i'm standing here when somebody's being prayed for i really don't pray a prayer of healing or whatever they need you say that's kind of strange no brother branham said you can cause someone not to get their healing you know what he said you can call somebody by your unconfessed sins and your what you're thinking in your mind so you see me standing here and somebody comes to get prayed for i'm really not praying for that person because that person has come to a place that they want to pray with the person standing up here now sure pray that's okay but you better make sure god forgive me of my sins forgive me of my thoughts and let this brother and sister have what they need but don't let it be there's that sin that may be carried forward because you're back there playing on your phone are you back there doing thinking other thoughts or you want to get out of here and you want to leave and this person's they've got three or four in the line and i'm worried where they're really wanting to go home well if you cause any of those people to not get their healing that's on you not them not on the pastor not on the person praying that's on you so i just hold my hand up i say god clear me of everything that that person can get their healing now see that's the way you approach god yes see that is his way because we're going to talk about it next week when you pray believe boy that's hard no it's real simple if i'm going to take my time and pray i'm going to believe what i'm praying for and who i'm praying to how many times brother dale told us when somebody's preaching the word of god's coming forth and you get an unction that that ain't nothing but the truth like hattie said you need to raise your hand and say god my children or god my healing or god my this because god is close when he brings a revelation he's right here he didn't send a second person or a third person and he don't send an angel listen he never sent an angel to william branham to give him a revelation either god came himself and talked to him or the angel said now william branham have you ever read over here in deuteronomy remember what he said he said the angel would give me scriptures he said i'd spend all day searching the scriptures well when there's a revelation comes it's fresh and whether you get that revelation or not god's closer than he he'll be if you're sitting somewhere else you say well no no listen the way the song is that's just his way that's his way of doing things why would a why would god say hey if you get in trouble [Music] find the temple and the bible even says if even if you're in another country if you'll find the way and i bet you i'll promise you every one of those people that believe that knew the direction that temple was in and when they turned to the direction of that temple they were doing they were holding god to his word that god was obligated to get them out of trouble because he said i will get you out of trouble if you will look toward the temple and pray so there's jonah floating around in whale guts and i believe he did this one time [Music] and got about right here and he said there's the temple lord it's dark down here and it stinks get me out of this and god had to honor that and god spat him out right where he was supposed to been not somewhere else he spat him out on the on the very shore of wherever he was supposed to be in the first time so god's going to have his way but if you'll turn we don't have to turn and find a temple you are the temple so you say god you've sent us a prophet you've sent us good preachers you've sent us good elders you've sent us good deacons and all different ones but god you're right here clear myself out of anything that'll keep even in here brother brown said one unconfessed sin can make the church bitterly fail not just fail bitterly fail maybe that's why we're not moving on but you know what confession is good for the soul and your brother michael it's good for you i enjoyed it it makes you feel so much better to just get it out and it don't hurt if it hurts your feelings you really didn't you really didn't ask forgiveness right if it hurts your feelings right because you're saying i really meant what i said but i'm just going to do this for no you better not clean it out brotherly kindness is loving those that hate you amen god bless you let's bow our hands dear lord thank you for this day that you give us thank you for the singing and for the worship and all the thank you lord that you've let allowed us to have the sunday school back together again lord that we can hear from you lord truly we come here to hear from you lord this is the place that you've set aside that we can come lord and
