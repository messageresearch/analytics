========================================

and remember if you ever reference anything that that we teach or taught on we reference the old book but the paragraphs are always the same the page numbers are not the same okay that one's about three pages off because they used either bigger part of smaller formal anything but the paragraph numbers are always yeah well you know what though if you buy a machine and then it got upgraded to we're now in a computer to fit it in so many pages its money really more than anything to keep from having a volume that big now they can condense it to lab they say back to paper so yeah no that's that's Carly goes down to a cost thing everything goes down all right let's turn to Philippians 2 Fennell where we were at we've been so long since we had just I've been down here so let's start good now night and today yes ma'am and congratulate them because she is with child he's gonna have a baby we kiss on the team all right so let's get here to where we're talking now and he's going through the book of Philippians and then when we get done we're gonna start with the Book of Revelations that's what we wanted to do right okay we'll start through the book of Revelation and that may take a while but that's okay do all things let's go to chapter 2 verse 14 with the other here on the board do all the things without murmuring and disputing now what is Paul doing Paul is talking to the people in Philippi are the Philippians and he's exhorting them as Christians that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without review in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation so he was standing there in the midst of a crooked em for first day Ali thank you brought you back pack leader yeah so now among whom you shine as lights in the world so as the eternal word have died hey baby as the eternal Word of God we see that we do the same thing now but you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world so that's you now today I love the eternal quality of the word it can be written 2,000 years ago and still apply directly to us today all right holding forth the word of life yet I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain no once he said he has brought these people to Christ and he has not labored in vain because he's going to be he's going to be connected with as brother branham went across the curtain of time and he was connected with all those people across the current town they said we're resting on that but what brother brown said they came in receiving the new birth and received the message it was put in the sixth dimension so same way with Paul neither labored in vain that's the same way with you know you talk about I don't want to talk about it when you do you talk about people that that like brother Dale in different ones and have been 50 years in the message and you just he still holds fasting still any any any nursers all of us and here the church is growing now numbers don't mean anything but - you got to remember numbers do mean something you know to God God knows the number we don't but to be successful is is that brother Dale brings you to Christ not to him brings use of Christ and then Christ in you commune back and forth but it takes a fivefold ministry in between that to filter all the junk out in vultan you're done I don't know but I filtered our junk out and then turns us to the right path as we were talking last night about why God sent a prophet God sends prophets to watch steer us back to the Word of God not change the word but steer us back to the Word of God right so that's what brother Branham came for his sole purpose was not to get us saved no that's been happening since Christ - right he didn't come tell us how to dress that's already been printed in the Bible for 1500 years he didn't tell us all those things that people thought for 50 years people didn't trying to get us to be legalist right no that's not it roll around for message came to bring us to Christ and if he'll bring you to Christ I said yup that's question for you if he'll bring you to Christ then you'll know where he stood as a prophet and you'll understand that the words he spoke was God's words to us to line us back up only when he called Lucien's the doctrinal issues not the doctrine issues of Herod dreads know what about give them all those things the other had to be brought back but he his message was to bring us to a place of perfection a body change a place to where we don't have to die a place to where this message becomes so alive in you that is just like Jesus Christ walking to the face of the earth and we got to believe that amen we've gotta say I had my father on one okay and we come from God and we'd go back to God remember John 17 Jesus said I pray thee that they may be one as you and I are one so if Jesus and the father were one person we got to connect to that right and that didn't happen down through the ages because what man had took little little tip tidbits a little snippets and they said oh this is this is father son Holy Ghost baptism there is an eternal hell there is a so it took going to bring the property to line back up just like in Paul's day it took a property to bring from the Old Testament so that's all Paul had remember Paul was riding the New Testament he didn't read the New Testament he was riding that he was riding it though from the Old Testament that he took in God what through the filter of the Holy Ghost that was in Paul took the Old Testament running rupaul and then he made the New Testament and as we said last night we're coming up to New Testament in my blood Paul could die Paul died but he didn't die for anybody Jesus Christ died for it something black doctor he died for me I don't know if he died for you but he died for me right now what we're talking about taking the communion last night a question that the kids had yeah and if I'd be offered upon the sacrifice and disturbance of your faith I joy and rejoice with you all for the same cause also do we join and rejoice ye joy and rejoice with me but I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy Shortland to you that may be of no be a good comfort when I know your state Paul wasn't following it Paul worried about the people you want make sure the people knew what he was talking about because he and that's why saying we were in Brenham same way with Jesus Christ he kept saying repeating itself brother Graham kept saying you know these doctrinal issues all the way through that we understand them for I have no man like-minded who will naturally care for your state in other words look for all seek their own not the things which are Jesus Christ Paul knew there was grievious wolves getting ready to come in I've been reading that the book of Acts the Grievous wolves was gonna come in and do what tear his doctrine down just like they're done brother Randall doctor no tearing at them but you know the prison theme that as a son with the father he has served with me and the gospel so much mm same way you know him therefore I hope to send presently so soon as I shall see how it will go with me he's in members and Philip on but I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly to the people again I suppose it necessary to send you to sent you if that frittatas EE PAP Road itís my brother and companion in labor and fellow servant fellow soldier but you mentioned during he that ministered to my ways now this is no remember this is the letter Paul's writing so he's having to write the letter with the content for he longed after you all and was full because that he had heard that he had been sick for indeed he was sitting on to death but God had mercy on him and not on him only but on me also that's not good enough sorrow upon sorrow I sent him there for the more careful that when you see him again you may rejoice too now maybe the less sorrowful receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness and hope suction reputation same way with you another because for the works of Christ he was nine to death not regarding his life to supply your lack of service toward me all right Chapter three finally my brother because I think this is we've got two more chapter finally my brother rejoice in the Lord to write the same things to you to me indeed is not Grievous but for you it is safe I I take these writings of Paul now truthfully there's no way brother man wrote the Bible if you add or take away all right the plagues are there or your like names taken out of the book Paul was commissioned to do that so we have to look and see to write the same things to you brother Branham wrote us eleven hundred sermons our God did through brother Graham brought us eleven hundred sermons for us to study and not turn to the man like most doing something but to turn to God okay cuz that was the voice of God in the in our day just like Paul but now remember Paul's Commission was I run this race I'm coming to the end of my race I have fought a good fight a crown of life was laid up for me he knew he was gonna have to die and I think at some point brother Brown knew he was gonna have to go off the scene because people were look what they were doing they were baptizing in his name they were saying he was God and I promise you one thing God's not gonna share the glory with nobody not even William Branham I'm gonna share his glory but now when William Branham doing it it was the people around him same way with Paul I remember in acts Paul and Barnabas Barnabas went to Mars healed or something I believe it was and they were preaching in the power God was there and they called him Jupiter and some Greek guys you know because they were doing such great exploits well now that's not ice exactly what happened in the end time you know they made brother Brennan with God because of the things he does but Paul rebuked him and told him no that's not what happened he was just a like-minded just like you he's not Grievous but to you it is safe beware of dogs that doesn't mean puppies it doesn't mean Rottweilers and Bulldogs that means that Rottweilers and Bulldogs called demons right be aware of evil workers beware of the concision in that word means mutilation about that well you know what that's what's happening now people are mutilating the message they're cutting the peen cutting the pieces cutting it apart yeah and look they're not burning bugs turn on cutting books up they're cutting people to the soul they're cutting the soul of the people up and of course I just want to make this one statement if you're not grounded in God you'll be cut up uncle if you're not you act you will be you will be deceived because the elect cannot be deceived but everyone else will be saved all right so just make sure the elect your delay but we are the circumcision I'm not talking about physical which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh though I might also have confidence in the flesh hmm if any other man think that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh I'm more watch why what's he saying circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin don't over Paula from commitment absolutely tells you right now Hebrew the Hebrews as touching the law a Pharisee what's this concerning zeal persecuting the church to me that's a great a great God that knows how to use somebody because here's Paul Paul was the greatest persecutor of the church there ever was in the beginning no one had the zeal to try to destroy Christians as Paul did or so this all goes down on the road and God strikes him down and you know the story now I wouldn't Paul's conversion that's what we're going about last night you think boy that was Paul's conversion no that went Paul's conversion Paul get knocked off the horse because God told him they led him to the city but life had to come from the body from an eyes and the gun appears damn nice and said you need to go down there and and and I'm sure how nice was like Lord he said the Bible is the Lord that's all you want me to go ahead and lay hands on him he's been laying hands on us but it ain't been good Lord says remember that he had damned I said and the Lord said he's my chosen vessel but you've got to go lay hands on me to get him scaled up his eyes and to receive the baptism of the Holy or save the whole adopted group Damascus he just got knocked off his horse he just got turned in the right direction where he could see God because he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees his life was perfect mm-hmm concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless but what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ so all that three two persons that flew there Paul counted them as he's standing in another scripture dumb okay yay doubtless then I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung there we are that I may win Christ networth there's rubbish or when we say done we know what that means then I may win Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness because verse 5 6 and 7 he was filling the Seldon I'm not really but he was telling you that if anybody's righteous I'm righteous be anybody's perfect I'm perfect according to the law that's what we see in the Maxie for them because everybody goes through that well I've never cut my hair of never cut you know I'm never I've never like I always said about the laundry list you got that laundry list up on them refrigerator I've never I've done that don't mean nothing pulses it's dumb water doesn't throwing trash cans till he does you no good how many times do we sing and we were talking yesterday so called what we think grounded and settled message girls what's the first thing they do you know they don't have the baptism all the DOS I gonna cut their hair and they're gonna wear pants they're gonna put oh my god hmm so the title message girl is they're real loose from you that weren't here yesterday one of the questions was why are worthy girls more friendly to you the message girl well number one I said well probably because if she's a real true message girl which there is no you either born again or not if you're living a hound dog life she ain't gonna pay attention to you anyway a worldly girls got another intention she's gonna be friendly to you because she has other intentions but message girls to reach out you know do things know better stay out of my life girl you don't problem that window crisp yes she reach out in the spirit of christ and not be like I'm better than you you don't talk about yeah but when you got a worldly got hound in here well that wasn't a question the question was girl oh yeah it was written by a guy okay I know that yeah but it was a guy call they said dating I hope it ain't a girl yeah it's all contactor what's going on here and let me make sure that we understand this on the internet it's it was a question that was asked about date could pretense was is I want to date worthy girls because they're more friendly than message girls and I do the message in quotation because there is no such thing as a messy girl you're either born again you're not you're on the world of God lunatic so so that was the whole thing was his can I date men of worldly girls would it be okay I think the question is part of that was is it okay right a little bang Kalyan you know she's way back in a bad box here eyebrows jewel above her glasses so but you know we've seen this that's why we're trying to get the young people to see that we've already seen this years and years of going to youth camps and seeing the same people have the same issues and then they go to the altar and that crime they spit and they spew and everything else you understand what I'm saying bro ground means it's not you know they snot all over the place and then the next year you see them or the next year you don't see them at all because they're gone right so you get a real birth let's put them grounded in the Word of God and and they were valid questions that they asked I mean that was a valid question we're going to cover it more in depth the next use Bible study because I want people to realize no you should not date worldly girls you'll get yourself in real trouble but if you're not a born-again believer you're going to date horribly girls because there's nothing in you to hold you you got to have the new birth to hold you and then you can sure you can witness to anybody but remember brother Rousey you don't go out there I thought it was a girl no I said dating but no you don't go out there see brother hamster don't you say okay I'll go to church with you to about detergent and you come with me to messenger if he said don't do that he said you be salty and let him come to you because if you go out there guess where you're going you're going out there hmm all right so you stay right here and say hey buddy you want to date me we come to church you want to you want to date I promise you three days a week 10 o'clock two o'clock Sunday instead one o'clock Wednesday afternoon you want to date me those are prepaid you'll get me three times you know but it's gonna be in the church environment because if you don't if you step out and we've all done it okay so we walk we're not all so sheltered that's why I say I don't like message girls I bet this I mean you put a picture up and what's the message girl look like you put the picture up but but what the devil does excuse me if he's not born again the devil just takes that outside line and he goes and she's got on a pair of pants she should cut her hair she's wearing makeup behind that he understand behind that he pulls the real veil off and there's the person standing there because you know as well as I do we've seen people that we've tried to beat into it you can't you just got to be salty you got to show them because they're watching you they're watching every move you make you tell divaldo a girl like the laundry that you know growing up and something has has really been made real to me is that sometimes when you are born are you we grew up in a message home department yeah sometimes that can be what like it's like I'm a better word and in a head of it you know because it's hard when you grow up not drinking not committing adultery not then it's hard earth to know cuz it you know you take for example a nunnery we look at the Catholic Church they put people in nunneries and they've got popes over I mean priest over there don't have wives and you see what's happened they become pedophile and they become prostitutes because they are so put into a sheltered environment but I don't want if I had a daughter I wasn't going to say alright nine for about two years you need to go out there and word on and see what's going on and then I know you'll be back well be careful be careful but you know what after they get a certain age and they get going out they gonna do it anyway they go find town I promise you good idea fraida did nothing you'll do you know Caitlin I don't know she still got that little halo on cuff her remember yesterday it was a problem that works what it is joining you don't know everything in the world right you don't have any God don't have grandchildren yeah yes son the daughter is there's so many people that's not freaked in the truth I mean I grew up in an environment sometimes that can be well you resent it because it's bounded in your so much and that's the way it was all of the source so nice you can say look it was pounded but it's yeah because though when you turn 18 who got married or went out in the world I mean mean you both all we all didn't we got over them me and Jim got married at 19 and 18 and we go coming to church just we didn't have an answer but we went you know because of our parents or whoever you know but that's why we tried to it this church we try to preach the Word of God let the Word of God do it not emotions not feelings not somebody's a cramming it down the throat had it done many times you know but like dad was talking about last night you take legalism I meant to mention last night most legalist that we're in this message I thought had adulterous issues though he's talking about you know people that talk legalism by the time their life come up in the later years you found out that they divorced their wife and made another girl and then they had this one and then they was doing this most of your legal is your pure legal expecially the ones that came from out there in this one state start with a name but look look at your life you look at the people's life when you come to the end of the road you look back and see that's what legalism did it turns you into free love that's what brother it turns that into free love it's hard to understand it's really a paradox because you think boy they don't yeah I want you to be a chaste virgin well you pound so much legalism in somebody well look Pope's are not supposed to have lines right it's well-known that five to six Pope's back in the back in the history of popes had women they weren't wives they were concubines and they had kids so the Pope had young uns see that's against everything that you hold or the world holds up the Pope to be so pure listen we're all human beings we're put on this earth for a purpose and that's the worship God but we have are allowed to live and that's why I think that the Catholic Church would be wrong when they told the priests they couldn't have no why because you're burning your own lust then they start messing with these boys now that ain't God but that's legalism every day you don't do all your that's what Paul was trying to tell everybody in the Old Testament it was wash the pie put it right here on a certain day of the year you know put your menorah here and light it certain times Paul was trying to say last night the tradition that we're we're trying to get away from that tradition and be found in him who Christ not in the law but be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law that's that laundry list I didn't do this I didn't do that I didn't do this or I don't do this I don't do that at all to this all right good listen folks without the new verb you will do one of those on that laundry list it's not three or four or five or six somewhere down the line and he's proving itself mount the anointed ones can go so far but it when it comes to living the Word of God the true Word of God they fall they find one little thing to get off of they find one little like Paul talks about grievious wolves and people that are coming in and and disrupting the Word of God listen I've told y'all for years the Baptist Earth do not care about the message they have their own thing the that this have their own thing now once once before Pentecost was kind of interlaced with the message down there over here so we're singular in ourselves and our greatest my greatest fear was is what apostasy from inside not apostasy from out there they're not gonna yeah I've got trouble us why and here we go again buster over here being a bad mr. na he's a little higher than baby's probably closer to kind of comfortable brother Buster are over here would do anything in the world to help us anything where a message brothers that don't agree with you and doctrine would rather see you guts burn literally right so show me you love God you understand what I mean but see anointed ones is it's just so much of a blanket now to where everybody's religious everybody can do this isn't it all right I mean you really it is yeah it's just the Word of God and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the only thing that's gonna get us out of here that's it nothing else no longer let us know how long your dresses are no no that ain't it we wasted a lot of time all those years when we should have been digging into the Word of God so they would get to baby born and then they'd beat it to death there was numerous don't tell me don't don't no don't get me wrong there was new birth in all that but you got the baby it's like Caitlyn's gonna have a baby in several modern unless you know I hate much from now whatever it isn't all this she's gonna get the baby and we're all gonna go baby's here she's gonna thank God the baby's here you know and then they're gonna just take it and put it in the room of their house and shut the door and go well now that baby's in there and he's alive he Charlie Charlie's in there and he's alive we'll go back and check in in three months now that's the way the people in the message have been brought up we got the baby here we got the hair the grass well it may not have any hair we got some hair we got the grasp right we dress the baby we put it in the crib we put him a brand new Doc room but we're gonna go back to check on him in three months no debate he's gonna die and that's what happens babies have died in this magazine under didn't some don't some book Realty it's just always been the Word of God the Word of God is gonna do it okay where nothing else will stand the word of the understand you said well that is part of the Word of God you're right it's part if not all of it that's right you got to grow up you got to become a teenager you got them coming a dog you got to become a mat or Christian that's why we're still here floats I'm telling you that's why we're still here because we have the power brother after you got enough Holy Ghost in you to create a world and go live on and you do but a bar is holding it what bar you your what's holding it back because if God releases that power to you if we're not characterized by God we don't have that character first time somebody cut you off the highway you know kill that man you say it doesn't work look at Elijah Elijah had the power of God on him not in him but own him just like an anointed one because if a man is told he wouldn't kill him you and the columns the she-bears to eat the children but because him being a prophet God had to honor what he said and quickly he turned without character without character I'm sorry he didn't have believer so we didn't have any of these characteristics he turned curse the 42 children they died that's what you would do your boss you know your this and your head you name all these people that you want to get rid of well God's not gonna release that power until you're able to forgive them forgive them all not worry about what they've done to you Jesus Christ on the cross not worrying about what people don't do amen so that's what you have to do but I may know him what you know like this then I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead now see there's a lot of people will cover this just real quick then we'll go upstairs come on stop right there there come on this scripture right here if you look back in the history the people that were around Paul was preaching that the resurrection was gonna happen during Paul's time because he said that right there that I may attain unto the resurrection of the Dead Paul had to come back later on in another letter and because brother Graham covers this that everybody thought the resurrection was gonna have your palms a Paul says no no no wait a minute there's got to be this great falling away like Chris was in Galatians it's got to be this the resurrection is not gonna happen nearby huh it's going to happen at a later time but he let's see when he preached this other people took it and said well Paul's preaching into resurrection is coming right now see how good he'll misconstrued you can be if you don't have the Holy Ghost you'll be messed up when you see that and what is he talking about he's talking about an out resurrection in other words he was resurrected from the dead when he got the new birth you and I are a resurrected that's why we don't have to die again we'll never die again we may fall asleep but we'll never die you died when you receive the new birth your data your daddy Christ the dead in Christ shall rise first okay so that's what Paul's telling right here he's saying hey then I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead and then people took it one time with your brother Brendan where do they get their false doctrines from in the message they gave you from the message you know open your Bible we know there's only one gun we know water baptism the name Lord Jesus cross we know there's no eternal hell we know all these major doctrines well the guy down the road in the Methodist Church he opened the same Bible preachers of Trinity preachers Warner baptismal name Father Holyoke uses the same Bible they don't change it it changed the revelation interpretation so the interpretation they got wrong but Paul's telling them later on in another epistle he says look we got to look for we got to look for a resurrection of this guy resurrect is sitting in heavenly places this guy not the physical guy but the physical guys are going to come up in a resurrection but it's not gonna happen right now but now listen it is now this is the time of the resurrection this is the resurrection message the Son of Man is the resurrection message because only the Son of Man resurrected amen so if we're under the Sun oh man ministry that's why everybody keeps hollering son of man son of man they don't know what they're talking about it's a resurrection message we got to get the dead Saints out of the ground first then we're changed then we go in the rapture there's a process so we have to preach the Son of man message so much as Jesus did when he said Lazarus come forth but it won't just be Lazarus this time with me everybody let's go do you ever watch okay all right let's go [Music] [Music]
