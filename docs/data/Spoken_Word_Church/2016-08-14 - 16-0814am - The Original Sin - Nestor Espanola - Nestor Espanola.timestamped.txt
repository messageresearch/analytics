[31:11] linger in the Throne of God Amen praise
[31:15] God so help us in
[31:17] prayer praise God hallelujah
[31:21] so next so this is what's happening so
[31:26] this is what we always do in in uh uh
[31:28] doing um um seminar with the Laos
[31:32] Minister Laos is a very strict communist
[31:35] they are still poor country you know
[31:37] when China is still poor when you know
[31:40] we know it communism they hate religion
[31:43] any kinds of religion see we know the
[31:46] fism naism but it is only that one ISM
[31:49] that really hate
[31:51] religion and that is communism to them
[31:54] com uh religion is poison see praise God
[31:59] so uh when China is still poor they are
[32:02] very strict but when their economy went
[32:04] up they become a little bit lenient so
[32:06] same thing with Vietnam when they are
[32:09] still very poor but now their economy is
[32:11] rising up and then Laos is still a very
[32:15] poor country see if I will go there they
[32:18] won't even allow me to stand behind the
[32:20] pulpit see even just to greet the people
[32:24] no Foreigner is allow right see so
[32:27] what's the use of going in there praise
[32:30] God one time we do Bible study in Laos
[32:33] you know one first day you you have no
[32:35] problem see but the SEC first day when
[32:38] the neighbors saw there's so many people
[32:40] going into that house see they may they
[32:43] might say oh maybe they have some
[32:45] occasion but if you do it on the second
[32:48] day then the neighbor is obligated see
[32:51] to report you to report it into the
[32:53] security to the police and then now in
[32:57] the third day you better run fast see so
[33:01] you I cannot accomplish many things you
[33:04] know doing that so that's why I try to
[33:07] invite them and uh go into into the
[33:10] border of Thailand I will show it to you
[33:13] later praise God so there is where we
[33:16] have our seminar for uh 3 days see and
[33:21] we book in a hotel next see praise God
[33:26] next see so that's how we do it it's in
[33:29] in in one of the hotels room okay we
[33:33] cannot use the same hotel at the uh more
[33:36] than three times we keep on jumping M
[33:39] see because the you know they are also
[33:43] being followed being monitored see it's
[33:46] a little bit expensive because if you're
[33:49] talking about 10 ministers to inviting
[33:51] them to come out of their country praise
[33:54] God see just paying for their VIs
[33:57] $30 each if you if you have 10 you're
[34:00] talking about 300 see praise God just
[34:05] paying the Visa then they need to travel
[34:07] you know praise God so if you're talking
[34:10] about $40 each then you have already 400
[34:14] see that's already 700 see so these are
[34:18] poor Minister remember praise God I came
[34:20] from a poor country I know it see if you
[34:23] invite them for 3 Days imagine for 3
[34:26] days you know they work a day and eat a
[34:28] day yeah see praise God I hope you
[34:32] understand it this our Minister we we
[34:35] are not happy just to send them okay you
[34:37] go home I give you the word see yeah
[34:39] they also have a
[34:41] stomach they also need to eat that's
[34:43] right see praise God whatever left I
[34:46] give it to them so I easily spend $8,000
[34:50] I'm just trying to share it to you so
[34:52] you will understand because we need more
[34:54] ministers to go there praise God
[34:57] [Laughter]
[34:58] so you know how
[35:02] much see praise God then you need to
[35:05] book the hotel praise God then you need
[35:08] to feed them for 3 days but look when
[35:12] there are 10 mins coming out you are
[35:14] talking about six churches at least six
[35:16] churches you're dealing with six
[35:18] churches praise God and you have three
[35:20] days Bible study and in the 3 days
[35:23] sometimes we can have a uh in the first
[35:26] day we have two service and the uh
[35:27] second day we have three or four service
[35:30] and then on the third day you know they
[35:32] need to go back home because that's the
[35:34] only see we we have at least six to
[35:38] seven meeting see and here praise God
[35:41] dear brother Craig Boer from Al Lima
[35:44] Ohio praise God I ask him to come
[35:46] because I'm getting
[35:49] old see we need we need we need the the
[35:52] the mission field to go on okay praise
[35:55] God here uh we have this question and
[35:58] answer praise God after the service
[36:00] that's better you know you can because
[36:03] it is no use to go into that country and
[36:06] and and and uh you know preach in their
[36:09] church when the past even when even the
[36:12] pastor don't understand what the message
[36:14] is so it's better to share the gospel to
[36:18] this message to the pastor first and now
[36:20] we keep on baptizing and these ministers
[36:23] that's coming from Laos I tell you they
[36:25] accepted the says they were baptized in
[36:27] the message and they are being
[36:29] persecuted because of the message see
[36:33] one brother he was kicked out of the
[36:34] church I think I tell you that is uh
[36:37] testimony when I was here before praise
[36:40] God see he was kicked out of the church
[36:42] he was also kick out of the village just
[36:45] is standing for this message praise God
[36:48] and the problem we cannot build Church
[36:49] in Laos I don't know what will happen
[36:52] because uh they are too strict see but
[36:55] we have many ministers now they keep on
[36:58] uh preaching this uh uh message you know
[37:02] keep on re baptizing people that's why
[37:05] even this denomination evang Laos
[37:07] Evangelical Church they were uh uh how
[37:11] do you say shaken or they were now
[37:13] afraid of them because people they keep
[37:16] on baptizing you know but they cannot
[37:18] stop them people are asking why what's
[37:22] the problem they are only sharing the
[37:24] Bible see praise God so so keep them in
[37:29] prayer okay next praise God H Allelujah
[37:32] so this is where we are working praise
[37:35] God that is the United States so praise
[37:39] God this is uh this is the southeast
[37:41] Asia Next see so this is the next
[37:44] southeast Asia so this is where I'm
[37:47] working Burma Laos Thailand Cambodia
[37:52] Vietnam see so if you will notice
[37:55] Cambodia see is this is very strategic
[37:58] because a four country is connected with
[38:01] this with this uh uh with this country
[38:05] so Vietnam we have the message in
[38:07] Vietnam for so long but they still
[38:10] praise God I can say very very weak okay
[38:14] praise God and here we Danny is now
[38:18] working in this area brother Danny
[38:20] delmundo because uh you know he's
[38:23] working now in in Myanmar and also in in
[38:26] in Japan and this is the Philippines
[38:29] praise God see
[38:31] next praise God so this is Thailand this
[38:34] is Laos next so this is Ching Rai this
[38:38] is where I I took the ministers to go
[38:40] out to come out see it's in the in the
[38:43] boundary of Thailand Thailand is a free
[38:45] country you can do what you want to do
[38:48] praise God so it's better you know
[38:51] praise God see we can have a service for
[38:53] the whole day as long as you want praise
[38:56] God there is no problem with them praise
[38:58] God see next next so this is Vietnam so
[39:04] this is Thailand this is Laos so this is
[39:06] where we we meet the Laos ministers so
[39:09] the Vietnam also the Vietnamese
[39:11] ministers next so this is Cambodia this
[39:15] is Vietnam Next
[39:18] see so this is the where we meet the
[39:21] Laos ministers next so this is the
[39:24] Vietnamese ministers we I also to gather
[39:27] them in Cambodia because Vietnam is also
[39:30] a communist country though they are a
[39:32] little bit lenient but I do not want to
[39:34] take a chance that's right okay praise
[39:37] God see it's better to save God's
[39:40] servant right than save the money see
[39:44] you can earn the money but I don't know
[39:46] what will happen to me if I got caught
[39:48] in Vietnam see they uh several Minister
[39:52] message minister they were being they
[39:54] got caught you know even uh Ron Peterson
[39:57] and several other from New Zealand and
[39:59] they were arrested and you know the
[40:02] Vietnamese people the Vietnamese
[40:04] government they will not uh they will
[40:06] not kill you they just want the money
[40:08] yeah see if I got arrested they will
[40:11] they are they will ask 10,000 us yeah
[40:15] see what will happen to
[40:18] me I have eight
[40:21] children see I don't want to you know
[40:25] see if if I take them out here yeah we
[40:28] spend more see we spend around 2 to
[40:31] 3,000 us see because a lot of them will
[40:34] come you know this Vietnam is a big
[40:36] country look praise God see if you if
[40:39] you are talking about 20 to 25 ministers
[40:42] to come out praise God you're you you
[40:46] talking about sometimes uh some of them
[40:48] will travel from here to come here it
[40:50] will cost them $100 right see praise God
[40:54] so it's a little bit expensive like like
[40:56] I say it's a little bit expensive praise
[40:59] God see but to me um we can accomplish
[41:02] more if we deal with the minister see
[41:06] praise God but today you know yes sir uh
[41:09] this this is a little bit expensive see
[41:13] compared to Laos see that's why now what
[41:16] I am trying to do I will just go go here
[41:19] in Danang somewhere here see praise God
[41:24] and there is a there is a
[41:27] Christian
[41:29] Hotel see praise God so I we've been
[41:33] doing this for almost 3 years you know
[41:35] for the Vietnamese believer see uh what
[41:38] happened when I when we went there uh
[41:41] they keep on translating the message but
[41:43] they don't have the books I said how can
[41:45] you study without the books he said oh
[41:48] we uh we can listen to the message I
[41:51] said my goodness there is no no school
[41:53] still that were uh that were in invented
[41:56] that the people can can learn just by
[42:00] listening okay there is no such school
[42:03] yet okay praise God Amen see so I we try
[42:07] to print the books see uh some before
[42:11] the brother from New Zealand they're
[42:12] helping but then uh the economy
[42:15] something happened to the Pacific island
[42:17] now the brother from Canada uh brother
[42:20] Eugene Brown see they are sending uh we
[42:24] can only print books to books four books
[42:28] in a quarter see before we can print
[42:31] four books in one month but today it
[42:34] down to four books in three months see
[42:37] so you see the shortage you know praise
[42:40] God see so now this is what's happening
[42:44] see next praise God see so maybe next
[42:49] time praise God when I go there I will
[42:52] just deal for five Minister because we
[42:54] are doing it for almost three years is
[42:56] spending a lot of money see so I talk to
[42:59] brother the brother IND Danang 111
[43:02] ministers there when I went there last
[43:04] time I cannot even go to the church see
[43:08] the pastor even even he they even want
[43:11] me to preach he said brother Nestor this
[43:14] place our place is very small see and
[43:19] all of us are being monitored if you
[43:21] come to the church everybody will be in
[43:23] trouble right and I don't want to do it
[43:26] so when I went there we just have the
[43:28] lunch and then they said and one brother
[43:31] said the place that you're staying is a
[43:34] Christian you know the owner is a
[43:36] Christian you can do the seminar there I
[43:38] said okay next time that is I think that
[43:41] is what we need to do because that
[43:43] Pastor told me you know he said you know
[43:46] brother Nestor I've been in the me I
[43:48] hear this message for so long more than
[43:50] 10 years but when you hold that seminar
[43:53] in in in Cambodia that really make it
[43:56] clearer to me okay so when I went to
[43:59] China I just want to give you a
[44:00] testimony you know how see the Chinese
[44:04] people they are very industrious they
[44:06] will read the message when they read
[44:08] this the seven Church ages they read it
[44:10] seven times M see they they can almost
[44:14] memorize it yeah because they thought
[44:17] reading it so many times will make them
[44:20] understand but they cannot understand
[44:22] right see when I went there for two days
[44:25] see they put me in hotel they book me
[44:28] there you know so they come one by one
[44:31] one by one then sit there praise God
[44:33] when they are when they all gathered
[44:35] together I will go out of my room they
[44:37] they they they book A A big one you a
[44:40] sweet you know praise God so they can
[44:42] gather outside the uh outside the room
[44:44] my room see I start sharing it to them
[44:47] the seven Church ages the the
[44:50] Catholicism you know and just for 2 days
[44:53] they they were say why
[44:56] it's so easy to understand right see
[45:00] praise God like I say you know we need
[45:02] the fivefold ministry praise God if the
[45:06] mission work is uh printing the books
[45:09] making the
[45:10] tapes and this if that is the mission
[45:13] work then we need just to find the rich
[45:16] people brother see don't don't need to
[45:19] send this uh five full ministry right
[45:22] praise God just look for a rich people
[45:24] and print the books and you know those
[45:27] were tools okay I'm not against it I
[45:29] need it those were the tools but we need
[45:32] the fivefold ministry amen praise God
[45:35] even in the in the Old Testament
[45:37] remember Philips in the unic see that
[45:40] unic he was a smart man say he keep on
[45:43] reading the Bible you know during that
[45:45] time those the only only person that can
[45:47] read the Bible is those who are educated
[45:50] right see praise God but he cannot
[45:54] understand he said how can I understand
[45:55] when nobody explaining it amen amen and
[45:58] God sent this uh nobody to him to sh to
[46:03] show it to him so same thing praise God
[46:06] hallelujah see so this brother when he
[46:08] told me you know brother Nestor uh it
[46:11] become clear to me it touched my heart
[46:14] see because I do not want to do the
[46:17] seminar anymore because I told them I've
[46:19] been doing it for so long you know and
[46:21] too much money okay praise God too much
[46:24] money is is is is involved praise God
[46:29] see and uh you know okay BCF help a lot
[46:34] okay but you know the problem praise God
[46:36] their mission fund went down praise God
[46:39] see so I that's why I'm trying um you
[46:42] know other church I tell I'm inviting
[46:45] these young ministers
[46:47] also join the field join the field you
[46:50] know praise God I can do so much
[46:53] everybody can do so much like brother
[46:55] Dale said you know Sam said you know we
[46:57] can do we can do this much this brother
[47:00] can do this much praise God I I can only
[47:03] tell you I did my part okay praise God
[47:07] see so next time I said maybe uh we will
[47:10] I I will do the same thing like I do
[47:12] here praise God see so next Allelujah
[47:17] see just uh inviting five five or six
[47:19] ministers so it will be it a little bit
[47:22] cheaper see so this is how we do the
[47:24] seminar next
[47:26] praise God see so this is this is in
[47:29] Cambodia okay next these are CH uh these
[47:32] are Vietnamese and this is the Cambodian

[47:48] message book at the same time when we
[47:49] try to gather this Minister praise God
[47:52] see
[47:53] next Allelujah so this this is you know

[47:58] they have in a big folder mhm see I said
[48:04] no I love the message amen it to me that
[48:08] is the most precious treasure on Earth
[48:11] that God gave to the bride amen see
[48:14] praise God we need to do it right right
[48:16] we need to do it make it very uh you

[48:30] it oh they they they will going to have

[52:23] don't know if I can still go out after 5
[52:26] years okay praise God see so he he came
[52:29] with me last time praise God and
[52:33] everybody was blessed next praise God
[52:36] see so this is the book that we store in
[52:38] this Mission House praise God see that
[52:40] is the pastor this is the Evangelist you
[52:43] know they are all young that's why I've
[52:45] been telling you to the people just give
[52:47] them five more years you you there will
[52:50] come out a very strong Church in
[52:53] Cambodia we need one more model Church
[52:56] in Southeast Asia so I show you Vietnam
[52:59] Thailand Laos Cambodia then Myanmar but
[53:04] there is no model Church in that in that
[53:07] place see praise God I'm praying now
[53:10] there are five of them see all of them
[53:13] are young people and one sister and now
[53:16] next month two are coming praise God
[53:19] next praise God see so this is Cambodia
[53:23] this is the capital next praise God next
[53:27] see so now praise God we went we went to
[53:31] the churches now see the first place
[53:33] that we went is Kong Chang
[53:36] next see so this is this this man he is
[53:41] a pastor of denominational church he is
[53:44] the pastor in this church
[53:46] next see so this is the brother that
[53:50] accepted the message he was re baptized
[53:52] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:54] that Pastor is trying to that Pastor is
[53:57] trying to invite him and giving him the
[54:00] position of the associate pastor see
[54:03] because he got more people than this
[54:06] pastor but he does not want to join him
[54:09] see he said see when we went to his
[54:12] place
[54:14] next next so so this is the pastor next
[54:18] this is his house under underneath it
[54:21] next see this is where they hold the
[54:24] fellowship
[54:25] see praise God so the pastor is inviting
[54:28] him to join them and giving him the
[54:31] position of the associate pastor he said
[54:33] I cannot accept him I cannot accept it
[54:36] because if he will accept it he will be
[54:39] caged right yeah see he knows it he will
[54:42] I will be CAG you know I will see
[54:45] because every time you share the gospel
[54:48] he Shar the message to the church see
[54:51] the pastor keep on raising his hand
[54:53] trying to stop him see that's why he
[54:56] said I don't feel good pastor see so now
[54:59] when he said that praise God what are we
[55:03] going to do that is the next question
[55:05] what are we going to do are we just
[55:08] going to sit there and let this bride

[1:10:31] amen can we all stand up and read the
[1:10:41] scripture
[1:10:43] amen so we know this this is the
[1:10:45] original scene say I want to tackle the
[1:10:48] mystery in the Garden of Eden and the
[1:10:50] Mystery in the ark praise God see this
[1:10:53] is how one of the major doctrines in the
[1:10:55] message amen praise God next praise God
[1:10:59] so just follow me brother praise God you
[1:11:02] can see the scripture there I I will
[1:11:04] just read it into my laptop and just
[1:11:06] follow me and just keep on changing this
[1:11:08] light amen so another Parable put he
[1:11:11] forth unto them saying the Kingdom of
[1:11:13] Heaven is liken and to a man which saw
[1:11:15] good seed in his field but while man
[1:11:18] sleep his enemy his enemy came and saw
[1:11:21] tears right among the wheat
[1:11:24] and went his way but when the blade was
[1:11:26] sprung up and brought for fruit then
[1:11:29] appeared the tears
[1:11:31] also 27 so the Servants of the
[1:11:34] householder came and said unto him sir
[1:11:38] did not thou so good seed in thy field
[1:11:40] where Dan then had it tears he said unto
[1:11:44] me an enemy had done this the servant
[1:11:47] said unto him will thou then that we go
[1:11:50] and gather them
[1:11:52] up but he said nay lest while ye gather
[1:11:56] up the tears ye root up also the wheat
[1:11:59] with them let them both grow together
[1:12:02] until the Harvest and in the time of
[1:12:04] harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather
[1:12:07] ye together first the tears and bind
[1:12:09] them and bonders them to burn them but
[1:12:12] gather the weed into my burn into my
[1:12:14] barn see may the Lord add the blessing
[1:12:17] from the reading of his scripture you
[1:12:19] all may be seated praise God see
[1:12:24] Hallelujah keep going see now the
[1:12:28] parable see now Jesus is trying to
[1:12:32] explain to them the parable here in
[1:12:34] verse 36 then Jesus sent the multitude
[1:12:37] away and went into the house and his
[1:12:39] disciples came unto him saying declare
[1:12:41] unto us the parable of the tears of the
[1:12:43] field he answered and said unto them
[1:12:46] that he that swe the good seed is the
[1:12:49] son of man amen amen
[1:12:51] see the f is the the world yep the good
[1:12:54] seed are the children of the Kingdom but
[1:12:57] the tears are the children of the wicked
[1:12:58] one the enemy that sth them is the devil
[1:13:02] the Harvest is the end of the world and
[1:13:04] the reapers are the angels as therefore
[1:13:08] the tears are gathered and burn in the
[1:13:10] fire so shall it be in the end of the
[1:13:13] world the son of man shall send forth
[1:13:15] his Angel and they Shall Gather out of
[1:13:18] his kingdom all things that offend and
[1:13:21] them which do iniquity and shall cast
[1:13:23] them into the furnace of fire where
[1:13:26] where there there shall be wailing and
[1:13:28] ning of teeth then shall the righteous
[1:13:30] shine forth as a son in the Kingdom of
[1:13:32] the father who had ears to hear Let Him
[1:13:35] hear see so every time Jesus give a
[1:13:38] parable he also explain the parable see
[1:13:42] sometimes praise God people you know we
[1:13:45] just read it we just we just read it
[1:13:47] like passing by you know but then here's
[1:13:50] come the minister that's why there is
[1:13:52] nothing new what on what we are trying
[1:13:55] to teach it's always there amen it's
[1:13:58] always there praise God see Hallelujah
[1:14:02] you know the prophet
[1:14:04] said sometimes you teach this subject it
[1:14:06] will just go on on the head over the
[1:14:09] head of the of the listener see the next
[1:14:12] time it will hit the head the next time
[1:14:14] it will hit the heart see amen praise
[1:14:17] God see maybe it is uh it will just uh
[1:14:21] you know Brother Sam and brother way you
[1:14:23] know they are a good teacher okay praise
[1:14:26] God remember we do believe in the
[1:14:27] fivefold ministry they can do they can
[1:14:30] do such thing I can do this thing you
[1:14:33] know don't try to look from me what your
[1:14:35] pastor has okay and then and don't try
[1:14:37] to look at your pastor what I have Okay
[1:14:41] then if I say something different from
[1:14:42] your pastor charge it to my ignorance
[1:14:46] okay praise God listen and follow your
[1:14:48] pastor praise God hallelujah see
[1:14:52] remember
[1:14:53] praise God see if you if if you saw that
[1:14:57] your pastor is a man of God you need to
[1:14:59] respect him we need to respect him okay
[1:15:02] praise God pray for him praise God
[1:15:05] hallelujah see praise God see so if you
[1:15:09] have some question don't approach me
[1:15:12] talk to your pastor okay and and listen
[1:15:15] to him amen praise God I believe you
[1:15:18] know I believe you have a good pastor
[1:15:20] praise God see so sometimes you know uh
[1:15:25] like the prophet said sometimes there is
[1:15:27] a big man that can see in the hole but
[1:15:29] he can carry the small man and the small
[1:15:31] man can look over the fence okay praise
[1:15:35] God that's all we want to do praise God
[1:15:38] see sometimes when when when people are
[1:15:40] describing one place they can only see
[1:15:42] the this side some can see this side
[1:15:45] some can see the other side but if you
[1:15:47] will try to connect everything then you
[1:15:49] can you can see the whole view of the
[1:15:51] house amen right praise God see so the
[1:15:55] original sin next praise God this is the
[1:15:59] mystery in the Garden of Eden see praise
[1:16:01] God see we need to know it because
[1:16:04] everything came out from the book of
[1:16:06] Genesis all the problem started in the
[1:16:09] Book of Genesis see you know that's why
[1:16:12] the prophet said there are two books
[1:16:14] that the de that the devil does not want
[1:16:16] you to understand the Book of Genesis
[1:16:19] and the Book of Revelation see praise
[1:16:22] God see he wants you to talk about in
[1:16:25] the middle of the Bible see but the but
[1:16:29] the the the the Genesis and Revelation
[1:16:31] he does not want you to understand it
[1:16:33] that's right amen okay praise God see
[1:16:36] Hallelujah now next so this is what the
[1:16:40] the the terms from the Matthew there is

[1:16:45] field there the Harvest Time and the
[1:16:47] Reapers see it said praise God there is
[1:16:51] the owner who saw yeah see the owner see
[1:16:56] he saw seeds and it's a wit seed praise
[1:17:01] God on the field while he slept another
[1:17:04] come in the enemy it says the enemy he
[1:17:08] saw another tear another seed and that
[1:17:10] is the tears praise God then Jesus said
[1:17:13] you know the owner that is the son of
[1:17:15] man that is the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:17:17] is the Lord God Amen praise God and the
[1:17:19] enemy none other is said than the devil

[1:17:25] children of the kingdom and the tears
[1:17:28] they are the children of the wicked one
[1:17:30] see so if you will notice praise God see
[1:17:34] there are two kinds of people on this
[1:17:37] earth right one is a children of God one
[1:17:40] is the children of the devil see whether
[1:17:42] you believe it or not praise God see
[1:17:45] even the scripture said it next praise
[1:17:48] God he says here in John 3:10 in this
[1:17:52] that children of God praise God
[1:17:57] hallelujah see the children of God are
[1:18:00] manifest in the children of the devil
[1:18:02] whosoever doeth not righteousness is not
[1:18:04] of God neither he that love not his
[1:18:07] brother next in John 8:47 he that is of
[1:18:11] God heareth God's word ye therefore hear
[1:18:15] not because ye are not of God see you
[1:18:18] can we can see it there are two kinds of
[1:18:20] people on this Earth see the children of
[1:18:24] the devil and the children of God Amen
[1:18:27] see the children of God will always
[1:18:29] listen to the word of God amen glory see
[1:18:32] praise God the children of the devil
[1:18:35] praise God see whatever we you know how
[1:18:40] much we share to them we cannot do
[1:18:43] anything about it okay praise God see
[1:18:48] but we are not in the position to judge
[1:18:50] anybody that's or you will say oh maybe
[1:18:52] it's the children of of the devil no
[1:18:54] don't do it that's right okay praise God
[1:18:56] say as much as possible put it in your
[1:18:59] heart that everybody it seems that
[1:19:01] everybody can be saved see but we know
[1:19:04] not everybody can be saved but we need
[1:19:07] to have that in our heart that
[1:19:09] Compassionate Heart don't lose that in
[1:19:12] your heart once you lose that compassion
[1:19:14] in your heart you are done you're are
[1:19:16] finished amen praise God see next see so
[1:19:22] this is the plan praise God there are
[1:19:23] the children of God they are the
[1:19:25] children of the devil he says the field
[1:19:28] is the word and the Harvest time is the
[1:19:30] end of the world and the reapers are the
[1:19:33] Angels see even Jesus is trying to tell
[1:19:36] to the people that there is an end of
[1:19:39] the world see praise God you know that's
[1:19:42] why all the scientist now is trying to
[1:19:44] go to the Mars planet Mars you know who
[1:19:47] wants to go there see praise God
[1:19:51] hallelujah that's that's that's the
[1:19:54] farthest that a human knowledge can do
[1:19:57] right see they know they know it the
[1:20:01] right place to escape from this
[1:20:04] distraction is to
[1:20:06] fly see praise God God knows it see
[1:20:12] that's the only way is to fly right
[1:20:16] that's why we sing that song I'm fly
[1:20:19] away to Glory I'm Fly Away amen by and

[1:20:27] anymore I Fly
[1:20:29] Away amen hallelujah they know it see
[1:20:34] praise God but they just do not want to
[1:20:37] accept the way of God see they have
[1:20:40] their own way see so in this world the
[1:20:44] original plan of God next so if this is
[1:20:46] the world the original plan of God next
[1:20:49] is to just have sons and Daughters of
[1:20:53] God that's the that's the that's the
[1:20:56] original plan but something happen next
[1:20:59] the children of the devil appear right
[1:21:02] see now we have two classes of people
[1:21:04] now on Earth amen right see the Son of
[1:21:07] God and the son of the devil see praise
[1:21:10] God whether you like it or not that's
[1:21:12] the Bible praise God and you can see it
[1:21:16] around you right if you don't believe
[1:21:19] see a lot of people believe that

[1:21:38] amen amen see I that's why I always tell

[1:21:43] to heaven that's why uh one brother told
[1:21:47] me brother nestar always want to get
[1:21:50] everything free I said yes because that
[1:21:51] is scriptural
[1:21:54] [Laughter]
[1:21:55] that is
[1:21:57] scriptural see it's in the Bible I'm
[1:22:00] legalist when it come to

[1:22:44] cannot borrow it you need to pay it in
[1:22:48] cast Hallelujah see praise God Hal
[1:22:52] Hallelujah
[1:22:54] see that's why we like I love free
[1:23:00] okay see
[1:23:03] now we need to go okay how these things
[1:23:07] happen where how this the Son of God and
[1:23:10] the son of the devil how how these
[1:23:13] things happen you know so we need to go
[1:23:16] back in the SE chapter the Book of
[1:23:19] Genesis amen praise God the book of
[1:23:22] Genesis come from the root word Jin see
[1:23:26] it means seed next praise God see praise
[1:23:30] God see Genesis now it says here in
[1:23:33] verse three in in verse 1 and two now
[1:23:36] the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:23:38] beast of the field which the Lord God
[1:23:40] had made and he said unto the woman yeah
[1:23:43] had God said You shall not eat of every
[1:23:45] tree of the garden so that's why I've
[1:23:49] been telling it to the people you know
[1:23:51] look if you believe the Bible the
[1:23:53] serpent can speak it can speak right
[1:23:57] that's the Bible he talked to the woman
[1:24:00] see praise God the serpent is not a
[1:24:03] snake see praise God hallelujah that's
[1:24:06] why when I went to Vietnam when I went
[1:24:08] to Myanmar you know they are translating
[1:24:10] the message and then when I uh when when
[1:24:13] I was with a a Vietnamese minister so
[1:24:18] when I when I read this scripture I I
[1:24:20] said to that the translator do you know
[1:24:22] that translator is the very key when
[1:24:25] you're going out of the mission see
[1:24:28] praise God when I read this quote then I
[1:24:31] I stopped him I said okay tell them that
[1:24:33] the serpent is not a
[1:24:34] snake he said no but the Bible said it's
[1:24:37] a snake yes it's a snake but tell it the
[1:24:42] Bible write it that way but the serpent
[1:24:44] is not a snake no he said it's in the
[1:24:47] Bible okay that's right it's in the
[1:24:50] Bible see PR praise God then I told him
[1:24:53] okay the King James Bible say it's a
[1:24:56] serpent but when you translate it to any
[1:24:59] language it will not give you serpent it
[1:25:02] will always tell a snake yeah right see
[1:25:06] even in our Bible any Bible because it's
[1:25:11] a mystery right amen see it's a
[1:25:14] mystery see praise God Only The Prophet
[1:25:19] revealed the serpent is not a snake yeah
[1:25:22] amen okay so I tell I tell that to them
[1:25:25] okay now that's look if that is a snake
[1:25:29] it can speak yeah see one it can speak
[1:25:33] see and it's in the garden and that's
[1:25:37] open his eyes you know oh oh yeah he
[1:25:39] said yeah okay so he explained further
[1:25:42] see to tell it to the people because
[1:25:45] that is the key you know they need to
[1:25:50] understand that the serpent is not a
[1:25:51] snake praise God if you don't understand
[1:25:56] Genesis what happened in the Garden of
[1:25:58] Eden you're lost everything happened
[1:26:02] there and it will reveal even the
[1:26:04] godhead see why Jesus need to be born
[1:26:08] out of sex why why is the Virgin bird
[1:26:12] why Blood everything everything is in
[1:26:14] the Book of Genesis see sir praise God
[1:26:18] so the serpent talked to the woman and
[1:26:20] the woman speak to him also he
[1:26:24] said he said unto the
[1:26:34] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[1:26:37] Trees of the garden see so verse two it
[1:26:40] says they can eat all the fruit right in
[1:26:44] the Trees of the garden so she's
[1:26:47] referring to the Garden of Eden okay now
[1:26:52] in verse
[1:26:54] three but of the fruit of the tree which
[1:26:57] is in the midst of the garden now
[1:26:58] there's another Garden the midst of the
[1:27:00] garden see praise
[1:27:03] God but of the fruit of the tree which
[1:27:06] is in the midst of the garden God had
[1:27:08] said ye shall not eat of it neither
[1:27:10] shall you touch L you die and the
[1:27:13] serpent said unto unto the woman you
[1:27:16] shall not surely die but for God do know
[1:27:20] that the day you eat thereof then your
[1:27:22] eyes shall be open and you shall be as
[1:27:25] Gods knowing good and evil see so
[1:27:29] remember what did Satan wants to be he
[1:27:32] wants to be equal with God he do not
[1:27:35] want to be up above God he just want to
[1:27:38] be like God see praise God see so this
[1:27:43] is the same thing that she offered to
[1:27:45] the woman that she will be like God see
[1:27:50] praise God hallelujah yeah then and when
[1:27:53] a woman saw that the tree was good for
[1:27:56] food and that it was pleasant to the
[1:27:58] eyes and the tree to desire to make one
[1:28:01] wise she took of the fruit thereof and
[1:28:04] did eat and gave also unto her husband
[1:28:06] with her and he did eat see so it
[1:28:10] tempted the woman and the woman took the
[1:28:13] fruit and she ate it then after eating
[1:28:16] it she gave it to his husband and the
[1:28:20] eyes of them both were open and they
[1:28:22] knew that they were naked and they s fig
[1:28:25] lips together and made themselves aprons
[1:28:28] see praise God now
[1:28:31] next so these are the three major
[1:28:34] character the serpent Adam and the woman
[1:28:37] praise God they were always you know
[1:28:40] like the prophecy truth were always
[1:28:43] overlooked see
[1:28:45] hallelujah praise God that's a problem
[1:28:48] now okay so what really happened in the
[1:28:52] Garden of Eden yeah so the serpent
[1:28:55] offered to the woman to be like God
[1:28:56] remember that is our key word to be like
[1:28:58] God Amen so now here
[1:29:02] next now when this thing happened God
[1:29:05] was angry with the
[1:29:08] serpent so he cursed the serpent he
[1:29:11] cursed the
[1:29:12] woman see but not Adam okay praise God
[1:29:17] see Hallelujah
[1:29:20] now even in the or we have what we call
[1:29:24] the you know
[1:29:26] some uh cases it
[1:29:29] can you know there is no Witnesses
[1:29:33] right like a murder or rape there is
[1:29:38] nobody will
[1:29:39] rape somebody with a
[1:29:42] witness see how can you prove it right
[1:29:46] how can you pin the
[1:29:48] suspect it's through circumstantial
[1:29:51] evidence
[1:29:53] okay so same thing because uh you know
[1:29:55] people are asking how these things
[1:29:56] happen Okay let's look at the
[1:29:59] circumstances see Hallelujah and the
[1:30:02] Lord God said unto the serpent because
[1:30:04] thou H has done this Thou Art cursed
[1:30:06] above all cattle see so again the Bible
[1:30:08] said the serpent is not a snake it is
[1:30:10] like a cattle and above every beast of
[1:30:14] the field so he is on the field upon thy
[1:30:16] belly so that is the time that the
[1:30:19] serpent crawl shall go and thus shalt
[1:30:23] thou eat all the days of thy life see
[1:30:25] and I will put enmity between thee and
[1:30:29] the woman and between thy seed see so
[1:30:32] something happen that has a connection
[1:30:35] with the
[1:30:36] seed see he said to the serpent your
[1:30:39] seed and her seed the woman seed it
[1:30:42] shall bruise thy head and thou shallal
[1:30:44] bruise his heel that's right see praise
[1:30:47] God
[1:30:48] hallelujah next unto the woman he said I
[1:30:52] will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[1:30:56] conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring
[1:30:58] forth children and thy desire shall be
[1:31:01] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[1:31:03] thee see praise God and to the woman he
[1:31:06] said now you are going to give
[1:31:09] birth y see that's why it is not a
[1:31:14] normal thing for the woman to give birth
[1:31:17] right this is that is not a natural
[1:31:19] thing so something happened that has
[1:31:22] something to do about giving birth see
[1:31:26] praise God look at the cow the cattle
[1:31:28] when they give birth you don't you don't
[1:31:30] bring them to the hospital right see
[1:31:34] praise God but to a woman my
[1:31:37] goodness Hallelujah you do a lot of
[1:31:40] things you know just when the baby come
[1:31:43] out you know you need to do something a
[1:31:45] lot of things but when they cutle when
[1:31:47] they when what do you call that small
[1:31:49] cow see when it come out you just you
[1:31:52] just look watch it and look it until it
[1:31:54] stand up and then you clap your
[1:31:58] hands but you cannot do it to a
[1:32:02] baby you let it alone it will die
[1:32:05] because it is not a normal thing right
[1:32:08] for the woman to give birth remember
[1:32:11] that this is not a normal thing so
[1:32:13] something happened praise God praise God
[1:32:15] and it has something to do with the bird
[1:32:17] it has something to do with the seed
[1:32:19] praise God see and unto Adam he said
[1:32:22] because thou has hen unto the voice of
[1:32:24] thy wife and has eaten of the tree of
[1:32:26] the which I commanded thee saying Thou
[1:32:28] shalt not eat of it curse is the ground
[1:32:31] for thy sake in sorrow Thou shalt eat of
[1:32:34] it all the days of thy life see so God
[1:32:38] did not create us to work praise God see
[1:32:42] that's why it's always in the father's
[1:32:45] in the parents heart see to work for
[1:32:48] their children praise God they want to
[1:32:50] earn a lot of money money in that way
[1:32:52] their children no need to work see
[1:32:56] praise God because God did not create us
[1:32:58] to work that's why even if you earn a
[1:33:00] lot of money today you're working there
[1:33:03] is a time that you do not want to earn
[1:33:05] money anymore right even how much they
[1:33:08] give you I'm
[1:33:10] tired because it is not normal to us to
[1:33:14] work okay something happened that we
[1:33:17] need to work okay I'm not telling you to
[1:33:19] become lazy see no work no itat okay
[1:33:24] remember that praise God hallelujah see
[1:33:29] praise God see but it is not a normal
[1:33:32] thing to us see praise God God did not
[1:33:35] create us to suffer remember that he is
[1:33:39] our father praise God no no father here
[1:33:42] that he wants his his children to suffer
[1:33:45] praise God hallelujah if any if if if
[1:33:49] you know if there is some if there is a
[1:33:51] suffering the parents want to carry it
[1:33:53] for their children see praise God that
[1:33:56] is the very responsible parents remember
[1:33:58] that Hallelujah see now okay so this is
[1:34:02] the keyword next see so now
[1:34:08] see we know wait
[1:34:13] okay the Bible is written you know
[1:34:17] sometimes is parabolically symbolically
[1:34:20] metaphorically and some time we say it
[1:34:22] it's a natural spiritual okay so now
[1:34:26] praise God we are dealing here in the
[1:34:28] Book of Genesis see if I say natural if
[1:34:31] I say spiritual you know in Matthew
[1:34:33] chapter 4 Jesus said man shall not live
[1:34:36] by bread alone but by every word that
[1:34:39] proceeded out of the mouth of God so we
[1:34:42] have two kinds of food right so we have
[1:34:44] the natural food and we have the
[1:34:46] spiritual food see the bread we eat it
[1:34:50] naturally for our body right see we have
[1:34:54] a natural body then we have the
[1:34:56] spiritual food see the word of God that
[1:34:59] proceed out of the mouth of God see we
[1:35:02] do not come here every Sunday and tier
[1:35:05] one page okay praise God Genesis chapter
[1:35:08] 3 we're going to eat that next month H
[1:35:10] next week and everybody bring bring that
[1:35:13] page and eat it in the church no we
[1:35:14] don't do that when we are listening and
[1:35:17] we are reading we are already eating it
[1:35:20] right spiritually right see so now you
[1:35:23] understand when I say natural and
[1:35:24] spiritual okay next praise God so there
[1:35:27] is the garden see like I told you there
[1:35:30] is the Garden of Eden where all the
[1:35:32] fruit of the trees next praise God see
[1:35:35] where all the trees they have their
[1:35:38] fruit and you can eat it naturally MH
[1:35:41] okay praise God there is the midst of
[1:35:43] the garden praise God that is an
[1:35:46] spiritual Garden because in that Garden
[1:35:49] there are only two kinds of tree
[1:35:52] the tree of life and the tree of
[1:35:53] knowledge next praise God see and the
[1:35:57] fruit of the Tree of Life Is Life and
[1:35:59] the fruit of tree of knowledge is death
[1:36:02] that's why I said the all of these are
[1:36:04] spiritual right because praise God you
[1:36:07] cannot buy the tree of knowledge in Lula
[1:36:10] Georgia no that's right right you cannot
[1:36:13] find that in Walmart no no right praise
[1:36:16] God or in any mall can you buy a tree of
[1:36:19] knowledge none see so it means this is
[1:36:23] spiritual this is natural see like
[1:36:26] avocado mango banana these are natural
[1:36:29] fruit they are growing in natural tree
[1:36:31] they are planted in natural garden and
[1:36:34] you eat it
[1:36:35] naturally see praise God hallelujah so
[1:36:39] this now what is the so what is see now
[1:36:43] in the scripture next praise God it says
[1:36:46] here in John chap 10: 10 the thief
[1:36:49] cometh not but for to steal and to kill
[1:36:52] and to destroy I am come that they might
[1:36:55] have life and that might have it more
[1:36:57] abundantly see here you can see the two
[1:37:01] three one tree produce death one tree
[1:37:05] produce life see they are side by side
[1:37:08] see one give you that one give you life
[1:37:11] life abundantly then next it says here
[1:37:14] in John 151 I am the true B and my
[1:37:17] father is the husband man praise God
[1:37:19] next praise God see Hallelujah see Jesus
[1:37:23] said I am the tree and you are the
[1:37:25] branches see so these two tree are you
[1:37:29] know they are a person see praise God as
[1:37:33] long as they listen they eating the
[1:37:36] fruit praise God see they are fine they
[1:37:40] will live right praise God hallelujah
[1:37:45] see Hallelujah see now what is the
[1:37:50] fruits what is the fruits that the woman
[1:37:53] eat eat you know next we have a parallel
[1:37:57] scripture in Proverbs 3: 30: 20 it says
[1:38:00] such is the way of an adulterous woman
[1:38:02] see it and wipeth her mouth and say I
[1:38:05] have done no wickedness see so this
[1:38:08] woman she did something she eat the
[1:38:10] fruits see that's why Jesus said by
[1:38:13] their fruits you will know them amen by
[1:38:17] their fruits you will know them amen by
[1:38:20] their works you shall you will know them
[1:38:23] by their acts you will know them see so
[1:38:27] the fruit and the ACT they are same
[1:38:30] praise God see so this woman he make a
[1:38:34] certain
[1:38:35] act he ate it and she said I do know
[1:38:40] wickedness see she
[1:38:44] do she is an adulterous he committed an
[1:38:47] adult adultery Act Right sure praise God
[1:38:51] see Hallelujah see so what happened you
[1:38:55] know what did the woman do remember like
[1:38:57] I told you we have the circum
[1:38:59] circumstantial evidence right praise God
[1:39:05] see Satan offer her to be like God y
[1:39:09] right right see look in Genesis chapter
[1:39:12] 1 in Genesis chapter 2 you cannot see
[1:39:15] that God
[1:39:16] heals there is no
[1:39:18] sickness right there is no salvation why
[1:39:22] there is no fall yet how can he save
[1:39:25] when there is no fall how can he heal
[1:39:27] sick when there is no sickness see what
[1:39:29] is the only thing that the woman can see
[1:39:32] the woman see that God is a
[1:39:37] Creator right right that's right praise
[1:39:40] God see so the when the serpent offer
[1:39:43] him that he's trying to tell him you
[1:39:46] will be like God you will be like a
[1:39:49] Creator see praise God and remember we
[1:39:53] have four Kingdom on this Earth the
[1:39:54] kingdom of the plant the animal the fish
[1:39:58] and and the bird and each kingdom and it
[1:40:03] and each kingdom God gave them the power
[1:40:05] to procreate right right praise God see
[1:40:09] and each kingdom they procreate
[1:40:13] differently see like the chicken like
[1:40:16] the bird they lay
[1:40:18] egg see praise God
[1:40:21] have you seen cow lay egg no
[1:40:24] no they don't lay
[1:40:27] egg the three bear flowers see praise
[1:40:32] God you never seen a chicken you know
[1:40:34] bear flowers no they procreate
[1:40:39] differently see remember the serpent is
[1:40:43] an animal corre praise God what the
[1:40:46] animal do he introduce it to the
[1:40:51] human see that same Act Right praise God
[1:40:56] see there's no Young no no no children
[1:40:59] okay right see that same act sex is of
[1:41:03] the
[1:41:04] animal okay right praise God the animal
[1:41:08] introduced it to the woman it was not
[1:41:11] supposed to be we are not supposed to
[1:41:14] come here by sex right praise God we are
[1:41:17] like God how God create by spoken word
[1:41:21] so we can create by a spoken word
[1:41:24] without sex amen see it is of the animal
[1:41:28] amen the animal introduced it to the
[1:41:31] human being that's why in the eyes of
[1:41:33] God it was so dirty
[1:41:36] right it was so dirty
[1:41:39] right praise God that's why in the time
[1:41:43] of in the time of Israel when you do
[1:41:46] that praise God
[1:41:49] yeah without the proper
[1:41:53] way all the children up to 10
[1:41:56] generation cannot enter into the
[1:41:59] congregation see the the blood of the
[1:42:02] animal cannot cover that kind of
[1:42:05] sin even if you kill a million
[1:42:09] people just one maybe one one cup of
[1:42:13] blood yeah of the Lamb MH is sufficient
[1:42:18] to cover that sin amen that's right but
[1:42:20] that kind of sin yeah the blood of the
[1:42:23] animal cannot cover it it's so strong
[1:42:27] right that's why God needs a very strong
[1:42:30] Covenant see that before you do it you
[1:42:33] need to be under that Covenant right we
[1:42:36] call it the marriage
[1:42:38] covenant see praise God don't do it
[1:42:41] outside the Covenant if you do it
[1:42:43] outside that marriage covenant we call
[1:42:45] it fornication right right see if you do
[1:42:49] it after the Covenant we call it
[1:42:51] adultery see don't do it amen praise God
[1:42:55] it's so sacred that's why the Bible said
[1:42:58] marriage is Honorable and the bed will
[1:43:01] be
[1:43:02] undefiled see if you do it outside that
[1:43:04] Covenant everything that you will do
[1:43:08] it's so dirty in the eyes of God right
[1:43:10] amen because that is not the will of God
[1:43:13] see it's a permissive will of God that's
[1:43:16] why I've been telling it to the young
[1:43:17] people don't do it
[1:43:19] amen pray God see or you get married
[1:43:23] it's so easy praise God see there is no
[1:43:28] divorce praise God don't be don't use it
[1:43:31] as an option right praise God that's why
[1:43:34] the prophet said that's a problem in
[1:43:37] even in the time of Jesus that's right y
[1:43:39] That's confronted Jesus Jesus said then
[1:43:42] the the people asking why did Moses
[1:43:44] allow it it was not so in the beginning
[1:43:47] that isn't a perfect will of God because
[1:43:50] of your heart hardness of the heart
[1:43:51] that's right amen Moses God allow Moses
[1:43:55] it is not of God God allow Moses amen
[1:43:58] see praise God and it was written in the
[1:44:00] Bible and these theologians keep on
[1:44:02] reading it it say in the Bible it's in
[1:44:04] the Bible if God allow it see that's why
[1:44:07] the prophet said it's a misinterpreted
[1:44:09] theology see then thirdly in our age it
[1:44:13] become a modern condition because
[1:44:15] everybody is doing it see that's why the
[1:44:19] prophet said tell your children teach
[1:44:21] your children don't do it that's right
[1:44:24] see right but sometimes these things
[1:44:27] happen see to me you know praise God
[1:44:31] it's plaguing The Message Church also
[1:44:34] praise God everywhere I go I've been
[1:44:35] telling it to to the people you know
[1:44:38] sometimes it's hard to tell it to them
[1:44:40] sometimes I don't know if I tell it if I
[1:44:42] still have a open
[1:44:44] door praise God but this is the
[1:44:47] message that is the first problem in the
[1:44:50] garden of Eden right right who may who
[1:44:54] do it first right Adam I mean Eve what
[1:44:58] did Adam
[1:45:00] do did he cast her out
[1:45:04] no in all sins the only solution is
[1:45:10] forgiveness right see that's the only
[1:45:12] solution
[1:45:13] forgiveness see we have no hope right
[1:45:17] did Jesus cast us out no
[1:45:21] he forgive us amen amen praise God so
[1:45:24] this things did not come from the Lord
[1:45:26] not not uh this is not the way of human
[1:45:28] you know is the serpent the animal
[1:45:30] introduces to us and we are doing it and
[1:45:33] we need praise God that marriage
[1:45:36] covenant praise God hallelujah we don't
[1:45:38] believe in premarital sex amen praise
[1:45:41] God don't do it don't do it praise God
[1:45:44] hallelujah see so next now so here's the
[1:45:49] serpent and there's Adam there's the
[1:45:51] woman there are the three major
[1:45:53] character praise God the serpent did
[1:45:55] something next to the woman he
[1:45:57] introduced the way of reproduction of
[1:45:59] the animal sex see that's why sex is of
[1:46:02] the animal next praise God see then the
[1:46:05] woman pass it to Adam and that produced
[1:46:08] The Fruits right next praise God see
[1:46:12] next see there's can next and there's

[1:46:19] serpent seed
[1:46:20] will always be in enmity they were the
[1:46:23] serpent seed will always be against the
[1:46:26] seed of God see so Cain kill Abel see
[1:46:31] just in the beginning just in the start
[1:46:33] next praise God see H Allelujah then
[1:46:37] Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived
[1:46:39] and bear C and said I have gotten a man

[1:46:43] brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of a
[1:46:46] sheep but Cain was a taor of the ground
[1:46:48] see so they have both different DNA yeah

[1:52:00] giants on the earth in those days and
[1:52:02] also after that when the sons of God
[1:52:05] when the sons of God came into the
[1:52:06] daughters of men and they bear children
[1:52:08] to them the same became Mighty Men which
[1:52:11] were of the of old men of fre know next

[1:54:18] wife went into the Ark and the sons of
[1:54:21] Noah that went forth to the ark were
[1:54:23] shame hem and japed and hem is the

[1:58:44] nakedness both of them shall surely be
[1:58:46] put to death their blood shall be upon
[1:58:48] them right yeah see so you can see this
[1:58:51] parallel scripture uncover his father's
[1:58:54] nakedness what did H do he saw the
[1:58:58] nakedness of his father see so Leviticus
[1:59:03] and the Book of Genesis there is only
[1:59:05] one writer that is Moses see praise God
[1:59:10] hallelujah so he's using the same
[1:59:12] language okay praise God hallelujah see
[1:59:17] so you know some people ask me
[1:59:19] so why did not the the scripture said
[1:59:22] then shall surely be put both of them
[1:59:25] shall surely be put to death their blood
[1:59:27] shall be upon them I
[1:59:29] said during the time of Noah there is no
[1:59:33] law see if there is no law you cannot
[1:59:37] accuse anybody see right praise God Amen
[1:59:41] remember that if there is no law we have
[1:59:43] no sin it is the law that tell us that
[1:59:46] we are a sinner right praise God God
[1:59:49] right Hallelujah see
[1:59:53] next so Genesis 10 verse 6
[1:59:58] so Noah said Canan will be the servant
[2:00:03] to his brother see so now the sons of
[2:00:07] ham Co MRA put in Canan so four of them
[2:00:11] okay next praise God see so this
[2:00:16] is the three Brethren of
[2:00:20] Canan right
[2:00:22] right ham did it he uncovered his father
[2:00:26] nakedness the Bible
[2:00:28] said a man that
[2:00:32] lith wife of his
[2:00:35] father uncover his father nakedness so
[2:00:39] what did ham do he lith with his
[2:00:42] father's wife see who is the wife of his
[2:00:47] father his mother right y see next
[2:00:51] praise
[2:00:53] God see so supposed to be Canan will be
[2:00:58] the servant to his brother right praise
[2:01:01] God because that is the curse see next
[2:01:04] praise God see but he become the servant
[2:01:07] of Shem he become the servant of japet
[2:01:10] why see next praise God
[2:01:15] see the man lith with his mothers with
[2:01:18] his father's wife uncover his father
[2:01:22] nakedness so that is our key word so
[2:01:24] what did H do next see and you see these
[2:01:29] circumstances Canan become the servant
[2:01:32] to his two brother why see The Logical
[2:01:36] the only logical answer is next praise
[2:01:39] God they are
[2:01:41] Brethren see next why see they came from
[2:01:47] the same woman
[2:01:49] see they came from the same woman see
[2:01:54] what did H do he uncovered his father
[2:01:57] nakedness and the scripture is very
[2:01:59] clear it says he that lith with his
[2:02:02] father's wife uncover his father's
[2:02:04] nakedness so what he what he did
[2:02:08] something happened with M Noah and ham
[2:02:11] see praise God what happened praise God
[2:02:15] see Hallelujah Noah found Grace remember
[2:02:18] this Noah found Grace in the eyes of God
[2:02:20] next see here's see can these things
[2:02:25] happen that the son will Li it with his
[2:02:29] mother okay so you know C is one of the
[2:02:32] ham children cus do you know
[2:02:36] samiramis see they are husband and wife
[2:02:39] and they have a son who is their son
[2:02:41] next Nimrod right right who is the wife
[2:02:45] of
[2:02:46] nimrod next his mother
[2:02:49] MH see you can you know Al Alexander
[2:02:53] hipop to Babylon you can see it praise
[2:02:56] God where did
[2:02:58] nimrod get that
[2:03:00] idea from their father like father like
[2:03:04] son see that's why Jesus said to this to
[2:03:07] this uh to the Parise s you do what your
[2:03:10] father do they are following you know
[2:03:13] this this boy will not do unless they
[2:03:16] saw it from their father
[2:03:19] see they will not do anything unless
[2:03:22] they saw it from their father they saw
[2:03:24] their father do it who do it him see
[2:03:28] praise God hallelujah see so there's
[2:03:32] where's the mother and son worshiping
[2:03:33] okay praise God I know you have studied
[2:03:35] this before next praise God see now so
[2:03:40] this is the direct quote of the Prophet
[2:03:43] see it says here now Noah and his son
[2:03:45] which come come out hamem and japet come
[2:03:48] out in the righteous line they were in
[2:03:50] the righteous line how did the seed ever
[2:03:53] get over the seed come over in the Ark
[2:03:56] in the ark it's in the ark see like just
[2:03:59] like it did in the beginning through the
[2:04:02] woman again it's through the woman see
[2:04:06] so when Noah did that for 10 generation
[2:04:09] God did not deal with
[2:04:12] men Noah did something that he found
[2:04:16] Grace in the eyes of God see praise God
[2:04:20] when he did that so what will the
[2:04:22] children do they will follow what the
[2:04:25] father did see from through the W
[2:04:28] through the woman then their wives they
[2:04:31] carry the seed of Satan through the
[2:04:32] Earth just as he pack the seed of Satan
[2:04:35] to give birth to Cain through the woman
[2:04:39] see praise God that is the code of the
[2:04:41] Prophet amen praise God like I told you
[2:04:44] there is we have the circumstantial
[2:04:47] evidence praise God God how why did
[2:04:50] Canaan
[2:04:51] become a servant to sh and
[2:04:54] japet the only logical answer he is they
[2:04:58] are Brethren see he was not he did not
[2:05:02] become the servant of course he or misra
[2:05:06] or put okay so when that happened it
[2:05:09] only show praise God all of us that the
[2:05:12] blood of the serpent next when God
[2:05:14] created us is remember so even science
[2:05:18] proof it we know this see they call it
[2:05:21] heteropaternal super condemnation to
[2:05:25] which the born with different father see
[2:05:28] that's why I've been telling it to the
[2:05:30] people even science is proving it it can
[2:05:33] be done it can be done what happened in
[2:05:35] the Book of Genesis can be done next
[2:05:37] praise God see so another you know
[2:05:40] because we need one or two witnesses see
[2:05:43] when you are trying to give evidence we
[2:05:44] give one or two witnesses amen next
[2:05:47] praise God see so when God created us we
[2:05:50] are all
[2:05:52] clear see but then next something happen
[2:05:56] the blood of the animal come into our
[2:05:59] body see that's why the Bible is very
[2:06:01] clear for all have seen and have come
[2:06:03] short of the glory of God in the eye of
[2:06:06] God whoever you are whatever the color
[2:06:09] of our skin brown white black yellow any
[2:06:12] color blue orange see our blood is
[2:06:17] contaminated M sure see praise God in
[2:06:21] the eyes of God you know we are we are
[2:06:25] good to burning yeah see right we are no
[2:06:29] good in the eyes of God right praise God
[2:06:31] see that's why
[2:06:33] next see for the wages of sin is death
[2:06:36] but the gift of God is eternal life
[2:06:38] through Jesus Christ Our Lord next
[2:06:40] praise God see for by grace are you
[2:06:43] saved so we cannot save by works it's
[2:06:45] only by Grace see praise God
[2:06:49] because the the the problem is in the
[2:06:51] blood right see not in your act it's in
[2:06:54] the blood praise God it went into our
[2:06:58] body see that's why next praise God
[2:07:02] hallelujah see next I said in my heart
[2:07:06] concerning the estate of Sons of man
[2:07:08] that God might manifest them that that
[2:07:11] they might see that they are themself
[2:07:13] are
[2:07:14] beast we become like
[2:07:17] animal see sure praise God that's why a
[2:07:21] person a a man or a woman without God in
[2:07:25] their life they act like animal see
[2:07:30] praise God and do you know what is the
[2:07:32] law of the animal the law of the Jungle
[2:07:35] see the law of the Jungle the fittest
[2:07:38] survive see that is what's happening
[2:07:41] today you know praise God hallelujah
[2:07:45] hallelujah so that's what happened in
[2:07:47] the Garden of Eden like I say praise God
[2:07:51] hallelujah it needs to be you
[2:07:53] know to the to the message people it's
[2:07:56] very clear right praise God what
[2:07:59] happened in the Garden of Eden what
[2:08:01] happened to us that's why we understand
[2:08:04] why God need to die on the cross to
[2:08:06] spill that blood to redeem us because
[2:08:10] something happened in our blood praise
[2:08:12] God see we act like animal praise God
[2:08:16] you were born like that that's why God
[2:08:18] is not going to blame us if we are
[2:08:20] sinner God is not blaming us because we
[2:08:24] were born like that God will blame us
[2:08:26] because you do not accept the way of God
[2:08:30] see his provided way for us to be saved
[2:08:34] like I say it is free amen you don't
[2:08:37] need to do anything you just need to
[2:08:40] humble yourself see praise God because
[2:08:43] today A lot of people do not know why
[2:08:46] they need salvation yeah they thought
[2:08:48] they need salvation praise God just to
[2:08:51] join the church that's why when you when
[2:08:53] you talk to them about salvation they
[2:08:55] are thinking that you want them to join
[2:08:57] their Church they don't know the reason
[2:08:59] why why I need to be saved see why I
[2:09:02] need Jesus that's why some people just
[2:09:05] are looking for religion that will
[2:09:06] benefit them that will uh link or
[2:09:10] synchronize or will align with their
[2:09:12] thought see they don't know really what
[2:09:15] happened in the Garden of Eden once they
[2:09:17] know it then they will understand why we
[2:09:20] are like that why some people praise God
[2:09:23] when they hear the word of God they
[2:09:25] freely readily accept it why some people
[2:09:28] praise God you keep on pounding they
[2:09:30] even just screw their head still they
[2:09:32] don't listen
[2:09:34] why see but then we saw it amen amen
