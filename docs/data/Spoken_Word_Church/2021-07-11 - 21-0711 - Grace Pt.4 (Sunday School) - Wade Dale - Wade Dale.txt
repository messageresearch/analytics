========================================

have brother david said well sister angela's already been here so good to have brother david with us today so um we are talking on grace we've got a kind of using this new format here with the sunday school going on downstairs with the young kids and then the young adults up here right the young adults up here man so let's we've been talking about grace and this will be grace number four let's pull up the uh the definition the hebrew lexicon the definition of grace is favor charm favor grace elegance favor and acceptance and we'll get to that a little bit more when we look at grace in the definition because look this word favor is also a part of favorite all right so now god doesn't show favoritism but he does show favor all right he shows favor to people that especially like the old testament he said if you'll live my law then this is what i'll do for you if you you know blessings i'll bless you cursings i'll curse you and all these different things but we know that and we'll read it in just in a minute that grace only god could develop grace man can't develop grace because we do have our favoritism remember it's all in who you know remember well it is all in who you know if you know jesus christ you get his grace if you don't you get his judgment so let's go to the next one this has come out of the uh out of the dictionary which we know that brother branham told us that grace was unmerited favor but i want you to look at this this is unmerited divine assistance now there's only one divine and that's the lord jesus none of us are divine through him we are divine but this is telling us though that look a virtue coming from god unmerited divine assistance given to humans god doesn't need grace he is grace we need grace for their regeneration our so in other words you need grace by grace are we saved through faith all right but we also need grace for every day and i'm going to read your scripture here in a few minutes in romans the bible tells us listen grace is not for what you're gonna do that's catholicism you go and say four hail marys and you that's why the that's why the mob the mafia love to be catholics because they go in and say look i'm gonna kill four people tomorrow. give me some grace and then you know four hail marys and pay ten thousand dollars and whatever you do tomorrow you're you're uh absolved from it but we know that's not god god gives grace for what is in the past you can't get grace for something listen if you want to try to get grace for something you're going to do tomorrow and you know what's wrong that's iniquity that's not and that takes you completely out from under grace all right if you know you're going to do it tomorrow and you just put it in your mind you're going to do it say well god forgive me i'm going to do it now there's no forgiveness for that there's not until you do it and then you're falling into iniquity and that's the whole that's the old part look at people today how many how many people do you know in this in this world that has any grace only the bride of jesus christ only the people that have the new birth are graceful people or people that have grace in the world there's no grace it's all judgment you do this you don't do that we'll read that in just a minute so but it's a virtue coming from god it's not coming from man so it's a virtue coming from god a state of sanctification enjoyed through divine look at how many times it says divine because it is not humanly possible to give grace because you say i never will hold a grudge well you just think about it yourself you just think about yourself about when you talk about holding a grudge against somebody okay you have your favorites and god does too god has his favorites but it's because of the word of god it's because we're called bride and we get the new birth everything else is not under grace because listen when the two witnesses go to israel there will be no grace given to the world because she's already spurned her day of grace under the gentile prophet brother branham then he cuts off the gentiles there's no more grace for that for for the there's nobody going to get grace except for the jews well when god takes the message so what are you saying by the way the mess every message is tied to grace because you take a prophet when a prophet comes on the land he does two things i know he does three but let's just look at these two he brings what grace to some and judgment to others remember he comes down he speaks his message it's judgment to the ones that don't take it and it's grace to the ones that do so that's exactly what the two witnesses are going to do they're going to go over there to israel or they're going to be there in israel and they're going to preach grace to and 144 000 is going to accept it they're going to continue to preach that grace for 1260 days we'll cover it this afternoon in the sermon and only 144 000 people are going to are going to accept it the whole world is not going to accept it there is no grace for the gentile dispensation after the bride leaves so guess where grace is today it's in the bride of jesus christ amen also grace means approval so we're going to put that word approval in here we read genesis 6 verse 8 but noah found approval or favor in the eyes of the lord noah found grace or approval in the eyes of the lord why didn't noah pick jon jones or or jim somebody else noah was the one that found grace in the eyes of the lord so god gave him grace to what preach a message for 120 years of grace you say no it was judgment it was grace they chose judgment the grace was i'll build you an ark and i'll get you in here but if you'll look at the at the um the mind of god he only built it big enough for eight people and some animals he knew who was going to accept and who wasn't he knew the whole world was not going to accept it right so being graceful though he gave them an opportunity to be saved so let's go now let's get exodus we read that about moses because moses found grace in the eyes of the lord so let's go over the book of ruth and let's look at this we're ru now here's ruth and boaz which is a type of what church of the bride and i say the church but the bride and christ right all right so look at verse 10 then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have i found grace in thine eyes that thou should take knowledge of me see am i seeing i am a stranger and boaz answered and said unto her watch it hath fully been showed me he already knew who she was he already had he had found out who she was and he gave grace look all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband in other words he looked back at her history and he saw now let's go to the book of esther and let's make that a little bit more here's another woman in the bible name esther esther 2 verse 16. now remember you can only come into the king when the king called you right and it didn't matter if he didn't call you for a year you couldn't go in to see that king unless he called for you amen and now esther is realizing and seeing that something's fixing to happen to her people she hasn't been called by the king but she just doesn't know that the king is so desiring to see her that he's just as happy as he can be he puts a crown on her head when he instead of dying instead of having her head chopped off he puts a crown on her head same way with me and you so esther was taken under king of source into his house royal in the 10th month which is the month t beth seventh year of his reign and the king loved esther above all the women so there was a history he said what are you saying brother there's a history god god is graceful to those that need grace he's grateful to the ones that have a look at david david needed grace or he would have been killed but it was in grace through the prophet that came nathan so watch this here and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace now i wrote myself a note it was her life that she had with the king before this time it's what found favor everybody got that it wasn't just oster i don't know who she is no look she obtained grace in favor in his sight more than all the virgins now the time before that she hasn't seen him in 30 days now she's the queen but he's so busy and got other he's got 100 concubines and he's got all these different ones but esther is his queen he hadn't seen her for 30 days he was so happy to see her because of what he knew who she was so he extended grace because of who she was not what she was going to become she extend god extends grace to me and you for looking at our life brother adam just said it he said i'd rather you live me a life than preach me a sermon god's going to find grace in your life not so much what you preach or what you talk out of your mouth and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashtime now we know that because of what vast i did vashtai had grace at one time because she was the queen so the denominations or the or the world out there they had some grace with god during the different times of the church ages but there was a time when vast i said i'm not going to take what god said anymore i'm going to have my own idea and my own party we've been through the book of esther several times but esther found grace and favor in his sight because of what he remembered of what she was right all right so what brother brown tells us he said we need to what remind god what are you doing you're reminding god he you don't he don't need to be reminded but he wants you to tell him that's right he wants you to tell him now he don't want you to be the where esther didn't walk in and say now bless god i'm better than any of these people in here i'll prove it to you no she walked in humble she remember she didn't put on the clothes that were so extravagant she just put on a regular normal dress and did her hair herself and and walked into the to the uh to the king and the king found grace toward esther because at the point when she goes in she's supposed to be killed if he hadn't called her which is in another scripture besides this one but she obtained grace i want to ask you a question if you obtain grace that's our question today if you obtain grace no i'm just grace grace and my nose yet sometimes that's greasy grace i can do what i want to but but have you obtained grace in the eyes of the lord because look let's go to psalms 84 11. we're going to stay with the bible maybe next sunday we'll read some quotes but i like to just leave it in the bible because this is sunday school class so we're going to take it in the bible if you can't prove anything in the bible then you ought to be doing this anyway amen for the lord god as a son and shield the lord will give grace and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly all right let's go to proverbs 1 verse 7 the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction my son hear the instruction of thy father and for satan not the law of thy mother for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck see there they found favor now watch this right here in zechariah 4 verse then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord now we know that we come up we know who the zerubbabel is a type of of the uh you've got the one coming in you've got prophet of god preaching the message building the pyramid building the statue of perfect man but listen to what he says not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who out there o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone now who's the headstone christ christ is the headstone all right and you and i must become that too but look therefore with shoutings crying it's going to take double grace to get us into the capstone to get us to the headstone you say double grace by the way you're gonna need grace for your soul every day that you sin you sin don't you don't sin in your soul but your sin and your spirit you need grace for that and then you need grace for this thing because that's talking about the body change grace grace unto it what that great mountain or you we always point back at the statue of a perfect man but that's you i love the one where they got you know the lord jesus picture in there you know imposed behind it but you need to put your place in there you put your your face and your body in there because that's the statue of perfect man's already been proven by god through jesus christ it's already been proven by william branham that's right amen now who's it got to be proven by the bride of jesus christ because the headstone is going to come forth shouting crying double grace or grace grace unto it now watch in zechariah 12 10 this is what we were talking about a few minutes ago and i will pour out the house of david upon the inhabitants now this is talking about the two witnesses going to jerusalem we're going to talk about that this afternoon in the eternal redemption because we've got to get the jews redeemed they're part of it they're just not part of it right now and i will pour upon the house of david and who is that jews and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem it's kind of funny that that you take you take the daniel 70 weeks and it's what is to thy people and thy city thy people david thy city jerusalem all right the spirit of what grace and of supplication are a spirit of what acceptance and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one morning for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is bitterness for his firstborn listen let's look at this just for a second when those two witnesses go to to the jews and they begin to preach the message of grace that jesus christ has already come that jesus christ has already i say got a gentile bride born again and got them out of the way they're going to look at that and they're going to do what the bible says they're going to cry and mourn and say just like what just like remember reuben and all the different ones when joseph was standing there and he revealed himself to him they said we're dead we're in trouble we we supposedly killed that man we killed our own brother but now what did joseph say he said don't worry this was not done for like in other words frivolously this was not done it was done what to preserve life because had joseph not come and got the vision of seven years of of plenty and seven years of famine the whole world would almost been wiped out because of the famine right but he gave grace to joseph joseph being a type of christ now what they're going to do is is they're going to see that through the preaching of the gospel see you can only see grace through the preaching of the gospel amen right there is no grace listen we see that the law we'll look at it in just a minute the law was given for transgression but grace and truth came by jesus christ we'll read it in just a minute so those two prophets are not going to bring an old testament gospel now they're going to be old testament prophets per se everybody got that elijah and moses but now remember the mentality of israel at this moment of the jews at this moment is what he's not coming to the gentiles he's coming to us right the messiah is coming to us he's not coming to them and that you know we're just going to maybe come in later on and we're looking for the messiah we're looking for elijah and we're looking for this because their eyes were blinded and actually their eyes were blinded the jews eyes were blinded for grace for me and you because remember we have no promise we just have a promise of a little hearing a little there and a little rahab coming in and a little esther and a little different ones coming in that are not jews by lineage but see they missed it because god blinded their eyes literally blinded their eyes so that you and i could come in well that was grace to us and it was grace to them because remember he'd already put them away and god's not going to be without a wife he's going to have a bride that's his listen what did he tell man what did he tell he said mary husband and wife created he them everybody got that that god is going to have a bride but once he divorced israel he had to marry somebody so he chose a gentile bride to marry put the jews away but by grace he couldn't forget them so he had to send them grace by two prophets he had to send them grace after you and i leave so the grace of god is not just to the bride right because remember we're going to talk about later on that even the grace of god goes all the way to the white throne judgment right because somebody's going to get eternal life because of grace right because of unmerited favor that somebody changed your tire or was good to you or gave you a cup of water in the name and even the foolish virgin is going to have grace at the white throne judgment they're going to make it amen but they just not bribed but they're going to make it all right everybody with me it's 1007 so we're getting pretty close so now let's go to john 1 verse 14. it says in the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth full of grace and truth now let's continue reading john bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom i spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and of his fullness have all we received look and grace for grace see john the baptist come in under the law though he was under the law he was an old testament prophet he was under the law but he was seeing that there was a messiah that was going to come so he had to introduce him under grace not judgment right but now who took the judgment the religious people of the day turned him down they turned john's message down they killed john and they didn't believe jesus was a messiah so see it wasn't grace there was your prophet standing there with two things to do he gave grace to a group of people that accepted it and he gave judgment to a group of people that did not accept it amen so now look for the law was given by moses now what was the law do's and don'ts written letter you pick up sticks on sunday you die or saturday i'm sorry saturday you die on the sabbath right you commit adultery you both get stoned you do this you're gonna get there was no grace but now remember you watch though as we back up from what we were talking about you say well there by the way there was no grace in the old testament yeah the grave was full of grace look at moses he killed an egyptian he was a murderer yet god used him to lead a group of people along the way david was a murderer and an adulterer and god still used him rahab was a harlot god still used her you see the different things of grace coming in there but there is a law that was given by moses that you go by but look but grace and truth came by jesus christ now what the prophet god tell us and i'll read this quote next sunday where brother brown said he said i thought that jehovah hated me and that jesus loved me right you know what he said uh when i was studying the bible as he was a young christian and studying the bible he was reading all them do's and don'ts in the old testament and how god would send a plague and kill 20 000 people but you he wasn't i say he wasn't he wasn't at the time looking at that god actually stopped those plagues by grace of moses and the different ones that run through with the sensor but then he finally saw remember he said then i'll read the new testament and there was just full of grace jesus just was right there with the sinners and the prostitutes and he was saving the people and he was doing this and he was doing that but he realized that they were the same person they were just in two different dispensations but it's all a dispensation of grace but there was a dispensation of law because the law had to come by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ now look this romans 3 verse 24 know i made the statement a few minutes ago that grace is not for what you're going to do that's catholicism lord i'm going to sin tomorrow i need your forgiveness i'm going to go to the priest and do you know four hail marys and no that's what i told you before that's iniquity that's a big difference there's not any grace and iniquity because you knew better and you did it anyway or you didn't do it and you should have done it being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus now watch what paul's trying to tell us whom god has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness i really enjoyed what brother well i enjoyed both of them brother mike bringing in hope versus faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not saying you have to have a hope first but that hope has to go into faith if it's not it's just hope when god has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness look for the remission of sins that are past you can't get forgiveness of sins you're going to do tomorrow that's why you have to pray daily that's why paul says i died daily that's why that you should be in in daily prayer asking god to forgive you of your sins because it's not for sins lord i'm going to sin next week five times and i can't help it you're right you can't help it you're just saying you can't help it but we go through life and we we say god please forgive me for that because you don't you listen is anybody condemned about what they're going to do tomorrow think about it it just brings a blank spot in your head you don't even know what you're going to do tomorrow but you know you're going to sin every day amen in our humanity not in your soul if you're born again it's in your humanity you're going to sin and you're going to go to god and you're going to then what's it going to do it's going to bring your remembrance what you did and then you're going to ask god to forgive you let's read romans 4 verse 15 and then we'll stop right there it's 10 12 musicians get ready to come on we'll stop a little early we got some uh good to see brother curtis and sister dawn and their family with us this morning romans 4 verse 15 because the law look the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace you've got to believe that god will forgive you your sins before you can even get forgiveness you've got to believe that that god will what wipe it out of his memory see that's grace every one of us have a past life i don't care if you lived and chewed you your teeth on the message pew you still had a past life hey man bc before christ amen so but then you to get born again though you got to have grace you got to have grace to get y'all come on in hey come on you're not going to bother me because we're getting ready i want everybody to be seated when we get get done the sunday school class is coming in from downstairs therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace look to the end the promise might be sure to all see sure to all seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all let's read romans 5 19 musicians come on for as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners talk about adam so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover the law entered that the offense might abound but where sin abounded grace did much more about that as sin hath reigned unto death even so my grace reigned through the righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord listen we have an out but it's not greasy grace it's by grace through faith you have to believe that jesus christ took your sins you have to believe that jesus christ extended grace to each and every one of us amen so you just think on that and we'll continue on a little bit more next sunday god bless you
