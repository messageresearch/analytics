[3:19] be very long amen so god bless you
[3:23] tonight we're going to look into the
[3:24] scripture and go to first John chapter 1
[3:29] and then just read the scripture here
[3:34] and before we read let's just all bow
[3:36] our heads and speak to the author our
[3:40] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're just so
[3:43] thankful Lord for another opportunity to
[3:44] be in your house Lord that we're just
[3:47] able to gather in Lord is all the things
[3:51] that are happening in the world and Lord
[3:54] there's a lot of uncertainty a lot of
[3:57] distress but Lord we know that there's a
[4:00] place to run to Lord there's a place of
[4:04] refuge to enter in Lord and we can just
[4:06] let off the pressure there's no distress
[4:08] there's no worry Lord because we can't
[4:10] we know what is certain Lord and we know
[4:13] what is truth and we know what is real
[4:15] and father we just pray tonight you just
[4:17] come Lord and help us get out of the way
[4:19] Lord each I knowing each one that's here
[4:22] Lord the ones that are listening in
[4:24] through the way of the hook couple
[4:25] ordered the internet I pray that you
[4:27] just be with them and and touch them in
[4:29] a special way tonight Lord just give us
[4:31] what we have need of tonight Lord Lord
[4:34] whatever the needs are father I pray
[4:36] that you just go and minister to each
[4:38] one follow you know each heart Lord you
[4:41] know what each need is but even before
[4:43] we ask or do you know what it is in your
[4:45] have the answer for it Lord you've
[4:47] already paid the price for it all and
[4:50] Lord we're just so thankful for that
[4:52] Lord and we just give you praise and we
[4:53] just look under you tonight Lord for all
[4:55] things in the name of Jesus Christ we
[4:57] pray amen amen
[5:01] first John chapter one and my title
[5:07] tonight is walking in the light as he is
[5:10] in the light and that's very important
[5:14] because you know people walk in a light
[5:18] but they don't walk in the light as he
[5:21] is in the light because that's what John
[5:26] tells us he said but if we walk in the
[5:27] light as he is in the light and that's
[5:32] what I want to look at tonight he says
[5:34] that which was from the beginning which
[5:37] we have heard which we have seen with
[5:39] our eyes which we have looked upon and
[5:42] our hands have handled of the word of
[5:44] life for the life was manifested and we
[5:47] have seen it bear witness and show it
[5:49] unto you that eternal life which was
[5:51] with the father and was manifested unto
[5:53] us that which we have seen and heard
[5:56] declare we unto you that we that ye also
[5:59] may have fellowship with us and truly
[6:01] our Fellowship is with the father and
[6:03] with his son Jesus Christ and these
[6:05] things right we unto you that your joy
[6:07] may be full
[6:08] this then is the message which we have
[6:11] heard of him and declare unto you that
[6:13] God is light and in him is no darkness
[6:16] at all if we say that we have fellowship
[6:19] with him and walk in darkness we lie and
[6:21] do not the truth but if we walk in the
[6:24] light as he is in the light we have
[6:26] fellowship one with another and the
[6:27] blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses
[6:30] us from all sin and if we say that we
[6:33] have no sin we deceive ourselves and the
[6:35] truth is not in us if we confess our
[6:37] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[6:39] us our sins and cleanse us from all
[6:41] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[6:44] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[6:46] word is not in this man god bless you
[6:49] tonight may be seated
[6:53] this is this is from the message there
[6:58] is a man that here they can turn on the
[7:00] light brother brems says he is the light
[7:06] the truth the light and there is no
[7:09] darkness in him and he scatters the
[7:11] darkness when he comes in because he is
[7:13] the word and the word is the light
[7:16] that's right because he spoke and he
[7:18] said let there be light that was the
[7:20] word that become liked when he speaks
[7:23] this it's not the light of that eight
[7:25] it's the light of that age each time now
[7:29] here he is here in not in a glare but
[7:35] people are living in a glare but he is
[7:38] but he is the vindicated word he is
[7:40] absolutely the light in the time of
[7:43] darkness yes sir all these false glares
[7:46] and things will fade away yes sir he is
[7:48] here don't fear turn on the lights his
[7:51] promise word it lives makes it may he
[7:55] but he that believes in me the works
[7:57] that I do ye shall you do also that is
[8:00] the word then it is the word as the
[8:03] father sent me so send I you the father
[8:05] that sent him come in him the Jesus that
[8:09] sent you comes in you and the works that
[8:13] he did then he does the same thing
[8:15] because why the word has made flesh in
[8:18] human flesh manifest itself as the light
[8:21] of the day there we are there it is it
[8:23] just is showing the way to light in the
[8:26] light wise men who are not blinded by
[8:29] Creed's and denominations will walk in
[8:32] that light
[8:33] amen god bless you because that's what i
[8:37] want to talk about it was walking in the
[8:41] light as he is in the light and brother
[8:44] Brandon brings out two things he talks
[8:47] about there being darkness but he also
[8:49] talks about being a glare and I want to
[8:52] talk about those two things because you
[8:55] know there is people that walk in
[8:59] darkness but there is you know walking
[9:03] in a glare
[9:06] in a false light brother bream talks
[9:08] about it hey coach about a mirage people
[9:11] looking in a mirage and seeing it's just
[9:13] a false light but I want to look at that
[9:18] tonight because you know the light has
[9:20] come and the light has been given to us
[9:23] and we are to manifest that light
[9:25] because we have become that light if the
[9:28] if the word is in you then you are the
[9:30] light of this hour because you are the
[9:33] light of the world jesus said I'm the
[9:36] light of the world but then he said ye
[9:39] are the light of the world
[9:40] so identified you because if we if we
[9:43] have become as brother Brian was
[9:45] speaking here you know if we have become
[9:47] that light because the was the word the
[9:50] vindicated word is the light of the hour
[9:52] and if it's the vindicated word then you
[9:54] become the vindicated word of the hour
[9:56] and you become the light of the world
[9:58] you became the light that he's that God
[10:02] had made manifest he says there is a man
[10:08] here that can turn on the lights
[10:10] alright what does he do by vindicating
[10:13] his word for this day Jesus the Son of
[10:15] God who promised the word for this day
[10:17] is right here with us don't be scared
[10:20] don't pay any attention to what they're
[10:22] doing you do you'll walk in darkness be
[10:25] was they that do wise Daniel said and
[10:28] these last days will do exploits for
[10:30] their God see they'll walk in the light
[10:33] as he is in the light so that that's the
[10:37] thing is to walk in the light as he is
[10:39] in the light because that's what God
[10:41] came to do is identify through the
[10:44] scripture what the day and hour in which
[10:46] we live all in every age and every time
[10:50] God wanted to make known himself and he
[10:53] did through the word and even from the
[10:56] beginning he made itself known and that
[11:00] was his oh the opening of the word him
[11:02] speaking the word as he talked a brother
[11:05] Brent talked about he said that him
[11:08] being the son of God him being the logos
[11:11] and then he stepped out from God to
[11:15] speak and he said let there be light and
[11:18] there was
[11:19] like and he said brother branham said he
[11:22] believed his word he spoke the word and
[11:24] he believed the word and it became light
[11:27] because you know what that's what that's
[11:29] what he was supposed to do that's
[11:30] exactly what was to come forth from him
[11:33] and he believed what he spoke and it
[11:36] came to pass and then it's the same way
[11:39] today one because it's the same God
[11:41] doing the same thing today and so the
[11:44] word you and I have been given to speak
[11:46] you know we are to believe that word
[11:49] well because he's the same he's the same
[11:52] yesterday today and forever so if he
[11:54] give us a word to speak if you give us a
[11:56] word in our day to believe and to
[11:58] proclaim then you know what we believe
[11:59] that word and we speak it because you
[12:03] know we don't have to worry about trying
[12:05] to bring anything to pass we just
[12:07] believe what God said we just speak what
[12:09] God said because he's obligated to bring
[12:12] it to pass he's obligated to fulfill the
[12:14] work it's not our job to do that it's
[12:16] his job to do that well because it's the
[12:19] bridegroom's job to take care of these
[12:21] things it's not the bride the bride is
[12:23] to speak he said because the bride is to
[12:26] become into speaking condition1 because
[12:29] she's supposed to come to a place where
[12:31] she can see the word and understand the
[12:33] word and understand that she is him that
[12:35] she can speak the same word and do the
[12:38] greater works when Jesus said the works
[12:42] that that I do he said you'll do also so
[12:46] when when the devil comes against us her
[12:49] problems comes our way that we wonder if
[12:51] we can overcome no we don't have to
[12:53] worry one because we've already overcome
[12:55] one because he said I've already
[12:57] overcome the world and you have to but
[13:00] the problem is is you we've got to
[13:02] believe that we are overcome too we are
[13:04] more than conquerors through him that
[13:05] loved us if we can see one because if
[13:10] the light is shining on the word for our
[13:12] day than we can see who we are but not
[13:16] just but not just see the word but we
[13:18] are to become that word we had to become
[13:20] that light as as Peter said we'll get
[13:29] into it later he's it as in that day
[13:31] dawn and he said in the day
[13:32] star rise in your heart see there's a
[13:36] there's a light that shines on the word
[13:38] but you know the word has to be in us
[13:44] this in Matthew 26 22 and 23 says the
[13:50] light of the body is the eye if
[13:52] therefore thine eye be single thy whole
[13:54] body shall be full of light and if thine
[13:58] eye be evil thy whole body shall be full
[14:01] of darkness if therefore the light that
[14:03] is in thee be darkness how great is that
[14:07] darkness so as we know the light that
[14:12] was in us is to be our eye they said our
[14:15] eye is to be single he said if your eye
[14:19] is single then the whole body is light
[14:21] so there's no confusion if you know what
[14:26] you're looking at if you know where you
[14:27] are then your body can be full of light
[14:30] but you know the problem is is if you
[14:33] are as Jesus was speaking of here if
[14:36] your eye is single and they don't mean
[14:40] to have one eye but that means whatever
[14:43] you're looking at has to be in one focus
[14:47] Pass has to be exactly on the right
[14:50] thing so if your eye is focused on what
[14:54] needs to be focused on then it brings
[14:56] light to your body because you know what
[14:58] you can't have pard truth you can't you
[15:01] can't be looking at one thing and
[15:03] looking at something else but you've got
[15:05] to be focused both eyes focused on one
[15:07] thing because you know later on whether
[15:13] I'm talked about looking at a mirage see
[15:16] if you if you know what he said if you
[15:18] see that your eye has to be single well
[15:20] if you look at a mirage then you if you
[15:22] understand how am I wrong what a mirage
[15:23] is then you understand your eyes not
[15:25] single so he said if your eye be single
[15:30] he said then the whole body shall be
[15:32] full of light then you know what you're
[15:34] looking at because sometimes see the
[15:37] devil puts things in front of you that
[15:39] are a is a mirage is an optical illusion
[15:42] that when you're looking at something
[15:44] what
[15:44] look that's not true it's not exactly
[15:47] what you're saying you know many many
[15:52] years ago I preached on you know truth
[15:54] versus reality you know we live in a
[15:57] world that it's all about reality you
[15:59] know it's all reality shows and
[16:01] everything's virtual reality in this
[16:02] reality you know and all these top
[16:05] things there everything is about being
[16:06] real you know I'm just going to be real
[16:08] you know everybody talks about being
[16:09] real well you know what it's not about
[16:10] being real it's about the truth you know
[16:14] the thing is it's not it's not about
[16:15] being real because you know what let me
[16:17] tell you when when the Hebrew children
[16:19] were standing in the fire those flames
[16:21] were real when Daniel was in a lion's
[16:25] den he was in there with real lions you
[16:28] know those things when the Egyptian army
[16:31] was behind Moses and the children of
[16:33] Israel that was a real army and they
[16:36] could really kill you
[16:37] but you know what the truth was that God
[16:40] told him he was going to bring them out
[16:43] every single one of them he told even
[16:46] when the Hebrew children come there and
[16:47] said you know what our God is more than
[16:49] able to deliver us from these fiery
[16:51] furnace these flames but you know what
[16:53] even if God don't we're still not going
[16:55] to bow to this image we're still going
[16:57] to stand for the truth and look and
[17:00] Daniel he said you know he just went
[17:01] down in there one because he was going
[17:03] to pray to his God he didn't matter what
[17:05] anybody said to him or whatever anybody
[17:07] tried to hold over and he was still
[17:09] gonna follow the word he was still the
[17:11] one because something had illuminated
[17:13] him and he was standing in the light for
[17:15] his day in his hour and he was standing
[17:17] there and he said even if I go in before
[17:19] these Lions they can't touch me unless
[17:21] God allows it and those and those will
[17:25] those children of Israel Moses leading
[17:27] them out they had a pillar of fire and
[17:29] it had a cloud by day and a pillar of
[17:31] fire by night so they were still
[17:33] following in the light of the word for
[17:35] their day that was leading them and he
[17:37] led them to the Red Sea but you know
[17:39] what they were standing there but you
[17:40] know God had already told them I'm going
[17:42] to deliver you and you know what there
[17:44] was nothing gonna stand there and hold
[17:45] them back because God told Moses spake
[17:48] and go forward
[17:49] speak the word why because you've been
[17:53] commissioned to it's your commish
[17:56] and to speak the word what it doesn't
[18:00] look like there's any way out God's made
[18:02] a way out he's giving us the way he's
[18:07] giving us the word so he just carry on
[18:15] through because we have the victory he's
[18:21] giving it to us if we just keep our eyes
[18:24] single and look at what God has said
[18:27] what God has called us to he said he
[18:31] said brother I said in secondhand robe
[18:33] he said what we need today is faith in
[18:35] the promise of God and don't pay no
[18:37] attention to what this one says or that
[18:40] one says and he talks about a brother
[18:41] had had two girls that were mutant he
[18:46] was talking about divine healing
[18:47] he said the prayer of faith shall save
[18:49] the sick and God show raised them up he
[18:52] said if I can make one deaf mute to hear
[18:55] he can make if he can make one deaf mute
[18:58] to hear he can make another deaf mute to
[19:00] hear we know by infallible proof that he
[19:02] does that he said keep our faith on the
[19:05] promise i single our ear single our
[19:08] heart single and one thing on Jesus
[19:10] Christ that he's able to perform that
[19:12] which he has God made the promise he
[19:18] said God was the one that said it so if
[19:23] he said it then that's what we have to
[19:25] let's all we have to do is look at what
[19:27] he said because God is the one that said
[19:30] because he said you know we don't have
[19:32] to pay attention to anything else
[19:34] because we keep our eyes single our
[19:36] heart single our ear single we're
[19:38] listening to the word we're following
[19:39] and keeping our eye on the word and we
[19:41] don't have to worry about anything else
[19:43] because nothing else is going to matter
[19:44] then we can overcome God has given us
[19:50] the word to overcome
[19:53] if we can believe it's it's Earth's to
[19:57] believe or not to believe but that's all
[20:02] God can do is make his keep it make the
[20:05] way before us and for us to see these
[20:09] things and you and so if we walk in the
[20:14] light as he is in the light and so you
[20:22] know if you go through the scripture
[20:24] there's many in the scripture that has
[20:26] walking in the light of their day and
[20:31] then you know sometimes it just becomes
[20:37] repetitious to people or it just it's
[20:40] just you know that's what mama said or
[20:43] you know that's what the preacher said
[20:44] or you know they just go through the
[20:47] motions and and it's not a reality to
[20:49] anybody you know brother Brown was
[20:51] speaking of Mary listening then she was
[20:55] talking about listening to the rabbi's
[20:57] speak to the great things that that the
[20:59] great Jehovah God had done through the
[21:02] ages and and all of the things that they
[21:04] had talked about and then he was reading
[21:05] the scripture and and you know Mary and
[21:08] Joseph was speaking and reading at
[21:10] Isaiah and they were talking about the
[21:12] things that God had done and the God
[21:13] things that God had promised in their
[21:15] day and you know you know and then and
[21:17] then the clergy or the rabbis and the
[21:20] Pharisees and all that you know they
[21:22] just stand it well you know God used to
[21:24] do these things but you know we've not
[21:26] seen God do anything and we go we wonder
[21:28] if God's just turned his back on us and
[21:30] and God don't do these things anymore
[21:32] and you know and Mary sitting there
[21:34] listening and talking to Joseph and said
[21:35] you know you know God is still the same
[21:38] that he always was and know even though
[21:40] the rabbi may not believe it or nobody
[21:42] else believes that she said but I still
[21:44] believe that he said these things and
[21:46] he's going to bring it to pass why
[21:47] because he's the same one that brought
[21:49] all those through the through the Red
[21:51] Sea and all the things that's happened
[21:53] in the past and we've seen God doing and
[21:55] he's the same one and you know she began
[21:57] to ponder these things in her heart
[21:59] you know she had she had heard the word
[22:01] and she had been read
[22:03] the word and she believed the word and
[22:05] you know even her confession was the
[22:07] word and she continued confessing what
[22:10] was the word to her and it was through
[22:12] it was something that was real to her
[22:15] and she began to walk forward in that
[22:18] and you know then all of a sudden one
[22:21] day and she was walking along and you
[22:23] know brother Brent tells it in a
[22:25] different way so what happened but you
[22:26] know all of a sudden she's walking along
[22:28] in this kind of a dark area or you know
[22:32] doing the laundry or whatever and the
[22:34] next thing you know there's this great
[22:36] light that surrounds her that engulfs
[22:38] her or whatever and then you know all of
[22:40] a sudden this man steps out before her
[22:43] and said blessed Mary said God has
[22:47] granted you favor why because you know
[22:51] here you hear you've all all these years
[22:53] you've believed this word you you've
[22:55] read this word you've claimed this word
[22:58] that God was going to do this that you
[23:00] knew what the prophet Isaiah said was
[23:02] going to take place and guess what
[23:04] you're going to be the one that's going
[23:05] to fulfill this word and Gabriel began
[23:08] to expound to her the scripture and what
[23:11] was going to take place and you know she
[23:13] was troubled at it and you know
[23:15] everybody whoever anybody would brother
[23:17] Graham said even I was standing in the
[23:19] presence of an angel you know you didn't
[23:22] being scared but in April said don't you
[23:24] worry don't fear about this because this
[23:26] is - God has granted you favoring God's
[23:28] gonna do this and you're gonna be G and
[23:31] she said how this how can this be saying
[23:33] that I know not a man they said don't
[23:36] you worry the Holy Ghost is going to
[23:38] come and overshadow you and you're going
[23:40] to bring forth the promised word you
[23:44] don't have to worry about it
[23:46] while you can just walk in the light as
[23:48] he is in the light you just walk in the
[23:50] light that he is showing and then all of
[23:52] a sudden you may not be standing in a
[23:54] physical light but the light will open
[23:56] up and you'll walk in that light and she
[24:00] said being unto me according to thy word
[24:03] Lord just let me be your handmaiden and
[24:06] bring forth the word let me be just your
[24:09] simple servant and bring forth the word
[24:11] and then she could bring forth the word
[24:14] and actually what's standing and
[24:16] walking in this in this light and you
[24:19] know all the ones around the around the
[24:21] community and everything you know they
[24:23] you know how can this be cheetah she's
[24:26] no she doesn't come from a very good
[24:28] family you know her family's not you
[24:30] know the upper echelon of our community
[24:32] you know she's just some lowly little
[24:34] girl you know and she just not what we
[24:36] consider you know that God would come in
[24:39] and deal with but that's alright God
[24:46] likes the humble and the lowly and God
[24:52] like someone's like to use the ones that
[24:54] nobody else considers you know just like
[24:59] just like David when they when he tried
[25:03] all the other brothers you know and
[25:05] there's like hey you got anybody else
[25:06] gods refused all the rest of them and
[25:10] then he had to have a second thought oh
[25:11] yeah there's one more oh yeah that's the
[25:15] one yeah well that's the one that God
[25:17] wants God wants the one that nobody else
[25:19] wants he can use those kind of people we
[25:26] don't have because man will overlook
[25:28] what God is trying to do because what
[25:31] man thinks is great God calls foolish
[25:34] and what God thinks is great man calls
[25:37] foolish that's the reason it takes us to
[25:42] die to ourselves that he can come to
[25:44] live that we can see what's truly
[25:46] important what's truly real what needs
[25:52] what is truly what God sees is eternal
[26:01] because you know if we tried to figure
[26:03] this thing out on our own you know we'd
[26:04] be in a world of hurtin we'd be a
[26:07] million miles off the just reason it
[26:11] takes dying out to ourselves and
[26:14] allowing him to come and lead that he
[26:16] didn't come to in that he can lead us so
[26:19] we can see what's what's truth because
[26:25] nobody's ever going to try to figure out
[26:27] what truth is unless unless it's
[26:30] the true one right he is the truth and
[26:33] he's the only one that can bring the
[26:34] truth so as we see Mary continue you
[26:42] know she's carrying this and you know
[26:46] here she is and and you know it's it's
[26:49] odd to live in this world but you know
[26:52] she's carrying this this word she's
[26:57] carrying this gift that God has given
[27:01] her and you know here here she is
[27:04] carrying this and you know and she knows
[27:06] and nothing's happened to her physically
[27:09] but you know what the the holy spirit
[27:11] overshadowed her and then and then she
[27:14] goes and speaks to Elizabeth that
[27:17] proclaims the word and then all of a
[27:19] sudden in an Elizabeth wound here's
[27:21] here's John that hadn't moved you know
[27:24] late lady assume that he was dead or
[27:26] whatever you know she had a problem and
[27:28] all of a sudden he leaps in the womb at
[27:30] the name of Jesus you know here it isn't
[27:34] that Elizabeth she is she begins to get
[27:38] all excited and thank the Lord you know
[27:40] that here is here's the one that we've
[27:41] heard so much about our Messiah is
[27:44] coming that she that she knows all of a
[27:47] sudden here's here's God's going to do
[27:49] this work that a that he's promised you
[27:51] know 800 years later or whatever here it
[27:54] is it's finally going to come to take
[27:55] place you know there were there was
[27:58] times that you know Mary had to face a
[28:00] lot of criticism and she had to face a
[28:03] lot of ridicule why because you know
[28:05] nobody was going to face and nobody was
[28:07] gonna believe that this little girl this
[28:09] young girl was going to be the one that
[28:12] was going to carry the Messiah was going
[28:13] to fulfill the scripture can you imagine
[28:15] all of the young women and all the young
[28:18] girls for 800 years these women had
[28:21] walked along and you know they had read
[28:23] this scripture and no doubt people had
[28:25] set there and thought you know am i go
[28:27] to be the one you know you know I you
[28:29] know it wouldn't it be great to be the
[28:31] one and you know people's like well I
[28:33] wonder who it would be well you know
[28:35] everybody thinks it's got to be the it's
[28:37] got to be you know the upper it's got to
[28:39] be the the Pharisees or the you know the
[28:42] the
[28:43] scribes are the rabbis or whatever it's
[28:46] got to be it's got to be on the upper
[28:47] echelon or some of the rich people in
[28:49] town or you know the ones that are very
[28:51] famous you know there's got to be a
[28:52] certain group that you know and it can't
[28:54] be just just some little simple person
[28:57] that nobody would you know that nobody
[28:59] would give a second thought to but here
[29:02] they are for 800 years people been
[29:03] looking and thinking oh wonder if it's
[29:05] going to be in my lineage you know
[29:09] everybody's were you know looking to see
[29:12] what was going to take place and it's
[29:15] like mary says that she's gonna carry
[29:18] the Messiah she's got a uh she's a brick
[29:27] shy of the load if you got a wire loose
[29:32] how ridiculous do you see what her
[29:34] family you see what see how our family
[29:36] lives do you see what they own they do
[29:42] you see the kind of church they go to
[29:45] you see her or a rabbi is you know that
[29:50] all of these things they don't see what
[29:52] God is doing and it doesn't matter what
[29:57] kind of background you come from we all
[30:00] come the same way we all came needing a
[30:02] Savior you know we all have faults and
[30:05] our failures and it's not it's not
[30:08] looking out the outside it's looking on
[30:10] the inside because that's what God was
[30:13] looking for he was looking on the inside
[30:15] of the man he was looking on the inside
[30:17] of a girl that would believe that she
[30:22] had that she had a real faith to believe
[30:24] what God had said even though it looked
[30:26] impossible God she still believed what
[30:29] God had said and here she goes
[30:33] carrying this child all this way and
[30:35] then you know even Joseph had had his
[30:38] doubts and you know the angel had to
[30:41] come and God had to come speak to him
[30:42] and and explain these things to him that
[30:44] he had to come and get a real revelation
[30:47] of what was going to take place and
[30:49] actually believe this thing and you know
[30:52] carry you know continue on through all
[30:54] of this and you know and then
[30:56] and then you know they had to go to
[30:58] Bethlehem for the for the taxes and all
[31:01] those things and you know and here they
[31:02] are going through all this and you know
[31:04] knowing that God is coming to do
[31:06] something and you know it looked dark
[31:09] and and all these type things but you
[31:12] know God was going to fulfill his word
[31:14] and you know here they come and you know
[31:17] you you look and you know you wonder how
[31:20] Mary felt when when you know they get to
[31:22] town and everything's packed out and
[31:24] everything's sold out and there's no
[31:25] place to be and then you got to go to
[31:27] this the only place that you can find is
[31:29] you know you know the stable which is
[31:33] you know just the the barn or you know
[31:35] where all the animals are and everybody
[31:37] that's been riding and walking and
[31:39] everything all that all this way and
[31:41] ever you know most likely it was
[31:43] probably packed out because there was so
[31:45] many people come to town and then here
[31:47] you are trying to scrounge around in
[31:48] this little stinky place trying to find
[31:51] a place to give birth to the to the
[31:54] creator of the world and this little
[31:56] stinky little stable and it's maybe
[31:58] crowded and here you are trying to find
[32:01] something to scrounge together to
[32:03] deliver your Messiah and here it is in
[32:07] this in this little way and you know and
[32:09] you're all the things that Mary had to
[32:11] endure all the way through but you know
[32:13] she never lost her faith and believing
[32:15] who she who it was and who she was
[32:17] because you know it wasn't anything in
[32:20] her that was any good because God did go
[32:22] gave her Grace had given her grace shown
[32:25] her grace to do this and in the midst of
[32:28] all this here they come down through
[32:30] these this way and and all of a sudden
[32:33] in the in the midst of all this we know
[32:35] that you know the angels came and it was
[32:37] a light that came to the Shepherd's in
[32:40] the field and all of a sudden and the
[32:42] scripture tells us that was a great
[32:43] heavenly hosted that you know shone
[32:46] around about the Shepherd's and
[32:47] proclaiming and saying to them about the
[32:50] birth of the Savior the the chant that
[32:53] he and they proclaimed the message that
[32:54] that he is born in the City of David as
[32:57] a savior which is Christ the Lord has
[32:59] come to be born this day and they came
[33:02] to see this one the Shepherd's had come
[33:06] to see this one that nobody else Syntel
[33:09] really had any time to deal with or had
[33:11] anything had any consideration of but
[33:14] there was an angel visit to those
[33:16] Shepherds that came and brought the word
[33:19] and and they walked in the light of that
[33:21] message because it lit up you know and
[33:24] it illuminated their vision and their
[33:26] and their thoughts that they had to go
[33:28] see the this Savior and no doubt these
[33:30] men had heard these words and had heard
[33:33] this stuff all of their lives and knew
[33:35] all about this but all of a sudden now
[33:37] here is the the illumination the
[33:40] revelation of this word that people have
[33:43] held onto and many people may have
[33:44] thought that it was just a fable or just
[33:47] some you know feint in you know a well
[33:49] we just keep hearing the brow bars talk
[33:50] about it and then you know all these
[33:52] type things but here it is now they come
[33:55] in and they follow this light and they
[33:56] see this one baby but he's laying in a
[34:01] stable and he's wrapped in swaddling
[34:03] clothes they're probably stank it was
[34:05] probably covered in animal sweat and
[34:06] everything else laying in this nasty
[34:09] little place down here and here is the
[34:11] creator of the world the savior of the
[34:13] world laying before these people you
[34:17] know here you you know here's here's
[34:19] Mary thinking you know you know she had
[34:21] been so yourself felt so alone and all
[34:25] of this and here they here comes these
[34:27] Shepherds tell them you know what the
[34:28] Angels have come and proclaimed this
[34:30] birth and that's the reason we're here
[34:33] to see the Messiah how might you know
[34:36] that would really stir something in your
[34:38] soul that when you when you see these
[34:39] things take place and then all of a
[34:41] sudden these Shepherds come in to see
[34:43] what has taken place you think it's just
[34:45] done something done in the in the in the
[34:48] dark and off to the side and and out of
[34:50] you but you know what God remembered
[34:52] what was taking place and yet he was
[34:53] going to proclaim to the world what took
[34:55] place and at the same time that those
[34:58] Shepherds had come to see Christ being
[35:01] born and come to see this little baby
[35:03] God in flesh laying there they were made
[35:07] job all around the world you know there
[35:08] was the three you know those major eyes
[35:11] had seen it way off in the distance had
[35:13] seen that light one because they were
[35:16] following the word the word had told him
[35:19] that that the the star would be born in
[35:21] Jacob the son of
[35:23] would be born in Jacob and that's the
[35:25] slight became and yet so all these years
[35:28] the manger had been looking for this
[35:30] sign in the sky to take place because
[35:33] they knew that it was going to take
[35:35] place and they kept waiting and all of a
[35:38] sudden in this in this little light
[35:40] shining so far away or whatever but they
[35:43] knew that was the sign that they were
[35:45] looking for and here they are they begin
[35:48] to travel
[35:49] brethren say they walked two years going
[35:52] to see the Sun they walked under that
[35:55] height and he said there were many
[35:56] observatories and different ones
[35:58] wise men that had been other places and
[36:01] they walked right past them in total
[36:03] we're going to go see the Christ the
[36:05] word is being fulfilled and we walking
[36:08] in the light we're walking in this light
[36:10] one because we've seen it in the sky and
[36:13] they began to walk in that light many
[36:16] people though you're crazy and they
[36:19] didn't people stand there looking I
[36:20] don't see nothing I don't see nothing
[36:26] you've got wise men great sages standing
[36:30] there looking in the sky I don't see
[36:32] nothing I don't see nothing but you know
[36:35] what
[36:35] they weren't cold to be the ones to see
[36:38] the light but the ones that weren't cold
[36:40] to see the like they were the ones that
[36:42] were looking and they were the ones that
[36:43] were sad shown the light and they began
[36:45] to travel to that light and they
[36:49] traveled for two years to come see this
[36:51] child and they brought gifts to him the
[36:54] gold the frankincense the myrrh that
[36:56] identified him and who he was and what
[36:59] he would do on the earth deity dedicated
[37:02] for death that he was going to become
[37:04] and fulfill the scripture that he would
[37:06] die to save man from his sin why because
[37:09] he was to be the seed that was going to
[37:12] bruise the Serpent's head that he was
[37:15] going to be the woman see that was
[37:17] prophesied in the scripture also many
[37:19] years before thousands of years before
[37:22] and yet here he was standing in flesh
[37:31] and here was that great light and so
[37:36] many people had heard the same word had
[37:46] heard the same word and you know what it
[37:49] didn't mean anything to him they hadn't
[37:52] seen anything even though people had had
[37:56] looked and looked in the same skies but
[37:59] you know what they hadn't been called to
[38:03] that to see that same light that was
[38:05] shining the dose that those men that
[38:10] came those wise men had come brother
[38:15] brems says he said this is there's a man
[38:19] here that can turn on the light he said
[38:22] it was the angels of God that showed
[38:23] light upon the hill to guide the
[38:25] Shepherd's to the eternal light see it
[38:27] comes by like life can only come by
[38:30] light
[38:31] he said the Shepherd's wanting to know
[38:33] you know when a king is born they have
[38:35] singing great carrying on when the king
[38:37] is born and he was seeing he was so
[38:39] secretly born and he was born in a
[38:41] stable in a manger with the cattle and
[38:43] horses were eating yet he was the king
[38:45] and the angels came down and sang the
[38:48] hymns to the shepherds in the light of
[38:49] the Angels themselves were like to show
[38:52] with the Word of God they had the Word
[38:54] of God and told them today in the City
[38:57] of David and Bethlehem is born Christ
[38:59] the Savior the angel had the word and
[39:01] the word came by like to God and they
[39:03] followed the word of the Angels to
[39:06] eternal life
[39:07] they found the babe there wrapped in
[39:09] swaddling cloth as they had said for you
[39:12] see life only comes by light and he was
[39:15] the word made light or become light the
[39:18] word in that generation he was the word
[39:21] light of that generation because the
[39:23] prophets that old had spoke of him and
[39:25] he and here he come and vindicated he
[39:28] was the light of God spoken word see all
[39:30] the prophets had had had been fulfilled
[39:34] in him see the prophets back there with
[39:36] the word like God up at the beginning
[39:38] when he
[39:39] said let there be light and light came
[39:40] and now the Prophet said a virgin shall
[39:42] conceive bring forth the son they called
[39:45] his name Emmanuel for it'll be God with
[39:48] us now when they had spoke it the word
[39:51] had went out but he was the light and
[39:56] what was he the fulfillment hallelujah
[39:58] he was the fulfillment of that word he
[40:00] was a manifestation of that word so it
[40:02] is today God's Word has been fulfilled
[40:04] at the hour that's the light it's God
[40:07] manifesting himself he was the light of
[40:09] the world so he was the light that
[40:13] became that shine that fulfilled the
[40:15] word and you know here they hear these
[40:18] Shepherds had come to see the word had
[40:21] been fulfilled I no doubt though that
[40:25] was a remarkable experience that Mary
[40:28] had went through and you know so many
[40:32] people that still disbelieve Mary's word
[40:34] and still didn't believe that that they
[40:36] had taken place but you know God never
[40:41] leaves what has the never the word
[40:43] without a witness he has witnesses in
[40:45] the earth and you know it is and it's so
[40:47] amazing that even even when people tried
[40:50] to deny the word and yet Harry ours
[40:54] bringing in more and more witnesses to
[40:58] the same thing because here comes the
[41:00] shepherds but then you know though the
[41:04] wise men came but you know there was a
[41:06] there was a time after after he was born
[41:09] and and the scripture tells us that that
[41:12] Mary and Joseph took Jesus to fulfill
[41:14] the law that had to be circumcised and
[41:17] to fulfill all the scripture and you
[41:19] know here he was in the midst of all
[41:21] that and here this little humble girl
[41:23] bringing this baby and that people gave
[41:26] her a bad name and still made fun of her
[41:28] and and ridiculed for her and she was
[41:31] standing in the temple that day but you
[41:33] know they had heard simians word all
[41:35] those years that he said the Lord has
[41:37] spoke to me and he said I'll not die
[41:39] till I see the Lord's Christ and you
[41:41] know they said well the man man's mind
[41:43] must be sleeping but you know and they
[41:45] go well you know he's just he's just a
[41:47] good old man he's been here forever in a
[41:48] day and you know you know he's got one
[41:50] foot
[41:50] banana peeling one in the grave and you
[41:52] know but all of a sudden you know Simeon
[41:55] no matter how old he had gotten or
[41:57] anything like it he knew what the word
[41:59] had been given to him was and how the
[42:01] word had come to him and it was
[42:03] something that was stirring inside of
[42:05] him that he knew that he was going to
[42:06] see the fulfillment of God's Word and
[42:09] you know what he walked into that temple
[42:11] that day and you know what he said to my
[42:12] brother I said you know maybe he saw the
[42:14] same light that John saw worth as he was
[42:17] leading in and all those women had come
[42:19] bringing their babies to fulfill the law
[42:21] that day and they were standing in a
[42:23] line but you know he came walking
[42:24] through there because he was being led
[42:26] by the spirit and he he came through
[42:28] that line and God told told Simeon to
[42:31] stop and there it was and he took he
[42:33] took the baby from Mary and he said Lord
[42:35] let your servant depart in peace for I
[42:38] have seen the salvation because he had
[42:42] seen what had taken place
[42:45] Luke 22:27 says then he came by the
[42:50] spirit into the temple and he came by
[42:52] the spirit into the temple and when the
[42:54] parents brought in the Child Jesus to do
[42:56] for him as the custom of the law then he
[42:59] took him up out of it in his arms and
[43:02] blessed him and said Lord now lettest
[43:03] thou thy department of servant depart in
[43:07] peace according to thy word for mine
[43:08] eyes have seen thy salvation which thou
[43:11] hast prepared before the face of all
[43:14] people a light to lighten the Gentiles
[43:16] and the glory of thy people Israel and
[43:18] she's Joseph and his mother marveled at
[43:21] those things which were spoken of him
[43:23] and Simeon blessed them and said unto
[43:25] his mother Mary his mother behold this
[43:28] child is set for the fall and rising
[43:30] again of many in Israel and for a sign
[43:32] which shall be spoken against so here he
[43:37] was he came in to speak and yet God you
[43:43] know you sometimes you feel like you're
[43:46] all alone just like Mary you know you
[43:48] feel like you're so alone that you're
[43:50] walking this way all by yourself but you
[43:52] know what God is vindicating his word
[43:54] through the mouths of two or three
[43:56] witnesses and here they are you know
[43:58] after they
[43:59] heard all these things and they had
[44:01] heard the claim that Mary had made
[44:03] before and they ridiculed Mary and here
[44:06] they heard Simeon making this same claim
[44:08] all these years standing in the temple
[44:11] and he came in there and He fulfilled
[44:12] and he matched up exactly what Mary had
[44:16] said and then all of a sudden that we
[44:19] know that Anna the blind Providence
[44:21] began to speak of this one then give God
[44:25] praise for what had taken place because
[44:27] she spoke of the same thing that this
[44:29] was the Messiah that had come to fulfill
[44:32] the scripture here what here's the
[44:34] salvation of Israel
[44:37] here is the light to the Gentiles the
[44:40] scripture tells us see here is the light
[44:42] to the world here he is he's lighting
[44:44] the way and yet people were so blind so
[44:47] walking in darkness because they had
[44:49] walked in a denominational darkness all
[44:52] those years that they had failed to see
[44:54] the truth of God's Word but those that
[44:58] had you know here's Anna she's a blind
[45:00] woman but she had the vision she had
[45:03] real spiritual insight to see what God
[45:05] was doing as they say there's none so
[45:11] blind as hey you will not see because
[45:19] you know many of them they just heard
[45:21] those things and said did you hear what
[45:23] happened at the temple today that little
[45:28] girl came in there you know the one and
[45:32] a Simeon you know the blessed old priest
[45:36] that's been in there forever and a day
[45:39] then lost his mind it was just you know
[45:45] there's so many people to call I can't
[45:46] believe that happened in here could you
[45:47] please Angela we need to get him out of
[45:50] the temple he's starting to lose his
[45:51] mind it's starting to look bad in there
[45:55] and not realizing that was the
[45:57] fulfillment of God's Word and people's a
[46:01] you know because people don't see
[46:03] because they you know it's so they're so
[46:06] dark they walk in darkness they don't
[46:09] see
[46:10] and God is trying to spread the light
[46:18] Matthew 4:16 says the people which sat
[46:21] in darkness saw great light and to them
[46:24] which set in the region and shadow of
[46:26] death light is sprung up and John 8:12
[46:29] says then Jesus again spake speak again
[46:33] unto them saying I am the light of the
[46:35] world he that followeth me shall not
[46:37] walk in darkness but shall have the
[46:39] light of Life so you know he had walked
[46:43] all those years and had all those things
[46:45] said about him and his mother had had to
[46:47] deal with all of those things but you
[46:48] know he kept going but you know there
[46:50] was a day that came when all of a sudden
[46:56] there was this crazy man come out of the
[46:59] woods his dad was a priest and he had a
[47:03] good name and it soon went off be a
[47:08] hermit in the woods the crazy man out
[47:10] there
[47:11] and he come walking out of the woods and
[47:13] this crazy fellows over here met up with
[47:16] this other crazy fellow doubt in the
[47:17] woods in the water down there and he
[47:19] tried to drown him what happened and not
[47:28] realizing that was fulfilling the word
[47:30] why because the Prophet had to come and
[47:33] watch the sacrifice to fulfill the
[47:36] scripture but they didn't see that even
[47:39] when John come out of the woods and told
[47:41] him to repent for the kingdom of heaven
[47:43] is at hand it's like who was this guy
[47:47] you see how he looks he needs he needs I
[47:50] needs a haircut and a bath wearing
[47:54] wearing these you know camel cloth and
[47:57] you know eating grubs and stuff out of
[47:59] the woods and grasshoppers and stuff you
[48:01] know he's not he's not any any good
[48:05] sensible person it's he any kind of
[48:08] person that you want to listen to but
[48:12] you know what he was the prophet of God
[48:14] identifying the Lamb of God identifying
[48:17] the word well because he saw the light
[48:20] shining that the stud
[48:23] over Jesus that he knew that was the one
[48:25] he said behold the lamb of God that take
[48:26] away the sin of the world but nobody
[48:30] else saw that slow to coax down there in
[48:33] the water it's like y'all need to get
[48:37] yelling in the movies folks alone you
[48:38] know they're messing up the sensible
[48:40] people around here giving her everything
[48:42] a bad name we don't we don't need people
[48:46] like that around here did you know he
[48:51] began to expound the word and all these
[48:54] things can you imagine all these people
[48:55] had heard all these things and seen
[48:57] these things and then and you know even
[48:59] when he began to expound the word and do
[49:02] miracles you know what they still didn't
[49:03] believe who he was you're a soothsayer
[49:09] you're Beelzebub you have a devil it all
[49:13] started back there when your mama was a
[49:15] prostitute
[49:17] it all started back there and your
[49:21] cousin like they're living in the woods
[49:22] look like artists he bats come walking
[49:24] out they can say you know who being a
[49:28] prophet and it's the same you know and
[49:33] all the things you think of all this was
[49:35] just a big conglomeration and not even
[49:37] realizing it was the fulfillment of the
[49:38] scripture people had it all screwed up
[49:43] where it was all messed up they just
[49:44] couldn't believe what was taking place
[49:46] and here it is it was the fulfillment of
[49:48] God's Word all the way through his life
[49:50] opening up and identifying himself
[49:56] speaking of a glare see people who
[50:03] walked in a glare of days going by as
[50:09] the Pharisees told Jesus we have Abraham
[50:14] as our Father we know what Moses said
[50:18] and we believe what Moses said and we
[50:20] know what Moses said he's like well if
[50:22] you knew if you Abraham was your father
[50:24] you'd know who I was and if you believed
[50:27] Moses you'd believe me but you're not of
[50:30] your father Abraham you're of your
[50:32] father the devil you don't know who you
[50:35] are
[50:36] your standard because if you knew the
[50:38] day an hour which you'd live you'd
[50:39] rejoice to see this because Moses
[50:41] rejoiced to see this day
[50:43] rejoice Moses was looking forward to
[50:45] this day spoke of this day and you've
[50:50] missed it well because you're walking in
[50:53] a glare and in in darkness and you know
[50:58] when you eat brother I said you're
[51:00] looking in a mirage you know if you know
[51:05] what I'm as a mirage is you know when
[51:08] mirages
[51:10] an optical illusion that takes place and
[51:12] what it is is when your where your line
[51:15] of sight is your sight line do you think
[51:20] when the ground below your light of
[51:23] sight is warmer than the air above it so
[51:28] when you see the ground when you're
[51:29] looking out across the interstate or off
[51:31] across the desert or something when you
[51:33] you know you see that light when you're
[51:35] looking out the ground below your line
[51:36] of sight is all warm and hot and you can
[51:38] see the gas and the steam coming up and
[51:41] above that is cool so it causes because
[51:45] of the way the light is being refracted
[51:47] there you're seeing something there that
[51:49] doesn't exist he said he said you see a
[51:52] mirage and you know and you see this a
[51:54] way off in the distance and he said you
[51:56] know people are trying to chase after a
[51:58] mirage and he said you know they're
[51:59] chasing after a denominational Mirage
[52:01] they see something in the distance
[52:03] that's not even there and you know all
[52:05] this time he's trying to examine and
[52:07] tell them what's truth but they miss
[52:10] them because they're looking at a mirage
[52:13] but you know the problem with a mirage
[52:15] you know you know the two things that
[52:17] are required to fix a mirage you know
[52:20] you know the two things that are needed
[52:21] to have one you know what your causes
[52:23] are distance and height one because if
[52:28] you're if you're up close to one you
[52:30] don't see one but what is it you look
[52:32] off way off in the distance and you can
[52:34] see one and yeah and you're too far down
[52:37] if you had a higher elevation you could
[52:39] see out there realize there's nothing
[52:41] there but if you're off in the distance
[52:42] and you can see way out and you and
[52:45] you're down low and look out across
[52:46] there you know you see all kinds of
[52:48] things
[52:49] and you know when it's hot you see one
[52:52] in this and they call that an inferior
[52:54] Mirage and then if it's cold if it's
[52:56] opposite then you see when they call out
[52:58] a superior Mirage and you know people
[52:59] can see a lot of things and people
[53:01] wonder they see you know there's many
[53:03] people that have claimed to see castles
[53:05] and all kinds of things and bodies of
[53:07] water and you know all these great
[53:08] things that they've seen in their life
[53:10] and they go out there and you know
[53:11] there's nothing there but you know here
[53:14] they are chasing these great things that
[53:16] they see in the distance and they run
[53:17] and run and run and they chase after
[53:19] them and they pursue them and they get
[53:21] out there and there's nothing there but
[53:23] you God wants to bring you closer to him
[53:25] if you come unto me then you can see
[53:28] that you know what is truth because he
[53:30] wants because he's and he's Navi he's
[53:32] not he's not wanting you to be very far
[53:34] off he's trying to come to you because
[53:37] he came to seek answer to save those out
[53:40] which were lost so he came to find those
[53:42] that worry that were in darkness there
[53:45] were off in a distance but he came to
[53:47] bring them closer to him one because
[53:50] then then you can have sight to see but
[53:53] you can't see afar off because you're
[53:55] not designed to see that but you know if
[53:58] you if you come to him that he can give
[54:01] you the sight he can give you the vision
[54:03] to see what needs to be seen and people
[54:06] have looked away off and they and they
[54:08] see great things and they chase after
[54:09] things and didn't realize they're not
[54:11] even there if even people have chased
[54:14] great denominational things and many
[54:16] things that the devil has brought out to
[54:18] people and tried to to put up things and
[54:20] tried to blind people's eyes and he's
[54:22] tried to create these great mirages and
[54:25] these great glares of things and you
[54:27] know people as brother branham said
[54:28] people spend all their time and they're
[54:30] looking back at something that happened
[54:31] in the past and they don't even see
[54:33] what's taking place in front of them
[54:35] what God is doing today thinking like
[54:37] they give God glory for what he done in
[54:39] the past and what he's going to do but
[54:41] they don't realize what God is doing
[54:42] right now
[54:43] well because they're standing in the
[54:45] glare of another age they're standing in
[54:47] the glare of a denominational idea or
[54:49] something Satan has propped up before
[54:51] them and they don't even realize what's
[54:53] taking place today they don't see what
[54:57] God is doing that's the reason their
[55:01] brother Brent
[55:02] he's sitting in God is his own
[55:04] interpreter and he was talking about you
[55:06] know looking through the scripture he
[55:08] said people are looking back it and
[55:10] Luther's dad what a great day Luther's
[55:12] what day was in Wesley's day and
[55:14] Pentecost was what a great day Pentecost
[55:17] was and what a great day that the
[55:19] Prophet when the Prophet was here but
[55:20] the thing is that they're looking back
[55:22] he said but they're not searching the
[55:24] scripture he said because he what Luther
[55:26] had a great day but Luther had to search
[55:29] the scripture for his day there was a
[55:32] day Luther had desert to search the
[55:34] scripture in his day when he found the
[55:36] scripture that was spoken for his day
[55:38] the just shall live by faith then he
[55:41] could turn the world upside down why
[55:43] because that was the set the Lord for
[55:45] his day and Wesley could take the word
[55:48] of sanctification and bring it forth and
[55:50] preach the word and show the people we
[55:52] got to come to a sanctified condition a
[55:55] sanctified life here the Pentecostal
[56:00] this is the great day of the Pentecostal
[56:02] age and they're speaking in tongues and
[56:04] all the great gifts and all these things
[56:05] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[56:07] you know here we come all these great
[56:09] things but you know what they didn't do
[56:10] away with everything they didn't finish
[56:12] God's plan but they keep looking back
[56:15] what God done way back then and then you
[56:18] know Malachi 4 we were we were promised
[56:21] a prophet in our day we were probable
[56:24] promised prophesied a messenger in our
[56:27] day a prophet that would come and bring
[56:29] the opening of the word God would come
[56:32] in human flesh again and stand and speak
[56:34] to us we people looking back what a
[56:38] great day that was what a great day that
[56:40] was but you know what that's not the day
[56:43] that we live in God sent a prophet yes
[56:47] and we can all praise God but why did
[56:49] the Prophet tell us why did the God when
[56:52] did the god of brother Branham speak to
[56:54] us why did he call us to he called us to
[56:58] a greater light you know he didn't just
[57:03] call us to be born again and that's the
[57:05] great thing and we need to that and we
[57:07] need to get people to that but that's
[57:09] not the end of it well because you know
[57:14] people will live in a mirage and you
[57:16] they get to this place where you know
[57:17] you know well you know I've got the Holy
[57:19] Ghost I've got the Holy Ghost well you
[57:20] know what if the Holy Ghost is inside of
[57:22] you then why's the Holy Ghost because
[57:24] the scripture says that he will lead you
[57:26] and guide you into all truth
[57:28] then why is he not leading you and
[57:29] guiding you into all truth
[57:34] well is it is it the way that we've come
[57:37] to this place that we've ruled that
[57:39] people are born again and they sit there
[57:40] and then they just will do it well this
[57:42] is important I'm going
[57:44] or maybe they hadn't even got that far
[57:46] yet why are they living in a glare of
[57:48] another age and they think they're
[57:49] sealed in and they're not even don't
[57:51] even realize that they're sealed out
[57:53] there not in they just they're just
[57:58] walking through in there and they're
[58:00] just going through the motions and not
[58:04] realizing what God has called them to
[58:07] and if he's called us to this then you
[58:10] know he called us to a to a statue of a
[58:13] perfect man not an only just to be born
[58:16] again but but to be mean to the image of
[58:18] Jesus Christ
[58:19] well what did the word do and time
[58:21] brought us Jesus Christ none not even
[58:24] brother Branham you know you know
[58:28] because you know we just gonna walk
[58:29] along and you know but we you know we
[58:31] know that God comes he was Malachi
[58:33] for he felt all of the scriptures that
[58:35] was that was God in human flesh well
[58:38] praise the Lord I believe that but you
[58:40] know what hey he spoke to us that you
[58:43] know what God wants to be the same as he
[58:45] was back then in the same and every part
[58:48] of his bride well because she is
[58:50] supposed to be the Living Word made
[58:52] manifest and everybody looks back at
[58:55] brother Branham oh what a great man we
[58:57] had in our day why because the devil has
[59:03] blinded to people's eyes to the fact
[59:05] what is it going to take for you to get
[59:07] there it takes you've got to have a
[59:12] experience for yourself you've got to
[59:14] have a relationship for yourself you've
[59:16] got to come to that realization for
[59:18] yourself know people people have come
[59:20] along and you know we've got people that
[59:22] nowadays you know will praise the Lord
[59:24] I'm just going to push play
[59:29] well you know what then we just take the
[59:30] scripture and like well you know what
[59:31] that part of the scripture we don't want
[59:33] we just we just gonna throw that out and
[59:38] then you've got other people that come
[59:40] along and it's like can you believe them
[59:43] people they don't believe in a fivefold
[59:45] ministry and then you got everybody else
[59:49] you know well we're just going we just
[59:51] don't get behind it we just gonna get
[59:52] behind our pastor and you know what our
[59:55] pastor is gonna take us in we got a
[1:00:03] brother son so he's my pastor like that
[1:00:06] gets you into heaven it's my pastor
[1:00:16] that's where I go to church like I'd
[1:00:22] does something for you that gonna get
[1:00:25] you anywhere no because if you don't
[1:00:32] walk in all the light as he is in the
[1:00:33] light that's ready they said you gotta
[1:00:35] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:00:38] because you know yep
[1:00:40] I believe in listening to tapes and I
[1:00:42] believe in reading but you know what
[1:00:43] you've got to have an experience for
[1:00:44] yourself you've got to have you got to
[1:00:46] know Jesus Christ for yourself brother
[1:00:48] Branham couldn't give it to you brother
[1:00:50] Dale can't give it to you there's nobody
[1:00:52] can give it to you you've got to know
[1:00:53] Jesus Christ for yourself you've got to
[1:00:56] come to a place where you know that you
[1:00:58] know that you know and if we turn down
[1:01:04] any part of the word then you know what
[1:01:05] we're not walking in the light as he is
[1:01:07] in the light then we're walking in the
[1:01:09] darkness and he said he said if you're I
[1:01:12] had walked in darkness he said how great
[1:01:15] is that darkness if you if your eyes not
[1:01:18] single on the word we've got to have a
[1:01:24] fivefold ministry but if fivefold
[1:01:26] ministry is not going to take you in
[1:01:30] because everybody's like well you know
[1:01:33] you've got this one camp over here and
[1:01:34] you got this one camp over here well the
[1:01:36] thing is you've got it you've got to
[1:01:37] know Jesus Christ for yourself but
[1:01:39] you've got you've got
[1:01:40] understand yes we've got to have the
[1:01:42] message and the message came and you
[1:01:45] know what it's in the in the books and
[1:01:48] the tapes and those sermons brother
[1:01:50] Branham laid it out for us but the thing
[1:01:54] is is he takes a fivefold ministry to
[1:01:56] dig in there and pull these things out
[1:01:58] for us to see these things you know you
[1:02:05] know I feel sorry for a lot of people
[1:02:07] because they live and they live in this
[1:02:09] glare of another age or they live in
[1:02:11] this glare that the devil is has brought
[1:02:13] up and they said before and they think
[1:02:15] they're OK and then you know and then I
[1:02:17] want to try to to judge each other and
[1:02:19] put point fingers at people and don't
[1:02:21] even realise you know what they got
[1:02:23] three more pointed back at them how what
[1:02:27] kind of condition that people are living
[1:02:29] in and not realizing the day and the
[1:02:31] hour which we live it's a it's a time
[1:02:34] that because when the bridegroom when
[1:02:36] when the voice that came and spoke and
[1:02:38] he said he said toad to rise and trimmed
[1:02:40] their lamps
[1:02:42] the Virgin's had to rise and trim their
[1:02:45] lamps and they realized they were
[1:02:46] without all that's the time in which we
[1:02:48] live it's you and I've got to be
[1:02:50] prepared we've got to trim our own lamps
[1:02:52] make sure that we have all we ain't got
[1:02:56] time to go around pointing fingers at
[1:02:58] everybody too many people are got you
[1:03:03] know they're all into everybody else's
[1:03:04] business and it's a sad time because
[1:03:08] people don't realize the late hour in
[1:03:10] which we live that we have to be ready
[1:03:12] for ourselves you know you're not going
[1:03:18] you're not going to do anybody any
[1:03:19] favors people think that you know what
[1:03:21] you know I'm just going to get up and
[1:03:22] I'm just gonna tell these people off you
[1:03:24] know I just come to tell you and I'm
[1:03:28] gonna set you straight and you know what
[1:03:31] you know what needs to be done you know
[1:03:34] what you know what people need you know
[1:03:36] what we need in this hour we need people
[1:03:38] that can live the life of Jesus Christ
[1:03:40] brother Branham said brother Brown said
[1:03:42] we don't need people preaching it he
[1:03:44] said we need people living it that's one
[1:03:47] of the things he said about brother
[1:03:48] Neville what he told my brother Neville
[1:03:49] he said the one thing about her brother
[1:03:50] Neville preached the message he preached
[1:03:52] the word but he said he lived it
[1:03:54] he said that's one thing he said he said
[1:03:56] live it he said live me a sermon he said
[1:03:59] don't preach me a sermon and everybody
[1:04:02] wants to point their fingers and lay it
[1:04:03] out for everybody and tell everybody how
[1:04:05] to straighten up and do all their what's
[1:04:07] right what's not you know what if we all
[1:04:09] got in our prayer clothes and so we
[1:04:10] prayed through and we got to the place
[1:04:12] that we live the life and we well you
[1:04:15] know before we got up and we wanted to
[1:04:16] point out everybody's faults and
[1:04:18] failures and everything you know if we
[1:04:19] spend more time in the prayer closet for
[1:04:21] ourselves and for our brothers and
[1:04:22] praying for them and trying to get them
[1:04:24] to the place where they need to be then
[1:04:26] you know I would be so much better
[1:04:29] because you know what if you live the
[1:04:31] life before somebody somebody can see it
[1:04:34] they can't argue with that
[1:04:38] just like when Jesus raised Lazarus from
[1:04:42] the dead and he said it meet with them
[1:04:43] and they were all gathered in there you
[1:04:45] know what they may not have believed in
[1:04:46] Jesus and they may not like Jesus but
[1:04:48] the one thing they couldn't do was the
[1:04:50] life that was living he had raised
[1:04:52] Lazarus from the dead and they couldn't
[1:04:53] argue with that they could argue with a
[1:04:55] lot of things but you know you can't
[1:04:57] argue what the life lived they may not
[1:05:01] agree with you they may not like it but
[1:05:02] does one think about it if they see
[1:05:04] Jesus Christ on the scene they can't
[1:05:05] argue with that you know that's a that's
[1:05:09] what we need in this out we need more
[1:05:11] people living the life of Jesus Christ
[1:05:13] reflecting the like making the light
[1:05:15] manifest in this hour because I don't I
[1:05:26] don't have time to argue with people I
[1:05:29] don't have time to fuss for people you
[1:05:33] know because what what is it what good
[1:05:34] does it do if you want to if you want to
[1:05:39] be a blessing to somebody walk in the
[1:05:41] light walk in the light as he is in the
[1:05:44] light then people God can see God can
[1:05:49] use your life to see to see Christ made
[1:05:54] manifest
[1:05:59] this is from the message there's a man
[1:06:05] here that can turn on the light
[1:06:07] musicians can come a sizzle he said let
[1:06:10] there be light and there was like yes
[1:06:12] sir he said let there be light and there
[1:06:14] was there is light he spoke there would
[1:06:17] be light in this day and there is light
[1:06:19] he is coming
[1:06:20] I believe it look at the promises of
[1:06:22] this age every like that's ever shined
[1:06:25] these church ages we see has been a
[1:06:28] pitiful sight to see rejecting
[1:06:30] revelation three
[1:06:31] I've got wrote down here revelation
[1:06:33] three when I was referred looked to the
[1:06:36] promise of this hour what we're living
[1:06:38] in a rejected light what did they they
[1:06:42] rejected it back there while they was
[1:06:44] living in a glare what are they doing
[1:06:46] today same thing he said well are you a
[1:06:50] Christian I'm a Lutheran I'm a Baptist
[1:06:52] I'm a Presbyterian he said they don't
[1:06:54] mean one thing
[1:06:55] just might as well say it was a hog pig
[1:06:58] or anything else you want to call
[1:07:00] yourself see that that's that's just
[1:07:03] about how much it means now no
[1:07:06] disregards to you but if you're told
[1:07:09] taking it to its fundamental part that's
[1:07:11] right I asked the question a Christian
[1:07:13] that's Christ in you and if Christ is in
[1:07:16] you then the word is in you then if the
[1:07:19] word is in you then the light is shining
[1:07:21] how you walk going to walk out of it see
[1:07:24] that's the question that's what is in
[1:07:26] Nell the light the evening lights are
[1:07:28] shining the broad tree is blooming so
[1:07:32] the light is shining if the light is if
[1:07:35] we are in the light as he is in the
[1:07:36] light then we are the light of the world
[1:07:39] we are the light to be shining people
[1:07:46] have their own ideas and they're living
[1:07:48] in that glare but you know we are to
[1:07:50] shine the light forth to be the light of
[1:07:53] the hour to show the truth and you know
[1:07:59] what if we if we get to the place and
[1:08:03] and and you know sometimes people will
[1:08:06] you people get upset and
[1:08:11] you know we just want to raise off and
[1:08:13] say something to somebody but you know
[1:08:19] if we have temperance and patience if
[1:08:23] we're bringing God's bringing us up
[1:08:24] through there
[1:08:26] you know we then we know how to deal
[1:08:28] with our brothers when they come along
[1:08:31] and you know we don't snap back at
[1:08:33] somebody but we know what our brother is
[1:08:36] going through and you know we get to the
[1:08:39] place that you know Lord let me be salty
[1:08:41] and Lord allow me to be the one to say
[1:08:45] the right thing because you know
[1:08:48] sometimes people say well you know what
[1:08:49] I'm gonna tell them off that's like well
[1:08:52] you know what maybe we need to pray
[1:08:53] about it you know when when they revile
[1:08:58] Ronald on Jesus everything you know he
[1:09:00] didn't roll back at it and maybe that's
[1:09:04] what we need to do prepare ourselves
[1:09:07] that lord let us be like to them Lord
[1:09:10] let us help them Cory if we can say
[1:09:12] something just somebody let us be a
[1:09:14] light in this hour to the people that
[1:09:17] need that need this light people are
[1:09:19] walking in a glare but you know what
[1:09:22] when you walk in a glare of a and you
[1:09:26] see this Mirage or whatever we need the
[1:09:27] true light to shine and Lord let us be
[1:09:31] that light that shines to the people
[1:09:32] that they can see the hour in which we
[1:09:35] live to see what's truth because you
[1:09:40] know what as long as they're still here

[1:09:50] darkness they be walking in false
[1:09:51] doctrine and a lot of people that have
[1:09:53] walked away and said things and people

[1:14:40] wonderful message tonight I want
[1:14:43] everybody to we're gonna pray brother
[1:14:46] Dutch Scott I'm going to preach for him
[1:14:48] Sunday he can't hardly make it through a
[1:14:50] day they're saying he may have Lyme
[1:14:53] disease and he has paralysis on this
[1:14:56] side of his face and he has to actually
[1:14:57] hold his face up to preach and he has to
[1:15:00] wear a patch on one eye so he's really
[1:15:03] in dire straits so that's I'm going
[1:15:05] Sunday to minister for him there one
[1:15:08] service in Calhoun so that's where I'll
[1:15:11] be but I won't as we dismiss the service
[1:15:13] in just a moment I want everybody to
[1:15:15] come in and while the anointing is here
[1:15:18] and we got all the anointed people here
[1:15:19] don't say anything about the ones that
[1:15:21] not here but reaching reaching say a
[1:15:24] little prayer for brother Dutch and I'll
[1:15:26] take that with me to her brother does he
[1:15:29] he said he can he can cannot work a full
[1:15:31] day because he gets just drained and has
[1:15:35] to stop and actually take a nap before
[1:15:38] he goes back to work against so and
[1:15:40] brother Dutch is not an old gentleman
[1:15:42] but he's he's trying to preach too so he
[1:15:45] was real happy that we were able to to
[1:15:47] go over there and speak for him and also
[1:15:49] I want you to pray this coming Sunday
[1:15:53] we're gonna do just like we've been
[1:15:54] doing normally except all the brothers
[1:15:56] can come there we're not gonna send out
[1:15:58] an email so it's being announced from
[1:16:01] here that the men can just come at your
[1:16:05] at your leisure but I think maybe the
[1:16:07] next Sunday let's see how this works the
[1:16:09] next Sunday is Mother's Day
[1:16:11] that'll be the 10th so we may do
[1:16:15] something different but let's see how it
[1:16:16] goes around in the community let's see
[1:16:18] how the world
[1:16:19] is and me and brother Dale will talk
[1:16:21] about it and we might maybe do a half
[1:16:24] they may maybe let the women come in and
[1:16:27] let them do the servicing yeah no that
[1:16:30] don't work that won't work
[1:16:33] but do something for the mother so just
[1:16:35] pray that we we may do something and get
[1:16:37] the sisters or at least a mother's in
[1:16:40] and and let them sit in the service and
[1:16:42] I just think this thing's fixing to fix
