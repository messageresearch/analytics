[9:00] he said Lord I'd still like to see you
[9:02] well you know what he made an
[9:04] arrangement
[9:05] so if you want to see him he'll make
[9:07] arrangements for you good to see
[9:08] everybody in the house of the Lord
[9:11] he'd like turning your scriptures turn
[9:13] to Revelations 1 where we've been
[9:15] reading and then we will go to John 8.
[9:19] Revelations 1 John 8. remember now to
[9:25] a few of you that won't be gone this
[9:28] next weekend or this coming weekend
[9:30] Bible study will be at six o'clock
[9:34] so remember that come let's Fellowship
[9:36] together
[9:37] and then as Terence says maybe his
[9:39] announcement will we do them where make
[9:41] sure you get it on the internet and
[9:42] people want to hear or come and be with
[9:45] us now remember our Easter time together
[9:47] will be on the 18th we had originally
[9:51] said it would have be the 25th
[9:54] but we couldn't get the building so we'd
[9:56] have to drop it back to the 18th that's
[9:59] on Saturday he's made these
[10:02] announcements and things of what to do
[10:03] and then you know the doing now the Lord
[10:07] willing we're going to have a service
[10:09] here on or have a time here together on
[10:12] the 4th of July which that will be on
[10:15] Saturday all right so it'll follow it
[10:18] perfectly for us to have a time together
[10:21] and hot dogs hamburgers or something
[10:23] whatever you want to cook we'll have a
[10:26] time together and in the afternoon and
[10:28] then have our Bible study at six o'clock
[10:31] we always do be here now the the Fourth
[10:35] of July will be here that the Easter one
[10:37] will be down at Gillsville at the park
[10:40] but just remember that
[10:42] and is as of right now it looks like
[10:45] that we can't make it permanently steady
[10:48] but brother Vernon is supposed to be
[10:50] with us for that weekend the Lord
[10:52] willing so we're going to try to work it
[10:55] out to get him to come over and be with
[10:57] us from the 4th of July that will be our
[11:00] time together you know when we can
[11:02] celebrate kind of our our time that
[11:05] we've had because we started here on
[11:07] July the 4th 1971.
[11:09] so then we can I think this will be my
[11:13] 40 years as Pastor be coming up this
[11:16] time they kind of thought it was last
[11:17] year but it wasn't it's this coming time
[11:20] so remember that okay
[11:23] any other announcements
[11:26] I generally forget something but anyhow
[11:28] okay all right if you'd like turning
[11:30] your scriptures Revelations 1 and John
[11:32] 8. the heavenly father we thank you for
[11:35] your love your grace your time your
[11:38] opportunity to allow us
[11:41] to be able to come together because it's
[11:43] not our opportunity
[11:44] we didn't have anything we didn't want
[11:46] anything we were not desirous of the
[11:49] things of you but you were desirous to
[11:52] fellowship with us and now you're able
[11:55] to do that through the blood of Jesus
[11:56] Christ we just ask you now to have your
[11:59] way with each one of us as we come
[12:01] tonight and try to speak a little bit
[12:03] about you we ask that you would guide
[12:06] each and every one of us in your love
[12:08] and your grace as what to be said
[12:10] Remember the sick among us you promised
[12:12] it that we believe you we thank you for
[12:14] being with brother Benny there today
[12:15] bringing him through the operation now
[12:18] this make everything else to fall in
[12:20] line till it all will be totally well
[12:23] and no problems we love you we thank you
[12:26] father in Jesus name
[12:30] all right
[12:32] Revelations 1 where we've been reading
[12:37] and I turned to see the voice that spake
[12:39] with me and being turned I saw seven
[12:42] golden candlesticks and in the midst of
[12:44] the seven candlesticks one like unto the
[12:47] son of man clothed with a garment down
[12:49] to the foot and gird about the pouch
[12:51] with a golden girdle now we've been
[12:53] aiming to get to that scripture for now
[12:55] for 20-something sermons but we're
[12:57] headed that away so the Lord willing
[13:00] we'll try to get there eventually but
[13:03] you know we don't know what that really
[13:05] would be meaning back there
[13:08] if we did I mean be meaning in there of
[13:12] what to see unless we see what was back
[13:14] there to bring it to pass so that's what
[13:17] we're trying to do John 8
[13:19] and verse 30 and through 32.
[13:24] as he spake these words many believed on
[13:27] him
[13:28] then it said Jesus to the Jews which
[13:30] believed on him
[13:32] if you continue in my word then ye are
[13:35] my disciples indeed
[13:38] and ye shall know that indeed means
[13:40] without any limitation that's it you
[13:42] know that's that's a great statement
[13:45] and ye shall know the truth
[13:47] and the truth shall make you free you
[13:49] may be seated the Lord add his Blessing
[13:51] to the reading of the word then you
[13:53] shall know the truth
[13:55] now not know about truth
[13:59] see which ye shall know that word no is
[14:02] a a great understanding when job said I
[14:06] know
[14:07] My Redeemer liveth he wasn't saying I
[14:09] hope or maybe so or whatever he was
[14:13] making a very positive statement so then
[14:16] I believe and I want to do a little bit
[14:18] different tonight in what we're going to
[14:21] to try to bring and all but
[14:24] I thank God for the truth that has been
[14:26] brought to us in this last days
[14:29] now even if
[14:31] we miss it
[14:33] we should be happy about what we've seen
[14:37] what God has allowed to be open unto us
[14:40] of just the natural things I mean you
[14:44] know when I say natural I mean the
[14:46] things that are not even revealed
[14:49] unto us but to be able to read the Bible
[14:53] and think about things that we used to
[14:56] be so massively confused about in our
[14:59] thinking that it is gradually come
[15:03] becoming more clearer and you know we
[15:07] used to question well why did God say it
[15:09] that way
[15:10] you know he should have said this or
[15:12] that or whatever but see we're finding
[15:14] out that he couldn't say it any better
[15:16] way
[15:17] there was no better way of saying it
[15:19] because one thing he was saying it to
[15:21] hide it from the wise and prude it
[15:24] but on the other he was saying it that
[15:25] way to reveal it
[15:27] to the babes which would
[15:30] you know listen and learn
[15:32] all right and that way then ye shall
[15:34] know the truth
[15:38] there's never been an hour on the face
[15:40] of the Earth to me that there has been
[15:42] the amount of truth of the word of God
[15:46] that is here now
[15:48] all right I believe that even in the
[15:50] time of the Lord Jesus there was no
[15:52] writings
[15:53] you know there wasn't a lot there to be
[15:55] able to study or to talk about you could
[15:59] hear about it or or things like that and
[16:01] what brother Branham one time made a an
[16:04] outstanding statement of like I forgot
[16:06] what it was but we'll call it one
[16:08] thousandths of a hundred percent
[16:11] even knew about Jesus Christ it was a
[16:13] great majority of the people never even
[16:16] knew anything about him
[16:18] all right and see then down through time
[16:21] look what we've had and now even though
[16:24] the bad part
[16:26] you can still go on the internet now and
[16:28] and pick up the end time message and be
[16:32] able to read it
[16:34] now that's a marvelous thing and to me
[16:36] it is now it may not be to you but the
[16:39] many questions we had that's why I write
[16:42] in my Bible
[16:44] a lot of people said I ain't going to
[16:45] write in my Bible That's the holy word
[16:47] of God well that's true but my memory is
[16:49] too short
[16:50] all right so they say that the shortest
[16:53] pencil is better than the greatest
[16:55] memory well I write in my Bible what
[16:59] brother random explain that scripture as
[17:01] to be
[17:02] you know and I then when you come along
[17:05] you know we we're doing some things in
[17:07] Bible study years ago and Josh had my
[17:10] Bible Well you know uh they they
[17:13] wouldn't let him use my Bible because
[17:15] they called it to cheat cheats you know
[17:17] because he had the answers to what
[17:19] something we would the question would be
[17:21] asked he could read it off the page of
[17:24] of my Bible so they they say you can't
[17:26] use that tonight but you know to just be
[17:30] able to do like we do on the um Bible
[17:33] study time
[17:35] you know we just simply are going
[17:37] through the book of Romans
[17:39] and we just take a few scriptures
[17:42] we read a few scriptures and then we
[17:45] just comment around that
[17:47] an understanding of that and then we
[17:51] have open to where they face questions
[17:53] about other things we bring that in also
[17:57] but to the majority we just take the
[17:59] scriptures read it
[18:01] and talk about it you know expound on it
[18:05] what's the words you use you know not
[18:07] that we're any good but just talk about
[18:09] it and see we can say well thank God
[18:14] Sinners for Prophet amen amen and to be
[18:17] able to understand all right now we've
[18:19] been quite a while in the Book of
[18:21] Genesis
[18:24] and getting kind of everything laid in
[18:27] order
[18:27] and I want to if I can tonight to pull
[18:31] us through the scriptures and speak
[18:33] about some things and then maybe pick up
[18:37] a little further into bringing it more
[18:40] down to our time and all like that
[18:43] throughout the you know in the following
[18:45] services so we want to that's the the
[18:48] goal anyway all right
[18:50] now you remember how we went through in
[18:53] the garden
[18:55] and we talked about
[18:57] how or the way that Eve was deceived
[19:01] by Satan's sceptility you know his
[19:04] deceptive points that he could do and
[19:07] he's still doing that today
[19:11] but brother Branham says on the
[19:13] unveiling of God that this bride is
[19:16] going to be tried like Eve was
[19:19] but said she won't fail
[19:22] well he was looking at to the end of it
[19:25] to see you know where it's at and you
[19:28] realize that even just to think about uh
[19:31] that's what I'm talking about the truth
[19:33] just to be able to think about what we
[19:35] what we can read and comprehend
[19:39] you know and all like that and and she's
[19:42] not to be deceived but it's going to
[19:45] take the truth
[19:47] to keep her from being deceived
[19:49] now part truth
[19:51] you can be deceived
[19:53] all right I didn't say lost we ain't
[19:56] talking about none of that
[19:58] when he talking about whether you're
[19:59] born again or what's he doing we're
[20:01] talking about that you could be deceived
[20:03] but a random one time even said like
[20:05] this he said frankly it would get the
[20:08] bride so confused you know deceived if
[20:11] you want to use the point he said God
[20:13] would have to cut to work short
[20:15] now what he means by that I don't know
[20:17] none of my business but I do know that's
[20:20] his words all right
[20:22] but see we've seen those things
[20:25] because we were able
[20:27] to read the Bible
[20:30] for ourselves
[20:33] and then take the message
[20:37] that was delivered unto us
[20:40] and let that be the answers to the
[20:43] previous questions that we once had all
[20:47] right then that way it's not exalting a
[20:49] man or or anything like that it's
[20:51] putting it in order of saying thank you
[20:54] Lord for what we have received all right
[20:57] see in that way we we don't we believe
[21:01] that the messenger was not
[21:03] you know infallible
[21:05] because he was a human being
[21:07] right well he made mistakes and things
[21:09] but the message is infallible
[21:13] all right I believe that now I contend
[21:15] that away and would be glad for anybody
[21:17] to try to come and show me now that I
[21:20] know so much but uh you know come and
[21:23] show us if you think that that the
[21:25] prophet didn't have the truth
[21:28] all right don't take the things that are
[21:30] where he himself made mistakes
[21:34] and I'll take the message
[21:36] that comes through and that way you'll
[21:39] have the truth all right see because
[21:41] this message is the truth
[21:44] all right not part truth
[21:47] it's the truth
[21:49] all right
[21:50] now
[21:52] so let's just take a little time and do
[21:54] something that I love to do
[21:57] and all and uh you know
[22:01] I love to just read the Bible
[22:05] and to just you know just read it
[22:08] and just think about what I'm reading
[22:12] you know
[22:13] I love to do that I love to just just
[22:16] think about it
[22:18] and you know and sometimes you get
[22:20] caught up in wording I realize that
[22:22] because that's the difference between
[22:24] the the uh writings and the the things
[22:28] and and I go back and I look up a lot of
[22:30] words and things and uh write the
[22:33] definition
[22:34] you know I'll go into Strong's and I'll
[22:36] pick up the definitions and Webster the
[22:39] definitions of the words and and I'll
[22:41] write them in my Bible right beside
[22:44] there where you know that when I read
[22:46] that then I have it I don't have to go
[22:50] back the next time you know and look it
[22:52] back up but you know to just be able to
[22:57] read
[22:59] what a blessing
[23:00] just to hear
[23:03] let alone that being revealed to us
[23:06] you know because the world is massively
[23:08] confused over the word of God right
[23:13] you know it's massively Mass confusion
[23:16] to just say well I think it's this and I
[23:19] think it's that
[23:20] well that's what gets me in trouble I
[23:22] guess because I'm not too much on what
[23:24] you think because I'm not too much on
[23:26] what I think all right
[23:28] I like what one brother said about it
[23:30] one time he said he told his man said my
[23:33] church don't care what you think said my
[23:35] church don't care what I think
[23:37] he said is what the word of God says
[23:39] well that's that's the way I want it all
[23:42] right now so let's do something a little
[23:45] bit different tonight instead of
[23:46] preaching and and reading quotes and now
[23:49] I will be quoting all the way through
[23:51] because you have to do that to tell
[23:53] where you get what you're talking about
[23:55] because we definitely uh start number
[23:58] one we did we definitely didn't know the
[24:01] answers right of the things that are now
[24:04] the Simplicity of just reading and
[24:07] saying I understand that
[24:09] you know it was mass confusion and it's
[24:12] still confusing sometimes of the
[24:14] wordings and the things of the Bible
[24:17] because it was written to be revealed
[24:20] it was not written like a newspaper to
[24:23] be just well this means this and that
[24:25] means this and you know it wouldn't that
[24:28] away it was meant to be revealed all
[24:30] right but to just read it so let's do
[24:33] that now we'll just start off
[24:36] and I want to just read the scriptures
[24:38] and then just we'll just simply walk
[24:40] through the scriptures
[24:42] you know one by one and trying to uh
[24:47] understand what has been brought unto
[24:51] you and I as the ability to where we can
[24:53] believe and be able to read so let's
[24:56] start off with it and we're going to be
[24:58] basically in the in the Book of Genesis
[25:00] but it'll be on the board here to us but
[25:03] go ahead and start number one
[25:06] and we'll just read these scriptures and
[25:08] think about the things that you and I
[25:10] know
[25:11] that is really amazing
[25:13] what did you used to think about when
[25:15] you read in Genesis
[25:17] God made man his own image and
[25:20] well I guess he might look like you know
[25:23] well I didn't know because I think God
[25:25] is just like a glob and just floating
[25:27] around and just you know
[25:30] see
[25:31] we didn't it wonderful to be able to
[25:33] read the word of God
[25:36] and to be able to think and know what we
[25:38] know about it and God said let us make
[25:40] man in our image
[25:42] after our likeness and let them not him
[25:45] one see
[25:49] them have dominion over the fish of the
[25:51] sea and over the fall of the iron and
[25:53] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[25:55] and over every creeping thing that
[25:57] creepeth upon the Earth see you think
[25:59] that I
[26:00] I guess sometimes you think I bore you
[26:02] maybe I do with it but see I could stop
[26:04] right there and preach the half a dozen
[26:06] sermons because I believe that's me and
[26:10] you
[26:12] all right if you don't believe that
[26:14] mankind is supposed to have the the
[26:17] ability to lead the animals just
[26:19] remember they're still afraid of you in
[26:21] the natural
[26:22] but then you know some people have an
[26:25] ability with animals to just walk up to
[26:27] them and just the meanest of all and
[26:30] just
[26:31] no problems
[26:33] and see look at the prophet
[26:35] and like I said there for a moment in
[26:38] time
[26:39] nature saw its Master when a man could
[26:43] stand and tell the Beast to go back or
[26:45] tell the bull to go and lay down
[26:47] I believe that's for every one of us
[26:51] I know what the quotes are from the
[26:53] people and some have made it they said
[26:55] they didn't believe that that the third
[26:57] pool was for nothing just for brother
[26:59] Branham and the Lord Jesus well then why
[27:02] write it
[27:04] what was the purpose of having anything
[27:06] written
[27:08] and brother Reynolds said it was for the
[27:10] bride and the church
[27:12] unto the totally lost
[27:15] that doesn't mean anything
[27:17] brother Dale I've I believe
[27:21] well see that's where we put our
[27:23] understanding all right
[27:24] so God created man in his own image in
[27:27] the image of God created he him male and
[27:29] female created he them now we understand
[27:31] the him and the them don't we
[27:35] if you ever remember when we read it and
[27:37] we had a hymn and of them you know him
[27:40] and of them and and it just keeps
[27:43] falling backwards and forth and we we
[27:45] couldn't understand
[27:48] about why it was saying those things now
[27:50] we understand that the first man that
[27:53] was made was what
[27:55] he was made
[27:57] male and female
[27:59] all right it was a them
[28:02] it wasn't him
[28:04] it was with them see all right we
[28:07] understand that because he made
[28:09] them male and female created he them and
[28:14] God blessed them and said unto them
[28:15] watch now back in the spiritual
[28:18] condition because we know in knowing
[28:20] that Genesis 1 26 and 27 and through
[28:23] there is a spiritual man being made
[28:27] in the image of God because this is not
[28:30] the image of God in the bases of of our
[28:32] physical part in that much even though
[28:35] he did come down and I believe he looked
[28:37] like us but yet still the image you're
[28:39] talking about is an exact likeness or a
[28:42] repeat
[28:43] remember how we brought that out that
[28:45] that's not a second person
[28:49] Adam and Eve wasn't the second person
[28:51] that was God made manifest in another
[28:53] form of the way that he wants us to be
[28:58] all right and see then it would come
[29:00] down and even in the spiritual condition
[29:03] he says to them and brother said Eve you
[29:06] know heard that
[29:08] and that's why Satan could talk to her
[29:12] see Satan heard those things too
[29:14] and he said eve don't you remember you
[29:16] were told to multiply and replenish the
[29:18] Earth
[29:20] well see we can all we don't under we
[29:22] don't get into that you know what we get
[29:24] into be fruitful and multiply and
[29:26] replenish
[29:27] the Earth
[29:29] well
[29:31] there must have been another world
[29:33] before this one
[29:35] you ever heard that
[29:38] was people more people were created
[29:41] other than Adam and Eve
[29:44] well
[29:46] I just go back to one scripture that Eve
[29:48] is the mother of all living and that
[29:49] solves a problem but see that people
[29:51] don't want that
[29:53] they want to know what why does it say
[29:55] replenish
[29:57] go and get your Regional and read it it
[30:00] says plenish
[30:02] it doesn't say replenish replenish seems
[30:05] to mean you've had it once you're going
[30:07] to have it again
[30:08] all right well see we don't look at it
[30:11] that there's going to be a spiritual
[30:13] reproduction
[30:17] right
[30:19] I thought we believed in spiritual
[30:22] reproduction in the bases that the seed
[30:24] comes through the body
[30:26] and that you have spiritual reproduction
[30:28] by sowing the seed of the word of God
[30:31] and it being revealed
[30:33] that's some you know spiritual
[30:35] multiplication
[30:36] I thought we believed in that but that's
[30:39] just just to take some points that we've
[30:41] left out upon what we're doing but
[30:43] didn't bring it on through but let them
[30:45] have dominion
[30:47] our Dominion is this Earth
[30:50] God's Dominion is heaven that's quoting
[30:53] brother random all right
[30:55] what she said and God said behold I have
[30:58] given you ever herb bearing seed which
[31:00] is upon the face of the Earth and every
[31:03] tree in the midst in the which is the
[31:05] fruit of the tree yielding seed
[31:08] to you it shall be for me now that's
[31:10] while they were in the spiritual
[31:13] and God showing them that he was going
[31:16] to put them in the natural
[31:18] right
[31:20] they were in a spiritual condition which
[31:22] you did not need to eat
[31:25] right
[31:26] you don't eat in a theophany it's not
[31:28] you don't have to do that it's not dark
[31:30] all right but see knowing that then we
[31:33] see it and we understand what was taking
[31:36] place okay going to the next one number
[31:38] two which drops us up to Genesis 2 7
[31:41] because we know this spiritual man that
[31:44] was created
[31:47] all right
[31:49] then he was placed into natural flesh
[31:52] you know made created
[31:55] all right then Eve was taken from Adam
[31:57] and look what it says in the Lord God
[31:59] formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth
[32:01] and breathed into his nostrils the
[32:02] breath of life and he became a living
[32:04] soul
[32:05] all right we've seen from the prophet
[32:07] that that was eternal life
[32:09] breathe especially into Adam which went
[32:13] as we've studied and brought it in About
[32:15] Eve and how that she came forth with
[32:18] eternal life we gave the quotes you know
[32:20] to show him to what it's doing so
[32:23] anybody on the internet if you want
[32:24] these let us know
[32:26] all right but look and God Lord God
[32:29] formed
[32:31] now
[32:34] uh
[32:36] not spend too much time I guess
[32:39] I wish you would get down some days and
[32:42] get that down
[32:43] and understand that
[32:46] there's capital l o r d
[32:48] there's
[32:50] a lowercase
[32:52] that here
[32:54] you know back in the where is it I'm
[32:56] looking at scripture today and it says
[32:58] he
[33:00] talking about God
[33:03] brother Maloney he didn't like those
[33:05] terms because he is a
[33:08] you know is a pronoun
[33:11] instead of a noun
[33:13] and he didn't like the word he or it
[33:16] speaks in the Bible of the Holy Ghost
[33:18] and calls it an it
[33:20] well it can call him a he with little
[33:22] bitty letters
[33:24] but the only thing I've asked you to
[33:26] ever remember
[33:28] you remember that
[33:29] that when you see that little
[33:32] G the little L and it'll be in the same
[33:36] verse a lot of times
[33:39] remember one of them was speaking of the
[33:41] Great
[33:42] capital L O R D is the Lord God Of
[33:45] Heaven the other is speaking of the form
[33:47] that he moved himself down into to be
[33:50] able to reveal himself to hear
[33:52] that's just like in in the New Testament
[33:54] there when it says God is a spirit you
[33:56] say you got to start off a a sentence
[33:59] with a capital it doesn't start that
[34:01] with it with a great capital
[34:04] but over in Hebrews it says God in
[34:06] Sunday at times in diverse manner check
[34:08] that one out that's a great big old
[34:10] geode in a capital letter it means a lot
[34:13] maybe not to you but it does to me
[34:15] because in that way what I do is I look
[34:17] at it as to think about brother Branham
[34:21] standing out there
[34:22] and the great God of Glory descending to
[34:26] a human being
[34:28] are the prophets or the people
[34:31] and to see
[34:33] that they would call it Lord
[34:37] you go back and check where brother
[34:38] Randall says look at where there are of
[34:41] who is this male charity he said Abraham
[34:44] called him Lord
[34:46] me not just a little l-o-r-d the very
[34:50] capital l-o-r-d
[34:52] it means a lot see that's what I could
[34:55] have went through a lot of things but I
[34:56] just want to take verse by verse and
[34:58] just put it through
[34:59] but he said in the Lord God planted a
[35:01] garden Eastward in Eden and there he put
[35:03] the man whom he had formed now he's he's
[35:06] still in there he's not separated
[35:09] out of the ground
[35:11] made the Lord God to grow every tree
[35:13] that he promised while ago he would do
[35:16] when he would be put over you can eat of
[35:18] the the trees and the thing every tree
[35:20] that is Pleasant to the site and good
[35:22] for food the tree of life also in the
[35:25] midst of the garden watch and the tree
[35:28] of knowledge of Good and Evil
[35:31] now it's a funny looking tree
[35:34] why can't science figure out things
[35:37] why can't great Scholars read
[35:42] you know
[35:43] I mean it if
[35:46] if they can't see what took place it's
[35:49] because of their unbelief
[35:51] because it's a tree of knowledge of Good
[35:54] and Evil
[35:56] all right now the prophet said there was
[35:58] two trees in the garden
[36:01] they said the tree of life with Jesus
[36:02] Christ he said the tree of knowledge of
[36:05] Good and Evil he said that is Satan
[36:07] yep all right two trees
[36:10] you could have eaten of every tree now
[36:12] like I was saying the other day what if
[36:14] sin had not entered the picture
[36:16] then we could have come forth the way
[36:18] God had intended for it to come because
[36:20] why because the tree of life was in the
[36:22] garden
[36:24] and remember in a minute when we get on
[36:25] down to the scripture they were put out
[36:27] to keep them away from not just going in
[36:30] the garden
[36:31] but away from the Tree of Life
[36:33] all right
[36:34] you see then the tree of knowledge of
[36:36] Good and Evil if the tree of life is a
[36:39] person which is Christ
[36:41] didn't he say I'm the way the truth and
[36:43] the life
[36:44] all right
[36:45] see then Satan is trying his best to
[36:49] enter the human race
[36:51] some way right
[36:52] because he knows he's defeated the way
[36:55] he is and he's trying
[36:56] but he's a tree of knowledge and that's
[36:59] not an apple tree in a pear tree
[37:02] but they were actually told if you'll go
[37:04] back and study it they could eat of the
[37:07] trees
[37:08] that's what he started off we'll get to
[37:10] in a minute
[37:11] they could have aided the tree of life
[37:13] he said well I don't know about that
[37:15] well then God sure did goof up when he
[37:17] said put them out lest they partake of
[37:19] the tree of life but look how specific
[37:21] we'll get to it in a minute
[37:24] he said put them out lest they partake
[37:26] of the tree of life and live forever
[37:30] he didn't use the word eternal life
[37:33] he used forever because you can't be in
[37:36] it for an eternal sinner all right just
[37:39] the points that we've not used along the
[37:41] way all right the tree of life was in
[37:43] the midst of the garden and the tree of
[37:45] knowledge of Good and Evil
[37:47] all right Christ was there
[37:50] but so was Satan
[37:52] all right so it wasn't two apple trees
[37:55] or you know one walked up naughty
[37:57] looking tree and one good one or
[37:59] whatever you know or some pomegranates
[38:01] or whatever it had to be something else
[38:04] and being that then look what it was all
[38:09] right two trees
[38:14] jump on over we got two verse 9 going up
[38:16] I'm leaving a few scriptures out because
[38:18] they're not taking so much verse 16 and
[38:21] the Lord God commanded the man
[38:24] saying
[38:25] of every tree now this is before Eve was
[38:28] created
[38:30] you know physically before she came into
[38:33] flesh he's speaking just directly to
[38:34] Adam
[38:35] of every tree of the garden I may ask
[38:37] freely eat but of the tree of the
[38:39] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[38:41] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[38:43] eatest thereof thy shall surely die now
[38:47] you can think what you like but I
[38:49] believe that Adam had a great knowledge
[38:54] I don't think he was worried about Eve
[38:56] climbing up into a crab apple tree and
[39:00] biting off some bit or something or a
[39:03] prune or a you know
[39:06] I think he may be understood
[39:09] a little things
[39:11] you know because he would probably as I
[39:14] said one day tell Eve said eve it's not
[39:16] time
[39:20] it's all right you put what you want to
[39:22] but listen
[39:24] but of the tree of the knowledge of Good
[39:26] and Evil
[39:30] don't eat it
[39:32] don't touch it
[39:35] because you'll die
[39:39] you see like brother Ernie makes the the
[39:42] illustration where the Villanueva you
[39:44] know that they put on aprons to cover
[39:47] their nakedness
[39:49] well if it was Apple you should have put
[39:52] one over the mouth and and put you on
[39:54] some mittens on your hand you know to
[39:56] cover that part of just apples and
[39:58] things
[40:00] but yet see we know those things now and
[40:03] we know the truth
[40:05] because we never thought about these
[40:07] things until the Prophet come to bring
[40:09] us the message
[40:10] we read the Bible and we could pick out
[40:13] certain things because I used to read of
[40:16] the writers as much as I could and I
[40:18] enjoyed Scofield and and a lot of his
[40:21] writings and a lot of schofield's
[40:23] writings are true
[40:24] but after finding the truth of the
[40:27] message of the hour we can put a little
[40:28] X across that one and say that's not
[40:30] right you know but yet he still had
[40:33] truth on a lot of things
[40:35] you know he knows if you're reading your
[40:38] your Scofield bible right down in his
[40:40] footnotes about the Beast that he knows
[40:42] that that was not a snake but it was
[40:45] made a snake he says it you know he he
[40:49] knows that part
[40:51] because that's that was the
[40:52] understanding because he said it's not
[40:54] to be taken like a snake but it says an
[40:56] upright creature all right
[40:59] but see the knowledge tree of knowledge
[41:02] but around and said they could take a
[41:04] tree take a bite off of the tree of life
[41:06] and he said you can live forever
[41:09] but he said you take a bite off the tree
[41:11] of knowledge of Good and Evil and he
[41:13] said it'll destroy you every time
[41:16] he said that's what science is doing is
[41:18] eating off of the tree of knowledge
[41:21] amen
[41:23] and the Bible says you know there's
[41:24] nothing withholding from the imagination
[41:26] of man's mind
[41:28] you know what he could think of he could
[41:30] bring out a lot of you ain't old enough
[41:32] to remember going to the old movies and
[41:35] things in the in the late 40s and you
[41:39] know and seeing Buck Rogers
[41:42] as interplanatory travel in a spaceship
[41:45] with ray guns
[41:46] well it wasn't even thought of
[41:49] hardly back there in the scientific
[41:51] Realm
[41:53] and then from that time of the 40s to
[41:56] the 90s we went to the Moon
[41:59] you know because that's the tree of
[42:01] knowledge of Good and Evil remember it
[42:04] is good
[42:05] I like air conditioning
[42:08] I like heat
[42:09] I like to ride in a good car
[42:12] you know right
[42:14] we were life in today then at the
[42:16] hospital and and uh sister Brenda was
[42:19] saying something about some shoes I said
[42:21] yep
[42:22] my time we had one power that lasted all
[42:24] year
[42:26] and I said that was your Sundays and
[42:28] your all during the week time you know
[42:30] was that one pair of shoes you didn't
[42:33] have two power and you'd you know you
[42:36] went barefooted until it got frost and
[42:39] then we were in swimming but time we got
[42:41] hit the month of March and and you know
[42:44] and things like that and running without
[42:46] her shoes because we knew we were going
[42:48] to wire them out and we didn't have any
[42:50] you know because that was just life
[42:54] as we lived but all right but listen
[42:59] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[43:02] I didn't spend much time on that having
[43:04] it so I want to just drop a point or two
[43:11] do you realize this message
[43:15] as Paul said to let her killeth
[43:18] this message without the Holy Spirit to
[43:21] reveal it will destroy you
[43:23] exactly
[43:26] all right amen
[43:29] amen without the Revelation it will
[43:31] destroy us
[43:33] even though you can quote everything
[43:34] amen
[43:37] amen and say well here's the scriptures
[43:39] here's the things I got it written down
[43:40] I know what was said if that's not
[43:42] revealed
[43:45] then where are we
[43:49] do you understand what I'm trying to
[43:51] illustrate
[43:52] that this message without a revelation
[43:54] is part of the tree of knowledge of Good
[43:57] and Evil
[43:58] I ain't talking about what happened back
[44:00] in the garden I ain't talking about all
[44:01] that I'm talking about the plain truth
[44:04] of the Bible
[44:06] that this message will do nothing but
[44:08] destroy you
[44:11] you know
[44:12] I really enjoyed what Wade had to say
[44:14] about the the where they knew they would
[44:16] run up that on the uh the people you
[44:19] know in that Mr Expo would be texting
[44:21] and running up brother Branham and and
[44:23] getting all of the first ones are the
[44:25] real bad things you know and he gave
[44:28] them an illustration you know that that
[44:30] they didn't agree too much with John the
[44:32] Baptist back in the days of their
[44:34] computers and uh you know they didn't
[44:36] agree with the Lord Jesus because they
[44:38] took him out and killed him you know
[44:40] because of their doing but see that was
[44:42] the tree of knowledge
[44:46] because lest
[44:48] we be beguiled as Eve was through his
[44:52] septility
[44:55] I wish to God I had revealed in my heart
[44:59] what is In My Head by knowledge
[45:03] I don't claim to have it revealed all of
[45:06] it
[45:06] but I do claim one thing I will be glad
[45:09] to discuss anything that's been revealed
[45:12] to me now some of the things that hadn't
[45:14] been revealed it's going to be my
[45:15] opinion and yours
[45:17] no brother I've got the profit
[45:20] well okay
[45:22] that's the tree of knowledge
[45:24] because this knowledge is what's killing
[45:27] us
[45:29] destroying the people with knowledge
[45:34] right
[45:37] you see why I try to preach by
[45:38] Revelation to get you to see it where I
[45:41] was listening today coming back home to
[45:43] brother Branham where he was talking
[45:44] about how he said I've tried my best to
[45:46] get to Branham Tabernacle to get away
[45:49] from just being little kids
[45:52] let's grow up
[45:54] you know
[45:55] he said because that's been my desire
[45:58] to see the church grow in what in Grace
[46:01] and knowledge
[46:03] you know that knowledge is on the
[46:05] pyramid
[46:07] but now that's not the tree of knowledge
[46:09] there
[46:10] that's Holy Ghost revealed knowledge
[46:13] the Holy Ghost reveal knowledge will not
[46:15] destroy us
[46:17] it will carry us forth
[46:19] and that's why I keep pounding on a half
[46:22] for 50 years now about this message
[46:25] because I believe this message is is the
[46:28] part that we need revealed
[46:31] all right
[46:32] that's why I fought so hard to try to
[46:34] keep the truth in this little building
[46:37] to the bases that you know I could have
[46:40] been very popular and accepted among a
[46:42] lot of the things but I don't want
[46:45] popularity I want the reveal truth
[46:49] regardless I've got to walk by myself I
[46:52] will walk by myself in it because that
[46:55] is my goal and my desire
[46:58] and I'll you know and everybody says
[47:00] well that's my desire too well all right
[47:02] let's go let's sit down and talk about
[47:04] the word
[47:05] you know we were listening what was last
[47:07] night where brother Branham was today I
[47:10] was listening because I hear in good
[47:11] many take where he's talking about that
[47:14] your experiencing this today on on the
[47:17] Hebrew series one he said
[47:20] you know people would ever put
[47:22] everything on an experience
[47:26] he said I don't put it on an experience
[47:31] he said I put it on the word
[47:35] because see you can take your experience
[47:37] and do anything
[47:41] like the Bible says Judas went and hung
[47:44] himself and you go do likewise that's
[47:45] two scriptures but that is the word of
[47:47] God
[47:49] huh
[47:51] but you see why that we are eating a lot
[47:53] of time off the tree of knowledge
[47:58] even though we're reading the Bible
[48:03] and saying the Bible said it
[48:05] right
[48:07] how many of us believed in a trinity
[48:08] don't raise your hand just remember it
[48:12] how many of us believe hell was eternal
[48:14] how many of us believed all of these
[48:16] things until we heard of the message
[48:19] well we swore by it didn't we before the
[48:22] Bible said it
[48:25] will come find out that wouldn't want it
[48:27] was saying that's what I'm talking about
[48:28] you shall know the truth
[48:33] you shall know the truth and the truth
[48:35] will set you free revealed word is what
[48:37] I'm talking about
[48:40] revealed word is to truth to me
[48:42] you say we've got the truth
[48:45] all right the brothers you know they're
[48:46] good about doing it say well you put
[48:48] this one out here and you line up with
[48:50] that and that back here well that's real
[48:52] good
[48:54] and I understand what they're talking
[48:56] about and I understand but around them
[48:58] and lining up but also understand what
[49:00] he says he said if you move one Higher
[49:05] he's a shooter of guns at hundreds of
[49:07] yards or an eye out of a squirrel
[49:10] at 50 yards that he would not even shoot
[49:12] if he couldn't do that
[49:14] you move it one Higher
[49:18] in a hundred yards you can miss a long
[49:21] ways
[49:22] so holding it up so we got it lined up
[49:25] well you know the way I've got this
[49:27] holding it I'm holding it because I
[49:29] can't just stand the paper up well this
[49:31] is doing pretty good but I got that one
[49:32] bent to hold it now where am I going to
[49:35] shoot
[49:37] I can't illustrate it that way to the
[49:39] Natural where am I going to hit
[49:42] but we got the word
[49:44] the revealed word is the only thing
[49:46] that's worth anything
[49:48] I don't care what you think I don't care
[49:50] what I think
[49:51] I care what is revealed all right now
[49:54] that's what he was saying about an
[49:56] experience if you get something that's
[49:58] revealed to you
[50:01] that is your experience that's the
[50:03] experience I want then you can have all
[50:06] of the manifestation of gifts and signs
[50:08] and wonders are wonderful
[50:10] but if it don't agree with the word
[50:15] yeah but the Lord told me
[50:21] what does this say what does the prophet
[50:23] say
[50:26] this is what the Lord said I don't care
[50:28] what me and you think about it let's see
[50:30] if we could get hung up in a lot of
[50:31] things and stay a long time all right
[50:33] but let's move on where'd we get to
[50:36] pull up number three
[50:39] about Genesis 2 16 17 but we'll go to 20
[50:42] where we want to go to
[50:44] and watch what it says and Adam gave
[50:46] names to all cattles into the fall of
[50:49] the iron to every beast of the field but
[50:51] to Adam there was not found and helped
[50:53] meat for him now remember it doesn't say
[50:55] mate says meat because meat is more
[50:58] closer to togetherness
[51:00] whereas mate can signify just two men or
[51:04] whatever you're talking about so the
[51:05] word is perfect Lord God calls and and
[51:08] you'd be surprised how many people quote
[51:10] that
[51:11] is m-a-t-e
[51:15] even though the Bible says in me too
[51:17] and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[51:20] fall upon Adam and he slept and he took
[51:21] one of his ribs and closed up the Flesh
[51:23] and stood thereof and the rib which the
[51:25] Lord God had taken from man made he a
[51:28] woman and brought her unto the man
[51:31] now remember what brother Branham said
[51:33] of what we were bringing out in the
[51:35] stories we were coming through that
[51:38] there was no help meet for Adam and
[51:40] brother and said he was lonely
[51:45] now he was in flesh in the garden
[51:46] leading the animals and and doing all
[51:49] the things but said he was lonely there
[51:51] was no help meet for him
[51:54] if you remember what he said
[51:57] he said because part of him was still in
[52:00] theophany
[52:04] and said that would make him lonely
[52:07] because part of him was in theosomy and
[52:09] part of him was in flesh all right that
[52:13] part that was in theophany was Eve right
[52:17] all right
[52:19] you see Eve then finally was separated
[52:21] after the rib situation and they're
[52:23] bringing forth and she was brought out
[52:26] of Adam
[52:29] and placed in a flesh and called woman
[52:34] see now you'd be surprised how many of
[52:36] us will say and she was called Eve and
[52:38] we know what we're talking about that's
[52:40] sensible but the Bible doesn't call her
[52:42] that
[52:43] the Bible called her woman
[52:45] because that's what she is she comes
[52:47] from man
[52:48] she did not get the name Eve until the
[52:50] fall
[52:51] because we'll get to that in a minute
[52:53] Eve means the mother of all living we'll
[52:55] see it this situation she was not
[52:58] so her name was not Eve her name was
[53:00] woman
[53:01] now brother Maloney used to try to
[53:03] explain that in the Hebrew Greek or
[53:05] whatever to me and and I could see what
[53:08] he's talking about but I didn't
[53:09] understand those things uh but he said
[53:12] that the word woman means
[53:15] that a man has a wound
[53:18] you know a w-o OMB
[53:20] not meaning he's a mixed up pervert but
[53:24] when it happened with
[53:26] Adam and Eve coming from Adam then there
[53:30] was an ability brought forth to
[53:33] reproduce Adam
[53:35] so it was really would mean
[53:38] a man with a wound
[53:40] need to bring forth
[53:42] all right and I thought well that's good
[53:44] that's I don't know but you know but he
[53:48] made a woman and brought her unto the
[53:49] man and said this is now bone of my
[53:51] bones and Flesh of My Flesh
[53:53] Who Shall be Called woman and that's why
[53:55] I argue so much or hollering screaming
[53:57] to people about the byproduct the
[53:59] byproduct I know marriage and divorce I
[54:01] know what he said I know where he used
[54:03] the word byproduct
[54:04] but I know a lot of other things he used
[54:06] to buy products about this people don't
[54:08] want you to read
[54:10] word that God didn't go somewhere else
[54:14] that he took from Adam in the original
[54:17] creation
[54:19] Now Eve was in Adam in the original
[54:21] creation right
[54:25] I guess he just decided a while well
[54:27] that rib right there looks like I'll use
[54:29] that rib no no
[54:31] Eve was in Adam
[54:34] they were even told to multiply and
[54:37] replenish the Earth while in their
[54:38] spiritual condition
[54:41] okay
[54:43] see we're learning the truth that can
[54:45] take away the questions
[54:49] or should you know
[54:51] but she's made a woman and brought her
[54:53] into the man and said and she shall be
[54:55] called woman
[54:57] because she was taken out of man
[55:00] all right therefore shall a man leave
[55:01] his father and his mother and shall
[55:04] cleave unto his wife and they shall be
[55:06] one flesh
[55:07] that's what marriage is supposed to
[55:09] bring unto us
[55:11] a situation of one flesh
[55:15] and the way you treat your flesh
[55:20] yeah
[55:22] I mean that that woman is part of you
[55:27] know I guess the situation develops it
[55:30] we think we didn't get the right flesh
[55:32] so I need to go out and try to find my
[55:34] other part
[55:35] you know that don't work too good either
[55:38] but that's what mankind thinks
[55:42] well it is it to the point that we think
[55:44] well she just flushed and I'm the great
[55:48] and
[55:49] no supposed to be one
[55:53] a man and wife is supposed to be one
[55:58] loving and kindness to each other
[56:02] right
[56:04] not hateful and you know me I get too
[56:07] much okay
[56:08] all right let's drop on over
[56:11] just reading a few scriptures
[56:14] jump on over to
[56:16] we'll start in Genesis 3.
[56:22] I don't think we need to spend a lot of
[56:24] time explaining the literal act in the
[56:28] garden
[56:29] as much as we spend upon the time of the
[56:33] spiritual condition
[56:34] and the the uh what caused Eve to go
[56:37] wrong in her spirit
[56:39] in her memory reason conscience
[56:42] affections whether you want to call it
[56:44] Soul or whether you want to call it
[56:46] spirit it's always in the memory reason
[56:49] conscience and affections but see that
[56:52] takes away a lot of things from me to
[56:54] just know that you know brother Branham
[56:58] did explain
[56:59] Body Spirit and soul you know at one he
[57:01] spent it Body Soul spirit and then later
[57:04] he would come and say Body Spirit and
[57:07] soul that would be bringing together
[57:10] things in the word of God that you're
[57:13] you're too Soul people and all of those
[57:15] people use those quotes
[57:18] you know of a quote in in the 50s
[57:23] but they didn't want nothing after the
[57:25] 50s
[57:26] you know I told him one of them one time
[57:29] I said well
[57:30] you know you're talking about
[57:32] Soul being the nature of this period I
[57:34] said brother said on
[57:37] on souls in prison that the nature of
[57:39] your soul is God if you're born again if
[57:41] not it's of the world he said how can a
[57:43] nature be a nature I remember you
[57:45] standing right there in front of the old
[57:48] voice of God Recordings
[57:50] I said I don't know why don't you ask
[57:51] him
[57:54] is he because he wasn't going to listen
[57:56] to anything you can take brother Ryan's
[57:59] message and make it say anything you
[58:01] wanted to say
[58:03] but if you take the message now the
[58:06] letter of the page is you can do it but
[58:09] you take the message and it won't
[58:10] declare nothing but Jesus Christ the
[58:12] same yesterday today and forever
[58:13] remember
[58:15] where I was quoting a while ago where
[58:17] brought around said that this eve would
[58:19] not fail he said the first original Eve
[58:22] was he was deceived on Hebrews 13 8.
[58:28] yeah you said well he didn't even know
[58:30] Hebrews 13 now she didn't believe him to
[58:32] be what he was either
[58:34] all right but think about it
[58:37] the serpent was more subtle so we know
[58:39] at the time that we're getting to that
[58:42] Eve had already been removed from Adam
[58:44] things has been taken and made and
[58:47] they're there in the garden all right
[58:49] then we know now see the serpent was
[58:51] more subtle than any Beast
[58:53] now we know that there's a difference
[58:54] between a serpent and a beast
[58:56] and we know that he was a beast upright
[58:58] walking around because the Bible says
[59:01] that we don't have time to get to it
[59:03] that upon thy belly shalt thou crawl so
[59:07] we went some other way before then so it
[59:10] was an upright Beast he was made a
[59:12] serpent by the curse
[59:14] that was placed upon the Beast because
[59:17] of of what happened all right and he
[59:19] said unto the woman you have yeah hath
[59:22] God said You shall not eat of every tree
[59:24] of the garden
[59:26] and like I said if she'd went and said
[59:28] Okay hold it this is beyond me
[59:32] now what did Brother random explain
[59:36] he said now if you come up to a question
[59:39] about something sisters and says you're
[59:42] talking to somebody said
[59:44] um paraphrasing it but it's pretty close
[59:46] said the thing to do is say now wait
[59:50] just a minute I need for you to talk to
[59:52] my husband or my pastor
[59:55] you know
[59:56] because see she was you know he's saying
[59:59] you're you're going to get caught
[1:00:01] because the Bible says she's a thousand
[1:00:02] times easier deceived
[1:00:04] you know than the man
[1:00:06] and he approached her remember how we're
[1:00:08] bringing it out he approached her and
[1:00:10] she began to preach to him
[1:00:12] she's a good woman preacher he began to
[1:00:14] preach to him
[1:00:16] well her first sermon should have been
[1:00:17] Hebrews 13 8.
[1:00:20] at her first sermon in Hebrews 13 8 it
[1:00:23] would have ended the whole rest of the
[1:00:24] situation
[1:00:26] so you see why she doubted it and got to
[1:00:28] that point which says we may eat or the
[1:00:30] fruit of the trees or the garden
[1:00:34] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:00:36] the midst of the garden God has said You
[1:00:39] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[1:00:41] touch it lest you die
[1:00:46] she began to explain to him the word
[1:00:52] right
[1:00:55] men women are preachers
[1:00:58] may I put it that way all right
[1:01:01] I was with a brother in a certain place
[1:01:03] one time and
[1:01:05] he was answering questions
[1:01:09] I saw immediately that they had him
[1:01:11] pinned
[1:01:12] and uh
[1:01:14] you know
[1:01:16] but it was his
[1:01:18] presentation it wasn't mine
[1:01:21] but I've seen immediately as he began to
[1:01:24] squirm and draw up a little bit and Stam
[1:01:27] her around
[1:01:28] and uh he kept looking over towards me I
[1:01:31] said would you like for me to take it
[1:01:34] he said I certainly wish he would
[1:01:37] well because see I knew the answers that
[1:01:40] they needed
[1:01:41] in the word of God
[1:01:43] but my point is
[1:01:46] it's hard to get preachers to depend
[1:01:48] upon preachers
[1:01:49] you know
[1:01:53] well
[1:01:54] I know I get in trouble with my mouth
[1:01:56] but have you ever thought about a woman
[1:01:59] preacher
[1:02:03] have you ever thought about a man with a
[1:02:05] woman preacher spirit
[1:02:10] that makes you think don't it brother
[1:02:12] boy a woman with I mean a man with a
[1:02:15] woman's preacher it means you're
[1:02:17] perverted
[1:02:20] it means the inability to receive and
[1:02:22] accept the truth
[1:02:26] so then you're right back where Eve was
[1:02:29] all right see that's what we could have
[1:02:30] went through on a lot of it but we chose
[1:02:32] not to using it a little bit tonight we
[1:02:35] may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[1:02:36] garden with the fruit of the tree which
[1:02:37] is in the midst of the garden God has
[1:02:39] said You shall not eat of it neither
[1:02:41] shall ye touch it
[1:02:43] lest you die
[1:02:45] if it's just eating you've got a problem
[1:02:46] there because you ain't supposed to
[1:02:48] touch it either all right
[1:02:50] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[1:02:53] shall not surely die because we say you
[1:02:55] know it's not to it around him would say
[1:02:58] see he added only one word and see
[1:03:00] you've got two or three words changing
[1:03:02] but it means the same it means where she
[1:03:05] said ye shall not uh he said You shall
[1:03:08] not surely die she said we shall die
[1:03:10] all right and it's doing it but now look
[1:03:13] God doesn't know that in the day you eat
[1:03:14] thereof then your eyes shall be opened
[1:03:16] and you shall be as Gods knowing good
[1:03:19] and evil remember it's a tree of
[1:03:21] knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:03:23] all right
[1:03:25] and the Wonder Woman saw that the tree
[1:03:27] was good for food that's where we lock
[1:03:29] down on that part and that it was
[1:03:31] pleasant to the eyes now watch though
[1:03:34] and a tree to be desired to make one
[1:03:37] wise
[1:03:40] even if we went with the actual Act
[1:03:43] that we believe the sex act that took
[1:03:46] place in the garden between Eve and the
[1:03:47] Beast how would it be something to make
[1:03:49] you white wise
[1:03:57] yeah all right
[1:03:59] she took of the fruit in our oven did he
[1:04:01] even gave also unto her husband with her
[1:04:04] and he did eat
[1:04:05] and their eyes were open and they were
[1:04:07] there the eyes of them both were opened
[1:04:11] and they knew that they were naked
[1:04:15] and they sold what fig leaves
[1:04:18] all right
[1:04:19] and what happened
[1:04:22] and made themselves aprons
[1:04:24] now you know what wrote around said
[1:04:26] about thick legs he said that's a
[1:04:27] religion
[1:04:29] but have you ever thought about why it
[1:04:31] says fig leaves
[1:04:39] because any fig that I've ever seen I
[1:04:41] know over and Israel will have thick
[1:04:42] trees we have thick bushes
[1:04:45] but in Israel they have fig trees I mean
[1:04:47] they're tall trees the one we saw it
[1:04:50] though uh
[1:04:53] foreign
[1:05:00] the one we saw there was a tree about
[1:05:02] maybe yay big around and probably 30 40
[1:05:04] foot high
[1:05:06] but any of them I've ever seen has the
[1:05:08] same form about them
[1:05:09] the leaves are really uh scratchy
[1:05:16] why would you want to put on a fig leaf
[1:05:22] why didn't they take a maple
[1:05:24] or an oak
[1:05:27] or popular
[1:05:29] or a uh one of them things in their
[1:05:32] swamps uh Palmetto
[1:05:35] uh you know why don't you take some kind
[1:05:37] of big old Leaf thing to put it on
[1:05:40] you know it took a little time to sit
[1:05:41] there and sew together even though you
[1:05:43] make a small maybe but they put fig
[1:05:45] leaves
[1:05:48] isn't it odd have you never considered
[1:05:50] the point that Eve still being the woman
[1:05:52] preacher that she was still anointed
[1:05:56] because brother Brown said your religion
[1:05:57] is your covering
[1:06:01] and he said they made them a covering
[1:06:04] you ever thought about Israel being
[1:06:05] called a fig tree
[1:06:12] might have been a little bit better
[1:06:13] understanding back there than what we
[1:06:15] think
[1:06:18] that it was a fig tree and Israel is
[1:06:19] called a fig tree not called an apple
[1:06:21] tree a pomegranate or
[1:06:26] maybe she had a little understanding
[1:06:31] remember she wasn't uh a dummy
[1:06:38] okay
[1:06:40] up to you
[1:06:42] they heard the voice
[1:06:44] now you'll have to take this one his
[1:06:47] brother Brian saying it
[1:06:49] because he said it like this
[1:06:51] he said see they were back in the bushes
[1:06:54] having Church
[1:06:57] remember that one right they were back
[1:07:00] in the bushes having Church
[1:07:02] with their fig leaves on
[1:07:06] see they thought they had the covering
[1:07:10] right their thought their religion was
[1:07:13] okay
[1:07:16] and watch it
[1:07:18] and they thought everything was all
[1:07:19] right and they were having Church
[1:07:23] now what would you be doing having
[1:07:24] Church
[1:07:29] no
[1:07:30] he's still preaching
[1:07:35] right
[1:07:39] you just didn't tell me
[1:07:43] you didn't tell me the whole story
[1:07:44] I remember when we were in theophany
[1:07:46] that God said multiply and replenished
[1:07:49] here said the Beast just explained how
[1:07:51] that was to take place
[1:07:56] she brought around me I quote him she
[1:07:59] was deceived the Bible said she was but
[1:08:03] said Adam was not
[1:08:05] when Adam loved her
[1:08:08] now think about it
[1:08:11] brother Tatum I used to get to tickle at
[1:08:13] him he used to go around to a lot of the
[1:08:15] meetings which he was in some of the
[1:08:17] different ones but he'd tell about old
[1:08:19] Jack Cole he was pretty rough about his
[1:08:22] wording in doing and uh he he just took
[1:08:26] somebody's glasses off and he's going to
[1:08:28] pray for her he'd take glass off just
[1:08:29] stomp him
[1:08:31] let's crush him somebody come up with
[1:08:33] got a cancer in my stomach he just hit
[1:08:35] him as hard as he can hit him right in
[1:08:36] the stomach he said go on you'll be all
[1:08:38] right said blood just squirt praise the
[1:08:39] Lord healed
[1:08:44] we said Sometimes some of those people
[1:08:45] would use a little bit of discernment
[1:08:48] and call out things and brother Brown
[1:08:50] and remember in his early days did a lot
[1:08:51] of that and he said he felt checked and
[1:08:54] didn't do it as much
[1:08:57] my point
[1:08:59] think about it
[1:09:00] Adam and Eve was going to church having
[1:09:03] a good time
[1:09:05] done got it figured out they wasn't as
[1:09:07] bad off as they thought they were
[1:09:12] they had them in good covering
[1:09:14] until God Walked In The Crowd
[1:09:18] when God walked close to their Church
[1:09:21] they got afraid
[1:09:25] brother Branham and some of them Jack
[1:09:26] Cole to call them out so you're running
[1:09:28] around there's no hear nothing's running
[1:09:29] around that
[1:09:30] in
[1:09:33] but around said I quit he said cause
[1:09:35] that can cause death
[1:09:37] you know
[1:09:40] but my point is
[1:09:42] our religion a lot of times is pretty
[1:09:45] good
[1:09:47] until we face the truth
[1:09:56] let me say it this way
[1:09:58] why did those
[1:10:01] 42 children
[1:10:04] get killed
[1:10:09] because they were out making fun of
[1:10:12] oh bald head right
[1:10:14] well you know where they got that from
[1:10:16] was Mom and Daddy sitting at the table
[1:10:20] talking about old bald heads
[1:10:23] why don't you just go on up forget it
[1:10:27] and you know what the kids begin to talk
[1:10:29] about it you know whose fault it is a
[1:10:31] lot of times about our kids and the way
[1:10:34] we say things
[1:10:35] you know it's our fault
[1:10:38] you know that a lot of you on the way
[1:10:39] home sometimes are talking about you
[1:10:41] didn't agree exactly what brother Dale
[1:10:43] and you know what your kids are laying
[1:10:45] in the back listening to you
[1:10:47] oh
[1:10:56] no okay
[1:10:58] see our religion is okay
[1:11:01] another random fuel to read just keep
[1:11:03] reading something you hear him
[1:11:05] explaining and said you know
[1:11:08] they had a good religion
[1:11:11] but this is his wording
[1:11:15] he said religion is okay
[1:11:18] but said it will not save you you need
[1:11:21] that quote I got it laying right over
[1:11:23] here
[1:11:24] religion won't save you
[1:11:28] so that was Adam and Eve rejoicing look
[1:11:30] at the world today rejoicing over their
[1:11:32] religion
[1:11:34] and what are they doing feeding the poor
[1:11:36] sending money to the world
[1:11:39] I'm looking at the paper today where
[1:11:40] they've taken up for overseas or they're
[1:11:42] not even religious but you know I'm sure
[1:11:44] mohammedans and religious people three
[1:11:47] point something billion dollars that
[1:11:48] they'd already made up to send to some
[1:11:50] country
[1:11:53] and see we're just sending millions of
[1:11:55] billions of dollars a year
[1:11:58] to feed the poor and all like that
[1:12:01] and thinking that's going to get us to
[1:12:03] heaven
[1:12:05] you ever notice nobody goes to hell
[1:12:07] anymore you don't hear any preachers say
[1:12:09] that
[1:12:10] I had Brothers a good brother
[1:12:13] he put two dollars an offer and play
[1:12:16] well
[1:12:19] all right religion what do we got
[1:12:21] religion or salvation
[1:12:24] me
[1:12:25] all right well see salvation will keep
[1:12:28] you and listen
[1:12:32] you are not afraid
[1:12:36] why did Brothers say it like this he
[1:12:38] said you're to see the faces on those
[1:12:40] people
[1:12:41] when they know they're going to be
[1:12:44] exposed
[1:12:54] what about it
[1:12:56] do we have religion or do we have
[1:12:58] salvation
[1:13:01] this message is religion
[1:13:08] without it being revealed that's all it
[1:13:10] is
[1:13:11] it's a covering
[1:13:13] no more than any other organized
[1:13:15] religion
[1:13:18] well you're not talking like that about
[1:13:19] is it the truth
[1:13:22] have I become your enemy because I tell
[1:13:24] you the truth about it
[1:13:26] you know what I'm getting at I'm not
[1:13:28] thrown off on the message I spent half
[1:13:30] the service of bragging about what we
[1:13:32] had to because of us
[1:13:36] happy but when it comes down to it is it
[1:13:39] just quotes and ideas
[1:13:43] can you explain
[1:13:46] your
[1:13:50] revelation
[1:13:52] without having to quote brother random
[1:13:55] and I don't mean that you don't quote
[1:13:56] wrote a random because that's all right
[1:13:58] I'm just asking you could you do it like
[1:14:01] wading them was having to do it with
[1:14:02] Ernest Brothers is going to convince
[1:14:04] them that the Bible shows that Elijah's
[1:14:07] coming shows all these great things that
[1:14:09] are happening without bringing brother
[1:14:11] Brown's name into it
[1:14:13] until they bring them up to the date and
[1:14:15] the times and get them in you know into
[1:14:19] thinking
[1:14:20] of what the Bible say is the truth
[1:14:23] man you know they didn't know the Bible
[1:14:26] said that 10 years ago or something like
[1:14:29] that
[1:14:30] but it didn't change the Bible
[1:14:33] you know that brother Brown didn't have
[1:14:35] no books to quote
[1:14:36] right amen you know what I mean he
[1:14:39] quoted a lot of books a lot of brother
[1:14:41] Brown's things as quotes out of books he
[1:14:43] was a well-read man
[1:14:45] now when you're talking about reading
[1:14:47] about what is it the uh Macbeth and
[1:14:50] things like that I ain't never read
[1:14:51] nothing about MacBeth and don't care
[1:14:53] nothing about it but he evidently had
[1:14:55] read some about it because he knows some
[1:14:57] things about it
[1:14:58] you know all right well read okay you
[1:15:01] know
[1:15:03] but look
[1:15:06] now let's take that verse 8.
[1:15:09] and their divorce of the Lord God
[1:15:10] Walking In The Garden in the cool of the
[1:15:12] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[1:15:15] from the presence of the Lord God were
[1:15:22] amongst the Trees of the garden now
[1:15:24] physically we've got a little sense okay
[1:15:26] we got a little sins okay
[1:15:29] there were a lot of trees there and they
[1:15:30] had their church over the bushes because
[1:15:33] it's free to come out
[1:15:35] all right but what about the trees
[1:15:42] that's when God had to run him out he
[1:15:44] said cause that partake of that tree of
[1:15:45] life
[1:15:46] and they they was getting very close
[1:15:50] right
[1:15:52] getting very close
[1:15:54] thinking about how good it would be and
[1:15:55] what it is and what's going on
[1:15:58] all right amongst the trees
[1:16:01] well you know if those trees were
[1:16:05] trees alone as the Bible says which is
[1:16:07] talking about man
[1:16:10] as John was seeing it
[1:16:12] uh
[1:16:15] I wonder if we was back there
[1:16:17] kind of hanging around in the bushes
[1:16:23] get off come on
[1:16:25] Lord God called unto Adam and said unto
[1:16:27] him where art thou now brother Branham
[1:16:29] said
[1:16:31] he didn't know where Adam was
[1:16:34] he said or why else would he call or
[1:16:37] aren't they
[1:16:38] now we said with the omnipotent
[1:16:43] the omnipotent God knows everything okay
[1:16:46] I'll be glad I'm glad you thought of
[1:16:48] that
[1:16:49] because that brings me back to where I
[1:16:50] was while ago
[1:16:52] this l-o-r-d when it's capitalized he
[1:16:56] knows all things
[1:17:05] this Lord God
[1:17:08] Lord knowing all things
[1:17:11] but then it puts God with it
[1:17:14] in a little form or middle case
[1:17:20] because that way God that part doesn't
[1:17:23] know everything
[1:17:27] now brother Brown I'm like come on you
[1:17:28] got a quote he said Jesus didn't know
[1:17:31] everything he said God father didn't
[1:17:33] reveal it to him
[1:17:35] okay
[1:17:38] you understand what I mean that's the
[1:17:40] reason it'll use those lower cases a lot
[1:17:42] of times because it means God can
[1:17:44] actually be down here with you and I
[1:17:46] fellowship and right here and sin can be
[1:17:49] right over there and him not know it
[1:17:52] but he could know you and what you're
[1:17:54] doing
[1:17:58] right
[1:18:00] see because he lowers himself in another
[1:18:03] form
[1:18:06] you want to call it an angel it's okay
[1:18:09] because the Bible will say the angel of
[1:18:11] the Lord
[1:18:14] and Abraham was called him Angel the
[1:18:16] Lord said it was God all right
[1:18:19] but he said warrant thou
[1:18:24] and he said I heard thy voice in the
[1:18:26] garden and I was afraid
[1:18:28] because I was naked and I hid myself now
[1:18:31] the religion will hold you
[1:18:33] Adam you're in the presence of God
[1:18:37] won't hold you
[1:18:45] people will walk away from the presence
[1:18:48] of a real god-called person
[1:18:51] women men
[1:18:52] istors whatever
[1:18:56] they'll walk away from you and talk
[1:18:58] about you
[1:19:00] but they won't talk while they're in
[1:19:02] front of you people notice that
[1:19:07] could it be they know better than to
[1:19:09] talk while they're in your presence
[1:19:13] but when you get away from you
[1:19:15] you know
[1:19:19] I'm in the Lord Jesus down there and
[1:19:20] raised the Dead and oh man hey oh yeah
[1:19:24] we're Believers because it's not where
[1:19:25] we started with it and many believed
[1:19:31] but as quick as they got to their self
[1:19:32] they quit believing him
[1:19:35] right see we think our religion will
[1:19:38] cover us but just remember it's got
[1:19:41] holes in it
[1:19:49] why did he say I because I was naked
[1:19:54] you know
[1:19:58] it had to have something to do with the
[1:20:01] Mankind and his doings and we know what
[1:20:04] that means and what took place see when
[1:20:07] they engaged in the act that they did
[1:20:09] then they become naked
[1:20:13] they didn't know they were naked until
[1:20:14] then
[1:20:16] that's the part of knowing the Good and
[1:20:19] Evil
[1:20:20] right
[1:20:21] and he said who told me that thou was
[1:20:23] naked
[1:20:28] now God asked him the question
[1:20:35] hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I
[1:20:37] commanded thee that thou shouldest not
[1:20:39] eat
[1:20:41] and the man said to woman whom thou gave
[1:20:42] us to be with me she gave me of the tree
[1:20:46] and I didn't eat
[1:20:48] all right I'm gonna pass it off right
[1:20:50] around and said Pius the book you know
[1:20:51] pass the book he said then she turns
[1:20:54] around and said the Beast is what caused
[1:20:55] the problem he said pass the buck
[1:20:58] anything we can do to try to get out
[1:21:00] from under the pressure
[1:21:04] right
[1:21:06] and Lord God said unto the woman what is
[1:21:09] this that thou has done and the woman
[1:21:11] said the serpent beguiled me and I did
[1:21:14] eat
[1:21:15] he defiled her
[1:21:17] we know what happened we know what took
[1:21:19] place the Lord God said unto the serpent
[1:21:23] now remember he made that serpent yet
[1:21:28] but it's interrelated because this
[1:21:30] serpent is the main serpent
[1:21:34] it doesn't talk about the seed of the
[1:21:36] Beast
[1:21:40] it's the seed of the serpent
[1:21:43] serpent is Satan
[1:21:46] Beast was an upright creature
[1:21:50] no problems
[1:21:54] that's why he'll call him serpent
[1:21:57] and then they'll call him Beast
[1:22:00] when you know it's not right in saying
[1:22:02] that he's a a serpenter and a beast
[1:22:06] but he's a beast and then made a serpent
[1:22:08] but it will go ahead and call him a
[1:22:10] serpent
[1:22:11] why because this is Satan God's dealing
[1:22:14] with
[1:22:15] this ain't that poor little beast he
[1:22:18] couldn't help it
[1:22:22] it's the main guy
[1:22:26] the one that had was having church with
[1:22:28] him while they were in the bushes
[1:22:36] the one that was telling him it was all
[1:22:38] right
[1:22:43] remember what we brought out
[1:22:47] the act that they physically done
[1:22:52] is a manifestation of an attribute
[1:22:56] the unbelief is the real wrong
[1:23:00] that serpent was there the whole time
[1:23:02] talking to Eve through the Beast
[1:23:06] right
[1:23:08] the beasts no problem
[1:23:11] with nothing and above every beast of
[1:23:13] the field
[1:23:14] upon thy belly shalt thou go
[1:23:17] now he's made a snark
[1:23:19] Serpent and thus shalt thou eat all the
[1:23:22] days of thy life
[1:23:24] but I love this one and I'll put enmity
[1:23:28] between
[1:23:29] thee and the woman
[1:23:32] not to be East in Eve
[1:23:37] there's no enmity between beast and Eve
[1:23:43] come on
[1:23:44] be sensible
[1:23:46] the Beast with nothing
[1:23:48] it was what he was just used
[1:23:51] I'll put enmity
[1:23:55] division
[1:23:57] separation
[1:23:59] between thee and the woman and between
[1:24:01] thy seed and her seed not the Beast
[1:24:09] sure we know the Beast seed was planted
[1:24:11] into Eve we know that
[1:24:14] but that's not what God is dealing with
[1:24:17] he's dealing with the serpent
[1:24:19] Satan because Satan's seed was what was
[1:24:22] planted there
[1:24:25] right
[1:24:27] but you know what I love about it
[1:24:30] I'll put enmity between thy seed now
[1:24:32] enmity according to Paul and the third
[1:24:36] is the carnal mind
[1:24:38] now we're right back where we've been
[1:24:40] for a while on the Eve in her memory
[1:24:44] reason conscious affection is where the
[1:24:47] problem took place
[1:24:49] right
[1:24:51] and that's where ours has taken place
[1:24:53] where Satan deals with but see that's
[1:24:55] the first promise of the coming Messiah
[1:24:58] that's the way rhodaram explained it
[1:25:02] I'll put in between I see now to
[1:25:05] actually Define this you've got to move
[1:25:07] this scripture way down to get it in the
[1:25:09] right order because he really said it
[1:25:11] this way brother random said it he said
[1:25:13] when they was going out of the garden
[1:25:15] foreign
[1:25:19] he said God looked down and couldn't let
[1:25:21] it happen he said he cried out I'll put
[1:25:23] enmity between thy seed and the seed of
[1:25:26] the woman
[1:25:28] as they were leaving the garden
[1:25:30] he gave them the promise
[1:25:32] all right
[1:25:34] look now watch let's get to this and
[1:25:36] we'll quit
[1:25:37] and of the woman he said I'll greatly
[1:25:40] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[1:25:42] sorrow shalt thou bring four children
[1:25:44] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[1:25:46] because she ate apples
[1:25:53] I hope we're not that carnal
[1:25:55] anymore
[1:25:57] because you ate apples
[1:25:59] well now when it was pomegranates well I
[1:26:01] don't care if it's peaches
[1:26:05] grapes
[1:26:11] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[1:26:14] and watch
[1:26:15] and he shall rule over thee
[1:26:17] because of what she done
[1:26:23] now
[1:26:24] if you want to get natural with it just
[1:26:26] for a second and thy desire shall be to
[1:26:29] thy husband there's what the difference
[1:26:31] between the man and the woman
[1:26:36] that's the part that was put there
[1:26:38] but the difference between Eve and the
[1:26:40] animals
[1:26:44] because her desire can be at any time
[1:26:46] okay
[1:26:47] but look and unto Adam he said because
[1:26:49] thou Hast hearkened unto the voice of
[1:26:51] thy wife
[1:26:52] and has eaten of the tree
[1:26:55] which I commanded cursed is the ground
[1:26:57] that I say my point ending it up on what
[1:27:01] brother Branham said God never cursed
[1:27:03] Adam
[1:27:05] God never cursed Eve he cursed the Beast
[1:27:08] made it a serpent he cursed the world
[1:27:13] but he never cursed Adam and Eve
[1:27:18] you need that quote I got it laying
[1:27:20] right over here
[1:27:21] he never cursed Adam and Eve
[1:27:25] just put it under a conditional
[1:27:27] situations and problems
[1:27:32] her desire is going to be to her husband
[1:27:33] and she'll have trouble with y'all
[1:27:35] bearing we'll let her let you know what
[1:27:36] the regional sin was
[1:27:39] all right
[1:27:40] but then his part was not cursed
[1:27:43] but it was put to the point that
[1:27:46] you'll have to make a living
[1:27:48] I had it all fixed where you didn't have
[1:27:50] to work
[1:27:51] I said now you're gonna have to work
[1:27:54] make a living
[1:27:56] not cursed
[1:27:58] as cursed
[1:27:59] all right we've got it as we're going
[1:28:01] through but we won't go through it I'll
[1:28:03] just say it for a little bit and state
[1:28:04] it see then when Cain he comes along he
[1:28:08] kills Abel
[1:28:16] and God puts a mark on Cain
[1:28:21] and people want to say that's blackness
[1:28:25] you know Darkness
[1:28:28] may I quote the prophet he said if that
[1:28:29] happened it would have ended it to flood
[1:28:31] because after the floods you had the
[1:28:33] sons of ham salmon
[1:28:35] you know the sons of Noah
[1:28:39] he said that would have ended the curse
[1:28:41] if you said it would be in black or a
[1:28:44] black person a negro as we would say
[1:28:46] African
[1:28:49] he said that won't work
[1:28:51] we were up at a meeting
[1:28:53] in the Carolinas and they were having
[1:28:55] questions and answers and these two
[1:28:57] really top-notch
[1:29:00] Elite guys was handling it and they
[1:29:03] asked the question
[1:29:04] said what was the mark put on somebody
[1:29:06] did what was Mark put on Cain
[1:29:08] and both of them stated they did not
[1:29:11] know
[1:29:12] well you know what I didn't either as
[1:29:15] smart as I am
[1:29:16] I didn't either
[1:29:18] nobody was coming back down the road
[1:29:21] and then a certain little brother
[1:29:23] sitting outside of me he used to be
[1:29:24] little he's a little bigger now
[1:29:27] and uh because he lost a little higher
[1:29:30] on top of the head too and a few things
[1:29:32] old brother Cauley was coming down
[1:29:34] through there and we're talking about
[1:29:35] that
[1:29:36] and I said well brother I really don't
[1:29:38] know the full answer I mean I could give
[1:29:39] my opinion he said I know what it is
[1:29:43] I said what is it he said I just
[1:29:46] listened to a tape the other day said
[1:29:48] brother Branham said to mark of the
[1:29:50] beast that was put on the mark of the
[1:29:52] beast was what was put on Cain
[1:29:54] I said well Glory Hallelujah
[1:29:59] because that's the truth
[1:30:02] it wasn't a Blackness mark it was the
[1:30:05] mark of the beast which was rejection
[1:30:06] and turning away because you keep on
[1:30:08] reading and it says Cain went out of the
[1:30:12] presence of the Lord it doesn't say God
[1:30:15] drove Cain out
[1:30:18] the only thing he'd done he put the
[1:30:20] swords are turning the way to guard the
[1:30:23] way of the Tree of Life
[1:30:25] that they couldn't get back to there and
[1:30:27] live forever
[1:30:30] but it wasn't no Mark of a Blackness or
[1:30:32] a certain way of doing this and the
[1:30:34] other it was the mark of the beast
[1:30:37] because he rejected God
[1:30:42] don't you remember
[1:30:43] God even said Cain if you'd done what
[1:30:46] was right
[1:30:47] and you want to approach from the
[1:30:49] prophet where he said
[1:30:51] Cain had an opportunity it was offered
[1:30:54] to him
[1:30:58] right
[1:31:00] but he wouldn't do it
[1:31:02] so it turned out to be the mark of the
[1:31:04] beast
[1:31:06] thank God for the truth
[1:31:09] right
[1:31:11] they don't always unto thee
[1:31:14] upper echelon elect
[1:31:17] and I say elect I'm not making no lie to
[1:31:19] nobody
[1:31:22] sometimes it comes to the little simple
[1:31:26] not saying brother Carly simple he just
[1:31:27] released in the tape he'd heard the
[1:31:29] prophet
[1:31:31] I told you about sister birds that time
[1:31:32] and I preached all night long on about
[1:31:35] that he said I come from God and went to
[1:31:37] God and I've done everything I could to
[1:31:40] get the people to see it and sister
[1:31:42] Birds going on home and and she she
[1:31:45] never would even have a vacuum cleaner
[1:31:48] she'd know how to turn the thing on we
[1:31:49] went and bought her a stove one day and
[1:31:51] she looked around all them things she
[1:31:52] said no it's got to be one to just a
[1:31:53] button she didn't want nothing else
[1:31:55] because she didn't handle nothing else
[1:31:57] and we were going down the road going
[1:31:59] home and she said brother Dale I see it
[1:32:01] I said okay well good
[1:32:03] she said he's come from God and he went
[1:32:05] to God said he's God the whole time
[1:32:10] I said sister ought to let you preach
[1:32:12] tonight
[1:32:14] I said I spent two hours trying to
[1:32:16] explain that you put it in simple words
[1:32:19] he was gone all the time
[1:32:22] because it's simple isn't it thank God
[1:32:25] for the truth come on brothers
[1:32:27] thank God for the truth that you you and
[1:32:30] I can just read the scriptures
[1:32:33] and understand
[1:32:35] things that we never was able to
[1:32:37] understand
[1:32:42] to see the truth unveiled before our
[1:32:45] eyes
[1:32:47] of God's word
[1:32:49] and then see why that you see if it
[1:32:52] wasn't a sex acts in the garden you know
[1:32:54] the thing that took place why did Jesus
[1:32:57] have to come by the wound of a woman
[1:33:00] why couldn't he been spoke out on a rock
[1:33:04] me
[1:33:06] you could just spend years of preaching
[1:33:08] on the things I was thinking about it
[1:33:10] today on what brought around was
[1:33:12] explaining the Apostle Paul and and
[1:33:14] talking about he went for three years
[1:33:16] and he said no way would he put his uh
[1:33:19] anything on his experience he said he
[1:33:22] had to have it on the word
[1:33:24] he said no Bible scholar would put it on
[1:33:27] experience
[1:33:28] he said he had to have it on the word
[1:33:32] you know what I got thinking about her I
[1:33:34] thought wouldn't that wasn't that
[1:33:35] wonderful
[1:33:39] you just think of three years
[1:33:44] now Paul knew
[1:33:47] because this is where I just thinking
[1:33:49] Paul knew certain scriptures about the
[1:33:51] Messiah
[1:33:52] they were looking for him he knew the
[1:33:55] the things that were said of that
[1:33:57] he could tell you about Isaiah and the
[1:33:59] promise and the things he might have
[1:34:01] been able to even told you of that in
[1:34:03] Genesis that I'll put enmity
[1:34:06] because I've always believed that those
[1:34:08] Pharisees and those people knew about
[1:34:10] the serpent seed
[1:34:13] I've always believed that ever since I
[1:34:14] heard brother Ryan tell what it was I've
[1:34:16] always believed that those Pharisees and
[1:34:18] time because why would they tell Jesus
[1:34:20] we weren't born a fornication like you
[1:34:26] you know what they were telling me you
[1:34:28] can't preach
[1:34:30] you can't be a preacher
[1:34:33] because we know who you know
[1:34:36] but think about it
[1:34:38] Paul out there for three years
[1:34:42] he'd say
[1:34:43] he's saying Lord
[1:34:45] I know about this and the promise and
[1:34:47] the things
[1:34:49] and then he'd drop back
[1:34:51] and he would read the scriptures
[1:34:54] and he'd read and I said just let my
[1:34:56] mind roll you know
[1:34:57] and he he'd read of
[1:34:59] of
[1:35:01] Joseph
[1:35:03] and he'd read about how that he was you
[1:35:05] know
[1:35:06] the coat of many colors and the many
[1:35:09] things and
[1:35:11] remember brother random didn't say you
[1:35:12] could see Jesus in every verse what did
[1:35:14] he say he said if you can't see Christ
[1:35:16] in every verse
[1:35:17] see brother Paul could pick that up and
[1:35:20] he'd say oh there it is there it is
[1:35:23] there's the Christ
[1:35:24] and just roll in my mind through a lot
[1:35:26] of the scriptures as brother Branham was
[1:35:28] talking
[1:35:29] of how that Paul began to see those
[1:35:32] things and he he let me write that down
[1:35:36] in for three years
[1:35:41] 24 hours a day seven days of the week
[1:35:46] I think Road around actually come on I
[1:35:47] think really is technically says three
[1:35:49] and a half years
[1:35:50] but
[1:35:51] what about all of that time in getting
[1:35:54] this Revelation from the scriptures that
[1:35:57] as he would read through the Bible
[1:35:59] he'd say well that's what that means
[1:36:03] that's why Moses was told to build a
[1:36:07] the Tabernacle
[1:36:09] exactly like this
[1:36:12] and how come
[1:36:13] Noah
[1:36:15] would build an ark
[1:36:18] for the saving of the household
[1:36:20] and he said I can see Christ
[1:36:23] you know
[1:36:25] I just thinking as he was saying those
[1:36:28] things about
[1:36:29] the great time Paul was having on the
[1:36:31] back side of the desert
[1:36:33] now nobody to argue with nobody fussed
[1:36:36] with
[1:36:37] all he had was the Scrolls
[1:36:39] need just sitting there reading them
[1:36:44] no wonder he could explain when he got
[1:36:46] over in what it is seven verse 7 of
[1:36:48] Hebrews about Melchizedek because see
[1:36:51] when he come across that in his mind he
[1:36:53] could see Abraham and the promises and
[1:36:56] the unconditional Covenant and then he
[1:36:58] would come down and see Abraham talking
[1:37:00] to Melchizedek
[1:37:01] and he'd look at that and he'd say
[1:37:04] there he is again
[1:37:07] revealing himself right through the word
[1:37:11] as it unfolded
[1:37:13] he didn't have no books to read other
[1:37:15] than the Scrolls
[1:37:18] right
[1:37:20] what do you think about it listen what
[1:37:22] do we got brother 96 in his final thank
[1:37:25] God for the truth
[1:37:28] that we can read the Bible for ourselves
[1:37:35] and I begin to arrive
[1:37:43] and it's my
[1:37:45] mind
[1:37:50] think about it
[1:37:55] the same Gods it was back there
[1:37:59] it's the same God that walks ashore to
[1:38:02] Galilee
[1:38:05] the same God
[1:38:07] they come down Through the Ages and
[1:38:10] we'll get into without worse the glory
[1:38:12] of its person
[1:38:14] we'll see the background from all the
[1:38:17] way coming down
[1:38:24] I hear the call
[1:38:28] do you
[1:38:30] he's Hebrews 13 8 the same yesterday a
[1:38:34] day and forever
[1:38:42] they were shut out in the woods
[1:38:46] foreign
[1:39:17] what about it he was wrong I don't ever
[1:39:21] spoke to your heart or revelation
[1:39:26] what's the difference in speaking to a
[1:39:29] prophet and speaking to you
[1:39:31] oh yeah
[1:39:36] with the same God lays
[1:39:39] the same one it spoken the prophet is
[1:39:42] the same one and speak to you
[1:39:52] I feel the poor
[1:39:58] I hear the calls
[1:40:04] I know his
[1:40:07] spirit's moving thank you for the word
[1:40:10] that you've given unto us the time that
[1:40:12] they've had together
[1:40:14] and I pray that you would just continue
[1:40:17] to open your word to reveal yourself
[1:40:21] for 15 years
[1:40:23] things has been unfolding
[1:40:26] and it'll never stop amen we love you
[1:40:29] father we thank you
[1:40:31] in Jesus name
[1:40:35] amen and amen amen
[1:40:46] think about him
[1:41:01] he speaks to me
[1:41:06] you've heard me tell about the time we
[1:41:09] were going to have to discuss marriage
[1:41:10] and divorce with a theologian
[1:41:13] in a ministered meeting
[1:41:16] and I'd always prayed about that
[1:41:18] scripture in Deuteronomy
[1:41:22] and where it says of you know a woman
[1:41:24] make Obi another man's wife you know and
[1:41:26] I'd always wondered well why does it say
[1:41:28] it like that
[1:41:30] I had no answer but I for some reason I
[1:41:33] had to burying the sitting in the corner
[1:41:36] right over there
[1:41:38] that's praying
[1:41:39] we come up on Friday night we were
[1:41:41] leaving Saturday to go to the meeting
[1:41:43] and uh
[1:41:45] I don't know you know I know the Lord
[1:41:47] was telling me that what is going to be
[1:41:49] brought up but and have no way of
[1:41:51] knowing
[1:41:53] and he dropped down and answered me that
[1:41:56] that night and he said
[1:41:57] that doesn't mean that I'm okay and for
[1:41:59] her to do it that just means she will go
[1:42:03] do it
[1:42:05] right so don't give her a ride don't
[1:42:06] don't do that I said because of the rest
[1:42:09] of the scripture where he can't take her
[1:42:10] back
[1:42:11] well then I had the scripture to answer
[1:42:14] my point you know because why couldn't
[1:42:16] he take her back if she's free
[1:42:19] and that when we got there that was the
[1:42:21] question
[1:42:22] well you know I felt pretty good
[1:42:25] oh brother said that night up there he
[1:42:27] said I hate for a man to ask the
[1:42:28] question when he's the only one in the
[1:42:30] building had the answer
[1:42:32] well I'm not bragging I just
[1:42:34] the answer was there
[1:42:37] and once the Theologian made his charges
[1:42:39] I just answered from the scriptures
[1:42:43] I said now let you Theologian verify
[1:42:45] whether
[1:42:46] it's okay for her to remarry or not
[1:42:52] he wouldn't do it I said he won't move
[1:42:54] but there's one thing about it this tape
[1:42:56] will verify it
[1:42:58] you get up and tell me I'm wrong come on
[1:43:02] I should eat of that
[1:43:03] or you shake your head he finally shook
[1:43:05] his head
[1:43:07] because see he knew he couldn't argue
[1:43:08] with that scripture
[1:43:10] because it did not say it was okay for
[1:43:12] her to do that
[1:43:13] that's what we read
[1:43:16] well see there you don't have no fear
[1:43:18] you understand
[1:43:20] when God reveals something to you I mean
[1:43:22] are you afraid of somebody coming along
[1:43:24] and convince you that water baptism in
[1:43:26] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:43:27] wrong
[1:43:29] well if you do you got a problem
[1:43:31] you know somebody come along and take
[1:43:33] the the Bible and prove there's three
[1:43:35] gods
[1:43:37] you got a problem if you don't have a
[1:43:40] revelation
[1:43:42] if you've got a revelation you don't
[1:43:43] worry do you
[1:43:45] because you'd already give you the
[1:43:47] answer
[1:43:48] I love it that way Lord Jesus we thank
[1:43:51] you for tonight we pray that what we've
[1:43:53] done has been what you wanted just kind
[1:43:55] of what we felt like doing Lord I pray
[1:43:57] that as we kind of move now out of the
[1:44:00] garden and get on into other things that
[1:44:02] Lord that you would come and speak to
[1:44:04] our hearts as we go along the way and
[1:44:07] guide each one of us be with everybody
[1:44:08] on the way home give a safe journey and
[1:44:11] let your loving grace be with each one
[1:44:13] of us we love you and we thank you in
[1:44:15] Jesus name
[1:44:26] Jesus the light of the world
[1:44:36] person
