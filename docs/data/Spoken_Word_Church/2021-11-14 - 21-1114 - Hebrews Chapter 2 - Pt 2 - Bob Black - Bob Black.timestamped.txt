[0:01] god bless you all it's good to be in the
[0:03] house of the lord
[0:07] let's turn over to hebrews chapter two
[0:09] where we've been going through and
[0:11] and just uh
[0:14] let's just get started by just reading
[0:15] through again
[0:19] i i think the bible was um it's almost
[0:21] meant to be read aloud
[0:23] and it's like to
[0:24] it's good to
[0:26] we used to get you know the kids
[0:27] together growing up and when they were
[0:29] growing up and and just just read
[0:30] through scriptures and it's just good to
[0:32] hear
[0:33] you kind of roll off a tongue
[0:36] hebrews chapter 2 says therefore we
[0:38] ought to give the more earnest to you to
[0:39] the things which we have heard lest at
[0:41] any time we should let them slip
[0:43] forth the word spoken by angels was
[0:45] steadfast and every transgression and
[0:46] disobedience received a just recompense
[0:48] of reward how shall we escape if we
[0:50] neglect so great salvation
[0:52] which at the first began to be spoken by
[0:55] the lord and was confirmed unto us by
[0:56] them that hurt him
[0:58] god also bearing them witness both with
[1:00] signs and wonders and with divers
[1:02] miracles and gifts of the holy ghost
[1:04] according to his own will
[1:06] for unto the angels hath he not put in
[1:08] subjection the world to come wherever we
[1:10] speak
[1:11] but one in a certain place testified
[1:13] saying what is man that thou art mindful
[1:15] of him or the son of man that thou
[1:16] visiteth him
[1:18] thou madest him a little lower than the
[1:19] angels thou crowns him with glory and
[1:21] honor and descent him over the works of
[1:23] thy hands
[1:24] thou has put all things in subjection
[1:26] under his feet
[1:27] friend that he put all in subjection
[1:29] under him he left nothing that is not
[1:31] put under him but now
[1:33] we see not yet all things put under him
[1:36] but we see jesus
[1:38] who was made a little lower than the
[1:39] angels for the suffering of death
[1:41] crowned with glory and honor that he by
[1:42] the grace of god should taste death for
[1:44] every man
[1:46] for it became him for whom are all
[1:48] things and by whom are all things
[1:50] and bringing many sons into glory to
[1:52] make the captains of their salvation
[1:55] perfect through sufferings
[1:59] for both he that sanctifieth and they
[2:01] who are sanctified are all of one for
[2:03] which because he is not ashamed to call
[2:05] them brethren
[2:06] saying i will declare thy name unto my
[2:08] brethren in the midst of the church will
[2:09] i sing praise unto thee and again i will
[2:12] put my trust in him and again behold i
[2:15] and the children which god hath given me
[2:17] for as much then as the children are
[2:19] partakers of flesh and blood he also
[2:21] himself likewise took part of the same
[2:22] that through death he might destroy him
[2:24] that had the power of death that is the
[2:26] devil
[2:28] and deliver them who through fear of
[2:29] death for all their lifetime subject to
[2:31] bondage
[2:32] for verily he took not on him the nature
[2:34] of angels but he took on him the seed of
[2:36] abraham
[2:37] wherefore in all things it behooved him
[2:39] to be made like unto his brethren that
[2:42] he might be a merciful and faithful high
[2:44] priest in things pertaining to god to
[2:45] make reconciliation for the sins of the
[2:48] people
[2:49] for in that he himself hath suffered
[2:51] being tempted he is able to sucker them
[2:54] that are tempted
[2:56] so let's start on verse 3 of that of
[2:58] that chapter
[3:00] there's so many so many good things
[3:02] packed in here
[3:03] and we would uh we stopped on verse
[3:05] three the last uh around around verse
[3:07] three so we'll just backtrack just a
[3:09] little bit um how shall we escape if we
[3:12] neglect we've got such a great salvation
[3:14] that's been given to us that christ came
[3:16] and died for us on the cross and all
[3:18] these things that we read about that
[3:20] paul is trying to express here how
[3:22] should we escape if we neglect this
[3:24] which at first began to be spoken by the
[3:26] lord and was confirmed unto us by them
[3:28] that hurt him in other words all those
[3:29] things jesus jesus preached for three
[3:31] and a half years and and preached a
[3:33] message
[3:34] sowed the seed
[3:35] and
[3:36] people heard him and then the things
[3:38] that they heard were later confirmed i
[3:40] was there when he walked on the water i
[3:42] was peter could say i was there when
[3:44] i saw him raise the dead i was there and
[3:47] you know we could say many of us sitting
[3:49] here today have that same testimony that
[3:51] we were there when we saw the life of
[3:53] christ made manifest and a little man a
[3:56] prophet that preached we were there when
[3:58] we were in meetings and saw people
[3:59] healed and
[4:00] and and things done and we were we were
[4:02] there when the life of christ actually
[4:05] changed our lives we were there we we're
[4:07] a witness
[4:08] how should we escape if we neglect this
[4:10] great salvation that so many even
[4:12] sitting here today are a witness of how
[4:14] should we escape and brother and god has
[4:17] provided a way he told us what the way
[4:18] of escape is
[4:20] then uh and we know that jesus said i am
[4:23] the way the truth and the life i am the
[4:25] way the if you if you abide in me if you
[4:28] can get in christ
[4:30] then you you have he is our way of
[4:32] escape and so he gave us the holy ghost
[4:35] to to change our lives to to change our
[4:38] thinking to to give us the ability to
[4:40] believe and so brother ramsay in and got
[4:43] us a provided way he said he sent back
[4:45] the holy ghost tonight
[4:47] which is god's provided way of your
[4:49] escape
[4:51] and so in the next verse
[4:53] verse 4 god also bearing them witness
[4:55] he's bearing bearing witness through the
[4:58] life of christ living out in the
[5:00] believers that is a witness that the
[5:03] life of christ is on display and as we
[5:06] keep reading it both with signs and
[5:07] wonders and with diverse miracles and
[5:09] gifts of the holy ghost according to his
[5:10] own will brother ram said god always
[5:13] bears witness
[5:14] and now what i'm what i'm doing
[5:15] basically is reading through hebrews
[5:17] chapter two the sermon brother brown
[5:19] preached so if you if you're interested
[5:20] you can go back and read a listen to
[5:22] that same sermon because brother brown
[5:24] says god always bears witness and how
[5:26] does he bear witness
[5:28] by that life the same life that was in
[5:30] christ living out in the believers
[5:33] living out in his church today he said
[5:34] your life will always will bear witness
[5:36] he said i don't care i don't know what
[5:38] your testimony is but your life speaks
[5:40] so loud
[5:42] your voice can't be heard
[5:44] but you're living your everyday life
[5:46] will testify what you are
[5:48] god bears witness yes the holy spirit is
[5:51] a seal
[5:53] and a seal takes both sides of the paper
[5:56] you're sealed on both sides inside and
[5:59] outside and so those those are the two
[6:02] how do i know that something's happening
[6:04] you know something's happened on the
[6:05] inside that nobody can see something's
[6:07] happening on the outside that everybody
[6:09] can see that's visibly displayed the
[6:11] life is displayed you know those those
[6:13] two things were they even carry on the
[6:16] revelation when john took the book and
[6:17] he ate it
[6:19] he began to he began to eat it and begin
[6:20] to understand the word but then it was
[6:24] bitter in his belly in other words it's
[6:25] got to be lived out you got to live it
[6:28] and and
[6:30] if you if you'll truly believe the word
[6:32] and the way that it was intended
[6:34] was brother ram expressed so many times
[6:36] and the greatest battle ever fought and
[6:38] so many messages if you believe it in
[6:39] the way that it was intended it was it
[6:41] will express itself on the outside
[6:46] the born again believer's life is just
[6:48] is it's the natural types of spiritual
[6:50] you can go out and look at an oak tree
[6:52] and you can tell it's an oak tree by the
[6:54] life that is expressed in that
[6:57] you can look at the bark and
[6:59] you know the bark like the doctrine you
[7:00] can look at the leaves the the
[7:01] fellowship you can look at all the
[7:03] things
[7:04] that is expressed in the life of an oak
[7:06] tree and you can say that's an oak tree
[7:07] you look at the life of a christian you
[7:09] can say that's a that's a real believer
[7:11] somebody that know that understands the
[7:13] word of god and that it's expressed on
[7:16] in their life
[7:18] because the life that the life of of
[7:21] christ is actually changing that person
[7:23] to make them stop cussing and stop stop
[7:26] all the things that they're that they
[7:27] used to do and changes you to a new
[7:29] creature
[7:32] so we're talking about the life paul is
[7:34] and so if you go to the next slide god
[7:36] also bearing them witness both with
[7:38] signs and wonders and with diverse
[7:40] miracles and gifts of the holy ghost
[7:42] according to his own
[7:44] will now now brother brown when he was
[7:46] explaining this in hebrews chapter 2
[7:48] when he preached that sermon he used the
[7:49] example of acts chapter 3 verse 4 when
[7:52] when peter and john were there at the
[7:54] gate beautiful and they came upon that
[7:56] man that was crippled and they said they
[7:58] fast he and peter fastening his eyes
[8:00] upon him with john said look on us why
[8:03] why would he say that
[8:05] now now they had just gone to pentecost
[8:08] and they had just been filled with the
[8:09] life of christ and now they've got that
[8:12] same life that was in jesus christ now
[8:15] god is bearing witness
[8:17] both with signs and wonders and with
[8:20] diverse miracles and gifts of the holy
[8:22] ghost in other words now that same life
[8:24] is living in them
[8:26] the same life is on them so peter
[8:29] peter's telling them not look on us
[8:31] because because we are witnesses that
[8:33] christ is alive look on us i got
[8:36] something to give to you what could they
[8:37] give they could give a word of
[8:39] encouragement they could give in part to
[8:41] them something that would spark that
[8:44] brother's faith so that he would know
[8:46] that christ was still alive
[8:49] that's why brother brown said he said
[8:50] brother when the world knows
[8:53] that you've been with jesus
[8:55] in other words the life is on display
[8:59] when you can live such an adulterated
[9:01] unadulterated life in this present world
[9:03] and in this darkness now he's
[9:05] elaborating on acts chapter 3 verse 4
[9:07] peter and john talking to this brother
[9:10] next to the gate beautiful
[9:11] look on us that brother all of a sudden
[9:14] standing there crippled in his condition
[9:15] at the gate beautiful
[9:17] knew that those two men had been with
[9:20] jesus
[9:21] they knew that he had been with that
[9:23] they had been with jesus he knew they
[9:24] had been with jesus when you can live
[9:26] such an unadulterated life in this
[9:28] present world in this darkness that the
[9:30] world knows
[9:32] and can see that you've been with jesus
[9:34] when a rugged old vulgar prostitute of
[9:36] the street can become a lady washed in
[9:38] the blood of the lamb
[9:40] god is bearing witness that he's lit
[9:42] that he lives
[9:44] that's what paul's talking about in
[9:45] hebrews chapter 2 verse 4 god also
[9:48] bearing them witness
[9:49] he said take a drunkard who was so low
[9:51] down that he would run around on his
[9:53] wife that he would mistreat his children
[9:55] and take the food from the table
[9:58] to spend on a prostitute let him get
[10:00] with jesus once you'll see him returning
[10:02] like legion who was in his right mind
[10:04] and clothed to his babies and to his
[10:06] wife and to his loved ones if we go to
[10:09] the next slide why because it is a new
[10:11] birth and a change of heart that changes
[10:13] a man brother brown said in the lamb and
[10:15] the dove in 1957
[10:17] from a dying being to a resurrected
[10:20] immortal son of god taking his plate on
[10:23] place on the seat of the believer's
[10:24] heart it's a nature change
[10:28] a nature change
[10:30] the life of christ that's why jesus said
[10:32] i am the vine year the branches because
[10:34] when you get tapped into the
[10:36] the the the source of the life that same
[10:39] life
[10:40] is flowing through the life of the
[10:42] believer
[10:44] now if we go to the next slide
[10:46] let's see see where paul's line of
[10:48] thought is going he's talking about that
[10:51] that that life is living in you and so
[10:53] he continues that in hebrews chapter 2
[10:55] verse 5
[10:56] for unto the angels hath he not put in
[10:58] subjection the world to come wherever we
[10:59] speak what's he talking about he's he's
[11:02] he's planning god's purpose is to put
[11:05] the world into your subjection
[11:08] the great angels that ministers in the
[11:10] heavens gabriel michael woodworm and the
[11:12] tens of thousands times tens of
[11:14] thousands of angels of heaven or the
[11:16] tens of hundreds of prophets that's been
[11:18] on the earth every one of them he's
[11:20] never put any of them to have control
[11:21] over the world to come that we speak of
[11:23] not a one he never said isaiah you'll
[11:25] control the world
[11:27] he never put the world in subjection to
[11:29] elijah
[11:30] neither did he put it to gabriel or any
[11:32] angel or any ministering spirit
[11:34] but one in a certain place david and on
[11:36] the next slide he said
[11:38] saying what is man
[11:40] that thou art mindful of him are the son
[11:42] of man
[11:43] that thou visites him
[11:45] now look how brother random expresses
[11:46] this who who are you anyhow we think
[11:48] that we're so great there's no
[11:52] keep keep the thought in your mind
[11:53] there's no value in your life there's so
[11:56] many i was reading the other night and a
[11:58] sermon brother brown priest she said
[11:59] look around on the world and there's so
[12:01] many people walking by getting on the
[12:03] subway getting in their cars doing
[12:04] things that are not going to be anything
[12:07] there's not going to be any value in
[12:09] their life they're just going to be
[12:10] cannon fodder and one day that life will
[12:12] come to an end but you
[12:15] that have been redeemed by the blood of
[12:17] the lamb that's been filled with the
[12:18] holy ghost that you've been you've
[12:19] become part of christ
[12:21] he said who are you anyhow we think
[12:23] we're so great in our seal but without
[12:25] the holy ghost we're nothing
[12:27] but he said blessed be the lord you've
[12:30] got a soul that's born again
[12:32] what is man that thou art mindful of him
[12:35] or the son of man that thou visites him
[12:37] you're nothing without christ but if
[12:39] you've got christ that changes
[12:41] everything you've got christ in your
[12:43] life he said you'll live forever and
[12:45] ever because he become you that you
[12:47] through his grace might become him and
[12:50] make a place for you
[12:51] oh we who think that we got a change of
[12:53] clothes and a few groceries in the house
[12:55] what are we god can take it in a second
[12:58] your very breath holds it in his hand
[13:01] and here it is
[13:02] it's christ that makes everything christ
[13:05] is the thing without christ none of us
[13:07] are nothing we wouldn't have nothing to
[13:09] preach we wouldn't have nothing to say
[13:11] what would we be doing here at church if
[13:12] it wasn't for christ christ is the thing
[13:15] so if you're not born again this this
[13:16] morning today that that is the thing
[13:19] that you should be seeking with all of
[13:20] your heart because christ is what gives
[13:22] you purpose jesus christ is what gives
[13:25] your life meaning without christ you're
[13:27] just going to work and going to school
[13:29] or whatever and going through it getting
[13:30] up and going going to sleep when you get
[13:32] home and getting up and do it all over
[13:33] again the next morning and
[13:35] playing video games and going to see
[13:37] hollywood movies and and what purpose
[13:40] does life have without christ christ is
[13:42] the thing that gives
[13:44] life meaning and purpose
[13:46] and he said here in our midst
[13:49] to heal the sick
[13:51] to proclaim and profess and to foretell
[13:53] and every time perfect
[13:55] and even concerned enough to bring a
[13:57] little dead fish back to his life again
[13:59] in the midst of us
[14:00] jehovah around us jehovah in us the
[14:03] great and mighty i am you think about a
[14:05] christ that cares so much for us that he
[14:08] he proved it by coming down and raising
[14:09] a little fish from the dead to prove
[14:11] that if he cares enough for a little
[14:12] fish to raise it from the dead he cares
[14:14] enough for you to heal you in your
[14:16] broken condition your broken mind your
[14:18] broken body he cares enough for you this
[14:21] morning
[14:23] and in hebrews chapter 2 verse 7 says
[14:25] thou madest him a little lower than the
[14:27] angels thou crownest him with glory and
[14:29] honor and just set him over the works of
[14:31] thy hands
[14:32] and brother ram said an angel said that
[14:34] god made him an angel paul
[14:37] an angel said that god made him lower
[14:40] than an angel
[14:41] that he might crown him and he might
[14:44] suffer
[14:45] and taste death
[14:47] to be exalted up again
[14:49] you think you think about that pattern
[14:51] of the scripture that christ showed us
[14:53] how a christian is going to live by
[14:55] getting as low as he could so that he
[14:57] could be exalted now we think we're
[14:59] going to live any different we've got to
[15:01] live we've got to get so low that we're
[15:02] not higher than the dust because brother
[15:04] adam said when you when you
[15:06] get higher than the dust
[15:08] you're you raise yourself higher than
[15:10] god
[15:10] don't ever get higher
[15:12] don't ever try to exalt yourself do you
[15:15] think about how low jesus jesus came
[15:18] he came
[15:20] you know when we were born we we were
[15:22] many of us here we were born in a nice
[15:23] hospital or or even in a in a in a home
[15:26] that had you know nice pillows and
[15:28] things but jesus came down and was born
[15:31] in a little manger next to next to cows
[15:33] and goats over in the corner making
[15:35] fertilizer and just he he was born in
[15:37] such a such an humble way
[15:41] he came down so low lower than than even
[15:44] if we wanted to get down that low he
[15:46] came lower than we could even fathom it
[15:48] seems like
[15:50] in matthew matthew chapter 23 it says
[15:52] neither be called but jesus said give
[15:55] trying to try and exhort and tell us the
[15:56] pattern get get as low as you can
[15:59] neither be called masters for one is
[16:01] your master even christ
[16:03] but he that is greatest among you shall
[16:05] be your servant so if you want to be
[16:07] great be the servant of your brothers
[16:09] and sisters
[16:11] if you want to be great then humble
[16:13] yourself down where you can go visit the
[16:15] poor and visit the week and help
[16:17] somebody else
[16:18] if you want if you want to because
[16:21] a big shot then some something's off in
[16:24] your understanding of christianity
[16:26] because he said whosoever shall exalt
[16:28] himself
[16:29] shall be abased and he that shall humble
[16:32] himself shall be exalted what are we
[16:34] humbling ourselves to we're humbling
[16:36] ourselves to the word we're getting
[16:38] ourselves out of the way so that his
[16:39] word can be expressed
[16:42] that's why if we go to the next slide
[16:45] brother i'm getting went on to talk
[16:46] about how a body has to thou made me the
[16:49] body of the lord jesus christ
[16:51] made lower than the angels to take death
[16:54] and none with the very highest of high
[16:56] christ the prince of peace the king of
[16:58] kings the lord of lord the creator every
[17:01] star in the universe he became lower
[17:03] than his creation that he might redeem
[17:06] man and give them a home in heaven
[17:09] he left the glories of heaven he left
[17:11] the highest name that could be called
[17:13] and when he was on earth man give him
[17:15] the lowest name that they could give him
[17:17] said he was an illegitimate baby to
[17:19] start with
[17:20] born in a manger wrapped in rags off the
[17:22] back of a back of a yoke of an ox no
[17:26] place to go had no home to go
[17:28] to and was called beelzebub the chief of
[17:30] the devils he was mistreated he was spit
[17:33] on he was made fun of he was rejected
[17:35] and went to the lowest pits and stooped
[17:38] to the vilest of prostitutes
[17:40] that's what man done to him
[17:44] we'll go to the next slide
[17:46] thou crownest him with glory and honor
[17:49] and did set did set him over the works
[17:52] of thy hands but god brother ram said
[17:54] god raised him up so high
[17:56] that he'd have to look down to see
[17:58] heaven man given the lowest seat given
[18:02] the worst place the lowest name god
[18:04] raised him up and give him the highest
[18:06] seat and the highest name
[18:08] that's the difference what man done with
[18:10] the son of god and what god done with
[18:12] the son of god
[18:14] he stooped that we might be lifted he
[18:16] said no wonder he was exhausted
[18:18] no wonder he is who he is tonight
[18:22] god has exalted him and all the powers
[18:24] and heavens and earth
[18:26] is him
[18:29] because he stooped so low
[18:33] now if we go to the next verse in
[18:34] hebrews chapter 2 verse 8
[18:37] it says thou has put all things in
[18:40] subjection under his feet i see paul you
[18:42] know he's echoing what we read in the
[18:44] first chapter that everything is under
[18:46] his feet for in that he put all in
[18:48] subjection under him he left nothing
[18:50] that is not put under him
[18:52] but now we see not yet all things put
[18:54] under him that's a seems like a very
[18:56] confusing scripture
[18:58] that everything's put under him but but
[19:00] not we don't quite yet see everything we
[19:03] don't see yet
[19:05] death and you know if if you're just a a
[19:08] a a newborn christian there's think god
[19:11] is actually working
[19:13] working out
[19:14] things in your life that you will see it
[19:16] through your christian journey things
[19:18] begin to leave you you don't see
[19:20] everything at once just like there at
[19:21] the beginning of the the ephesus church
[19:24] agent that it took a while for things to
[19:26] unfold
[19:27] uh irenaeus martin columba luther wesley
[19:30] as they began to preach things began to
[19:32] unfold until finally you get to the last
[19:33] church age and and god is actually
[19:36] building he's building something up by
[19:38] the by that life that he died so that he
[19:40] could put back in his church he's he's
[19:43] doing something so that finally at the
[19:45] very last death the last enemy will be
[19:48] destroyed
[19:49] that's why brother brown said but now we
[19:51] see not yet all things put under him
[19:52] that's death we don't see death yet
[19:54] because we're still dying
[19:56] we see death
[19:58] but here's i love this scripture and the
[20:00] next the next scripture but we see jesus
[20:04] we see jesus who was made a little lower
[20:06] than the angels for the suffering of
[20:07] death crown with glory and honor that he
[20:09] by the grace of god should take death
[20:11] taste death for every man
[20:14] we see jesus
[20:17] now
[20:18] that's
[20:19] when we come to church that's what we're
[20:21] coming to church for us to see jesus
[20:23] to actually see and and how do you how
[20:25] do you well we'll we'll get into this
[20:27] through some quotes that we'll read in a
[20:29] second but how how how do you see jesus
[20:32] you can't see him with your physical eye
[20:35] he's not going to come walking through
[20:36] the aisles of this church within a
[20:38] physical body but we see him by the our
[20:40] spiritual eyesight becoming open to see
[20:43] the revelation of who he is now jesus is
[20:46] the word he's the actual the expression
[20:49] of god and so we've got we got on the
[20:52] pages of this bible the the written the
[20:54] written words of god and so if we see to
[20:58] see jesus you open up the word and you
[21:00] begin to look and it begins to paint a
[21:02] picture so that you can see
[21:05] jesus by looking at the word if you want
[21:07] to see the word then you go to the word
[21:09] and that's how you see jesus
[21:12] so
[21:13] brother brown said the people when they
[21:15] when he when he was coming down the the
[21:16] street there to die on the cross and
[21:19] going through all the the the motions of
[21:21] that day he said he said let's take our
[21:23] picture to jerusalem 2000 years ago how
[21:25] could you reject it i hear a sound
[21:27] coming through the street a bumping of
[21:29] something an old rugged cross coming
[21:30] down going out the gates of damascus
[21:33] there was actually the word made flesh
[21:35] coming down the street and nobody
[21:37] recognized it because they couldn't see
[21:40] that that was jesus
[21:41] you know compare that to today the word
[21:43] is being preached the bible is being
[21:46] lived out but so many people out out in
[21:48] the in in the world cannot see jesus
[21:52] just like in that day he said the people
[21:53] were blind they didn't know him
[21:55] they didn't recognize him you say blind
[21:58] could they have their sight you could
[22:00] still have your sight and be blind
[22:03] you can have your physical eyesight and
[22:06] be blind spiritually to not be able to
[22:08] see the word of god to not be able to
[22:10] see what's in these pages
[22:12] so we see jesus now we're not we might
[22:15] not yet see death destroyed where people
[22:17] are still dying people are still getting
[22:19] sick but we see jesus
[22:21] we know we know the the revelation of
[22:23] the word he said now if we go to the
[22:25] next slide he said people are blind
[22:27] tonight a certain church that don't
[22:29] believe in divine healing walked up to
[22:31] me one time and said smite me blind this
[22:33] might be blind
[22:35] is the point he's trying to make is
[22:36] you're already blind
[22:38] he said i said friend the devil has
[22:40] already done it you're already blind
[22:41] sure you are he said heal this little
[22:44] girl and i believe you could you imagine
[22:45] somebody saying that i said save that
[22:48] sinner and i believe you certainly oh he
[22:50] said he has to believe i said same thing
[22:52] here it has to come through the
[22:53] sovereign grace of god
[22:55] the devil the god of this world has
[22:57] blinded the eyes of the people they've
[22:59] got eyes but they can't see
[23:02] you do you see what a grace it is if
[23:04] your eyes have been opened to the word
[23:06] of god if you can look into the word and
[23:09] see the blueprint becoming open to know
[23:12] what your purpose is and what god wants
[23:14] you to do and maybe you know at the
[23:16] beginning of your journey you don't
[23:17] really understand how we're going to
[23:19] take a body change but the word begins
[23:21] to open up and you begin to see
[23:24] or understand what we're doing here and
[23:27] what the purpose of the message is and
[23:29] the purpose of the gospel that we're
[23:31] hearing and you see what it is you
[23:34] understand he said the devil the god of
[23:36] this world is blinded the eyes of the
[23:38] people they've got eyes but they can't
[23:41] see
[23:44] so we see jesus if we go to the next
[23:46] slide
[23:47] we see jesus we don't see all things but
[23:49] we do see jesus who was made a little
[23:52] lower than the angels for the suffering
[23:54] of death
[23:55] let's go to the next slide he said
[23:58] and then jesus came and called and the
[24:00] musicians can go ahead and come forward
[24:02] we're gonna we're gonna end on this he
[24:03] said he was that truly he was that plus
[24:05] god he was the manifestation
[24:08] jesus is the body the boy the man god
[24:11] was what dwelt in him god was in him he
[24:14] was a god man he was a man yet he was
[24:17] god manifested in flesh
[24:19] when we see jesus
[24:22] we see god
[24:24] that's what he said when you see the
[24:25] father see me you see the father because
[24:28] he was the reflection
[24:30] he was the word that was in the
[24:32] beginning so when you see the word
[24:35] you're seeing god
[24:37] when you see this word when it begins to
[24:40] be opened up to you you are seeing jesus
[24:43] we might not see everything but we see
[24:46] jesus and we'll just end on that lord
[24:48] that is blessing
