care of everything just keep praying for her God to give her strength remember the brother Tom and Brother Dean and just remember all these that are sick among us and brother Al's uncle passed away so keep all these in mind that the the Lord would be with each one that's right you know the sicknesses and all because we believe he's a Healer and we thank God for it if you like turning your scriptures turn to Ephesians one where we've been reading now we're going to try to have just kind of like of a a little review and then we'll have some questions and I have just a few written out so if you have any then you know get ready and we'll cover them if we take it we'll do this afternoon also because we'll we'll try to cover it not that we can answer the questions but we will try our best to and we know who who has the answer to everything correct all right remember also now the Bible study that's coming Saturday 6:00 and remember brother Claude wi singer will be be with us here on the 10th of April so we'll keep all of these announcements in mind as we're going along and then remember the Easter weekend and uh brother Pinkston being with us so remember all of the the announcements amen Ephesians 1 father we thank you we love you we ask you that you would just come Among Us Lord today to not to just to be here to record our actions and deeds but to be here as the great preeminent one in each one of our hearts and lives we love you father and we thank you we know that there's many many sicknesses Among Us many things father we ask you to just reach down your atonement and the prophet said you'd rather that we be healed and we are are to get healed so then Lord we thank you for what you're given us because we believe you now just make yourself manifest and Lord if there's anything that we could do we would try our best to help anyone but we know it's not possible for us but we know that with you all things are possible guide us now forgive our sins and just lead us in thine understanding and keep us as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen that's right Ephesians 1 verse3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings we're at now in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the blood in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he ha abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've tried to cover on this series of predestination and we preached about 15 messages on it to try to get you to do and we'll see this afternoon that we will be leaving uh the more or less the the beginnings and and the start and the things like that of of predestination and coming down to life amen to where we live you say well we've been doing that it's true but our mind our main thought in our mind has been to try to to uh look backward because remember what we were talking about in predestination if you can't look as far backward as you can forward that's right or forward as you can backward then you don't really see the Eternal God so then that way you know we need to uh to uh get down now to where the earth a part of us living and then we'll we'll continue on with that but now remember the one thing that I told you all the way through this part of one point now if God doesn't know the beginning from the ending then what kind of a god do you serve that's right you know if he doesn't know all things then there's really no need of serving him he's just some kind of a god you con it up down through time and and it wouldn't do us any good whatsoever but I believe in in eternal etal God that you know his thoughts is always Eternal that's right now what he thought of is not always Eternal because you know anything has a beginning is not Eternal so a lot that he thought of is not Eternal and a lot he thought of one day will become Eternal that's right you know but still at the present stage of time there's a lot of things that are not into that Eternal State all right now so let's just run through just a little bit of a thought and then you know turn it over to you for the we'll take the questions and answers and things and and uh you know see what's on your mind about it but now remember never forget the point that when you're dealing with what is upon Earth all right everybody understand that point right see when you're dealing with what happens in time the existence upon Earth my whole point was to try to drive this down in that God's for knowledge he wouldn't predestinate remember according to his own desires that's right cuz he desired that everybody be saved right but he would predestinate according to his for knowledge all right and we seen that brother brand said now that predes that you know predestin what election even in the Ephesians parallels Joshua election looks back to forn knowledge and predestination looks to Destiny well all right then we looked and seen that that everything is predestination looks back right everything is looking back to for knowledge so never forget that amen every what you think about how great your Revelation is of predestination and we're this seed and we're this this and we're that and all of the other that's that's well and good but just remember mhm it all goes back to for knowledge and if you leave for knowledge you come out into predetermining and then by be predetermining then you're making it to the point that God did make something happen to one person or not to the other Etc but remember it's all for knowledge it doesn't matter what you think about this great seeds and things that everybody wants to talk about just remember there was a time that you and I I believe did not have eternal life amen all the quotes the prophet would give we put used them and brought them together to show you if you have eternal life eternal life always was eternal right and his seed remaineth in us and we cannot sin but yet we are sinners that's right amen right right cuz only Christians have sins the devil and his children are condemned already right all right but the seed is what remaineth in US that can't sin that's right all see now then that way then looking at it in a simple point then that God could look down through time before he created anything and he could see whatever person in the world would be their desires right and I'm glad that the prophet explained it to us that that even the people who do not hear of Jesus Christ Christ right in Heathen lands Etc that you know that it's never spoke of of Jesus Christ that those people are not judged according everybody's not judged on the same scale that's right thank you Lord but they'll be judged according to the way they lived according to their own laws and and doings now that's a gracious God I love that now see because that way it doesn't put that well you know all them people out there is going to die and go to hell because they didn't hear about Jesus well that's you know a lot of people will die and go to hell but it's going to be a lot of more of religious people that die and go to hell that did hear about Jesus then they will about those that didn't hear about him because God Is Not An unjust God right so then then that way we can look at predestination and see that God as we got into Romans work talking about how can the thing formed right right you know make me thus you know well God didn't make us wrong amen he gave us a choice he knew the choice we'd receive if he didn't he's not God right forget it let's go home have a good time you know and just live it on out you know but if we're going to believe in a God then let's believe that God knows all things and he knew our choices we'd make he knew what we would do in life you know and in doing all of that then he could predestinate it to be that way not make it be that that way that's our point of predestination we think God made it that way no he knew what it would be that's my whole driving point of what we've been talking about he knew what it would be and thereby he could predestinate amen amen and it would be to that point see it would be then by his for knowledge because that's the only way the prophet said God does is predestinate by his for knowledge all right then that way as I said you don't have to worry about it see then you can go back and you can read what scriptures we read and you can understand that you know we were predestinated in him all right now then that a way we can bring it down to the point that those who he fornew right amen he did predestinate amen amen see then that way everything as I said everything that happens in this life is predestinated by for knowledge it doesn't matter who it is right amen or else what kind of a god do you have predestinated because his four knowledge knew what we' do he knew every that that would ever be in the world and every time it would B it out how much Tyler the prophet said it would make well if he knows all of that then we don't have to worry about it he he knows all things well then that just don't give me a choice because if he know I was going to miss it I'm going to miss it well then that you made the choice right you done it that's right he didn't say that right you made the choice see so then we can't blame God for the choice we made that's right but we believe that he will guide us in our choice yeah right right amen I believe in that you know because he he knew see that people would be saved so then he could predestinate it all right now we got that part out of the way to where we can understand you know and really get down to just saying a few words now get to point now all that happens in an Earthly Journey it doesn't matter where it would be Russia raising up China raising up this country raising up that people raising up this happening that happening right God forew all things and that way he could write it down okay so we knew how many people people would want to be saved and who wouldn't want to be saved so we could write as the scripture says in Revelation 13:8 he could write our names down in the book or leave them out and it not be a respector of persons but would be giving everybody a change as I said if he will if he judges the people who hasn't heard the gospel by the way they lived according to their laws and their rituals and ways and things if if he judges them according to that then he does give everybody a change right amen that's right you said well I've never heard but one sermon well that was enough right right you had to change you had a choice all right see then we know for certainty that he didn't make anything happen right but he knew what would happen happen that's right and he could go ahead and write everything down and settle that at score now that should be enough to follow for knowledge and predestination about what I've tried to say because then we look at it and we say but now that that's fine but that's for everybody that's all right but we got to keep it for everybody right you know Salvation is not for everybody right but we got to preach it for everybody right God still no matter what he still came down and offered salvation to people right that he knew they were not going to receive it that's right now as you get that point going through that he he would actually come down right there with Judas isar for three and 1/2 years that's right yep talking with him fellowshipping with him every day m H and every day he gave him a change right but he made his own choice so don't blame God now right and say when now Lord you didn't give me a chance he give us a chance right amen that's right and you and I certainly can't say it because he's really given us a chance right see now so it's according to our own choosing yes but brother that's not that great predestination that that this just makes me that don't make me excited that's what I said I kept emphasizing one thing I said why are we afraid of forn knowledge you remember that why are we afraid of forn knowledge see we're afraid of the fact that we have something to do with it that's right and we can't blame somebody else right that's easy to do isn't it yes you know how we like to pie the buck you know iing on somebody else well it's their fault it's their fault do that makes us feel so good we went out and done it but it's their fault go out and kill somebody and say well it was their fault cuz they not have been there that day you know we've got all kind of excuses and ideas but it doesn't work does it all right but we did see there's one thing that we picked up in there that that I hope you followed the line of it and I'll try to say a few words about it we know that God before the world he had attributes he never gained any attributes coming down he only displayed them coming down he had always had those attributes he always was a savior you said well well they wasn't anything you know lost that doesn't that doesn't change that he was a Healer well it was nothing you know but see you're not looking at it right he he had those attributes within him right amen see and we say well it's just his thoughts well that's all right but there's deeper things to it to me than to just say it's just his thoughts right see an attribute is a part of you that's right right and you're you're an offspring of somebody so that means you're the attribute of somebody it's more than just somebody thought of you right but see having those attributes then we saw that he had an attribute in him was to be a father that's that's right amen all right so we easily accept the fact that he had an attribute to be a Healer so we easily want to express that it would mean that somewh something would have to come into being that would be sick where he could display his attribute right but what about him being a father you know that would mean he had children right there was a time I couldn't be called a father why because I didn't have any children you say well they was in right but they wouldn't out of me either and by myself I couldn't get them out of me to do any good that's right right but see he was a father so that meant what not that he wanted children right are you listening this was my point now it was not that he wanted children right cuz that could be me standing here and say I want children I want children well go get married no I'm not going to go get married yeah I want my children well you're not going to get any of that away right but it was not just that he wanted children he had his children right his children was a part of him right that's why we're The Offspring of God that's why we're not just sons of Jesus that was the son of God Amen and he wasn't a second person amen and neither are we a second person that's right we're either God made manifest in human flesh called a son or we've missed the whole story all right we are the children of God Amen which is God made manifest yeah all right see then doing that then we come over to the point of seeing that we talk about him being a father then surely we can see that it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally right that's for for knowledge amen that's right all but it's to seed our word amen amen all right I believe the children of God were predestinated eternally amen because they're part of God right amen we didn't come to earth now listen we come to Earth lost come on that's right all but we didn't come to Earth and in some roundabout way be able to uh make God make us his children right that's right no he knew what we'd want y That's right so he had it ready for us now but in accepting that it brought that eternal life amen that was there that we didn't get to come that way but we were part of him right remember how we brought it out that when he was standing there to create the world we had to be in him that's right if we wasn't in him then we never will be in him that's right so there he stood with all of us in him it wasn't Eve coming with Adam in her with Adam come and Eve in him see we get the story messed up right see Jesus Christ came here with us in him what how people were we people no no no what were we right the part of God that he was the eternal life amen that's right see then that way the the seed could come down through time and each age would manifest that seed or people right and as that people would receive the eternal life that would be that a live word for each age that's right see then being the live word you would see that that seed come predestinated eternally that's right that's right cuz anything Eternal have no beginning no ending that's right the eternal life you have today is a part of God or else it's not eternal life right see then once doing that that's word you know you think I'm long about doing it but see there's some things in there I wanted to preach on and I've kind of bypassed them because you know you can impart eternal life sure amen absolutely I believe in that am amen if you have it that's right yep that's the only thing I've ever tried to give away was the eternal life that God gave me amen you say well that's dumb I agree with you but you're not getting the point I'd love for you to have what I have am that's the point I'm trying to get and that way you can impart eternal life not because I go out and do it no because I preach the gospel that's right because you preach the gospel because you live the gospel that's right and you offer people around you eternal life amen that's right all they got to do is want what you got right then when they get what you got you just imparted eternal life well because that's true the gospel right see I want to preach on some of those things but that's all right we get back to them but we know that he chose us in him before the foundation of the world now you remember that so that if he chose us in him it meant we had to be in him right he didn't choose us to be later or something that's right the eternal life that he had we have to be a part of that eternal life right so he chose us the scripture said in him so that mean we were right there the prophet said that gives Eternal quality to the elect that's right why because we're of the same Source you remember that quote we're of the same source that's right see that's where they messed it up at NAA cuz at NAA they were trying to figure out if Jesus you know and God was the same substance or Source right and they come up with the idea now that he was the second person he wasn't the same you know Source he wasn't the same elements or say that's where they messed it right they messed it up see amen missed it there all but you see then if he's in you the eternal life that's in you you that's eternal life that's God's own life amen that's right making you and I God made manifest in human flesh right amen all right now I'm trying to get some things through and then I I'll get back to your questions and answers then we begin to talk about where the scripture says Ezekiel 18:4 that All Souls are mine see Satan cannot create that's right that's right amen he can't give you a soul right he can only pervert you he can't give you a soul see well see people will say well the soul is just the nature of the spirit all right that's not a direct quote there because when you say just that messes it up the quote is the soul is the nature of the spirit but you better remember one thing that brother Rand says like souls in prison he said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again he said if not it's of the world Amen so then Satan cannot give you a soul right so then you two Soul people and all that would have been wrong see that's but he can pervert the nature of your soul that's right see pervert us to make us go wrong all right because All Souls it doesn't matter Adolf Hitler Soul came from God right cuz Satan cannot create that's what we're going to get to this evening see is what is man right we're going to get down Dro down to earth now this evening but we trying to stay you know in up into the heavenlies and back into the eternities then we got to come down to where we're at now and start a journey through life all right but you see I believe that God created ever so amen amen but did he create them before the world and set them in little cubicle holes and then when you was needed it come out went down come out went down come out went down that's the same old thing of the two Souls the two Soul people said that God created your soul and Satan created the soul and that's why you had two souls and they was both in the same place I told him I said well if that be so then all we need to do is kill the people yeah that automatically sends you to heaven because it kill the old soul but you see people think a soul is just some nature some something but we'll get to it more this evening your soul is the real you that's right it's a whole lot more real than your body and spirit is that's right but yet we can look at it and see it but we we just can't find that Soul right we just find it as some kind of a nature of a form no it's not that it's got to be you amen but see then getting it down to it now in a hurry I believe there's only one Soul right that ever come Eternal right right I believe every individual person you know comes into the world that God breathes into our nostrils and we become a living Soul that's when he gives you that Soul he he permits it the prophet said that's right right Mom and Daddy brought your body God gave you a spirit and a soul he gave it to you perfect he didn't give it to you Eternal he gave it to you perfect right cuz God cannot create something imperfect that's right amen there's no way right where would he create it from right so that's why a baby's perfect when it comes into the world it's perfect as you look this sure but even as I told you that the way used to be and I know the world's getting so perverted now it's not right but in my day back when we was kids and all a baby born was almost immune to sicknesses for about 6 months if it was breastfed baby from his mother right cuz that was how pure the lines at least was running right but God cannot create something imperfect you said when I come a baby with one arm missing now God didn't create that right that was brought by Mom and Daddy to the process that God permitted but he didn't make it see you can't make him the author of wrong amen that's right but see then every soul that come in the world God had to God had to create that Soul amen yep and then when you're born he gives it to you oh Lord right and then you're judged according to that right all right but there's one soul that came from God Eternal amen that's right and if we Wen in Jesus Christ when he was here we never will be that's right that's right amen now I'm not talking about any his body now I'm not talking about a spirit part of us I'm talking about eternal life that's right amen cuz there's only one form of eternal life so if you have eternal life today it has to be that God gave you his own life right and his life is his being and what he is yeah I know I tried to preach that many years ago been 30 years or so ago and I'm talking about God and a soul and people said well brother Dale is saying God's got a soul I really didn't say God's got a soul I said God was a soul cuz he's a being he's a person that's right it's real to me amen and that Soul as we'll get to it later brother R said that soul went to hell y Amen to preach to those Spirits in prison right he said you and I went with him y That's right I've done been to Hell and back I don't have to worry about it right why because the one that I was in went to hell and back I don't have to go that's right he paid my price everything was taken now I wouldn't physically there right you know better than that yeah said when I brother there you made no I made the statement right we was in Jesus Christ that's right if we wasn't in Jesus Christ we never will be nowh anyway right because that's what he knew all right now get the point then there's only one Soul that's right that's Eternal amen right right there's not Souls that are Eternal right there's only one Eternal Soul right there're Souls yeah there's a world full of souls y all right that's why the scripture said All Souls are mine amen see he created them all right that's why we'll get back to more on it that's why that doesn't matter where you go in the world you find people trying to worship God why because they've got a soul but there's only one eternal life right right the only way you and I can have eternal life is for him to impart that eternal life into us that's right amen you said when I always was eternal I don't need anything well what are you talking about right what are you talking about amen you make an eternal sinner MH but you see folks I believe in the new birth I believe you must be born again I believe you come into the world me you all of us brother randam and all he's the one that said it so you argue with him he said he was born in sin shaved in iniquity went forth with his mother a liar and said doomed it on his way to hell and deserved it so now you argue with him y that's right but you see we want to make him something different no he was no if you make him any difference you got him God so you better be careful right he was different what God made him death yes right but he had to receive eternal life amen that's right and by doing that then that made his soul Eternal amen see William Brandon became Eternal amen cuz it was a time William Brandon wasn't Eternal but then he became Eternal that's right by accepting the life of God to come and live in him then that way I believe there's only one Soul that's ever come into the world that's Eternal right amen if I'm not a part of that the same way that I believe there's only one God mhm and if I'm not a part of that God y then I'm lost amen right that's right you said then brother Dale it gets confusing because these people say this and these say that I can't help that but I will quote you scripture there must needs be H sees among you that they that are approved may be made manifest you know it's put there for the purpose of the fact all of this confusion in the people of the message of what brother randam taught yeah you know or they say he taught yeah is there to try you y that's right you remember there in the Old Testament if a Prophet come and give you a sign and it come to pass that's one scripture you're supposed to believe him right right amen but there's another scripture said if a prophet comes and gives you a sign and it comes to pass and he leads you to another God another Doctrine or idea said Don't listen CA I done that to prove you that's right see we don't quote them scripture God loves to try children that's right amen he wants to see what you make out of yes you know that R around and said that God put Moses through all the trouble he went through you know why he said it have you ever read it he said because he didn't want to get down to the river Jordan or the Red Sea or wherever believe the Red Sea right he didn't want to get there and find out he had the wrong man right now that's what your Prophet had to say about that's right so he tried him over and over and over burn everything out of him after in the desert left him out there with a hotheaded woman yes the best thing could ever happened to it right that's not throwing off on women it's just a truth but he come out there the Bible said the meekest man on Earth so get on us sisters and wear us out make us Meek Danny said she does so just keep that in mind all right but do you understand what I'm saying now we'll get down to this to the questions and answers part so I believe that God paid a ransom that's right and if you'll find it this is Matthew 20 20 and 28 that God gave his life a ransom now if you go back and look at that and read just the word the words in the first part of that uh scripture it says the son of man right see God came down to give his life right now if you always was eternal what did he have to come and give his life for right what's the purpose that's right well I got the quote I know it but your quote is killing you y that's right cuz you're refusing to seek after God right you're blinding your own self but around didn't blind you it's mankind that's blinding you right we must be born again amen absolutely or else Jesus would have said to Nicodemus Nicodemus you believe the word he yet well you're born again that's you're saved you don't need nothing you always was eternal no he told him said you must be born again all right and see to receive eternal life means you die to yourself and accept his life that's right amen and his life comes in and makes your soul Eternal now that's right see I haven't got this far but I will later in the message now you're back where you should have been right amen when you receive eternal life your soul just as Eternal as it'll ever been that's right you know what that makes your soul back where it should have been to begin with prise the Lord exactly Jesus amen we should have come here with eternal life but we didn't get to because of the fall right but what's the difference see that's what people can't see they they can't understand that you could come into the world and be a mortal being and then God give that mortal being eternal life they got to come up with some devised plan that we always had it and I'm telling you you argue with me all you want to later I'm not against nobody I just tell it like it is you show me one of them doctrines and I'll show you every one of them went to the bed of adultery I'm talking about physical adulteries that's right now you name one of them that's right they went to physical adulteries polygamy and times would you tell me that's where you want to go all right see that was that Spirit on them that wouldn't accept the truth right that's right amen so then they go after the lies of the devil all right but you see Satan has tried his best to get us to see that he's God right that's what he wants us to believe right and if we accept his lie then we're making him God y right amen but you see we must receive eternal life but once we receive eternal life that eternal life is just as Eternal as God ever was because it's God's own life that's right all right then that's the soul that come from God Amen All Souls come by creation but God's children come into the world with a predestinated seed yes I believe that but is it a spot down in you what is it is there a little grain running around in the inch square compartment that the S says the bo of the Soul or is it just like I said when God said he created All Souls and that was before the foundation of the world in his mind that's right yes amen but did he make cubicles and set them up wait here it comes there it come it come cuz that's what your two Soul people said right and this is their doctorine I'm not throwing off I'm just telling you what it was to see maybe where we get caught into it the two Soul people taught it like this I know the man listened to it he said here it was baby fixing to be born okay James colle fixed to be born now this is what they describ and the baby was fixing to be born well God gets deterred off a little bit and something happens and he he he he missed missed it just a little and Satan beat him down oh now that's I'm not kidding you Satan beat God there like God was maybe he's you know oh oh oh here I got to go see how garbage cans get yes no Satan didn't beat God nowhere amen that's right the world we came in was in his domain that's where you got your your old nature and ways and Things by being born in this domain that we're born in that's right amen see cuz you and I didn't come like Adam right Adam was was had eternal life straight from God's breath right right but the breath of life into you and I just made us mortal beings right amen needing to be saved amen right but you see then what are we trying to get to he paid a ransom that we could be saved that's right he paid the price all we got to do is accepted pardon not a pardon let received is one right right but Brother D I believe all them quotes where the Prophet said always was eternal as I said keep reading the one you're talking about there's only one one that really comes down to where you wouldn't saved on no certain day is in uh future home I believe it's right but anyhow I keep reading the book I gave it to you that's right where he goes on over in the message and he said if you if you have eternal life you always was eternal right if you have eternal life remember I spent about three services on if you have eternal life right that's right if you have eternal life that means eternal life always was eternal that's right that's right and even showing you that there'll be a full virgin people one day get eternal life right that's right people will be given eternal life at the white Throne judgment true well do they have it now right no but brother I'm different yeah it's all right pride yourself all you want to it's going to be over with pretty quick right and then you going to find out that's right but you see I believe this 40 years ago and I believe it right now you must be born again that's right you must receive eternal life you know why I believe it cuz I received it I can talk about it cuz I received it right I wouldn't that I just come in the message I told you about it I was in the message two years before I received the new birth reading six books a day and listening to two tapes brother even told me when well you believe the message didn't you I said yeah but Paul said have you receed the gift of the Holy Ghost since you believe the message I say that to you and I right here today make sure that your calling an election is Right I'd still rather be seeking God that's good old Baptist you know no if I seek God that means I'm saying I don't have it I'd rather be seeking God and find out I've all had it all along let me quote brother random didn't the man that picked up the track and walked and went everywhere went to different places and different ones you need that quote when he come into the presence of brother Ram what did he say brother R told him said you had it all the time said you right there when you picked that track up yeah right he said you mean I've had it all alone he said yeah well you know what I believe brother R was right amen but I believe that man was seeking after God you know what God is looking at that man's desires right see church that's what it's based on eternal life amen must be received then it always was eternal always was eternal amen don't have to have no beginning and no ending to it it always was eternal right amen see I always was a child of God Amen but I certainly was lost yes that's right brother R said I found out that I wasn't the son of Charles and brown now what's he talking about he wasn't denying his mother and daddy that's right he was in the spiritual extent right that's right am y see that's where we got to trouble we'll get back to it this evening what is man and we'll see what's wrong with us where the problem is at and then we'll start from there and go back up through this Plan of Redemption because I believe we must be redeemed amen that's right I showed you there that your body where was it at Prophet said it was in the world when it was created all right so when Jesus red with there on the River Jordan what happens he this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell Y what did brother runet said this is my part of the earth that I redeemed and from this part of the earth I'll redeem the rest of it you know that we step ahead by the change of the body by the Redemption of this body we step ahead of the world cuz it's going to be at least another thousand years and then two short seasons in there that before the world is made Eternal but our bodies have stepped right out you know what the world's got to follow us it's got to follow us why because we're Eternal not going to blow it away and annihilate it but see we had all them doctrines now I'm going to say this and then I I'll get down the other you know I thought that we believed and I know this is going to go over real good but I thought we believe when brother brand said with the restoration of the word would come to Restoration of power you know what I say the problem of the people is the power reason the power is not in you and my the way it needs to be is because we don't believe it right that's right that's right but that don't change a thing that's right because with the restoration of the word God's got to keep his word that's right and the power of God is here it's just up to you and I to release it amen right well brother Dale there's plenty of sick among us right there must be sick among us oh my hey folks I keep saying it and you don't like it but we're getting older and with the older you get the sickness comes that's right then people say Well it don't have to no it don't but it does right and I don't want to stay in this pest house right that's right I'm beginning to get to the point that I'm sick of this old boy right but you see with the restation of the word but now you tell me if we haven't preached the word correctly how can you expect the power to come right amen so now if we don't understand predestination if we don't understand eternal life if we don't understand all of these things I've been talking about lately it must be showing the fact that we don't believe God's word or else brother Dale was wrong I've got enough sense to be able to figure that out right I may be 70 W be 71 just in a few days but I got enough sense to figure it out that if I haven't preached it correctly God's not underbound that's right but if I have he ain't underbound to me cuz it wasn't me that done it right he's underbound to what he said in his word it's up to you and I to believe it yes amen that's right well I want to see now you can't see to believe you got to believe to see if I could just get better I would I confess I'm Healed I I I'd say that i' healed if I just got better now that's no scripture for that that's right you're in a lie of the devil right same thing for salvation yes but I don't want to lie Brother D if I go around saying I'm saved and I ain't saved yeah well who said you wasn't I don't want to be AE about you know fact that that here I am I'm still sick what's that got to do with God's word right he said I'm Healed right amen let me say what he said like I said the other day was somebody about about the blind man you know brother R told him said you're healed he went off and he come back a day or two later come back sometime later the brother R him you know and he said I can't see you told me that I was healed he said now are you going to say what God says God says you're healed right you go say God what God said man standing out on the street and everybody laughing making fun of him right right extra extra Read All About It by Stripes I'm Healed I can see well you're just as blind today as you was yesterday you're making a mockery out of the Gospel but one day he was sitting in a barber's chair and the barber was making fun of him you know and said I thought you said you healed he said I am I can see and his eyes come open yeah well now what if he hadn't kept saying that that's right you know what he stayed blind till he died y but when he confessed it he just kept kept on confessing it well what's wrong with saying it one more time what's wrong with saying it one more time I'm Healed that's right but see that Old Devil come up you don't want to lie Satan you're the liar God said I'm Healed God says I'm saved let me go say I'm saved then Y what is what scripture say about let the redeem say so or something like that let's say What God Says then it's his responsibility that's right but like I told a brother the other day the scripture says you know repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission to sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but you know I never read there where it said when I was going to get it right have you have you ever read there the next verse does it say when you going to get it no it's when God wants you to have it but you got to say you got it that you're healed what happens when you call me all right somebody want to answer that one how you doing brother Dale wonderful wonderful well you mean you're not hurt I didn't say that I said I healed well I'm not going to say that brother cuz I'm just no I'm not feeling too good but let's keep your sickness that's right cuz you will cuz God can't do anything for you that's right and he can't save you if you don't confess it all right okay let's get on questions and answers I got a few written down we'll cover that and then we'll go from that so everybody get ready okay said did God dictate the descendants of those who chose not to be saved in other words did he set make Point dictates you know it determine all right now I know the quote but I know what's being used that brother R said he had to breed this one to this one to that and to this one that and to get you here I I agree with that that's right but now did he put it together through adultery and thing right you you see what I'm saying so did God dictate a lot of it or was it God's forn knowledge that would take place he didn't make it happen right it was his forn knowledge that so and so would be bred to so and so so and so would be BR to so and so to get you here y it would be his for knowledge more than he had to make this and do and run this over here and do see because you you truly can't say it about everybody I believe it's just plain out to the bases I'm just answering the best I can that it was necessary for them people to be back there that rejected Moses for them people to be standing there right you know with the Lord Jesus I agree amen but be careful how you're trying to make it when you say in the dictat see because that means that you're you're making it come that way that's right I I'd rather just put it to the bases that we got here say the person went on to say because he knew whatever person would look like or did he do that only for those who are literally part of him you so you could divide that it's all right you could say that he would choose and bring to make sure you got here correctly but still still don't put it on the basis of of choosing it as much as that he knew what would take place that's I'd rather approach it from him knowing it than for him to make it happen as we would try to read the quote and say that it's got to be this way I don't believe brother ROM a lot of time is saying things that's got to be this way right he saying what took place amen see so I I'd rather just leave it on that see and and that way you don't have to worry about it because then you don't get concerned with what has happened and that happened right thank God I got here right I thank God that my mom and daddy didn't believe in birth control no abortion no abortion cuz I'm the baby of 13 Y and I'm sure thank God they didn't believe in it yep cuz I might not have got here you know but you see you know I thank God I got here amen all right and if I'm the only one out of the 13 that would believe the message I thank God for that am right how he got me here thank God he did right he sure did all right when God created man in Genesis 1:26 was this why he said All Souls are mine then the one on said I've heard it was the the bride only okay now it wasn't that when he created man right you know in Genesis 126 I I don't believe Genesis 126 was all the souls that was ever created I'll get to that later I don't believe that I believe that was the soul of God Amen that's right right because it's the the Eternal God right amen all it's the one brother R we'll cover later so I believe that when Genesis 1 126 was made that is that one soul I talking about while ago that's right that's when he said made man see all right see one man right and that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's right and from there is where we're at but as far as all the rest see then that Souls that God created yeah he created everybody's Soul see put in there I heard it was the bride only I believe that I believe that Genesis 1:26 and 27 is only the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right yes sir you know every how you want to say that the bride because you got to tie in together those of the Old Testament that eventually come to it but just to put it to where we're at we'll hold it to the to the bride all right and then they went on to say he told them to to multiply and replenish the Earth he told him the same way as he did with Noah but now remember Genesis 126 and 27 is a spiritual creation right all right now so then that would be spiritual multiplication right amen correct the replenish word it says there in Genesis 12627 all to go and replenish the Earth it didn't mean to go out and fill the Earth with bodies that's right right it meant to go out and spiritually what are we doing today what was we talking about while ago that's right how are we imparting eternal life that's right how do you impart eternal life amen you raise your children in the correct way you teach them about God you give them a choice no I want to give them a choice to do what you want to don't give them a choice to do what they want to going to die and go to hell right that's right give them a choice to accept Jesus Christ right yeah but that's making them no that ain't making them it's laying it out in front of them letting them make the choice all right see so then to me now when it says in Genesis 126 and 27 they're about multiply and replenish that's not talking about physical bodies cuz there's no physical bodies di no that's right amen that's Genesis 1 that's a spiritual creation right Genesis 2 is the physical creation see then Noah was told to replenish the Earth because it was only the children of Noah and you know and his family and thing and see that would be where it would come down so then you got to divide the two amen one of is speaking of a physical creation you know physical replenishing MH or to bring forth again cu the original there see it says in replenishing people believe that that that meant there was people before right you know or some other civilization but it really doesn't mean that if you look original up it just means to feel or to stalk right it doesn't mean it's got to replenish because that would make something before it's not saying that it's talking about just a stocking of it all right now when I get through you can have any comments you want to on these but I'll just covering what what I got do you think the souls under the altar are breathing beings yeah I don't believe they're breathing beings like human beings are breathing because sold under the altar would you know let's take it away from one point let's don't have the Jews and the things sold under the altar cuz we'll get back to it brother brandom used it and the the angel of the Lord that with brother Brandon beyond the curtain of time said this is the scripture Souls under the altar right but now if you say how long how long that's Revelations over there you know the Jews to avenge our blood now you can't use it that way see so you're going to have to you have to divide that scripture right cuz if you use it to you know soul Under The Altar and just leave it everything no but Souls under the altar those beyond the curtain of time do you call them breathing beings or do you call them beings that are above breathing above all that brother BR said a hand greater than our hand an eye greater than your eye see it's a body yeah yes sir but it's not just say a breathing being because when you references the breathing beings you're talking about natural physical life right because in the other realm you wouldn't be saying well Breathe In Breathe Out breathe in breathe out you know no because it's so much more higher above that when we get to heaven we won't have to worry about breathing our brain won't have to tell our heart to beat it won't have to tell you to breathe something has to control you now so breathing being to me is referring to here they're not up there breathing cuz you don't have to breathe in that other dimension you know you say well they are breathing and then we'd have to Define what you mean breathing because I don't believe that you're having to stand out you know that's the reference to me of breathing you know it's so much higher until there's nowhere in the world they went on to say God didn't breathe into Adam until they became flesh well that's true God didn't breathe into Adam until the flesh was there right he didn't breathe into him somewhere else and he become he breathed into him after the flesh was brought then he became a living soul and was breathed the breath of eternal life into Adam right see so then your breathing would be more or less here all right so then one on the person went on to say part two of it was well they they become glorified flesh when we do for we're caught up together to meet him now everybody's not going up when we go up right right that's not it the Old Testament Saints are not going up when we go up in the Rapture the uh foolish virgins the people that will be given eternal life in the second Resurrection see that they will not be not will be they won't be glorified when we go up right see because that's that's not the point I'm just read reading the question like it says will they become glorified flesh when we do all right if that's talking about those beyond the curtain of time right you know as to to souls under the altar we sure we'll all go up together right all of us is going up together doesn't matter what age you're in you know whatever as long as you're ining new birth but it won't be everybody doesn't go up at the same time right you got a difference in in the going up time of it you know and all all right now could it be Adam's birth types Jesus's birth well that's all right I agree with that that's that's a good point that you know Adam's birth showing that Adam you know come into the world and God gave him eternal life showing that Jesus was born into the world and God breathed the breath of life into his nostrils I believe that right I don't believe that when he was in the womb that he was was you know the eternal life was there the soul was there I don't I believe it was when he come forth see and that's why brother random I love that that when he says you know that a baby is wiggling muscles he said but it's not a soul until it's born into the world and breathe that breath life I heard one the other day that and I looked at it again this morning I still want to try it but not doubting what he said and he's describing how that a child in the wound or an animal see an animal's in the wound it's the same way right but it's not a living Soul right but he said it's just like a horse High you put it in the water and it'll curl up any of you horse guys know anything about that that's what he said he said you put a horse in the water instead it'll wiggle around I didn't know that I know that frog legs will keep kicking but that's jerking muscles that's what it was I just happened to see that I better find out about this cuz he said you like a hire you put in the water and it'll move but see I believe the birth of the baby you know when God breathes into the nostrils of that baby it becomes a living Soul cuz it's not a living Soul while it's in the wom right right you can say well it's got Wiggly muscles it can feel pain it's all right so to animals right no difference in that part so to animals amen and I don't believe in abortion no sure around right don't agree agree with it amen but I believe there's cases where that it's better to you know take the child and it is to let it be born right right I agree with that now sure amen because that's you've got to have it in the right way that's why I'm glad brother random explain that that's right yes sir so you can say to somebody at the then well now you took that baby's life no you didn't take the baby's life cuz it wasn't live yet right I'm glad we had a prophet amen you that just that that's my thrill and is to know the truth Y and like I said while ago though if we don't search the message out then then it's our fa problem we got the message we got the computers we can search anything brother around and say it now that's right just an instant to search it out to see what he said about something thank God for all those things all now said could it be Adam's birth top Jesus's birth said he received eternal life and Jesus being God was eternal at his first breath let see I agree with that see this is different in the natural the breath gives the the breath gives the body now this is what the person St the breath gives the body life but the soul needs to be reborn through the word it byass I agree you know if you're listening to what said then see in the natural God gives breath to the child and that brings life to the body right but then we must have the new birth see and if we don't have that we've missed it all right and see then went on to say we're we have to be a full age like Adam was to understand the word that makes us glorified I agree that's that's what we have to see you can't reason with a baby I like that I guess that's why he made man first not a baby first you know the old argu the chicken or the egg you know they've argued and argu over on or now he made the chicken amen sure did he didn't make the egg and let it hatch he made the chicken you can't you can't reason with a baby that's they don't have reasoning factors that way they'll argue with you so will babies in Christ even argue with you you know and it's hard to deal with them because they'll argue with you about the point all right let me get one more then right says my body was never back in or with God but must be redeemed I agree I preached that part in there right I believe your body was in the earth yep but if you're going to have one to live in you're going to have to redeem it right we're not going to get a new one right and then the message people they still believe you're going to get a new body there's a lot of people believe that but I don't believe it I I just can't handle that I believe that you know Jesus's body come up with nail prints in it and I believe he'll have nail prints in it when we get there right CU it's the same body right you see to to me my body was back there in his for knowledge of my partaking of the revealed word that I bypass and becoming glorified that's that's good you know in his for knowledge he knew knew my body was coming so brother R said he put it in the Earth but he didn't put it this on what did he put in the earth and I like the way brother Brown says it even that our body is being this body redeemed I like the way he says it like I've always Illustrated what if you were in Africa and a line eat you up and they grab him real quick and they put him on a plane and they fly him to California and he goes and uses the restroom where's your body that's Carn oil but where's your body so brother R said not necessarily the same gases gases right see God don't have to bring all the same gases you know people do that and they'll put a cross somewhere and they'll put a sign somewhere somebody died here and all of that but you know over time the bulldozer is going to move that dirt somewhere else and where are you so it's not necessary the same gases he said but it's the same body absolutely amen you're going to stand in the same body you even The Sinner is going to stand in the same body he sinned in now I don't believe his body is going to come up 18 years old that's just a personal opinion I don't believe a sinner's coming up 18 years old and be judge I don't believe that but I believe you and I our bodies going to have to come back young again that's right so we're going to raise 18 years old or something but it's going to be in a glorified body amen this body made Eternal amen see and went on to say my body is redeemed to what he saw it at the final end of his plan he said because there's no time in God and I don't go back in body but manifest my part of his family right here I agree with that I believe that amen all right so we got D now anybody else somebody else got something we got a few minutes we can go we don't we pick it up this evening anybody got a comment or thought or want to question I'd like to say something about your body all right hold on just a minute let me let me get rid of this told somebody a while ago I Tred to keep my mouth shut that just you showed up toight uh you know I I deal with people it it's about every day and for some you you know we were we were T it was Apple on the tree and uh that's what somebody said that's not what it was but that'll be with us till the end and you know people say well flesh and blood won't inherit right no it don't inherit just goes along mhm but you know that and you might not like your body and what have you like that but you can't manifest the Lord Jesus Christ without a body Flesh and Blood exactly right exactly so that's that's what he put us here for that's mine you know and the the body is for the journey the body's for the ride we got to have one to live in I had a guy asked me the other day he says you mean and he done this you know this body this dust this going back to d i says I don't know you know but it's going to be your body mhm see people you know and it's it's it's a it's a Doctrine from way back they've been told just like you take the hell is eternal well see that's that's a Doctrine from way back right but when you find out that you have to be born again to be in Hell Eternal or in eternal hell or you know go the The Eternal has to be there right then that you know just logic right but uh I just I just want to say that about about the body I believe in the Redemption of the body right Jesus's body wasn't Eternal no it was created but one day it became Eternal right well then what's the problem with us we don't have to get a new one right want get a new one who else you going to look like I like myself I've pred him for 70 years now you know calming it and brushing it I don't want to get rid of I like the old dog who's next that's where I've always used next I've always said it wouldn't matter to me you know and I I I mean this and you know it cuz you know the way I talk play it wouldn't matter to me if I was black as s or as yellow as could be or whatever it is I thank God that he allowed me to live and allowed me to hear the truth y That's right to be able to accept it right you think about it sometimes what he had to do now even in the natural I mean we have a lot of people sitting here that was from different countries and even a lot of you was from different countries that didn't know you come from different countries did but you know look at at what it took for to bring us here that's right that gets me that's right amen then all this could happened we could hear and believe God's word that's right right exactly right from all over the world that we could come together right anybody anything all right I must have out talked to everybody done something so you know but we'll continue on we're not through with the message on predestination we're just really getting started you know but now we're going to start this evening we're going to drop back down here we're going to start over our journey travel let's stand together we just sing a word

that what our heart is trying to do and we're trying to express you help us now as we go eat a natural meal bring us back together this afternoon remember the sick among us because Lord you said it you said with the restoration of the word would come restoration of power so we're not worried about power apart from character because with the restoration of the word we become the character of almighty God and that way we can have patience to wait upon you to manifest yourself in your given time but yet we depend on you and we believe it because we know you are God and you change not forgive our sins lead us in thine understanding in Jesus name amen you dismiss take the
