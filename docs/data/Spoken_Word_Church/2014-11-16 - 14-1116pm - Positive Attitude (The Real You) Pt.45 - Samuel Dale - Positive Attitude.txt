TRANSCRIPT
========================================
sunday school was to sing today but since bob and monica not here i'll sing today they can sing next sunday i know not why gods want dress grace to me he hath made known nor why unworthy christ in love redeemed me for his on but i know whom i have believed and i'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which i've committed unto him against the day i know not how the faith to me he did impart nor how believing in his what wrought peace within my heart but i know i have believed and i'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which have committed unto him against that day i know not how the spirit moves convincing men of sin revealing jesus through the word creating faith in him i know not what of good or ill maybe for me off weary ways or golden days before his face i see but i know who i have believed and i'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which i've commented unto him against the day i know not when my lord may come at night or noon death air nor if i'll walk the veil with him or meet him in the air but i know hope i have believed and i'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which i've committed unto him against the day but i know hope i have believed and i'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which i've committed and to him before you don't need oh i've sung this before but i just don't think we can ever give him enough praise so well it was told that he would come and the race but when they laid him in the tomb the power of the lord came in the room now he raised yet he reigns forever by his stripes we are healed and by his blood we are sealed hallelujah to the land of god well bright he's coming back someday to take us home with him to stay his glory forever we'll share and when that last trophy sounds oh oh hallelujah we are healed and by his blood we are sealed hallelujah to the lamb of god sing the course hallelujah hallelujah amen amen open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want i holy holy shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love think about it amen just turn around and take a look at each other because that's where he's supposed to be at right amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you like turning your scriptures turn over to john 3. very familiar scripture with us you know i was thinking about and i want to do something in a minute kind of the natural to show what i'm talking about but i got to thinking about the scriptures and uh i just got to run into kind of a little reference to the scriptures there the other day and i thought well i'll just do it that way and i'll approach it from that and then we'll go on but remember now the bible study december the sixth saturday on that one you know december the 6th and remember the the uh what's not service on the 31st remember also the christmas time together on december the 14th only one service that day and so we get everything ready and getting it together and doing and then i really got a good one while ago you know i kind of got a little hard this morning i guess but it's it's in love so if you take it that way if you don't then just blame me for it but i was talking about you know i said where was you at yesterday i said where's it fellowship meeting i said i guess using walmart well one brother came up and he said brother dale i have to admit it i was in walmart yesterday that wasn't all he said but i was buying your christmas present that wasn't all he said i guess i'll have to take it back i said look if you're going to repent repent to me don't repent to walmart keep my christmas present you know no yes that's good that was a good point amen john 3 heavenly father we thank you lord for this day and your grace unto each one of us we thank you for loving us and caring for us lord thank you for saving us guiding us and leading us lord into your word we love you and we thank you we pray that you would just reach down and touch each one remember the ones that are not here lord the sick ones among us remember the different things lord sister audrey there that lord heard her shoulders and their things lord and we pray that you just reach down and touch her and all the rest lord and we thank you for being with each one and it's delivering us we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen i said very familiar scripture with all of us right john 3 there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god now brother brown says on the 4141 church age book he said jesus didn't say i'm a teacher he said because he didn't come for that he said he come to die he said but the holy spirit that would come would be the teacher you know and see i just write those things in my bible because to me i love them you know we know that the already teacher comes from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him jesus answered and said unto him verily verse i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god the original said unless it be born from above all right so jesus was saying you got to be born from where i come from see that was the confusing to nicodemus nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born to water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not that i said unto thee you must be born again now see he repeated that statement now remember if god ever repeats himself you pay attention when he says verily verily you stop and listen all right so what he said marvel that not that i say unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it lists us thou knowest the sound thereof but can't not tell once it cometh and whether it goes so is everyone that is born of the spirit of god amen you may be seated lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now i said i have a an odd way of approaching things but i got to thinking about this here and you know and tying it together and you know the whole bible is the plan of salvation amen redemption etc is in the word of god and uh you know after all of these years that the man had studied nicodemus now you know wade done a marvelous job on doing our wednesday night and maybe i shouldn't say it but i will anyway that the lord willing in january is going to run a series here upstairs here for the services as many services is necessary to putting together the statue of a perfect man into uh you know kind of like he's doing downstairs but more detail and that's why i just picked this up and i thought well here's something that's going to be very valuable because i saw something that i've never seen how it's done you know we talk about things but uh you know we talk about picking up a cup washing it using it and things like that but uh you know do we really understand what's taking place and you know it's not said there in the bible that nicodemus and jesus talked but i'm honest i'm you know as bad as i can be uh you can read here in just a few few minutes and then nicodemus is walking in he wants to see jesus he wants to talk to him he comes into his presence and jesus says you must be born again you never ever see your naked raider nicodemus now i don't think that happened i'm serious i don't think it happened that away i think they sat down and discussed a lot of things you know because he admitted that he was a teacher and you know and uh jesus recognized back to nicodemus that he was a teacher well they had a lot to talk about not just a uh a little 15-minute bid and then they went out the door and this might have went on for hours discussing the scriptures i always say it you know because it's funny to me not might not mean it to you but you know you said well brother dale you don't know they spent hours but you don't know they didn't so okay i'll just make my point you know what i'm talking about what if they discussed ezekiel 36 you know what if they discuss the scriptures you know and then nicodemus says but hey i know the scriptures you know surely nicodemus knew that he was going to call him a messiah right you know surely he knew all about ezekiel and the the talking about the new heart and the new spirit you know putting my spirit in you and surely he knew all of those scriptures and uh and i know brother mode and i not meaning we were both so smart but this meaning we talked a lot alike and thought a lot of like and we'd be going to work and me and him would be talking here on something and all at once we'd be way over here on another topic and one of the brothers riding one day said hold on just a minute you were going that way and now you're going that way well we could just we could do that we could just swap and just follow each other because we knew each other's kind of thought well that's what i'm talking about two teachers sitting down they didn't have a 15 minute talk or something they they sat there maybe for hours and talked about the things and nicodemus says well i know i know there's some things there that maybe i don't fully understand well that wasn't confusing even if jesus would have explained to him the the uh things you know but yet when the amazing part was when jesus said you must be born again now that was the catch they could he couldn't get because there was no writings per se or wording period in the old testament form of talking about a new birth as we read it you know and we see it but yet i got to think and i thought well what if they um what if they went through some scriptures and i just like to take them and i want to put them up here and remember my thought is that they spent a time together they were discussing the scriptures and uh you know maybe they discussed something like this go ahead brothers and let's get started start with jeremiah 31 and i want you to notice that you can put them all up together if you want to because we'll be reading and look what it says at the same time saith the lord will i be the god of all the families of israel and they shall be my people i thought lord about that scripture and i thought how many times did it say it like that you know so then we go to jeremiah 31 33 but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i'll put my law in their inward parts and i'll write it in their hearts now he's a little more expressing what he's seeing now he's bringing it into the inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god and they shall be my people but just notice the connection to always and they shall be my people those people back there believed you know i would love to go sit down with like rabbi richmond or some of those guys to just talk with them for hours you know of the things they're just not a fly-by-night or something they they study those scriptures you know and and they're always he said one time i remember saying it him saying it he said they're always interested in new things well see then you can see par paul on mars hill you know you can see all kind of things you know you know you can see how that people are always interested but look what he's doing now pick up the wording and watch jeremiah dealt down into the writing of the word getting into their hearts all right ezekiel picks it up and says 11 20 that they may walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and they shall be my people and watch and i will be their god now he's saying that in the ones before but he's not making it that personal see now he's coming down to make it more personal ezekiel 37 27 my tabernacle also shall be with them yea i will be their god and they shall be my people all right zechariah 8 and 8 and i'll bring them and they shall dwell in the midst of jerusalem and they shall be my people and i will be their god in truth and righteousness jeremiah 24 and 7 says and i'll give them and heart to know me you notice when i'm picking it up just following the lineup off you know just seeing they shall see might be my people and just follow that line up he's talking about the word in their heart now look what he's talking about i will as wade was bringing out the other wednesday give them a heart to know me you know if god don't give us a heart to know him we we can't know him it's his choosing remember remember that if he don't call us we can't come i'll give them in heart to know me that i am the lord and they shall be my people and i'll be their god for they shall return unto me with their whole heart just thinking about the things now to what that we we talk about and to get into knowing more as i said and god just gradually unveils well see maybe jesus was talking to nicodemus and he said nicodemus you know the scripture says this the scripture he says yes and here's this one here's that one here's this one and they just they're having a wonderful time discussing the scriptures and the meaning of what things were are you know and maybe jesus was saying nicodemus remember now it it does get down in there to talk about the heart you know it gets down to talking about the knowing of god and the heart and how the heart of man is not the thumping gizzard we call the one you can replace well that's what everybody's worried about they're worried about where to go and get a heart transplant because they're worried that they might get somebody else's heart or soul you know i've always said i want a brain transplant but now make sure you get the right one i don't want somebody as old as i am to get another brain you know but you understand what i'm trying to make the point that they're discussing the scriptures and the scriptures are coming into view and nicodemus is discussing it with him and he's saying nicodemus you know there's got to be a uh a savior born yes i know those scriptures i know well you know the things that you're talking about and we're looking for the messiah to come and time goes on and as it goes on he stops and he says now nicodemus you remember there in ezekiel remember he says he must be born again nicodemus he says with nicodemus don't you know the bible speaks with these things he says yes we said we have our preconceived ideal because remember now the scriptures that i gave are all naturally related to the restoration of israel you know and them being into captivity and coming back and doing and and even the prophecies of the future and our nicodemus could say yes i know we're right in that time that we're under captivity to these romans and there's going to be a time that we're going to go out and we're going to be the people of god we said we are the people of god here in captivity you know but it'll have to take a time and jesus would say to him yeah but nicodemus look all of that was natural now maybe it'll help you to understand that scripture and he says if i speak to you of natural things and you don't understand because really see he or understood the natural things type the spiritual things is that the way we've been taught the natural type in the spiritual so he's saying nicodemus follow this line and look at look at ezekiel look at these about the new heart and your spirit yet you don't understand why i said you must be born again so doesn't that seemingly put you in a position that like something's got to happen to you and it's not just a total outward happening it's got to be an inward uh working you know well now you're beginning to get confusing to nicodemus because nicodemus is taught we are the people of god what else could we do to be the people of god what else would we want to be than to be the people of god and see jesus spoke throughout his whole ministry about it and he does there about the kingdom but you can't see it when nicodemus says all we want is to whoop these romans and take over sure there'll be an end to the world and sure we're going to be judged and sure there's going to be a resurrection you know but he couldn't follow the line then when jesus said it see you must be born from above because that's what nicodemus understood him to be saying we read it as he must be born again see nicodemus knew exactly what the man was saying he said what do you mean you got to be born from above he said my kingdom is none of this earth is that putting together a lot of scriptures that maybe they discussed my kingdom is not of this earth my kingdom is from above i came from above and you must be born from where i came from nicodemus says you're already getting rough now because we remember your mom and daddy you know but he said nicodemus don't you remember you was probably standing there today that my mom came in hunting for me and said your father and i maybe he was some of those lawyers and doctors and people that were standing there you know because that's what they're doing i i get to thinking about that sometimes i think well why wouldn't that be nice wouldn't it be something that all you do is you get up in the morning and all day long you just think about god you talk about god you go to bed at night you think about god you talk about god well see some of the people stood out and amazing and i listened to brother branham you just think about it you remember gamalia gamaya was the one i believe that said what you'll be happily fighting humor nicodemus one you know said you better leave this alone said you'll be fighting against god all right and see the man seen something but his eyes could not be opened because the spirit of god had not been given to comprehend all right so he he goes to that point of talking with the lord jesus and in that conversation you know that he says but look i know you're right but i just can't follow you church i've done that and been there you talk to people and try to get them to see what you're talking about you try to get them to see the message the things of god daniel 70 weeks the seals the different things and you sit there and look at them and you you know these are well-trained people you know some older than i was and the things you know and you think about why can't they see it you know and each one of you can think the same way remember the people you talk to and you try your best to help them in love and understanding but they just walk away from you not that they hate you or or anything they just can't understand you you're speaking from somewhere else they are only natural because irregardless the best you could do in organized religion and the biggest portion of people in the message they still have their mindset on something natural something you know here all right it looked like nicodemus could have understood because why not compare john 3 with ezekiel 36. right you must be born to water and a spirit well over here you've got you know you're dealing with three things all over in ezekiel you're dealing with three things this marvelous way wade was bringing it out wednesday see and i just thought well it's a maybe a good time to do this and then when something clicked i said well okay i know he's planning on going into this and yeah i'll get my part out of the way now and then i won't preach on the rest of the year so you know but think about it it's easy for israel to think about something natural if jesus had said to nicodemus nicodemus don't you realize one of these days we jews will rule the world oh nicodemus or he'd come up you know but it's always a natural thing to them let's go talk to the people of the world and try to show them the message of the hour and they'll go to the natural every time right i mean but they can't help it we're not throwing off on them thank god for god opening our eyes right that we may see all right well let's go to number seven there and just get a little point i just want to say a few things and then i want to get into some other things and illustrate a little bit but it's after you get up so far looks like people will begin to understand look at ezekiel 32 behold i will gather them out of all countries which will be a natural thing right but remember the natural of the gathering and coming back to israel is only speaking of the spiritual which is the 144 thousand that come into redemption and even israel as a nation going into the millennium and the things they're greater things than just occupying land and doing them behold i will gather them out of all the countries whether i've driven them in my anger and in my fury in great wrath and i will bring them again unto this place and i'll cause them to dwell safely once and they shall be my people is that that statement again and i will be their god i will give them one heart in one way jesus said i'm the way the truth of the life that they may fear me forever for the good of them and their children after them i will make an everlasting covenant with them that i will not turn away from them to thee to do them good but i will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me now he's going to enter into the man right into his heart i'll rejoice over them that do good and i would plant them in their land but surely with my whole heart and with my whole soul now uh-oh now he's not talking about theirs right you get it plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul now he's bringing it down to and i believe don't you that jesus is the heart and soul of god don't you don't you believe that that's who he was see now he's beginning to into the scriptures but now look drop back now ezekiel 11 17 therefore say thus saith the lord god i will gather them from the people and assemble them out of the countries where they have been scattered and i'll give you the land of israel and they shall come hither remember he did do that right and they shall come to the other and they shall take away all the detestable things are of and all the abominations are from thence and i will give them one heart he's going to give remember before my whole heart my soul right you remember the scripture before you know my heart my soul now look what he's saying and i'll give them one heart all right and i will put a new spirit within you and i'll take away their stony heart out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh now he don't take the heart out put another one in he simply softens that heart are you with me to take out the stony heart and put in a heart of flesh is a simple matter to me of saying i'll take away your stoning your hardness your arrogance your your doings and i'll give you a heart of flesh political soft nice he simply takes us and he works on us right give you a heart that's correct you'll remember you can't have the new birth until you come this away amen what that they may walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and they shall be my people there it is again right and i will be their god but it's for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations i will recompense their way upon their own heads with the lord if god didn't give us a soft heart right how could he save us right ezekiel 18. see this building up to 36 all right cast away from you all your transgressions whereby you have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit first he said i'll do it now he says you're doing it right come on and make you a new heart and your spirit for why will you die house of israel i have no pleasure in the death of that all right but look i can't i can't do anything the bible says the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance brother branham says once in contact right once you contact the supernatural he said you'll never be the same the day i saw him in that church i wish i could have got somebody to led me to him but i had no one that could lead me there he said well you mean important well they couldn't but from that day on i had a change of heart take away the stony heart is that ezekiel 36 when we get on into the scriptures but look make you a new heart well i can't do nothing save myself no but you can quit acting like the devil because he don't need no help lord comes along trying to help you see like i said if i had somebody i've told you you don't believe it i'm sure but i told you that even when i got into sin it's coming on up as a child that i'd do things wrong and i'd re i would say god you know i didn't know to say god or this i just i don't want to act like this sure into pleasures for a moment well what good are pleasures for a moment when you got the rest of the day amen right you got to live yourself for a while i just don't understand how people could slap a little child and just wham you know just stop them or kill people or do something like that i don't understand that because i had no thoughts like that when i was a sinner huh so i i think it's it's wonderful for you to try you know well ain't no need me trying ain't no need you're trying to work you know i mean your sisters well i don't understand it i don't understand that about hiring a dress well i'll just get you a playboy magazine and let you see some stories i don't mean to be nasty hateful you don't see prostitutes with short hire bob dolph and everything else right what's the sign of a woman oh ball head wrong bathroom right i mean you go to the bathroom what's on the bathroom anywhere you can read or what you can do you look on the bathroom and you tell which one of them to go into and it all got higher maybe not way down but they've got her and they got a dress on them well you know i mean we don't have to lay down and just do what the devil wants us to do i didn't drink kids sure we puffed the smoke probably smoked maybe half a dozen cigarettes my whole life only loved uh cigars maybe five and i've done that as a sinner and i don't understand it because number one i couldn't afford it i went to work i told you the first paycheck i got i had a tooth that was just killing me i went to the dentist i made a down payment on my mother a set of teeth from my first paycheck at 15 years old she had her teeth pulled but couldn't afford to my teeth i really couldn't afford to drink but you know what then i said i don't want it never used to get me when the boys would come in and say boy i got drunk life now i had a time but i don't remember what i'd done i said i didn't get drunk and i know what i'd done right but you see that's what we we do that's why it says make you work on yourself a little bit well was it wednesday night wade was talking about well brother brown said you've got a stingy spirit give it away right you got any kind of a problem it's going the opposite direction right keep you out of trouble i was a kid i kind of liked my face it wasn't too pretty but i wanted it to stay in the place it was and arranged the way it was and i've seen a lot of people run their mouth with big old long cuss words and they wound up bloody all over well you know what say what you want to i think i was doing a pretty good job of being a decent guy brother dale i just well okay that's you i'm just describing that it can be done not telling you what you had to do because all of us are saved by grace paul said i'm the chiefest of sinners brother conley i said that one night he got up later he said brother dale ain't never been like the rest of us he'll not be saying that i said yeah but see i know i know how close it is i know how close it is to walk in a good life and not be saved why don't you do a little working on your own shoulder thanks that will made me do it well you volunteered right right now you didn't see me at the honky as tonk sinner number one i couldn't afford it number two i looked at those things and i've seen those people and the way they act you may have thought it was nice and where all drunk the only person i offered to whip in my day was three boys they told i was drunk i said one at the time or all three i said god i don't do it i don't drink everybody thinks it's so wonderful you know no i don't like to be nasty but i had a brother-in-law that he went to a lot of parties he didn't get as drunk as the rest of them so we had every girl there plain language you can do some good things well that's working out my salvation no all of that didn't save me god remember you're looking at a boy that spent 10 years in the baptist church five as a deacon and come out of there not born again till i come in this message don't play your pity patterns with me it don't work but think about it now let's look at this for a second that i said i don't want to spend much time on what i'm doing but be alright if i preach to five o'clock i ain't preaching much lately okay we look at ezekiel 36 let's just think about it wade little marvelous and he'll get back to this he talks about bringing them to their land which have said that's a natural thing they were coming back to their land that was natural and he said i'll sprinkle you with clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and all your idols well i cleanse you now he deals with something else a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i'll take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i'll give you a heart of flesh i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statures and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in the land that i gave to your father here's that scripture again and you shall be my people and i'll be your god amen try running something like that through the bible sometimes with your concordances and just read them and watch how many times this has been said it just comes out wonderful doesn't he all right but watch now what's the order the prophet said and we won't spend but a second on it what's the order of it a new heart will also i give you and your spirit will i put within you i'll take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i'll give you a heart of flesh now and i will put my spirit within you all right now most people think that they take this is the new heart and the new spirit they think that's salvation it's working on you but that's not the holy spirit when he even says and i'll give you a new spirit that's not the holy spirit but ron says you can't even live with yourself i've seen people that were so miserable i guess if i'd have been as miserable as they would i'd have got drunk every day but i've seen people that are so miserable i see people now in this message it's just i mean it's so miserable what's wrong well you ain't been done like i've been doing well wowzy wowsy woo you've never been treated the way i've been treated with what does that make you right well see i give you a new heart and your spirit we won't go through them but you know that wade gave him wednesday if you need it what does it take to make a christian he says i'll give you a new heart and i give you a new spirit all right and i'll take away your stony heart out of your flesh and i'll give you a heart of flesh all right now that's justification and sanctification right justification and sanctification and then i'll put my spirit in you that's the holy spirit all right see then justification is when your sins are chopped off right and when it does you come to sanctification cleansing and setting aside and there's where you come up with that new spirit and that new heart part and we're talking about heart we're not talking about gizzards right soul soul of mankind is the heart of mankind that's what you are all right but here's where i think that most people miss it because they've always got to have some kind of uh a doings and uh something that they can figure out that they think it makes it look right but i've got to express this where to be on here when you start talking about soul body spirit etc just remember how we've always taught you up until 1962 on the greatest battle ever fought up to that point brother branham basically covers body soul spirit all right he uses it interchangeably at times but yet that's the basics of his speaking that the three circles that we look at so go ahead and pull that up brother on the circles we'll use that to start with because they're doing a marvelous job they got some things in here that wade can use later but just pull up the one where it shows and the you know the thing but remember after 62 then he covers body spirit and soul all right you know what i believe that is that is the opening of the word to the prophet you know what but i've always told you now anybody on the internet listening go back and check it he would go body soul spirit then he made it in the last days body spirit soul but you check it and see if i'm right he never changed the senses of the position he was talking about first position body would be see taste filled smell in your right so here we got it see taste filled smelling here always give five senses for the body the second realm no matter what he called it heart head brain whatever soul spirit he always gave that five senses all right what was it imagination conscious memory reasoning affection and he always gave the center realm only one sense i can show you these that's greatest battle ever fought where he says his faith or doubt it's not faith and doubt that would put the devil inside of the soul of man along with god that's why i can't follow the doctrine of all these seed things i know what brother branham taught amen amen but you put god and the devil in the same place you got a problem because my bible says god will not dwell in an unclean vessel yes you don't care what the bible says it's like i've always said everybody says the soul is just the nature of the spirit i want that quote boy to see people sitting down at the top writer they're getting ready to do it but remember i want the quote as he said it brother branham never say it the soul is just the nature of the spirit i want to quote he said the soul is the nature of the spirit well that's all the same thing no it ain't soul is the nature of the spirit that can be made something but if it's just the nature of the spirit it's like a dog or a cat or anything you can't put it in the correct order but see your two soul people they quote that around the world that the soul is just the nature of there is no quote but that makes me a sarcastic arrogant hateful oh dude thank you now what are you gonna do we see it's faith or doubt that's what he says on blasphemy oh the greatest battle ever fought one of them dominates you he said because god and the devil can't be in there at the same time he can't be in your soul at the same time now remember you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit you're born again in your soul justification works from in here that's where you sin from sanctification works from in here that's where you're dirty at no no no no you're dirty it works from there into here right you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit you're born again in your soul brethren says on children in prison the nature of that soul is god if you are born again said if not it is of the world you do what you want to well i got it figured out this way well let's see you figure it out people will take three objects and they'll put this object and then they'll put that object inside of that object and that inside of that object and whatever you're doing if one of them is body nothing spirit not soul you're trying to be your best to save each one but it's very very simple if you take it correctly and remember what happened to you you're not born again in your body i wish we were amen you're not born again in your spirit i wish we were let me quote brother used to quote it was a good one he said i wish we were baptized with the holy spirit on our brain you know but it won't work here's salvation this is the works and manifestation of the individual you can't sin with this body it has no ability to sin it in the head put it asleep you do what you want to and then go by you you're getting closer when you're getting into the memory reasoning conscience but here's where the old man's at here's what's causing us to do it from the inside because remember the three rings now keep that in mind the three rings is the key to understand brother random in the way he's talking all right now let me show you something simple that i'd like you to do and i am going to have to use three objects because my wife said you ain't pouring water all over the platform she said you get up there and start pouring this out of that into that said you're gonna have a mess that's okay honey i won't do it but i want you to think about very little simple something there you are body spirit and soul now i ask you a question sister gayle here we go that's coke in here to make it look black is that black coke inside that bottle or outside of it well i know it is because i seen you set it up but remember optical illusions i can set a device there that runs that on the outside as well as on the inside he said what are you getting at hold on hold on think about it you see that's the quote brother when it weighed gave wednesday and then north at night pull up number 19 brother we do need that one look number 19. it's often north at night 1965 paragraph 1 20 through 124. all right i may have to drink one of these bottles in a minute we might empty one of them but that's all right remember now this is 1965. this outside man is the flesh that's what we look at what we see where he stands now this outside man is a flesh that's what we look at what we see and it has five inlets to that body and any grammar school can go through it you know five senses what see tasteful smell here without that you can't touch nobody touch the body that's the only way you have to the body see tastes filled now this is the evil one on the outside so they're before you as a bottle and i hope they can pull it in without bouncing off of things to look at it that's as black as can be that was me i'll say it that way because you that don't believe it you don't want to put yourself there that was me as a sinner body spirit and soul you can't tell whether it's inside or outside because it's all together as one person me let's read it now inside of that is a spirit which you become when you're born into the earth and you breathe the breath of life he's breathed to you into him that spirit is of a worldly nature because it was not given from god not but it was given permitted by god a sinful spirit can't come from god forget it all right now you got that and every child that's born in the world is born in sin shape it in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and right so that person inside there is a sinner amen to begin with that's me a full product of satan's domain that god permitted to happen to where he could save me but that's me my body was of the world the nature of my spirit was of the devil and my soul was lost and needed salvation don't try to do no white washings remember i read that this morning no white wars that is you that's me totally now here's the key to what's the point so what does he get to conscious remember you can't think without it all your faculties all that works all right but your spirit can still reason five senses that controls that inside man now the last man which is the soul that's it there is only one sense that controls that and that is free moral agency free will will to choose or to reject up until the age of accountability i will not deal with what this was or what that says that we're just going to start where we start at because up until then god didn't credit it but still the bible says born in sin shaping an iniquity spousal mother's womb go forth a liar every person the prophet said whether it was priest king prophet or whom all right in the book of let's get back to my notes when somebody help me broken ruth in the book of ruth you'll find that there's one closer kin to ruth than boaz was and brother branham says that fellow represented the devil in top you know what you and i was born in satan's domain now i want you to show me where you're going to put these little white dots these little seeds if you put it in there you are the one dealing with it i know out on the internet you're listening you'll probably flick this off forget it but you've got all them seed doctrines put it in that bottle and i'll quote the scripture god won't dwell in an unclean but vessel see we don't care what the truth is we've got our own little belief well i want it in the bible and i want it in the prophet's message he said if you have eternal life you always was eternal you know why because eternal life is eternal life but he says you were lost and doomed and on the way to hell right here black is soot no whites no spots black is stuck all right so now what do you do you remember the story that he gave on the future home when he gets in the future home he gives you an understanding that's on kinsman redeemer paragraph 178 first you belong to him because you're his property where he was born in sin shaping him all right but you see this is what we need right that shouldn't be no light bulb turned on that ought to be sensible so we're not going to pour this out and put that in we're going to take this another way that was me before i was born again and i'm going to say this the way i mean it because i got another bottle this is me getting ready for a change are you listening so where am i at now brother dale right here hope that shows up enough on the screens and showing it there's some lines drawn in there that is in your body and your spirit the inside is perfectly totally pure but the body and the spirit is still in satan's domain and subject to all of them little things so i drawed it with a you little stripes in the body that's not on the inside all right well brother dale then how do we get rid of these stripes because you said this is what we need it to be now you think there's not a revival going on you think something ain't taking place you see when we walk off of here in the rapture after understanding what's taking place with the statue of a perfect man that's what we're going to be we're going to be pure and white and lily but just remember i have to put the guys up together but just remember that was me that was totally body spirit and soul lost and doomed it on the way to hell god came down put a new birth inside that's the same guy that's why i would have poured him out but you know that's the same guy but he's gone through justification sanctification in the baptism of the holy ghost and you notice i didn't leave it dark out here just left stripes because at the new birth we ain't supposed to be living like the devil right that's you that's me but when we leave here that's what we'll be not three bottles same bottle same person that's me that's me after the new birth that i've still got some problems but this is the man i longed to be you know what all the same old man except for regeneration i chose to use the same type of bottles or at least we could stay with that much but i hope you understand what i'm talking about that was me before body spirit and soul lost that's me getting ready to go in the rapture body spirit and soul saved that's what the new birth does that's what it takes place all right you can read the message but i want to give a couple more little drawings i'll leave that up there to show but but around used another illustration remember this was the illustration that he used all right we can go through it wade went through it you can show where that the cup was out in the yard dirty everything right you don't pick up the cup and put it in service you pick it up that's justification you got a reason for it all right you cleanse it with water you know boil it that sanctification and took this out because that goes all the way to the inside of the individual because you're not born again in your body why don't you quit trying to work on that fella why don't you get in god and let him work on from the inside out but you pick up the bottle you don't put it in service you wash it be careful on that washing because there is a scripture that a lot of people don't want to deal with the bible speaks of the holy ghost and fire you remember that holy ghost and fire see the pentecostal that was a holy ghost and then a great fire coming you know brother branham says when the holy ghost comes in he burns all of you out right he burns you out puts his own life in the same bottle the same person oh without here at this computer brain but i'm not the same person i found out i was always was eternal that makes people just get tiddly little ice pimples all over you makes you feel so good go right ahead you're headed for the tribulation i think what the prophet's talking about see you a bunch of preachers out there you know it's not because you know you face the truth i've taught this for 40 something years ever since i come in the message pick up the glass he says you're not right yet he said wash the glass he said jesus then says the unclean spirit goeth out of a man and walketh in dry places see then that's what i would do here i would pour this out see shake it out real clean fill it back up with water shake it rest and find it's done come back to the house find it swept and garnished entered in the state of the person is seven times worse all right let's use another illustration go ahead with number 23. rather if you'll notice there's a lot left out of here so this was taken from the future home 1964. 8 20. he's drawing he says let's take this board a minute brother around draws illustration or on the blackboard now here is a human heart and i'm not a long ways from being an artist you're the human heart here's a human heart now to me if you're going to redeem it means to redeem it don't mean throw one away and get you something else right now watch it here's a whole new heart here's one this one here has snake that's sin he has his life remember that this one over here has a dove in it which is the holy spirit he has a life well this one here has snake what has malice hatred envy that's what's causing it is this fellow here well this one over here has love joy long suffering that's what does it all right so when you're asked or you are forgiven of your sins you've only done this taken that away he takes out sin but the thing that made you do it we'll show it in a draw in just a minute he put sin and he put a snake he said thing made you do it still there that's the old root of evil is still there notice then you repent and be baptized name of jesus christ i forgave you of your sin notice then secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for holiness to think right taking away sanctification greek compound then next comes the baptism of the holy ghost the fire of god cleanses when that holy ghost comes in you at your new birth the fire is preceding the holy ghost it's not following the holy ghost it's not holy ghost and then a fire the fire precedes the holy ghost to burn out anything left right anything left see next time the baptism is no longer fire and holy god and god might dwell in us the fire of god cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the holy ghost inside and we bring forth the same life now the white brothers would pull up that little draw in it we've tried to make but you remember as this is one man this was us as lost doomed in on the way to hell this is what we look like when god gets through with us in regeneration now regeneration means i didn't throw the cup away remember i'm supposed to pour that over into here i didn't throw the cup away i redeemed the cup you realize brother brown says that even today you get the holy ghost wait a minute today you're sanctified he said say i said god lays a claim on your body the day you're sanctified he lays a claim on that body why because you ain't gonna get a new one so look what he does this is before the new birth this is the solar heart prophet said this is sin here's the snake and said here's his life you remember the quote see malice hatred envy is inside of it now take that same heart and convert it show the next one i wrote it where it would come up after the new birth dove love joy long sufferings it's the same heart it's the same person he's just redeemed redeemed don't mean to throw away you throw something away i don't know i don't know your whole body no more well then where are you going to get one oh i'm going to get a new one i want bible for it and i want to profit for it but a lot of people make that statement and you don't know what they mean brother did last night go get a new body well you don't know what they mean right i can say to you here as a church i believe in getting a new body all of you will raise your hand and say amen right go you know what i've taught it is not another one it's this body made new in regeneration in redemption the soul of man put the dove inside the man i want to make another drawing that brother branham didn't make but i want to put it all together so go ahead and show the last one we'll get through it there to me is what we need you understand what we started off with we started off with three round circles the body spirit soul you born again experience puts christ in you the hope of glory this man when he becomes redeemed it's the same man he's just redeemed but i'm not the man i used to be that's good songs and good things you say well i don't understand this about the lines in there but it's still there paul said the things i do i would not or would not he said if not said what it is he said it's sin in my body is that what he said he said so then with my body i served the law of sin not meaning he was a sinner inside the body and the spirit but one day the body and spirit is going to be one i started off with one lost here we are one redeemed taking the heart taking the things and talking about jesus christ and what he's done for you and i why do we need all of these other things everybody wants yeah but i just don't hear now here's what you do and you watch what i'm saying so get ready on internet you people out there see what you do is you don't want nothing we have become so spiritually minded as being in the message until we don't want to follow after what somebody else says we've got to figure it out we got to get it ourselves when a man told brother moat one time i'm old mentioned speaking on the statue of a perfect man and rapture and where it comes what ages don't tell me i want to study it out myself he came back about i forgot maybe three six months later you know what he done he preached the rapture was going to come because brother brown and made a statement that the rapture would come in the brother of the kindness age and he brought in philadelphia as brotherly kindness so he brought it all the way back down here to the sixth church age and said the rapture is coming in philadelphia sixth church angel because philadelphia means what brother dick brotherly kindness well you know brother branham he didn't even know that no he wasn't talking about cities and what they meant he's talking about the word of god but the brother said the rapture is coming in the sixth church age i said you know what brother mo he wasted a lot of time that's dirty and i said he wasted a lot of time but you know what i'm as honest as i can be without trying to be arrogant or hateful or smart eloquently but you know a lot of people if they just listen to some of these brothers around here preach they wouldn't have to study for a message they'd get all they wanted right but they ain't gonna do that i gotta get it myself i'm the one that came up with this i'm the one that started the two soul the seventh hundred verse of peru right brother dale ain't trying to start nothing i'm trying to get back to the original brother branham is the one i'm reading from and if i've misread something to you about what he said i want to know about it but if i've read what he said and just put an illustration to it you tell me what he's talking about when he said here's a heart and here's a heart he's showing that and over there is lost he's saying this and saved what is it same heart soul that's why i made the life straw and put it in our soul i believe in redemption i believe we're being born again don't you we're being redeemed come on musicians we're being born again we're being saved i hope you understood what i brought the last one comes and that's where way will fit in the statue of a perfect man is going to take all these lines out there will be no lines left when that man walks off the earth you say you mean you talking about sinless perfection now i'm talking about sinless god right because i thought the prophet said may i quoted listen he's coming back after a church that's perfect that's what i thought he said well if perfect perfect has got to mean ain't nothing wrong with it ain't no lines left what do you think about it i'm talking about the real you the real you that started out in sin that's where we started body spirit soul totally lost but he comes down and don't leave out nothing and redeems body spirit and soul you got the same person you don't have to have three or four cups and do you just know what you're doing know what to look forward to let's stand together what we got brother still we are the people of god fulfilled in our day i left out one but you you just read it when you get a change it's in corinthians when you get into corinthians i'll find it in a minute you know what it'll wind up being the gentiles the gentiles get the same scripture well go ahead and sing i'll find it just lord you are paul smith second corinthians 2 corinthians 6 16 and 18. read it and see if it don't have the same thing about being the children of god and that we're going to go through this soul spirit and body we're going to go through it and we're going to be made pure you see it wasn't just speaking of israel speaking of us too beautiful with endings let me see if i can find that and read it king james right and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people same thing he said in the old testament wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i'll receive and i will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters same scripture we started in the old testament winds up in the new testament we are the end of all things think about it go ahead brother and father anybody have a need i will reign we are his offspring think about him what he's done for us redeem means to bring back that i have to make something else to make us feel it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people the sheep of his pasture we are the people of god why wouldn't that create a revival why not lord jesus we thank you we just ask you to be with us now i pray that what we said would be helpful we've tried lord well we just ask you to go with us now on our way home and just take care of the people and bless us together in you lord give everybody a safe journey maybe they're sick among us because you promised it you sent your word and healed us and we believe it have your way now forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness in jesus name amen you dismiss us
