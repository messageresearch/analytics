that we have what a time that it is for us to realize realization and who we are and what we're doing here father your prophet said when the bride realizes who she is once she's fought here for she'll be an invincible army so just help us to understand Lord give us this day our daily bread that we may eat that part that we may feast in you we love you and we thank you we committed to you now in Jesus name visions one there you go thank you this is Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are in Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ this it be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings we're at now in heavenly places in Christ what's the believers position heavenly places right according as he has chosen us in him now remember we didn't use him as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will now what's the mystery of his will to adopt us right that was the mystery from all the way now watching this we come down from Genesis according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and him also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted watch not after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of his word now I've told you before you take Ephesians 1 you can preach anywhere in the Bible and bring your thought right out of Ephesians 1 and all the night you know maybe we'll get into that part of doing it but just remember that now and keep it to keep it in that that part to where that we can understand our background just still a little bit for this morning and then move into where we're at in the afternoon all right here so remember what we were talking about that there's three stages of adoption the new birth the Statue of a perfect man the growth development etc and then the adoption to wit the redemption of the body all right now what is the thing down through there that has been left on or had not come forth or the Prophet said headstone hadn't come back in the early ministry talking about that and we know that the cornerstone was a revelation of Jesus Christ built on the foundations of apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone alright then the headstone you know would be the opening of the entire word which would be the seals from revelation 6 because that's what Jesus preached in Matthew 24 alright so then you have that all indirect to lay into order and that's what I was asking you are getting you to try to get you to think the Lord Jesus he didn't have to be adopted and now he went through these things as an example he didn't have to do these things he didn't have to do this that you know it's an example to even me so their own two old lead Jordan River the Lord Jesus started his ministry he received from Dyer the Commission to go forth and bring those things and an example are set forth as him as to being the child of God or son of God all right and and it's he said verse this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell alright that's a wonderful position but do you realize that each born-again believer yeah see that's why so hard for me to background-color preach the whole message do you realize each born-again believer that God said I'm pleased to dwell no no no well he's not there then I mean it can I put it that away and it be understood correctly if he's in there he's pleased to dwell or he wouldn't be there he's not going to give you the new birth contrary to the word he's not going to give the new birth just because somebody says I've got the new birth that that doesn't mean a thing that's that's our problem that's her ideas you know that we get into in in life all right but see he said dark this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell all right he had three years of going through all right we'll read him in just a second to work that you'll have it because we had to cut short this morning and still run out but he had three years of the most horrible ministry as we've called it our life constantly trying to kill him trying to do everything about it you know doing everything they could to hinder him and then he goes to Mount of Transfiguration well see you're going through and following his life through you know there and seeing how that he's done this and he's done that and he's he's you know threatened don't ever hand and all kind of thing he's done everything you know trying their best to to trap him in this and trap him in his words and he goes to Transfiguration and God says now this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell well look what he does he adds to it says here you him in other words he says now he's not my quote brother branham he said that sometimes the father spoke sometimes Jesus spoke now if that's hard to understand remember the father's the Holy Ghost himself remember Jesus is the flesh to just give you a little example to line that up with it you know and then you're not what does that mean isn't it means it's what it was sometimes the father spike sometimes the human element of Christ our Jesus himself would speak you all right in doing that see then you come down through the Ministry of the Lord Jesus as I said and you see how it works out within when he come to Mount of Transfiguration and said here you him it looks like our thoughts you know what he's done this and he's done that he's done this and he's done that he's went through this horrible thing now it's going to be a great glorious thing no the most horrible time of the life of the Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ was the life six months veteran said a very short ministry he said somewhere around he didn't see give us that number but it it would you know we're just saying through here and six over here if you take what make numbers what you want to in matter if it's two days it's two days still the point is they're the most horrible time and thoughts was there looks like it ought to be different it's not but a random he came into existence that brought the message started out back there had his River Jordan he had his time that God came down and witnessed and was saying this is my son your ministry will cover the world you'll go do this you'll lose and you'll fall run the second coming of Elijah all right a great announcement looks like the world would have flocked to it and and run it sold great now we have somebody to carry us on you know we've got the Holy Ghost we got looks like the Pentecostals at least would have caught that but instead what did they do they turned against him and he spent all of those years at least he says 33 years coming to the statue of a perfect man and there he was look like he'd get better but not it got worse they turned him down where he would start off preaching to five hundred thousand two hundred thousand or something then the first thing you know it would drop down to where it is just a few alright but he was in his schooling training stature a perfect man growth development until he went to Arizona and brought the Prophet said God take you out adoption God taking you out on the backside of the desert in other words taking you out to yourself he took him out back there and he gave him the seals did that make him did it turn the religious world upside down it should have because that was the Word of God that was the greatest thing nobody had ever spoke we all wondered what did this mean what did that mean is kind of like my brother-in-law's of Baptist preacher and he believed that that thing was you know there in the beginning was that animal he said it's like King Kong you know you just see it a great big ol animal walking across the earth you know I said and deceiving everybody I said that don't that don't look like he's going to see nobody will see that was his way mankind had no idea what those symbols and things were see why the code it would take a prophet to bring it all right he would come on the scene he'd enter his ministry would climb and climb I'll repeat this in a minute but he would climb and climb in his ministry and then the seals would open and the world turned even more against him they literally put him out one to see you he said this will drive what they say this will drive thousands of my friends away from me and it did it put him out of the religious realm as far as popularities and things oh yeah they wanted him because they wanted to fishes and loaves that went with it they wanted him to come because where he would would you know draw big crowds to their meetings and things yeah they wanted him there like he said when he was the Prophet was out when Jesus was raising the dead healing the sick they won't him was that quick as he said being to say I and my father is one and did not the Prophet say when you begin to say I and my father is one and these other things he said they'll turn against you alright see and it got worse instead of getting the better and really becoming popular he got worse until just turned out and rejected by mankind well I believe that don't you cuz I can follow that line you know well right now if I could follow that line with the Lord Jesus come out to work I believe that would follow the life and line of brother Branham within I believe somewhere in there we can find ourselves and that's what I'm trying to get us to do why talking about what's going on now talking about what's been going on since the Prophet left the saying I didn't die when the Prophet left me when it come on into the 70s and the things like that I began to rejoice I preached to you here in 74 that we could pass the Year 2026 and not break the word I've always been upbeat going because it didn't get dis interesting to me it got very interesting to begin to see what was taking place and then we could see two hours following this happening you know all kind of things that that you can take right into the word but seeing them the day in the hour that we live for ourselves see then some words I'll end it up and then I'll try to run feist and then we'll pick her message see then we ended up by talking about one you received a new berth somewhere down through there maybe before you heard the prophet after you heard it that doesn't matter you receive the new birth and that new birth made you a child of God alright as I was trying to explain that the Jews were entitled to the adoption because it was their lineage and right but they rejected that and when they rejected it it turned to the Gentiles all right coming to the Gentiles we would then have to be adopted we had no religious rights no no parts to be doing we would have to be adopted into the family and that's your new birth that's Romans like 8:14 that you would come to to being heirs and joint heirs by new birth and we beware the Prophet would cover it like Paul covered it how that Paul would talk about the adoption and the baby being a baby it was born to baby it was born to child all right but he didn't have the the training and it would be given a tutor to to train you and grow you up through the statute of a perfect man all right then it would come to her that he could trust you and he could give you the Signet of authority we're not trying to go out and I ain't never tried so you just think what you want to you think well you've this morning you laid it down anything it what is it all you won't do about what you think about me I ain't never been one trying to go to the backside of the desert and get a message I got a message it's called William branham's prophets message I don't need a message the Prophet brought the message now it's delivered to you and I but it's got to be understood and there's where you talk about now you can place this if you want to exalt it do what you want to it is left for the sons and daughters of God to make this message manifest or make known that's what I've been trying to do for 50 years make known the trying to show it stood back darkness was talking want to go about it you've heard me tell it over and over to stand back there forty years ago and said the biggest portion of the people of this message going to die and go by the grain and in no way did I have any form of thoughts then are now asked that they were not Christians I'm talking about true born-again Christians in the message are going to die and go by the grave code they don't know what the message is these people running all down doing these thing well that ain't nothing I stood back there and told you another thing I said it'll come a time I said you think it's deceiving when the two souls to Lourdes and the virtues and all of the things come out back there in the 70s that's you think this is hard I said it's going to come a time when they'll use the message against you well look what they're doing now they're picking apart brother Browns message now they've attacked of doctrinal issues the message in picking it and picking it and what sickens mean it sickens me to realize and oh we come down through Baptist churches that women didn't cut their higher I'm talking about 50s and things right and see me being old enough 79 years old I will remember it and all to do it that and then coming in into the message and seeing the Prophet teaching those things about the woman's higher well what's the first thing happens when somebody backslides now if you hadn't paid attention to that wake up first thing happens it's like the man up north up dark that is his daddy or brother you know he stayed with him but then he slipped off first thing they've done women cut her hair well that's Bible that ain't something brother branham come up with this Bible why would that be the first thing shows what it is so it was a demon that was sitting back in there wantin to do that showed it was a demon and the preachers that wanted to do these things and they're getting all kind of things okay get off it but listen getting down to your life you've got to have an experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth brings you into the body of Christ adopts you into the body all right to be a son and daughter of God as a baby statue a perfect man adoptions etc brings you up through that pyramid did he come out to the basis of what then God can say to a group of people he said by the new birth when he gives it to you this is my believe this is my son in whom I'm pleased to dwell like I said it a minute ago now I mean it seriously I can if you can't say that that don't apply to you now listen if you can't say that God said there I'm pleased to dwell then he did not come in your put your patent you're getting your own things he didn't come in but if he was pleased to dwell then he came in sorry for that pertinent but it's true because that's as serious as can be if he didn't come in here he he knows he's not welcomed but if he did come into this body and give me the new birth then he was pleased to dwell he wanted to be there anais can't see that well then you tell me what you say let's just decrease it not everything go home no see but there's still a headstone it's got to come I've taught you for 40-something years and I still believe it more today and ever did then the toast seals was this headstone to the church because you show me something else to come I'm open floors open come show me something else to come the seventh seal is broke the Bible said it was the prophet said it was but yet we've got 98% of the people that's been the seal doesn't broke I agree with you they're not broke to them but that don't mean it can't be broke to somebody right and why can't we believe with that somebody that's all I'm saying why can't we believe the our that we're living why can't we accept it and say this is the greatest thing that's ever happened it's for us to come to the basis of believing who we are don't you see I believe those field has to be broke to this if not what's your head I'm asking you I've asked the question ever since I've been in the message of it she'll be what the head is I'll show you what the cornerstone is I knew that in the Baptist Church we could read build on the foundation apostle prophet Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone we could read that the bad news all right we see that saddle it was the word the word just in the sample to head we're building what they say and Paul turned around what'd he say he said if anybody comes and says anything contrary to what I've said let them be a curse all right come on church have you received the new birth are you interested in the statue of a perfect man of growth development to where it would be revealed in our made manifest in me and you within somewhere there's a head to all of this and that head is a revealing of God's Word and it's something had to slap that on you it's revealing of God's Word that's the opening of the seven seals because the seven seals occurs before now listen on my quoting brother branham the seven seals is a full plan of redemption that true that's the full plan of redemption where's anything else to come well brother now I won't say it because you think I saw it but it's brother branham's to come back free something there he can't preach nothing contrary to the Bible you can't do that I'm not going off on these I tell you like it is if he's here he's screaming and glory about it he can't bring something contrary to the Bible well I get in the Bible to find out what the Bible says see then those seals will cap off the individual for their part because each one of us have to have don't quote see the Prophet I'll find this in you remind you he said all born-again believer to have a Mount Carmel experience Mount Carmel when they father got Elijah did with Balaam and he said our Mount Carmel is coming out of them denominations oh when you get something over into the seals there and we think what we just getting understand about to seal I remember brother mode asking we heard a brother down at Athens years ago preaching know when he was preaching about him seals not for sealing or he had this and he had that he had Russia he had China and he had this coming down I had to the service you know I brought him up Wars you know most of you know to me he had this little ways he could get under your skin just to her and he walked out to her to the brother and he said no brother he said I don't think we won't ask you where's all them people come from it fights that battle he said I don't know well mo says if you read the book you would go to Brown's death on the for sale come on am i right and me wants to quote what I'm fixing the quote for C or D say he said R comes in Protestants and Catholics reason for seal Protestants and Catholics coming after the bride gathering around Israel coming after Evans coming out to the bride that's where you battle that it's not a physical battle you know what I'm talking about that away it starts with their spiritual condition and then winds up into a physical battle Elijah was fighting it out where they have right but one day he had a physical contact where they have him he whacked his head off huh now listen church get what I'm talking about to him we have our own personal experience that God speaks to us personally I believe in that you know what God only speaks to the Prophet come on well the word only comes to the Prophet come on how long it will stay here the Prophet said that the word comes to the spirit feel well I guess there's none of a spirit-filled except a profit according to that yeah well what are we doing here huh what are we sitting here for let's go home forget the whole thing no I'm just dumb enough to go stag with it all these years I'm just dumb enough to go on through with it dumb is the best way I can say about Who I am go that's where I'll consider myself not consider one time this message come to speak and tell of you and I did the prophets they said there'll be a word born bride listening yesterday where he said to be delivered most of you know this birth plan be delivered of an new birth from according to Malachi 4 we're to be delivered of a new bar from Malachi 4 Malachi fours the thunders that brain fourth the pyramid in the Hall of thing well we had what are we doing are we dying what you see it's got to be in it's got to be revealed it's got to be revealed to us not to just talk about it but to be revealed the probably doesn't want to go over that when you begin to say I and my father one and these other things he said the Shocker pull away well we won't shut pull away what start saying I'm my father's one what does it mean to say I and my father's one that means he said hear you him oh but that's only for brother Branham now show me where that's that he was the example sure he was the start he was that but not just for him it's far the bride of Jesus Christ when you begin to realize who you are what you doing here well I don't see nothing going on we think you don't realize who you are you don't listen to what I've been saying now back up just to her listen if you was listening to what I said the Lord Jesus had River Jordan he comes through the statue of a perfect man through those times he grew in grace and knowledge is that what the Bible say is why because that human element was a flash outside when he come to a place that he was taken up on Mount Transfiguration and said here you him he said fight you ain't gonna get none else from me you're gonna hear him all right he did not to prophet come exactly the same way he had the Ohio River he had all the years of stature per man he had the opening of the seven seals he went dark connected came by and preach to the bride well I where's our Park it's to stay simple where's our part get a new birth steady the Word of God growth development into the statue of a perfect lamb these things until it comes to the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God what the time to make known now here I am still quoting it what you make him known he'll make you known and concerned with it I'm not I'm not I'm I'm a human being I don't want to see nobody to leave the church everybody thinks I'm so hard time no I want to see this church overflooded to work they would be running out to the seams right I want to follow in the God but takes one thing about it I want to walk in that word and just rest in that word and follow it because I know that's the only hope I got is the opening of the word all right then what would it wind up being so we go through the adoptions and we come out to that basis to the bride's got to come to a place that she can say I and my father one come to the place that you can say and talk about it all right no I've got him in there but don't worry about it the Prophet said it would come to a time that it would not be him talking it'd be you talking he's not that according to what is it Matthew 13 or whatever it is through our leavenworth you know sailing to where it's not I that saith but you you it's left up to me and you left of somebody to become the word is that a hard thing to comprehend don't you simply become what God has wanted us to be that would become our husband to the basis that that we would be so much in love with him until we care less for these things of the world and we're still human but to come to the basis of saying I and my father one abroad and do you realize now watch what I'm getting at now okay here we go what start what has been my father what has been our thoughts from the beginning and this is number six message that we would not be dealing with what was back dark that's faith builders that's wonderful things but we've had that 50 years and we are not changed yet all right but not to go that away forward to try to find something out there that will get us to something but come right back to where we are and do what the Prophet said not behind and not forward but to realize what's taking place right now we could look out there and see the world and it falling apart we can see the people of this message in it falling apart just leaving my flocks of them churches and all right we can see that taking place but to see that means there's something happening that wasn't read down there or talking to you the other day to find that work brother branham said and it hit me I mean you can't turn a corner now Saint bill in the building you can't turn a corner cain't building a house or a bunch of houses or condominiums or tens or something you want to take a little ride down to 285 and look at that building a downer hunt what that's a hundred or something bays in one building now they've got the big battery place over the higher they said going to work two two five seven thousand and and all these houses just popping up everywhere why cuz they're gonna sell it to them people what the Prophet said look at all the building that's going on he said that's the sign of the end of all the time and my goodness if that's happening around here what's happening all over the world build and build and build and everything crash your profits per but listen you realize then I'm putting this on the basis of my own thoughts because that's where I'm on state approach it because there always have been somebody's got to realize who they are and what they're doing somebody's got to realize that somebody's got to come to the basis of saying we're here without having that I don't see it somebody's gonna have to make it manifest as I said this morning with what they without us they means there's somebody without us that means us they can't be made perfect and I hope you understood that perfect that's the same as Matthew 5:48 be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect alright because that word perfect means complete are finished we're not complete today we need to redemption to the body I believe brother Branham was us was a full manifested Son of God adopted positionally placed in the body of Christ don't you I do I always believed that after I hurt him but you know water he didn't make a change he's waiting on us oh no no no no okay then you tell me what you waiting on ain't making it the wrong way you are me all right so everything's waiting on me and you well I mean ain't nowhere you ain't got nothin ain't got nothin either more that's really us answer when we're gonna begin to say sister Trudy she is what 80 now 81 that's Trudy McGillicuddy you're not truly

things than anything could ever be thought of as to be a human being living in just an humble situation plow them you when I was seven years old living digging out dirt on the farm try to make a living got married made 40 when when nanny got married I made 42 dollars a week she sat down one day and talking to my dad in law and telling him what it was and how that we was living off of that we were paying on a car we was buying groceries we was paying rent and was paying for furniture he said you can't do it I guess that triggered him a little called he was always good to us he would help us in any way you know but listen church forty-two dollars a week you know what we lived you know what my wife made her and Nana's clothes you know what she made me jacket she sewed yeah the only thing that done she worked in the factory most of you know what she worked for about three months and our married life and she worked in a clothes factory and they they laid it all off and that's where she was young and they just laid her off well I thought praise God she ain't working no more you know I still wouldn't making much more probably might have been still making the 42 dollars a week but anyhow they started hiring back she's first one to call I said now that's a mess mooom Wade was on the way so I told her one day and I'm in it I'm serious I said okay honey I've got her won't

bless God I'm gonna work and get me some money where I can go out and spend it on this yeah you know what we left you know what we had a hard time but we lived and I wouldn't take anything for that bought our first old home neighbor though he was real good to us and everything he's trying his best to adopt wait matter of fact Wade's worth ten thousand dollars where you know it or not cause that guy offered $10,000 who let him adopt wait for his son you know and you know we lived there well he said I'll sell you the house back there Sam and he said you paying $35 for months rent I said I'll just sell it to $35 a month well I used to have that we kept in a long time we had a deed and he wrote on the back of that deed I I guess we still got it somewhere and he showed every payment we made in $35 a month well you know what that home you know what had he had four rooms of the path so you ain't old enough to know that language it had four rooms and a bathroom Johnny house sitting out in the woods my mother-in-law came out one time and she was humming the nanny and she said she gonna start out the door always kidded her she didn't like to be kidding about this kid I said hey this cash make sure you flush that thing for you come back we lived but we had a good time but then we started doing better got an opportunity to get better jobs we'll end up having to drive 7080 miles one way that was all right she stayed at home and I done you say are you telling us women to quit telling you what you and your husband agree on that's what I'm telling you what you and your husband agree Oh cuz they ain't gonna get in no no beer - trying to tell anybody what to do I won't tell you what you you agree on but you know what the point is one we might have live in we done we lived and then we begin to gain a little ground and become almost well-off enough to buy something eat I didn't know what a piece of chicken was until I got married I always thought it was wings or legs and things like that cuz we didn't eat them you've seen the movies and things where the old preacher goes home with a with a family you know the Sunday dinner and the kids are out in the yard and the priests were sitting there eating the chicken that was way we live but we lived I'm glad of it I enjoyed it didn't bother me and see I wouldn't change for nothing I wouldn't change it would make no difference because you have done all right Ben we heard of the message we heard of the message there in this late sixties 66 brother molt and I started riding to work together he started talking about God sending a prophet and we begin to accept that 67 somewhere in the 67 we left a Baptist Church when I started in this message been enjoying it ever since bad days hard days I heard a lot of heartaches in this message of a lot of people turning against me because of the way I believed and what I say it and what I stood for but still I don't have no problem and I have no hard feelings against any of what I put under the blood stays under the blood if you dig it out you got a problem that's the best I can say it about anything you live your life before people that let them be that sure I got plenty of problems you don't talk about problems we prop up all day on them but now listen can you say you've enjoyed yourself can you say right now that you're enjoying can you say right now that you're enjoying the fact that you're in this message and believing it and doing would you like to walk across the road and and be happy and joyous and do the other thing and become a good denominational person are you trying to sit and listen bro they'll beat you death well what about it Danny where we go have you ever thought about but we're gonna cover predestination it may take a couple of messages at essaouira brother branham we've all been messed up on predestination cause we had it made up we go oh I'm glad I fell off of that thing because if I hadn't of fell off I'd have had to have done it later down the road we had it all figured out predestination was this a way of predestination was that way and now in the message they got this predestinated these seeds and they run this seed and they run that seed and run backwards and forth all in predestination somebody asked me a question we might even cover predestined thanks cuz listen it's very simple to me very very simple the Bible says and the Prophet says those who he foreknew all right now we all got to go without forty those who he foreknew he did what he predestinated so how does he predestinate by his foreknowledge that goes back before the world Africa since what everybody wanted for knowledge down here but then go back before the world the Prophet said it goes all the way back the Bible said it I just read it to you I just read it the Bible said that were predestinated unto adoption and your prophet said there was never an age like this age because nobody's ever reached this age you thinking about glory and how great that I feel about the this builds me up inside the thing what God is reserved for this endtime people then it just tired my heart out to see us just going and casting that down and you just thinking there's garbage Ken but he predestinated us unto adoption you realize what that means you're predestinated to a place predetermined to be at that place now you see what I've been doing for 40 years trying to get you to realize we're yet you predestinated to be sitting right here tonight do you believe it do you believe that God before the world saw you would be sitting here if you don't you need to get your Bible and read it because dollars worth if there's anything of the future to be a fake builder it's a great part of relight and what taking place right now the Prophet said we're predestinated by foreknowledge he said not to the basis that God has picked out one it didn't pick out the other one you only read him he said but he predestinated us and he said there is no way that that cannot come to pass right you mean there's something the Word of God I can't come to pipes come on quote you big man this message said these things in the Bible that me and the Prophet talked about that will never come to pass well now let's see it's business but I'm there they believe it did away I don't believe he's talking to the Prophet they say worse things in the Bible that wouldn't go come to Pais why would he put it in the Bible yeah I call it stupidity maybe it shouldn't be said that's strong that's alright I just agree with one time if God said it it's gonna take place and you can do all you want to and you ain't gonna stop it but if you don't believe it you can hammer all you want to and you ain't going to them to it either is that simple predestination he said God don't predestinate the way we think he said the way we think he said we predestinate like put you at a pipe and just push you through the other end he said where would there be any overcoming or anything involved if it was that a way see God wants you to realize what you're doing when we get out of this world we could talk about what we sing what we've done wouldn't we solve this when we saw that you remember when we when you saw this right here in the Bible I'm thinking to be a glorious time to be able to just sit down and talk about it he did predestinate one to be saved and one to be lost no way he predestinated about foreknowledge go ahead and pull this one up for certain because you want it go to the number forward brothers and on the the screen and let's just get this one because this one it's the one that we we hang out together with cuz here's a Summerlin church age are the church age book every which way you want to go up 154 and he's talking about I before I close this subject I know there's a question in your minds you will wonder you will want to know if I believe in the doctor of pre-existence now listen to it I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of the pre-existence of souls any more than I believe in reincarnation our transmigration of souls now he said he didn't believe in well they you quoted all you want to you go how to come back to that one called here's why be careful here and see this it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it is the word our seed now he's got a little word and iris picked up a lot eternally all right let's think about predestination for a minute so it's not did he picked one and didn't pick the other he said by foreknowledge he knew who would accept him and who wouldn't is that simple that's a simple plan of redemption alright he knew who would be saved who what he knew that before the foundation of the world so then everything everybody ever NAT that matches I everything that ever happens in the world God by foreknowledge knew that would take place you agree that's a simple summation of foreknowledge then he knows everything there's nothing that could ever happen that he didn't already know it so we're not pulling anything over on him to try to fool with our little thoughts of predestination cuz that's where we'll come to well if it's that away what hope of I God you never heard that arguments he said what hope I got if it's already by foreknowledge but just remember what he done he predestinated buys foreknowledge he didn't make it take place he just knew it would simple logic of understanding that the Bible is the Word of God and then he predestinated everything by his foreknowledge right now he follow me thought number one everything everybody every move everything we do is all predestinated by God's foreknowledge if not thought away cuz you have him picking and choosing and that don't work all right he said well well now you just make the predestination like a bad bit from the thought all right we had some predestination Presbyterians had a predestination form all right and you know we could read that those who he foreknew you don't remember read that in the Bible those that he foreknew he did predestinate well what that means those that he knew see you're getting the wrong way to go with it he knew what you and I would want that's why the thing formed can't say why did you form me this way because he didn't form us out a way my brother is the Methodist preacher and he said God can't condemn me for for living in sin code he made me a sinner I said wait just a minute he didn't make you a sinner he made you with an equal choice and he's 12 years in college and he made you an equal choice and you chose which one to go so he can't blame him for the choice you made right because you made your choice okay all right now so then if that be true now if you follow me that away and I ain't asking you to bow down oh I believe that brother Dale I'm just asking you to be sensible does that sound okay that God predestinate spies foreknowledge now let's go to the next Dale all right the Prophet said it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God see ever person country that's never before knowledge right every human being every movement everything that every time it bad it's high everything come about God's foreknowledge right but it's not the person that comes pre-designated eternally it's the word our seed all right now right here at hold on just a second irregardless of what you think about predestination there's got to be somebody to make live the word truth simple simple terminology simple logic there's got to be somebody to make it live there's got to be somebody for it to live in all right so then God by his foreknowledge knew that Martin Luther would be on the earth and what he would do and all the things that would go in life by his foreknowledge but at the same time it's foreknowledge they knew what he knew his foreknowledge showed they'd be a seed the seed was the just shall live by faith come on who at Martin Luther God said God said it there's a seed predestination predestinated eternally so Luther's message was eternally predestinated which meant it was going to come to pies all Luther got was a prop was the opportunity for it to live within him cuz that's all I'm bragging about anything it's what God does you realize all I'm making out of you and me or anything anything on predestination you come to we're going to come to one place that God did choose you because he knew you would accept it there's his foreknowledge so Martin Luther not Martin Luther now that's predestinated by foreknowledge he knew everything he'd ever do and what dude wouldn't do Martin Luther what about him being a great man like he was and picking this to the church age messenger huh and you know what he said he said him Jews when we took on kill I don't sound too good for a man of God but you know what that wasn't predestination eternally that was the foreknowledge of God that knew what Luther would do huh so what they're in that 1500 when it was time bracket they came a time back up 1 2 sermons a time not far right not a town far Luther to come on the scene a town - Luther to come on the scene not far because it just puts it in the wrong category coming back to that message it's the time to all things so when that word struck the earth by God's foreknowledge there was a man there that would receive that word and go forth and preach the just shall live by faith didn't matter if it cost him his life cost him everything that's not just for knowledge the man and his message become one well hope you can follow the man and his message became one and he walked out to her and he said I don't understand it I've read this preached on it had commentaries wrote on it and everything else here what it is and was it wrong when to defeat which one predestinate you know Martin Luther coming out her other just shall live by faith and he wrote they say write on the side of alone I got that wrote in my Bible he predestinated my has foreknowledge but a man had to be there for it to live in the seed had to have a place to land right and see what it did that right there now listen to what I'm saying predestinated unto adoption darzee new birth represented in Martin Luther ours you predestinated them to adoption it started right there started wailing back but I'm just finalizing it where you'll understand so in the days of Martin Luther that new birth that he received was the message of the just shall live by faith there's he seed the message the man become one with a message when he first started out he probably would just you know I don't like this hour cuz this cording to his records from time Martin Luther was not wanting to leave according to his brother his ones one book on he didn't want to leave the Catholic Church he wanted to convert to Catholic Church that's why I wind up in revelation he wanted to convert to church but then when he seen he couldn't convert it he just spent his theses and said here it is the just shall live by faith alone or only whatever you wanna put it so that was a predestinated unto adoption for Martin Luther just a new birth and remember what I said when I started don't get confused about it one two three adoption all because remember he had to be doctored in the family Luther was adopted into the family by the new birth you was adopted into the family by the new birth alright so keep it in the right order alright see there no long come a man named John Wesley the world had got so messed up under Luther's teaching but not under Luther I remember a brother at my house he was talking about something and I pointed my finger down on what brother Branham said I said would you mind reading what brother Branham say it he looked down and he said I ain't reading that that's come on you talk about reading the message you talk about read it brother Dale read what that says right there he said I ain't gonna do it you know what said brother Brent said to Lutheran's denominated and died they do you need that quote he wouldn't dare Hannah laughs see what Luther's that denominated they denominated his message the Lutheran denominated and died I have no problem reading what the Prophet said what you see he was trapped he didn't go to open his mouth cuz you know I'm sorry I'm just that independent but I meant for him to say something just like that feller told me one time he said first Corinthians 13 there what it is about the gifts and all he said nor just take that out of the Bible I said him in your Bible I'm serious I send me a Bible he's ain't getting my Bible I said hey you know better and hand it to me you know what I'd have done out of toward 13 out of it then either went and bought him a new Bible I would be no problem but he knew better to hand me that Bible code he knew I was gonna tear it up cuz you see that's not right Martin Luther brought a message those people are beyond the curtain of time waiting on you and me whatever you believe about all these others whatever just remember the New Testament and it is waiting but when John Wesley came on the scene he saw the world in such a horrible situation till he started preaching sanctification alright sanctification started dealing with the individual to bring an individual to the place of cleansing us setting us aside getting ready to bring forth in this John Wesley's he began to teach that he said lo that I came to America to convert the heathen said come find out I needed to be converted myself so he saw the message thing John Wesley was predestinated eternally from God not John Wesley the man the message didn't even brought but you had to be a man for the masses to dwell in that way you're not doing away with this and try to put this over here put it right they had to be a Lord Jesus Christ to walk upon the earth to be God manifested in human flesh right I'm John Wesley begin to bring the message he was predestinated to a position Luther was predestinated to justification Wesley was predestinated to sanctification what do you mean predestinated eternally not in sales not the human body those had to be there but the message was predestinated that seed struck the earth of the just shall live by faith turn the world upside down John Wesley come forward with a message Azusa Street came forth with a message of the gifts the Prophet would call it and the baptism of the holy ghost your prophet said just like on the day of Pentecost see if people don't believe that so how are you gonna deal with predestination then forget it if you can't see that that the Holy Ghost was the same Holy Ghost on the Susur Street as it was in the book of Acts then what hold ago see that have you got a Holy Ghost here to another differ Holy Ghost I'll well where's the Holy Ghost of that no see the word struck and that begin a situation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when your prophet came on the scene there in the thirties in time he started preaching the baptism with the Holy Ghost the gifts the restoration of all things he began to preach about Malachi 4 they began to talk about them things of how the word was to be restored it started than an adoption statue a perfect man begin to be taught are predestinated what was the Zeus the street come on folks I've had him right here in this pulpit and I don't approach the man before then told him he's wrong the man stood in this booklet right here and said it the Pentecostals was wrong it says false I done told him that wouldn't ride that didn't change him did you see oh he's got a big nine yeah he was the one that said he couldn't preach error so you go do what you want to you don't know who I'm talking about I'm just being serious you realize on the zoo the street that was the most glorious situation that ever happened you realize brother Branham right after Azusa Street made this statement he said they were closer to the coming of the Lord than we are do you need to quote I know there's one head and one head it goes with it that'll agree with it we can find that quote for you because it was God moving among the people living in the people and the gifts and signs and wonders not just gifts the signs and wonders and then the word begin to come forth the prophet coming forward bringing his message and as he began to bring his message they begin to develop on through into the statue of perfume and into the tea and then on into the opening of the word now if you follow what I'm saying so I'll make it five now cause 22 for and we'll quit you realize what I'm talking about if there's any questions you've been glad try to answer them predestinated unto adoption not predestinated under for knowledge poor knowledge is not adoption predestinated unto adoption to word that it would come the baptism of the holy ghost statue of a perfect man come out the opening of the seven seals somebody's predestinated to that place you understand what it says in the Ephesians that we've read said he predestinated us unto unto means travel from here to there unto those drums means I've got to make a journey to the drums onto in this day God is expecting the people because he's already brought us the word we already have the seed what do we need worse than that brother it's Britain's message which is the Bible that's the eternal part and that means somebody is going to be here somebody is going to make this message live it might be if I tried to preach that brother branham coming off of out there and when he come off will not die preaching and getting those still it was just a short time brother Brennan was off the scene because that would have been sixty three three years or so or less he preached the seals and he done left to sing the Lord Jesus are done I'm trying to get you to see it I ain't trying to make no fiery bed of these now make no badshah stroke story but both of those examples wound up costing those two men in their lives you realize what we believe what I'm saying here that I saw this 40 years ago that if I preach it and get it to the right place somebody's gonna die for what they believe you may not be me but if I die don't write on my tombstone he died as a failure don't write on there he with all people oh yeah I'm a human I get down-and-out oh yeah I get to myself and I cried I weep but somewhere somebody is going to catch the message right and it's going to be made manifest and it will be the seed because the seed is what comes predestinated eternally not the person but there's got to be a person for it to live in come on they had to be a Martin Luther Jim Jones couldn't handle it Samuel Dale couldn't handle it neither could you we couldn't handle Luther's message he was a special pick man because God could look down through and see exactly what it would take what did brother Ron say about Abraham he said God knew that Abraham would teach his family right he had his confidence in a man he knew would teach his family why because it's for dolly he looked down this reason what it already done but is God out there waiting on me and you come on I'm ending it with this part come on musician if God out there waiting only in you he's got back that way to go menu God's here your prophet said it one day he said I'm not saying he's coming I'm saying he's here we know we gonna begin to say that he's here let's believe it because the ain't you've got to be sometime right but around said I'll have to back up right he's because he's certain things gonna take place you know you know the quote he said I've got to back up wait on this out here well you know what I think 50 years later most of that he was looking for must be here uh-oh kind of thinking that called what else was he looking for what else could you have you realize how close we live to death second that's not trying to scare nobody it's truth but do you realize true how wonderful it is to know God has taught enough of us to tell us what's going on to send a prophet that he could preach the word until you and me what's taking place and see the hour and the time that we're living predestinated now listen to what i'm saying i'm trying to get a wording to finish it predestinated unto adoption it's not back there we destinated unto adoption is not out there Romans 8:23 to wit to understand right now to understand right now what's going on yea I'm innocent brother tell you this yeah I tried my best to get you to see it it costs brother it costs the Lord Jesus his life to be adopted it costs brother branham his life to be adopted now when we think we're going out of here on a flower bed of ease but do you think I'm scared No I'm happy I'm glad we're here because it's going to take place let's tell him thank on these things Church predestinated unto adoption meaning a place to come to that has now listening I'm finishing with this so you're taking this request this age has never happened before don't you go back to the book of Acts I'll go with you and I'll tell you some stories in the book of Acts they had some problems in the book of Acts Paul had trouble in the book of Acts the Corinthians is laying right in with the
