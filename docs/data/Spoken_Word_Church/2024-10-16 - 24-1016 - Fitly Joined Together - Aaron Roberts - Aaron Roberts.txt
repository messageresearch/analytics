questions Lord you just give us what we have need of in in in the right time and we just commit ourselves to you and we thank you for it in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen Ephesians chapter 4:1 says and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the in of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and kindy craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up and to him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love amen God bless you may be seated tonight and uh I just want take a little thought tonight fitly joined together and uh this the scripture here says from the from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted and you know the if you look this up it's it's the fitly joined together means uh the proper complete way that something is is to be joined together and so we know how the how the body is is put in position and this is uh I just want to read this quote this is from uh what does it take to make a Christian Life brother brandom speaking here he says but in the word I find that God did not intend for the church to be governed by intellectual or by any Theology of man but the Holy Spirit was given to the church to govern and control the body of Christ and I think in doing that with that in mind and in God's program we will never be successfully no matter how good our intentions are until we get back into the center of God's program where the Holy Spirit and he says now realizing this is not a new thing to teach but he said we just want to approach this and he says but we still thinking that it is Holy Spirit controlled church and he was talking about how they had you know the intellectuals and different things come in but he said and when the Holy Spirit desires to do a thing and degrade something or lifts something up he said it causes petty jealousy among the people which proves they haven't got the Holy Spirit he said every man would want to be in his place place and that's when he was talking about that was the reason why they had denominations and things come in because people had got away from the word and not not being led by the Holy Spirit and so they became we started to see these denominations and then he was talking about he said then from there because of the denominations he said we had spiritual dictators telling people what to do he said spiritual dictators in the church to say thus and thus but he said the Holy Spirit has placed everyone into the body of Christ and he said we're we're helpless to maneuver without every member of our body we have to have my hands my arms my mouth my eyes everything that's in me has to operate to make my body function perfectly and then if God wanted his body the church to be governed by his Spirit there has to there has got to be some way or so programmed that we've got to enter into other than what we have already had and so I want to look at this tonight because you know understanding that you know it takes the whole body to work together and how everything has to function and you know everybody that's in the in the body of Christ you have a position you have a part and you know because there's there's no big eyes or little 's there's there's none of that but everybody's important in in the eyes of God and in the plan of God and in the body of Christ there you know because we all are one and you know you you see you know just simple small things that happen and but when you when these little things come up it it affects everybody yeah and you know nobody nobody's on an island and you know as as old saying is you know nobody jumps over the moon pulls themselves up by their boot straps you know I mean because you know we've all had to go through things but you know what it takes somebody leading us brother Brown was talking about there in leadership when he was talking about you know when we grow you know we have a mom and a dad that that brings us up that teaches us how to go and you know we we learn all the things that we're supposed to learn somebody has to teach you how to walk and you know brings you all the way through and does all these things for you then you get a teacher and they start to teach you all these things and you you start to grow and you start to learn but it takes somebody to lead you and showed you how to how to go that way and you can't you just don't do it all on your own because you know it'd be you know be amazing that we didn't have to have somebody but we all have to have somebody to lead us and help us along the way and we can't do it all by ourselves and see everybody has to work their part and brother said every piece in the church must work together and you must keep up your part of it so we see what time we're living in he said we may be closer than we think we are so everybody has their part and everybody's important and every body has to do what God has called you to do and so whatever the part is that you got to do you got to realize that you're important in the plan of God right you got to see that you're that you're an essential part of the function of of of the plan of God that the body of Christ has to function and you know many times people like well I you know I I don't feel like that I that I fit in anywhere and you know you know because the devil always try to tell you that you're insignificant and you're and you're not but you know what if you're a son or daughter of God then you've got a place in a position and you've got to see who you are and you've got because the the thing is I if if I if I say one thing tonight you got to realize that who you are because brother R said he said the weakest Christian the the smallest whoever it is you know if if you're in that position he said you can you can make all the devils in Hell shake you can put all of them on the run you can you can shake the foundation of hell just by your prayers just by your believing why because it's not who you are but it's what you have possession of because it's what you what through what you are an heir of then if You' become an heir of that then you know you don't have to worry about what what other things take place you just got to put your trust and confidence in God and realize who you are because because all of the all of the blessings that the Divine blessings that are given to the children you know it it you know there it's not one person over somebody else you know one per well some one person has this and some but you know when you start to look at people's lives you say well I wish I wish I was just like brother Bob you know brother Bob's got it all made and everything's so great and and then you know but sometimes you talk to brother Bob and and you find out you just like well brother Bob I'll be praying for you brother why because you know everybody looking on the outside you think everything's great but all of a sudden when brother Bob tells you it's like you know they share with you it's like well you know what brother Bob's got a lot of burdens too and sometimes it's like you know it's not it's not as rosy as everybody else and correct so sometimes you know we we don't realize it just like the little story about the about the man that had the cross had to carry the cross and you know he's talking to the Lord that he didn't like this cross he's like I don't like this cross it's just too heavy it's just too cumbersome you know I just don't like this and I I and the Lord said well come here I've got this room in here the the room full of crosses come in here and find you a different cross to carry just lay your cross down pick up another cross well he started going through there he picked up this one cross and he's I don't like this one and he went to the next cross and he's like well I don't like this one this one's too long this one's too heavy this got too many splinters you know just whatever whatever there's always some kind of issue with every every cross that he came along and then he was like well you know what he said I like this cross over here when over picked it up like I think I'll take this cross it and the Lord said well that's the cross you brought in and sometimes sometimes when we realize all of the things that people have been through you know sometimes because he said he wouldn't put any more upon you than you can bear and so when you go through those things you realize God has has put you in a place that that you are able to go through the things that God knows that you can overcome that you can that you can handle so that's the things that he gives you and you know so sometimes we we want to complain about things but sometimes we ought to give thanks for the things that we have we don't have the condition that we're in as Paul said in everything give thanks with everything that we have to be content where we are to realize where God has placed us see we see how all these things take place and you know uh um brother Brandon was speaking one time and he he was speaking and he was talking about Benjamin Franklin and you know he was talking about how Benjamin Franklin went out and you know he was flying the Kite you know he was a very scientific type man you know he wanted to he wanted to learn more about things that were going on and you know the as they were trying to learn about electricity and different things you know he went out there and he started flying that kite one day and you know he had he had a idea that you know that lightning was electricity and so you know he got out there and he flew that kite you know when he touched it that day that he went out there and was flying that cut and he touched that thing and he's like you know what he said he felt something he's like I felt it I got it because it was it was a um it answered the question it was a proof to him what he was looking for exactly was what came to him and so it was exactly what he was looking for as he was pursuing this and he he came across this and he and he got to that and then brother R said you know I um he said that Benjamin Franklin was able to tell us about electricity but he said it was Edison and the other ones you know they were actually able to harness that power to make it usable for where it's at today to where we stand today these are the things that we're looking at today and so he and brother random says in the in the fundamental Foundation of Faith you know he was talking about this and he says now if if you see if the natural laws of God which is electricity and things once handled which handed in the right capacity can do those things talking about lights and and different things that we have today he said how much more could the power of the Holy Ghost once passing through the human heart by faith what it could do he said now God has not promised El electricity only just might have set them free but look what the Holy Spirit has promised to the Believers today and then we look back and we see that God put electricity here for a certain thing and science is moving up into the field of science and bringing it out so when he's talking about science starting to bring these things out and he's talking about the Christian experience but brother R says but we as Christians we become too clogged up we just can't understand well we think about he said the doctor said I can't get well as long as you think that then you're not thinking God's thoughts he said you can't do it if you say well I'm going to do die the doctor said I was going to die he said all regards to the doctor that's the best of his knowledge but he said see that's not by the word by the word it says that we're going that we're healed he said because see he said because he promised me that whatever I ask the father and his name would be granted he said I believe that's truth yes so when I see this that I take it by what he said he said now if God could just clear that little Channel out and run that energy out to that place then something's going to happen he said the whole body is set together to operate and his life begins just as sure as it takes every member of my body to operate and give me life so does it take every member of the body of Christ to operate together to get it right he said some he said some said in the church teachers Apostles prophets the gifts of healing Miracles speaking with tongues interpretation and so forth he said all those things in this one great Mystic body of Jesus Christ moving on the earth and someday I believe I believe it's near the end right now so it's going to continue on because the things that were set in order will continue on until the coming of the Lord and so every everything that has said he said and tonight he said just like tonight at this light here speaking of the lights he was pointing out he said this light here and that light he said it has give that little sling across the road Over Yonder run the wire out there that's the material he said well now when the energy goes into that wire it'll produce just exactly like it was in here so when you see that when whatever the conditions were in the one place if you just continue it's the same conditions that have to to be met it'll do the exact same thing and so he speaking here how but he was talking about he said but see he said the plumbing might be all right he said but you see by the water but see it takes he the wiring has to be corrected he said if the body is correctly wired up and the Father in Heaven turns the big master switch on something's going to rise up that's right that if it's the the body is if the building is properly wired and if it's properly taught in every fiber of our body being Lost In Christ and to his word alone see he said but he said but if you've got some theology or some Doctrine or some Superstition he said you get some unbelief he said it's going to stop right there right it'll go to right there he said but you've got it'll stop it he said then that energy will never pull through you but when you got to a place where you're perfectly wired and the master electrician has okayed it by selling it with the Holy Spirit the only thing is just turn on the switch then and there will be a light show and that's right so we see how when when these things have to take place then every everybody has their position and everything works in its right order then then God has called us all to our right place but he says if the body you know you've got to be connected in the right way and uh and knowing where you've got to be and what your position is that you can that you can have the same power it's the same power that'll flow through you and you say why why is it that uh you I was I was looking at one time you know talking about the women that you know cause revivals and you know there there's a little you know that little woman that was at the well and she was talking to Jesus and you know here she was you know she couldn't come when when the rest of them came you know she was a ill ill famed woman nobody want to have anything to do with her but you know what she came and met the master she had a she had an appointed time to meet the master and when she met him and he began to deal with her situation then you know what she turned around and began to testify to the whole town and the whole town began to believe what she said because she come back and said look this is the man is this not the Messiah identifying exactly because it was because of what her experience was what she had been through she turned around and told all the rest of them and how many times have you know you read through history and you see the different ones where they talk about the different the different revivals that took place and what was it it was some little washwoman somewhere that was out praying over the over the community or whatever it was some woman in the church cleaning it and praying over the church and you know what and then it began to break out a re in a Revival and you know it was some kind of simple simple thing that took place but not realizing but you know what it was the desire of a of a sister's heart that that she was Desiring a re a Revival to take place and you know what she began to seek that and you know what because through her prayers and nobody else maybe nobody else knew what she was praying nobody else knew what was going on but you know what God saw the desire of that sister's heart that woman's heart and and and it's like well nobody else knew but you know what she knew and you know she had Faith to believe and she be all of a sudden all of a sudden the whole Community changed all of a sudden the church is on fire why because it just takes one person one to to most it would be well that's some insignificant person but you know what it wasn't insignificant to God and say what was it that that person we like well you know you know they're just just just some sister just some maybe some young person but you know what they were tied into the right path power righten they they had they had anchored into that source and all they had to do was wait for the wait for that switch to be turned and it's the same way we say well we don't you know we wonder why things don't happen the way they do well you know we're waiting on somebody else well no maybe the reason why things don't change in your situation is because you're not the one that's right well maybe maybe maybe the reason why our church doesn't change is because of me right you know because if if we if we look at it as as a whole body then you know I realize you know what the buck stops here right we find we find many people that you know they they're out looking to see what everybody else is doing and looking to see what's going on and I realize you know sometimes you got to take an inventory of your own self to know what's going on and and and be more worried about your own self and what's going on you I was I was listening to a man the other day and he was talking about paying tithes and and you know people wanting to help the poor and and different things like that and he was talking about well you know you can help the poor you can help the widows because that's all scriptural but he said you know what that's not paying tithes and he said and he said because there is a law of God that has to do with paying ties and he said when you don't follow what the scripture says about paying ties you can't expect the blessing that comes with that because there's a divine order that sits in there you have to follow that but you see these people and and brother John this this would be good for you uh you put this in your notes but but what uh he was talking about you know some people you know they'll they'll blow through money you know they're loose with their own money but he said when it comes to the house of God you know they they are some people are so nosy about how how the church spends money you know when you know well we get we're getting we're getting new carpet and and the pastor's driving a new car and and this and that and the other and it's like like listen you know when you when you pay your tithes I'm not I'm not paying tithes to Spoken Word Church I'm not paying ties to brother Dale to brother Wade I'm not paying ties to him I'm paying ties to God that's right when I pay my ties you know what I'm paying my ti into God into the storehouse and then God because what I've done is oper ated the gift the law of God and then you know what it activates the gift in my life to be blessed Then I then I just put that I just put that in the hands of God because why are we so worried about people you know how people in the church spend money or whatever how all this but you know it's like well you know they ain't got two nickel to rub together but they want to know how the church is spending money tell it brother and it's like well you know what if you if you were and and I'm not talking about anybody here but I'm I'm just saying but the way this brother was bringing out it was so good he's like you know he said because if you were more concerned about your own finances about your own personal finances are you about the church spending money said you'd be better off right and so you see how these people they get all wrapped up in things and not realizing that you know if if you God gives you because you see people that they don't make a lot of money they make less money than other people and they got more money than people that's makes a lot of money why because people that have never learned how to save money how to how to be a because what the scripture tells you how to how to be a wise Steward of the money and what God has given you how to be a steward to that money as brother John's been telling us for all these times yes but see people people want want a blessing well you know they want to reach that Financial Jubilee brother John they want to get to that place but you know what they don't follow the law that's set in order to get to that place you know and so if you don't follow that then how are you supposed to be blessed and and so there's there's many things in in just the same way that everything in your life there is a there is a plan there's a purpose in God on how to do things and when people don't follow it they wonder why they don't ever get anywhere right you've got to follow the plan of God if you if you will just do because you know it's like well you know you see people in it and it's like you know you see brother Ryan and you know you know and you you look at brother Ryan and everybody's like well you know I wish I was like brother Ryan you know brother Ryan's got it made he's got you know and it's like well you know no people but when when brother Ryan gets up here and he does Sunday school he's very open about his about his Christian walk his Christian experience but you know there's a lots of times that you know he spends a lot of time praying he spends a lot of time reading you know he spends a lot of time with the Lord and everybody was like well you know if you don't if you don't ever put the time in don't expect to get anything out of it because you've not put the time in if you don't invest nothing don't expect a return you know it's like you know I I tell Adam all the time Adam Adam wants to be Adam wants to be a college football player you know that's his whole you know one of his goals in life you know he just loves football he eats sleeps and breathes football yeah but you know what I tell him it's like listen if if you going to be if you going to be I show them like these little videos of these players that's people you got to compete against 14y old kids and I mean they're muscular a whole lot bigger than him like that's kids you got to compete against I said you you've got but you've got to put in but I tell him listen if you want to be at this level if you want to be at the division one level I said then you got to be division one in everything that you do I said I said if you're going to be division one you need to be a D1 in the classroom you need to be one on the practice field you need to be one in the in the weight room whatever you do if you don't have that mentality that you're going to be the very best that you can be you'll never get anywhere right because you know what somebody somebody that's slower than you but they'll out hustle you right you look at you look at some of the greatest football players that's ever played Walter Payton was one of the best but you know he never was the fastest he never was the biggest but there's one thing about it you wasn't going to stop him I mean here's here's a man what he had a he because the heart that he had the drive that he had was so much bigger than any than anybody on the field and so if you don't have that desire if you don't have that drive if you don't have that Zeal then you know what you're not going to get anywhere because many times the Devil comes along and what does he do he starts to put hindrances in your way right amen you get these little hindrances these little things that come up in your life and you wonder well I I don't know what you know what's going to take place or well I don't know it's like well well tonight I I guess I'm just going to I'm just going to skip praying I'm just not going to read as much I'm just not going to do this no right on and it's like well you know I I just want to cut my prayer time short but you know sometimes sometimes the problem is is we don't press in you know you think about the message recognizing your day and his message when Brother band was there and he said I felt like the Holy Spirit was trying to tell me something want to speak to me and he said everything that he done was a hindrance he said the food that he ate didn't agree with him it was so hot you he was he went down in the basement he's trying to read he was trying to pre he fallen asleep just all these Myriad things just kept coming but you know what he just didn't say well Lord I I I'll just wait till tomorrow some other day but you know he said I kept pressing in I kept pressing in I kept pressing in and he said he kept going on and he said you know early in the morning he said the Lord come and spoke to him and he said he gave me this message and so see many times when people are looking for an answer well they don't they don't you know it's like you know I was talking to somebody one time we talking about the Sweet Hour of Prayer I like you know that's unheard of nowadays it's like sweet minute of prayer sweet minute of prayer yes but you know there there were times when you know people prayed all night long and people people don't know know what what that is but you they wonder why you say why why are we don't live a Victorious Life why don't we have an overcoming life why because you've not put the time in because if you if you've not laid before the and laid in the Altar and laid before God until you got your answer just like Jacob stand there telling telling when the Lord come to him he said listen he said he said I got to go he said nope he said I'm going to hold on to you and he said until you bless me he didn't give up he held on till he got his Blessing and it's the same way with you and I we've got to hold on and continue to press in because you know if you if you do your part and it's a challenge to each one of us because you know each one of us has to do our part right you know years ago I when I was in high school I took a carpentry class and we used to we used to no if you take I get in a lot of the trade classes nowadays if you do everything you know it's you go in and you and you you build a birdhouse and you build these little things we didn't do none of that when we when we done construction We Done Construction I mean we took we took two by 10 and two by 12s and we nailed them all together we'd have we'd have Flor Joyce you know three 2 x 12 nailed together or two three uh three or four you 2 by eights nailed together you know and we'd have to go set them things and we'd go to somebody Building a garage or building an addition or whatever and we don't put them things in place and it was just a bunch of boys putting them things in place well we had a they had a guy and he you know he liked to talk I mean he was strong but you know he was just standing around watching everybody else he liked to talk and not pay attention to what was going on and he just standing there and we got this got this big floor joy he got his armor right around and he ain't paying no more attention than the Man in the Moon and he's standing around talking everybody's trying to move his thing around he just right one day got ready to lift the thing up they picked him up off the ground you know why because he wasn't paying attention all of a sudden he got took up off his feet one because he just had his arm wrapped around it yeah and it's like instead of being there and keeping up with and not seeing what's going on and trying to be an asset and trying to be a help he just added more weight to the job and then when he realized oh you know what I'm standing here getting picked up off the ground and then the carry teacher got on to him because you know he's like well you know what you're one of the strong one of the biggest guys out here so why are we picking you up why aren't you doing your part and sometimes that's what happens us we get led to sleep and not realize you know we're not doing our part we're not trying to be an asset to the kingdom of God we're not doing what we could be doing because you know what we just flowed along and and somebody else is carrying us come on right come on now I'm not and I'm not saying eight times you know it's nice to be carried and sometimes you need a little help but you know sometimes we don't realize you know it's it's us that needs to be doing something not just the same ones over and over and over correct well it's like well you know we'll just we'll just wait on brother Luis brother Luis will get up here and he'll preach us happy and then you know he'll get up here and he'll sing us happy or whatever it's like well you know what it ain't all brother Louise and you know what and if brother Lise gets up here and sings and wants you to clap your hands or raise your hands or whatever and you know and it's [Music] so I'm I'm just going to preach tonight whether y'all like it or not I'm sorry but you know what what the the problem is is when they say clap your hands and you're like this raise your hands well you know what you don't get you know it's like well how do you what did you put into the service to get anything out of the service yes but you know it's like it's like and and I'm I'm gonna tell you I'm G to tell you my My Philosophy because some of the brothers have asked and I and I was glad to share but you know what I'm not going to get up here and Le when I lead singing I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands I'm not going to ask you to clap your hands I'm not going to ask you to do anything because you know what I expect you to do that on your own I'm sorry that's just me because you know what I'm going to enter in and I'm going to enjoy myself because you know when I get up here cuz everybody says when you lead singing you know they enjoy it well you know what I'm enjoying myself whether y'all enjoy it or not I'm not singing for y'all and y'all shouldn't be singing for me because you know what if the Lord's done something for you then you ought to be able to make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord for what God's done for you because you know what when sometimes when you raise your hands and you clap your hands and you got something to say and testify about something you know what it becomes contagious to somebody else that somebody else will be enjo that will be encouraged by what you've got to sake see we have we but we if we don't enter in then how you know it's it's not it doesn't help because you're like you know brother Wade's like say Amen say amen you know it's like you know you got to pull on everybody no you know what because you operate the gift so if you do the pulling then you know what we don't have to say can you do this can you do that can you say Amen whatever because you know what if it's something on the inside of you that touches you then you will respond to it you will respond to that because if it touches you then you'll have to respond to it see see if we understand the UN that we have the fellowship that we have that it brings all these things together in harmony with Jesus Christ we just and brother I'm talking about how it brings us into Fellowship see we understand who we are we come into Fellowship now brother Brown speaking here in influences he's talking about on the day of Pentecost he said when Jesus told them to wait there wait on the day of Pentecost you know they had to wait the time he said now remember Jesus said wait in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high they waited not eight days not nine days they waited 10 days until the promise was made manifest and the Holy Spirit fell and divided itself in tongues of fire set upon each of them he said while they were influenced by the Holy Ghost they went into action staggering like drunk men screaming and speaking in tongues out into the street they went they said these men are full of new wine he Peter stood up and said this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel and it'll come to pass in the last days what did it do it put him in action brother Bram says it'll put you into action if you haven't got it it'll put you into action when you see the word of God fulfilled he said when you've seen in these last days ought to put us into action it should do it if we if we would just do it with reverence and and humility see if you have received the exact same thing that they did and it and it brought them into a place where they staggered and act like drunk people and everybody thought they were out of you know they were out of their mind and was like wonder what's going on well you know what if you have the same thing and it's does it's done the same thing for you then you know what you ought to be able to raise your hands you ought to be able to praise the Lord and give thanks to God without having somebody tell you to do that because it'll put you into action that's right now you don't have to run the aisles unless you want to on and you know what I I would I would welcome that if you want to run the aisles run the aisles that's right you know everybody says well you know you know don't shout no higher than you than you can live you know well when you when you no matter how high you jump when you come down make sure you can walk a straight line well you know a lot of people get into this place where they live in where they live in in a world of condemnation well you know what I would I would shout because you know somebody will look at me and and and think well I I don't know why he's doing that you need to sit down but you know what we're all Sinners saved by grace and you know what and we're all we all have to be covered by the blood yes sir and if you ever get if you ever get to the place where you don't need the blood please come talk to me and test tell tell me about it cuz I want to know about it cuz you know what because there's lots of days I don't even feel like I'm saved Amen brother I work in maintenance no wonder I don't feel like I'm safe sometimes but you know there's lots of days that you come through and it's like you know you you realize I I I don't have you feel like I ain't got no Temperance I ain't got no patience you know it's like well the Lord put all these people in your life to teach you all these things because you don't need these things you know but so you you need them and you don't have them so this way it's going to make it help make it manifest in your life brother but you see all these things how these things take place well then you realize if if you just yield to that then all of then then you will he will lead you in that and you and you just because it'll make it manifest in your life that's right but but body well the well the Devil comes by and you're like well brother Ryan You' done such three years ago well you know what if he wants to talk about what you done three years ago and all the problems that you've had well you know what I ought to stand up and thank the Lord because you know what if he's delivered you from that and then you don't you don't have to worry about that anymore if it's if it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness then you know what you ought to just jump up and say well praise the Lord you know what because I don't have to deal with that anymore because it's it's not it's not accounted to me anymore because I'm free of that amen and it's like well you know you you know you you done this and you done that you said this you know but you know there's a time you got to put all that behind you if you know if you done what you're supposed to do because if you go and and seek forgiveness you know you apologize to somebody go make it right and you and you um speak to the Lord you pray about it you seek forgiveness you know what when it goes under the blood then you know what it's done away with but you know what it but the place that he gets stuck is between our ears it gets stuck between our ears and it never goes any further so when it comes time to worship lots of times we worried about what happened in the past and we don't real you know we're free then if you're free then you ought worship you know just like when Abraham Lincoln signed the emancipation Proclamation and he signed and said listen he said all the slaves in these territories are free yes why because they were conquered because the Union Army which is the American government they conquered the Confederates and when they took over listen everything that's in this in this these territories becomes our property right and guess what when it becomes mine I can do what I want to with it and you can't say nothing about it because you're defeated so what did he do he told him said listen they're free and lots of people like well does that look really legal well he said take it to the court and find out but he said by that time he said all these people will be free because I well you better not do this Lincoln you better not do that but you know what he he said this is what's going to take place and when those people heard the word of President Lincoln when and he told him he said listen You'll Be Free and brother R talking about when they went out there and he said when all they had to do was look for the sun to come up they were out there looking and he said he said the strongest one climbed to the top of the mountain and they were at the top and they were looking for the sun to break when the sun started coming up that morning he said they began to yell back down the mountain we're free we're free all those people that were down in the valley and different parts up through that mountain you know what they couldn't see any of that light but you know what there was somebody that came and started to Proclaim to them listen you're free because we see the sun the sunlight is shining and now it is free now you can go free amen and so it's the same way today see as the word of God has begins to shine and and the light is being made known they see you can be free right because he whom the son has set free is free indeed that's right amen see if we can just believe that see if now brother BR this is from the the message the greatest battle ever fought he said and I thought and he's talking about the sun and the different different constellations and different things and he said I thought that great Heavenly Host like that he it keeps to make everything in order and didn't then he's he's speaking of the things in heaven he said' but what about the disorder of the Earthly host how when one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order he said we should continually strive to keep the order of the spirit everything has to be done in order see if you understand that that all of the things that's taking place then you just follow that because God has made you free then all you got to do is follow because the leading of the Lord is there to lead you to show you all the way through and see if you're led by the Holy Spirit then he was talking about how how every every believer in the body is in harmony because he said the Holy Spirit would just place every member of the body and he said this morning in such Harmony see if everything takes place if you're in harmony with the spirit and the spirit is leading you then you know what there's not going to be anybody out of cater because if you're being led by the spirit then you know what the spirit's not going to be ER in error because if you're being led by the spirit then each one of us being led by the spirit then guess what there's going to be Harmony and he said he said if if we could come to this place and realize we can come to the place of Harmony in the spirit he said what would be such a spontaneous healing of soul and body he said if we would just hold our positions see if if we just follow what God has for us then all these great things can take place because what would take place we would all be in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's right amen where Miracles take place and healings and all these different things that brother R was talking about sitting in Heavenly places the the believer's position in Christ if you follow all these things how all these things would take place see if we realize what God is leading us into this if we just follow that now this is I I want to read some of this tonight this is this is from Christ the mystery you know they they can they call this the word of the church but you know brother Brown said love one another another above everything love one another he said no matter what the devil tries to say he said now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way right see as he because when he whatever the Lord is doing he starts to bring things in he said but don't realize he said the Satan's not going to let it stay that way he's coming to attack that thing he's going to try to tear it apart he said he said he bring some in and shoot them and make somebody a Target some critic or unbeliever but he said you stay right loving and sweet and kind he said don't take sides with it he said pray for that man he'll be saved to or that woman whoever it is just pray for them and stick one with another and stay with your pastor because he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll leads you through because he's ordained of God to do that to do so and so he begins to talk about he said See the s he said the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's right he said don't Clan among among one or talk or make yourself clannish we are one he said I couldn't say left hand i'm M at you I'm going to take you away because you're not my right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I want want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another he continues on you know we've got takes on what we believe and he said how we ought to come here together how we got to come here together and sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out y under to get in to fellowship with your brothers he said if you don't don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you get to praying right because he's talking about we're we're living in the last days and so much more as we see the day approaching he said if a brother you think is wrong or a sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up because he said it'll affect him it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison stuff AIDS of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it'll run him run him from the Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of God it'll drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't do that just wax that much closer together he said talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you and I I tried to abbreviate some of that because I didn't want to read the whole thing but I did want to want to talk about that because you know if God's leading you then don't because you know that you realize Satan's going to attack that and you know every time you try to be drawn together that's Satan's job he's coming in to attack that thing but he said don't take sides with it you draw closer to one another your brothers and sisters you got to draw closer together and don't let any of these things hinder you these things because it can hinder the church and you got to you got to work together to bring all these things together so we we got to be loving and sweet and understand one another and all the conditions that things happen but you realize God wants us to draw closer because you know what you're my brother I can't be without you you're my sister I can't be without you because you're you're an important part of this church you're a part of the body of Christ and then you know you have you have your position I have M but you know I don't want to be without anybody and when when one person is weak then you know we're all weak when one person hurts we all hurt but you know what when one person gets when one person overcomes and it's overcoming for everybody am right see when you realize that what God has called you to and everybody has their position and God wants you to have your position what God has called you to do you know and you know brother Brandon was speaking here talking about each person has has a Ministry you know everybody in the body is like well I don't know what my Ministry is well you know you know maybe maybe maybe you make good food I don't know you know maybe maybe maybe give an encouraging word maybe you pray maybe you're here paying tithes maybe what but you know whatever it is you do your part whatever God has you to do and you know in in the message come follow me brother Brown was talking about um that brother Leo Mercer was talking to him one time and you know he was talking about brother Mam's Ministry and and the changing that was going to take place and he said you know you brother man he said you'll probably just line up hospitals and speak and and empty out all the beds and everything like that and brother R said well it didn't sound right although I believe brother bleo was trying to be sincere about it and he said he said but you know he said the Lord Jesus never done that he said he said there was one there was one in the hospital do you remember when he was down there the Bible the pool of Bethesda great multitudes of infinite people laid there crippled lame blind withered waiting for the angel now that was in a spiritual hospital where people waited on Divine Healing and here the Divine healer himself came in and healed one and walked out so you you couldn't expect a mortal man or a Ministry come forth would be any greater than that was see I couldn't agree with that but brother Ram talks about the spirit gives and he took a piece of paper and he began to write this down he said God will never change the ministry but he will change the man with the ministry that's what's got to be done and you know I I I wanted to bring that out tonight because you know when when people start talking about the the ministry and not not just not just the five-fold ministry but every part of the body you know because whatever God has called you to do he's going to equip you he's he's going he's going to make you able to do the job that you've been called to do right you know because when when you know people lots of times they they well I don't I can't do this and I can't do that but you know whatever God's called you to do he's the spirit of God will equip you to do that righten and many times people in their lives you see things happen and people have uh gifts talents and uh sometimes they don't know they don't know that they have that ability until they they get stuck in a position and and all of a sudden they find out they can do those things and U so sometimes you know those things happen in our lives where we we well I I can't do this I couldn't do that then all of a sudden when when it comes time you know it's like well Lord you'll just have to help me do this and all of a sudden the Lord comes and helps you and you realize that you can do certain things you can do more than you think you can but you many times speaking of the ministry you know I I just want to I just want to cover this tonight because you see people they take this scripture and you know brother brandom is speaking here of this of the ministry and you know then they they say well God will change the man with the ministry see they're trying to they're trying to put this off onto somebody else but you know everybody has their position in the body see because just like you have a position brother brandham had a position brother brandham was called to a a position that that he was a prophet and he was he was the seventh angel messenger he had a had a position he had a job to do what God called him to do but you know that didn't make him any greater didn't make didn't make him any greater than anybody else cuz he was a Son of God just like everybody else right now he had a hire office but it didn't change it didn't change who he was because many times people want to put him on this pedestal but see brother brandham he said he said listen he said if you love me call me brother he said he said I'm just your brother yeah he said he said how many times I'm I'm standing here I'm I'm just just a human I'm just a man but I'm representing one see he didn't want people putting putting all this on him he's wanting you to see Jesus Christ amen he couldn't done he couldn't have done any of this without Jesus Christ and so so when you see this how he's putting all this together see he said but he said but it would it would he will change the man with the ministry now lot lot of day lots of times today you you you find a number of people that that I have that I went online and people post this and you know they're they're trying to make somebody else in that position was like well I'm sorry I you know I I I appreciate everybody I love everybody but let me tell you what there's only one seventh angel messenger there's only one Malachi 4 and you know what because he he he brought a a man and he was a prophet and he he brought us the word and he broke the word to us amen because it was Jesus Christ through that man that spoke to us and you know what then he equipped a five-fold Ministry to continue the work that's right there's there there's not somebody there's not another one man ministry that's going to come and take over and and Lead everybody the next the next thing we've got we've got the Holy Ghost that's leading us amen through the word is the Holy Ghost and you know many people people have tried to tried to make different which which I'm sure y'all probably catching on to what what I'm what I'm driving at but you you you can't put somebody else in brother bram's position nobody has being called but brother brandham to that position and if brother brandham was called to that position and he fuled his fulfilled his position he fulfilled the word for his day then brother brandham continues on here he said that's what's got to be done he said I know what I've got to do now listen this what brother said what I got to but I can't I can't do it in the condition that I am now he said because I've got to something has got to happen within me that will take God to do it right see when the word came and brother BR realized he was he was the prophet and he understood his calling the commission that he was given but you know what it he had to go through he had to have growth there were things that he had to go through it changed him but you know what it didn't change who he was the position that he is but that God work done a work in his life to change him that he grew up into the position that God wanted him to be in so he could fulfill the word but you know never it never done away with who he was that's right and it's the same way because if if brother brandham came and he had to fulfill his place then you know what you and I have to fulfill our place amen that if that if if brother brandham came and he had to fulfill the word for his day with the position that he was in and he fulfilled that then he brought the word to us then you know what the word comes to you and I then he does the exact same thing to you and I right amen because if if you because if God called you to be an end time believer to carry this message and and and go to a body change then you know what then the word will equip you to do that and he said he said because I can't do it in brother said I can't do it in myself he said it's something that God will have to do well if he's if it's been promised to you then realizing I can't do it in myself but you know what I realize that God will have to do the work but you know what he's equipped us with the word to do that that if you will yield to the spirit then you know what it will take place just like brother brand when he came to the position he had to come to it will come to the same exact place see here in modern events made clear by prophecy see you can't there nobody nobody can take anybody else's place God called you to a specific place and he called you to a specific job then you know what You' got to find your place yes that's right and you know what and and be faithful to what God called you to do God's not God's not going to ask you what you know if you done this or not or that he wants to know are you faithful to the calling that you've been given right right are you Faithful in what God calls you to you know it's just like when when David was there on the back side of the desert you know he was out watching a few sheep but you know what he began to have fellowship with God he had he had a he had a revelation of who God was and he began to deal with with go with David and you know they had fellowship and all these things that took place well then all of a sudden when he went through these Hard Times these battles when the bear came in the lion came in you know he didn't just drop everything and run right why because he realized who he was and all of a sudden no no doubt the bear and the line was much bigger than he was but you know what he didn't give up right he went through and he and he overcame and he won and he slew both of them so when he come before Saul and he out there and he sees Goliath do you know what he wasn't afraid right amen why because he had an experience with God that he hadd been through something then when he went up there and told him said listen I'm not afraid of that philistin he saidwell he comes at me with a with a spear and a sword and all these things but he said I come in the name of the Lord he said because he realized you know when when he came out against to defy the armies of God he defied God right and then David realized hey you know what this is in the hands of God all I got to do is go walk out there right right all I have to do is have faith in God Amen that he's got that he's got the battle so when he went out out there he wasn't afraid he say oh this is this is the best y'all got y'all got this little Rinky Dink fell y'all sin out here y'all ain't got a real real Warrior he didn't he didn't realize he' met more than his match and he told him said listen he said this day I'm I'm GNA take your head off of you he knew exactly what he was what was going to take place because you know he real realiz that the victory had already come before the battle even started and so just the same way see we understand God has brought us to this place and we see that God is bringing us through God has already given us the victory so this is from Modern events made clear by prophecy he said notice now speaking of Jesus Christ he said no notice now he said they had done to him just exactly what the prophet said they would do just as they were doing they are doing to this the very same day in the leoan age he said if you want to look at it read Revelation Three Blind naked and don't know it turning Christ he said when he begins to reveal himself into the seed form again the same one that went into the ground come back to be the bride just the bride and the groom is the same flesh and blood the same Ministry and the same things doing just exactly what he done the spirit so we you see what took place in in the past is exactly what's taking place today if he overcame and the and the and the Word was fulfilled whatever he done then you know what it's being done exactly the same thing today the revelation of the word came in in his day and he began to open the scripture we had the same thing in our day the same one that came and spoke to them began to reveal who he was who they were what they were supposed to do what God had called them to do same thing happened today amen he's equipping you and showing you who you are that you can do the greater the Greater Works and you realize you do your part and everybody does their part then it all works together then he said when the when the bride recognizes who she is says she going to be Invincible be an invincible Army that's right see we all work together and everybody has to lean on each other let's all stand we'll have the musicians come if because you realize who you are Lord let me be faithful to what you've called me to be to do my part yes you know Jesus telling the the parable of the talents you know you know he gave the different ones the different servants the different stewards the different amounts of talents you know one had 10 one had five one had one but you know the ones that that had they put it to use and were able to make more but you know what the same commission was given to all three of them and one was like well Lord I just went and buried it I just had I just had one but you know what you never you never know what what he could accomplish if he never because he never put that one to use he's like well I I don't have whatever I don't have what the rest of them have but you know what they he never used that and it's like then then he was rebuked by the by the master by his Lord because he didn't do what he was supposed to the other one's done it and it's like well you know I I can't do because I don't have this and I don't have that be faithful what God calls you to do because that because God whatever he gives you whatever a little bit it is it's important if it's in the kingdom of God am amen God bless you tonight we sing a song The abides amen I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk the pilgrim away for the hand God all my life I see and the reason of my secret all is
