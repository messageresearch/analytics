[6:12] brother Shetty I thought he'd done a
[6:14] good job our forest Winston I really
[6:16] enjoyed it and then I prayed that that's
[6:20] the beginning of a seeing these brothers
[6:23] coming in from overseas I've always
[6:25] tried to tell you I believe if God is
[6:27] revealing himself here he's revealing
[6:29] himself around the world and I believe
[6:31] that so you know I look forward to that
[6:34] I meant to see all that good to see
[6:37] Robby back there with us all right
[6:39] you like turning into article with with
[6:41] us in John now where we're trying to
[6:43] back up to where we were a couple of
[6:48] services ago and try to pick up you know
[6:51] our thought and continue on you know
[6:55] John one in Genesis one the only father
[6:58] we thank you for the grace and love that
[7:00] you bestowed unto each and every one of
[7:02] us that you would allow us to be able to
[7:05] come together they would fellowship
[7:08] together around your word and that you'd
[7:11] reveal your word and to us and that
[7:12] you'd open the eyes of our understanding
[7:14] truly that we may see you because that's
[7:18] the purpose in order to serve you is all
[7:21] that we desire anything we ask you to
[7:23] help us and guide us and through what we
[7:26] would speak and what to say to your
[7:28] people you direct our thoughts we love
[7:30] you and we just commit everything to you
[7:32] vie with each and every one you said you
[7:34] sent your word and healed us and
[7:36] delivered us from destruction so we
[7:40] depend upon that and you just come
[7:41] forward and minister yourself unto us
[7:44] forgive our sins because we want to be
[7:47] covered by the blood of Jesus Christ and
[7:50] got us and keep us in Jesus name Amen
[7:52] okay John 1 we've been reading this for
[7:57] a while but that's alright it doesn't
[7:59] wear out does it so in the beginning was
[8:02] the word and the Word was with God and
[8:05] the Word was God the same was in the
[8:08] beginning with God all things were made
[8:11] by him and without him was not anything
[8:13] made that was made in him was life and
[8:18] the life was the light of men and the
[8:21] light shyness and darkness and the
[8:23] darkness comprehended it not now let's
[8:26] go to Genesis 1 a very familiar
[8:30] scripture with all of us to read to
[8:33] bring our thoughts when God said let us
[8:38] make man in our image after our likeness
[8:41] and let them have dominion over the fish
[8:43] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[8:46] and over the cattle and over all the
[8:48] earth and every creeping thing that
[8:51] creepeth upon the earth so God created
[8:54] man in his own image and the image of
[8:57] God created he him male and female
[9:00] created he them and God blessed them and
[9:05] God said unto them be fruitful
[9:08] and multiply and replenish the earth and
[9:11] subdue it how dominion over the fish of
[9:13] the sea and over the fowl of the air and
[9:15] over every living thing that moveth upon
[9:18] the earth the Lord said amen to his word
[9:21] today you may be seated and we've been
[9:30] for some time now this makes eight
[9:33] messages that we're trying to bring a
[9:37] thought and we're where our thought is
[9:39] to one thing is to keep in our
[9:42] understanding to the right place to
[9:44] where we can understand what God is
[9:48] trying to reveal to us all right now
[9:51] we're still back before the foundation
[9:54] of the world we haven't come down I
[9:56] would I told you I'll announce it when
[9:58] we start dealing we will deal with some
[10:01] things today this morning that will be
[10:05] relating to those things but we will
[10:08] announce when we come to earth with our
[10:10] thinking we're still up in heaven and
[10:13] what are we doing back in the mind of
[10:15] God that God before the foundation of
[10:18] the world if we're going to believe
[10:19] there is a God why would we not believe
[10:22] that His infinite wisdom would allow him
[10:26] before the world ever would begin for
[10:30] him to know everything that would ever
[10:33] take place upon the earth ever
[10:36] that'd bad it's I you know I mean that
[10:39] Sardi go out in the yard and they just
[10:40] all over your face and you just think
[10:42] that God knows every one of them because
[10:45] we didn't he wouldn't be infinite what
[10:47] season by doing that why would we not
[10:50] believe that he before the foundation of
[10:53] the world could know all things and have
[10:58] a will read it no minute have a plan and
[11:01] a purpose in doing what he's doing and
[11:04] that way to express himself that's his
[11:08] point all right then in doing that then
[11:11] to bring that to a position that you and
[11:14] I would understand what part we are and
[11:17] the part we're playing into the things
[11:21] of God
[11:21] now God in his mind then as I've told
[11:26] you over and over we've been through it
[11:28] God in his mind could set back before
[11:31] the world and see everything that would
[11:34] ever happen all right if not then you
[11:38] might well forget it I mean if you don't
[11:39] believe that kind of a God then go home
[11:42] because you're wasting time just go get
[11:45] drunk have you a good time do what
[11:47] you're going to do forget it because
[11:48] you're wasting God's time and yours too
[11:51] you say well you shouldn't talk that way
[11:53] well why not is it true I mean if you
[11:56] don't believe that God is real and not
[11:59] just a myth or a thought that we went
[12:02] through to try to bring just an idea or
[12:04] a concept of mankind a good thought you
[12:07] know or something like that and not
[12:10] believing how real he is then we might
[12:13] as well forget it because we're totally
[12:16] out of the any thoughts as I've always
[12:19] said to you anybody in the Bible that
[12:22] ever amounted to anything was a person
[12:25] that believed God's Word was speaking to
[12:30] them at that time showing it and being
[12:34] it and directing them for the time that
[12:37] he was doing that all right see than in
[12:40] that it's not nothing new pulled over on
[12:43] God you know well I'm gonna do this I'm
[12:47] gonna do that them because I'm gonna
[12:49] pull some over on him you go ahead you
[12:51] your your that dumb just go ahead and do
[12:53] it because you forget it
[12:55] but now thinking about it see that God
[12:58] in his mind that he would see everything
[13:05] are you going to limit him to where he
[13:09] can't do those things because remember
[13:11] not my point is this if we try to limit
[13:14] God do you know what we're doing now if
[13:18] we say God didn't know this or God
[13:20] doesn't know this or God can't do this
[13:22] or God can't do that if we're in
[13:24] limiting God in any way we're making
[13:27] ourselves greater than he is now that's
[13:31] as easy as I can make it to you
[13:34] if we in any way think we have anything
[13:36] to do with it
[13:37] I'll get back to it in a minute what was
[13:40] his plan and purpose to express himself
[13:46] to her we're part of the expression but
[13:49] remember it's expressing him and we'll
[13:52] get to that in a minute because I have a
[13:54] thought I was trying to get to it in the
[13:56] last message and you know we were
[13:58] dealing with the book of the life of the
[14:01] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[14:03] world and how that God before the world
[14:05] could write every name in the book of
[14:08] life I leave them out then he would have
[14:10] books that would cover other things
[14:13] which would be people's and you know and
[14:17] all like that and all written in the
[14:18] books but the main thing is to have to
[14:22] whether or not your name is in the
[14:24] Lamb's Book of Life section that is
[14:27] eternal the other is thoughts in his
[14:30] mind and people in that don't have
[14:33] eternal life
[14:34] that's the thing I want you to deal with
[14:37] today and you're thinking we'll get to
[14:39] it in a few minutes we're going to deal
[14:41] with two creations we're going to talk
[14:45] about two creations one of those is God
[14:52] and his offspring in his way he comes
[14:56] the other one is the natural world and
[14:59] things see then that way if you'll take
[15:03] it and listen so you won't come up with
[15:06] stumbling questions in the prophets
[15:09] message so you'll see that he'll say
[15:12] like Christ from history he said first
[15:14] thank God creators angels and they
[15:17] worshiped him all right but then go back
[15:20] into Christ and mystery of God revealed
[15:21] this a little bit in it and he'll come
[15:24] forth and he'll say it like this he'll
[15:26] say the first creation would light then
[15:33] he'll say he was his first creation well
[15:40] you know what he's exactly right in all
[15:43] three things he said
[15:47] if we get it in the right order now if
[15:50] we don't we've got it all bumfuzzled
[15:52] seen you read that's reading I say
[15:54] things like it because I know what the
[15:56] human mind does you read the message or
[15:59] you hear the Prophet say something and
[16:00] then you'll remember something else he
[16:02] said well I remember he said this over
[16:04] here I remember he said this over here I
[16:06] was telling brother Shetty you never
[16:11] wanted his points he was bringing out I
[16:12] don't remember what it was but one of
[16:14] his points he's bringing out he was
[16:16] bringing it out correctly but it was an
[16:19] offline quote to the point that he was
[16:22] quoting and it wasn't exactly the
[16:25] wording of brother Branham and people's
[16:28] birthday I didn't read the rest at
[16:31] Sean's oh I know he he missed the whole
[16:36] point that a person is trying to bring
[16:38] the whole thing because how smart you
[16:41] are to be able to comprehend you think
[16:46] I've got it right continue you know
[16:48] that's what it is you got to write the
[16:49] thing and that's what are you doing she
[16:51] said I think right and so that's messed
[16:54] it up so that's what's going to mess us
[16:55] all up what I think we don't have no
[16:59] rights we forfeit our rights by becoming
[17:02] Christians we accept Jesus Christ as our
[17:06] Savior and we don't have no more rights
[17:08] after them like I write this note no we
[17:11] don't because you forfeit your rights by
[17:13] accepting him or else you're not going
[17:16] to have eternal life
[17:17] all right now so we were talking about
[17:20] the book of life of the Lamb and I say
[17:23] it that way because see there is a
[17:25] technical point that you can do the book
[17:28] of life and then you can do the book of
[17:30] the life of the lamb slain all right the
[17:32] book of life can be Judas's name was
[17:35] written in the book of life and was
[17:36] taken out okay but Judas's name was not
[17:39] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[17:40] section of eternal life and then be
[17:44] removed that will not work all right so
[17:47] then you got it in the correct order to
[17:49] understand okay
[17:50] so then before the foundation of the
[17:52] world in God's mind he could see every
[17:57] person that would ever be in the world
[17:59] and everything that would ever happen
[18:01] and he could write our name in the
[18:04] Lamb's Book of Life section eternal or
[18:06] he could put our names in the book of
[18:08] life or he could leave our names out
[18:12] because it's his choice and his doings
[18:14] all right now see then that's the
[18:17] eternal thoughts of God remember what
[18:20] we've been trying to bring out God dwelt
[18:23] alone with his attributes when are they
[18:28] his thoughts his desires he dwelt alone
[18:33] he was self existing nobody would dwell
[18:35] with him and we didn't dwell with him
[18:37] get all that out of your mind would you
[18:41] but you sound like you believe in
[18:42] pre-existed I believe in pre existence
[18:44] of eternal life I do not believe in pre
[18:47] existence of people but we'll get to it
[18:51] in a minute where the Prophet said in
[18:52] church age book one they say he said
[18:55] it's not the person that comes
[18:56] predestinated eternally from God it's
[18:59] the word or seed all right so that
[19:03] solves the problem I have no problems
[19:07] with predestination one because the
[19:12] Bible says those he foreknew
[19:15] he did predestinate so foreknowledge
[19:18] comes first
[19:19] all right now if you go by foreknowledge
[19:22] then you have no trouble you know but
[19:24] that just don't give me that that don't
[19:26] let me feel like it that I feel like
[19:28] this is right over here I feel this good
[19:30] if you feel that's fine but what about
[19:35] the word what does the word say it's not
[19:40] what we feel is what the word says all
[19:43] right now so we went through that to
[19:46] bring out that God had written their
[19:49] names
[19:49] in the book of the life of the lamb
[19:51] slain or either he didn't write it
[19:56] seasoned that away it's left up to him
[19:59] to fulfill all that what he's going to
[20:02] do and remember by his foreknowledge he
[20:07] not only saw that you would accept
[20:09] eternal life and could write your name
[20:12] in the book of life of the Lamb
[20:15] or he could by seeing that you would not
[20:19] accept him as your Savior he could leave
[20:22] your name on so then for knowledge
[20:24] covers the whole thing at the same time
[20:27] don't misunderstand me because I'm
[20:30] making it so strong about his mind and
[20:34] the way I'm approaching it I'm afraid
[20:36] you're going to get the idea that I'm
[20:38] trying to drive too hard a point my
[20:41] point is what in his mind he saw who
[20:48] would accept him and he saw who wouldn't
[20:51] at the same time so that don't give
[20:56] something special about us
[20:58] we'll get the end of the message there
[21:00] is something special about us if we
[21:02] believe it right all right then we went
[21:06] through that okay then we went into word
[21:09] that we're talking about what took place
[21:10] before the foundation of the world the
[21:14] Bible said the book of the life of the
[21:16] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[21:19] world horn so we went back to see that
[21:21] this was in his mind and he done it
[21:23] before the foundation of the world or at
[21:25] the same time something was taking place
[21:31] job said where were you when the morning
[21:34] stars sang together the sons of God
[21:35] shouted for joy in the morning stars are
[21:42] the children of God the sons of God
[21:44] shouted for joy they're the sons and
[21:46] daughters of God but the angels were
[21:48] singing the first time they sang you
[21:50] remember the Prophet said they sang in
[21:52] heaven as a rejoicing and you think
[21:58] about it like I've said in God's mind
[22:03] see we want to limit that mind instead
[22:06] of it instead of looking at it and
[22:08] seeing how much that we're just
[22:10] gradually seeing the mind as it unfolds
[22:13] because of our ability to understand not
[22:17] because of what he's doing we're just
[22:19] figuring they're scratching the surface
[22:21] to understand his mind because easy to
[22:26] eternal God Joe
[22:28] said where were you when the morning
[22:30] stars sang together sons of God shouted
[22:31] for joy then guarded his mind before the
[22:37] foundation of the world at the same time
[22:44] you remember I gave you the quote for
[22:45] the prophecy could this be
[22:48] you needed my got him laying here be
[22:50] Leonard he said could this be where the
[22:52] Morningstar Sangha he said could it be
[22:54] when our names were written in the
[22:56] Lamb's Book of Life
[23:01] now you're getting to something more
[23:04] regal right you know not just talking
[23:10] about his mind you're getting to
[23:11] something more real to the fact that
[23:14] those sons and daughters of God could
[23:17] shout for joy and gave you where the
[23:19] Prophet said it he said when they seen
[23:21] the plan of redemption come into view
[23:28] why were they shouting for joy because
[23:31] they saw the plan because they saw I
[23:34] gave you the quote from the Prophet
[23:36] where it was they saw the Savior coming
[23:38] forth who's who it is they the sons and
[23:43] daughters of God they saw it what made
[23:53] the angels shout so well they shouted
[23:58] because the sons and daughters of God
[23:59] shouted know the Angels shouted because
[24:02] they knew they were going to have
[24:04] something to do with God's plan and
[24:06] purpose the Angels well that's what's
[24:11] your profit see the Angels would shout
[24:18] or see it right around will you shout
[24:22] one down another time you'll say cry in
[24:23] a relational board okay I do those
[24:27] things because something I get them
[24:29] smarter that's all so he said Jojo fix
[24:31] it well I try to put it towards it you
[24:34] won't argue the point in any way all
[24:36] right
[24:36] but think about it according to the
[24:41] Bible
[24:44] those angels are ministering spirits
[24:53] ministering spirits as Hebrews 1:13 but
[25:00] to which of the Angels said he at any
[25:02] time sit on my right hand until I make
[25:04] thine enemies thy footstool are they not
[25:08] all ministering spirits sent forth to
[25:13] minister for them who shall be heirs of
[25:17] salvation and angels have a job they
[25:24] were created for a purpose
[25:26] I got it laying in here to where the
[25:29] Prophet said only the redeemed of angels
[25:32] see we thank this and we thank all the
[25:35] little angels right here little angels
[25:36] of their questions and answers in 1964
[25:41] paragraph 53 p2 money only the redeemed
[25:47] of angels
[25:48] it isn't promised that sinners has
[25:50] angels it's only the redeemed of angels
[25:53] did you know that so the angels of the
[25:56] Lord and counseled about those that fear
[25:59] Him I love the way brother Branham
[26:01] speaks the Bible does not say angels of
[26:05] God the yet brother Branham winter
[26:10] relates it back to the Bible says the
[26:13] angel singer of God because it takes the
[26:19] holy spirit to cover all of those angels
[26:21] so only the redeemed of angels you mean
[26:25] we had angels brother instead we did
[26:28] they took care of us they got us the
[26:31] Bible says it in that those angels then
[26:33] why what knows angels sing' think about
[26:41] it in his mind there he is and he's
[26:42] talking and the sons and daughters of
[26:45] God are enjoying it and they says I'm
[26:48] gonna bring a plan and purpose into view
[26:56] and you're going to be part of that plan
[26:59] the purpose and said now the Angels have
[27:03] got their part in angels / kupets and
[27:06] what they're going to be ministering
[27:10] spirits to ministers to the Eyres of
[27:14] salvation and remember a love those on
[27:18] angels fail so they didn't hold their
[27:21] estate now don't you think that's going
[27:23] to be bad they're not going to get no
[27:25] rewards no we're down the road they're
[27:27] going to be annihilated with somebody
[27:30] yesterday waiting on going down to the
[27:32] hunting land a little bit you know the
[27:35] bible does say why does it set this way
[27:38] says you'll judge angel it don't say
[27:41] you'll judge people it does in the basis
[27:46] that it goes on to talking about you but
[27:48] it Langley says you'll judge angel
[27:52] remember those angels are the ones that
[27:54] supposed to be helping us so who you
[27:56] think's going to judge them you
[28:02] understand what I'm getting actually
[28:04] before the world something was taking
[28:05] place
[28:06] and if God was explaining what he was
[28:09] going to do the sons and daughters of
[28:14] God saw the plan of redemption come into
[28:16] view and as he did those angels saw it
[28:23] come into view - and they begin to
[28:25] rejoice about what they were going to be
[28:29] able to do so you're following that
[28:32] story of what we were trying to bring
[28:33] out so the morning stars and all like
[28:37] that or before the foundation of the
[28:39] world then we tap just a little bit
[28:41] right at the end of the message talking
[28:43] about the Genesis 1:26 and 27 28 there
[28:47] man
[28:49] and how that man was created I won't get
[28:53] to a word in a minute I want you to hold
[28:55] it but that man came into being as a
[29:01] child of God
[29:05] that man came into being before the
[29:09] world ever begun was not a creation
[29:17] that's why it says let us make man then
[29:23] it says when you get over to Genesis two
[29:25] and seven let us form man a lot of
[29:31] difference from creating form and a lot
[29:33] of the words that we use but we'll get
[29:35] to it and then it and think about it he
[29:37] then before the foundation of the world
[29:39] God you say well it was just in his mind
[29:42] just remember what he saw in his mind is
[29:45] taking place today I love the quote
[29:50] where brother Branham says he said he
[29:53] dwelt along with his thoughts but he
[29:56] said he'll never do that again
[30:00] he said because we are those attributes
[30:08] made manifest
[30:10] he will never dwell alone again that's
[30:14] wonderful to think about that before the
[30:17] world he saw you and knew what you would
[30:22] do well then you sound like and all this
[30:26] predestination sound like we don't have
[30:28] nothing to do with it just remember he
[30:33] saw you in his mind saying that he knew
[30:38] you would say that so don't think that
[30:42] way try to understand the simplicity of
[30:47] God in his ways of doing things instead
[30:50] of trying to figure out what he's doing
[30:55] the Genesis 1:26 man then when was that
[30:58] man brought into being I don't use the
[31:00] word create because I want to use the
[31:02] word brought into being creates fine if
[31:04] you didn't know what you're doing that
[31:09] was before the Prophet said before the
[31:11] foundation of the world before the
[31:16] foundation of the world
[31:18] this 1:26
[31:19] 27 men came into being as a spiritual
[31:23] man because God was a spirit and he
[31:26] created man in his own image but Rena
[31:29] said he created man in the theophany he
[31:31] said because he was at the optic well
[31:35] that's in words that get me all confused
[31:37] it's just getting the simplicity when
[31:41] God created man he created him in the
[31:43] image of himself because he is an
[31:46] expansion of himself a child of God is
[31:52] an expansion of the Father right means
[31:58] that truth because the life comes from
[32:00] the father right
[32:03] see then as he brings us into being upon
[32:06] the earth he knows whether or not you're
[32:10] going to accept him or not you don't
[32:17] think about like brother Branham major
[32:19] statement one time I love his dog he
[32:22] said said now you you some of you said
[32:25] maybe you remember how the things was
[32:28] just a little different with you he said
[32:32] how you were different than the other
[32:33] children around you he said could that
[32:38] be God's Way of doing nothing now if the
[32:42] angels were assigned to the errors of
[32:45] salvation that angel wouldn't have to
[32:48] wait until you're born again to come
[32:50] true you would he could be with you all
[32:54] of your life yeah but I've never seen
[33:01] angels or anything like that well that's
[33:04] all right don't you believe it I mean
[33:08] you know what else you're going to do
[33:09] only the redeemed of angels so then only
[33:12] the redeemed have someone to help them
[33:14] because it's for the heirs of salvation
[33:19] you don't realize what happened to you
[33:21] maybe the day that you became a
[33:25] born-again Christian I remember a
[33:28] brother telling the story one time
[33:31] and the story was that the brother
[33:35] branham told him said other words said
[33:39] they drug you here said you just through
[33:41] a bad time of coming and said they drug
[33:44] you here he went to the brother and
[33:47] asked him this other one did said what
[33:49] he don't know I got in the car went up
[33:51] her he he didn't know his even going
[33:55] home but God was dragging him up there
[33:59] bringing him to a place yeah but you
[34:01] sound like that your predestination is
[34:04] got something to do with what we do I'm
[34:10] glad you thought of that because that's
[34:16] exactly what I believe I believe you've
[34:19] got to accept Jesus Christ as your
[34:21] Savior not that he's going to make you
[34:29] he can't make you and override your
[34:31] Fremont agency
[34:33] I liked well brother Tom far boys used
[34:37] to say he said we trigger our own
[34:39] predestination I like that idea we do
[34:42] trigger our predestination in other
[34:45] words our predestination by God's
[34:46] foreknowledge but then we're here in
[34:49] life we're living each day now listen
[34:56] now then to get to a point is it
[35:01] necessary that I read as I can surely
[35:04] give you a whole lot or to know that but
[35:07] brother branham he said I'll just run
[35:10] through these real fast he said in the
[35:13] church eggs book he said I don't believe
[35:15] in the Mormon doctrine of pre existence
[35:18] of souls he said neither do I believe in
[35:23] reincarnation our transmigration you
[35:30] know reincarnation means you've
[35:31] something here and you come over to
[35:32] something else and knowledge that no
[35:34] transmigration means that you're going
[35:36] from one body to another and he said I
[35:39] don't believe in that but he believed in
[35:43] predestination
[35:45] all Bible believers believe in
[35:47] predestination one by God's
[35:50] foreknowledge and he said it's not to
[35:54] person their 154 church it's not the
[36:00] person that kind of predestination
[36:01] eternally from God it's the word or seed
[36:04] I thought we went to a sermon for you to
[36:09] remember these things that was laying
[36:11] down via River what I'm saying now I
[36:13] thought we went to a message where we
[36:16] were talking about that God first dwelt
[36:18] along with his dog and he said it wasn't
[36:22] word yet he said then his thoughts
[36:27] became word he said then it could be
[36:30] spoken if there's anything about you and
[36:36] me and anything is the fact of accepting
[36:39] God's Word I wish you'd get that into
[36:41] your mind why is it you're different
[36:44] than anybody else you accepted what God
[36:46] said when others wouldn't accept it when
[36:55] others wouldn't have it which is just
[36:57] something about it that it rung into you
[36:59] when you heard the word when the truth
[37:04] struck our pipe is just something
[37:06] different he said well I don't
[37:09] understand that one thing about it ain't
[37:11] what it used to be it might not be what
[37:14] I need to be or one baby ain't what he
[37:16] used to be
[37:17] something's don't happen to me and it
[37:19] happened because I heard the word how
[37:28] long did it take that angel to get you
[37:29] in that place to listen to that word I
[37:33] told you I'm on his eye I'm not joking
[37:37] I'm honest I kind of believe that he
[37:40] assigned to two men keep up with me cuz
[37:42] it was gonna be too bad you know
[37:44] I don't think one angel was capable of
[37:46] handling at all I'm just saying that as
[37:49] a point but it's the truth and I'm
[37:53] certainly going to apologize to it when
[37:55] I get started
[37:57] I've seen a few things in my life it
[38:00] made me wonder about a lot of other
[38:02] things too but that's all right now
[38:04] listen so then I'm just trying to back
[38:09] ground enough for you to think now if
[38:15] you believe let's get the point just
[38:17] come down prove it Lester if you believe
[38:20] the Bible that the lamb was slain before
[38:25] the foundation of the world and all the
[38:27] names were written in that book see we
[38:32] got all that stories you know that's a
[38:33] new name written down in glory we get
[38:35] all those things we think it's good but
[38:38] just remember brother Branham will even
[38:41] talk about a name transferred just
[38:43] remember he's not talking about eternal
[38:46] life eternal life is eternal life that's
[38:52] why the people can't understand brother
[38:54] Branham brother Brent said we always was
[38:56] eternal but read what he said if you
[38:59] have eternal life eternal life always
[39:04] was eternal now you've got plain enough
[39:07] sense if you ain't come up here and
[39:09] somebody bring me a hammer and let's
[39:11] illustrate to make sure that you
[39:12] understand that you're still human and
[39:14] if you're not eternal and let me tap
[39:17] that toe and see how you feel he said
[39:20] well that's silly no it's not silly it's
[39:22] expressing it oh I always loved eternal
[39:25] what are you getting older for come on
[39:30] you're defeating your own purpose and
[39:33] you always was eternal because you're
[39:37] trying to believe with something about
[39:38] you to be in eternal other than what the
[39:41] Bible and the Prophet is explaining
[39:43] because I'm a firm believer in pre
[39:45] existence of eternal life and I believe
[39:50] that eternal life that you receive the
[39:52] day you were born again always was
[39:56] eternal but you had to receive it I
[40:01] believe the Bible says the lamb stood
[40:05] slain before the foundation of the world
[40:07] but what if he hadn't
[40:09] in 2000 years ago on Calvary what if he
[40:16] did not do it it would prove to be false
[40:19] prophecy right so then aren't thinking
[40:22] all right you're thinking we admit that
[40:26] before the foundation of the world that
[40:28] we talk about the the book of life being
[40:31] written
[40:31] well that's names we talk about the
[40:36] morning starts saying togetherness under
[40:38] God shouted for joy and that's for the
[40:40] foundation of world because their names
[40:44] were written in the book come on I got
[40:47] them laying here if you want you order
[40:49] done Rhett you've read them over and
[40:51] over I'll give them to you every time
[40:54] see then for sure we are to understand
[40:57] that to Genesis 1:26 and 27 lamb it's
[41:01] not a physical being your prophet
[41:03] explained it over and over and over and
[41:05] over then he's a spiritual being was
[41:09] even made before the foundation of the
[41:11] world was he created before the world or
[41:20] did God just start expanding himself
[41:24] I thought from Christ a mystery of God
[41:27] revealed it was in order to let himself
[41:30] be expressed that he had a plan and a
[41:34] purpose of hidden mystery a hidden
[41:41] mystery one that this man that was
[41:47] created in Genesis 1:26 27 he never had
[41:50] no beginning and he will never have an
[41:55] ende comes s guards impartation of his
[41:58] own life yet we get it all tied up in
[42:04] two ways and trying to think out things
[42:06] that should have accepted it as simple
[42:08] to believe that God before the world
[42:12] ever begun he had a plan and a purpose
[42:16] according to Christ a mystery of God
[42:17] revealed that he was going to have to
[42:20] express himself
[42:22] now listen to what I'm saying for a
[42:25] second we talked about him being a
[42:29] healer
[42:30] if you had an attribute to be a healer
[42:33] we talked about that right had you ever
[42:35] thought about why he's a healer but I'm
[42:43] just asking you ever thought about why
[42:45] he wanted to be a healer I said another
[42:51] day pondering that thought you know I
[42:52] why did he want to be a healer what he
[42:56] just wanted to show that he could that
[42:58] he could heal him
[43:02] it's alright but why did he want to be a
[43:06] healer not listening to the prophet and
[43:09] he gave the key he wanted to be a healer
[43:15] where he could display the attribute of
[43:19] the Resurrection now are you listening
[43:27] he wanted to be a healer so he could
[43:30] display the attribute of the
[43:32] Resurrection now may I quote brother
[43:36] Branham about 4,000 times no divine
[43:39] healing no resurrection is it because
[43:45] the divine healing is just an earnest of
[43:48] your full inheritance and he wouldn't
[43:53] want to just be a healer for the purpose
[43:56] of somebody being sick and him like him
[43:58] well because every time anybody's sick
[44:02] and is made well if showing the
[44:04] resurrection isn't he wanted to show the
[44:09] resurrection maybe we'll get around to
[44:13] more I'm just saying I get it maybe
[44:16] we'll find out why he wanted to be this
[44:17] one you know that there's I've always
[44:19] explained to you and angels worshiping
[44:22] that will make him God he didn't have to
[44:24] create mankind to be a god you know
[44:26] Angels could worship Him and you know
[44:29] that when he created Adam and Eve in the
[44:30] garden that made him father these are
[44:34] not to bring nobody else to be a father
[44:37] maybe one day we'll realize why all of
[44:39] these things are taking place like that
[44:42] this is setting thinking and wondering
[44:43] pondering over the thought and here
[44:45] comes a prophet he said divine healing
[44:51] shows the resurrection see that was his
[44:56] plan to shew the resurrection was come
[45:03] on he would have to go through a
[45:05] resurrection one day himself am i right
[45:11] did Jesus go through a resurrection see
[45:21] it keeps unfolding we go through the
[45:25] point of thinking that well this is just
[45:26] in God's mind yeah but what about being
[45:33] a part of God's mind you know yourself
[45:37] I've always said that I don't want to be
[45:40] what God thought of that's fine it's
[45:43] that's enough for you that's okay I
[45:45] don't want to just be what he thought of
[45:47] because he thought of Judas Iscariot
[45:49] that's what I said there a moment ago
[45:51] the same time that he saw your name and
[45:54] wrote your name in the Lamb's Book a lot
[45:56] he saw somebody else over here and left
[45:59] there is I at the same time didn't how
[46:06] two stories to bring forward who didn't
[46:11] think about the church think about Jesus
[46:14] Christ I know I asked for you to think
[46:19] I'm not the popcorn preachers that can
[46:22] preach real fiest I've never been that
[46:24] I've always just been myself so you have
[46:27] to put up with that part all right
[46:30] I wish you'd get it like one brother one
[46:32] time little brother motors on preaching
[46:34] a certain Church and we were over there
[46:36] and he said he said brother most going
[46:39] priest Martin I said he's gonna preach
[46:43] to us they did all he's a teacher like
[46:44] you know he said but this brother
[46:46] tonight said he's going to run now house
[46:48] and shout
[46:49] glory hallelujah and you thought you
[46:51] know let's see oh wait a minute it kind
[46:54] of looked like I'm throwing off on this
[46:55] over here isn't here he said well what
[46:57] it is he said no no brother boat was
[47:00] supposed to preach that night and the
[47:02] brothers folks preached the night after
[47:03] huh he said he said what it is he said
[47:06] we'll hear from brother mote watch this
[47:07] brothers gonna tell us a shout about it
[47:11] kind of quick to think all right why not
[47:16] think about things the way God does it
[47:21] maybe you need the quotes in the times
[47:24] from the Prophet
[47:24] where did he sends that before the
[47:26] foundation of the world
[47:28] this Genesis 1:26 man come into being
[47:31] are can you put it there by the book of
[47:35] life in the Lamb and the names or can
[47:39] you put it dire by the morning stars
[47:42] sang together nurse under guard shouting
[47:44] for joy
[47:45] where was this 126 man created he was
[47:49] never created he had no beginning
[47:55] remember anything that has a beginning
[47:57] has an ending the beginning reference is
[48:04] not a beginning as we talked about a
[48:06] beginning we know that but it's
[48:11] referencing that they was a starting
[48:13] point to things that are being there
[48:16] happening and can be called a beginning
[48:18] but a real beginning has no beginning no
[48:21] end into a real beginning a real D
[48:24] turning life yeah I firmly believe the
[48:27] words brought around and said he said we
[48:30] always was he trying what's he talking
[48:35] about if we always was eternal one Jesus
[48:39] cries out to die well he just died to
[48:42] where we could come to the point of
[48:43] realizing that we always was it's a good
[48:47] thought a garbage can in it but it's a
[48:50] good call because if he didn't come and
[48:55] pay the price you can't have eternal
[48:56] life he had to give his life to where it
[48:59] could come upon you and I
[49:01] run do you follow me then trying to get
[49:06] you to just think about this Genesis
[49:09] 1:26 man and how he was a spirit man to
[49:14] profit on it
[49:15] he said he was creating the image of God
[49:17] he said he was created in tianni he was
[49:25] created back there he come into being
[49:28] yeah but I got what the Prophet said we
[49:30] buy pie start the ovni
[49:31] that's right we did to come to earth to
[49:34] be flesh to be came here right but Adam
[49:38] didn't bypass his you tell me he did I'm
[49:44] gonna quote the Prophet to you
[49:45] blasphemous name he's especially into
[49:48] the nostrils of Adam we breathe eternal
[49:50] life now you're going to either believe
[49:54] you were doubting with and you're going
[49:55] to do it anyway so don't matter but
[49:58] listen I'm trying to get you to see
[49:59] something the plan of salvation you see
[50:05] why those angels as I said a moment ago
[50:07] they're shouting because they realize
[50:09] they've got something to do with it what
[50:12] about before the world before anything
[50:13] ever comes into being
[50:15] it's all angels realize what they're
[50:18] going to do you know they're doing their
[50:22] part see I can't explain it but I know
[50:28] what the Prophet said he said those
[50:30] fallen angels give us a nature huh
[50:34] they're working on us so it don't matter
[50:37] which side the angels are on they're
[50:39] working on us right the Fallen Angels is
[50:43] working to take us away the true angels
[50:45] are trying to guard us - is that the way
[50:47] the Prophet says he said before that in
[50:50] the garden he said before that could
[50:54] happen he said he put the angels there
[50:58] with swords to guard the way of the Tree
[51:02] of Life because he knew what was on take
[51:06] place what about the angels knowing
[51:09] about it maybe one day we realize what
[51:11] the Prophet said one day
[51:14] when he was talking about something and
[51:16] he said those angels push remember that
[51:24] seventh seal it's in silver he said
[51:29] those angels hush
[51:30] he said because they know that they
[51:36] can't move a move unless it give away
[51:40] the secret nice prior phrase which is
[51:44] pretty close I'll be glad to find that
[51:46] for you he said those angels he said
[51:49] they hush he said everything in heaven
[51:51] huh sure he said that's why they
[51:53] silenced there he said because they
[51:58] can't say nothing it would give away the
[52:01] secret what's the secret
[52:03] according to Christ the mystery of God
[52:04] revealed when we started operating long
[52:06] ago or quoting what he say to express
[52:10] himself so then can you think about this
[52:18] man of one 26 and 27 is being a spirit
[52:25] man a part of God Genesis 2:7 they asked
[52:31] him a question remember the Prophet said
[52:35] it like this that he created two he said
[52:39] one was before the foundation world in
[52:41] other words 126 man he said Denny put
[52:46] that 126 man into two seven in a natural
[52:50] creation right but remember in his
[52:55] spiritual creation he was over all the
[52:57] animals remember that do we need to
[53:00] bring all these quotes like somebody
[53:03] said the other days about time to be
[53:04] able to get where we can believe it
[53:06] you're just one thing for sure you out
[53:09] there on the internet anything you want
[53:10] to do something if I say something you
[53:12] write me an Internet now write it and I
[53:14] ain't don't even writing it to me don't
[53:16] do it sensitive Church and join em
[53:17] against me
[53:18] because I can't read them anyway but
[53:20] it's something you want to know about
[53:21] I'll answer them question I ain't
[53:23] answering questions to people on no
[53:24] internet but I will answer where I've
[53:27] got the call
[53:28] from our outcome to the church and shape
[53:33] that was me I've never had no problems
[53:37] with it will stay with the prophets
[53:39] message to see where it works out do you
[53:43] understand what I'm getting at so then
[53:47] there is two creations that we got to
[53:50] deal with one of them is to bring in
[53:57] God's mind into view bring in what he
[54:02] had in his mind his attributes his
[54:04] things and to display those attributes
[54:08] Savior healer Redeemer all the things
[54:11] father God and all the different things
[54:16] but then he brought a natural thing into
[54:19] being a natural creation and the key is
[54:25] to watch what we're going to say
[54:27] anything that has a beginning has an
[54:30] Indian the angels were created of God
[54:36] but they were not a part of God they had
[54:42] a beginning mankind what about it
[54:50] alright they say a picture is better
[54:53] than a thousand words sometimes it's
[54:56] good to use it it confuses everybody so
[54:59] it's better than a thousand words
[55:00] because it'll confuse you better than a
[55:03] thousand words so you can take what you
[55:05] want to where you want it says
[55:07] understand it and help me or what you
[55:09] can say it confuse me so either way the
[55:11] picture is going to do one or the other
[55:12] I wrote the things and I had them to
[55:14] pass out and give you all of the notes
[55:16] of a picture of a drawing and we're
[55:20] going to pull it up on the screen does
[55:21] everybody get one of the drawings
[55:23] everybody get one that there it's doing
[55:26] it and this is brother Dale all right
[55:29] but did you get one too where we can
[55:32] move on that has all of it oh if you
[55:35] don't raise your hand who give them to
[55:37] get parents to give them if they got any
[55:39] more if you don't we'll make some more
[55:42] but see look up here now to creations so
[55:47] don't run all the way down through here
[55:48] now because if anything brother pull
[55:50] that down cuz that's the other way other
[55:53] way go there you go alright let's stop
[55:58] it because see you go down to that and
[55:59] you read all this down today and you're
[56:01] not listening what I'm sayin up here
[56:02] okay
[56:03] so we'll move it up a little at the time
[56:05] alright so look to creations first
[56:14] creation run around said was God Himself
[56:18] has no beginning right
[56:24] God didn't own the beginning his first
[56:28] creation was God himself what did he do
[56:30] he's simply coming forth to show himself
[56:32] to mankind right that's not a creation
[56:37] he didn't create a person and step over
[56:41] get out right away what did he do when
[56:44] the Prophet would say his first creation
[56:46] was God himself did he create this over
[56:49] here or did he step from being self
[56:53] existing over to logos or theophany to
[57:01] speak I put it in the message and I hope
[57:06] you'll listen when I get back to it on
[57:08] the next one I put a special message in
[57:11] this group of what does your God look
[57:15] like brother Branham said Hoffman's head
[57:22] of Christ was the closest he knew of
[57:25] what Jesus looked like I put a thing in
[57:30] there what was his name we know God's
[57:31] name his name is Jesus and we know he's
[57:35] a person that he's not just a myth
[57:37] I put a whole mess two messages in on
[57:40] that thought but was you listening I
[57:43] don't remember that message then we'll
[57:46] go back and listen it's on the internet
[57:51] when it says creation when it said in in
[57:54] Revelation
[57:55] 3:14 that he's the beginning of the
[57:57] creation of God wrote around said that
[58:00] does not mean God created Jesus and
[58:03] Jesus created everything else he said
[58:06] that is cream correct but he said that's
[58:09] what most of the people think about it
[58:12] see that are making two persons we just
[58:16] remember he self-existing he's been
[58:19] trying to condescend to the human being
[58:21] that the human being can understand him
[58:23] the first thing he does is become
[58:28] theophany logos speech but I put that
[58:35] picture in there because we're going to
[58:36] do it when we do the next one probably
[58:38] I enjoyed that one Holly's in Atlanta
[58:43] I've told you about it when they done
[58:45] that thing at the Passion Play and they
[58:50] always do it at different things and
[58:51] this first time they had this man they
[58:53] had this like walls and tongue I mean
[58:55] had it like it was nothing and then this
[58:57] man just stepped out into being and he
[59:03] began to say the letter B I don't know
[59:06] that was respira see you're not
[59:08] listening he said let there be let her
[59:13] be
[59:14] well the world come into being and the
[59:17] different things started happening you
[59:18] know and the next thing you heard was a
[59:21] baby crying on earth the next scene was
[59:28] the same man that was standing there
[59:30] saying let there be standing there as
[59:33] Jesus Christ you don't think like I do
[59:40] you don't think that when God stepped
[59:43] out there there he was real and when he
[59:49] did he just let there be because
[59:54] remember the point of trying to show one
[59:58] God is what Genesis 1 says God created
[1:00:02] all things right
[1:00:06] I guess that father or someone now
[1:00:09] according to John one Colossians one
[1:00:15] Ephesians is a three and nine or is it
[1:00:18] James tree and I wanted to you go to
[1:00:20] Colossians you can go to John and go to
[1:00:22] Hebrews and go then it says Jesus Christ
[1:00:25] created all things well you know what
[1:00:29] why can't you believe that before the
[1:00:31] world that stood Jesus Christ in the
[1:00:35] afternoon that Moses saw in theophany
[1:00:39] one can't you see that that was when it
[1:00:42] said let there be no you still want to
[1:00:44] go back to the spirit why not well we
[1:00:51] don't know it well that was the reason I
[1:00:53] put the message in it your prophet said
[1:00:57] that hoffman's 33 was the most closest
[1:01:02] picture of Jesus Christ that there was
[1:01:04] so then what a Jesus Christ look like
[1:01:10] well we're going to remove this one over
[1:01:16] here but I'm not going to tell you what
[1:01:19] we're going to put up there but we're
[1:01:21] going to remove that side because see
[1:01:22] people don't get my point this is a
[1:01:25] picture made this was a drawing made
[1:01:28] this was the picture made and he dropped
[1:01:30] it down and made it look like he was
[1:01:32] young man compared to this to being the
[1:01:34] old man with all the time so we're going
[1:01:36] to remove it and put something up
[1:01:39] because it'll show what I'm thinking I'm
[1:01:44] trying to explain something to them the
[1:01:46] other day some of us you see we saying
[1:01:50] open the eyes of my heart because that's
[1:01:53] what I'm preaching but don't be
[1:01:58] surprised one day when to come out here
[1:02:00] and I changed the theme song
[1:02:09] because according to what I'm preaching
[1:02:11] is the same song Lord open these eyes
[1:02:16] that we can see I like that when God is
[1:02:25] good all the time I surprised you use
[1:02:32] that as a theme song see I'm trying to
[1:02:36] get you to see what I'm talking about
[1:02:38] wherever the church things only believe
[1:02:39] or this out of the other I do it
[1:02:43] according to what's being made known at
[1:02:45] the time open the aisles Lord of our
[1:02:49] home all right
[1:02:51] so God is not a creation he's just me
[1:02:58] it's just words human words Jesus it
[1:03:01] says the beginning of the creation of
[1:03:03] God that's not God creating God that's
[1:03:07] just God stepping over into human flesh
[1:03:11] that's Jesus standing guard the
[1:03:13] beginning of the creation of God what's
[1:03:16] he doing here he's stepping forward from
[1:03:19] his point of not being able to be able
[1:03:21] to understand him or comprehend him in
[1:03:24] any form and then he just stepped over
[1:03:27] into another form remember the word in
[1:03:29] morphe he changes his form not him
[1:03:31] personality not his big it's corn all
[1:03:34] right look so then once it covered this
[1:03:39] man now watch this all the way through
[1:03:41] because this side of the line watch this
[1:03:43] side of the line all the way through
[1:03:45] there's going to be no creation on that
[1:03:48] side all of this side is going to be God
[1:03:56] unveiling his plan and purpose for
[1:04:00] mankind this will have a beginning
[1:04:05] because he he had a beginning on two
[1:04:09] creations
[1:04:09] this one is eternal this one had a
[1:04:12] beginning to follow this alter anything
[1:04:15] that had a beginning is not part of God
[1:04:18] but a creation of God
[1:04:23] that's why I don't just be in the mind
[1:04:26] of God because Satan was in the mind of
[1:04:27] God Judas was in the mind of God I want
[1:04:30] to be a part of the mind that does the
[1:04:32] thinking I want that part of me I
[1:04:35] thought that's what Paul said he said
[1:04:36] where's Christ and eula ability to think
[1:04:39] histology is that Scripture okay Roland
[1:04:43] oh no this we going out that away
[1:04:47] naturally fits Dejan you go which way
[1:04:49] you go okay so the Genesis 1:26 man made
[1:04:54] in the image of God not created part of
[1:04:59] God sons and daughters of God eternal
[1:05:03] life was before the foundation of the
[1:05:08] world well when did that we'll bring it
[1:05:13] on down to the court Connor okay
[1:05:15] look on the other side what was the
[1:05:17] first in like I said it here's brother
[1:05:18] Branham see you're reading brother
[1:05:20] Branham in that mind of yours read and
[1:05:22] he says God was his first creation I
[1:05:25] can't see three times then he says the
[1:05:28] first creation was like rosu it ought to
[1:05:32] be able to holler with alan remember in
[1:05:38] the bible life came into being before
[1:05:40] the moon and the sun king remember life
[1:05:46] it didn't come into being
[1:05:49] it was wherever God is is like am i
[1:05:54] right you need an example of it you
[1:05:58] remember in Goshen where the children of
[1:06:01] Israel was that it was like you remember
[1:06:04] outside it was darkness see there is no
[1:06:09] such thing as darkness cause darkness is
[1:06:11] announcements of light so when it says
[1:06:13] in the beginning there that he created
[1:06:15] life it didn't create light he just
[1:06:18] stepped over into another form and it
[1:06:20] just lit up right he didn't have to
[1:06:25] create it teachers ever where he's at
[1:06:27] now quotes from what scripture how about
[1:06:31] when we get over to the future at home
[1:06:32] you
[1:06:33] have no need of the light I'm according
[1:06:36] Christian because the lamb is the light
[1:06:41] is that scripture we're still in the
[1:06:44] Bible whether you're out every what
[1:06:46] you're doing with it we're still in the
[1:06:48] scripture see then this Genesis 1:26 man
[1:06:53] if God made manifest in another form
[1:06:56] bringing forth his bride okay then you
[1:07:01] get angels created that's what I'm
[1:07:04] saying you could at any mine you see
[1:07:06] first creation was life first creation
[1:07:09] was God first race was angel which ones
[1:07:12] right all three of them all the above
[1:07:17] because angels was the first thing that
[1:07:20] was made or created don't worry about it
[1:07:25] we we're talking we got some things and
[1:07:28] just remember just don't go too far
[1:07:30] we're thinking because remember Michael
[1:07:32] wasn't an angel okay we've got no
[1:07:38] problem with that we're studying it
[1:07:40] Michael was crushed and I have a little
[1:07:44] problem with Gabriel fitting him in
[1:07:47] there exactly yet but don't worry about
[1:07:48] it be nice you come to here you come in
[1:07:52] here go get him it's far but you
[1:07:55] remember there's two similar kind of
[1:07:57] angels there's cherubims there
[1:07:59] sheriffing seraphim's keep the worshiper
[1:08:02] clean
[1:08:03] that's Michael's job whatever who's with
[1:08:07] him is Michael job okay just show you we
[1:08:10] talk we get a little discussion in going
[1:08:12] down the road we ride and kind of talk
[1:08:16] well look angels retirin said with god's
[1:08:20] first creation exactly right he created
[1:08:24] angels angel had a beginning they're not
[1:08:27] part of God but was created by God they
[1:08:30] had a part to do in God's purpose plan
[1:08:33] and purpose that's the reason that came
[1:08:37] into being because they were going to be
[1:08:40] there to help us they're helping you
[1:08:43] right now what's keeping you from what
[1:08:44] happened you're going down the road in
[1:08:46] the car
[1:08:47] in front of your dog runs in front of
[1:08:48] the cow running from something happens
[1:08:50] in you have you ever been worded you
[1:08:57] were planning on going some way and
[1:08:58] something just said go the other way and
[1:09:00] you just turn and go the other way and
[1:09:01] you don't know why I just said I'm up
[1:09:06] all the guys that angel because I have
[1:09:07] problems and I won't argue with him
[1:09:10] don't you he keeps trying to tell me
[1:09:15] this that or the other either while I
[1:09:17] listen to him you know I'm you doing
[1:09:20] okay come on
[1:09:22] now look city spiritual man 126 placed
[1:09:30] in the garden Carew over every time
[1:09:35] actually 126 man spiritual man the
[1:09:41] beginning of the natural creation of the
[1:09:42] world animals things he created Adam in
[1:09:50] flesh created the soul of Adam was not
[1:09:58] created that's blasphemous name come on
[1:10:03] Adam had eternal life with Adam in flesh
[1:10:08] 2:7 had a beginning as a creation of God
[1:10:13] much but not part of God Adams flesh was
[1:10:18] not part of God it was God's creation
[1:10:22] your body or whatever you want think
[1:10:24] about it until it's made eternal it's
[1:10:27] not a part part of God it's just a part
[1:10:30] of these ol animals out here Wade was
[1:10:33] looking at a thing until it seems about
[1:10:35] some deer or something on the thing and
[1:10:38] I looked her I said hey I heard Bigfoot
[1:10:43] it was him standing working over here in
[1:10:47] the back of it went dark and our little
[1:10:49] Bigfoot
[1:10:50] then we found him brothers okay you see
[1:10:57] spiritual man he's in the garden
[1:11:00] this is still eternal but this is time
[1:11:04] starting and is it starting all of these
[1:11:08] things coming into being they are
[1:11:10] created of God but they're not eternal
[1:11:14] come on up I can't get it all in the way
[1:11:17] I wanted now look the fall
[1:11:21] Adam placing the time body and fell
[1:11:23] I see into death but this man in Adam
[1:11:28] never failed
[1:11:29] Adam fail but it's so never fail that's
[1:11:35] why I've been with you argued with you
[1:11:36] over priest about it we're ready Ryan
[1:11:39] says in the sealed book he talking about
[1:11:41] Adam fell from eternal life now he tells
[1:11:45] you over and over that you can't have
[1:11:47] eternal life and lose it right God is
[1:11:52] not an Indian giver right okay so what
[1:11:55] happened to Adam Adam never reached the
[1:11:58] eternal life that should have come into
[1:12:00] being had they not been that part of the
[1:12:04] fall we should have come forth and Adams
[1:12:08] body would have been laid eternal but
[1:12:11] now you tell me what's the difference
[1:12:12] now did not you receive eternal life in
[1:12:17] your soul what is it not that this body
[1:12:20] is coming to the place of redemption is
[1:12:23] that not what it hit see this man the
[1:12:29] man of 1 26 and 27
[1:12:31] he never failed now just in case you
[1:12:38] want to go into some terminologies and
[1:12:40] try to run that computer a little bit 5
[1:12:43] star for a minute
[1:12:44] let's put it on hold and think about it
[1:12:46] you say that well he just created Adam
[1:12:53] that was on the creation brother Branham
[1:12:58] says the 1:26 man was a man and he said
[1:13:04] not an EM a in and when they put it in
[1:13:09] the book they're supposed to put em
[1:13:11] period a period in period because that
[1:13:14] would have been
[1:13:14] runs it not a em a n he said immunity
[1:13:19] created man there was only one of them
[1:13:24] that man was Jesus Christ
[1:13:26] I thought we believed it over in genesis
[1:13:31] 3:15 he said I'll put the enmity between
[1:13:35] though I thought that was a promise for
[1:13:37] the first coming of Jesus Christ
[1:13:39] I thought Adam was standing there just
[1:13:42] exactly like Jesus Christ was when he
[1:13:44] came on her eternal in soul the body not
[1:13:48] eternal coolness out into Jesus coming
[1:13:51] up all right but to fall put man and
[1:13:53] everything to death okay
[1:13:55] spiritual man Jesus had no beginning in
[1:13:59] his soul his body was not eternal but
[1:14:03] his soul was eternal or else you're
[1:14:07] going to have to have another person and
[1:14:08] how to three times all right but God
[1:14:11] placed in flesh and what moved him over
[1:14:16] here where we can get the connection God
[1:14:18] stepped down in human flesh you become a
[1:14:23] part of us eternal life in his soul but
[1:14:27] his body was not eternal he had to give
[1:14:33] his life and when we're getting through
[1:14:38] see Calvary released the soul the
[1:14:43] disciples walking with Jesus heard the
[1:14:45] word and they went to Pentecost they're
[1:14:53] going to the next and you'll see that
[1:14:54] there's no line because it just mingles
[1:14:56] together see Pentecost Holy Ghost came
[1:14:58] in two disciples they become a new
[1:15:01] creation in Christ Jesus
[1:15:02] eternal a new creature doesn't mean a
[1:15:07] different creature in Paul saying the
[1:15:10] new creature in Christ Jesus it's not
[1:15:12] saying that he created a
[1:15:15] this is this man Jesus Christ made
[1:15:18] manifest I thought this holy ghost it
[1:15:20] was released at Calvary commended
[1:15:22] disciples who made our souls eternally I
[1:15:25] thought we had eternal life right now in
[1:15:27] our soul
[1:15:28] by the new birth weighting the
[1:15:30] redemption of the body waiting to a time
[1:15:33] that these bodies can take on
[1:15:35] immortality what do you see what I'm
[1:15:38] talking about then there was two
[1:15:40] creations this tape runs message you
[1:15:44] don't throw it away because you think
[1:15:46] you found a contradiction wait on God
[1:15:50] he'll answer it someone he'll bring it
[1:15:55] forward when he created life that was
[1:15:59] his first part over here because he was
[1:16:01] like and him was no darkness whatsoever
[1:16:04] so what he started to do God just
[1:16:06] started condescending downward whatever
[1:16:09] word can you knew stepping down in
[1:16:11] morphing himself from one form to
[1:16:13] another form as we come forth to be
[1:16:16] lower at theophany and then he began to
[1:16:18] speak and say let there be that's what I
[1:16:23] hope you'll see though that that man
[1:16:27] that was standing there saying let there
[1:16:28] be was that the army of Almighty God not
[1:16:32] the human place for Jesus Christ no wait
[1:16:35] now
[1:16:37] that's why read your scriptures and you
[1:16:41] think it don't mean nothing but read
[1:16:43] your scriptures when he said to him who
[1:16:45] demand say out of Son of Man a.m.
[1:16:47] he said thou art the Christ
[1:16:51] now what if Heda stopped her he defined
[1:16:55] who was standing there he said thou art
[1:16:59] the Christ the Son of the Living God
[1:17:05] what was Peters declaration what is the
[1:17:08] church built on that Jesus was
[1:17:10] all-mighty God in human flesh body of
[1:17:16] creation soul at no beginning spirit at
[1:17:20] no beginning put the soul and spirit
[1:17:24] into the body of Jesus and you got a man
[1:17:27] standing on earth what happened to Adam
[1:17:31] in the garden he put the number one man
[1:17:35] into the two you put Genesis 1 into
[1:17:39] Genesis 2
[1:17:41] and what was that understanding a child
[1:17:43] of God the Bible calls him the only one
[1:17:47] it's in the old customer had him Bible
[1:17:50] called him a son of God I know we're
[1:17:53] with our when he looked down in and so
[1:17:55] the three standing them in her I've
[1:17:57] expressed that nicka desire who is it
[1:18:00] that but God looks down in and he said
[1:18:02] we throw it in during a forum dinner and
[1:18:04] he said one of them is like the son of
[1:18:06] God because he knew he could see it it
[1:18:11] had to have a form and he knew if it
[1:18:15] could walk in the fire it had to be God
[1:18:17] come on church the word is so perfect to
[1:18:23] just simply think about it that God in
[1:18:26] the beginning
[1:18:27] communism God in the beginning before
[1:18:30] anything he had a plan and a purpose in
[1:18:32] mind to let himself be expressed and as
[1:18:37] he was letting himself be expressed he
[1:18:40] stepped forth from one form to another
[1:18:44] he just keeps stepping forward until in
[1:18:48] the end time he's stepping forward now
[1:18:50] and what he really wanted you realized
[1:18:54] that Jesus went through a change you
[1:18:58] make his body eternal you realize that's
[1:19:01] what we're facing
[1:19:02] that's why Satan is fighting so hard
[1:19:05] he's fighting so hard in this last days
[1:19:09] because he's going to people to realize
[1:19:11] what's going on but I say around the
[1:19:15] world the Bride of Christ is beginning
[1:19:18] to realize who they are and they're here
[1:19:20] for a purpose
[1:19:22] we're here to make God manifest come on
[1:19:27] am i quoting the Bible or the prophets
[1:19:30] what I'm saying he's not to step on
[1:19:31] earth again we're to meet him in there
[1:19:34] well then who is he who are we where God
[1:19:38] made manifest on earth called a bride

[1:19:45] getting ready so you gotta get fine to
[1:19:47] one
[1:20:01] when the message beginning and ending of
[1:20:03] the Gentile dispensation watching flip
[1:20:05] between sons of God and angels said were
[1:20:10] was you when I laid the foundation of
[1:20:14] the world before elated when the sons of
[1:20:17] God sang together and the morning stars
[1:20:21] shouted for joy he's flipping the -
[1:20:23] what's he the morning star shouted for
[1:20:26] joy them shining ones shouted for joy
[1:20:32] when they seen that some day they would
[1:20:38] cover knuckle here on earth and the King
[1:20:42] Melchizedek would come in the
[1:20:44] righteousness of God and give his life
[1:20:46] to redeem us man

[1:20:56] it's displaying showing by top like the
[1:21:00] whole Bible remember across the mystery
[1:21:03] God revealed he said the whole Bible is
[1:21:05] a planning of a hobo
[1:21:07] God coming together with a redeemed wife
[1:21:10] a bride that God had in his mind before
[1:21:15] the foundation of the world
[1:21:18] he's coming forth in that way it's left
[1:21:21] over you and I to decide where we go or
