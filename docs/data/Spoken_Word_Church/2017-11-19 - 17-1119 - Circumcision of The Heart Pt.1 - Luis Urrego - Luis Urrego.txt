========================================

okay good morning everybody don't wear your boots not gonna go anywhere you know it'll stay right there on those warmers justice uh but just let's warm our heart with the word just one concentrate on the word any man that's more important praise the Lord this morning we want to talk about a about circumcision of the heart this for the butter sneezed and I think carefully that's my sister Barbara's husband right if I got twenty long ball good we're fine I got one yeah we don't work no i got sterling all right all right listen we're going to talk about circumcision of the heart and we all know how important god instituted circumcision and back in the old testament not necessarily as that's something that we have to do now although it is still practice especially amongst the jews but the whole thing that god was boiling down to is that is that out he was more concerned about the heart than anything else and of course he could not get that through to the people of the Old Testament because the people of the Old Testament they were more like the people they're aware were like physical people's so they needed more fleshly physical type numb and they were they're a rough rough rough people back then you know and so you'd have to deal with them in this way so we're gonna kind of go through this and of course we're not going to get done we're gonna try to get done with what I have here but there's gonna be a part two because there's lots involved in this topic and though now you start studying in and it just leads to one thing to another one think there another somewhere so you're blessed sorry I'll get her stuff so circumcision of the heart what is circumcision and what does it mean to be spiritually circumcised they meant now in Colossians chapter 2 verse 8 through 14 says this beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and that's Jesus Christ right in ye and ye are complete in him I like that how Paul says that you are completely not that you will be and at this very moment it might not seem like it made me steal stumbling and fall in and in there but you are complete the Bible says I want to confess what the word says emigrate and you are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power verse 11 in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands that's right amen so this is not something visible in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ so it's talking about two circumcisions here a physical circumcision and the circumcision of Christ I've been buried with him in Baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who had raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the SIRT uncircumcision of your flesh in it have he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses so Paul here is telling us that before we come to Christ we were uncircumcised in the flesh spiritually all right all right you could good I mean you could go out here and do whatever you wanted to and now feel not one remorse of not one thing go out here smoke cigarettes drink hangout perrales do whatever and I didn't feel not one thing about nothing bothered me in my heart but once once Christ come and I and I saw and the law in I've been reading in Romans the book of Romans my wife and I've been reading the book of Romans and how Paul lays that out up there and speaking about circumcision and how the knowledge of the law allowed me to have knowledge of what was wrong in my life you see what I'm saying in other words the knowledge of the word because without all of us have when we come to this world we have a conscience you know some people know that there are certain things that are wrong and and some certain things that are not wrong but but that wasn't really settled until Christ's payment of body my holy spirit huns and the bonds in your heart amen praise the Lord verse 14 says blotting out the handwriting of Ordinances that was against us which was contrary which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross amen I like that yeah that means it was dead am ia man lately praise the Lord so the word circumcision at me it comes from the Latin word means sequence CCO and I can say that because it's from the left see the boom sees you maybe I can't speak let a lot of things are they say Latin I'd say so spending garage from day one huh I'm tingling not that one it's hard yeah I think that that's right sounds like it's only down here in the south yeah c'est comme si Co comes from circum meaning around and cadet meaning to cut a mint so we are all adults here and we know what happens in circumcision by hand limit on the eighth day this was practiced by the Jews they cut the foreskin of the little baby representing something which we were going to get to in just a moment and of course to this day they still practice it now not all the countries it's it's required to for you to search inside your child but but in some countries state they just do it and then praise God now in the 12 13th and 15th chapters of Genesis God had made the following of unconditional promises to Abraham and if you read if you read those chapters up you'll see everything more things in detail but this is kind of break down that his descendants would be more numerous than the stars in the sky and that his seat would be as the dust of the earth the dust of the earth the Bible said not not the dust of what for civic life but the dust of the earth amen yes it's amazing that through his descendants all the nations would be blessed right and that Abraham's people would be given a great land to occupy and that all who bless them would in turn be blessed of course those who cursed them for the curse and mentally praised God and God gave Abraham the these unconditional promises first and then later in Genesis 17 God changes his name from Abram to Abraham and gives him the sign that he was going to keep those promises in verse 11 so he gives him these unconditional promises first and when God gives a promise he don't break those Broncos right but he but he then he gives Abraham a sign to show that he was going to keep these these promises he was so we read here in Genesis 17 I want you to just read with me he says this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee so see he was expecting for this covenant to be kept after the seed of Abraham as well right remember thinking in your mind that this is a key thing in God this is all people he was more relating to the spiritual aspect of it but of course he had to start physical right and then you can go with a lot in that amen but uh but so just continue reading here every man child among you shall be circumcised that's the word of the Lord right and ye shall circumcise verse 11 ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and there shall be a token meaning a sign right of the Covenant betwixt me and you I would love for God to be talk talking to me like that this is a covenant between me and you Abraham doesn't come to between me and you sister cannot come between you me and you brother wait in the restaurant descended on for just right verse 12 and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seat so in other words people who would wanted to join or walk with the people of Israel at that time they had to be circumcised for mob because this was a sign that differentiated them from the rest of the people right he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with my money must needs be circumcised you see how the Bible words that and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant now if you know if you see underline that because the word everlasting doesn't mean eternal that's right there's a temper there is a temporary time amen so I'm just wondering this is me thinking I'm just wondering if God's thinking this is only gonna be for temporary start again it's not gonna be in the flesh and him over later on it's gonna come into the heart praise God now that's the ever that's the eternal colour a memory and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his fortune isn't the foreskin is not circumcised look I said that soul shall be cut off from his people he had broken my covenant so to me is I'm reading this I don't know about you but I'm reading also the spiritual aspect of it as well amen God referring to the soul amen yes at the same time he's dealing with physical and aspect of it as well so God he was going to keep his covenant to Abraham with no strings attached and he used circumcision as a sign amen now it was important to God to physically show forth the promise he had made to Abraham why because he wanted it to be visible he wanted it to be shown he wanted it to - for them also who had the circumcision applied to them to see hey especially a male hey I'm part of I'm part of God's name I'm taking I'm part of this covenant amen hey cuz I see it myself and then if anybody else wants to know hey - oh man that's and that's the reason why he instituted instituted circumcision as a sign now God still shows forth signs in order to confirm the promises he has made to us in his word such promises far today are included but not limited to the vindication of Malachi 4:2 us okay men I'm just giving some examples here the cloud in Arizona sign of the opening when God pillow program to go preach the seven seals is there God was going to open that but most importantly God given us the holy go game amen thus that's so that's the promise that God will fulfill if you do your part but I know if you do your part he'll do this and that's just that's just as simple as that he meant but what did jesus said jesus said give the Holy Ghost to them that obey Him my truck alright Emma do so Abraham he had to believe upon that sign of circumcision before he he could act upon it right he had to actually and if you read the background of Abraham I mean he's here God's talking to Abraham and can you imagine Abraham you know got a man that a person that he cannot even see which later on he see he's telling him to leave his country I only have to do all these different things and he has to have faith that that voice is leading him in the right direction that's uh that's that's faith saying amen but Abraham he couldn't believe on that sign or he until of that sinusoid position and to uh you have to believe upon it first in order for him to act on it mercy and that's the same thing with you and me you know when it comes to salvation you have to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ amen and then God can do his his part you see you have to feel I believe on the Lord then God can fill you with the Holy Spirit amen amen so in Abraham believing that son and obey nahee was believing the word that God had made him back to Genesis 12 and 15 same thing with us today and in order for us to benefit from having our heart circumcised by the Holy Ghost we must we must have faith in the promises of God through his word because you can't believe the word of first on the unless is presented to you then you can act upon it until it's presented to you it hurts you seniors and I like I put Ephesians chapter 1 because it I like this it ties in with it says verse 13 and whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth so you trusted in that word of right amen and it was after that ye heard the word of truth is it's when you trusted in the driver because I mean you can't believe on something unless you hear the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise again let's look back at Abraham it wasn't until he believed God that's why he's considered such a great man in Hebrews it talks about him how his faith was great him and all that because he believed God amen he believed God when nervous all he was was just hearing God but yet he still believed him amen and all we have today is the word you know jesus said that jesus said blessed are your eyes amen but I said blessed are you who believed in them and then have something physical to be presented to you see I wasn't there in brother Browns meetings I wasn't there in those in those healing campaigns and those things those physical things amen but you're more blessed that you believe now even though you weren't in there that's right you're more black sighted and so he when Jesus told Thomas he said Thomas blessed are those who believe and did not even see did not even require physical physical contact or anything like that you see a lot of people we think that we have to feel something you know when I can when I came to the message it wasn't like this in the Baptist Church when I was in the Baptist Church you know it it was just you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and and the Bible said it so you believe it and you go on that's almost a up almost a little bit more faith than we do here in the message we think we have to feel something and we have to run and shout in order for us to think that we received something from the service so when I came into the message and then I started hearing the preaching and things like that I felt like I had to get up and shout and run all over the place and do things like that I don't for me to get something but later on God revealed to me men it's not all those things are great there's nothing wrong with them anyway you know if you you know if God deals with you in that way praise the Lord but some of us God God doesn't deal with us in in the same way you know someone was a little bit more quiet more reserved but doesn't mean God's not speaking in your heart it doesn't mean that the word is not having an effect in your life and that you're not changing from day to day and that's right praise God so it's easy for those who who are to be critical those who are a little bit more Pentecostal to be critical of those are a little bit more quiet right right and then those that are more quiet you'll be critical of those they're a little bit more Pentecostal after Satan right there has to be a balance we have to respect one another and respect how the Lord wants to deal with especially in the services they met here praise God because God deals with us in different ways as long as the word is being fulfilled and as long as the word is changing you from day to day amen you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise verse 14 which is the earnest of our inheritance by the way speaking about the inheritance their brother team humans amen which was awesome until the redemption of the purchased possession of it amen so this circumcision that God gave to Abraham was was just the earnest in other words of what the real circumcision of that God was really to get to amen in other words it was the down payment right that's right same thing with us amen the the earnest of our inheritance the Holy Ghost that we received is just the earnest for just the downpayment of the full full Redemption and it meant to our bodies they managed right oh praise God this is just one little part that's it one little one little part but it's glorious even I mean just to be able to have this part a minute just this little part can you imagine when we get that body changing having that full Redemption it says until the redemption of the purchased possession payment got priced up for you and me yes whenever the purchased possession part yes you promised this amen the full redemption praise God unto the praise of his glory praise the Lord Amen now brother Branham says here he says and if he has never circumsized you yet by the Holy Ghost he hasn't received your faith yet that's right that is the circumcision of the heart and spirit God gives the Holy Ghost as a confirmation that he has received your faith now if you stop believing in scrum bling I'm not sure if that was a typo in the message or if he actually said that bit of it will just go too strongly around not scrambling eggs and scrambling around and just believe God God will circumcise that heart is his promise even ahead and that cuts off all unbelief circumcised is the world and all unbelief away from you and then you stand the word alone jesus said if ye abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will it'll be given to you that's what's the matter with the church today it's under emotion it's under education it's under Creed no wonder its mother down see so we need a circumcision to cut the whole thing away come back to God and His Word and believe it the way it's wrote there that's how Abraham did was believe exactly what God said and acted upon that it's wrote there and don't argue with it just stay with it God made a promise God keeps his promise he can't do nothing else but keep his promise and remain God amen so if the word says it we can put our we can bank we can bank on it amen that God's going to fulfill that it in that room now the Rite of circumcision was continued in the time of Moses it was made part of the law of Moses several hundred years later when God gave instruction concerning the birth of a male and we see that in Leviticus 1213 where it says and in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised they meant letting us know that God never changed this mind about his word while he had told Abraham maybe 100 years before or several hundred years before he was still getting the children that his people they meant to continue practicing the same thing right you know this was still physical right amen this and so that God does not change my advice but since he told Abraham that this was the Covenant that he was making with his seed also we just read that just a moment ago so just because you're under a new administration or messenger God's Word did not change concerning certain Sarah now in our day brother Brandon - our messenger for our day he didn't come to give us a new Bible everything that brother Branham preached was already landlord amen he was was restoring you that there was eaten know that right nothing new there's not a new thing for women to have long hair there was not a new thing for us to go to church and knowledge you know just different things that brother Branham had to constantly preaching it to the Pentecostal babies at the time right none of that was new it was just restoring back they meant nothing had changed what moment Moses came on the scene the word still remain the same nothing look nothing has changed God's Word still remains the same favorite and there our day is not physical circumcision right it's spiritual circumcision they God is looking for him and the Holy Ghost is they received it back in the day of Pentecost as the same Holy Ghost that we received today and it's got to come the same way a minute praise the Lord make me a different way no better time there's no there's no modern new birth there are no change in the door when you receive your new birth no there isn't the church it's out you know and even in some message ranks just because you believe the message or because you believe that God sent a prophet you know that that has nothing to do with you being a Christian the press writers for a man a sinner out here could believe God sent a prophet at us day but that doesn't mean that he's in the message or that he's he's Christ dwelling in him and they cried in and he's dwelling in Christ that was right no and we see later that the children of Israel wandered around the wilderness for 40 years after they had come out of Egypt now I don't want to get too much into this because this is leading to what I want to preach about on Tuesday but though I want to look at something here a quick the problem was that they came out of Egypt but Egypt have not come out of saraswathi's right right they thought they thought that they were ready to leave but when they faced the hardships of the out there in the wilderness I'm ready to go back to eat and garlic and onion stays good this man that doesn't taste like anything but God was raining it down automatically on autopilot nobody was pushing a button or nothing God has given them food and God says okay there they're crying for me God sends quails God sends water provides water for them all these things on autopilot just the way we have it today that's right and we still complain that's right that's right we still complain right yeah we could push buttons and we can we can our cars now start with buttons in there right and we still think about that so at some point in the journey this practice of circumcision was stopped and God was concerned about this and so we're gonna see what happens in the days of Joshua under that new administrator a bad new messenger today meant see God never changed his mind about his work the people were the one that changed my way and so we're gonna read this here real quick almost tell me how one minute no way let's reach out Joshua chapter 5 let's pay attention that is what what what's what's this it says and it came to pass when all the kings of that of the amorite switch were on the side of Jordan West were now this is after the the children of Israel had crossed and Amen to the promised land come on well they were already in the promised land I don't want to get too far in this because I'm there all right and there's so many things tied in to us I'm not good name which were on the side of Jordan westward and all the kings of the Canaanites which were by the sea heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was their spirit in them any more because of the children of Israel so the people around them were scared that's right because God had opened up this river for them and and at that time it was believed it was flooded out of the bus yeah it was flooded and there was no way that people could cross all these all these people could cross and they crossed on dry ground not not not wet ground not muddy ground the Bible says dry a man let's see all right and then verse 2 at that time the Lord said unto Joshua this is after they crossed over me make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time - so here there at the promised land and God said you know they probably felt like we've made it we're here we've crossed over but God said no there's something else you got to do circumcision the second time and Joshua made him sharp knives and circumcise the children of Israel at the heel of the foreskins and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise listen to this all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men aboard died in the wilderness by the way after they came out Egypt thinking about that as a typhoon our day now all the people that came out were circumcised came out of Egypt but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt then they had not circumcised them yet they had a crossed over to the drugs to the promised right for the children of Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness till all the people that were men of war which came out of Egypt were consumed in other words dead because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord unto whom the Lord swear swear up that he would not show them the land including Moses which the Lord swear unto their fathers that he would give us a land that floweth with milk and honey and their children whom he raised up in their stead damn Joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcise them by the way and it came to pass when they had done circumcise and all the people that they avoid in their places in the camp till they were whole and the Lord said unto Joshua this day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off of you wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal on may this day now I don't want to get too much into detail with this but I want to talk about this on Tuesday Lord will and glad you can see that even under this new administration God had not changed his mind about the word of Noah bodies more than he had given to Abraham and hundreds of years before that same thing with Moses and here comes this new messenger dr. Joshua was Joshua types the Holy Spirit in our thing God has not changed his mind about physical circumcision at that time and neither has the Holy Spirit changed his mind about spiritual circumcision in our day that's right amen and so though people had to be willing to be able to be circumcised by Joshua these children on the Joshua could just okay God said God said the circumcised but the people had to receive and believe that God had spoke to Joshua and Stephen accept that and they offer themselves as a sacrifice and I win baby now they were waiting when a year ago absolutely now you also think about Abraham and Abraham was God told Abraham to circumcise himself and he was 99 years old all right think about it brother that's it I should go up and you know what happened they walk new after you're circumcised you won't get absolutely no that but it is the foreskin and said you're a bloody husband - she wasn't talking British either yeah I think she was willing more to practice that more than Moses was enough time because most of us that was in such a hurry I've got to go free the people from the Lord that's right and he forgetting that the word of the Lord was still that was still part of the word of Lord a man so a man well it's just good let's go out we'll continue this next text on the girl
