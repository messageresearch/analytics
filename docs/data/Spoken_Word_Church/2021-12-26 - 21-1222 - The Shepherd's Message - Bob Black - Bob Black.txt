lord jesus christ amen amen so luke chapter 2 if they could pull that up in the back there's there's not too much to pull up tonight they're just taking it taking it easy appreciate uh i guess richard and abby back there doing that preach appreciate them for helping out tonight while we're short-handed yes um so a little bit a little bit of a lengthy reading tonight um but uh we'll read to about the 20th verse and it says um and it came to pass in those days that they went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own city and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david to be taxed with mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end and they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds but mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now you there's a lot of things packed into that that scripture that we just read and let's just kind of take our time tonight as we navigate this and kind of think about it imagine in your head all the circumstances that took place and and uh we sure appreciated that skit on sunday i i was you know kind of sharing uh you know it's interesting how many how many things are brought out with a little skit and just uh just uh makes you makes you think about the circumstances that happened and and um you know you also begin to think too about how there's so many different gifts that are set in the church i i certainly couldn't if i tried to put together a skit like that i certainly couldn't do you know put together all the pieces with all the clothes and everything so it's certainly amazing to see everything come together in a way like that but you know you start thinking about all the things that went into the into this event that that happened and all the the scriptures that were fulfilled and all of the things that were happening as part of this began to unfold like for example they they came to bethlehem and brother adam explained how that bethlehem is the house of god's bread it's where jesus had to be born in bethlehem and that's where every believer is born because we're born from the word he was born in bethlehem because that's that's that's that's where that's that's where the word that comes from and type the the word is coming the house of god's bread were actually born from the word and so he had to go he had to return all of these things it looked like a a a a kind of a a rough spot that they were in where they they had they had to go navigating back to bethlehem when she was mary was pregnant and all the things that began to unfold and then then jesus was born there and and she went mary went into labor and all that circumstance of not being able to find a place to to to stay no room in the end and so forth and look and and she gave birth to the little jesus they're laying in a manger emmanuel laying in a manger and then you would think that you know the angels maybe kind of imagined in your mind the angels will we we got to tell somebody about this somebody's got to know here they are in this little spot in a in the end that nobody knows about nobody knew about the birth of jesus somebody's got to know about this and brother branham explained and why it had to be shepherds he explained that that that you they they bypassed they bypassed all the great cathedrals and all the people that had all the pharisees and caiaphas in his in his great big house where he was sleeping or wherever all that was bypassed to go to little shepherds what a strange thing to think that that the angels would bypass all of the people that were taught with all the religious they had all the training and all the background of what where they of of who the messiah would be they thought and where he would come but it was bypassed to go to little shepherds and brotherhood said why was this great event revealed to shepherds that would be kind of an astounding thing for us you think tonight what a great gift we've got in the message of the hour because there's a lot of people in the world that would that ponder over questions like this but we've got the answer we've got the answer to questions that the religious world can't even begin to grope at we've got the answer because god has spoken to us in this last days and that's why i believe that when you when you begin to dig into the message it quick and quickly elevates your understanding far beyond just like far beyond anything that the religious world can can probe at just like when these angels visited these little shepherds it elevated their understanding get elevated them to a place where they recognize that god had been manifested in flesh in their day and the angels told him how to find him and where to go to find him a shepherd a shepherd a little stinky shepherd a stinky shepherd that everybody would overlook nobody would nobody would nobody would think a shepherd that didn't have any experience speaking a shepherd how would you get some say shepherd we want you to give you give a message why would you expect a shepherd a little stinky shepherd to get up behind the pulpit and deliver a sermon that don't know how to speak or how to talk or how to do anything but a shepherd was the one that the angels came and gave this message to now what is a shepherd a shepherd is somebody that tends to sheep that watches over a sheep and so they understand what the sheep need and they know about them and they know they can they can tell the difference between a sheep and a goat and they can tell the difference between their sheep and somebody else's and the shepherds a shepherd's job is to guide or direct those sheep that don't know what they're they they need somebody to guide them and the shepherd's job job is to guide or direct in a particular direction so a shepherd somebody who watches over or looks after a guise that you begin to begin to ponder in your mind tonight why did it have to be shepherds why did god come down and give shepherds shepherds a message shepherd's a message to take and deliver to people all around that that this man the one that they had been looking for now now he was on earth a shepherd is somebody that's got to move sheep from one place to another move sheep from move sheep from from a place where we'll say it like this where they ain't saved to a place where they're born again a place from they're born again up to virtue and knowledge moving and moving and moving them a ship because a shepherd we'll put it we'll put it now a new testament shepherd somebody that's going to preach the word somebody that's going to preach so that it moves you in the right direction a shepherd somebody that can get out of the way so that god can begin to speak to you so that god can quicken something in your life and change you where you begin to you begin to bear war and you know you ain't even thinking about it you're not even trying to do it you're just doing what god wants you to do that's what a real shepherd is why was it revealed to shepherds brother i'm saying not to the theologians of that day he said they were the ones that the world that the theologians of the day were trained to hear it but they were bypassed he said jesus the son of david is born in bethlehem right under the shadows of the great cathedrals then if those people are trained and had been looking for the messiah for all these years four thousand years the messiah had been prophesied to come and then if the messiah be born in the shadow of the cathedral why do they have to go plumb back up into the mountains to a bunch of unlearned untrained shepherds to bring the great message the first message you think about how blessed we are to have heard a message that god bypassed all the great uh all the great cathedrals and all the denominations of the world it came down to a bunch of rotten stinking people that didn't deserve nothing and god forth something into your heart when you you were just you were just like a little stinking shepherd out there in the field that didn't know nothing about god or nothing about religion but god came down and spoke something into your heart that's why mr shepherds because shepherds would receive it shepherds the shepherds in their humility and their loneliness were the ones that would receive it they would say god i believe your word he said why do the angels go to shepherds to bring the message and he said to bring the great message the first message and he said and commission shippers you think about that those shepherds were commissioned they had a commission from god he said not the wise and untrained but shepherd is strange isn't it the messiah was right in the midst of the religious world the messiah was right in the middle of the religious world and the world failed to recognize it he said why didn't they go out on the hills of judea to unlearned untrained uncultured poorest of all look like the most unfit person for such a task to reveal the message and send them out to bring the message to take a bunch a group of people that were unfit they could not speak they could not preach and send them out to commission them and send them out to to tell the world that that christ was on the scene and he he brought he he brought to our attention that history repeats itself you say you you say well i but if i live back in that day then i would act different no you're you would you would if you're not interested in the word you would not be interested in the word then if you're interested in the word now you would be interested in the word then if there's something hungry in you now for the word there would be something back there hungry and i know i know there's got to be something real that would be your cry back then you see that and history repeats itself today the world is looking for christ manifested in the flesh and they're failing to recognize that despite the fact that god had called little meek lowly shepherds to proclaim that christ is here he said he knew they wouldn't receive such a message the way it come it wasn't in the taste of their learning it was different it wasn't what they had been trained to believe he would be like it was contrary to their theological understanding he knew that they wouldn't receive a message oh you you realize if you can just get away of all of your all of your we we think we're so great sometimes and we we we've got all this baggage of the thing the wrong things that we've been taught but if we can come in loneliness and humility like those shepherds did and just received the message of the angel [Music] he said the messiah was here so the messiah was here and there must be somebody recognize it there's got to be somebody recognizing what was the shepherd what was the shepherd's message the shepherd's message was messiah's here where was he he was now there in flesh and where is he today where is the messiah today he's now here in flesh that's why you know we were preaching on the rapture a few a few nights ago and you there's first got to come a shout but then there's got to come a voice what does the voice declare the voice declares that he's here for the angels the angel declared to the shepherds that i'll tell you where he is and they had to go see it and they had to go find it out but when they saw it then they could declare he's here the one that we've been looking for and they've been going to go down the streets and tell everybody he's here as the majority awaken making their way over to for two years that two getting a mage our covenant and the shepherds were going around telling everybody i know where you can find this messiah now brother brown said the shepherd was the most illiterate of anybody he didn't need to know nothing but just about his sheep he didn't need to know mathematics he didn't need to know how to split an atom he didn't need no scholarship you think about all the things that moses knew and then he had to unlearn because listen if you're going to be a shepherd it's not about how much you know by the intellectual world but how much you know about life how much you know about god how much you know about the one that can make put life into a little greater blast that we grasp that we walk on it doesn't matter how much you know about how whether you can how to split an atom or molecules and all how to put a spaceship in the space if you don't understand life that if you plant a seed into the ground it's going to come up and and then it'll die and go back into the ground and it'll come up again there's a cycle of life life of this is the thing we got to know about he said a shepherd a shepherd didn't need no scholarship he had just he just had to know his sheep that's all he needed to know a chef she a shepherd knows a sheep knowing the sheep what does that mean how do you call sheep a shepherd knows how to call sheep a shepherd knows how you get a sheep to come a shepherd knows how to get a sheep to surrender his life a shepherd knows what will help the sheep a shepherd knows what what a sheep needs to eat a shepherd knows what's best for the sheep a shepherd is there to watch over the sheet and guard them from the enemy because a shepherd knows what the enemy looks like because a shepherd can tell a goat from the sheep he can tell a wolf and sheep's clothing from their sheep a shepherd is going to watch out for things a shepherd knows what's the best way to protect the sheep a shepherd knows how to lay down in the door of the sheepfold and when all the sheep get in he can't nothing can hit in and the sheep can't get out because the sheep knows the shepherd knows the sheep a shepherd knows how a sheep is born a shepherd knows how to deliver a little baby sheep and a shepherd knows how to make a sheep grow a shepherd knows how to make a sheep come to a place where they can buy a wall come to a place where they can do what a sheep is supposed to do that's what a shepherd does because he knows the sheep and brother i'm saying god the great wisdom and the fountain and resource of all wisdom would choose such a person as that such a person in loneliness and humility a meek little shepherd somebody that all they knew about was sheep that didn't have a great big intellectual understanding of education that they didn't have all these lld's and everything but yet they knew god and they wanted god more than all else and he said and bypass all the well-trained scholars that's trained to know that he said would choose a person such as that and then he corrected it persons persons rather as that persons why persons because there's persons that are going to take this message of malachi 4 gonna take what's been preached and they're going to preach it it's got to be prophesied again there's persons that are going to preach this message he said notice the highest heavens hastening to honor earth's most humble and unlearned the highest of heaven came down to make itself known to the lowest of the earth bypassing all between to make itself known to common herdsmen coming to give these common herdsmen the greatest message of all times and we've got the greatest we we've got something to preach i believe we've got a message that we can pre we've got they had a message that they can preach at luther's day and they got a message that they can preach in wesley's day but what about now we've got a message that now we can preach that the messiah is here he's come back in flesh he's a man he's moving in his people he's using your hands and using your feet and he's being identified in your midst how do you know he's here by the bible because i know whatever his word is whatever his word is believed he's there in the midst he promised that where the two and the three would be gathered in his name and if you're gathered tonight in his name he's here moving among you that's the promise of his word it doesn't matter if i don't feel it it doesn't matter if i don't see the pillar of fire yet i know because i can i believe his word and i believe if he's spoken he's got to make it come to pass brotherhood setting god hiding himself and simplicity today we're so scientific till we can tell how many molecules it takes to make an atom how many electrons and so forth and split that atom and tell you how it's done make an atomic bomb and then we can explain how we've done it but walk over a blade of grass that we cannot explain it's in simplicity that god reveals himself in the simplicity of a little shepherd's heart a little shepherd on the side of a mountain that don't know nothing about nothing but yet he knows about god he wants to know about god he said don't ever try to educate yourself to god when you do you educate yourself away from god see god is not known by education god is known by faith and the first stroke that the devil took was on the educational program and man lost his fellowship with god he must know god by faith not what he can explain by what he believes that he can't explain that we just vice verse of the picture you don't know you don't find god by going to the doctor and saying well well he said i'm gonna get sick you don't know god by trying to be instructed in it but you know god by a spiritual revelation but god comes down and makes the word alive in your heart then you're living by faith and he said here he comes with the greatest of all the messages what was the message what was the shepherd's message he said it here and what was it what why why did why did it come to shepherds messiah is here now messiah is here now and to make that known he bypassed all the train to make it known to humble shepherds he said the shepherds now was the one who received the message and now noticed where the message was and the most unlikely place that anyone would expect it to come the most unlikely place everything about this story was unlikely the place where jesus was born was unlikely everybody was expecting him to come to the great big cathedrals and synagogues and to the great big mighty men of renowned of the religious day to the caiaphas and and the gamaliels and all those they would exp everybody would expect the angels to deliver their message to the great people but he came down to the little humble the little lowly now notice where the message was and i wondered tonight if we were looking for the true message of the lord jesus i wonder if it would be an unlikely group a unlikely group that that knows their god that unlikely group that the world is overlooked a little unlike a group that's not afraid to praise god and and raise their hands in worship and and and cry a little bit and shout and because that they know god an unlike likely group that the world would look at and say well well i don't want to be like that an unlikely group that's been born of real birth had a real word but not just some dried up birth but they've been born again by the word they got down in the mud and mire or whatever it took to be born again that's a little unlikely group like the shepherds on that mountainside maybe in a rain storm maybe in a hail storm whatever it was overlooked by the world and their loneliness and meekness he said i wonder if that wouldn't be where we'd find him the most unlikely place into the most unqualified speakers the most unqualified speakers shepherds didn't know nothing about speaking he said shepherds didn't know nothing about speaking i think i think in the message of the hour we've got some of the greatest speakers the world has ever known was through stammering lips and stuttering tongues and all this they can't hardly get their words out sometimes but yet they're delivering a message with the greatest message that the world has ever known that christ is here shepherds know nothing about speaking only calling sheep that's all a shepherd knows about us how to get a sheep into the kingdom how to get a sheep up to the altar how to get a sheep to a place where they're not afraid to raise their hands and crowd to god and say i know i need something from you a shepherd knows how to call sheep he said well maybe that's why i come in john chapter 10 jesus answered him and said i told you and you believe not the works that i do in my father's name they wear witness of me but you believe not because you are not of my sheep because you are not of my seat sheep as i said unto you my sheep my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and you know that's what a shepherd knows a shepherd knows that if he can get out of the way and deliver the word of god to the people it'll call sheep a shepherd knows that the sheep will respond to the voice of god and what is the voice of god in this day the voice of god is the same word that the prophet preached because what the prophet preached is the same word that paul preached and what paul preached is the same word that the son of man preached and if we're preaching the same word that the son of man preached that's the voice of god the voice of god is being preached my sheep will hear my voice and i know them and they follow me how do you know but why does he know them because a shepherd knows as sheep a shepherd can tell a sheep from a goat and a shepherd knows what a sheep wants a shepherd knows what a sheep will feed on a shepherd knows everything about what is what will cause a sheep to prosper brotherhood said there was a promised word he said the wisdom the infinite wisdom of almighty god did it to make known to them the greatest message ever was the messiah is now on earth and god takes the nothings the nothings to do something with he takes the nothingness to do something with you you ever notice how that john it's look like he just comes out of the wilderness and nothing come out of the wilderness didn't have any his mama and daddy were passed on and he come out of the wilderness eating eating uh eating bugs and honey and and everybody would look at him well you're nothing but yeah he had the greatest message his message was i'm going to identify to you where the son of man is i'm going to point the way to him you think about all elijah and i think with first or second kings chapter 17 when he first appears on the scene where did he come from nothing and nobody that nobody didn't even knows where his ancestry was but he came on the scene why he because god takes the nothings and he does something weird and he came out of the scene declared in the word of the lord he came out of nowhere from nothing brother said the religious world was trained to believe his word and then when his word was vindicated before their very eyes they denied the word that was made vindication think of what taken place think of what caused them their training caused them not to recognize the very word made flesh for their day the very training that they had in their schools with the very best of teachers he said man is always praising god now listen to this we've heard this so many times before now listen to what it really means man is always praising god religious man for what he done for what he did back with john the baptist and elijah what he did back with paul and irenaeus and martin columba luther and wesley and always pointing to what he's going to do one of these days one of these days christ is going to be revealed in the flesh one of these days the lord will come the lord himself will descend with a shout and the voice of the archangel and the trump of god one of these days and he said and then ignoring what he's doing so what is the shepherd's message look to what he's doing right now he's doing something right now he's revealing his word in flesh right now brother brown said can you see can you see what god is doing now can you see what he's doing right now he said they did not recognize him because it didn't fit their interpretation now all this time as the shepherds were there they were here in the the serenade of the angels out there in the field and the mountains all this time as jesus was being born and all these events were taking place the magi had seen a star and they were journeying over from the from the east all the way from india or iran or or wherever it was that they were coming from all the way in the east that that had heard they had heard originally heard about things from daniel and have been instructed so they didn't have all the truth but they had enough to know that god was going to be manifested in flesh one day and they went on a journey and they started coming for two years traveling traveling and all this time the message was being preached a message was being preached by these little shepherds brother adam said did you know there's not a speck of history says that any of them seen that star at all why it wasn't given to them they wasn't looking for such so it was a supernatural star that these magi are looking at but these wise men know that there will be a star of jacob rise that's the prophecy of balaam believe it or not that there will be a star of jacob rise and they were looking for because because they could read daniel had pointed them to balaam's prophecy and said look look at that right there he's coming and they were believing in that and trusting that and he said the star led them to the religious capital of the world the star led them not to bethlehem not to bethlehem but it led them to jerusalem and when they got to jerusalem when they got to jerusalem then they the star didn't lead them any further then they had they needed a man to tell them they needed somebody they needed somebody that god could speak through i i'm i'm putting it like that now and as soon he said as soon as they entered those gates to jerusalem that star the supernatural that had led them refused to show them anymore they got to jerusalem the religious capital of the world where you would think that with all the cathedrals and all the synagogues somebody would know where to find christ manifested in the flesh and brother brown said after two years of traveling after two years of the shepherd's ministry nobody knew where to find jesus the angels had told the shepherds take this message and go around tell everybody where he where you can find him the shepherds knew the shepherds knew where to find him but the whole world the whole religious world had overlooked it he said up and down the streets these fine man rich man with fine draped camels and so forth up and down the street saying where is he that's born king of the jews we saw his star in the east what a what a sight to see all these men with their camel trees and their turbans and their fine garments and all their all their bodyguards and all their entourage going down the street saying we know he's got to be here somewhere surely somebody knows how to find him and that great religious capital brotherhood said after two years after two years of the shepherd's message still didn't have the answer oh no nothing about it still didn't have the answer after two years of the shepherd why why did they not have the answer because they could not believe that the little poor little humble little group of shepherds would have the answer that all their synagogues and all their cathedrals and all their denominational ideas could not even begin to prohibit they could not fathom that a little poor little group of people would have the answer he said the head of all the denominations didn't have the answer what an honor how fitting it is to a shepherd to receive a message of a newborn sheep it could come to nothing else but a shepherd i believe tonight that we've got the answer that the world is groping for and that's why the gospel has got to be preached it first must be preached in all the world and then he can come it's got to be preached and what's going to be preached the same thing that the shepherds preached to the little shepherd's message that christ is here what you're looking for is here he said in this state the shepherds was in then in their stable with their lamb a vindicated message that they had heard how beautiful and the presence of the messiah a vindicated word of their message when the shepherds heard that the messiah was on earth and came into his presence right in their own environment right in an environment that they were comfortable with a shepherd ain't going to be comfortable with a and a with all this stained glass and and and and spooky singing with a choir that echoes bounces back and forth off the walls and an incense swinging on a big long pole or something all that a shepherd ain't gonna be comfortable with all that but you give a shepherd the word in an environment where people are comfortable with praising god and coming to the altar and springing out of their seat and singing songs of worship that's where a shepherd is comfortable a shepherd is comfortable in a little manger a shepherd is comfortable in a place where where he he's comfortable with the sheep why because he can he wants to lay his head down on the sheep and get that lantern all over him and get get all get all up in the in the sheep and just get get get familiar with the sheep get familiar with the word get familiar with god get him into a love relationship with god the word and he said they they found the message to be true it was vindicated there how that must have made those man feel to find that god had done this great thing for them to bypass all the world all the intellectual giants and reveal to little people that didn't deserve nothing amen how that should make us feel that he's been born in the manger of our heart the manger of our stinking rotten little heart just like he was born in the main in that manger there where the animals were over to the side making their fertilizer and doing all kind of maybe there was a little a little puddle of urine over to the side and it was just a stinking mess but yet that's what god wanted to be born and he wanted to be born in your heart he wanted to change your heart despite all of your past and despite all of your history he come down and somebody that was humble and low and meek and that's where he wanted to make his home he said some of these herds might not might not have even been able to sign their own name you think about that think about peter peter but jesus said simon loves now me more than these and he said feed my lambs why did he say that because he knew he was a shepherd a little man that that all he knew how to do was fish and all he wanted to do was just serve god and one day he told found a man that said feed my lambs feed my lambs and he told him that three times do you love me well yes lord i know you know i love you and he kept telling him feed my sheep feed my sheep why because he found a real shepherd he found a real shepherd that could preach the statue of a perfect man he found a real shepherd that one day he'd be able to preach preach open the door to the baptism of the holy ghost to those on the day of pentecost he found a shepherd that knew how to call sheep lovers thou mean more than these he saith unto him feed my limbs yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my sheep and lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee jesus saith unto him feed my sheep feed my sheep because peter was a preacher he found him a good preacher and that's what preachers do preachers feed the sheep features are the ones god i believe god is still choosing shepherds god wants to find somebody that'll preach his word somebody that'll get out to get out of the way and knows what god wants done with the word somebody that'll feel completely at ease in a manger a little stable somebody that'll feel completely at ease with all the little sheep with the sheep praising god he said the shepherds felt completely at ease in that place with god's lamb when a good shepherd over the sheep can see the word of god made plain and vindicated of what he promised to do that shepherds right at home and there they looked and saw what the angel told him manifested right in front of him you know what makes a shepherd feel at home when he sees somebody get their deliverance somebody to get their deliverance from depression he sees the word of god may manifest it right in front of him somebody get a born-again experience somebody begin to testify about what god has done for them somebody begin to shout and praise god because god is real and not dead laying up in a grave somewhere but he's alive that's when a preacher that's when a shepherd feels at home it don't make a shepherd feel at home to get new cars and get gifts piled on them and all these get t-shirts and mugs but what makes a preacher feel at home is when he sees god's word manifested in your life in a sheep's life to see you bear forth war [Applause] and brother brown said let a true shepherd of the word preach it and the power of the resurrection that jesus christ is ashamed same yesterday today and forever peter said on the day of pentecost the promises unto you and to your children unto them that's a far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and whoever he calls the promise and the same blessing is true that promise will be made manifest because god's god spoke it he promised it and when you see that come to pass that's where we feel at ease he said let a genuine word feeding shepherd see that vindicated all the theologians in the world can't take it away from him because he know god said so when it happens it's just god's word always his word was made flesh and was dwelling among them and they knew it not poor humble shepherds that had no education with a message poor almost shepherds with a message and what was their message i can prove it to you this is the baby this is the messenger i can prove it to you why because i've had an experience i was there i went where the angel told me to i followed his direction and i was there i saw him with my own eyes i experienced it that's what the shepherd's message is he said here they had the evidence and after the evidence go up there the stable and see if that baby isn't laying there that's that's why we come to church we enter into the sanctuary of the lord so with all the other believers present bringing our little licks of fire together to prove to the unbeliever that comes into the house of god this this baby is real this child is real to prove to the make believer that there's something real about this gospel you see why it's not just the preacher in the in the in the church but everybody is involved the people are pulling and amen because we're all involved the people are praising god because they're believing it the people are saying amen because that's the hebrew word in mana which means faith and when you say amen that means i believe it we're all in one in one accord believing together because the proof is here the proof that the baby is is laying there and he said it's so simple that's how the wise always overlooks it it's so simple it confounds them they look for a god way out there when he's right here they're looking for something way on there when it's right here with them now christ risen from the dead the same yesterday today and forever the shepherds were praising god with a message he said they were shepherds they know sheep a shepherd was the only thing would accept a lamb i'm going to take this coat off if y'all don't mind a shepherd was the only thing would accept the lamb they were the only kind that would accept it they were the only kind that would look there that little baby laying there and say yep that's the word that's the one that we've been looking for and they know how to take care of it they knew what to do with it and so is it today when we get the lamb's message when we get the lamb's message we know what it's for we we know what to do with it we know is to birth children of god into the kingdom we know it's got to be preached it's not to be said at home with and on sunday morning when everybody else is at church and and we just sit at home and don't come to church it's it's got to be preached you got to you got to get your lick of fire around other believers we got to get together he said here was humble shepherds in a stable adoring emmanuel god himself made flesh and laying in a stable and after they had adorned him adored him and realized that the message that they had been preaching was vindicated they were out praising god with the most incredible message of an angel now you think about that when they heard when they realized that it was vindicated they began to praise god they didn't just sit there like like brother branham would use the expression like a bump on a pickle they didn't just sit there but they began to praise god they began to something something was taking place in their lives you see anybody that's been delivered of something they don't just sit well i guess i've been delivered from depression no they something has taken place well i guess i guess god finally did save me no there's there's a praise going on there's a singing going on [Applause] they said a shepherd that couldn't write his name smelling like a sheep pen walking down the street hollering glory to god in the highest we know that he's on earth walking down the street smelling like a sheep pen and he said listen the first time the first time that they were out there on the field and the angels came to to to tell them about the message and the angels began to sing a song and he talks about the first time that angels had a celebration it was in heaven when they talked to when they told joe remember job where was you before i laid the foundation of the earth god talking to job when the morning star sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy now that was he said that was the first time ever angels ever sing a celebration what was in heaven but now they had come to earth to sing a celebration the first time they ever sang on earth was to shepherds in luke chapter 2 the one we were just reading glory to god in the highest on earth peace good will toward men because whenever there's a birth whenever a king is born there's always singing in other words there's always going to be praising when when he was born and you did you didn't something happen you didn't something within you oh oh god something's taken place you didn't just sit there and well oh well but some there was life in you and whenever there's a bird when there was a birth of this king that was singing the shepherds couldn't contain themselves and they went through the streets saying glory to god and the angels were shouting and when something takes place in your life you cannot contain why why were they why was there singing because there was a new creation a new create what kind of a creation god putting himself in mortal flesh tabernacling himself in you tabernacling himself in the in the in the flesh of a little baby they're laying in a manger he said god was fixing to make another creation he created moral earth mortal life angels sing in heaven but here he's creating a new life eternal life for man and he's singing to his subjects through angels on the earth not in heaven he said there's got to be singing kings wouldn't have been saying king is what kings have been saying to he said the people wouldn't have sang to him because they didn't believe him that people wouldn't have sang to him because they didn't believe him but shepherds would and the angels did why why did they sing because they believed and he said now brother brown laid it out so i'm just repeating what he said he said here it comes you might as well get it he said that's the reason today that people's ashamed to praise god they're ashamed of christ their shame now see if they believed god and were were not not ashamed to raise their hand not ashamed to raise their hand in the middle of service or even in singing when you when you don't when a song is being sung does it touch your heart and you can't lift your hand up because i'm ashamed of what other people are going to think now on the day of pentecost they weren't ashamed oh the day of pentecost they went where they went down and they were they were telling everybody this is that i'm going to tell you i know where the baby is let's say like i know where the baby is in the manger i've been there i've experienced something and they weren't ashamed now he said if you believe if you believe you're not ashamed to pray now i i can tell by the expressions on your face this is a little bit rough because do you believe do you believe god enough to not be ashamed that when something takes place that you that you that you you you you'll do something something takes place he said god's gonna find somebody somebody that he can get praised through he's gonna find somebody that believes him enough can come to a place when they're believing where they ain't ashamed anymore yeah maybe tonight we're where maybe we're in a place where we'll well we believe but we we just kind of hadn't quite broke through that place where we're we believe enough to where we're not ashamed the way we believe enough to where we don't care what somebody else thinks i i think maybe maybe you know you see a lot of the young people they'll go to camp and they'll get real enthused about the message and they'll be like i've had a real experience but they come back to the church and and they hadn't broke through enough to say amen in church you see god wants you to be able to break through enough to where you ain't ashamed that where you can say amen or you can praise god a little bit maybe maybe what we need is for the young people to break through enough to where the old people can see that something's taken place maybe young people can be an example to the old people and praise god a little bit lift up your hands and praise like the shepherds did and say something's happened to me something happened to me at camp something happened to me in my prayer closet something happened to me that night beside my bed when something god came down and entered into my soul and quickened the word that i heard something happened to me and i'm not ashamed of it anymore i know that god is real i can point you to the place where he was born i can point you to the manger where he lays and i know he's there and not be ashamed in luke chapter 19 it says when he was come now now even now the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest throwing their palm palm leaves in front of jesus as he rode in and they knew who he was and so they could not contain they began to praise god because they believed him they believed who he was and and some of the pharisees from among the multitudes said unto him master rebuked thy disciples we we're uncomfortable with all this noise we're uncomfortable with all this praise we're uncomfortable in a little stinky manger where people are believing where their sheep are we're uncomfortable with all these sheep around you praising and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if they should hold their peace the stones would cry out somebody's gonna believe god and somebody's gonna praise him and in that moment if somebody had not praised god then the rocks would have cried out maybe tonight you're a rock there's somebody somebody's got to praise god and you say well brother brother bob tonight maybe you're trying to drum up the people maybe you're trying to stir something up maybe i'm trying to preach the word maybe i'm saying exactly what the prophet said brother brown said his subjects must sing to him his subjects have to sing to him what are you singing back to god you're singing back his praises because god has done something in your life god has done something if god has really done something in your life you're not ashamed to tell the world you're not ashamed to stand up and praise god you're not ashamed to say something loud you're not ashamed to say amen in church if god has done something for you brother bob that's too strong that hurts my feelings well sometimes the word sometimes the word because the word is shaping you it's molding into you what god wants you to be and god wants you to be a bold lion of the tribe of judah he wants you to be bold with the message he wants you to not care what the devil thinks see about you he wants you to not care about what your co-workers think about you he won't if we if we care about what other believers think about us what what where are we we should be so comfortable in the house of god he said his subjects must sing to him and his subjects then was his angels and they sang to his shepherds which was to take his message throughout all scriptures the message of redemption has been given by shepherds and through sheep now that's a quote to take home with you throughout all sacred scriptures the message of redemption has been given by shepherds and through sheep well brother bob i think that we should just take the message and we should just go home with us with it and we should just not go to church anymore but we should just play the tapes at home and we should not believe in shepherds anymore we should not believe in preachers anymore we should not come together with fellowship anymore but yet this is a quote from brother branham that there are going to be shepherds because it is a scriptural type it's a scripture it runs all through the word and he said throughout all sacred scriptures the message of redemption has been given by shepherds and through sheep the reason people don't like shepherds and don't have stopped coming to church and stop listening to preachers because it hurts their feelings like what i was just preaching a few moments ago sometimes the preaching of the gospel hurts your feelings and when the preaching of the gospel hurts your feelings that don't mean to go home and stop going to church and and we'll just do it the easy way we'll just press play when we get home but you a real sheep a real sheep is going to want to be molded into the image of its creator a real sheep is going to want to look like its shepherd and that's why god gave us shepherds he said throughout all sacred scriptures the message of redemption has been given by shepherds and through sheep the message always came by sheep because from the very beginning it was through sheep and by shepherds that he revealed himself all was shadows and types now you go all the way back to the very beginning the very first message will say that brother said the first message that was ever heard there in the garden after adam and eve had done what they did there they were god came down and killed to kill the lamb and clothed them with with the garments of the lamb skin and and then he preached a message where did he preach that he said he preached that message over the top of a dead sheepskin from the very beginning over the top of a dead sheepskin now follow me as we kind of type this he said over the top of a dead sheepskin that god had slew and wrapped adam and eve in it the first message to a condemned generation was over the top of sheepskin think about that you picture that god preaching a sermon in the garden and he said and the lord said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou are cursed above all cattle above every beast of the field upon thy ability that thou shalt go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life preaching that sermon over sheep's king and he said i'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel he's preaching a sermon that one day there's going to come a lamb to come and he was preaching that about that lamb over sheepskin he said the prophets of the old testament drape themselves in sheepskin signifying their faith that sheep because why that sheep that shepherd was guiding all the old testament saints all the new testament saints all is guiding continuously looking forward is signifying their faith in his word of the coming perfect lamb we we're following we're following the great shepherd who's leading and guiding us somewhere and they wore sheepskins in the old testament because the word that they preached was was looking forward one day one day there's coming one that's going to save the world from their sins if they can believe and that's why the gospel was preached over sheepskins elijah and john and elisha and all those prophets with wrapped up in sheepskin he said the the word of god came to them over the top of sheepskins abraham was a herdsman isaac was a husband little shepherds jacob was a herdsman moses was a herdsman david was a herdsman all of god's representatives usually were herdsmen little shepherds wrapped up in sheepskin preaching the word of god and their message was leading them to christ they didn't know they could it was way far off but yet the word that they were preaching was leading them to christ as they were wrapped up in sheepskin and he said now now we're going to find out why it come to shepherds why i had to be shepherds they knew the sheep is helpless without the shepherd to guide them brother bob i don't like that i want to be on my own i don't want to go to church i just want to sit at home and listen to tapes and things he said a sheep is perfectly helpless and he cannot go by himself aren't you glad that you have shippers together if when you've got a rough you've got a rough question you can go to somebody and and ask them a question i battled with this i battled with this question i battled with this problem how do i get rid of this problem in my life and you can go to a shepherd that you have confidence in and say where is it in the word where is it in the word where show me where it is and he said that's the reason god likened his believing children under sheep they got to be guided they gotta be guided he said but watch what's guiding you don't get a goat he'll walk you to the slaughter pen god never give us a goat he gave us his son the holy spirit to guide us we're not guided by you know it's it's real fashionable for the young people today to have those hats and the t-shirts and things that say go to crosstalk i don't like that because think about what that symbolizes still a believer a goat greatest of all time goat now now even that doesn't make any sense why why do we want to elevate ourselves to whether we're the greatest of all time or to say that somebody one of our superstars or whatever is the greatest of all time i wear a hat that says goat on it why would i want to be identified with a goat that's lead that's separated away from the sheep we're not goats we're sheep he said god never give us a goat he gave us his son the holy spirit to guide us he is a god not some man-made herdsmen with man-made ideas that's following the ideas of a denominational leadership or some something that somebody conjured up he said but a god-given herdsmen who feed the sheep upon sheep food why because a shepherd a shepherd knows what sheep need a sheep need sheet food he said isn't it strange that god likened us to sheep a sheep is the most helpless thing there is there's nothing so insufficient of defense than the sheep a rabbit can run a squirrel can get in a tree a dog can bite a lion can tear a horse can kick a bird can fly but a sheep stands helpless a sheep has no natural defenses and he said that's the way god wants us to realize that we're totally insufficient we need we need some help when you come into the house of god and realize you need some help then you're getting somewhere when you realize that there's something lacking in your life and you're you're getting somewhere like that ethiopian eunuch sitting there in his chair and he was pouring through the scriptures and he was he was reading and he said i don't know i don't know what this is i don't know what i'm reading about what what is this and it was the spirit of god that told philip that see we're not following the leadership of men it's the leadership of the holy ghost and that's where people get all trapped up they think well we're not we're this this sermon brother bob is about the great shepherd it is about the great shepherd the great shepherd moving in his people and the great shepherd moved in philip and said go join yourself to that chariot that that man needs some help he needs some holy spirit guidance and that holy spirit guidance was in a man named philip then the spirit said unto philip go near and join thyself to this chariot and philip ran his thinner to him and heard him read the prophet isaiah and said understand us thou with thou readest and he said how can i except some man should guide me but it wasn't a man it was supernatural revelation that god had given to philip that was guiding him you see you see how how dangerous it is to preach this almost we're not following the leadership of a man when you put your confidence in your pastor you put your confidence in the elders of the church you're not putting your confidence in a man you're putting your confidence in the holy spirit leadership and the holy spirit moving in the church the holy ghost is what's leading us our confidence is not even in brother branham the man our confidence is that god came down and used that man as a mouthpiece to speak to him words that echo on even today even though that man is now in the grave our confidence is not in a man but our confidence isn't a god that can use a man as a mouthpiece and speak through him speak to you so that you can get your need answered you know that's why sometimes when the young people go to camps and things or they're in in services i remember zach telling me this one year after he got back from a camp he said dad every question that i had was answered why because that wasn't a man behind the pulpit it was god speaking through that man to speak to his need to speak to to answer every problem that he had it's the holy ghost in the church the sheep have got to be fed brother abraham said you know there's a lot of sheep food and there's a lot of food you give your sheep would kill it and i'm so glad that god was mindful enough of his sheep to get the right kind of shepherd the lord jesus to give us the word of god what a pity it is today that they try to feed sheep slop but a sheep won't eat it why i'm trying to i'm trying to hurry through some of my notes here he said why why will a sheep not eat sloth because a sheep knows his voice the voice of the shepherd now now to just kind of skip over some things you think about how think about the beauty and the poetry of this that the way that we know that we're hearing the truth is because we can recognize the voice of god when you're sitting in church if it if it dovetails with the scripture you know that you're hearing from god and the way that god knows his sheep is also by your voice the way that he you know him as his by his voice and the way that you he knows you is by your voice let me skip through all these things i'm trying to find that so i can read it to you he said the shepherd knows his sheep back in 1954 brother adam was preaching in questions and answers he said anybody in here ever hear a goat cry and and we'll be closing in just a minute he said brother you better be a shepherd if you want to know the difference the difference between a sheep and a goat how do you tell the difference because a shepherd can tell that the voice they can tell the difference between the voice now now people have told me before well a goat will say ma and a sheep will say ba i don't i don't know if i can't tell the difference it sounds the same to me both sounds like bad and brother ryan said a goat will cry just exactly like a sheep uh-huh he said let a little old billy goat get hung up out there somewhere and a little sheep on one side going by and then buy just the same buy and buy how are you going to tell the difference but a shepherd can the great shepherd can tell the difference and he said now listen to this he said i've heard them down at the altar just crying and crying oh god crying away sobbing away like that and he said i goat all the time how can you tell the difference but the shepherd can amen by the voice he said that's right shouting he said i've seen them shout till they just and they run across the floor and jump up and down and shout but that's not it not your emotion but your voice that's how you tell him and how he tells you by you by the voice he said in making the valley full of ditches he said did you ever hear a goat bleep a goat and a sheep's almost the same thing and i've heard goats crying when they act like sheep it takes a real shepherd to know the difference you hear a goat squealing that sounds just exactly like a sheep but a shepherd knows the voice what kind of voice brother bob now i'm not not a voice that is easily interpreted interpreted or impersonated i believe the same kind of voice that when an angel told mary you're going to have a child she answered back be it unto me according to thy word and i believe god was pleased with that he could look at that and say that's that's a sheep right there i believe when brother brown was sitting on the other side of that wall there and hattie wright was listening to that through that through that wall and she she heard brother around testifying about that that squirrel and she was sitting over there and she said brother brown that's nothing but the truth i believe god was pleased with that he was so pleased that he said you tell her whatever she says she's gonna get amen why because that's a sheep that's a sheep answering back you see that then it don't matter how much you squall and how much you scream but it's your voice answering back in other words do you believe god do you have a revelation of this message do you know can you do you know where the baby is laying in the manger have you heard the message of the shepherds telling you where you can find this baby and do you know have you listened can you or are you like the people when the magi came and said surely he's got to be around be around here somewhere and you're like i don't know i don't know where to find him maybe he's over there maybe he's maybe he's up there and two states away or whatever and he knows his sheep he can identify as sheep he can identify sheep by their voice and by what they eat in first john chapter 2 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him so if you love the world but you don't love the word if you're not interested in coming to church that shows something's wrong now now now we'll get it we'll get into the closing here we'll close in just a minute but brother brother brown he used moses a type of that great shepherd prophet and he used him as a type with that with that shepherd's staff and he had that shepherd staff and he he's comparing moses a type of the great shepherd prophet he said with that shepherd's staff god made a way talking about a why did it have to be shepherds preaching the word over sheepskin he wrapped up in sheepskin with a shepherd's staff leading the way and that shepherd's staff meant something he made a way he said he never lost to one of them as they went on their journey neither did they go hungry or their clothes didn't even get threadbare moses the shepherd led them those who will follow will never be lost follow the shepherd moses that shepherd prophet had three gifts to prove that he was who he said he was three gifts to vindicate his ministry and calling to the elders of israel and to pharaoh and the first two gifts had something to do with his occupation of the shepherd of fur with with being up even a prophet to the people the first sign was to turn a rod that that that uh that staff into a serpent and the second was to turn his hand into leprosy and the third was to take that water out of the nile river in egypt and turn it into blood but now now brother brown really focused in this message if you go back and listen to it which i encourage you to do go back and listen to how he lays out he's typing these these first two signs that god he said the first two signs had a voice with him a voice of the voice of prophecy he said a voice of of their future the future of the children of israel now the third sign was if you reject that word if you reject it then you're it's turned you it the waters turned to blood it's a sign of death a symbol of death a word rejected those first two things were were telling them in other words it was a god the shepherd leading them telling them leading them to the promised land leading them to the opening of the word and he said watch that pole that shepherd staff he took that shepherd's staff and wrapped the brazen serpent around it and they would anybody that would look at that shepherd's staff would be healed watch that pole watch the serpent watch the red sea as he he held that rock that shepherd staff over the red sea whatever that he did now it was symbolizing something he said he was going to change nature to make it work for them look at that shepherd's goat making a way for them to go the shepherd staff he said by that shepherd staff not a textbook not their not their learning not a theologian's idea but a shepherd's staff a shepherd's rod guiding his sheep making the way clear as they went towards the promised land the shepherd's staff their their god with their fault they were following not the words of a man but they were following the words of god he wrapped a brass serpent around the shepherd's sheep goat in the wilderness and that was speaking of true atonement coming for sickness and sin and then he when he put that shepherd's staff down on the floor and in front of the impersonators and it ate up the other two of the other two staffs and brother brown said that was typing that my word heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never fail so what were they following they were following the word they were following the word as they went on their journey that shepherd staff and now that second sign though he put his hand into his bosom and brother brown said now see this this is i love this type because this gives us something to preach he said he put he put his hand into his bosom his right hand into his bosom he said now there he stands holding his right hand over his heart where the hidden secrets of redemption had been hid since the foundation of the world he put his right hand over his heart there's a secret that god wanted to reveal and he said here's why shepherds jesus is god's right hand this is jesus we all know there's moses portraying him exactly he held the secrets of the father and he showed them to us well notice watch him pull from his bosom his right hand smitten with deadly leprosy that's what happened to christ on the cross he was smitten with he was smitten with every uh just everything was poured out on him because of our sin showed what god would do with his right hand he said how moses was must have felt when he pulled his right hand from over his heart out of his bosom and his hand was smitten with leprosy leprosy symbolizes sin incurable and especially in its last stage and brethren that's where the world was when god pulled his right hand christ from his bosom notice he said it was the prophet shepard that smote himself he's the one that pulled his hand out he took by the commandment of god and put his own hand into his bosom and pulled it out submitting with leprosy he did it himself and christ said i lay my life down no man takes it from me and he pulled and put his hand back in there and pulled it out again and it was it was made clean he said that secret what secret the secret of christ the secret of christ christ in flesh again that secret had been in god's bosom all these years covered by his right hand jesus the secret in the back part of god's mind the secret of god's healing laid in the bosom of jesus christ or god he was on the right hand of god that's the only sheep that held in his bosom the secret he said it came quick and it left quick no sooner the right hand was drawn from the bosom the second time the deadly disease was gone when he drew it the second time and on calvary's cross when he had paid the penalty of sin for us all he said it's finished it didn't take a year it was finished right then that's why isaiah says for he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed because you uh moses playing out that story right there putting his hand into his bosom and bringing it out symbolizing that there's a secret a secret of christ all of these things that are hidden in christ have got to be preached and it was given from christ to us on the day of pentecost to preach that's why it had to be shepherds somebody's got to preach this secret the hidden secret he said the believers whose names were written in the book of life predestinated from the foundation of the world it was finished that very minute that jesus said it was finished and extended it down to you and i in the form of his word the hidden secret of his great heart was revealed by a prophet shepherd it was revealed by a shepherd prophet shepherd now this is when he gets into preaching y'all okay for just a few more minutes i i know i do bad on wednesday night i just preach and preach and i don't mean to wear you out or anything but i i got a message i got a shepherd's message he said no wonder the mountains jumped and shouted on that day no wonder the sun hit its face and screamed its shore talking about calvary he said no wonder all nature broke loose the wind shook the trees until they shook and shook enjoyed and jumped they seen the prophet ship prophet shepherd on the mountain redeem every name on the book of life and they seen that their own nature was redeemed they screamed and jumped and the world went into an earthquake he said like any meeting like any meeting like a meeting like this like a camp meeting like any meeting when the shepherd reveals to you that it's finished and how how is he going to do that but if the word is not preached the word has got to be preached and when the word is preached that is finished for you a word of deliverance is preached for you then it's finished and then the earth will shake you'll jump and and all these things that he just outlined just like he's outlined on the day of on the day of calvary that day that was symbolized with moses taking his hand out of his bosom and it being finished it was finished the great prophet shepherd had brought them the message and they were delivered the prophet shepherd we're not preaching the words of a man but we're preaching the message of a prophet shepherd and brother that's why in this sermon he switches all you know i like it when he switches you pay attention to though he's talking about something and he starts talking about something else and he all of a sudden he starts talking about no man has a right to enter the sacred desk to preach the word until he has did as moses did meet god himself no man has a right to preach the word until he's met god for himself because if if he hasn't he's just preaching his own ideas but if he's met god on that sacred sands it's the word of god he said no man by a theological degree or some doctor's degree has a right behind the pulpit to claim the message of jesus christ until he's first met god face to face in the pillar of fire do you see what a sublime message this is why it had to be shepherds why it's got to be preached that's what i believe brother brown was saying in this sermon he said he's no right to call himself a messenger because all the theologians in the world couldn't explain that away from you it happened to you you were there you know about it just like those shepherds that went and they knew about what the angels had told them because they saw the baby wrapped in swaddling clothes they saw mary and joseph they sat and listened to mary and joseph's testimony as mary told them about how the angel had told her you're going to have a child and it's going to be named jesus and they were there and that when they left that place they had a message they had a message because they had experienced it he said i don't care what you don't care what anybody else says or how much they can say the days is gone it isn't so it happened to you and it's according to the word that's when the gospel will preach when when some when you've been through an experience with you've been on a journey and you're not just talking about something that you read about but you're talking about something that you've lived you're talking about something that you've gone through and he said that's the reason moses knew this voice had spoke to him it was a word voice that's how you know whether it's true as you're sitting here tonight if it's a word voice you see we've got a secret to preach and you the musicians can go ahead on that we'll close on this we've got a secret to preach we're not here to preach a creed and we're not here to preach man's ideas or our own petty thoughts or preach from our complexes but we've got a shepherd's message to preach a separate shepherd's message like paul saying there in first corinthians i determine not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified that's what we're preaching christ is our shepherd and that's what we're preaching about amen do you believe that this afternoon it had to be shepherds why do they have to be shepherds to declare that the great shepherd is here he's here let's stand to our feet and just worship him a little bit thank you amen at the end of that sermon brother he asked the people he said how many of those that had to be a shepherd amen amen it had to be a shepherd as so many people are getting away from shepherds and getting away you can't get away
