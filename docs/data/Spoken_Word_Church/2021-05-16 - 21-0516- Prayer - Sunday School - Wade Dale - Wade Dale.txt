========================================

we have man there's a electricity in the air then kids downstairs they threw me out all the sunscreen classes so that's too big and too old so i left good to be in the house of the lord good to have each and every one of you here we're gonna try to start this and uh and see how it works we don't uh we don't wanna hinder the spirit we don't wanna handle the spirit of worship but we do wanna get back into our sunday school classes i mean the kids are really excited about getting back in the sunday school class amen because we are sheep and we need we have to be led and we need to be led of the lord so if you would turn your bibles if you want to just for a moment to genesis now this is not in the uh what they're going to put up because i want you to read this in your bible genesis 4 verse 26 what we're going to talk today just briefly on prayer i told you we would take one one topic actually take one word and then that word we will use for as many times as we need it to talk about it just in a sunday school class okay so prayer genesis 4 verse 26 it says unto seth and him also there was born a son and he called his name enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord now if you go back in genesis 2 1 2 3 and 4 god spoke straight to adam he spoke straight to eve god spoke straight to abel and god spoke directly to cain amen so that was the line of communication because with the way it's going to end up is the way it was in the beginning we're not going to need prayer when we get them to take a body change it's all going to be done and over you won't need prayer prayer is a communication because you can't get directly to god except by prayer and that's what we're going to read here in just a minute but then after the fall in genesis 4 they had a son named seth adam and eve did and said then man began to call upon the name of the lord which means they began to pray because they could not get to god like adam and eve and even abel and cain could get to god amen and we can't get to god like adam and eve got to god right i mean he would come and walk in the cool today sure i wish god would appear but now he literally appeared to adam and eve and talk to them person to person back and forth and we know that the bible covers and we may cover a little bit later the bible covers that that moses talked to god lip to ear well now you got to remember he was under the blood of bulls and goes it wasn't the almighty god standing in front of him remember he came as different people like the captain of the host and he came as melchizedek he was veiled in something because you can't see god amen and then moses said i want to see god god showed him the back part of him but he did not show him his face remember because he had to kill him if he showed him his face amen so now let's look at this to pull up the word prayer it's an invocation or an act that seeks to activate a rapport with an object of worship through deliberate communication in other words prayer you you know some people may pray to the devil some people may pray to an idol some people may pray to a building or or whatever but we pray to god we are the only people on the face of the earth that knows who to pray to right all right so it says in the narrow sense the term refers to an act of supplication or intersection intercession directed towards a deity or a deified ancestor well we don't have no deified ancestor we have a daddy named god that's his name is jesus christ so we know who we're praying to but now remember when you look in the bible let's go to genesis 3 18 there is when it talks about pray that pray there is not to pray that you pray for an intercession or pray to somebody this is in hebrews the lexicon told us tells us it's a it's an exhortation in other words freda i pray that you'll come to church well now i'm not going to pray but i'm going to bring up the next one he says i pray thee so it's a primitive particle of incitement or entreaty all right so it's not prayer like communication prayer from me to from me to god it's pray now please in other words please please come to church i pray that you'll come to church well you know you're not going to really pray and you're just you're saying a word that says please or an exhortation so you have to keep those two separate believe me there's 480 something references to prayer in the bible and i read every one of them and some of them has nothing to do with prayer to god it's i pray that you'll come i pray that you'll do this amen so now let's go to genesis though this is the first time that the word pray is for an intercession or for a communication to god and look who it happens to it happens to abraham the prophet abraham he has just given his wife away the second time he just gave his wife away and now he's telling them now therefore restore the man his wife he's talking to abimelech which is the the king of that time and he's going to take sarah to be his wife and god's not going to let that happen so he says look now he's talking to abimbly he says now therefore restore the man to his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee that's the first time in the bible that that word pray means go to the hebrew lexicon is to intervene interpose to mediate to intercede or to pray all right so that's palau pow lao in the greek or hebrew and that is now become the where it comes to abraham which is abraham's what the father of us all the father of faith and what he does is is god right there in genesis 20 verse 7 and we'll read that leave it up because look it says in genesis 27 he talks about pray for thee then genesis 2017 abraham prayed unto god a prayer of intercession or a prayer of of communication and god healed abimelech and his wife and his maidservants and they bear children because god told the bible and he said if you touch that woman he said i'll close every womb up in egypt and he said i'll destroy your country but he had to have abraham come and pray for him everybody okay with that now let's go to numbers 11 verse 2. so now and the people cried unto moses now this is the first time moses prays a prayer of intercession because listen moses prayed many prayers for these people because they were always needing prayer amen but now remember when we look at this in exodus coming to numbers the people said god because see god was wanting to talk to him like he did in the garden of eden god said bring him to the mountain i'll talk to him lip to ear the people said no we don't want that happen we want somebody to intercede or to pray for us and he they said let moses pray for us and then we'll do whatever he says well they didn't do everything he said but every time they got in trouble moses prayed unto the lord and the fire was quenched so there was a prayer of intercession or mediation and even we're going to get to it a little while we might not get to it today but the bible talks about even when we pray for the sick if you pray an earnest prayer for the sick you can get your sins forgiven amen and if he has any sins they'll be forgiven we'll not get to that today i want to try to get to a spot and then we'll stop because we're going to try to calibrate all this where we can have time and then it won't be rushed but we don't have to do a big long um like a sunday school class we used to do downstairs i'd rather do it just keep this one word of pray because remember one more time we're going to read in psalms 5 verse 1 watch this to the chief musician the psalm of david now david was one that could pray because the whole book of psalms is a prayer a prayer of exhortation and get me out of this and i need you and all these things because remember we need prayer brother branham tells us that it's the most powerful weapon but it's temporary remember it's powerful it's the most the only way that we can talk to god because the bible tells us to put pray without ceasing so prayer and intercession is our greatest weapon but it's not going to last though because when we get to now see here we here in in the message of the hour we have people that have superseded that and brought it back to well we're already in the millennium and we already we don't need to pray we're already god made manifest in another form that's what you said brother wade yes we do but you still need prayer right because you still sin every day you still backside every day and the only way to keep from backsliding and sinning is to pray to god he's the only intercessor you don't pray to brother dale you don't pray that william branham you pray to god amen amen and you don't need a picture and you don't need to get into all these different places and positions let's don't be catholics bible tells us pray without ceasing how many times have you went down the road and and something pop up in you in your mind of thinking of somebody and you go god bless the people you know you remember the old saying is the ringing in the air your ear starts ringing you need to start praying for somebody because something's happening that's the bells of heaven going off well you know what sometimes it if it goes off god may want you to pray but when something comes on your heart don't pray that brother dale will pray for your kids because we do that anyway but pray you pray for your kids you can pray as we get all this together we see this intercessory prayer though has been tainted by the catholic church because see you got to pray to a dead saint that prays to god you got to pray to a priest that prays to god you got to pray to the pope that prays to god you don't have to do that not as a christian as a christian you pray straight to god almighty you don't have to go through an angel now god may send an angel to help you right but you're praying to almighty god and you're not praying to a second person of a trinity or a third person of the trinity you're praying to almighty god the creator of heaven and earth hearken unto the voice of my cry my king and my god for unto thee will i pray my voice shall thou hear in the morning o lord in the morning will i direct my prayer unto thee and will look up now god told them we it's later on in here but i want to bring this out you know god told the people that if they'll just look toward the temple and pray jonah look toward the temple and pray if you get in trouble look toward the temple because that was the old testament that's where they knew god was at the time see you and i don't have to pray toward lula georgia we don't have to pray toward jeffersonville uh-uh you pray to god because you know where he is you're the only people in the world that knows where he is amen we know he's in our heart but what does remember in our heart we still have to communicate we still have to pray don't be like the people that are in the message that see how close it is though you come over here and you say well you're saying we're almighty god and we're god in human flesh and we're the bride and we're this and we're that you still need prayer amen because you're still in a sinful condition you're still in a sinful body and you still have memories and conscious effects and imagination to deal with for unto thee will i pray my voice shalt thou hear in the morning o lord in the morning will i direct my prayer unto thee and will look up let's go to proverbs 15 verse 8. the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the lord but the prayer of the upright is his delight wow god delights he loves for you to pray to him he's never too busy we we know that but sometimes we go well maybe i'll pray tomorrow i'll no you need to pray right then because god may want you to pray now truly there is an intercession where you can intercede for someone brother brown said you get to so sick you can't pray for yourself you need somebody to pray for you but it's not that i've got to pray to this one and then it connects to that one and then it connects to this one no you're praying a prayer because you're outside and uh for some of your sisters that have lost your husbands i can't pray for that some of the sisters that have husband but you can you can pray for somebody like sister cathy that just lost her her husband and vice versa the other way we can enter i can't enter in i was there was a guy last saturday he had just lost his wife she was only like 50 something years old died suddenly and he comes out to the mailbox and he's telling me about this situation that he was in that his wife just died and he was just you know teared up well see i couldn't and i told him i said buddy i'll pray for you i said but i can't enter into your to your situation because my wife's still alive but god does put us in situations where many times we've seen where if like when sister hazel died brother gary atkins was here brother gary krantz they had lost wives before and they could help or intercede with brother tom and different ones and even went to the hospital with them because they what because they their situation was that they could enter in or intercede and say god i know how that person feels right so see you can tell somebody you pray for them but if somebody says well you know what i mean talking about my wife no i don't know what you mean i've still got mine but i can pray that god will give you comfort because he's the only one who can comfort you amen and we don't question why god does things but we know that there's one thing for sure prayer changes things we'll get into that next sunday not this anymore brother brown says prayer changes things but the prayer of the upright is his delight now let's go to isaiah 56 verse 7. even then will i bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon my altar now this is the old testament because look for my house shall be called a house of prayer now this is sacrifices this is what they laid on the altar but they still had to pray lay their hands on that sacrifice and say god forgive me in my sins they're not praying to the dead animal they're praying to god but that's the only way they could get to him in the old testament because in new testament now we live under a new testament we're going to talk about this afternoon where now jesus christ is our mediator he is our lamb that died he is the one that we pray to because he's almighty god we don't pray to another person we pray to almighty god so when you talk to god be careful that's who you're talking to for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the people now jesus refers to this scripture when he drives the thieves out of the or the people that are selling in the temple he drives them out he said my father has made this a house of prayer and you've made it a dent of thieves that's the scripture he's talking about isaiah 56. many times i know we we read through the new testament but most of the time jesus is quoting the old testament because that's how he came under he came under the old testament all right so this shall be called a house of prayer for all people now let's go to daniel 9 verse 20 and while i was speaking and praying and confessing my sins and the sins of my people israel and presenting my suffocation before the lord for the holy mountain of my god what happened is daniel opened up his shutters and he did what god said he prayed toward that temple and god heard him because and while i was speaking in prayer even the man gabriel who had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation so but now remember this is old testament so he needed gabriel he needed they needed the archangel they needed all these different ones in the old testament but remember you don't pray to gabriel now you don't you pray to jesus christ we know that gabriel was an angel but it was somebody that they were very familiar with because remember gabriel was always the one that brought him a message he brought him he brought a message to him he brought a message to mary amen yet while i was speaking in prayer matthew 5 verse 44. let's get into the new testament just a minute we'll stop right here but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you how many of you do that i don't want your hands it embarrass all of us brother wade waste time praying for my enemies i'm just telling you what the bible says because that prayer may touch that person that prayer life will help you now watch this in matthew 6 5 and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites for they love to pray standing in the synagogues in the corners of the streets that's why that sometimes you hear people and they want to pray louder than the rest of the people or they won't pray longer than the rest of the people listen folks if you're taking up an offer and pray for the offering don't pray for the house and the senate and and you know and and for people in another church you're praying for the offering okay same way with responsive reading and all that pray it's not prayer request time brother terence's prayer request time so you pray for the prayer request you get up here pray the prayer that you need to pray at the time because when do we do most of our earnest praying it's not here in church i thought the prophet said you need to be prayed up before you get here pray it up before you get here not be unfamiliar with prayer before you get here and then practice it in the church that's not what it's not what god's saying all right let's read that again thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are because remember what did jesus do they were standing in the synagogue one day and this one over here was just praying this big loud prayer and this other one i'm just so glad i'm not like that sinner over there and then the guy over here was praying lord i'm sorry forgive me he said which one did my father hear he didn't hear that loud one he heard that guy here because this guy was honest he said i'm praying for me you know a lot of times we need to pray for ourselves we're the first one that needs it oh yeah everybody else has got different needs but you pray that you get yourself out of the way they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the street that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward now it's not going to be a good one but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and thou when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward you openly and look it says but when we pray use not vain repetition in other words the same thing over and over again as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking be be not thou therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask this is my last point right here you say well god already knows god already knows what's going to happen why do we need to pray well he knew two things he knew you weren't going to pray or he knew you were going to pray so by foreign knowledge he had both of them waiting if you he knew if you weren't going to pray this is what she was going to get he knew if you did pray this is what she was going to give we go back to the foreknowledge of god knowing if you you say well we always talk about praying for our kids but we can't save our kids but that prayer of intercession god knows we as brother louise and the different ones and we all we pray earnestly for our children then let god work on that end but he's he's listening to what the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much so let's finish this right here and then we'll stop musicians come as soon as i get finished reading this and after this manner therefore pray ye and let's all stand and let's say the lord's prayer you ready our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth not on earth in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen musicians come you may be seated we'll stop right there and we'll start again matthew 21 says in all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing you shall receive it wow what about that whatever you ask in prayer you shall receive it so i've never received anything of i prayed 10 times for my kids i prayed 20 years for my kids keep praying keep praying but you know what check yourself first that's right because we're going to get into it a little bit further on down the line that that the bible says if you pray with your hair cut god's not going to hear your prayer it's an abomination that's bible brother brown said he won't hear your prayer for intercept he'll only hear for your prayer for you to forgive you for what you did sisters and brothers be careful because we the same way because we're all feminists in the body of christ amen all right so god bless you they're going to play some some music and then brother joe will come up thank you
