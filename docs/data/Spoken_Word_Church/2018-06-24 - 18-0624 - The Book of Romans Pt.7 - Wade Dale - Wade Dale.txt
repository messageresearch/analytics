========================================

no throwing it go boom there we go that's it I kind of backed up a little bit and hit verse Romans of three we were kind of like circumcision last Sunday and so I want to back up just and read a little bit of this because I want you to watch Paul continuous thought Paul Stoddard's continually you know he'll hammer once dubbed it and then he'll he'll get off of it but then they'll revisit it later on so he's getting on it here and then he'll be getting on in four days we've got all those a little bit so watch to declare I said this time his righteousness they might that he might be just and the justifier of him which believed in Jesus name once he taught me so much circumcision circumcision or uncircumcision it made no difference in the flesh if you're certain times or uncircumcised is done it's the circumcision of the heart right it's the it's the excess skin that you have in your foot in your rub spirit being that we need to keep cutting away so Oh sister Johnny's mom passed away some of the family that's probably why she's not here also remember us we're going to be gone next Sunday and the next onion a lot of other people are too so remember if we're gonna go Oklahoma and then we're gonna go to Branson Missouri for a little while Claudia ginger and then come back free friend it's like that one did you do the last one so you did the one before that yes so it releases don't now he was gone he was that's right so it leave me Louisa sterner your turn because you had a full month then ham that name up this Louisa starts Oh Louisa have next Sunday you got the Sunday after that okay the Sunday after that when you show up next Sunday and Louise is doing it you do it the next Monday that's the Sunday ever back hey Louise has got the first alright then we got all the other signs good people everybody's covered with you - I appreciate that thank you a lot of people want to use counseling stuff so just remember selling crack the declare I said at this time this rocks instead he might be Justin to justify him to believe in Jesus now what's called on Matt he went he's going through the part of uncertainty and uncertainty where is boasting then in the clip excluded because what the Jews were doing they were boasting we are the cup we did what Abraham told us today so we're under that Abraham covenant that if we were circumcised but the problem is they lean more to the circumcision than they did to Abraham's bill even because Abraham what the father of our circumcision I handled the father of our faith man so and what that's what he's trying to get then the Jews remember the Jews came to Jesus and said we'd be late for him see why so they were circumcised naturally in the flesh so they said we've done everything that we you know we've done everything we do wrong we gotta move this quote book we go by moment right we've been circumcised so we're fine Jesus is like you may have been fine before but you're not fine now no there's a new covenant coming in there's a new Testament and the blood of Jesus Christ that will eradicate sin not just covering because even in Abraham's condition whatever happened to Abraham not only covered his sin God didn't take away from Abraham what's not a child of God Abraham the friend of God that's why people don't and you see people still weird louia you come okay well you've got next Sunday school class next week gonna be okay thank you but Lewis is running you know need running the guy the other day that boost oh did I have had a lengthy discussion about the people in the Old Testament not have a linear birth but remember I told you the new birth eternal life you go you got to pull that apart compartmentalize it because it's not exactly the same thing right you can be a part of eternal life and not have the new birth but the new birth in the end eternal life so you you have but you gotta think about that goal Abraham did get eternal life but anyway I'm didn't give you eternal life while he was here in flesh right somewhere when Jesus died when the saints went into whatever dimension they went into they were imparted eternal life because they were the blood of bulls and goats and then the blood of Jesus Christ get away with their sin but you and I are born again here alive so now here's Paul and that has everything to do with what Paul's talking about because Paul says I'm born again doesn't matter if I'm circumcised he was because he was new wasn't you all right he was circumcised but he's talking to the uncircumcised and the circumcised trying to get him to say hey quit back okay God brother branham was trying to get hours listening to take the other days tell my trainees you bad this message this you message spot the Lutheran you lose them five to Penn College you better call a clinic off alright so they're sitting there fighting each other and he said saying don't have to do anything he just left y'all fight right so and that's what Paul's do the palms walking with a group of people that says well I'm circumcised I'm doing everything that the Old Testament standing policy that's fine cuz it keep talking to law watch where it's boasting then is excluded so that he's saying Jews Campos de jure under this covenant because that coming that's been annulled done away with when Christ died Louise she got make something okay July 1st you hear clear thank you I wanna build your for you bigger win tonight with us to what is boasting then it is excluded by white law well the law in the Old Testament said if you circumcised because circumcised circumcision did not save Abraham that's what they're going to saying that circumcision is what saves us that's what the Jews was thing but he'd never saved Abraham it was just a sign that God accepted the faith of Abraham okay so that's what he's fixing to talk about going on down to Roman's force or watch by my law works actual cutting on the flag no name but by the law of faith right therefore we conclude there's his conclusion we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law right he's not finished though is he the god of the Jews only what's Paul doing he's trying to bring them together is he not also of the Gentiles yes of the Gentiles also seeing it is one God I'm at the bottom of the chaplain looking from seeing it is one guy which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith all right so by faith we're standing here with Griff a there believe what would they do it they were believing unto Abraham was believing unto Isaiah was believing unto all those Old Testament people were believing unto what that the Messiah was don't come and say all right but now a circumcision by faith is a people standing on it we're circumcised by faith now amen do we then make void the law through faith no like I said last time you can take the Old Testament and throw it in the trash it's given four examples huge examples of the way you should live do we then make more than off your faith god forbid yea we establish the law in other words we're the only ones that can really believe what the law say alright remarkably all right Roma for now watch continue the thought continue the thought what shall we say then now well he's bringing Abraham in what shall we say then that Abraham our Father as pertaining to the flesh hath bound may for him your seeds going to be covered the earth like the sand in the ocean all right for if Abraham were justified by works now we know he circumcised itself but that wasn't that was just showing that was an outward show then he believed what God said where they for him were justified by works he hath whereof to glory cuz you feel remember when Abraham circumcised these circumcised himself at ninety nine years old I took a lot of faith - do-it-yourself at 99 with no pain medication does that one thing but he had faith but now watch though Abraham never speaks of that again read your Bible now people speak of Abraham and his circumcision and Abraham of the things that he did but Abraham never boast that I'm certain that I'm certain size and you know I'm know they've read he was Abraham until he died and then later on though the stories were told don't remember what written down until Moses wrote them down Genesis Exodus Leviticus and numbers so that the story of Abraham was not written until Moses wrote it in the Torah are the first five books of the Bible but somewhere between there and that's our problem somewhere between that point and where Paul was standing and even where Jesus is standing it got so messed up that they said it was all the certain seasons while saying not to faith of Abraham because when they come to these Jews that were circumcised that's it we're done we're circumcised well believe on Jesus ha he's the devil well circumcision did them no good okay but if they would have had the faith of Abraham remember what Jesus saying before Abraham was I am if you would have believed a for him you'd believe me you'd believe Moses you believe me he told him he said you're not believing you're just going by works you're not believing you have no faith in what they did for certain guys we're done that's it then we'll priests are standing there less than after them women in their mind and and under the law there was no problem because well I'll just said you touch a woman are you are you 20 commit fornication but jesus walks up and says I want to talk to the inside guy the inside guy is the one you got probably and that's the one that you're left with now he Jesus is I say unto thee if you look on a woman to lust during your heart you have committed adultery with her already well you can't commit adultery in your mind right adultery is an act between a man and a woman in the play they said spiritual adultery we know that but natural this what we're talking about natural adulkin to the priest were going we're circumcised and hope you get this in today you know I go to church I read my Bible that's okay that's good but you got to keep going you got to keep doing the thing you gotta have faith listen you got to faith in what you do if you just kill this recurrence because it's a ritual or because you're gonna get talked about if you don't come you might as well go somewhere else but if you have a by faith I was thinking it wasn't me brother John would had a discussion the other day after father's that thing you know yes it's by faith that we do things not of works lest any man should but that's what that's what we read here you know no I can boast but but it's not we do these things by faith we have faith I have Johnson I have faith that if I put my last ten dollars in the collection plate by faith if I put not just ritual he said if I put ten my last ten dollars by faith God's got to honor of that and bring it back a hundredfold so if he puts in ten you'll give him back hundred somewhere because he said I've seen it done that in my life he said but I have faith he said I have faith when I come to church I'm gonna hear from God not not that I'm just going to get the church and we're just gonna talk about this and then we're gonna have little family discussions and then we're gonna you know then we're gonna go home no you buy faith for if Abraham was justified by works you know that millions of people are going to get a gold star for going to church every Sunday and that stars will be available with that star means nothing right but now if you do that and have faith that God will do something for you big difference and you'll see it manifest and we think you stand manifest in your life that if you do something by faith God will honor it but if you do something by works because we're not justified no work we're justified by faith but then our faith remember James have the discussion my works and my faith but as it works his faith expressed that's the sermon title works this faith expressed so if you come to church knowing that God's gonna do something for you and knowing that brother Brian said you can't wait till the doors open to get the church now that's just not coming in sitting down I believe brother Brown was talking about the inward man the end one person has a desire to go to church okay sometimes we let the flesh get involved well human where Abraham were justified by works he has to wear up to glory but not before God okay not before God because remember Abraham had all the scenario Abraham was is a man walked up to him one day and said you're gonna have a baby with Sarah and I'm gonna bless that whole lineage and him 90 years old and Sarah 80 well 75 million sixty five hundred first total then he walked 25 years 25 years so he had faith without works but what did his faith produce his faith produced works because he finally got a body change and had the baby and that's our whole deal here's I mean somebody the other day accountant living man Tony but you know we think well we used to all this time trying to figure out how can we hide a gun or hide some food man listen Dave ball 55-gallon drum of gasoline one time we put it in the hottest place you can put fake in there with you know what we were thinking and then we did we buried 22 shells as we can't even find we can't find them we hear them up friend the young end of woods and we can't find them I mean when a prelude to a metal detectors and try to find can't find them well here's what they're useless but that was the mentality back then was we were going to try to make it through a certain part of not tribulation but the certain part of the of the you know the squeeze or the whatever you want to call it but hey look now they look at technology think Drive bar you house Canyon house tell where you are how much money you got anything in your home and your cell phone is the DPS they've already turned it on and convicted people with it so forget about trying to hide you better have faith because I'll promise you your words will do you no good that's what's gonna happen and I'm telling you now we're gonna come up to a place when that doors closed you're done you're done for if you're not in Christ and if you're not if you don't think about it we may talk about this a little bit later but remember the third pole is not a public third full is not a public show the third poll is not a public anything right even up here in the sanctuary it's an individual that comes to a place they can say god I need a drink of water God I need to be here oh I need a pork chop god I need a sure that's all thanks I'm stateless so if we get into work pack enough word into where God can man we can be manifested sons of God my brother they'll teach enough things to be manifested sons have died then what's the third pole the third pole is going to pull us away from those things it's going to pull us to a place that then nobody's been being brought before because we've always said third pole but I believe we've always started with the third push there's a big difference because we're trying to push everything you know won't even I'm gonna buy me all this stuff and put it up you know it's not bad to have that stuff but the other thing I'm saying I'm just saying don't sit there and lead them that talk to a brother one time and bless his heart he just about a shell as well anyway he's gonna buy gold and buy silver and then he's going to be able to wants to squeeze happens there won't be no paper money so he's gonna be able to I said so you're gonna take a brick of gold this works about $2,500 if you gonna try to get final over together we're gonna do shading out of there just that way I said you just one you're gonna shave some weight off of that I said no they gonna take that whole big bottle of gold you got so you know like I said though that was so carnal though that we're gonna try to make it through the squeeze no once we get to that point God is obligated to take a screw so I put on my face like a crown cuz watch Abraham listen Abraham with a human being here's Hagar young girl here's Abraham 75 still can produce you know understand Jason okay I'll help God that sound like you've done it I don't help God and when he produced not the will of God he produced an Ishmael which is what's fighting over yonder now right but when finally Abraham comes down one day and says dawn of 99 I can't even get out of bed in the morning Sarah team remember where she's out half the time okay and God said okay that's where I want you and then one day to wake up what brand new people brand new 20-year old ready they're ready to do what God said to do but it wasn't them doing it it was God doing it so that's the best thing for us to do say God you promised it you promised it so it's not my words you see how updated this is now this is Paul talking the Romans they are not talking about body change they're not talking about even coming to adoption but he's teaching and option to try to get the people to come up to a level to see something but you know what this word eternal so guess what today this is justice this is updated as it's gonna get this is today word right here okay cuz what we're putting it in the now body change right my favor hand was justified by works he had we're up to glory but not before God why because God knew he's won they did it they ground them for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness first the abraham believed god then the sign of circumcision came to prove that he had believed i'm guns already said now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt alright look he just worked as a balance sheet something god if i'll do this you got you you know i so max not balance sheet now now we're waiting the balance is the found water all right so no don't work god now if i go to church five times you're obligated doesn't know but if you'll go to church 25 times thinking you'll get something from God and you're not coming to see everybody but God you know what he's obligated them to do it now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt because remember grace is what unmerited favor not of works lest any man should boast but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness well I said we've got to be a believing group of people yes I mean we got to believe we don't believe in something they were saying hey man but you know what I see what he does I see the Word of God and I said that's thinking this morning you know when I walked around in the world with sin now there was no there was no God inside of me because none was gone and then clean vessel I'm always trying to ask the people said look when out unclean spirit goes out of a man where does it at if it's unclean God can't be in there all right come the Bible says the iron things buried goes out of a man all right so God and he'll can't be in there in that unclean spirit can't be in that same time what you're doing is you're making a way once that unclean spirits gone you making a way for God to come in but there is still representation in this Bible this is the seed that everybody's trying to think in some little spot some little eater this is their right here I was in this so now in the beginning was the word and once they met this morning to begin what's the word the Word was with God and word what the word the seed in the beginning was to see seed was with God Satan thing done man right so now that's where I'm identified in the seed Word of God right here so when he came on the earth I was in him not an unnatural jerm numpy because remember and this is for later on but remember Jesus inherited eternal life in his flesh so you and I were not in his flesh right no no we were in the British soul or the essence of that man Jesus that's where we work right so we weren't in the flesh so by the flesh we're not kidding to Jesus but now once the inherited eternal life now when you inherit something what do you do it's yours and you know what if I inherit something who died give it to my and my joint out so he received eternal life in the flesh so that we can receive eternal life in the flesh but he had but he had to be eternal life in his soul work and that's the word that's what was in the beginning was the word right there by alright so that so now that I can count that when I was walking the walk of the center God wasn't nowhere in my soul he can't dwell in an unclean vessel right but I was in the word I just hadn't realized it yet I had come to that place yet toward God can quicken I had to hear the word so I had to receive but then he quickened it and then when he quickened did that made in life that's why we can read scripture like we do now and not be confused because the one that wrote it is in you okay but to him that worketh not now they don't mean you don't have to do nothing you hear what I'm saying that see everybody no we don't have to do nothing really you know you can be circumcised go to church never dream never comes next well but you're still a sin right to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth know the only one person they can justify right according to the first seal one true Living God is the only justifier of anybody is that one true and living God named Jesus Christ right that justifies the ungodly well that must have been us we were not of God when we come into this world we were of our parents and then of a sinful nature we were of God in the word but we hadn't come to that yet but now look his faith is counted for righteousness to change our body that's once they had to change it to come to the change of the body it can't be any do's and don'ts that you did not one doing don't did you that no one show me one show me what I'm doing though did you can do they don't change your body there's not one well I go to check we may not be able to get to everyone like a notice my faith Abraham I don't believe Abraham the morning he got his body change I don't believe that night he stayed up all night and had this real religious experience you know say one thing he just woke up one morning and he was in the place God wanted him to be in but he looked over and thought he got her own bed because he had a real young wife leaned over the side of me then he looked in the mirror and said you know what he knew that was it because his face had what been counted his faith was counted but now his faith was now fulfilled because he hadn't been changed back with something he couldn't do and they had one son I think which was the promised son all right so it's not about works but your works is your faith Express so don't ever forget work because I promise you in this day and age with all this technology and all this stuff like they said the other day you know you're being watched whether you know you're being watched or not there's cameras everywhere well God's been that since the beginning of time he said I camera on all of us you know me what we're doing on the earth is just manifesting to a degree the ones I've already been doing right even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin though that word impute means to is the verb to reckon or to count now look at David my David and his best friend killed murdered murdered that was premeditated murder he would have been that would have been a federal offense in this day and age and he'd be putting federal prison because he told the guys when the battles high would draw yourself show that he can die then he takes his wife he's already committed adultery with his wife before this but remember she was pregnant and to cover that pregnancy up she had to get you Rock Hill so that he can say what a man that's the guy I'm telling you about that's telling you that the blessedness under him God imputed right this without work and he did because God would have killed him if it was just been my work so I'm going to went through Nathan and said David you're the man so you're gonna die but what did he do we grace he went to Nathan the Prophet God came to Nathan the prophet and said David I've seen your sin I know what you've done but I know the integrity of what that very inside man okay which wasn't born again but he had an integrity they covered him because God knew what he would do if he would have had that man the man Jesus inside of it he would have never done this thanks but what uh but what a great what a great thing though that we can read about David and don't think it's so much of David until he's going to get the title of the son of David in the Millennium City would be I never intended to be a kingdom that would then be son of David to be on the phone for you know thousand years but now we would have convicted him and put it in prison right by his work all right but look we consider the end of the conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday they have ever David was so much like God really spoke in the first person right there's my hands on my feet and all the different things when he was anointed God look David could only say sins are covered did you kick step did you catch that in the Old Testament stands were covered in the New Testament those sins have done away with just like I said about having a married in heaven uh those but it's a lot you have a husband that's allowed he's there he's right here they don't matter you never see him again a day in your life he's still alive but he's dead your freedom and blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin look what so Paul is saying look now come at this blessedness then upon the circumcision only in other words all this I've said lesser than iniquities O Lord will not impute sin circumcision only harm upon the uncircumcision also called bringing the two groups together right when we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness not it worked right how was it then reckon see Paul asked the question and then the answer me how was it then reckon when he was in circumcision or in uncertainty because remember in Abraham's faith started when he says Abraham he doesn't after twelve Abraham get up and get out of the land go to a land I'm telling you that was when the faith debate with him began not when he was circumcised so that's what he's saying how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in seventeen circumcision was asked to them was that was after the type of the Holy Ghost right he had walked for years years he they already had a smelly give his life away already one time and all these different things of that Abraham did in walking in uncircumcision but it was reckoned see that's what he's telling because of you know the Jews are going Abraham circumcised and we believe by Abraham you know he Paul said you're believing because of the circumcision that he's the father your faith so he said the father your faith started in uncertainty God started honoring his faith before he was physically circumcised okay amen look and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had which he had yet being uncertain sucker that's what he's telling them he said Noah well he is destroying no one of the Romans Hank I mean no one of the Jews hated him because he's destroyed their whole doctrine right here he destroyed it he had yet being a circumcised that he might be the father of all of them that believe though they be not circumcised remember he's going to see the Romans so the Jews and the Romans are going to come together you know the Romans were prefer or uncircumcised you know Gentile to use the circumcised but what's Paul trying to do he's saying look we got to put this thing together then he might be the father of all them to believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed under them also it's not that everybody dispenses with circumcised is going to heaven ever by this uncircumcised blond hell that's pretty much what did you say tea-things desecrate our temple by letting do other Timothy or when I walk into the into the temple and then somebody was talking the other day and they get records of that today Kevin when you were circumcised he was circumcised by the priests and that record was kept let's see when Timothy walked into the temple they might have known if not known if he was a Jew or whatever but the priests were going hang on our record where were you circumcised and Timothy probably went I'm not there like you're standing in our temple you've desecrated falls like a Roman oh then you know you see what's going on here and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but they will also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised he said that twice there for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to a him our to get seeds through the law because they can read the Torah the courtesan Abraham your seed is good you can't look up Abraham right look up Abraham see the Stars you're Steve's go with the Jews alive men were part of that I would we're one of that great big they went being part of that if they didn't believe if they didn't believe they weren't part of that sure physically they work but not spiritually and for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his see us through the law but through what the righteousness of faith look for if they which are of the law be heirs I circumcised my son he circumcised his son he circumcised his son he circumcised then son always wait with him down so that's what - that's what the priests were saying my name's Ben in this book four generations from this one was circumcised my day circumcise me is that circumcised anything that's what they're saying Paul sin nowhere don't care about your book show me some faith all right foreign language read the law of the airspace is bait boy don't be just by the law faith has been made boy and the promise made of non effects when the promise has no effect because the law worketh wrath why did they'll all work it round there was no great there was no grace in the law right for where no law is there is no transgression pretty simple therefore it is a faith that needs continue this though therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace by grace through faith to the Enda the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written it was interpolating now what's he doing though that's that's telling that's back in Genesis 12 or 13 somewhere in there as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him who believed even God who quickeneth the dead now we read that and said why wouldn't he question Abraham Abraham was physically dead and his body in his flexion understand he wasn't physically dead died dead but his body could not produce what God called him to produce okay so God quickened the day he trained change his body and call it those things which be not as though they were Abraham's you can have a child yeah we'll have a child how old Sarah she why don't you buy 94 and I'm 9 9 or what it was 1998 and 99 and the people are like but you know what after they got a body change the people that didn't know them didn't have a clue but now I ever have a family probably didn't Sarah's family probably went what's going on here but you know what if they didn't believe it one County to them in it the Promised One team of that child one counted in nobody but Abraham was there no there and us because it was Abraham Sarah and the seed after him okay look who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which the spoken so shall thy seed be thanks talking look he's talking natural father many nations right and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now data when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb which on other words he never he never leaned on the part that I can't produce and Sarah came Perdue he said God you told if we don't have the baby you'll have to do the same way with the body chain we've got to give us a thinking the other day you know it he give us a road map he goes to a road map now for those of you that are old enough to remember the old road map were folded right yeah gonna follow the thing five fold ministry open the map anyway I do that think of thing that was well I did I thought well you know there's a road map but we used to fold there it man I didn't know you had to get a mat folding 101 to get some thing back together right but we've got a five fold map that we have a five fold ministry that we believe will give us there so he's already give us everything he already give that Abraham but Abraham's level up but anchor ham didn't have a leavener determine Abraham didn't have a Bible a abraham believed what somebody said any head and got accounted that for his faith those he believed that was God telling him at all right he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God now look he did stagger in his humanity it was wife Elaine had relations with Hagar try his best to do everything he could to help God and you think I've messed up but I like what one brother Stan said but if you look back to the Old Testament yes you see but when polyps through the Old Testament he had to look through Calvary he had to look through the blood curtain and through the blood curtain there was no thing when they were Helms faith come across who was a grim fate Jesus Christ was Abraham's faith he is the fact okay the things that we have was in Jesus Christ so if you look back through the blood he never stagger yeah so he's gonna be the father of our faith of what you know I mean we stagger human being but we staggered not at the promise the promise not all the other stuff the promise but was strongly faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised who's that he God but God had promised he was able to perform and therefore it was imputed or counted or reckoned to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for that's also Paul he brings him everyone together to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our what justification night amen so we'll stop right there and go to Roman's 5 and a couple weeks resolution so man it still gets real good being justified by faith he brings justification by faith all right the Lord bless you
