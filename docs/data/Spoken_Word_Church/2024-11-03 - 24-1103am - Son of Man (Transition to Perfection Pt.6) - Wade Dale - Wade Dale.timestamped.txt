[17:52] we're coming back here to
[17:53] live amen there's a few of the the
[17:57] couple questions this afternoon this
[17:58] afternoon to be questions and answers um
[18:00] I'm going to say it's not going to be
[18:01] long but it is one of the questions is
[18:04] what is the difference in like paradise
[18:06] um heaven and and all that so we're
[18:09] going to answer that and one question
[18:11] that says please in 20 minutes or less
[18:14] explain Daniel 70 weeks
[18:16] so uh with the help of the
[18:20] Lord cuz he's going to have to do it I
[18:22] can't but I think I've got it condensed
[18:24] down where we can talk about it and get
[18:26] the Gest of it because what's going to
[18:28] happen is now later when we get we're
[18:29] into now uh we're going to read in
[18:32] Malachi 4 about the Prophet Elijah
[18:34] coming we're living in that
[18:37] day listen we're not people say we're
[18:40] living in Bible times hold on a minute
[18:43] you didn't come in here in a
[18:45] horse carriage and you didn't go home to
[18:48] a cave or a thatched
[18:51] house no you're living the Bible
[18:55] time you're living what it said and I
[18:58] know some of us bad rich increas with
[19:00] Goods have need of nothing and all that
[19:01] stuff but still we are living what the
[19:04] Bible's always been looking for is this
[19:07] group of people right
[19:08] here do you know one thing for
[19:11] sure you are one of the five wise
[19:18] virgins who's it talking about they went
[19:20] to Rapture they that us so there were
[19:24] identified right there in the Bible just
[19:25] in one little scripture we'll read some
[19:27] more maybe a little bit later so let's
[19:29] bow our heads dear heavenly father thank
[19:30] you for this day you've give us thank
[19:32] you for this time Lord that we have we
[19:33] pray that you would be with the ones
[19:34] that are not here that are sick Lord
[19:37] just bless the ones that are sin sick
[19:38] father and bring them into fold be with
[19:40] the ones Lord that are traveling Lord in
[19:41] different ones father we pray that you'd
[19:43] just bless us now anoint the word
[19:45] through the people's ears in Jesus name
[19:48] amen we're still on transition to
[19:50] Perfection all right we're on part six
[19:53] and I think we got this thing
[19:55] working man said one time a man named
[19:57] Toby Mack everybody know who Toby Mack
[19:59] is most of you that listen to
[20:01] contemporary Christian music he said
[20:03] practice the pause when in doubt pause
[20:07] when you're angry pause when you're
[20:10] tired pause when you're stressed pause
[20:14] and when you pause
[20:17] pray good thing to do not just jump
[20:21] in right pause and then pray so let's
[20:25] read Malachi 4 very familiar but we're
[20:27] going to break it down a little bit
[20:28] today for behold the day cometh that
[20:30] shall burn as an oven and all the proud
[20:32] ye all that do wickedly shall be
[20:33] stubbled and the day that cometh shall
[20:35] burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts
[20:38] that it shall lead them neither root nor
[20:39] Branch now this is the last
[20:41] prophet to the Old Testament there's 400
[20:45] years between him and Jesus or John the
[20:47] Baptist all right there's going to be
[20:48] 400 years but this is what the Jewish
[20:52] people even of this day right here are
[20:54] looking for Elijah because that's what
[20:57] this says right here not knowing that
[20:59] they missed the Messiah they missed this
[21:02] Elijah but when that Elijah that the
[21:04] spirit of come from here that goes over
[21:05] the into the for the Jews for the
[21:07] 144,000 he's going to take this message
[21:10] and they're going to see that Elijah
[21:12] anointing all right and they're going to
[21:14] accept him but unto you that fear my
[21:16] name shall the son of righteousness rise
[21:18] with healing in his wings so there had
[21:20] to be a healing campaign to start this
[21:22] out and you shall go forth and grow up
[21:24] grow up you shall mature under this
[21:27] ministry as calvs of the stall and you
[21:30] shall tread down the wicked for they
[21:32] shall be ashes Under The Souls of your
[21:33] feet in the day that I shall do this
[21:35] sayth the Lord of hosts remember ye the
[21:37] law of Moses my servant which I
[21:39] commanded unto him in for all
[21:41] Israel with the statutes and judgments
[21:43] because remember this is Malachi coming
[21:44] out of the Old Testament into the new
[21:46] they don't know anything about a messiah
[21:48] they know he's coming they've got a few
[21:50] characteristics but they thought he was
[21:52] just going to come and take over they
[21:53] were going to kill all he was going to
[21:54] kill all the Romans and they were going
[21:55] to set up a kingdom right cuz that's
[21:58] what they kept asking him are you going
[21:59] to set up the kingdom now it was a wrong
[22:01] Kingdom right so behold I will send you
[22:04] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[22:06] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[22:07] so see it the Jews are reading this
[22:10] because they read the Old Testament they
[22:11] don't do they don't read the New
[22:12] Testament but they read the Old
[22:13] Testament the Torah so they're reading
[22:15] this they're looking for
[22:17] Elijah before the great and dead
[22:19] Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall
[22:20] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[22:22] children now we know who was that that
[22:23] was John the Baptist everybody with me
[22:27] father's Old Testament fathers New
[22:29] Testament young people brand new
[22:31] ministry brand new
[22:33] message right
[22:36] Christians and the Heart of the
[22:38] children to the
[22:41] fathers brother brandom or Elijah number
[22:44] four lest I come and smite the Earth
[22:47] with a curse you may be seated so they
[22:49] are looking for an Elijah to come on the
[22:51] scene before God curses this Earth all
[22:55] right but we know one thing for sure
[22:58] he's
[23:00] here brought his message and left all
[23:04] right and now Revelations 10:7 but in
[23:08] the days of the voice of the seventh
[23:11] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[23:13] mystery remember that's not plural the
[23:15] mystery of God should be finished as he
[23:17] has declared to his servants the
[23:20] prophets so this man the seventh angel
[23:23] messenger has to be on the earth at this
[23:27] time and he has to be a prophet all
[23:31] right not only a church aged messenger
[23:34] but a prophet there were many Church
[23:35] aged Messengers that were not prophets
[23:37] identified in the word like brother
[23:39] brandom everybody with me so now let's
[23:41] go to Zechariah
[23:43] 4:5 we'll try to get finished here by 12
[23:46] and then we'll have our our time back
[23:47] again but that um make sure everybody
[23:50] changed their clocks I didn't see
[23:51] everybody got here so let's good the
[23:53] angel that Tau with me answered and said
[23:55] unto me knowest thou not what these be
[23:58] and I said no my Lord These Old
[24:00] Testament people they didn't have the
[24:03] Holy
[24:03] Ghost they didn't have the baptism of
[24:05] Holy Ghost to lead them and guide them
[24:07] into all truth right they had an
[24:11] anointing that was true that would come
[24:13] on them and come off of them and cut
[24:14] them on them and come off of them come
[24:15] on David prophesying the first person
[24:18] right they pierced my hands and my feet
[24:21] and but but that anointing could come
[24:22] off of him and he would be just a normal
[24:25] person he'd commit adultery commit
[24:28] murder and all these different things
[24:30] all right but that's what was coming
[24:31] though this new message is that God's
[24:34] going to live inside of you not just on
[24:36] you as an anointing is going to live
[24:37] inside of
[24:39] you then he answered and spake unto me
[24:42] saying I said he said no my Lord this is
[24:44] the word of the Lord unto zerubabel now
[24:47] zerubabel was a
[24:49] builder right in the Old Testament
[24:52] actually the word zerubabel
[24:55] means out of Babel out of Babel
[25:00] so where did Brother brandham come from
[25:02] he came right out of Babel this is
[25:05] Babel and that's why he stood and said
[25:08] come out of her my
[25:10] people he brought him out by the new
[25:13] birth and gave him a message gave him an
[25:15] angel gave him gave him a sign gave us a
[25:18] sign and then he said okay let's not
[25:21] follow the sign of the person follow
[25:22] Jesus Christ cuz he's back all right so
[25:25] come out of her my people so come out of
[25:27] her he was in in it he wasn't of the
[25:29] world now remember he was a sinner just
[25:30] like the rest of us all right is
[25:31] everybody with me he was not God that's
[25:34] right he was born of sex he made
[25:38] mistakes he had to eat he got sick he
[25:42] was a
[25:43] daddy father everybody understand that
[25:47] he wasn't Immaculate there was no
[25:49] Immaculate Conception except
[25:51] one so the Bible tells us in zeru that
[25:55] zerubabel being this great Builder that
[25:58] now zachariah's going to tell zerubabel
[26:00] said look he answered and spake unto me
[26:02] saying now this is the Angel talking to
[26:04] zerubabel this is the word of the Lord
[26:06] or talking to u to Zachariah all right
[26:09] so this is the word of the Lord unto
[26:11] zerubabel so the word of the Lord came
[26:12] to zerubabel saying not by might not by
[26:16] power but by my spirit sayith the Lord
[26:18] of hosts who out thou oh great Mountain
[26:22] before zerubabel Thou shalt become a
[26:24] plain in other words he had to start
[26:26] somewhere and build up to this Mountain
[26:29] so it's going to be a plane when he gets
[26:31] here it's going to be flat all
[26:33] denominations were flat when brother
[26:35] Brown got here you understand what I'm
[26:36] saying this is a little bit of tip this
[26:37] is what I say Bible days but now that
[26:40] Bible days is correct is to me and you
[26:42] because we're supposed to take the
[26:44] message and now Build That Mountain yes
[26:47] right there's not a real zable here
[26:49] brother ROM's not here that's right we
[26:52] have Mighty Men though that can build
[26:54] this thing that can build the temple
[26:56] back not the temple over there in Israel
[26:58] but the temple right here sir all right
[27:00] everybody with me and he shall bring
[27:02] forth The Headstone so there is your
[27:05] identification that that zerubabel is
[27:08] our last seventh day messenger cuz no
[27:10] one brought the headstone message except
[27:13] William Mar brandom no one pieces parts
[27:17] I'll agree with you the whole bringing
[27:19] of The Headstone
[27:21] uhuh only one man and you and I are
[27:25] under that
[27:27] message to her messenger she will be the
[27:30] final voice to the final
[27:33] age listen everything we do is
[27:36] final everything we do now remember God
[27:39] moves on and goes to Israel but
[27:40] everything we do in this Gentile
[27:42] dispensation is over when we leave this
[27:45] place right no one else will be
[27:48] saved I listened to a um a minister the
[27:52] other day I I watched listened to the
[27:54] Moody Bible Institute cuz this big time
[27:56] in Chattanooga and green and Nashville
[27:58] so when I'm going to the to the uh
[28:01] hunting camp I turn them on and listen
[28:03] and they they one brother he did the
[28:05] best he could they asked him about
[28:07] certain things and you could tell it was
[28:09] denominational because he didn't
[28:11] understand he didn't understand he was
[28:13] putting us into tribulation and being
[28:14] able to get saved now that's their
[28:16] Doctrine y'all know that I hope you know
[28:18] that now right the doctrine is if you
[28:21] don't make it you're a Baptist if you
[28:23] don't make it you got another chance to
[28:25] make it into the you know when you in
[28:27] the tribulation
[28:28] and all he had the souls under the altar
[28:30] being tribulation people and thank God
[28:32] for a prophet I didn't sit there and I
[28:35] didn't sit there and criticize a man but
[28:37] I said Hallelujah yes sir I know what
[28:40] you were talking about Lord cuz you sent
[28:42] me a prophet to tell us exactly who the
[28:45] souls under the altar are where do we go
[28:47] in the not in the tri we're not going to
[28:49] be in the tribulation where are we going
[28:50] to be we're going to be in
[28:52] glory so there he's going to bring forth
[28:54] The Headstone Now who is the head of the
[28:57] church Jesus Christ is the head of the
[29:00] church so he's going to bring Jesus
[29:02] Christ in power back to the Earth again
[29:05] by the word of God not bringing back
[29:07] physical right all right therefore
[29:12] shouting crying what Grace and that's
[29:14] what I was thanking God I said Lord
[29:15] thank God for grace that you gave me a
[29:20] message not criticizing the man he was
[29:22] doing he was stumbling through that it
[29:24] was a it was a a questions and answers
[29:26] they call in and say hey what about this
[29:27] what this
[29:29] and probably 50% of the questions he
[29:32] answered wrong but he answered he said
[29:35] that's he said that's all I know they
[29:38] asked him about where we're going to be
[29:39] he he said that when we got into
[29:41] tribulation period there would be a
[29:42] there would be some kind of transition
[29:44] for us to get in the Millennium but he
[29:46] never answered it he said well I'll just
[29:49] leave that up to God well that's okay
[29:51] but God sent us a message and God spoke
[29:54] to us and told us what these things are
[29:56] all right moreover the word of the Lord
[29:59] came unto me saying the hands of
[30:01] zerubabel have laid the foundation of
[30:04] this house his hands shall also finish
[30:08] it what is his hands his hands is his
[30:11] workmen you work with your hands right
[30:14] we are his workmen Made In His Image so
[30:18] zerubabel is not here in type brother
[30:21] ROM was Rubble I hope you understand
[30:23] that he laid the foundation but then his
[30:25] hands shall finish it which is us the
[30:28] laborers the ones that are still here
[30:30] and thou shalt know that the Lord of
[30:32] hosts hath sent me unto you we know God
[30:35] sent us a prophet I hope you
[30:38] do for who H has despised the day of
[30:41] small things for they shall rejoice
[30:46] they they is
[30:50] you so let's say I shall rejoice let's
[30:54] say I shall rejoice are we rejoicing cuz
[30:59] God sent us a prophet he sent us as a
[31:02] rable he sent us a master builder put
[31:04] the foundation down and say all right
[31:07] guys build
[31:09] it I'm not waiting for Brother Brown to
[31:11] come back and build it you'll be left
[31:14] here with the 10 foolish virgin five
[31:15] foolish virgins now watch this right
[31:18] here and they shall
[31:20] rejoice and shall see the plummet in the
[31:24] hand of
[31:26] zerubabel now I I know um some of y'all
[31:29] are not old enough but when when I used
[31:32] to watch them old men build houses and
[31:34] so did Brother Gary it was called a plum
[31:37] Bob right had a piece of lead that had a
[31:41] that had that was sharp almost looked
[31:43] like a top a spinning top you understand
[31:45] what I'm saying and it was made of lead
[31:47] really heavy you put it on a string and
[31:50] you would take that string and if you
[31:51] wanted to start a start a corner or take
[31:54] a corner a point it wasn't laser like we
[31:57] do now you just laser shoot it you had
[31:59] to literally put that well what happened
[32:01] that plummet was straight that's the
[32:03] straightest you could get right at the
[32:06] time that was it remember brother Dell
[32:08] telling us how a long time ago men used
[32:09] to they didn't have levels so they put
[32:11] water in the Floor of a house to make
[32:14] sure that it was level that the floor
[32:15] was level what we come to now we just we
[32:19] got to level I got to level on my
[32:22] phone among other things but but
[32:25] zerubabel was sent
[32:28] with a plummet in his hand in other
[32:31] words to get it all straight you got to
[32:32] have a
[32:34] plummet or we called him a plum Bob
[32:36] that's right which would be something
[32:38] that you hang down it had to be straight
[32:41] it couldn't be crooked it had to be
[32:42] straight and what you do is is you'd put
[32:44] get it right to the ground and you just
[32:46] sometimes I've watched them just touch
[32:47] the ground and there's the point
[32:49] sticking down there's the point make a
[32:51] divot in the ground right brother Gary
[32:53] that kind of put the divot in the ground
[32:55] and that's where you started from so
[32:57] thank God he sent us a prophet with a
[32:59] plummet in his hand all right so let's
[33:02] look at this just for a minute with
[33:04] these seven that's what I said this is
[33:06] not Bible times this is Bible being made
[33:09] real to me and you all right with those
[33:12] seven they are the eyes of the Lord
[33:14] which run to and fro through the whole
[33:16] earth so let's look at these points
[33:18] remember the zerubu meant sown in
[33:21] Babylon all right so he come out of
[33:23] Babylon he came out of the Baptist
[33:25] Church he came out of denominations
[33:29] right and brought us a message and this
[33:32] man is going to bring the headstone
[33:33] something no one else has done before
[33:35] ever even even brother Paul as great as
[33:37] he is he did not bring us The Headstone
[33:40] message he could look at it he could
[33:42] look at the glass Darkly he could see
[33:44] something but he could not put it
[33:46] together you know why cuz you and I were
[33:48] not there to feed on it remember God's
[33:51] not going to cast his bread Before Swine
[33:52] he's not going he said whatever I preach
[33:54] in other words if I cast it it's going
[33:56] to come back well it's got to fall in
[33:58] the right people first that's right so
[34:01] I'm telling you
[34:02] folks this is all we
[34:06] got World ain't going to make us
[34:09] better this is the only thing that's
[34:11] going to Rapture us is this message of
[34:13] the hour nothing else right nothing
[34:16] else so the word hands like I said
[34:19] before means power I even looked it up
[34:21] that word you know that the right hand
[34:23] mean or the hands means power so
[34:25] zerubabel was going to have the power to
[34:27] to build and then the power to hand it
[34:29] to somebody by hand hand it to somebody
[34:32] and then use a plummet a plummet is a
[34:34] leveling tool so what did Brother random
[34:37] do when he came here he leveled the word
[34:39] up the word wasn't off man was off man
[34:44] got off even got off that whole
[34:46] Foundation man got off of it everybody
[34:50] with me so now let's go to First Kings
[34:52] I've quoted this the other day but just
[34:55] for something short we'll um
[35:00] you know brother Bown said one time he
[35:01] said if you can't read read every verse
[35:03] and see Christ Now where's
[35:06] Christ Christ is in
[35:08] you Christ is in you so if you can't see
[35:11] you in every verse something the good
[35:13] and the
[35:15] bad but the
[35:17] good watch this and it came to pass when
[35:20] midday was passed now what
[35:22] happened Elijah is on the scene first
[35:25] first Elijah was on the scene he makes a
[35:27] challenge
[35:29] come on up here and let's see if Ba's
[35:32] God or let's see if God be God the god
[35:34] of Israel or the god of baale one of the
[35:36] two which we're going to have a showdown
[35:38] right here on top of this mountain
[35:41] remember brother R said we would have a
[35:42] showdown in the end time it'd be on
[35:44] Mount Transfiguration amen Mount Zion I
[35:47] mean which is us and it came to pass
[35:50] when midday was passed all Church Ages
[35:53] were over right midday we're not in the
[35:56] middle of church ages
[35:58] were in the evening time yes so they
[36:01] fought and they cut each other and they
[36:03] it was a horrible
[36:05] scene and they prophesied until the time
[36:08] of the offering of the evening sacrifice
[36:12] yes are we not in evening time oh
[36:15] yes now they had got so where they
[36:18] couldn't even talk that there was
[36:20] neither voice nor any to answer nor any
[36:24] that regarded there was nothing
[36:26] happening all Church ages nothing
[36:29] happening they actually jumped up on the
[36:33] Altar and pitched such a fit they tore
[36:36] it all down the altar was scattered
[36:38] everywhere right a safe space I didn't
[36:41] read that but you'll go up a little bit
[36:42] higher you can read that and Elijah said
[36:44] unto all the people come near unto me
[36:47] and all the people came near unto him
[36:49] and he repaired the altar that was
[36:51] broken down brother randam started with
[36:55] the just shall live by faith he went to
[36:58] Wesley's message Pentecost and then he
[37:00] brought his message but he didn't deny
[37:02] all that other amen but he did tell
[37:05] those Pentecostals he said look you got
[37:07] your church order wrong Baptist you got
[37:09] your church order wrong all your
[37:11] different ones you got your church order
[37:12] wrong you're doing this you're doing
[37:14] that this is the way to do it that was
[37:16] he was a repairer of the altar of God
[37:19] which what is in Your Heart Right and
[37:22] all of us obviously were broken down and
[37:25] Elijah took 12 Stones according to the
[37:27] number the tribes of the sons of Jacob
[37:29] unto whom the word of the Lord came and
[37:31] saying Israel shall be thy name and with
[37:34] the stones now what is a stone a stone
[37:35] is a
[37:36] revelation so he takes these Revelations
[37:39] and he puts them
[37:41] together and God's not going to show up
[37:43] until he
[37:44] does he hasn't showed up
[37:47] already right right now
[37:51] watch he built the altar in the name of
[37:54] the Lord and he made a trench about the
[37:56] altars great as would contain two
[37:57] measures of
[37:59] seed that's that's us and he put the
[38:02] wood in order he didn't just throw it up
[38:05] there he put the wood in order cut the
[38:07] bulock in pieces and laid him on the
[38:10] wood and said fill four barrels with
[38:13] water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice
[38:15] and on the
[38:18] wood four barrels of
[38:21] water justification sanctification the
[38:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that
[38:25] Elijah brings us the word amen he's
[38:27] fixing the water the fire's going to
[38:29] fall but there's water going to be there
[38:31] which is me and you washing of the Water
[38:34] by the what by the
[38:36] word he wanted to make sure they didn't
[38:39] have a they didn't have a issue with
[38:42] well that was a real dry sacrifice so it
[38:44] just got consumed no he wanted to wet
[38:45] her down he wanted to make sure that it
[38:48] was
[38:49] impossible that's right impossible to
[38:52] dispute that's why brother random I
[38:54] believe when he started the healing
[38:55] campaign he wanted to he wanted the
[38:57] people people to see without disputation
[39:00] that he was the prophet in the end time
[39:02] but not so much say I'm your Prophet
[39:04] that's right he wanted the people to
[39:06] realize it listen you got to realize it
[39:08] for
[39:10] yourself he said do it the second
[39:14] time second
[39:16] pull and he did do it a third time sir
[39:19] and he did it the third time now when
[39:20] the third pull come guess what's fixing
[39:22] to happen fire is fixing to fall and the
[39:25] water R around the Altar and he filled
[39:27] the trm with water it came to pass now
[39:29] watch at the time of the offering of the
[39:32] evening sacrifice so in the evening time
[39:33] is when this happens amen that Elijah
[39:36] the prophet came near and said Lord God
[39:38] of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be
[39:40] known this day that thou art God in
[39:42] Israel and that I am thy servant yes and
[39:46] that I have done these things at Thy
[39:49] word remember brother Brown preached at
[39:51] Thy word
[39:52] Lord he did it at Thy word he did
[39:54] exactly what God told him yes hear me oh
[39:59] Lord hear me that this people may know
[40:01] that thou art the Lord God and thou H
[40:03] has turned their heart back again he's
[40:05] identifying who he is and he's
[40:08] identifying there's a group of people
[40:09] that's going to have their heart turned
[40:11] back they're going to be able to worship
[40:12] right they're going to be able to
[40:13] sacrifice the right way if that don't
[40:16] excite you then you need to find a good
[40:18] ball game or
[40:19] something then the fire of the Lord fell
[40:21] and
[40:24] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[40:28] wood and the stone and the dust and
[40:32] licked up the water that was in the
[40:34] trench we took a
[40:38] Rapture there was not the left brother
[40:40] Dy there was a whole bunch of stuff
[40:41] there there was a whole bunch of stuff
[40:43] here yeah but when God got finished when
[40:47] brother randam finished his message and
[40:49] then somebody picked that message up the
[40:52] fire of this message which is the
[40:54] ministers and the and the Ley of the
[40:56] message it takes this and puts you to
[40:57] our heart and burns out all the junk
[40:59] inside come on somebody and he's going
[41:02] to what he's going to consume you listen
[41:05] we're consumed with everything
[41:08] else but the word of
[41:10] God we're consumed with this or that or
[41:12] the other but we need to be consumed
[41:16] with the fire of God and if you got the
[41:18] Holy Ghost guess what listen they didn't
[41:20] leave a thing they AR going to leave
[41:22] ain't one bride going to be left here
[41:24] and we're going to leave this place
[41:26] because of brother ROM's message we're
[41:29] going to leave this place because God
[41:30] has revealed not that brother random was
[41:32] a prophet that should be already settled
[41:36] but that what he said was a Vindicated
[41:39] word directly from the mind of God
[41:42] knowing what to do with it he said
[41:44] she'll know she has her his potential
[41:46] not brother berner's potential Jesus
[41:48] Christ
[41:54] potential Joshua stood there and the
[41:56] Lord said said Joshua thy servant Moses
[41:59] is
[42:00] gone he's
[42:02] dead right but Joshua didn't just curl
[42:05] up on the side of the road and just
[42:07] start crying and stick his thumb in his
[42:10] mouth because God said as I was with
[42:13] Moses I'll be with you as I was with
[42:17] brother brandom I believe he's going to
[42:18] be with his
[42:19] people cuz we're the Joshua of the day
[42:21] we're the we're the Holy Ghost that's
[42:23] going to take us out over into the
[42:24] promised
[42:25] land right that's are tight that's right
[42:28] that's right all right now Matthew 17:9
[42:31] and as they came down from the mountain
[42:32] Jesus charged them saying tell the
[42:34] vision to no man I had been up on the
[42:35] mountain Moses and Elijah had appeared
[42:37] to him um brother R said they told him
[42:40] about his second coming all right so
[42:42] he's come down off the mountain the
[42:44] three um Peter James and John they see
[42:47] this and then they started you know well
[42:49] this just build an altar for all these
[42:50] people no Jesus wanted to build an altar
[42:53] in them right Jesus didn't come to build
[42:55] an altar
[42:57] not a physical altar he came to build an
[42:59] altar in me and you that's the reason
[43:01] that God couldn't get into your altar in
[43:03] the Old
[43:04] Testament there was nothing but bulls
[43:06] and goats to cover your sin it couldn't
[43:08] take it away so God won't dwell in an
[43:11] unclean vessel sure he's anointed them
[43:13] sure at the day that he died he saved
[43:15] those people in the Old Testament come
[43:17] on somebody Elijah's not going to be in
[43:20] Hell Samson's not going to be in Hell
[43:23] sir they're going to be in heaven but
[43:25] they're not going to be bride that's
[43:27] right there is no bride in the Old
[43:30] Testament not a gentile one now remember
[43:33] he had a bride Israel and he divorced
[43:35] her put her away to marry a gentile
[43:39] bride we're going to be the ones in
[43:41] incapacity and I mean get stay in the
[43:43] city the great Elijah the great Abraham
[43:47] the great
[43:49] Moses if they're bble to live in that
[43:51] City then it's something set aside for
[43:53] him because brother Brown said that city
[43:55] was made just for the bride
[43:57] right amen Moses is not
[44:00] bride Elijah is not bride Malachi is not
[44:06] bride they spoke of a bride they spoke
[44:09] of a bride that's why I said we're
[44:11] living the time now we're not just
[44:13] living in Bible days that has become
[44:15] alive in me and you right
[44:17] now it's our day yes to make that
[44:20] manifest
[44:22] amen Matthew says okay and says tell the
[44:25] vision to know man in other words don't
[44:27] tell anybody what you
[44:28] saw cuz they're not going to be able to
[44:30] understand it until the son of man be
[44:32] risen again from the dead and his
[44:35] disciples asked him saying why then
[44:37] shall the scri now why then say those
[44:40] disciples are going right back to the
[44:42] scripture I just read
[44:46] you they go right back to Malachi
[44:48] because they read Malachi remember
[44:49] Malachi was in the Old Testament and the
[44:52] disciples said why then say the scribes
[44:53] that Elish must first come they're
[44:55] actually quoting Malachi for
[44:59] okay and Jesus answered and said unto
[45:01] them Elias truly shall first come and
[45:05] restore all things now stop right here
[45:08] John the Baptist didn't do that right
[45:11] that's right right he was the hinge pin
[45:14] between the Old and New Testament and he
[45:15] introduced the
[45:17] Messiah he didn't straighten anybody out
[45:20] he tried one time and got his head
[45:22] chopped off for it so Jesus this by
[45:25] Revelation you can see that he said
[45:27] you're not going to understand this
[45:29] until the son of man be risen again in
[45:31] the end time remember they killed him
[45:33] through denominational ideas brother R
[45:36] said you crucified him again amen
[45:40] remember he indicted this whole
[45:41] generation he indicted the Baptist
[45:44] Methodist Pentecostals he said you
[45:46] killed Jesus Christ and put him out on
[45:47] the cross amen that's right that's the
[45:50] problem with they can't get him off the
[45:51] cross and get him inside of oh yeah
[45:53] Jesus died we know that beautiful
[45:55] wonderful
[45:57] he's got to get inside of you
[45:59] first for him to do any good Jesus
[46:02] answered and said Elias truly shall
[46:04] first come and restore all things now
[46:06] he's talking to me and you yes sir this
[46:09] is the day that Elijah that Elijah cuz
[46:12] watch what he said right here in just a
[46:14] minute that Elijah right there but I say
[46:16] unto you that Elias is come already now
[46:20] he's talking about John the Baptist CU
[46:22] physically they know him they see him
[46:24] he's right there they know he's a little
[46:26] bit weird he eats a little bit his
[46:27] diet's a little
[46:29] weird but he introduced the Messiah he
[46:32] introduced in other words the disciple
[46:34] says hey we know that's John John
[46:36] introduced us to you but what did
[46:39] Brother random do he didn't introduce us
[46:40] to
[46:41] himself he introduced us to Jesus Christ
[46:45] then we came out of the
[46:47] prison amen thank you
[46:51] Lord but I say unto you that Elias has
[46:53] come already and they knew him not
[46:58] but have done unto him
[47:00] whatsoever the original says that was
[47:03] listed likewise shall also the son of
[47:05] man suffer of what now who did who did
[47:08] the son of man suffer from he suffered
[47:11] from the denominational world of the day
[47:14] amen he suffered from the scribes and
[47:17] Pharisees and caiaphus and high priests
[47:20] that's where he got it he suffered
[47:22] that's right so also the son of man
[47:23] suffer them so when the message comes
[47:25] back in the end time like it today we
[47:27] will suffer that kind of persecution you
[47:30] will suffer if you try to tell somebody
[47:33] about the truth of the message of the
[47:34] hour right you know there's no way I'm
[47:37] not going to cast my pearls against uh
[47:39] to the swine I'm not going to call that
[47:41] guy on the phone and try to give him a a
[47:43] f minute dissertation how wrong he
[47:47] was
[47:49] amen I'm just thankful in my heart and I
[47:51] pray God get him s what the the the the
[47:55] prayer should be God get him to somebody
[47:57] that can help him he was trying to help
[47:59] people and he was giving them the wrong
[48:01] answer they said oh great that's fine
[48:02] thank you he'd hang up next one the call
[48:04] and say what about this well yeah okay
[48:05] thank you and they just took and
[48:07] accepted it as as as what you know what
[48:10] God was saying and absolutely is not
[48:13] true we will not the bride will not see
[48:16] a speck of tribulation we'll be out of
[48:19] here by that time praise God's name
[48:24] forever don't worry about bomb
[48:30] falling his whole world is worried that
[48:32] somebody's going to press a
[48:37] button there's one button I want to
[48:39] press That's the eject
[48:42] button and I want to be like that
[48:44] sacrifice I want to be laid on the altar
[48:47] I want to be told that here comes the
[48:49] fire and I'm out of here the Bible even
[48:52] says that there wasn't even dust left
[48:55] aren't we not dust there won't even be
[48:57] dust left pieces and parts are you not
[49:00] going to be scattered around everywhere
[49:02] we're going as a
[49:04] whole we're going
[49:06] home it's going home time it's 100% it's
[49:11] going home
[49:14] time yes likewise shall also so the son
[49:17] of man suffer of them who's them the
[49:19] religious world then the disciples
[49:22] understood that he spake of them John
[49:23] the Baptist obviously that was their
[49:25] Revelation but our PR present day
[49:27] Revelation is that that was not the
[49:29] Elijah that was sent to
[49:31] us that Elijah was sent to them see what
[49:34] it says right there that
[49:36] Elijah that Elijah was sent to them cuz
[49:39] he's come already and they knew him not
[49:41] not but the scripture before that he's
[49:44] talking about brother brandham he's
[49:46] talking about Elijah number
[49:47] four cuz he didn't nobody restored all
[49:50] things except the Elijah in the end time
[49:53] that's right He restored everything back
[49:56] praise God God didn't send us God didn't
[49:59] send us a half message he didn't send us
[50:02] something to wonder about he sent us
[50:04] something to believe and then let that
[50:06] connect to what's in your soul and you
[50:08] got to be able to say that ain't nothing
[50:09] but the
[50:11] truth folks if then ain't the truth come
[50:16] on you can't find
[50:20] it you sit there and
[50:22] listen and I listened to that brother
[50:25] and he was some theologian he had some
[50:27] kind of doctor degree and he was from
[50:29] whatever College Moody Bible college or
[50:30] something like that and he' been taught
[50:32] those things right I'm like man all that
[50:36] learning and half what you're saying is
[50:42] false that's what we've come
[50:47] to now this messenger Malachi 4 in
[50:50] Revelations 10 is going to do two things
[50:52] we read this before but we're going to
[50:53] read it again because if you don't see
[50:55] that brother random had a transition
[50:58] from a Healing Ministry to a a to a
[51:01] Perfection Ministry or transition from
[51:03] partial to perfect then you've missed
[51:07] it and if you still think about all the
[51:09] healing you missed it
[51:11] again God has moved on through
[51:14] that he's moved into the healing of the
[51:18] Soul not so much the healing of the body
[51:20] I know God heals us every day we know
[51:22] that right but we're looking as I read
[51:24] y'all 100 quotes in the past sever
[51:26] months where brother R said not in the
[51:28] years of preparation you've missed
[51:30] you're majoring on a minor a minor is
[51:33] that first part of his
[51:35] ministry all right the major is what
[51:37] we're sitting in today we can't go
[51:41] back I'll promise you one thing if
[51:44] William brandham stood in this pull pit
[51:45] right here there'd be no more people
[51:47] than they are today come
[51:50] on cuz you know what they'll say well I
[51:52] don't think it's him well it looks like
[51:55] him but might not be him
[51:57] well what he's saying is he's saying
[51:58] that we're all wrong well that's not
[52:00] Willam brandom then out the door you go
[52:03] hello
[52:05] somebody well brother Brown was here I'd
[52:07] get healed you're a weak Christian
[52:10] absolute weakest there ever was in in
[52:12] your life you're as weak as you can be
[52:15] if you think brother Brandon's going to
[52:16] heal you by coming back sir sir no I'm
[52:19] sorry it may it may uh rub your feathers
[52:22] but guess what I'm not waiting around
[52:24] for somebody to come back except Jesus
[52:27] Christ to pick me up amen cuz nobody can
[52:31] change your body except Jesus Christ now
[52:34] the message of the hour plus you is
[52:37] going to get us out of here it's going
[52:38] to change our
[52:40] body so one according to Malachi four he
[52:43] will turn the hearts of the children to
[52:44] the fathers Pentecostal babies to mature
[52:47] adult Christians all right cuz you know
[52:50] brother Brown brother brand brother Dell
[52:52] told us years and years and years God's
[52:53] not going to Rapture babies amen the
[52:58] body change is not going to come to
[53:00] babies it's going to come to somebody
[53:02] that knows how to handle the word of
[53:05] God and if it means sitting here and
[53:07] listening and praying and reading your
[53:09] Bible that's the only way I know you're
[53:11] going to get
[53:13] it so that first part he going to turn
[53:16] the hearts of the children what go in
[53:18] among the Pentecostal
[53:20] babies bring a healing Campaign which is
[53:23] the bait on the hook but they just got
[53:26] the bait and left the hook yes the hook
[53:29] was is to bring them into this second
[53:32] part but guess what didn't
[53:34] happen you know why the fish that he
[53:38] needed to catch is sitting here right
[53:42] now the fish he wanted to catch was not
[53:45] in there now there might be some of you
[53:46] sister cing someone been in meetings
[53:48] before but I'm not talking about that I
[53:49] ain't talking about being in a place
[53:52] physically I'm talking about in
[53:54] spiritual
[53:55] form you you can be 90 years old and be
[53:57] a
[54:01] baby praise the Lord
[54:04] anyhow age has nothing to do with
[54:08] Revelation I believe God can speak to
[54:10] these young people and give them
[54:12] Revelation that will help them dur their
[54:14] during their daily journey and it don't
[54:17] have to come from Mom and Daddy now I
[54:18] know Mom and listen Mom and Daddy's got
[54:20] to be your head that my that that we
[54:21] have a headship don't tell me that don't
[54:23] tell me kids that you can go over here
[54:25] and say now now God spoke to me and told
[54:27] me I could have a
[54:28] tattoo now let's go back over to
[54:31] Leviticus and talk about marking your
[54:32] body with ink all right put it back in
[54:35] the word kids if you can put in the word
[54:37] of God we'll deal with it but if it's
[54:40] just some thought you
[54:42] got I'm talking you adults
[54:45] too number two he will reveal the
[54:48] mysteries of the seven Thunders we're
[54:50] going to get into all that we're going
[54:51] to get into all the major doctrines here
[54:53] pretty
[54:55] quick it's coming up cold weather and
[54:58] now the times changed and y'all won't
[55:01] have so much to do maybe you start
[55:02] coming to
[55:04] church two he will reveal the mysteries
[55:07] of the seven thunders in Revelations 10
[55:09] which are the revelations contained in
[55:12] the Seven Seals now the Seven Seals were
[55:14] sealed
[55:15] up right right why were it sealed up cuz
[55:20] God over here in the
[55:22] beginning gave that book to Adam amen
[55:26] amen and the ability to open it right
[55:30] and that book has a book of names in it
[55:33] and it's mine and
[55:34] yours but when he couldn't do that when
[55:37] he had sex with Eve just be plain when
[55:40] he po when the womb was polluted first
[55:42] in her brain then him he accepted it and
[55:46] took a part of
[55:47] it or don't knock that over then he
[55:51] accepted it and sold out brother Brown
[55:52] said he sold me and you
[55:54] out he said he sold the whole human race
[55:57] out listen we blame Eve for a
[56:01] lot Adam was the one that sold us out
[56:05] that's the first Adam couldn't take us
[56:08] to Perfection I just got that the first
[56:11] Adam could not take us to Perfection he
[56:14] wasn't a savior he tried to be and en
[56:17] type he was cuz he saved Eve he took her
[56:20] and said no no no if you're going to
[56:21] kill her you got to kill me and know
[56:22] what Moses did Moses said if you're
[56:23] going to kill all them people you got to
[56:25] kill me first you got to come over me
[56:27] ain't what brother said about Abraham
[56:28] and Sarah God would have killed Sarah if
[56:30] it was for
[56:33] Abraham so sure Adam typed Christ but he
[56:35] wasn't Christ right we have Christ now
[56:38] folks we don't have an Adam first we
[56:40] have a second Adam it's going to take us
[56:42] out of
[56:44] here oh praise the
[56:46] Lord it will be be it will be these
[56:49] divinely not just revealed divinely
[56:53] revealed mystery truths that literally
[56:56] turn the hearts of the children to the
[56:58] pastal fathers that's why I said we are
[57:02] literally making the word of God
[57:05] manifest
[57:07] literally as I said before and you're
[57:10] not I know you don't get it some of you
[57:11] don't some of you do we're not a
[57:14] type that's
[57:16] right everything in the Bible types the
[57:20] bride everything types the
[57:23] real literal means real listen I'm not
[57:27] I'm not coming to
[57:34] church I'm standing in church I'm
[57:37] literally here you ain't got to guess
[57:40] you ain't got to wonder if I'm going to
[57:42] get here I'm standing here right now so
[57:45] guess what no more guessing about
[57:47] Revelation no more guessing about
[57:49] Mysteries no more being able say well
[57:51] that's your opinion that's my opinion
[57:53] Jesus Christ is the only opinion we need
[57:55] to have
[57:59] we're going to get it right or we're
[58:01] wrong you can't be in
[58:02] between that's right correct but
[58:06] consider this this Prophet Messenger
[58:09] will be in his nature and manner as Was
[58:11] Elijah and John the people of this now
[58:14] watch the people of this Prophet
[58:16] messenger's day that's me and
[58:19] you right will be as they were in ahab's
[58:22] day and in John's and since it is only
[58:25] the children whose Hearts will be turned
[58:27] it is only the children who will listen
[58:30] yes that's it you've heard about us old

[58:59] though you can change children you can
[59:02] influence children that's my brother of
[59:04] ROM was sent to children now you and I

[1:03:27] down with an open book in his hand is
[1:03:30] that not where we're at now
[1:03:33] right what he descend in the word the
[1:03:36] word that brother randam brought opened
[1:03:37] the veil so that Christ could come in
[1:03:39] and give it to the people amen a conduit
[1:03:43] that was used of God to bring it to the
[1:03:45] people so that you and I cannot be
[1:03:47] confused like we were before amen a
[1:03:51] shout what is the shout it's the message
[1:03:54] going forth first the living bread of
[1:03:57] life bringing forth the bride so there
[1:03:59] had to be a message come to bring a
[1:04:01] bride that could hear what's being said
[1:04:04] that can know what's fixing to happen
[1:04:06] and they can manifest what's going to
[1:04:09] happen Rapture
[1:04:11] again first thing comes when he starts
[1:04:14] descending from Heaven there's a shout
[1:04:16] what is it listen if I go stand over
[1:04:18] here somewhere outside and I open that
[1:04:20] door and I go hey what are y'all going
[1:04:23] to do everybody's going to turn their
[1:04:25] head you're not going to look that way
[1:04:26] that's right you're going to turn your
[1:04:28] head toward wherever that shout was
[1:04:30] that's right why because it what it gets
[1:04:32] the people's
[1:04:34] attention listen is a mess what is it
[1:04:37] it's a is a message to get the people
[1:04:40] together not separate us get us
[1:04:43] together a message comes forth first now
[1:04:46] lamp trimming time remember he's talking
[1:04:48] about the virgins rise and trim your
[1:04:50] lamps what watch was that the seventh
[1:04:54] not the sixth amen the seventh behold
[1:04:56] the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your
[1:04:59] lamps and they did some of them found
[1:05:02] they didn't even have any oil in their
[1:05:04] lamp but it's lamp trimming time it's
[1:05:07] Malachi four
[1:05:09] time what he proom is Luke 17 is Isaiah
[1:05:13] all these prophecies that it can that it
[1:05:15] can perfectly set in order for this day
[1:05:18] in the scriptures we see it
[1:05:21] living right
[1:05:23] there continue on
[1:05:26] now he's getting pretty personal right
[1:05:28] here now this is
[1:05:30] 1965 this is actually
[1:05:33] about 20 days before he before he died
[1:05:38] um or or close to it I think he had to W
[1:05:40] or he died on Christmas Eve so this is
[1:05:42] getting close 1204 1965 actually he was
[1:05:45] coming back from Arizona when he got
[1:05:47] killed so he was preaching this is his
[1:05:49] last part of his message when I went
[1:05:52] forth into the meetings with you praying
[1:05:53] for the sick it was fine
[1:05:57] but when I came with a message all
[1:06:01] right if any message Goes Forth it's a
[1:06:04] true message if it's the true genuine
[1:06:07] miracles of god and hangs right in that
[1:06:09] organization you know it's not of
[1:06:11] God cuz that thing is already declared
[1:06:14] in other words it's already
[1:06:16] cursed it's dead Jesus went forth and
[1:06:20] healed the sick in order to catch their
[1:06:22] eyes the people then his message that's
[1:06:25] right it has to have something that God
[1:06:28] is going to introduce amen
[1:06:32] right I'm asking you again is we know
[1:06:35] the first part of the message has been
[1:06:36] introduced to us the healings and the
[1:06:38] signs and the Wonders and all that it's
[1:06:41] undisputable right but when we get into
[1:06:43] that second
[1:06:45] part people
[1:06:47] dispute cuz if you don't have the
[1:06:49] revelation of the son of man you'll not
[1:06:51] see it amen
[1:06:55] cuz Kus and them they were very
[1:06:57] religious and they didn't see it listen
[1:06:59] the 12 disciples or the 11 didn't know
[1:07:02] who Judas was except for the son of man
[1:07:04] he the only one who knew who it
[1:07:06] was amen his miracles like just catch
[1:07:09] the eyes of the people the main heart of
[1:07:12] it is the
[1:07:13] message that's what is there's what is
[1:07:16] what comes from in here he's trying to
[1:07:19] get the favor of the people so they'll
[1:07:21] sit and listen to him for there's some
[1:07:24] in there that's ordained
[1:07:26] to
[1:07:27] life so the shout is brother randam a
[1:07:30] messenger getting the people ready the
[1:07:33] second is a voice of a resurrection
[1:07:35] which is what the voice of the son of
[1:07:37] man because the son of man was standing
[1:07:39] there when he raised Lazarus from the
[1:07:40] dead and that was the voice of the son
[1:07:42] of man in other words the voice of the
[1:07:44] Resurrection same voice a loud voice in
[1:07:46] St John that called Lazarus from the
[1:07:49] grave and I put in parenthesis that's
[1:07:50] where the son of man was standing there
[1:07:52] amen getting the bride together then the
[1:07:54] resurrection of the the dead see to be
[1:07:56] caught up with it now watch these three
[1:07:58] things take place the next is what a
[1:08:00] trumpet a shout a voice and trumpet now
[1:08:03] the third thing is a trumpet which
[1:08:05] always at the Feast of the trumpet is
[1:08:07] calling the people to the feast and
[1:08:09] that'll be the bride supper the lamb
[1:08:12] supper with the bride in the sky so you
[1:08:14] and I are now listening to what the
[1:08:17] shout we've heard the message the voice
[1:08:20] of the Archangel is going to come
[1:08:21] through the bride it's got to
[1:08:24] right right
[1:08:29] at midnight there was a cry behold the
[1:08:30] bridegroom cometh go out to meet him now
[1:08:33] remember they all woke
[1:08:35] up all 10 woke
[1:08:37] up but five were ready and five were
[1:08:41] not then all those virgins Rose and
[1:08:44] trimmed the lamps and the foolish said
[1:08:45] un the wise give us over your oil for
[1:08:47] our lamps are gone
[1:08:48] out we didn't study like you did we
[1:08:51] didn't go to church like you did we
[1:08:52] didn't get the correct message like you
[1:08:54] did hello somebody
[1:08:56] and that what it is they got something
[1:08:57] wrong somewhere cuz they didn't make the
[1:09:00] Rapture if you don't make the Rapture
[1:09:02] you going to have something
[1:09:04] wrong and it's
[1:09:06] not God's
[1:09:10] fault and we know what
[1:09:12] happened proving his word let's read
[1:09:14] this one right
[1:09:17] here not no more as a church cuz the son
[1:09:20] of man is being revealed now watch not
[1:09:22] no more the bride is called see in that
[1:09:25] day the son of man will be revealed what
[1:09:27] to join the church to the Head unite the
[1:09:30] marriage of the Bride the bridegroom
[1:09:32] call will come right through this what
[1:09:34] through this message yes nothing else
[1:09:38] amen when the son of man will come down
[1:09:39] and come in human flesh to unite the two
[1:09:43] together your human flesh amen the
[1:09:48] church has to be the word he is the word
[1:09:51] and the two unites together and to do
[1:09:54] that it'll take the Manifest ation of
[1:09:55] the revealing of the son of man not a
[1:09:58] clergy right see it's the son of man
[1:10:01] Jesus Christ will come down in human
[1:10:03] flesh Among Us and will make his word so
[1:10:06] real that it'll unite the church in him
[1:10:08] as one the bride and then she'll go home
[1:10:10] to the wedding supper she's already
[1:10:12] United when you get born again you're
[1:10:14] you're we have a marriage marriage down
[1:10:15] here then we go to the supper all right
[1:10:18] everybody with me when the word here
[1:10:21] unites with the person and they two
[1:10:23] become one and then that and then what
[1:10:26] does it do then it manifests the son of
[1:10:28] man again not the church theologians the
[1:10:31] son of man the word in the church
[1:10:32] becomes one whatever the son of man done
[1:10:36] now if you want to know how the end time
[1:10:37] people act read Matthew Mark Luke and
[1:10:40] John that's what the son of man acted
[1:10:42] like CU it was him and he's our example
[1:10:45] whatever the son of man done he was the
[1:10:47] word and the church does the same thing
[1:10:51] amen let's stand to our
[1:10:53] feet come on musician just for a minute
[1:10:56] we'll sing a
[1:10:58] song He said look he says in the form of
[1:11:01] people not Son of God not son of David
[1:11:03] but son of man the Son of God was the
[1:11:07] supernatural what first part of his
[1:11:09] ministry was the son of God under the
[1:11:10] Son of God Ministry he was just bringing
[1:11:12] back the gifts he was just restoring
[1:11:14] what had been done for for years through
[1:11:16] prophets they had prophesied they had
[1:11:18] told people they had told dreams Daniel
[1:11:20] was a great dream teller and or revealer
[1:11:23] and so it was different ones uh
[1:11:28] but it wasn't just that it was the
[1:11:29] message that was behind that is what
[1:11:31] we're to catch but just before the
[1:11:33] promised son come God revealed himself
[1:11:35] as a man in human flesh and read the
[1:11:37] thoughts that was in Sarah's heart in
[1:11:39] the room behind him now if you just take
[1:11:41] that right there and read that he's
[1:11:42] saying he's the son of man but that's
[1:11:45] not right you know that as well as I do
[1:11:47] that's not right just before the
[1:11:49] promised son come God revealed himself
[1:11:51] as a man in human flesh yeah he's going
[1:11:53] to anytime Jesus is going to be be
[1:11:55] revealed in the end time it's got to be
[1:11:57] through me and you it's got to he picked
[1:11:59] it that way it's got to be through human
[1:12:00] flesh it's got to be through the bride
[1:12:03] in the end time when the son of man
[1:12:06] shall be revealed the son of man being
[1:12:07] revealed not the Son of God in the
[1:12:09] church
[1:12:10] age that's why we're done with the
[1:12:12] church age he's put out of that right
[1:12:15] now he's son of man reving himself the
[1:12:18] word is becoming flesh Among Us do you
[1:12:21] believe that let's sing a song
[1:12:27] Jesus is
[1:12:29] myi I shall not be
