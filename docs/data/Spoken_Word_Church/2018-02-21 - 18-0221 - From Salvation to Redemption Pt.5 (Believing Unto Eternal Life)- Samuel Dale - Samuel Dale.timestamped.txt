[1:06] everybody in the house of the Lord
[1:08] you'd like to turn in your Scripture and
[1:11] read along with us turn to Jonah 2 where
[1:14] we've been reading and then we'll go to
[1:16] mark 16 with Jonah two and mark 16 now
[1:22] remember the announcements that have
[1:24] been made member the Bible study will be
[1:27] the first Saturday in March so we'll
[1:29] keep that in mind and then the third
[1:32] Saturday will be the fellowship meeting
[1:34] and brother Ernie Villanueva will be
[1:37] ministering and it will be here so just
[1:40] get everything ready for that part and
[1:42] other announcements Terrence and then
[1:44] was made and just you know it's a great
[1:49] day and a great time to be able to serve
[1:53] on Almighty God and love him and know
[1:57] that He loves us in it amen
[1:59] if you got this turn to Jonah and just
[2:02] let's start from there I want to try to
[2:05] bring I'm trying to bring each thing as
[2:09] a thought instead of you know taking so
[2:13] much of this and this and this and is
[2:17] taking as a thought and then putting
[2:19] that thought down now in another week or
[2:22] maybe we'll just take a message and go
[2:26] all the way through from beginning to
[2:29] where we caught up to and try to you
[2:32] know maybe that'll help to understand
[2:35] but if you would just listen I'm just
[2:37] trying to make a thought you know or
[2:40] something and you know and just getting
[2:44] it lined up into that thought and with a
[2:46] prophet in the Bible and then we'll take
[2:48] it all together as one and it should
[2:52] line up pretty good to us and we get it
[2:55] all together father we thank you for
[2:57] your grace and your love we thank you
[3:00] for the day in the hour that we're
[3:02] living we thank you for grace and
[3:04] Calvary we ask you to just be with us
[3:07] you promised it so we can depend on it
[3:10] you said you'd be with us you send your
[3:13] word and heal us
[3:14] we thank you for all of the ones that
[3:16] have had these old flu bugs and things
[3:19] Lord and he you've come on the scene and
[3:21] took care of them where there would be a
[3:23] lot of sicknesses and high fevers and
[3:25] things and Lord in you you took care a
[3:28] lot of the things and kept it down among
[3:30] us and we praise you and thank you for
[3:32] that and we ask you to just have your
[3:35] way now and let us see you and to walk
[3:38] in the light of your love got us in
[3:41] Jesus name Amen
[3:44] remember that Wade will be going to
[3:49] Alabama this weekend so remember that
[3:52] and praise the Lord would bless them and
[3:54] a lot of the others brother Louise is
[3:56] going love the others are going so just
[3:59] be much in prayer okay Jonah 2 & 9 but I
[4:05] will sacrifice unto thee with the force
[4:07] of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I
[4:11] have vowed salvation is of the Lord now
[4:17] an odd point to pick up but I wanted to
[4:21] drive a thought into us tonight from
[4:25] this so we go to mark 16 and we'll begin
[4:29] at verse 14 afterward this is coming
[4:35] down and the resurrections and the
[4:37] different things that has taken place
[4:39] and then says afterward he appeared unto
[4:42] the eleven as they said it meat and
[4:44] upbraided them with their unbelief and
[4:47] hardness of heart now watch because they
[4:51] believe not them which had seen him
[4:54] after he was risen and they didn't
[4:57] believe the literal report of people
[5:00] that saw it okay now and he said unto
[5:03] them go into all the world and preach
[5:06] the gospel to every creature he that
[5:08] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[5:11] but he that believeth not shall be
[5:14] damned so you may be seated
[5:16] the Lord had two blessing to the reading
[5:19] of his word all right now we're staying
[5:23] with the point of
[5:27] you know we're trying to get it settled
[5:29] in our binds and talks about the Old
[5:34] Testament getting that in order getting
[5:37] the things laid out and then coming in
[5:40] to now in understanding and we still
[5:44] haven't got to actually preach about the
[5:47] new birth yet we're just leading up to
[5:49] it and you know trying to cover a few
[5:53] things maybe the Lord willing we'll pick
[5:55] it up Sunday and continue on all right
[5:59] but now what was art what has been our
[6:03] thoughts salvation is based upon the
[6:08] fact of whether or not you can believe
[6:12] all right now there are some people that
[6:15] cannot believe okay I mean there's some
[6:19] people that cannot do it it just it
[6:21] doesn't matter what you do they can't
[6:23] believe what now so that means as a
[6:27] people Dyer that is having a lot of
[6:30] trouble you know all right now see you
[6:33] got then in the church realm
[6:36] you've got the three basic believers you
[6:39] know to make believer the unbeliever in
[6:43] a true believer so everything is based
[6:46] and we tried the last message in this
[6:48] one is to bring it to a thought to her
[6:52] that we can look at how important it is
[6:56] to be able to believe it's really the
[7:05] most important thing you can think of
[7:08] and what about it to not be able to
[7:10] believe I mean what if you were just so
[7:12] cut out so set to a situation of life
[7:17] that you couldn't believe well then
[7:21] they're just no hope for you right I
[7:24] mean it's not based see it's based on
[7:28] whether or not remember what we've
[7:30] emphasized over and over it's based upon
[7:33] whether or not we can believe God is
[7:36] real
[7:39] Hebrews 11:6 what he that comes to God
[7:42] must believe that he is and that was see
[7:46] that won't work you got to believe he's
[7:48] real all right now then you got to come
[7:51] to John 6:44 that says no man can come
[7:56] unless the father draw him all right
[7:58] we've got to believe then that he has
[8:02] drawn us or called us or guided us you
[8:05] know like Abraham to the basis of as the
[8:08] emphases in the last message on Abraham
[8:11] not a great guy but just a man that
[8:13] believed God didn't do great signs and
[8:17] wonders to show him to start weird to
[8:19] get him to going he just believed him
[8:21] all right and he's called the father of
[8:24] faith so then we need to say well let me
[8:28] at least be that much you know all right
[8:33] then we talked about it and we from
[8:37] Romans two and four it says that the
[8:40] goodness of God is what leads you to
[8:43] repentance it's all right first you
[8:46] believe that he is then you believe that
[8:50] he has called you all right then you
[8:54] believe that his goodness has led you to
[8:57] repentance and brought you to a place to
[9:01] where you can believe God's Word so it's
[9:06] everything based on believing all right
[9:09] now the night we're gonna be talking
[9:11] about this believing of how valuable it
[9:15] is because you just think about it if
[9:23] you can't believe then you can't be
[9:29] saved
[9:31] now God can come down and do no he can
[9:35] not override your free moral agency all
[9:40] right so you got to believe it and you
[9:44] got to believe he's calling you you got
[9:46] to believe he's dealing with you you got
[9:48] to put it in do you believe in that's
[9:50] why we read that and there and then John
[9:52] back a little bit before then of John
[9:55] they come down to the disciples finally
[9:57] got to a play and they said well we now
[10:00] know that nobody don't have to teach you
[10:02] this or whatever tell you and he said do
[10:04] you now believe after all that was said
[10:11] and done the sick he or the dead raised
[10:14] all kinds of things he said do you now
[10:19] believe he had 70 ministers that walk
[10:24] with him but before Calvary they left
[10:29] him right why because they couldn't
[10:33] believe we talked about this past Sunday
[10:42] of talking on believing unto salvation
[10:48] believing unto believing unto salvation
[10:52] do you realize that you're believing
[10:55] then is what brings God to you sure he
[11:03] lays it down in front of you the
[11:04] goodness called etc but you really
[11:07] realize that you're and you're believing
[11:12] that that brings God to you well you
[11:17] know that's a wonderful thought at least
[11:21] enough to even think about that you
[11:24] could believe enough that God could come
[11:27] to you that's wonderful in that you
[11:35] could believe enough now we won't get
[11:40] into it to say much about it but we'll
[11:43] mention it
[11:44] we're going to talk about believing and
[11:47] going on in your believing tonight
[11:50] and coming out to salvation and things
[11:56] but what we're going to lay it out in
[11:59] order cuz I want you to think on it
[12:04] now we believe in predestination right
[12:08] how do we believe that your
[12:10] predestinated according to the
[12:12] scriptures in the Prophet those who he
[12:16] foreknew he did predestinate well you
[12:21] know God knows every person and how much
[12:25] they can believe right remember we're
[12:28] taking the thought now with the
[12:30] predestination see he knows whether or
[12:33] not you'll believe and go on in your
[12:36] believing but he knows that some will
[12:39] believe except but they won't continue
[12:48] all right
[12:49] see he knows that his foreknowledge lets
[12:54] him know that but do you realize then
[12:59] your thoughts should be on the basis
[13:02] that you know who am i believing has
[13:09] brought God to me you don't consider
[13:17] those things then could it be that he
[13:22] predestinate so you're believing he
[13:28] knows whether you're gonna come true or
[13:30] not right he knows whether you're gonna
[13:33] believe he knows how long you're gonna
[13:36] believe he knows when you gonna stop
[13:38] believing there start believing or how
[13:41] it will carry on see then we ought to be
[13:46] more thrilled about just the thought of
[13:49] believing the anything that we ask God
[13:56] for
[13:57] we must believe by faith right that he
[14:05] has given that unto us were to be
[14:09] healing with a big salvation whatever it
[14:12] be whatever you're asking for you got to
[14:16] believe that he has given it to you
[14:19] without any costs out any thoughts
[14:22] freely giving it all right and how
[14:27] important it is for one to believe you
[14:35] know I've been accused in my life of
[14:38] taking people's word people's told me
[14:41] said well you just take people's word
[14:43] about it well until I find out it's
[14:47] different why not right I mean what
[14:54] right have you got to doubt anybody's
[14:56] word if you don't know but see we say
[15:02] well I just don't believe that what
[15:12] about it salvation then see we're using
[15:19] that word in our salvation we're not
[15:21] fully over to redemptive part yet
[15:25] because that will come into the new
[15:28] birth and the times but we're still
[15:30] talking about salvation as being what
[15:32] deliver us you realize you're believing
[15:40] starts in motion something within you
[15:47] that brings salvation to you I thought
[15:52] we believed in Romans 10 that we believe
[15:58] in our heart and confess with our mouth
[16:02] what believe in our heart and confess
[16:05] with our mouth what we believe in their
[16:06] heart is that right I mean that's the
[16:10] way that really is see if your
[16:14] confession is not according to what's in
[16:15] your heart
[16:17] well good as you can fashion so you
[16:21] believe in your heart
[16:24] something allows you or let you come to
[16:27] a play a basis of believing and then you
[16:32] confess within he is the intercessor
[16:40] upon our confession right we'll see then
[16:47] it's based upon whether or not we can
[16:50] believe it and keep our confession going
[16:54] in the right direction
[17:00] [Music]
[17:01] but what about it what about your
[17:06] salvation being based upon your
[17:10] believing and the fact that God will
[17:19] come to that believing honor you're
[17:23] believing
[17:32] then we know for a certainty I'm taking
[17:36] it real slow do we get over to a spot
[17:37] coder want you to follow it the biggest
[17:41] portion of our faith is mental faith
[17:44] right
[17:45] I mean I'd sure like for it to be
[17:48] different but you know that's all for
[17:52] fun let's me me it's names I think it
[17:55] you
[17:55] but the biggest portion of our faith is
[17:58] mental faith but you know what there is
[18:03] no way for faith to start without it
[18:05] being mental you know what I'm a mental
[18:09] faith is what starts so it's not bad
[18:14] it's not bad to think about even at the
[18:18] biggest part of our faith is mental
[18:20] faith because if we take the mental
[18:25] faith and hold on to it God can bring it
[18:29] to pace to make it spiritual faith a
[18:32] revelation but it's based on our mental
[18:36] faith there's no such thing as God
[18:42] overriding your free moral agency or
[18:45] anything like making you do this or that
[18:47] or the other so then our believing has a
[18:51] lot to do with everything and you know
[18:54] that's where your salvation starts no
[19:01] brother Dale my salvation started with
[19:03] all right but now just remember you
[19:13] heard the word somewhere and there's no
[19:17] such thing as salvation without the word
[19:20] being brought unto you so then you're
[19:28] believing in God our God being real you
[19:34] know do you understand that if you can
[19:39] believe that God is real you know
[19:44] I'm not believing light and that's why
[19:46] we stay away from those things as much
[19:48] as we can see the kids say they don't
[19:52] know the difference in believing in and
[19:53] in God or believing in Santa Claus
[19:58] because they see a whole lot more
[20:00] evidences of Santa Claus than they see
[20:04] of God raaah see that's why it's so
[20:10] dangerous about the believing of the
[20:14] children that it puts them to a basis
[20:18] then it makes unbelievers out of them
[20:23] now just trying to get a thought on your
[20:27] mind see you've got to believe that God
[20:32] is real not a thought of your
[20:36] imagination not a myth are not some kind
[20:39] of a doctor release you or something
[20:42] that you know totem poles and and all
[20:47] like that you see why that it's so
[20:51] important that the church the church
[20:53] hear the truth now I was listening yes
[20:56] sir looking yesterday no it's this
[20:58] morning we're better ana was talking
[21:00] about faith and how that it's a fact of
[21:05] actually just believing God we think
[21:11] it's got to be something supernatural
[21:12] some kind of something or whatever it
[21:15] simply starts by your mental believing
[21:20] mental believing is where you start from
[21:23] it doesn't matter who you are what we
[21:26] are that's where it starts from but it's
[21:29] so important that our mental believing
[21:31] be lined up to what the court was
[21:35] veteran said false prophets brain false
[21:38] birth he said true prophets brain true
[21:42] verse right now
[21:53] we'll false doctrine bring a new birth
[22:00] and there was a time that his weight was
[22:04] bringing out the other thing about
[22:04] Martin Luther and the different things
[22:06] and all like that there was a time that
[22:09] you could lean on things but you know
[22:12] the Bible says that he winked at her
[22:14] ignorance all right now that was the
[22:17] time that he winked at it but what has
[22:19] rested that scripture and don't stop
[22:23] just saying that he winks at her Ignis
[22:26] he says that he goes on not just
[22:31] weakening their ignorance but now he
[22:33] commands everybody to repent is that
[22:36] Scripture well you see why the truth is
[22:41] so important now listen and you'll
[22:46] understand you see why brother Branham
[22:48] would say nine hundred different ways of
[22:51] believing a new birth because this one
[22:59] police's this witness and believes that
[23:00] wait this believes that would disbelieve
[23:01] is everyone and just changing her heart
[23:03] wording changes them to another thought
[23:12] you see why it's so important to hear
[23:15] the truth I've always said this and God
[23:18] knows this in my heart and always has
[23:20] been I preach for the bases at one time
[23:26] I don't have to preach to be saved don't
[23:30] have to do anything it doesn't gain me
[23:33] and if I hit you know to preach I think
[23:37] worried about that but I preach to were
[23:41] that people can hear the truth that's my
[23:46] goal that's my dollars because now if
[23:50] false prophets bring false burst then
[23:54] false words will bring false birds right
[23:57] and false Birds is not true birds
[24:04] come on think on these things now listen
[24:12] to what your prophet has to say let's go
[24:14] over number eight brothers and pick up
[24:16] the thought tonight and just try to get
[24:18] our thought to to give us something to
[24:20] understand we see by faith we believe
[24:23] God is real that he's drawing us to
[24:27] himself he's called us to come unto Him
[24:30] and accept him as your Savior right now
[24:37] listen to what he says now you're going
[24:41] to have to listen through tonight to a
[24:43] lot of the message code we're going to
[24:44] read some things that you probably
[24:46] thought the Prophet never said you know
[24:51] so I can't so there's progress road said
[24:52] no I don't believe that no now listen
[24:56] what he said questions and answers in
[24:58] 1957 he talking about Corinthians and
[25:02] all by one spirit all baptized into into
[25:05] the body of Christ he talks about
[25:08] Corinthians but at that time we receive
[25:14] the new birth and watch him this takes
[25:20] place is that we know what it's a
[25:25] question like these answer that's what
[25:28] they want to know yes
[25:32] by one spirit no no by one spirit we're
[25:36] all baptized into one body but now watch
[25:43] what he's saying see that isn't it the
[25:50] new birth that isn't when the new birth
[25:53] begins and what's you the new birth
[25:57] begins when you believe on the Lord
[26:01] Jesus now
[26:08] I know see they're laying here there at
[26:11] home so don't worry about it don't get
[26:12] all related I know what he says I know
[26:16] when he comes to the point of saying
[26:17] when you truly believe I've got him
[26:20] laying out so don't worry about it
[26:22] just stay with me or what I'm talking
[26:25] about the new birth begins when you
[26:31] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ the new
[26:34] birth begins he didn't say it was the
[26:38] new birds when you believe on the Lord
[26:39] Jesus cry he didn't say you were sealed
[26:42] in baptized into the body etc etc he's
[26:48] simply saying it begins the church we've
[26:56] got a lot to consider there's a group of
[26:59] people called foolish virgins that are
[27:01] believers and things but yet to fall
[27:04] short of the new birth and they wind up
[27:06] at the white throne judgment and how to
[27:08] be given eternal life based upon what
[27:10] they believe there's a field field Jew
[27:14] did brother Branham say they would be
[27:17] given eternal what on the basis and what
[27:20] is their confession the confession that
[27:23] they're Jews that's really what he's
[27:25] saying you read it he said they'll be
[27:30] given eternal life on the basis of what
[27:35] they believe then we know that it
[27:38] believed in Jesus should our Father see
[27:48] your new birth begins when you believe
[27:55] now you see why it's so dangerous then
[28:02] of the doctrines and the things that are
[28:06] among the people of this message and the
[28:12] seed they sow the long organized
[28:16] religion and those seeds the parts it
[28:20] was so
[28:22] you don't you sell this is this L make
[28:29] no difference well then why did your
[28:32] prophet say it if they don't like no
[28:35] difference what about it
[28:42] so then truly what you do is when you
[28:46] hear the word you know somebody telling
[28:51] you um
[28:52] you read it and a man picked up a track
[28:55] and you know and read it oh wherever you
[28:59] hear it from mama daddy or whatever you
[29:01] know it really starts with a mental
[29:05] believing I'll show you what run around
[29:13] if I get to it and says it don't seal
[29:15] you in the body because you're believing
[29:23] shouldn't want to there's a lot brother
[29:26] Brown don't say it because look at what
[29:28] he covered
[29:29] do you realize that'll give you a short
[29:32] quick run through do you realize what
[29:34] the man had to do when he came do you
[29:39] realize he had to preach the church back
[29:42] to the faith of the Father he realized
[29:46] in the statue of a perfect man
[29:47] he said he took him 30-something years
[29:49] to be able to do that no rage statue
[29:56] perfect man ready 30-some years to him
[30:00] to be able to preach the church back to
[30:04] the faith of the fathers
[30:13] no wonder he'd say 900 different ways of
[30:16] believing a new birth or a thought look
[30:21] at where he was looking at seeing
[30:25] mankind had got so far away from God
[30:29] there was a time right there to the book
[30:31] of Acts and it coming forth and for
[30:34] about four Turks ages you had it
[30:36] basically staying with the faith of the
[30:38] father not everybody had it but you had
[30:40] the ability because you had great men to
[30:43] teach God's Word but Iran said it was
[30:46] none greater I liked when he when he got
[30:49] to what is the third church age yeah
[30:51] Martin he said it was none greater than
[30:53] Martin he said outside of the Lord Jesus
[30:56] Christ
[31:00] he said the dead was raised sick with
[31:03] heal miracles and ever service almost
[31:06] have you read the church in his book and
[31:09] a relating of it columbic comes only
[31:16] nine it's holding on pretty good with in
[31:18] all at once you see it drop it barely
[31:22] comes out of a little two shoots of
[31:24] that's just shall live by faith but
[31:28] that's what God's Word it was enough to
[31:31] put them into the body of Christ right
[31:37] then what's that that message lie stood
[31:43] so many hundred years or something and
[31:46] John Wesley come along with
[31:47] sanctification just a little bit deeper
[31:49] there and in your Zeus's Street
[31:52] Pentecost came on which were
[31:54] Trinitarians Zeus's Street Pentecost was
[31:58] not oneness oneness started about twelve
[32:01] or thirteen fourteen you know Azusa
[32:06] Street 1906 was Trinitarians
[32:14] it's finally believers somewhere in the
[32:20] 13 right in there you know
[32:23] 1913 you got the one that's starting you
[32:25] think and then here comes the profit
[32:28] alone into the 30s and look what he had
[32:33] to do he said can you compare the church
[32:38] today with the church that started at
[32:42] Pentecost all right that's pretty close
[32:49] quote
[32:49] wouldn't it shouldn't have to be worried
[32:52] about it because you know it's true and
[32:59] it took him all those years to be able
[33:02] to preach so we're going to get into
[33:09] some things that's going to mean a whole
[33:11] lot of hope what about a man coming on
[33:17] the scene knowing what he knew he
[33:24] mentioned adoption the first time in 19
[33:27] and 50 I mean that song that's the
[33:33] records I can find talking of adoption
[33:40] in 1950 and they never did understand
[33:44] him
[33:51] we got a lot of lot of things to cover
[33:55] all right we see you must believe and
[34:02] then it's vital to what you believe and
[34:06] how you believe you remember that quote
[34:09] where we gave each other day telling
[34:10] about the Holy Ghost we run said you
[34:12] know spin from which incorrect me talk
[34:14] then he turned around they gave you one
[34:16] quote from what to hell to go see it
[34:18] he said you you you know you could how
[34:20] can you receive something's you don't
[34:21] know what it is that's in who is it
[34:24] smell I mean what Holy Ghost killings
[34:26] are you can't receive something's you
[34:30] don't know what it is I just got the
[34:32] hold it over
[34:33] that's why brother on Saturdays has been
[34:35] so mister incorrectly towels you know
[34:40] coat is just out is manna-fest
[34:43] manifestation signs and wonders and
[34:45] everything but do you truly believe as
[34:58] your salvation started can you remember
[35:02] when it started you can't relate to when
[35:09] you first accepted Jesus Christ as your
[35:11] Savior you don't remember when you first
[35:18] started believing
[35:29] come on vote most of us is old enough to
[35:33] know that one thing about it when I
[35:35] believe in started with Trinitarians oh
[35:42] now you argue with me about that angle
[35:45] arguing we here I'm just gonna tell you
[35:48] it's truth our believing started we're
[35:58] talking outside there well ago and
[35:59] brother dick was missing it where that
[36:01] people say you know they give me
[36:02] Catholic Church they give me a child a
[36:05] six years old when you have you know
[36:06] what that's what the believing stage the
[36:17] quote was implanted into the people yes
[36:19] but we told them to come to accept Jesus
[36:21] Christ as your Savior
[36:29] okay let's read a little bit go ahead to
[36:37] number nine just remember that now he
[36:43] said the new birth begins when you
[36:46] believe on the Lord Jesus the born-again
[36:54] experience they dude won't call it
[36:56] begins yeah but what if no no no I've
[37:02] got your number coach begins it
[37:04] no you ain't got me because when it's
[37:06] beginning is not eternal so you're not
[37:08] dealing with that way okay listen and
[37:16] watch what your prophet said in 1956 why
[37:19] are people so tossed about and there's
[37:21] an argument over whether that's the
[37:23] Intervale are the the different ones and
[37:25] there is actually two messages there
[37:28] that instead of just one but now listen
[37:33] see I believe that you believe unto
[37:38] everlasting life I believe that that
[37:48] your acceptance of the Lord Jesus gives
[37:52] you everlasting eternal life when you
[37:59] believe it
[38:08] then I believe by one spirit then you're
[38:13] baptized into the body of believers
[38:22] let's see that's what I said while ago
[38:24] you're gonna automatically jump so don't
[38:25] jump too far just stay with me so you're
[38:28] gonna automatically say Jesus gives you
[38:30] everlasting life when you believe ya
[38:31] that's when you really believe you got
[38:33] sealed in I know the quotes I got them
[38:35] but I better remember this is holding it
[38:37] down because if you don't want to
[38:38] remember that way you're gonna get
[38:39] eternal life and then you're gonna get
[38:41] the baptismal Oh God oh you better read
[38:51] and listen I'm asking you just simply
[38:54] pray and say God what's going on I'm not
[39:01] asking you to deny your faith that's
[39:06] what I've been hollering about so much
[39:08] you know so you try to say something you
[39:11] try to get me to drown my faith ain't
[39:14] tried to get nobody deny the faith I'm
[39:16] trying to see further or not you have
[39:18] the faith so either listen I believe
[39:26] that your acceptance of the Lord Jesus
[39:28] Christ gives you everlasting eternal
[39:32] life when you believe it then I believe
[39:39] by one spirit then you're baptized into
[39:41] the body believers you're gonna get to
[39:47] it in a few minutes all right so while
[39:48] you go down to Paul finding certain ones
[39:50] which was a Polish and remember Paul the
[39:55] Holy Ghost had fail but those in Paul
[40:00] under a Polish didn't have the Holy
[40:02] Ghost
[40:06] right so come on he find it
[40:13] upper coasting and he said have you
[40:16] received the Holy Ghost since you
[40:19] haven't believed see your faith anchors
[40:27] you in Christ
[40:29] that's intellectual
[40:40] you believe it you accept it you say
[40:44] that it's right you recognize it to be
[40:46] the truth and you're a Christian and
[40:50] you've got everlasting life by believing
[40:52] it and watch him you've entered to God
[41:01] your own the campgrounds manners fallen
[41:06] and you're eating now remember an
[41:10] account ground you've got to come in to
[41:15] the outer court enter court and the Holy
[41:17] of Holies the outer court is
[41:19] justification so now you're not mourning
[41:22] any justification on you you're just no
[41:31] I'm not confusing you I'm stirring up
[41:34] the confusion that's why it's so hard I
[41:38] know what it's doing
[41:40] I know what it's gonna cost because
[41:43] you're not gonna listen watch what he
[41:48] says go on number 10 little message
[41:53] called you must be born again he's
[41:56] talking about you couldn't pull it up no
[41:58] matter how much you tried you don't know
[42:00] my soul's got to be change here born
[42:02] again you say what about the Holy Ghost
[42:05] brother branham the Holy Ghost baptizes
[42:09] you into the body for service but you
[42:14] believe unto eternal life here at my
[42:23] words and beliefs on him that sent me
[42:25] as he turn alive what's really the
[42:27] scripture says everlasting then you're
[42:30] baptized by the Holy Spirit into the
[42:32] body for a manifestation of the gifts
[42:34] and so forth but you believe to eternal
[42:38] life now you believe unto eternal life
[42:52] - look how important your believing is
[42:54] and how important it is to keep that
[42:56] believing Judas believed in God Judas
[43:05] his name was written in heaven
[43:07] Judas had gifts but he lost his
[43:11] believing now here's where you're gonna
[43:16] run aground you're gonna try to figure
[43:18] it out right there you're gonna say did
[43:19] it did Judas have eternal life and lost
[43:21] it cuz it sound like brother I'm gonna
[43:23] stay in it you believe you could eternal
[43:25] know he didn't have eternal life
[43:27] you're not listening you're not
[43:29] listening to what I'm saying the thought
[43:32] was what the new birth begins when you
[43:41] believe eternal life begins wait a
[43:46] minute now then may I remind you that
[43:56] one thing is what God is looking at the
[43:59] other thing is what we're looking at
[44:01] right we're looking at it ourselves in
[44:07] one way and garden looking at it another
[44:09] way you remember the thought a minute
[44:11] ago God knows whether or not you're
[44:13] gonna continue to believe now we can go
[44:20] back to the statements and all Wade was
[44:23] talking about it Sunday and we talked
[44:25] about it a lot where people will say you
[44:26] know I always was eternal we know
[44:31] brother Owen said down you know brother
[44:35] Owen said we always was eternal he said
[44:37] if you have eternal life the eternal
[44:41] life you have always was eternal but you
[44:47] didn't have it as a possession right
[44:53] come on so you start to eternal live
[44:58] when you believe but you don't have it
[45:00] as a possession yet you don't have it in
[45:09] reality yet but you've got to start it
[45:14] somewhere and how could your prophet
[45:16] start in any other way then to do that
[45:19] you realize what I'm saying you just
[45:21] read some of the quotes that brother
[45:23] Randall says and he looks like he's the
[45:27] most nationally confused person there's
[45:32] ever been he said I can conclusively
[45:38] prove that you're born again and then
[45:43] baptized into the body
[45:57] why would you want to confuse this
[45:59] brother there I'm not trying to confuse
[46:06] you I'm trying to get you to simply
[46:10] think about what you're talking about
[46:14] could you just simply think about that
[46:19] today God crossed your path and called
[46:24] into your heart you started right there
[46:30] believing now we're going to read in a
[46:33] minute we're brother Ron says that you
[46:38] can do that and then you can lose it
[46:41] well now you'll never find him saying
[46:44] you can lose eternal life now if you can
[46:48] find that quote I want it in a hurry she
[46:50] won't find it you can't have eternal
[46:54] life and lose it but you could be in the
[46:56] process of coming to it just remember
[47:01] you got to go through justification and
[47:03] sanctification to come to the baptism of
[47:06] the Holy Ghost what about it okay we
[47:15] read one at number nine ten let's go to
[47:19] number eleven just think of these things
[47:24] cuz it offer the message you know why
[47:27] worse people are so talked about watch
[47:30] what he was explaining when he's in
[47:33] Christ
[47:33] Precure aren t of it in the three courts
[47:35] the justified man out here he walks by
[47:38] daylight and problems with that you're
[47:42] walking in the outer court sure you're
[47:46] eating manna
[47:49] now he's explaining justification right
[47:54] read it sure you're eating manna sure
[47:58] you are a believer sure you have eternal
[48:02] life sure if you die you go to heaven
[48:10] truly but what kind of a life are you
[48:13] living he's talking about the outer
[48:19] court that's justification sure you have
[48:30] eternal life sure if you die you go to
[48:34] heaven
[48:43] amen
[48:45] justification just believing in God does
[48:54] not give you eternal life but it puts
[48:57] the connection to eternal life if you'll
[49:01] go on okay
[49:05] listen what he says on the next one
[49:07] which is questions and answers and he's
[49:15] answering about the Holy Ghost and the
[49:17] things what therefore the question is
[49:20] that a man is saved and listen to him I
[49:25] believe if he's looking towards Calvary
[49:32] and dies in that state I believe he'll
[49:40] be saved I believe he'd go through if he
[49:47] had the opportunity before he explains
[49:51] the thief on the cross now what do we
[49:56] read
[50:04] you see when God looks down and sees you
[50:11] he sees whether or not we're going
[50:14] through or not he sees and knows whether
[50:18] we believe or not he can go ahead and
[50:22] write her name in the book of life right
[50:25] but yet when we come to the earth we got
[50:27] to go through the process so when you
[50:36] start believing if that believe in don't
[50:39] stop it's going to carry you through now
[50:46] when I'm reminds you of something the
[50:48] last two quotes is written in the order
[50:51] don't remind you of something he never
[50:54] said those people were bribed he didn't
[51:02] say that because he ain't talked to word
[51:05] about them getting the baptism the Holy
[51:06] Ghost he just don't believe in foolish
[51:14] virgins or believers but they don't have
[51:17] eternal life
[51:18] they'll have to be given eternal life at
[51:21] the white throne right we get there
[51:25] believers
[51:33] they evening will wind up giving their
[51:36] life for what they believe to
[51:46] must be something this prophet is trying
[51:48] to express to you and I that's why I
[51:55] said you don't have to preach sealed
[51:57] file miles plagues Daniel seventy weeks
[52:01] and not like that you know how to preach
[52:03] that this preach the simple new birth to
[52:08] me that is the most and I'm going to say
[52:12] it and I'm honest and sincere the new
[52:14] birth of only any experience the baptism
[52:16] in the Holy Ghost is the most
[52:18] misunderstood doctrine that there is
[52:33] well I really hope you just believe it
[52:35] and God gives you the Holy Ghost
[52:42] what if you believe in stops you realize
[52:47] before you receive eternal life you can
[52:50] be a believer and I'm quoting brother
[52:53] Branham and be a child of God and you
[52:57] can lose that Lord but just remember if
[53:12] you keep believing and that believing
[53:16] don't stop now are you following me I'm
[53:18] deliberately moving a whole message
[53:20] backward for you to understand this one
[53:22] point if you're believer and that
[53:26] believer don't that believe in don't
[53:28] stop it's gonna carry you through right
[53:36] if you don't get eternal life here you
[53:41] know you're gonna get eternal life dire
[53:45] oh that's what the foolish virgins do
[53:47] that's you feel sealed you and the thing
[53:50] that's what they do because they don't
[53:55] receive eternal life here they go to the
[53:59] white throne judgment as sheeps and
[54:01] goats
[54:06] how important is it to believe well I
[54:13] believe I like the hip down my unbelief
[54:20] I like that but now watch what do we get
[54:31] two
[54:32] we're on over where we done to livin
[54:35] live me twelve this hitting life now
[54:40] watch you read this the other day
[54:44] it depends upon depends on where your
[54:47] faith stands your salvation is good as
[54:53] long as your confession is good but when
[54:59] your confession drops then your
[55:05] salvation is gone for he is a high
[55:10] priest sitting at the right hand of God
[55:12] to make intercession upon your
[55:14] confession that's what happened your
[55:22] salvation isn't good as long as your
[55:24] confession is good now remember ain't
[55:32] said a word about the bad fuse when the
[55:33] Holy Ghost yet we ain't got dar we're
[55:36] still in the believin stage we're to
[55:41] believe in stage for everybody in the
[55:43] world are you gonna go over and telling
[55:45] people real why they don't believe they
[55:49] might be wind up and show you they
[55:50] believe more than you do
[55:58] we're bad is bad by that I'm saying well
[56:01] you just don't have a new birth
[56:02] my bad as the Pentecostals words on what
[56:04] you've spoken Tom no you ain't got it
[56:09] right
[56:12] you got the bad P as well go well no I
[56:15] don't really know where within you're
[56:17] still lost let me say something to you
[56:20] that I've said one more time one time
[56:22] and I'll say it does if you just listen
[56:26] to who's talking to you you'll find out
[56:28] a lot of meaning and a lot of times I
[56:30] think tell me about this what I'm
[56:32] talking about talking to you and your
[56:33] mister the night and you're praying and
[56:35] you're doing you realize if you're just
[56:39] justified if you just repented of your
[56:42] sins and that's God to forgive you do
[56:45] you believe that that puts your sins and
[56:47] to see if forgetfulness do you believe
[56:49] that
[56:49] all right you won't never have to answer
[56:52] them sins you might go to hell for a lot
[56:54] more but you ain't gonna answer with
[56:55] them back because they're forgiven right
[56:59] there's that right
[57:01] well you realized then you from the day
[57:05] you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior
[57:07] God ain't gonna tell you you're lost so
[57:11] if a voice comes to you and tells you
[57:13] you're lost you ought to know who's
[57:16] talking to you but I'll tell you another
[57:23] thought that goes with it you better
[57:25] listen to them voices because remember
[57:27] one thing I might not have what I need
[57:30] to have but I'm not lost
[57:33] remember the colored lady what he used
[57:37] to be ain't what I want to be or
[57:38] whatever but said one maybe what he used
[57:41] to be but run said she comes somewhere
[57:46] see her believing had brought her to a
[57:49] place what about it
[57:58] have you believed unto eternal life
[58:16] then according to what we've just read
[58:22] back over where we read from the number
[58:33] 12 from hidden life it's your salvation
[58:37] is as good as as long as your confession
[58:43] ain't talking about born again clearly
[58:45] people now talking about believer we're
[58:50] still unbelievers so you jump up and I
[58:53] got this and I got that how'd you get
[58:57] tired I thought if viable said to
[59:05] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[59:06] thou shalt be saved I didn't know it
[59:09] said we come here with eternal life we
[59:10] come here with is we come here with that
[59:12] we don't need nothing we already got it
[59:13] I thought it meant that we come into the
[59:17] world lost but that we started believing
[59:20] and our believing is our confession and
[59:25] God can make intercession upon that
[59:27] confession so listen if we read it
[59:34] alright let's go to what he's explaining
[59:36] let's see if he can explain this part go
[59:38] ahead number 13 I'd ask you to please if
[59:42] you'd listened to the message why are
[59:43] people so talked about or if you want to
[59:46] go to the inner veil there is two
[59:48] messages that they keep rolling it in
[59:51] the it's not here it's over here but
[59:54] you've bring it down there's two
[59:56] messages it's not just one there's an
[59:59] interval and there's a why are people so
[1:00:00] tossed about he watch down speaking this
[1:00:05] there is two different types of
[1:00:07] Christianity's seem strange but I would
[1:00:12] not say two different types I say two
[1:00:15] different phases would be a better word
[1:00:18] to use not two types two phases the same
[1:00:24] Christianity but two phases of it you
[1:00:29] ever notice brother Brandon
[1:00:32] you'll say something about a
[1:00:34] denominational attorney said they're
[1:00:36] Christians well now is he live or what's
[1:00:49] he saying he said they're Christians
[1:00:53] he's saying they're believers they may
[1:00:57] not be possessors but they're believers
[1:00:59] right so listen to him say two different
[1:01:04] phases the same Christianity two
[1:01:09] different phases of it now if you
[1:01:11] remember yourself in this and then come
[1:01:12] on down to the next one it helped to but
[1:01:14] just remember what he's saying one of
[1:01:16] them is an intellectual or a mental
[1:01:18] conception of what God has said in his
[1:01:21] word and of Jesus Christ by the way of
[1:01:26] knowledge and the other is an
[1:01:29] experimental experience that hard god
[1:01:32] has given the man in his heart he says
[1:01:37] the one intellectually is hungry he's
[1:01:40] feasting on God his fire feast doesn't
[1:01:44] hold out the other one seems to have
[1:01:48] victory all the time he's explained in
[1:01:54] two phases of Christianity one of them
[1:01:59] is a mental believer the other one is a
[1:02:01] true born-again Christian if you go back
[1:02:07] and if you'd listened I'll try to lay it
[1:02:10] out for you and try to help you in every
[1:02:12] way if you'd listened to a message in 56
[1:02:18] Intervale or either the message whatever
[1:02:21] you want draw the title if you'd
[1:02:23] listened to it listen very carefully
[1:02:26] what he's talking about
[1:02:30] go on then to about the lice of 61 and
[1:02:37] start picking up some like the the key
[1:02:42] going into 62 and start picking up 61
[1:02:46] you'll pick up you must be born again
[1:02:51] you read that message all the way
[1:02:53] through when God's people are so tossed
[1:02:57] about and if you don't listen and
[1:03:01] carefully phase what he's saying and
[1:03:03] talk about you're gonna wind up confused
[1:03:05] when you get into you must be born again
[1:03:08] that's when he said I can conclusively
[1:03:10] prove that you're born again and baptize
[1:03:13] the end of the body I conclude that he's
[1:03:23] right what do you mean you can eternal
[1:03:29] life you need to get baptized into the
[1:03:31] body
[1:03:33] no don't mean it I mean just what he
[1:03:38] says he said the baptism with the Holy
[1:03:42] Ghost don't make you no more a Christian
[1:03:45] then once you honor where do we read out
[1:03:51] that the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[1:03:55] don't make you no more Christian your
[1:04:01] prophet now you're just confusing well
[1:04:11] all right go ahead and number number 14
[1:04:22] diseases and afflictions he's talking
[1:04:27] about forever proves that you'll see the
[1:04:29] night after night someone said does the
[1:04:31] healings last they last as long this
[1:04:34] faith last but when faith fails then
[1:04:39] your healing will fail we agree with
[1:04:42] that you agree that you can be healed or
[1:04:45] something today and die that same thing
[1:04:47] tomorrow you need that quote but dude
[1:04:52] would you believe that going with it
[1:04:54] would you say now listen would you say
[1:05:00] ever person that came to the altar and
[1:05:04] got converted would be a Christian all
[1:05:08] their days he could be tonight a child
[1:05:17] of God and tomorrow be a child of the
[1:05:24] devil
[1:05:33] it's when he loses faith in God what
[1:05:37] sends him back nice purse strong in it
[1:05:44] very strong that he could be - not a
[1:05:49] child of God and tomorrow he's a child
[1:05:52] of the devil but it's based on his
[1:05:56] believing go ahead to 14 a conferences
[1:06:06] 1961 he's talking about yeah so the
[1:06:14] judge dismissed the case he's talking
[1:06:16] about in Florida I'm pretty soon you
[1:06:18] know I'm you know about Jack Cole and
[1:06:20] the things or the boy walk and and they
[1:06:22] asked anybody ever they told look as
[1:06:27] long as he was walking he was all right
[1:06:31] but when he began to doubt down he went
[1:06:36] and that's just how long divine healing
[1:06:41] lasts as long as you believe it and
[1:06:45] that's how long salvation lies just as
[1:06:51] long as you believe it
[1:07:00] but brother Dale you can we don't need
[1:07:02] to know we don't need to hear these
[1:07:03] things you tell me where to take out and
[1:07:11] move over and do about that
[1:07:15] I thought we're supposed to believe
[1:07:16] everything the Prophet says I didn't
[1:07:19] know it had okay
[1:07:22] go to next one ministry explained go to
[1:07:29] the next one 4:15
[1:07:30] how does divine healing it is does it
[1:07:34] last all the time in life just as long
[1:07:37] as faith life and salvation lights the
[1:07:40] same way just as long as faith life's
[1:07:45] when you feel that you're not saved
[1:07:49] anymore you're not safe first by faith
[1:07:54] are you saved through grace is it right
[1:07:57] when you come to the altar what do you
[1:07:59] do you confess your sins and that's God
[1:08:01] to forgive you and then in your heart
[1:08:04] now get it in your heart you have to
[1:08:07] believe that he is forgiving you is that
[1:08:09] right you have to be have to believe
[1:08:12] that then you walk away from the
[1:08:14] platform and then you have to confess it
[1:08:17] first that you're saved you can't just
[1:08:22] keep it under a bushel you'll lose it
[1:08:25] right now you've got to confess it until
[1:08:29] everyone that you're glad
[1:08:31] no matter there's nothing to what about
[1:08:41] I like this one and maybe they'll help
[1:08:44] you to understand go to 16 taking the
[1:08:51] five identification
[1:08:53] did you know you said well brother
[1:08:56] around them I believe will listen and
[1:08:59] I'll never receive the Holy Ghost no you
[1:09:06] don't believe yet now I'll read the rest
[1:09:11] that you are just believing on to belief
[1:09:17] that's a great state you have hope
[1:09:27] mental faith is where you start from
[1:09:32] you can lose mental faith because
[1:09:34] there's nothing more than hope
[1:09:37] but when mental faith according the
[1:09:39] Black Sea since name has been made a
[1:09:41] spiritual revelation you can't lose it
[1:09:45] so you can't have eternal life and lose
[1:09:50] it which you can have mental believing
[1:09:53] that would be called Christianity
[1:09:56] because the new birth by most everybody
[1:09:58] because eternal life because remember if
[1:10:03] it goes home it will come out to eternal
[1:10:06] life but may I quote wrote a random 147
[1:10:12] Church age book very few people believe
[1:10:15] all the way to receiving the Spirit of
[1:10:21] God
[1:10:27] so you're listening mental believing
[1:10:32] does not give you eternal life while
[1:10:38] your prophet would use it in that form
[1:10:40] it's between him and God other than one
[1:10:44] time if that mental faith don't stop and
[1:10:49] keep keep you keep on believing it will
[1:10:51] come out to eternal life one day or you
[1:10:54] go by the grave and come up to white
[1:10:56] drum because you're not finishing the
[1:11:01] eternal life till you believe in - what
[1:11:07] do you say you're believing on - belief
[1:11:15] now what am i trying to say the biggest
[1:11:19] portion of Christian world's religion
[1:11:24] salvation is mentally believing it
[1:11:34] mentally believe it and mentally
[1:11:36] believing they have it because they
[1:11:39] believe it and they have it they believe
[1:11:41] it's because of something happened they
[1:11:43] done this they done that they believe
[1:11:45] the message they do this whatever so
[1:11:51] what is the prophet saying
[1:12:00] I'm not through reading yet going to 16
[1:12:05] hey the message the inner veil and the
[1:12:11] reason I'm telling you there's two of
[1:12:12] those because one of them is listed in
[1:12:16] Jeffersonville the other one is listed
[1:12:19] in purchase Michigan there's two types
[1:12:23] that they're playing with trying to tell
[1:12:24] you this and not this one it's not that
[1:12:26] okay look don't know narrow minded you
[1:12:34] put a pencil between your eyes behind it
[1:12:35] that is nearsighted
[1:12:37] salvation is lice as long as faith lies
[1:12:41] and divine healing life is long
[1:12:44] it's faith life you just got to
[1:12:49] experience 40 years ago forget you ever
[1:12:52] had the experience and go out here
[1:12:55] tonight and say now listen I don't even
[1:13:02] believe in it and I'm not God's servant
[1:13:06] no more
[1:13:06] watch how long your experience lies you
[1:13:10] understand what he's saying go out and
[1:13:12] say you don't believe it
[1:13:15] what happened to the man in the church
[1:13:18] age book he was born again Christian
[1:13:21] when went out and got him some beer sat
[1:13:24] down he went off saying go and try it
[1:13:29] but listen
[1:13:32] divine healing lysed what's going down
[1:13:36] and read come on it the next I think
[1:13:41] that's the one yeah sixteen be going up
[1:13:46] alright you go the Queen of Sheba
[1:13:49] how many Chris how many as Christians
[1:13:52] per house ninety-five percent or maybe
[1:13:54] 100 percent raise up their hands there
[1:13:57] Christian as long as you believe that
[1:14:00] all right but the minute that you begin
[1:14:07] to think that you're not that's the time
[1:14:10] you start sinking right there
[1:14:14] that's the time your testimony is
[1:14:15] negative divine healing life's just as
[1:14:17] long as your faith life with it your
[1:14:19] salvation the same because everything of
[1:14:23] God is by faith brother Branham knew the
[1:14:30] biggest portion of the people that was
[1:14:32] listening to him were not Holy Ghost
[1:14:35] feel true born-again Christians don't
[1:14:40] you agree but yet he'll say they're
[1:14:45] Christians and they are did he say if
[1:14:49] they die like that with that confession
[1:14:51] as that way they're going to heaven yes
[1:14:58] what about it church
[1:15:05] that's how long divine healing life's as
[1:15:08] long as you believe it and that's how
[1:15:10] long salvation life's too so I'm done on
[1:15:12] the message just as long as you believe
[1:15:16] it don't worry about it I got some more
[1:15:22] on here
[1:15:30] let's go over to number 19 and try to
[1:15:34] conclude something then broader bring a
[1:15:36] thought together to where we can
[1:15:38] understand are y'all 19 but now as far
[1:15:42] as having eternal life this is question
[1:15:44] as an answer don't Hebrews and being a
[1:15:47] Christian
[1:15:47] you're our Christians the moment you
[1:15:50] believe now that's not make-believe I
[1:16:00] told you I had it in here okay that's
[1:16:06] truly believe on the Lord Jesus and
[1:16:08] accept him as your personal Savior
[1:16:10] you're born again right there and have
[1:16:12] eternal life God comes into you but be
[1:16:20] careful this statement is right but
[1:16:23] here's Paul with a house policy that
[1:16:27] were not born again believers doing
[1:16:33] brother branham's preaching you got to
[1:16:34] listen to what he's talking about he's
[1:16:37] talking to people that are sitting there
[1:16:38] that claiming their salvation is based
[1:16:41] upon something they believed shouted
[1:16:43] spoke in tongues cried right and he's
[1:16:47] trying his best to get them to listen to
[1:16:52] what he's saying
[1:16:55] the Yeti ain't gonna die Christianize
[1:16:58] them they said a moment ago if you've
[1:17:01] got one thing in God he'll never say
[1:17:03] that you don't have anything he'll
[1:17:07] always say you need more but he'll never
[1:17:10] deny what he's already given you now
[1:17:14] listen
[1:17:21] let's go down to the next questions and
[1:17:25] answers now before you receive the Holy
[1:17:31] Ghost listening now before you receive
[1:17:37] the Holy Ghost you are believing unto
[1:17:41] eternal life I told you we've come to
[1:17:46] the end of it and bring it back in the
[1:17:48] right order but you do not have eternal
[1:17:52] life until you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:17:56] because it is eternal life the Holy
[1:17:59] Ghost is God is God life in you then
[1:18:02] you've got eternal life do you
[1:18:03] understand now you see you're believing
[1:18:06] untrue til you get to hold the ghost
[1:18:09] you're believing untrue but you're
[1:18:11] believing untrue then what are you
[1:18:17] trying to say what's the prophet trying
[1:18:19] to say don't stop believing Church
[1:18:24] whatever you do don't get so down and
[1:18:27] out in mealy-mouthed his brother for Nia
[1:18:29] says Rousey wowser you don't get down
[1:18:31] into all of that and say well what have
[1:18:34] I got
[1:18:35] but I said at least tell the devil you
[1:18:38] got something when he comes and tell you
[1:18:40] you don't have nothing
[1:18:41] don't say well what are you trying to
[1:18:43] tell me about it farther if I don't have
[1:18:45] nothing because my nothing and your
[1:18:47] nothing would be together
[1:18:51] what about it because the next message
[1:18:57] we're going to take up to show you there
[1:19:00] more what the prophets talking about
[1:19:02] what we've got to get this settled
[1:19:03] tonight the next message we're gonna
[1:19:05] take up where brother Branham said and
[1:19:06] the Bible says it that no man can call
[1:19:08] Jesus a Christ except it be by the
[1:19:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost until it is
[1:19:16] the baptism when the Holy Ghost you're
[1:19:18] saying what somebody else says
[1:19:21] it is not personal to you so don't worry
[1:19:24] about it we're not gonna leave dangling
[1:19:26] we're gonna leave it on the line of what
[1:19:29] we can get because your name this is the
[1:19:35] last one go over to 21 he's talking
[1:19:40] about you just come back rejoicing all
[1:19:43] of them the names don't rejoice that the
[1:19:47] devil to subject you but rejoice because
[1:19:49] your names are written in the book of
[1:19:51] life now if you notice and take Daniel
[1:19:55] also because your name is on the book a
[1:19:58] lot because it is in heaven
[1:20:00] your name has been recognized Judas was
[1:20:06] there so just because your name is in
[1:20:10] heaven don't mean you have eternal life
[1:20:12] you don't have to have eternal life for
[1:20:16] your name to be listed in heaven are you
[1:20:19] reading oh come on you don't have to
[1:20:23] have eternal life you're denying to be
[1:20:24] least in that Judas his name was listed
[1:20:26] in heaven and he didn't have eternal
[1:20:30] life okay come on cause your name your
[1:20:36] name has to be wrecked has been
[1:20:39] recognized your names recognizing them
[1:20:42] that still doesn't mean that you are
[1:20:44] saved
[1:20:45] you're not converted until you receive
[1:20:48] the Holy Ghost now remember these are 59
[1:20:55] but this is 64 he said what are you
[1:21:03] talking about I'm talking about a
[1:21:04] prophet that stood back there and I'm
[1:21:06] gonna say it so listen a prophet stood
[1:21:10] back guard with a message as I was
[1:21:11] trying to explain a moment ago that he
[1:21:15] stood there with a message and he
[1:21:17] understood that there was an adoption to
[1:21:20] come he understood that there was
[1:21:28] manifested sons and daughters to come
[1:21:30] read Intervale
[1:21:33] he said I want to build people into that
[1:21:37] image Intervale 56 he knew what he was
[1:21:41] bringing but how could he explain it to
[1:21:45] the people he was talking about adoption
[1:21:50] all the way back you talking about where
[1:21:52] he said I can come pro proof from from
[1:21:57] let's see 19 and 54 is the first time he
[1:22:03] gives the scripture that no man can call
[1:22:06] Jesus Christ
[1:22:07] now remember because see it's wrong it's
[1:22:10] when it's in the computer no man can
[1:22:13] call Jesus the Christ Bible doesn't say
[1:22:14] that the Bible doesn't say no man can
[1:22:18] call Jesus the Christ it doesn't say
[1:22:20] that it says you can't do that it
[1:22:25] doesn't say you can't call it says you
[1:22:27] can't say no man can say that jesus is
[1:22:32] the cross it's not a difference in but
[1:22:34] my point is you can't find it if you go
[1:22:37] in the message quoting you can't find
[1:22:39] brother Branham using but three times
[1:22:42] then no man can say that jesus is the
[1:22:44] christ i'm talking about explaining that
[1:22:47] scripture the other times is 24 times
[1:22:50] that he uses that no man can call jesus
[1:22:54] the christ murder Branham was preaching
[1:23:00] adoption in 1960 yet II didn't
[1:23:06] understand I'm saying it that way you
[1:23:08] say I'm throwing I'll do whatever I'm
[1:23:10] just as honest as I can say it I don't
[1:23:13] believe he understood what he was saying
[1:23:19] you said the aad Goines say what you
[1:23:23] want to about me I'm saying it the way I
[1:23:25] think because remember Jesus grows in
[1:23:29] grace and knowledge so nothing you ain't
[1:23:30] gonna argue with me about it that run
[1:23:32] around come here knowing everything cuz
[1:23:34] I ain't gonna argue with you by don't
[1:23:35] tell you wrong I'm gonna tell you he
[1:23:38] said he didn't but he growed as he was
[1:23:42] trying to bring adoption he couldn't fit
[1:23:44] that together in the early 50s
[1:23:47] he comes into the light more into the 55
[1:23:50] and he don't get to hear him until about
[1:23:53] 56 and under here um you are born again
[1:24:06] when you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:09] Ghost eternal life and then you are
[1:24:13] baptized into the body for the gifts
[1:24:20] where do we get there
[1:24:23] that's the answer to the whole time
[1:24:25] that's what he's been teaching all the
[1:24:27] way through all the way to he through he
[1:24:29] was teaching that you can get eternal
[1:24:31] life by believing on Jesus Christ but
[1:24:33] then he's wanted to see a church they
[1:24:36] would have the baptism of the Holy go do
[1:24:38] you know what he said about ministers he
[1:24:40] said you can't even preach do you get
[1:24:41] the baptism in the old ago ain't talking
[1:24:48] about just accepting Jesus Christ he
[1:24:51] said well what are you trying to do look
[1:24:54] that still doesn't mean that you're
[1:24:56] saved you're not converted until you
[1:24:58] receive the old ago remember you're only
[1:25:01] potentially converted you remember that
[1:25:06] you asked me for an oak tree I'll give
[1:25:08] you an acre
[1:25:09] potentially when you believe on the Lord
[1:25:12] Jesus Christ as your personal Savior
[1:25:16] truly believe now not make-believe
[1:25:20] you've reached the stage that your sins
[1:25:23] are wiped away according to future all
[1:25:26] what you have is a potential remember
[1:25:32] potential is like asking for an oak tree
[1:25:36] I give you an acre I gave you what will
[1:25:41] bring the oak tree when you first
[1:25:44] started believing on Jesus Christ listen
[1:25:47] and you'll understand why your prophet
[1:25:49] stated it so much because you he's the
[1:25:52] one that said you believe into eternal
[1:25:55] life
[1:26:01] when you believe in to eternal life you
[1:26:04] get the earnest of your inheritance an
[1:26:09] earnest is the same as a potential when
[1:26:15] you receptive Jesus Christ as your
[1:26:17] Savior really meant it now not haphazard
[1:26:20] Li but really meant it
[1:26:23] God took your word he wrote your name in
[1:26:27] I know where brother Ron says it from
[1:26:30] home it's under sanctification is your
[1:26:32] name goes on the book at a believer at
[1:26:34] sanctification Judas's name went under
[1:26:37] in heaven at sanctification Judas was a
[1:26:40] believer but he proved it is believing
[1:26:43] wasn't correct I hope you're following
[1:26:48] me when you believe that a run said
[1:26:52] drive that stake down he said because
[1:26:56] you want to tell the devil right there
[1:26:59] the day you believed on Jesus Christ as
[1:27:03] your Savior
[1:27:03] as far as God is concerned you have
[1:27:07] eternal life I said it right Oh what I
[1:27:12] meant
[1:27:13] as far as God is concerned you have
[1:27:16] eternal life as far as we are concerned
[1:27:19] we don't possess it you know that
[1:27:23] brother Ron says potentially you have
[1:27:26] the resurrection inside of you he said
[1:27:32] Buddhists got to come out so you
[1:27:35] understand why the Prophet would say it
[1:27:37] he said you believe in to eternal life
[1:27:40] he said sure your Christian said sure
[1:27:43] you're going to heaven if you die like
[1:27:45] that but remember if you start here to
[1:27:49] make your journey and that journey ends
[1:27:52] before the rapture you were not a
[1:27:55] possessor of eternal life
[1:28:00] if you just believe it if you're just
[1:28:06] believing you're not a possessor you're
[1:28:11] a foolish virgin you look out here and
[1:28:14] listen church he'd listen and think
[1:28:16] about it
[1:28:16] I know it's hard trying to get across
[1:28:18] what do you think that I've been doing
[1:28:20] for weeks
[1:28:26] the people of this world there's good
[1:28:29] people out there there's people out
[1:28:32] there that make us ashamed of ourselves
[1:28:34] about a Christian life a great man
[1:28:39] passed away this day Billy Graham
[1:28:45] it was never nothing that I knew of or
[1:28:48] anybody that I know told me of any mark
[1:28:50] that was ever put against a man is
[1:28:53] anybody know of any don't know of any
[1:28:56] mark that has ever put against Billy
[1:28:57] Graham I'm not gonna tell you Billy
[1:29:02] Graham did now the only go kind of
[1:29:03] reverence he did but he was set aside
[1:29:10] for a job to be one of the two witnesses
[1:29:12] that would be one of the to witness it
[1:29:15] would not have anything to do with the
[1:29:17] Abraham and the Covenant of the seed a
[1:29:23] great land past home a milestone was
[1:29:27] reached as you could call it it's all
[1:29:29] right let's just remember he was a great
[1:29:33] believer do you understand what it means
[1:29:39] to be a believer and not have eternal
[1:29:42] life but to be a believer that is
[1:29:45] eternal life there's a vast difference
[1:29:52] you said well brother branham's one that
[1:29:55] said it
[1:29:57] if he said it there was some reason for
[1:30:00] him saying it are you gonna say he was
[1:30:02] wrong yeah well ago when I see it I
[1:30:06] don't believe he understood I never had
[1:30:08] no reference to saying the man was wrong
[1:30:11] you're a liar if you think so
[1:30:13] my only reference was one thing I
[1:30:17] believe brother branham groped in grace
[1:30:19] and knowledge and I believe this message
[1:30:22] when we conclude it you'll see the idiot
[1:30:24] come back in 50 he was trying to preach
[1:30:27] adoption by trying to preach adoption he
[1:30:33] would understand how you're born into
[1:30:34] the family but then on the stature of a
[1:30:40] perfect man he concluded it and shows
[1:30:47] you that you're born again at faith and
[1:30:54] one day there'll be a headstone strike
[1:30:56] this church it'll fill every fiber of
[1:30:58] our being and will baptize every one of
[1:31:01] us into the adoption all stages that
[1:31:05] have reached that place I said it right
[1:31:07] they never reached that place that's why
[1:31:10] the biggest portion is gonna go by the
[1:31:13] grave I said that 40 years ago
[1:31:18] I'm not derogatory to anybody because
[1:31:22] they probably got more faith in you and
[1:31:24] I yeah it might not be them waiting on
[1:31:28] us it might be us waiting on them you
[1:31:31] know Co we ain't there where they were I
[1:31:33] ain't never said nobody I said it the
[1:31:37] way the Lord spoke to me the biggest
[1:31:39] portion of people of this message will
[1:31:41] die and go by the grave before the
[1:31:43] rapture I still believe it and I teach
[1:31:49] it because of what he taught your
[1:31:55] eternal life that you receive will take
[1:32:02] you through but you've got to hold on to
[1:32:06] it you can't lose eternal life
[1:32:11] the tires were the problems that we
[1:32:14] could be at the place of confessing
[1:32:17] eternal life in our soul and not have it
[1:32:32] you could be a believer unto oh that's
[1:32:38] wonderful if we keep on believing but if
[1:32:42] it ends in age or whatever and I don't
[1:32:47] have that baptism with the Holy Ghost
[1:32:49] I want my believin to be at least right
[1:32:55] to where I believe you if I miss it I'll
[1:33:01] just be a foolish virgin or not no
[1:33:04] problem but I don't believe it
[1:33:09] there's got to be somebody gonna stand
[1:33:12] there and take a change and why not us
[1:33:15] confess we are then why not do you
[1:33:25] understand he said when you really
[1:33:30] believe he said not might believe so you
[1:33:33] know what a lot of our believing has
[1:33:36] been Mike believing whatever it's been
[1:33:42] Mike believing he's what I done to you
[1:33:44] you're you're going off on then no
[1:33:49] trying to get you to wake up and say
[1:33:55] lord help down my unbelief three years
[1:34:02] they walked with the Lord Jesus being a
[1:34:05] high they were pretty good believers you
[1:34:13] know what took him to the upper room are
[1:34:18] you listening
[1:34:19] they're believing come on they're
[1:34:26] believing took him to an upper room then
[1:34:32] God could come on the scene and fill him
[1:34:34] with the Holy Ghost
[1:34:35] they didn't have the Holy Ghost to
[1:34:38] delete him to the upper room and get off
[1:34:42] listen
[1:34:44] they didn't have it that way they were
[1:34:47] believers unto they potentially had what
[1:34:52] they needed now I thought about it the
[1:34:58] other day and I always put these in and
[1:35:00] I know that mark and Luke's not original
[1:35:03] come on so don't get under all that with
[1:35:05] me but you know that it's apples they
[1:35:10] proved they were true believers they
[1:35:16] proved you know why God what they
[1:35:21] started believing when he said Peter
[1:35:22] come on James John come on it kept them
[1:35:30] all the way through their life not as
[1:35:34] they born-again experience but as a
[1:35:37] believer that had settled in their heart
[1:35:41] more than mentally thinking it had
[1:35:44] become a reality
[1:35:47] they said working we go thou hast the
[1:35:52] words of eternal life let me at least
[1:35:56] say that let me at least say what can I
[1:36:03] do Lord I believe you don't stop
[1:36:10] believing come on musician don't stop
[1:36:17] believin Satan comes until you said
[1:36:23] you're not born again say hey whoa
[1:36:25] cowboy it'll prove one of these days
[1:36:29] whether I'm right or wrong and you won't
[1:36:32] have to face it I like what somebody
[1:36:35] said one time said when the devil tries
[1:36:37] to remind you of your pipes that remind
[1:36:39] to him of his future of what's gonna
[1:36:42] happen to me he's going to be
[1:36:47] annihilated he's a pretty good believer
[1:36:54] you just don't believe all the way
[1:36:56] that's why the Prophet said very few
[1:36:58] people will believe all the way now
[1:37:01] there's millions in the world today
[1:37:03] claimed to be Christians right there's
[1:37:08] right at a million in this message they
[1:37:11] claim to be Christians maybe more but at
[1:37:14] one time they did say they had a million
[1:37:15] in Africa are they believers are we
[1:37:24] believers what do we believe at least we
[1:37:30] could say I believe Lord you got the
[1:37:32] words I believe this message he's got
[1:37:36] the answer I've read and said studied a
[1:37:42] lot of things just like you just like
[1:37:46] the point of saying it but around said I
[1:37:49] can conclusively prove that you are born
[1:37:52] again and then baptized the end of the
[1:37:56] body what does he say
[1:38:07] he's saying very simple don't mind
[1:38:10] putting it out lets you think you're
[1:38:14] born again at faith baptize the end of
[1:38:18] the body of faith that you've got to be
[1:38:21] baptized into the manifestation of the
[1:38:26] gifts come on
[1:38:33] gifts without these virtues is what
[1:38:39] prophet said a stumbling block
[1:38:42] they call it stumble block in one of the
[1:38:45] things that you can't find stumbling
[1:38:47] they could put expel their stumble block
[1:38:54] the gifts without the virtuous now how
