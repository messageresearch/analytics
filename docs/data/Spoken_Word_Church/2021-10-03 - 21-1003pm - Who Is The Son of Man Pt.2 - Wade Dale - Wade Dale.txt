also you don't have to you not mandatory wear mask if you feel if you feel like you should then that's okay also the bethel camp will be the 28th through the 31st i think we've pretty much already june has got all the um t-shirts ordered um the order's in they're on the way for all the youth and then i i think we're getting pretty much together who's taking who and what's taking what see anna and richard about that and also remember for a future event on 11 14 that's 11 14 not this coming not 10 14. we'll be having our church thanksgiving dinner we're in service and a meal we'll get that all together as we get closer to the time and also we will not have church on wednesday before the day before thanksgiving it will be on tuesday so just keep that in your prayers let's go and to the bible there's john 1 this morning is we set up kind of set a little stage and talked more of the son of god but we want to continue on that because the son of man kind of shows itself in forms in the old testament and we'll talk about a little bit in melchizedek it will be in the captain of the host and the different uh ways he appears but that was not the son of man because the son of man is a virgin born god that comes to the earth for the purpose of redemption okay melchizedek didn't redeem abraham he brought him a message and he prefigured or showed that he would come in human flesh in the end time all right because the son of man came 2000 years ago but he's also promised to come now so this is the time of the son of man amen this is the time that the son of man is to be revealed according to the bible not in any other age ever in any other age he was the son of god he built his church on that as we were talking about this morning he built his church on the revelation of the son of god the baptism of the holy ghost and the souls of the believers all right so john 1 1 let's bow our heads remember all the ones that are sick the ones that are for the howl and the different ones lord brother uh dean let's remember those lord that are getting older and age doesn't mean anything to god i when we always my mind goes to that well they're just old well they're just oh well you know what brother bill dowell was 92 years old and brother brown he because he was healed of whatever it was he had and he's brother brown said i'll shake your hand again amen so at 92 years old god still delivers amen so let's bow our heads do you heavenly father lord this day has been set aside lord to worship you now father i pray that you would come among us in a special way may the worship be about you and for you lord not not just a mere mortal man but father you were god in human flesh and now you are showing yourself now as god in human flesh and abrid now pray lord that we would get a revelation of that that our eyes will be opened and that we will be enlightened to this revelation that you wanted to live with us in human flesh from the beginning of time and now you're able to do that through the redemptive plan lord that we've been talking about for months lord the right of redemption you came and became human flesh to buy us back father thank you for that lord thank you for the healing of the body thank you for the healing of our mind lord we pray that you just touch each one lord it's not here and the ones that are here in the building father we pray that you will just sanctify us for this journey that we're on give us a good day in you father in jesus name we pray amen john 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him so there's that logos the creator of the word that we were talking about this morning there he is right there he stood wherever he stood he was standing on faith it doesn't matter if there was nothing created he was standing somewhere because he's a man all right he wasn't just floating around like like a fog or a cloud no he was a man he was standing in one place his intelligence was saying let there be his intelligence his mind have the mind of christ is what the the bible tells us he was a creator he was standing and he was looking at his plan and he was creating by the spoken word of god amen and that's what i believe that he's standing in the end time trying to do the same thing amen in him was life no all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made so there's nothing new under the sun everything was made there in genesis the sea chapter of the bible in him was life and the life was the light of men so there's no other life besides jesus christ and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended comprehending it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john that's john the baptist the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light john wasn't but he was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him in the world knew him not remember the bible says in the day that the son of man is to be revealed that was not two thousand years ago no one knew who he was in his fullness no one even on the day of pentecost the baptism of the holy ghost came the son of god revelation which was the holy ghost the comforter came and went into the believers and they still didn't have a complete revelation because the headstone hadn't come yet the headstone had been taken away the headstone left when he ascended up but now he said he was going to come back the way he ascended right he's going to come back the way he ascended in a cloud that's why they hate that cloud so much because they don't want god to be back here the way they want him back here right they want to do away with that cloud thing they don't want having to do with that well the bible says he'll come back in the cloud because he took off in the cloud all right he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name because see you have to start you have to start son of god you can't start son of man you can't you have to be born again sons and daughters of god and then you grow into adoption you grow into the headstone which is the son of man which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nicodemus okay you must be born again nicodemus said oh got to go get back in the flesh or blood and all of my mama and get no nor of the will of man in other words there had to be a conception here on earth nicodemus was saying no jesus said no no no no the word was then made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you'll be seated and the lord has blessing for the reading of the word we'll just kind of go through a little bit this morning on the let's go to genesis 3 15 because before this before the fall god would walk in the cool of the day with adam and talked to him face to face and eve there with them and they had no problems there was no enmity there was no division god was happy to walk down there in the cool of the day and talk to his creation there was no there was no fear there was no condemnation that sounds familiar there's therefore now no kind see what we're heading back to it was what that was before we're heading back to that there is therefore now no condemnation well there was no condemnation when adam and eve before the fall walked in the garden of eden talked to god face to face and he brother brown said he'd say hey how y'all been doing today how's my children then what would he do he said he would lay them down on some on some pine needles or something and he would put him to sleep he said okay enjoy your rest i'll be back in the morning man that's bliss but that's what we're getting back to we'll be able to talk face to face with him and not have any fear amen all right so now genesis 3 15 though is where adam right before this says i was afraid because something had happened that he knew there was a problem he knew that he wasn't supposed to be that uh get caught in that situation but he did by eve telling him and him partaking of what she gave him so god is here saying okay i'm going to put enmity between thee and the woman see right here is the promise that he's going to bring it all back but also in this promise is is that i'm going to have to drive you out because here's the place that you're supposed to be at and you have fell from that and you can't get back to that by yourself see that was adam's problem adam was a shrunk of god adam had complete control of the earth but he wasn't the savior he had no saving quality that was not one of his attributes that's why he thought that he could take eve and cover her and then they could just go right back but see he couldn't save her he went out himself the prophet said he stepped they had to get out of the garden and man he had to go with eve because his attribute was not savior or healer or any of those attributes that was for god alone that was for jehovah or elohim or whoever you want to call whatever his name was then we know his name was jesus christ but he had attributes the different attributes there was father and he couldn't be and there is no way that adam you see uh there are several quotes where brother brown says uh there there's uh certain doctrines in the message that said adam adam's natural seed is what saved eve but i i can't see that that's what killed her adam's natural seed killed her if adam would have just said hey i don't want that anymore give me another one god and i'll start speaking the word and she'll start having these children spoken word but not but remember being that she was so much a part of him she couldn't do that he couldn't do that because she was him same way with jesus christ he couldn't not go to calvary he could not save us because we were part of him before the foundation world when he spoke and said that's why genesis 1 26 you just keep pulling the onion peel back when he's when he spoke that he had to die when he spoke that genesis 1 26 man and said that you know that's an eternal person but i'm going to have to die to get them back he proclaimed death on himself but he was happy but he was happy to do that he knew that listen to genesis 1 26 man didn't fall but humanity fell even with the genesis 1 26 man inside of you you're still in a fallen condition we've not been fully restored back that's why the son of man came because he was fully restored when he walked out of that grave he was fully restored the the end of his redemption was his body becoming glorified we talked about that in the plan of redemption or the eternal plan of redemption that's what that's all that's the part that he was that wasn't eternal he had to go through the process of death to receive eternal redemption and then turn around and give it to me and you so i'll put enmity between thee and the woman the serpent and the woman and between thy seed and her seed see separating and thou shalt bruise i mean you shall bruise his head and thou shalt bruise his heels saying telling us that i'm going to have to separate i'm going to have to drive you out of the garden of eden but i'm not going to forget you i am i already have the plan in place remember god didn't have to develop a plan he already had the plan in place because if he didn't have the plan in place number one he wasn't god because he didn't know all things and number two adam he'd had to kill adam as soon as they did what they did because adam was adam was the problem remember he wasn't deceived she was and the bible doesn't say and evil die it says and adam all die amen so what he did killed us in flesh but it didn't kill that genesis 1 26 man but as soon as god spoke that genesis 1 26 man and said let us make man our own image and when the fall happened he knew he's going to have to die to redeem that because listen god didn't doesn't god can't redem i can't say can't god's not going to redeem anything outside of genesis 1 26 man except at the white throne judgment you understand what i mean that's not children that genesis 1 26 man is not abraham it's not isaac jacob joseph john the baptist is not included in that genesis 1 26 man that is only god's children who have his own life by a redemptive act of the baptism of the holy ghost that takes your own nature and kills your own nature does away with your first birth and gives you a new birth that's why it's calling you amen what a plan but that genesis 1 26 man that's the only ones considering redemption even though it's connected to you you're still in a fallen condition but that soul inside of you is just as eternal as when he spoke in genesis 1 26 that's what we got to realize it's already inside of us it's not coming it's here the coming of the son of man the coming of the son of man is here it's god in human flesh aren't you sitting here today god in human flesh i believe it too brother but what are we doing about it if jesus had to grow in grace and knowledge so do we amen and we'll read that later on but not today all right because we're not going to get too far deuteronomy 18 verse 15 says the lord thy god shall raise up unto thee a prophet we're going to talk about moses in a minute the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet look at that capital p that's not going to be any profit that's not a major prophet or a minor prophet that is the prophet that's christ that's the prophet but now what look but then he connects it and he says the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee if he stopped right there he could have come a spirit because he would have been he could have been he could have been different than moses but remember god only works by his word he continued on instead of thy brethren boom brought it down here to earth like unto me boom definitely moses is a human being jochebed and whoever the two was definitely had moses so he was an immaculate conception right he was a human mortal man that was actually a murderer at one time amen so he brought it to this and then he's condescending of thy brethren like unto me unto him you shall hearken all right so that's the promise of what promise of the coming of the son of man the promise of god being in human flesh coming to the earth fulfilling the rite of redemption we'll get to that in just a little bit because boaz had to be a near kinsman he had to be human flesh he had to even be born of a woman and and listen he had to be born connected to the line of naomi naturally he had to be connected to that line or he couldn't do the act of redemption so god there's no way he could stay up in heaven and continue to be the father and continue to be spirit and be my redeemer he had to come down in my line he had come down in my line because that's where i fell i fell in my line this guy you fell in your line amen everybody okay with that that's where we fell from but unto him you shall hearken so there's the promise that god's going to have to come down like i said when he spoke to genesis 1 26 it just was a snowball it come into deuteronomy now you're going to have to god's going to have to come down here god's going to have to be ken folks to us god's going to have to be actually in my line a human being not a not a cow or a horse or anything like or even an angel no he had to be he had to become a human being ever went human being there was not a part of him that wasn't a human being except for saul he grew he ate okay same way with me and you that's why melchizedek could prefigure that we'll see it in a minute but melchizedek couldn't save you even though the savior was in melchizedek amen there's the paradox the savior was in melchizedek it he didn't change he still had that attribute but he was showing that he could appear in human flesh and speak to ada i mean to abraham and give him a promise and we'll see that in just a few minutes because remember there was two others that went to sodom why didn't god go why didn't abraham go they didn't go they stayed god didn't go to sodom i'll read it to you in a minute the bible said god went on his way he went my way hey man he came my way amen amen we'll read that in a minute matthew 16 verse 13 says when jesus came to the coast of caesarea philippi we talked about it this morning whom do ma men say i the son of man all right what do you think about this that's what he's saying what do you think about this what is what are people saying about me what are people saying about me well somebody says well you're john the baptist resurrected all right some say you're elijah because elijah's got to come compared to the messiah and jeremiah or one of the prophets he said but whom say ye that i am and simon peter said thou art to christ the son of the living god jesus answered and said in him blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church so he's going to build his church on the revelation of the son of god we talked about that this morning we've been talking about it and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so peter's got a key well he's going to use it here in a little while we don't get to it today we'll get to it later that's when the son of god came down into this dimension and went into the believers when peter said this is that this is that that key turned that keep turned we always talk about the key turning when he said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ which is fine but when peter stood up and said this i'm sorry this is that the key turn and whatever that was it had come to peter that's what me and you got to do with the word of god whatever the word of god says that's what's got to come to you because you hold the key you have the key inside of you you don't need a natural key to get in the kingdom of god i thought it was by the baptism of the holy ghost it'd be real easy to have a natural key if you could find one that's too easy no the key is in the bible the key is getting in the word of god but upon this rock i'll build my church and like i said before what did they build it on like i said you've got to take joel because remember that's what peter said this is that which said the prophet joel i will pour out my spirit my spirit upon all flesh anoint in other words at that time listen to me at that time peter said with the key if you'll believe on the lord jesus christ repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that key turned anybody in the world could receive the holy ghost before that they couldn't it was locked up but now anybody can get it so now even the people that just have an anointing can be anointed with the true baptism of the holy ghost but be raw inside everybody understand that how many times it took a prophet to tell us anointed ones at the end time that they're anointed by the true joel baptism joel 2 i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh old man will see dream or dream dreams young men you know see visions you'll see all that but when you lay it out just in a blanket everybody can receive the holy ghost now now god knows who will and who won't but we don't see remember they asked brother brown said well brother brown but predestination is the way you say it is why are you preaching god's just going to save them anyway they got this seated nope nevermind see anyway he said i preach god brings them in right i do i just keep preaching and god's one cause remember what is it paul says i i preach or somebody waters and somebody gets the increase god gets the increase amen so that's what you got to do you got to preach believing i preached today believing there's not one person in this building that doesn't have the holy ghost that's the way i have to preach now what's god got to do he's got to deal with you remember the preacher just gets the scale off of your eyes so that god can talk to you this holy ghost person can talk to you this i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh can talk to you and listen he will talk to every person in this world because see that's going to be the condemnation at the day of judgment he's going to say i told y'all i'm going to pour out my spirit upon everybody and you could have received it at any time and i came to you right here and you you rejected it it was for everybody but god only knew he knew only certain ones was going to get it but listen so now wait a minute he said oh now wait god couldn't be a righteous judge if he didn't let's go back to this judgment thing that just struck me just now if he said i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and then you go to the day of judgment and god says when i didn't do it for you i didn't pour out my spirit on you see then that person can just look at god and say well then you're a specter of respect to a person you can't judge me but since god said i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and somewhere the holy ghost is going to meet every person has ever was born in this world amen because that's the judgment it's going to be i gave it to you and you return you returned it to me or you turned it down okay everybody got that all right so that's the god that we serve that's the see now that's what god built his church on okay justification baby justification which cuts off your past sin doesn't does nothing for your soul at the moment right sanctification in your soul the unclean spirit goes out of a man now how can an unclean spirit be in there and a clean spirit being there at the same time let's go with the bible in luke i believe it is it says the unclean spirit goes out of a man it don't go out of your flesh it don't go out of your spirit that's memories and conscious effects of imagination it goes out of your soul so how can two be in there at the same time you're almost a two soul doctrine you got you got an evil spirit inside of your soul and you got god's spirit if you say you had this seed in you before you i mean when you were born no the unclean spirit goes out in dry places seek his rest findeth none comes back and finds your soul swept and garnished your soul swept and garnished cleaned out sanctification cleans you and sets you aside for service you're not born again at that time anyway see that's the problem you can receive an anointing of the holy ghost and think you got the new birth when your soul is what's going to happen this guy right here that made you do all them things that you used to do that made you do all them things that motivator comes back into that soul and he don't bring seven demons that are cursed worse and fornicate worse and whatever just whatever list you want to call it don't you don't drink seven times worse he brings a spirit so close to the real he be he brings his anointing which he was the anointed cherub he brings his anointing back into that soul and god can anoint you with the holy ghost and you think you got it and and satan's sitting in there going you're good yeah make sure you sit in the message church okay just make sure you come in sit in the message church you're fine you're okay but your soul brother brown said anointed one's end time your soul is still as black as such because you've let that unclean spirit come back in you and make you seven times worse than you were before that's why folks if you ever come to a place of sanctification absolutely do not rest until you know that the good man of the house has entered that in part of you and sealed it up not just went in and anointed but sealed it up put it inside there and steal that jar it can't get out then oh come what may that doesn't matter to me anymore all that doesn't matter all the little frivolous stuff doesn't matter anymore i'm sealed in this water cannot get out [Laughter] bad example stop that i screwed that on there tight they are you ain't kidding they're bad i thought that would seal that thing never mind anyway okay all right well let's can you erase what i about three minutes back let's start all over again but you're sealed if you had a true jar if you had a true jar i did this in um in jamaica when we had a youth camp and remember brother adam makes the analogy of god walking through the garden picking up the dirty jar all right and says i'm gonna use this well see i did this i did the whole thing i i put it in a bunch of dirt and i picked it up you know and i said okay this is you you got all this junk inside of you because there's no seal you've got all this dirt all this mud i mean i had it in mud and when i picked that thing up it was just dripping mud everywhere i said this is you as a sinner this is me and you as a center i said you got anything in the world can get inside all right so we took it to the next step where i got some really clean water and i did some dish washing i washed dishes i did some dishwashing i washed that thing out cleaned it out and i said oh man that looks good doesn't it but still the unclean spirit can get back in there all i got to do is drop that jar back into that mud and guess what it'll fill right back up with mud see that's the unclean spirit goes out of a man walks and drives places comes back fills the jar back up with the same mud that he filled it up with but he's more smart now he makes you religious he makes you feel that anointing that he felt remember he was anointed cherubim he got that anointing from god and then he perverted it i don't know why i'm doing this but it's for somebody okay all right but that anointing that satan had is so close to when he comes back in you think like i said before here we go oh man i don't goodness i don't smoke no more thank the lord i don't i don't chew i don't listen when i when i got born again i had already lost those desires now somebody could lose them when you get the holy ghost i'm not saying you can't listen you'd be justified sanctified baptism holy ghost within a day or a time but some of us it takes a little longer but i knew the unclean spirit was gone okay because i it had resided there for a long period of time amen all of us yes it was happy there we were happy it was there it was comfortable right oh yeah but when it left a wet tore out of me like you wouldn't believe but i knew it wasn't in your birth i knew because i quit smoking i mean i didn't smoke but i chewed like you wouldn't believe chewed the back and cursed that was my two worst things and i knew that it went away but i knew by the teaching of that man right there and by the teaching of the prophet's message i wasn't finished yet i had just the battle had just begun because them demons are going to want to get back because you know what i made them uncomfortable i made them uncomfortable i said no you need to go out you're not going to make me do that anymore but see that's debate for the devil though if you're not taught right that you say well how did you get born i'm like how did you get born again i quit no that's sanctification that's cleaned and set aside for service that's holding the jar up even god hold the jar up and said hey i'm going to drink out of that but not right now all right right now i got some work to do i may have to sanitize it a little bit more because there might be still a little bit of stuff inside there there might still be a little bit of you left because there was a little bit of me left but when god says okay i'm gonna get this clean water pure as ever because god's pure and then i'm gonna seal it tighten it down and i'm gonna use this thing now see that's when it can't get in or out you know what when you get sealed by the holy ghost god can't even get out we don't want him out but he can't get out you're sealed until the day of your redemption like brother brown said the box car you're sealed the goods have been sealed until the day of your redemption what goods the goods that god put in there not the devil amen i don't know what i hope somebody needed that okay because that's not in my notes but it is good because we need it we need we need to know and then when it listen even when it is sealed remember that that means now it's put in service yes not what i said you know boy i'm sealed god listen god does not want that jar to sit on a shelf he wants what is in that jar to project to the world what's in that jar which is god now we projected what the world had in there now we're going to project what god put in there we can't lose if we seal by the holy ghost you can't lose amen all right so there's the rock that he built his church on maybe that's the point i was going to make that's the rock the revelation that the holy ghost is going to burn you out clean you up seal you and put you in service all right so there's your there's what he built his church on everybody that's the bride of jesus christ from the day of pentecost until this very moment came the same way might have took a year might have took a week might have took a month it does not matter if you're born again you went through that same process and now you're going through that process again because you got to remember when we come to a full revelation boy i'm way ahead of myself now but you got to realize that jar never was in the mud [Music] i'm going to be like andrew glover you gotta realize that jar was never in the mud because the real you didn't do it but you had to go through the process because of redemption because you came from there to here but when you go from here to there it never did it in the first place that genesis 1 26 man was always to be put in use but what happened was there was a fall then god had to redeem by the three processes he had to redeem you back to where at least your soul is sitting in heavenly places at least your soul is like that jar where everything's clean but now remember too you got to be you got to be careful because i remember i took the jar in the analogy i was using with the kids i took the jar though and i socked it back down in that muddy water but when i pulled it out it was only dirty on the outside because we do have problems we have memory reason conscious effects and imagination we have all these things that we have to deal with because we're still dirt out here but there's no way if you seal that thing right when june pressure cooks those cans of beans and stuff if that thing seals right my how old how old green beans we got 2012. we got green beans that mama sealed in 2012. and you know what as long as that seal stays down and it doesn't pop up pop them babies open and eat them anytime you want to because they were sealed right the first time you get sealed right the first time you're going to be sealed until the day of your redemption ain't going to matter what date it is ain't going to be my ain't going to be mad or whatever it's going to be sealed since 2012. we got green beans that i'd eat today we might eat them anyway we might go to the house and eat them anyway but that's the way god is though once he seals you in you can't get he can't get out satan can't get in but if you still got problems because you're still going to be in the mud god's going to what i die daily paul says pick it up clean it off clean it off i make a mistake god just says okay i'll clean you off but inside of you is never dirty again never will be dirty again that's why that that that that jar will never have to go to judgment because what's inside of it's been changed what's inside of it is now god not the devil that's what's going to seal you to the day of your redemption and carry you all the way through to where one day you're not going in the mud anymore we're not putting people in the ground anymore no no no that thing is going to rise and never go down again amen that's redemption but upon this rock i'll build my church that's what he's built it like said on the day of pentecost until today the gates of hell are going to be against it but it will not prevail because once he seals you in like i said you he can't get out and satan can't get in all right so that's what he built his church on but now he's not finished though because that jar is made to be drunk from or used to put precious green beans in or whatever you know whatever you really like but god likes you enough to where he put himself in there and don't want to get out that's why when jesus in in tight when jesus come to the river jordan god said this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to be in your jar and that's the same thing you did at your new birth he said now i am pleased to dwell in your jar because i've sealed you by the baptism the holy ghost burn everything out because see even even when we're working with jars for the real canning process what do you do mom you boil them first you if there's any impurity inside that jar if you've left it sitting on the counter and a bug gets in it and or a spider or a piece of dust or a piece of lint gets in that jar see it messes it all up so you got to burn it with fire you got to boil it and once you boil it and get it all good and sanitized inside then you put whatever you want in there and it will not do anything but preserve what's in there now mom when you pressure cook it okay well same with us you put us in a pressure cooker tomorrow's what day what's tomorrow for those of us that have to go to work it's a pressure cooker it's already started but you know what god knew that though and he pressurizes for it because you know what those cans are made to be pressurized they're made for that they're not made to burst they're made to be pressurized and they're just thick enough to where they don't burst and god knows the same thing he knows what you can take letting off the pressure i don't know where in the world i'm going to go with this maybe if we get so far we'll quit then we'll start over again but let's look at number one but see that's but look one more time that's what he built all the church on all church paul irenaeus martin columba luther wesley pentecost the prophet of god every church age has been built on that revelation that's the son of god revelation that that son of god is going to come down burn you out put himself inside of you and put a steel on it and then you're going to act like him okay but now as we do that though as i said about going further we got to go further with that to make that jar him make the jar the same material as the creator amen because see we're all separate we're we're going to be used and put in service but what about when you become the one that puts you in you're going to become him that's the son of man because god wasn't the second person when he became jesus christ remember and then in standing we're going to get well ahead of here but when jesus was standing on earth as the son of man he said father i pray that they be one like me and you're one the glass became the same it's not two glasses it's not two jars it's become one jar all you see is jesus christ all right so look first it was god jehovah let's picture now a little drama we talked about it this morning where god's not this he's a light but he's not a light to where that's all he is like i said before if moses had a revelation an updated revelation when he met the burning bush and the burning bush talked to him he should have saw a man because that was a man inside of there talking to him it was not a botany life bush talking to to moses that was god that had something in front of him fire in front of him because moses couldn't see him at that time even he told moses he said you can only see the back part of me why old testament blood of bulls and goats blood of calves remember it didn't take away sin so moses couldn't see his face remember the bible says he said moses you can't see my face unless you die so he saw the back part what a pre-figure of brother brown said that was jesus christ not in human flesh yet right that's what he said that was the theophany amen that's why i said when when when god takes that genesis 1 26 man and he imparts or says let there be and then he says let us make man our own image make them in our likeness it wasn't a second person [Music] it was him made manifest in another form called a bride right not another jar our problem is we see two jars because we're human beings because we are in a fallen condition we're just earthbound and we're listening from heaven i thought he was here i thought he was down here well he's if he's down here he's not just in a he's not wood he's in human flesh again me and you that's what we're getting to with this son of man because listen truthfully if you sit down and analyze it when peter and the 120 in the upper room received the baptism of the holy ghost that was god in human flesh yes but it was called the son of god it was a revelation of the son of god because it only went so far everybody got what i'm saying because it was god in human flesh when god ever puts his soul inside of you that's god in human flesh amen but the revelation was that that was the holy ghost entered into peter james and john and they began to build a church listen me and you are not building a church right now we're at the end of this thing the church has already been built we're getting the man back here that started the church because we're not to the place to where upon this rock i'll be on my church no we are back to the place where the man standing there that said upon this rock i'll build my church that's where he is now see they didn't have that revelation the headstone or the head revelation remember was taken away what it went to heaven or it went over another dimension and this is for the church to build upon this rock i'll build my church so now there was a logos that went out of god in the beginning we don't need to cover that anymore i think we've covered that enough let's go to genesis 1 26 let's just read that anyway because i like reading it anyway and god said let us make man our own image in our image after our likeness so if he's inside of you today what are you supposed to act like okay think of that yourself and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and found the air the cattle earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created a man his own image and the image of god created to him male and female created he them so there's the imparting of god or the or the expanding of god but it didn't make him a second person it didn't make this part that's expanding a second person it didn't make it two jars we made it two jars satan sold us a bit of goods and we bought it so god created a man his own image and enemy god created him and the female created in them all right go to the next one genesis 3 15. so he's going to put enmity now that genesis 1 26 man cannot come the way he wanted it to come okay can't come the way he wanted it to come he wanted to come spoken word children he wanted them to be in the garden of eden that there not be any sin there'd not be any um sickness that they're not being but still remember brother brown said one time he said that would be discomplementary to god because he had these attributes in him that that being god they have to be displayed all right so he had to display these attributes of savior and healer so he had to he knew he the prophet said he knew when he put him in human flesh they were going to fall but he couldn't not put him in human flesh because that's what he said he was going to do he said he was going to put him in human flesh genesis 2 7. but then you see this and we see the fall and then this happened so he had to divide it out again and then remember he had to be jehovah god father remember it was god above us god with us god in us all right we got to keep that straight god above us because remember sure god was there with the people but he couldn't enter the people and use them as bride so i said even the great ones like abraham different ones they were under bulls and ghosts they god couldn't clean their soul up under the blood of bulls and goats but he covered them for a period of time until christ did come the great lamb came and died and eradicated all that all right nobody got that all right let's go to the next one all right genesis 3 22. and the lord god said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also the tree of life and eat and live forever in other words you couldn't stay in the garden he had to leave he had to get out of the presence of god in that condition all right therefore the lord god sent him forth because see they had sinned they had sinned and that sin couldn't stand in front of god so he had to make a barrier or the enmity he had to get them away from him knowing he was going to bring him back but he had to get away because he was a right he's still a righteous jaw god he's not a god that can look at that filth and say well that's okay don't worry about it no there had to be a consequence by the sweat of your brow you're going to die you're going to go back to dust eve you're going to start having babies and it's going to hurt it's going to be sorrowful you're going to have all these problems you're going to have your 28 days and you're going to have all you're going to this is the way you're going to live because you did what you did but i'll get you back don't worry i'll redeem you back therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from which he was taken so he drove out the man and he plays the east of the garden of eden cherubim's a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life to keep the way now what did jesus say when he came i am the way the truth and the tree of life i'm that person that y'all been trying to get to that you can't get to because of blood of bulls and goats because of sin i've i've now come to put this thing back together amen i'm the second adam i'm not going to fall i'm going to redeem this thing back because i said i was going to and i'm going to do it through a prophet like unto me mo the prophet like unto moses listen jesus was not was not a prophet he was the prophet man he was the prophet to come to the earth to put this thing together so now let's go to genesis 6 can't get anywhere genesis 6 5 and god saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth and ever we read it this morning and it repented the lord to him made man in his ear in earth and it grieved him at his heart and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and creeping things now look i forgot this morning now look and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created he didn't say he's going to save noah he didn't did he he said now i'm going to kill everybody but this one guy but noah but put your name right there because he's going to destroy the rest of this world and if you take that in revelations and all the different places he didn't say i'm going to destroy the world and save you he said i'm going to store the world i'm destroying this world with water i'm going to do away with them and i repent from even making them now that was not the genesis 1 26 man no that has nothing to do with that because we're part of this but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord noah found grace in the eyes of the lord so luke 17 verse 26 says it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all only eight people were saved out of seven billion people how about that seven billion people and then we said this morning genesis 7 verse 4 they don't have it up there so for seven days i will cause it to rain upon the earth forty for yet seven days so noah was in the ark for seven days so we had seven church we've had seven church ages to try to get this thing right we're the last so that's why it says as in the days of noah as it was in that day it's gonna be the same here we've come to an end and facing destruction facing all humanity dying amen so now let's skip over let's look at genesis 18. because this is the first appearing of god in human flesh in a man called melchizedek now i know i left the one out to save time that he met him at the slaughter of the kings and gave him communion okay but this is where he made a promise this is where he made a promise to abraham because he met him as abram same way as god's going to meet you in your journey but you listen do you understand more about god now than you did when he was born again this is yes don't even say no this is yes if you don't know him yet you can say no because you don't know him yet but even in your christian journey you know more about god so that's what happened in abram abram's journey he was walking in justification and sanctification and god met him and gave him communion and abraham abram gave him tithes but he really didn't understand who he was because remember they just kind of went off the scene there was nothing really ever said after that but after he becomes abraham after he's walked into his journey and he's 99 years old still holding on to that promise he was made 25 years ago god finally meets him face to face in human flesh now this i'll read you this quote in a minute but brother branham tells this story and who is this melchizedek and he says every son of the faith has got to meet this same situation at the final end so if you're a son and daughter of god today you got to meet this i'm just going to tell you what the prophet said and the lord appeared unto him and him who abram abraham in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him now they all have a place all right and when he saw them he ran to meet them he was still looking at three he ran to meet them from the tent door and bound himself toward the ground and said my lord now that meaning is adonai adonai go to the next say look says my lord if now i found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant let a little water i pray that he'd be fat see look he didn't have a problem he wasn't scared to meet god in human flesh because he called him my lord brother brown said he wouldn't have called him that if he didn't know who he was all right so he knew that was god in human flesh he did he said my lord so he didn't have a problem with giving him some water and washing his feet and rest yourself under the tree now let's go to the meaning of this word it's adonai which is close to adonai but look what it means amen when he said my lord he was telling that person i know you're god and i know you're in human flesh it wasn't a theophany it was a human flesh person that theophany was inside of that person but it's of men or lord the title spoken in place of yahweh and jewish display of reverence so abraham was getting a revelation that there was god in human flesh and he didn't have a problem with it he didn't run off and ask his anyway he didn't have to get a quote genesis 18 verse 20. now we know what happened we know that he told abraham he said okay according to the time of life you're going to have a child and you're going to have it through sarah and you're going to have it you know you're going to have it by this time next year you're going to have a baby in your hands all right so that continues on but then watch what happens here because we're going to read where this is also coming up in the day of the son of man so watch and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous i will go down now and see whether they have done all together according to the cry of it which is coming to me and if not i will know now what does he do he doesn't go down there he sends two prophets down there he sends two men down there all right and they were angels the prophet said they weren't human beings they had human flesh but they weren't human beings they were they were angels all right and the men turned their faces from then from thence what the two men and went towards sodom but abram stood yet before the lord so the lord stayed there with abraham all right because we're going to see a situation here in just a minute all right so let's continue on let me read this real quick because i want to interject this and who is this melchizedek brother brown said god in this stage now they don't have it here i'm going to read it to you it's this stage of his creation later formed in the flesh jesus from the great beginning that's where i've been taking you to spirit then came down to be the word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it just spoke out in morphy later he becomes flesh jesus now when abraham met him he was melchizedek all right he was melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end now what are you you're an attribute of god every son of abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing you're going to have to meet god in human flesh and he's going to have to give you a promise of a body change because that's what he gave a promise to abraham huh their body got changed somewhere after this time right here after god left communion with abraham their body got changed i don't know if it was the next day or the next month but i promise you he said within this year 12 months a baby takes nine months something had to happen pretty quick they were changed pretty quick after this situation so after we meet melchizedek same thing is going to happen so now look genesis 18 33 watch the order now look and the lord went his way as soon as he had left communion with abraham and abraham returned unto his place now something went to sodom watch genesis 19 1 which is the next chapter next verse and there came two angels to sodom and evening and lot sat in the gate of sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground same thing abraham did abraham bowed and said my lord lot said now behold now my lords two of them lukewarm church revelation of a trinity abraham didn't have a revelation of the trinity abraham had a revelation that there was only one god it didn't matter how many were standing around that one man that man is my lord i know that's god in human flesh these two over here don't know anything about them because remember those two were not to him those two were for sodom those two were for the world those two were not for the elect abraham was the elect god came to the elect there came two men and then he said behold now my lords turn in i pray you into your servant's house and tarry all night and wash your feet and what's the difference there he told them to wash their own feet abraham said let me wash your feet when he talked to my lord he said uh you know lot said go wash your own feet i don't have a revelation of who you are and you shall rise up early and go on your way now abraham didn't want that man to go on his way he wanted melchizedek to stay right down because he even said he said lord he said if you can find down to 10 people in sodom he said will you not destroy it he said nope i won't destroy it if i find 10 people but we know he didn't he didn't find but a few and they were they were lukewarm church believers they weren't true believers we'll read that in just a minute all right so behold my lords now what happened here is we're going to read luke 17 verse 28 but you're gonna see that what happened in sodom what was outside of the door of sodom a bunch of sinners perverts they wanted to take these two angels and get to know them and that no ain't just knowing and shaking hands that's what the bible says remember lot even gave his two daughters up so you can have my daughters don't touch these men don't do this so you got sinners you got lot the lukewarm church that didn't come completely out god had to get him out god had to tell him through them two witnesses or two people billy graham or roberts whatever you want to say because brother branham said he smote the blind remember he spoke the people's eyes through billy graham and oral robbers the nominal church or the lukewarm church and brother brown said i didn't bring the quote but he said there was three groups of people sinners on the outside lukewarm lot on the inside that didn't really want to leave he kind of liked sodom but you noticed abraham was afar off he wasn't even close amen and there was the elect abraham god stayed with the elect and the two witnesses went down to sodom now let's look luke 17 verse 28. likewise also it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it sounds like today but the same day that lot went out of sodom it ran fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all so right at the brink of destruction if you'll read that i didn't bring it but if you'll read that situation lot wanted to stay aaron's shaking his head he's ready before lot wanted to stay he said hold on a minute he said let me go talk to my two son-in-laws i didn't even realize his two daughters were married i thought they were virgins no they were married they had so they had two son-in-laws he went and talked to them and they didn't want to come out and the angel finally the bible says they grabbed them and said get out of the city lot kind of wanted to stay around a little bit we don't want to god comes to us to get us out of this thing i'm not going to say hang on a minute i don't have nothing extra to go get i want to leave this place i don't want to be tied to the world but see lot was that lukewarm church that was tied to the world his revelation was that he was okay right where he was at because remember now listen the bible says that it vex lots righteous soul brother murmur said he was saved he wasn't born again you don't stand by type but he was a saved lukewarm church member but he wasn't bribed the elect was up there on the hill that god had visited amen so we had that same visitation because it says even thus shall it be in the day now look when the son of man is revealed he was not revealed two 000 years ago he was not revealed to abraham as the son of man only in this day by the opening of the seven seals did we get a revelation of the son of man not in the years of preparation amen not in the years of preparation but right now when the seven seals is open we're getting ready to look at we're right at the door of destruction we got to make a choice to get in or get out quit hanging around i bet you there was a lot of claw marks on those doors that noah that ark when he pitched that thing on the outside with tar there was a bunch of fingernail marks because she there was always a bunch that hung around the door well i don't know about if if i don't know if noah's gonna nah come on it ain't gonna rain that that prophet y'all said he's not he's not real he's a deceiver he's a false prophet god proved to the world that noah was the prophet of the day shut the door because you know what noah being a graceful person probably wanted to do like jesus christ and wanted to save everybody out there in that world so god finally said no i'll do it so god took his mighty hand and he slammed that door shut and left everybody else because he said i give you 120 years because remember this same god that shut the door four thousand years later went visited them people again what do you mean brother wade the bible tells us he went to hell and preached to the souls that were in prison in the days of noah he told those seven billion people i'm what noah was trying to get you to talk they talked to you about 4 000 years ago he said but i can't do anything for you now he said i'm just down here for a witness i'm telling you i'm the one that he preached about don't ever let him tell you that don't ever let him go to another dimension and tell you i'm the one that that brother or that prophet preached about it's going to happen there's going to come a time they're going to meet that person they turn down but even though shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed let's let's look at one more situation and then we'll close right here everybody all right let's look at moses now look moses is the one that said god will raise up a prophet like unto me amen he's the one who said that so there will be a prophet in human flesh come to a generation of people and call them out yes what did moses do moses was sent to a generation of people to call them out right call them out of egypt so jesus christ is the same thing he's going to raise a prophet like unto me that prophet is going to come and do the same thing and you'll hearken to his voice or you should but now look that was jehovah and i'm trying to cut some of this out to save time that was jehovah in a tabernacle they built a tabernacle that was an outer court justification inner court right sanctification there was just a little bit of artificial light the prophet said a little bit of shoe bread right but then the holy of holies see that many people could go many people will get justified many people because there's a lot of area out here but you go into that next room and the room gets smaller you can only fit so many people only the priest and the high priest could go into that room right but when you go into the third room one person one person meets one person that's where god resides and the priest high priest once a year went behind that veil and gave blood for the people the blood of the of the lamb for the people and look they didn't see god the whole time sure they saw his manifestation fire smoke lights whole built i mean the whole mountain was on fire they heard the thunder they heard the rumbling but they only listened to moses and they didn't listen to moses of very much anyway because listen what did moses have to do once or twice i know he did one time he throwed himself in front of the door of god and said look if you're going to kill them you got to kill me because god said get out of the way i'm going to wipe this bunch off and i'm going to start all over again but moses through himself the prophet said in the breach and became as christ became as christ he wasn't christ he came as christ and said look you're gonna have to come over me to get to them wow you know that's what jesus said jesus told the heavenly father he said you're gonna have to come over me to get to them you can't get by me i'm going to die i'm going to give my life so that i can save them people that's what moses said moses said god if you're going to kill them you've got to kill me have we ever thrown ourself in the breach through that have you ever got that desperate for your kids and said god you're going to take me take me lord save my kids but listen this is what god said about these people that followed the cloud and they followed the fire and they followed listen we were talking the other day you know the bible even tells us that god was so much around these people to when they were born they wore diapers and they wore onesies most of you know what onesies are right but that same person 40 years later who's wearing the same clothes not a onesie and what the bible say the bible said their their clothes never got worn they didn't have to change or make clothes it grew with the person they're shoes i think i did me and michael were talking about i mean michael's got like a size 15. and so is andrew glover they both wore the same size shoe i mean it was four cows worth of shoes out there four full cows but think about it though their shoes grew their clothes grew god said here's you some clay i mean here's you some manna hears you some quail i i'm gonna just like make a stream that runs beside you and all you gotta do is reach down and get you some water and and and you and i'm gonna i'm gonna water two million people plus animals every day for 40 years and they did not like him they died in the wilderness dead jesus said they're everyone eternally separated from god but this is what he said about them i want you to put yourself in this place for thou art a holy people now this is deuteronomy this is what god is saying as they get ready to enter their journey for thou art a holy people unto the lord thy god the lord thy god has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are on the face of this earth the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were special or you were more in numbers that's what it says here because you were more in numbers than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bond men from the hands of pharaoh king of egypt put yourself in that place this is what he's done for you he's took you out delivered you out of what your bondman whatever bounds you you know that's what a bondman is somebody that bound that binds you all right know therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god which keepeth commandment and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to 1 000 generations wow that's what he said about a group of people that didn't even do what he said that group of people gave him trouble because they didn't have the baptism of the holy ghost but you by the baptism of the holy ghost that's to you and you can do that amen you and i can do that listen the rite of redemption has been claimed and that's what we'll talk about next time we'll come to boaz at the rite of redemption let's stand to our feet boaz had to be in the same line as naomi or he could not redeem naomi's property so jesus christ had to become the son of man to redeem or to play the part of the rite of redemption what did boaz do he took his feet took his shoe off and he held it up and he said today i redeem jesus christ put both hands out he said today i redeem all my property satan death where'd you stand grave where's your victory we have all things take that promise i thought that was a real neat promise there you i'd put that thing and read it again deuteronomy there in seven verse six for thou art a holy people the lord thy god has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth listen that genesis 1 26 man he did everything even died for that group of people and that's me and you by the baptism of the holy ghost not by our natural birth but by new birth that's what god did for us he was going to have i read it in blasphemies names brother brown said god's going to have a bride and he said i hope i'm part of it. he said but i'll say again god is going to have a bride so listen god is going to have a group of people that will manifest the son of man in the end time he promised it as it was in the days of noah as it was in the days of lot so shall it be when the son of man is being revealed now just show up jesus christ didn't just show up he came with a plan and a purpose from his birth to his death there was a purpose for that man to be here and now where is that man in you by the new birth flesh becoming word word becoming flesh let's bow our heads just for a minute if anybody has a need we're getting ready to take communion i know we're going to get into that but if you have a need and feel lift your hand up i know we all do dear heavenly father lord we pray that what we've said lord has been pleasing to you and lord that it becomes a reality not just mere words lord but it become a reality in our hearts and lives father we ask you to forgive us of our sins as we're getting ready to partake of this communion lord we're going to read the promises that we get but we're also going to read the condemnation if we don't get rid of the things that we need to get rid of father we pray lord it should sanctify us for this journey lord take care of us lead us in guide us by the holy spirit be with us from the front to the back sanctify lord the ones that are even not here lord that are listening in and they're sick at home and couldn't get here today we pray lord that you raise them up for your honor the glory and bring them here father we pray that you just bless the bride around the world be with the ones that are sick lord be with the ones lord that are sin sick more than anything lord save their souls father all of our children we have somebody right now that we can call their name and our mind that we know needs you lord and i pray that you'll minister to that person and lord come to him in the sweetness of the night and say i want to be your savior i died at calvary to redeem you now please just accept me father we pray that you'll be with our pastor keep him safe again lord continue lord i see the work being done and father we pray that you will just be with uh excuse me be with the ones lord there lord we pray many times for the ones that are trying to leave this message and the ones that are already left we still pray for them lord we still pray for them we don't count them out because lord you can bring them back but lord please catch them lord because it's getting close father lord give us our daily bread as we read the scripture lord grant lord i request lord of healing and of salvation for the people lord in jesus name we pray amen let's go ahead in the communion first corinthians 11 verse 23 and we're just going to take communion and then we'll do foot washing in november all right you love the lord what a mighty god we serve all right first corinthians 11 verse 23 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you now this is paul he received the revelation paul wasn't in the upper room to receive communion amen he wasn't there but the lord gave him a revelation and must have gave him a vision brother bob because he wrote it just like it was said he gave it to paul because paul had a deeper revelation of what was going on amen for i have received of the lord that which i also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread see that was a night before he was betrayed and then the next day was was the feast and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you that's due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup which he had saying this cup is the new testament in my blood see the old testament was the blood of bulls and ghosts the old testament was covering or capoed their sin the old they had to depend on one man to go behind the holy of holies this man right here is fishing to do away with all that he's fixing to say now you can come to me all you that labor in heavy laden and i'll give you rest after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sure of the lord's death till i come that's why i like for us taking communion every month because it reminds us it reminds us of what god did for us amen wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup so it gives you a way out it gives you it gives you a way to repent for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily either to drink of damnation unto himself not discerning the lord's body now who's the lord's body it's not that right there it's this right here it's this body not not the symbols not his natural body but his spiritual body on earth called the bride amen for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened to the lord that we should not be condemned with the world remember we've been called out we've been a special people wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any many man hunger let him eat at home you know the situation with that paul come up to the corinthians and they were just having like a feast and getting drunk and eating all kind of stuff and just they were just having a thanksgiving dinner he said no he said it's way more solemn than that folks this is a solemn time it's not something you know this is okay but i wouldn't want to have this as a meal right but jesus christ suffered so we're to show that that he suffered a blood and flesh and give it for me and you wherefore my brother when you come together to eat terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home not here letting me at home that you come not together in the condemnation and the rest will i set an order when i come in other words he was coming back to see the corinthians and he was going to set all this in order so let's tarry for just a few moments the prophet of god said pray for your pastor and he'll be praying for you jesus name we pray amen the bible said he took bread and blessed it dear heavenly father lord this bread has been made lord with holy hands it's not been bought it's not been took out of a box lord but it's been made with sanctified hands lord and it's been made the way you wanted it made so lord i pray that as we take this communion today that this bread and this wine will absolutely lord help us lord become closer to you father and lord to do the things that we're supposed to do lord and not let the devil have any place from this day forward in jesus name we pray amen yeah as i've told you before we when we were younger we uh i guess terence was a baby back then but we'd sit on the counter there and up on top of the hill and had a little bitty counter a small kitchen and we'd sit there and we'd watch them get all this grape juice ready and watch them get all this stuff out of a box and it was a little absolute i a perfect square wafer and they would all have to thaw it out because it was held over because we didn't have that revelation that it's not to be held over that it wasn't they didn't take it you know seriously not sacred not have wine i guess they figured that wine was too strong for them i guess they thought the holy ghost was too strong for them you know but we know the truth we know the truth we know the truth has set us free it's give us lord it's give us liberty and we've seen people healed taking this communion we have seen people literally healed uh i believe dad somebody spoke in tongues one time when they were you took communion to somebody that was uh brother dean i think it was was speaking in tongues when he started taking the communion so listen this is not just a ritual folks god told us to do this till he comes and if he didn't then he's a liar and he's not a liar he said his word will not return void so when we take this thing if you've got something in your heart that you need physically spiritually whatever you want take this is the same thing as it being not the body and blood of the lord but a symbol what is communion intimacy it's becoming closer to god listen the first communion was ever given was given by the man himself right to a group of people he said this is my body which is going to be broken for you this do ye in remembrance of me to heavenly father lord this wine has been made by holy hands father and it's true wine that gets better with age it doesn't it doesn't get worse and it doesn't ferment lord it becomes lord wonderful clear wine lord that even actually helps us even in our healthy part of our body lord so i pray lord as we partake of this lord it will remember that the blood flowed at calvary it flowed out of your body lord and it hit the ground and lord you sanctified us lord and you give us a journey to go on the lord and now we are coming forward to the end of that journey and i pray lord that we receive more revelation as the days come lord we pray this in jesus name amen come morning i'll walk by the river i'll rest near the evergreen tree [Music]
