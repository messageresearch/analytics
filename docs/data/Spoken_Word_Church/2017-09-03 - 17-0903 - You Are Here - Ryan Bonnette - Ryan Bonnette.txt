[Music] everybody [Music] [Applause] home [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] and then that our turn back from the Lord and those that have not sought the Lord nor inquired for him to come to pass and that they say it's Lord that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate and howling from the second and oppression from the hills the great day of the Lord is near it is near and hast expressly even the horse of the day of the Lord the mighty man shall primarily land before the decree drink forth before the day passed as the chaste before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you before the day of the Lord's anger come upon you righteousness there for the family of cents Lord of hosts the God of Israel surely Moab shall be a sovereign and the children of Amon as tomorrow even the breeding of metals and salt pits and a perpetual desolation the residue my people shall spoil them and the remnant among people shall possess everyone minutes late yeah although I also may be then this is the rejoicing city that dwell carelessly the set of the set of our heart I am and there is no massage cane how is she become a desolation a place for beasts a lie down them every one that passeth five her shell kiss and wipers she obeyed not the voice she received not correction she trusted not in the Lord she drew not therefore ye upon me saith the Lord until the day that I rise up to the pray for my determination is to gather the nation's that I may assemble the kingdoms to pour upon them on indignation even all my fierce anger for all the Earth's shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy Lord to serve him within one consent I will also leave in the midst of man afflicted and poor people and they shall trust afraid the Lord has taken away by judgments have cast out the enemy the king of Israel even the Lord is in the midst of thee thou shalt not see people anymore the LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty he will say rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will joy over thee with singing [Music] people today what I'm talking about is you are here by the way make an illustration about this when you go station down sender wakes something about the mall directory when you're in a mall you want to get somewhere you go to the directory and it says you are here you have to know either read to know how to get where you're going that's you know where to start from you don't have a little star or the doer is really small at home I'm going to put a map on that with an appropriate but you know you know about anyway so I want to reiterate something from my last lesson - I think I'm out of stepped on toes and her feelings when I said something about us thinking we're too dumb I included man that I'm not calling you all dumb I'm just saying a lot of times we make excuses and say that I think I'm too dumb understand be on truck you know my read what I do I dig into the word go does I'm not gonna understand in any way okay well come on fingers I'm just saying that's been a struggle I've had all right he just stop stop that's not mine you just don't stop studying and praying Singhania and now everybody know what steel toe shoes are okay I'm gonna step on toes and I want to take a photo sorry if I hurt your feeling for some things I want to say yeah way that's way it's a more the Lord like this one I'm hard I believe so we're on a wool apologetically all right and I may be increasing to the park that's really I think all the cream of the crop I see you people come to the stomach school when you can you come to vows take lessons you can't come to church message again and but still just consider these things and see if they apply to you okay I would love to see what y'all do y'all seek the Lord and serve the Lord and you strive and that's what I vote okay so I'm not condescending this is to me too yes so the Lord laid that's not my heart here a couple weeks ago they don't mind a lot pertains to my co-workers I've worked with them for well over a decade and never really told most of them what I believe and I had more surrender market recently start way to send the people and handing out tracts and just trying to do one thing is just to get people to seek God because everybody from the bottom rung all the way up and Christianity the people who just are Christians by name only lightning and they got saved when they were a kid and then that was their ticket to heaven so little big then they thought they can go out and do whatever they want live their life cussing drinking and smoking right thank you net for the rapture comes they'll just be sucked out of here and if they die that it's go to heaven well that's not true repentance okay so I see people that work doing that I see a lot of them that are real Christians nominal Christians that have plateaued because they're walking over life let's see in both cases and even on over into the message my point is just try to get people to never stop sitting garbage that's all okay we are in a segment see right over it heard the sermon Satan's evening event said that Satan dominates and where he said his establishment is in religious sense it's not just custom drinking smoking he comes all the way over here to the True Vine and it's very close to the truth-- island and causes you to just be one word off okay that's his deception he dominates and that religious realm he doesn't care that much about the people in the bars he's over here with us in church he trying to cause us to lose focus and eat the sea okay so the objective to take is to see the importance of awakening from spiritual sleep and seeing your position in Christ and by seeking camp okay Romans 13:11 and that knowing the time that now is it is not time to a high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believe where you can say first believe in other words when you begin your journey okay you're a lot closer to now than what you were then to our salvation in our case to a body changing director and it's time to awake out of sleep secretin is 11 3 but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ that verse really stands out to me about last time I thought because Satan bills interception and subtlety right but God is not deceptive and just hides and simplicity all right he has a purpose for doing that but he's not a deceiver he's not he does blind like the Jews you know if you say for a purpose for the Gentiles to command for you but he blinds something was awesome or purpose okay but the Tree of Life the fare box is still here waiting on us to seek Him it's not hidden he's not far off you know about this he's not even and I'm heart in the mouth they have a message the Word of God right here waiting on you to be enter okay but he's not entirely simplicity but until you come and and make yourself available to him he'll be hidden to you okay it's asinine now as we protocol read all that ends up tonight a few minutes ago I can't find where on the ground ever preached out of the book of Zephaniah and I'm not good at looking up close you know I only do it pretty much when I'm teaching Sunday school that I just read the message where they go but all the found where he said is F&I is that one timer he said I can find Zechariah tonight as long as I'm trying even mentioned it I don't know why he didn't teach on it or preach on it much but it's there and it has to be revealed it has to be fulfilled so I'm going to use it today and I'm not saying that I have the revelation of everything in the lower Zephaniah I'm only using that as a sort of a blueprint and saying this in the same God the children Israel that he is to us okay so he works in the same way that's all I'm doing being exalted and saying I got the revelation of this I just simply saw something the Lord in with me and if you have your vows trying to uh if you have scope of the Bible now it's only stuff above I'm already snowfields notes on page 9 59 that's 959 is on the first chapters of Inaba right there the top Scofield says dis prophet a contemporary of jeremiah exercised his ministry during the reign of Josiah it was a time of revival so it sounds like the time were and now I'm jumping and shouting but the time of the word being or by the restoration work right the urgency and balance being restored so we're in a time of spiritual revival with the world being school but the captivity was impending nevertheless the rapture wealth mistake on the other side of the tribulation was pending right when sefirot once out the moral state which despite superficial revival under Josiah made it inevitable so it's coming soon lesson is coming regardless okay Zephaniah is in four parts and then he goes and breaks it down and part one the coming invasion of nebuchadnezzar a figure of the day of the lord or to say a type of the coming of the lord day of the lord all right so that's that's what we're going to be into the whole book of Zephaniah okay all right I will consume this is f naught 1 3 I'll consume man and based I'll consume the fowls of the heaven and the fishes of the sea and the stumbling blocks with the wicked and I will cut off man from off the land saith the Lord verse 6 and then that are turned back from the Lord and those that have not sought the Lord and are inquired for him where 7 hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God for the day of the Lord is at hand for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice and hath made his guest to me I think of wedding supper he bid his guests in the young in the one the gospel drew a couple of my guests he bit his guests and people were found not worthy because they made excuses I've got to stay on Facebook I've got to the regrets Almanac I've got to go to Walmart all this thing brother down refers to those are impeding or hindering us because we do those things instead of spending time with God right hey so will be found not worthy - if we're not careful right to be bitten - this wedding better yeah verse 8 and it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord sacrifice that I'll manage the princes and the King's children and all such as are clothed with strength and peril let's train to peril semi maybe not having on the wedding garment right if you have on some other attire besides the wedding garment the Holy Ghost the word reveal if you have something else on besides that your own ideas your own doctors your own talking us even right here sitting in this church we can still have our own ideas sit against the Word of God yeah that strange apparel is it there a story like that somebody showed up at the wedding supper in the wrong ya environment and somewhere in the Gospels now Jesus I think told the parable I guess terrible huh he said oh yeah and so that'll be sang with us clothed in false doctrine and now there's 12 and it should come to pass at that time that I will search for Islam with candles and punish the men that are settled on their leaves that say in their heart the Lord will not do good neither will he do evil my camp out on that verse for a few minutes let's break that down ok so now right there were says say in their heart what is that they haven't been going out say it out loud they might not even realize they believe it but down in their Park they believe it and they prove it be gone by their actions they stay in their heart no works that's unbelief because they say well the Lord will not give good evil the day of the Lord not here at simulations long ways off the rest of the law my office and some other day all right Louisville not do good or evil and enter these aren't what he called agnostics the people that don't believe in God or the devil typically really be right agnostic with either not them these are believers the church members you'd say and they believe in God they make me come to church and read the bottom of pray every day but somewhere in there that's doing is God and they're saying by their actions of staying on Facebook and staying on you know beers on that whatever you read whatever your thing is energy you know what it is hey I don't throw a Facebook I sell you to too much I need to watch myself on YouTube you know but just the thing is just anything that hinders you you fill in that blank that's what I'm saying yeah okay and really what you're saying to God is off later coming right away I know you're coming someday but not today maybe not tomorrow maybe not for one more years that's what you're saying to God in your heart it's hidden but God knows our hearts least means dregs means sediment and liquid sinks to the bottom right so the definition I looked up refer to wine said if you have to sit on a fit old ferment and I guess the heavier elements will settle at the bottom right so somehow thought has to come and serve us up a little bit what is our dregs what is our sediment in our life it's sin that almost all the draping of cussin I mean no you ladies may all have it we come here with it that's why we're here in church we're trying to be delivered from that we were built to us then something will believe that confusion that misunderstanding whatever it is leaves us that's god's turn us up and delivered us and thanks from those from those things israel sometimes that sentiment will cause us to saw a plateau and will stop going on with god it's been a few times my life where god had to come and really spur me good to get me to going on someone all right let's sit here punish the men that are settled on their leaves that sailing off the world will not do good neither will he do evil I know I had something else to say about that it would probably come to me but let's go on to the next from here now we are born in sands what are this talk about a song if you want which is our unbelief this unbelief Romanians until the word of revealed to us unbelief is what weighs us down spiritually and if we're not careful will cause us to settle on our leads okay just sit down cabbage down camp out plateau whatever you want to call it it's some I did throw down a while ago I've got it for this [Music] okay I'm gonna throw this out there and get a whole lot of time to really think on it but sometimes we have these we hear these feel-good doctrines and all of a sudden we just buy into it and just comes it's just once like we think it's just it feels so good it has to be right you know the seed doctor makes you feel good because someone tells you that you came there in their natural birth with a seed of eternal life laying dormant and then at some point the light strikes that seed and you come to life but it makes you feel good like just God thought so highly of you that you put something you didn't put in someone else okay I believe happens is that lines up with our unbelief would come with unbelief in us and that often sounds good because of your unbelief but when the word is when the true word comes forth it doesn't sound exactly right sometimes at first and you have to think about you pray back said what is there something to that or is it not but it's more simple in it and it makes God not a respecter of persons it's not a filled with a doctrine okay maybe sometimes the reason we feel good about some of these false doctrines and tend to follow a mess because of unbelief on the contrary people say bro down you've confused me what does that mean because the unbelief in you doesn't match what he's saying this because he's telling you the truth does the job of what's in you because of the unbelief that you came with right so you say brother Dale you confuse me he said no I just exposed your confusion I exposed your unbelief you came with it and I'm trying to get you out of it yesterday I was filming you trying to deliver you from that is it a matter of were just wrongly educated or wrongly understood because something I've been I believe wholeheartedly i doesn't brother Dale confuses me every time he says I mean well because of all the indoctrination that I was raised Baptist that yeah wrong and you know I have to think about that but I know we're all coming with unbelief just because of that verse Laurence Sam shakily iniquity spouts remote from Lotter because of the act between Adam and Eve okay and that or not me but Adam in a certain time and especially the fact that even took on the wrong word okay she didn't stay behind fell behind work but I think around I think and then man can correct me if I'm wrong but brother Dale the way he brings out he likes to bring things out sometimes any like riddles to make you think and look you know search things out more because then in the next service he'll add a little bit more to that and you know and lisas over the whole podcast and everything but I yeah but and so that's why a lot of people may think of or they'll confuses me but you sometimes kind of just throw something out there it is I'm gonna confusion it's um I make the analogy with ink that there's this little toilet in my brain that pushes out all the old doctrine you know where my brother Samuel says this and another hard one he says it takes a little while yeah I'm at that total of a flush and get rid of all the garbage you know does it make sense it did late it fills in all the little nooks and crannies it's uh and it's hard to do that well I think most everybody here would agree that when they started coming here it took a long time for me I came out the Baptist Church there's a 17 year old kid straight into the US and I said that I think for a long time my wife she came to your works that wasn't teaching all right doctor we're all gonna start coming in this work yeah the sheriff on your I cuz through words and falsework can't provide it at the same time when the truth comes in the fall slate and then when you when you when you hear it like 10 years ago if I heard that message I say when you drunk you're crazy because of the Baptist and then I went to enjoy it and I met this guy who was a Bible believer and he start teaching I go that's right that's right that's right and then he had a sense of humor and repent just don't have a sense of you and I stayed with him a couple days to learn all this and I got baptized in this little cesspool in the name of Jesus Christ and I I knew this is the way it's gotta be and then I offered him somebody for his time and first church and everything you wouldn't take it would take it so I slipped into my pillowcase and I called him later and he goes all he said would you really think you're funny don't you I think novel areas but since then it went when yesterday who's talking about favorite Bible passages yeah the one about being starved for the word and that one hit me right but I have to say that's my favorite yeah because for the past eight years past for since I've been in Greenville County Pickens County I've been starved for the true word I mean and you and you show them the Bible and they call the police and show them the Bible they start jumping up and down screaming yelling they're all right there and I like to stay home yes and I just I this park I said forget it you want me to go somewhere you fix it yeah and then I went to this I met brother Dale and other things and so non-first well you know that's the same basis I came here honest just count to 10 before you call the sheriff thanks if I can hear only some hundred throats and erogenous yeah that's what I'm you know what you start and you start getting fed that's true yeah you know you discern it it's the Holy Spirit you know because that that discernment comes from the Holy Spirit yeah because I can't do it and you know and that's truth in it it fills all these little holes and pretty soon is drawing and drawing and drawing and I guess you must give it Hitler do it okay that's when I have to - oh well basically I started to say - being patient wait on God that's not mean sitting and doing nothing okay it means you study and pray laughs the word fantasy right about the kind of quick mentee you got to come to a you know mental faith at least a conceptual understanding of the story on the page where to be a message during the Bible or not equipment - okay not to - before the decree bring forth before the day passed as the chaff before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you before the day of the Lord's anger come upon me seek ye the Lord all unique of the earth which have brought his judgment seat righteousness significance it may be he shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger after a few more these real quick if you stop singing god you cut off the channel between you and God by seeking after day by reading prayer listen to sermons said early have a constant communion with Christ it's F&I 2:15 this is the rejoicing city that dwell carelessly that said inner heart I am and there is none beside me how has she become a desolation a place for beasts to lie down in every one that passeth by her shall kiss and wag his hand all right this sounds like the Catholic Church or denominational trip because I will say the senator heart they all say I am and there is none else right beside maybe everybody believes that their doctrine is right in their belt so long I thought that is about this kid then but done in the false vine grow grow close to the true heart if we are not careful prayerful militant watchful sincere could this be spoken word church no man the church as a whole but individuals here do we not fall into that situation and here's how I say that can be carelessness not reading and studying pray enough not enough sincerity and we are most inclined of anybody message that I know up to say I am and there is none else you know I say that because brother Dale holds such a straight line of the truth and preaches against false doctrine I sat in that pew ten years ago 15 years ago and I thought I'm safe he's in safety and sudden destruction coming right I thought I'm safe I'll call brother Bill my pastor is keeping me a rock I believe what he says but then I got a face I faced the Faust offering myself for the first time and find out that I don't know what I believe so I began to really seek and study and pray and find out what I believe in not just taking on my pastor set so you'll say in your heart pride goes before fall you'll say in your heart I am and there's none beside me I feel cozy here in my little queue listen to my pastor fight it out with these false doctrines and I sit down and I say I'm okay because I'm if he goes I'm going you know so a place for me to lie down on him what kind of Beast will come in you if you get in that position you come to sanctification the unclean spirit goes out of a man he's secrets rest he walketh belton and he can't find rest he comes back and brings $700 worth of himself and the last day that man is worse than the first it comes to sanctification he sits down he's not filled and sealed for the Holy Ghost he sits down and he's got a religious spirit or a lot of really the spirits those are me according to this verse those are the base that will lie down take up residence in you because you didn't go on simple as that I got the really hurry up well to her that is filthy and polluted to the oppressing city she'll beg mount the voice she received not correction she trusted not in the Lord she drew not near to her God did we follow this category by lacking sincerity Zephaniah 3.4 then will I turn those people that pure language that they may call all call upon the name of the Lord to serve him with one consent what would that be pure language what's that semi pure language pure means playing holy unadulterated the Lord brought us a message pitched on Christ unadulterated pure word of Almighty God in this hour a pure language that they may all call upon the name of the Lord to serve and on one consent one heart one mind one Accord if we can come to the unity of the faith and believe the message is available we just have to dig into it it's here ok John 15:7 if you invited me and my word abiding you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you okay but he works a lot when the confidence come here whom I was sent unto you from the father - even the Spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because he hath been with him from the beginning where we heard that race brother Dale man brother way always found out the attribute versus an attribute if we received after own life and his worries about even us we were with him from the beginning then by that eternal life okay before it was an attribute there was the attribute propels me say is that the nine three twelve I'll also leave in the midst of thee and afflicted and poor people and they shall trust in the name of the Lord he sounds like the attitudes right the beach will inherit the earth persecute bless or even your persecuted for us to stinky showers leave the team porch spirit so there's a thirteen my dog and then says the master accept an amendment of Israel so not do an equally more speak lies become a deceitful time they found in her mouth their mouth where they shall feed lie down and then shall make them afraid no fear they're not little flaw verse 17 the LORD thy God in the midst of these mighty he will save you rejoice overly with joy he'll rest in his love he will joy over they were singing once I get two more punch there we go okay basically there's two things I want to get across out of these quotes a brother Brennan okay you can actually read frame from the church listen reads from it and still be missing your day that's something that I was doing for a long time we must have more sincerity and desire for more thought you're really bizarre more of him he was showing by your actions you cease whether you really sticking or not okay I just gave basically two quotes one about sincerity one about why you can be sincerely wrong thank you the work is the main thing the word but we've lost the interest it takes a circumcision of the holdings of the Spirit to bring life there's work some serious going away it's been a time that we've noticed the great sincerity when a man knows that it's wrong for these things to creep them to stir and then don't tell them about it where is that beeps in Syria okay let me skip on ahead to one that's about the other side and sincerity alone will not work it requires going on with God if you are sincere to me it it sort of gets God's attention said hey I'm doing what you said to do then he comes to you with more work do you walk into it or not okay because Cain was sincere Mabel is nice here Cain was not accepted because his offering was not right for the revelation today we'll have Abel tried to correct came God said once you be accepted if you come I think so he had the opportunity I think he didn't do it he said this is it take earlier you stop right there and be sincerely wrong okay let's get them down to one one before that before this yeah I'm sorry - yeah so if God just respects worship sincerity sacrifice came was just as dust disabled but if it was by revelation that he understood but it was by revelation that he understood that it was not apples that his parents okay that's what I got a really really quick question about that's why these are so mean and hateful I think they know that their dogma is breaking down and everything they believed in is breaking down because if you ask them a question they don't know because they only know this they only know what is sent to them and no subscriptions you know and that they know and that's making a beam so it ain't gonna be long and they're gonna collapse and then their face [Music]
