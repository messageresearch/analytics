all things are possible when Jesus is here amen hallelujah aren't you glad for that promise that all things are possible if Jesus is here good to be with you this morning and we'll turn to Exodus chapter 21 and Leviticus chapter 25 and read I I know we can't put it on the screen so you'll have to get your Bibles out and turn the pages Exodus chapter 21 Leviticus chapter 25 and uh so so glad that isn't it wonderful how the Lord just provides when you need a piano player and need a a song leader and everything God just puts everything right in place and we we almost have a full church this morning so this this is nice let's just go to the author before we read Exodus chapter 21 Lord we're so grateful for your many blessings to us this morning Lord Lord we surely know that Lord the little group up there in Tennessee this morning will be blessed and we just ask your blessings upon them Lord upon brother Wade as he brings to them and Lord I pray Lord that you'll be with us Lord as we read your word and open it up to us Lord to give us encouragement in this hour that we're living in and strength Lord and granted Lord that you'll just fill at Liberty Lord to be with us Lord L and to Lord to speak to us Lord Jesus that you'll anoint my lips to speak exactly what Lord the congregation needs to help them on their way be with us now Lord we pray in your name amen now I just want to take a little topic this morning the Jubilee sound and read from Exodus 21 and Leviticus 25 and exodus 21:1 says now these are the judgments which Thou shalt set before them if thou buy an Hebrew servant six years He Shall Serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married then his wife shall go out with him if his ma if his master hath given him a wife and she have borne him Sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her Masters and he shall go out by himself and if the servant shall plainly say I love my master my wife and my children I will not go out for I will not go out free then his master shall bring him unto the judges he shall also bring him to the door or unto the door and his master shall bore his ear through with an awe and he shall serve him forever and Leviticus 25:8 reads if you're able to flip over to Leviticus 25:8 it says Thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven time seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 40 and9 years then sht thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month and the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land and to all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now I think I I I think this morning uh we were actually we seems like we've been traveling a lot L lately and we've been we were traveling up north and we we were listening to an audio book about the the history of George Washington and the how the nation was founded and just listening to how the the uh the I guess you'd say the old-timers the ones that the founding fathers um all that they fought for to give us Liberty from the the tyranny of British rule and and to establish the uh colonies and all those kind of things you begin to think about what we what we have now that we we're able able to live in Freedom and able to believe the way we we want to and and uh so freedom is certainly a great thing and to think this these little scriptures that we're reading this morning are about Freedom the devil you know has so many people Bound in a uh Bound in the Captivity of their mind and mind battles and you could list off so many things but you know maybe maybe this morning if we really examine ourselves maybe the devil's got you bound this morning so you know you hear that gospel the gospel sound the Jubilee sound that that you have a right to go free and um you know uh brother in Genesis chter 15 it says in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abraham saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the Great River the river Euphrates so we've got a promise now that we've got a promise that Abraham's natural seed had a promise that all that land was given to him but we've got a promise spiritually that Abraham's seed by Christ the the the the faith seed that we because we're in Christ we have a we have an inheritance that we have access to that in other words we don't have to be bound by the devil anymore we don't have to be bound by what the devil is putting on us that you got an inheritance this morning that you can possess that you can have access to now you know so many times people people don't realize and that's what the gospel was given for people don't realize that that they're living uh under bondage to the devil that you know you you you certainly we've if you've been delivered you can look with discernment at at people at Walmart and people there that you go to work with and see that the the their way that they their language is they're cussing constantly and uh I know people that I work with they can't have happiness without drinking that Corona at the end of the day drinking that beer and and and they don't they just don't have they don't realize that they're in bondage oh to think that you can't have H to not be able to have happiness without the devil giving you his little his little peill or his little bottle or something that they can't have happiness without going to Las Vegas and getting all into that you see what the devil does is he gets you in bondage and and and they don't realize it oh but then you hear that gospel sound the gospel the gospel trumpet the the voice of God preached across the pulpit to tell you that you don't have to be B Bound by the what the devil's got over you that you can you can be loosed from all of that then then things begin to change see God gave is Israel a possession and he gave you a possession now you might have to fight for everything that you're going to ever get you might have to fight for it you might have to take up your sword like Caleb did who said Give me my Mountain but but still nevertheless God give it to you if you're willing to go after it now brother R said in the message adoption he said inheritance by predestination I inherited something what inheritance there had to be somebody leave me an inheritance why you say Jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance oh to think about that this morning that to think that you got an inheritance sitting here this morning you've got access to what to to all these promises that God laid out for us that they are yours that he promised that you can have it he said your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God give your your inheritance your inheritance was first all to think of that you go way back in the mind of God that he was thinking about you he was thinking about what he wanted you to have before the world was created before the Angels were created he was thinking about you thinking about you sitting in this church service this morning and thinking about thinking about the power of the Holy Ghost he was going to give in your life thinking about overcoming power that he was going to give you and thinking about that he wanted to bring you up to a maturity where you didn't have to take nothing from the devil no more that you could give it back to him now in other words before there was a world before there was anything there was a God and you are part of that God by the new birth that you to think now that's what your inheritance is that you can be a part you're a part of that God before the foundation of the world now that's what Jesus Come To Die to not to bring you an inheritance but to bring you back to that to pay the way so that you could be restored back to that inheritance oh to think to think this morning maybe you're wondering what's what can I have access to God promised it God promised he promised the Israelites that all that land that they could he promised Abraham everywhere you put your foot you can have it and he promised that same thing to you whatever wherever you could put your foot by faith you can have it you can have it this morning if you need healing you can have it if you need a baptism of the Holy Ghost you can have it if you need eternal life you can have it if you need overcoming power this morning you can have it why because he promised it and now now we've got a we've got a heavenly father that when he makes a promise he doesn't just make it just to be saying words but he makes it he's going to stand behind everything that he says he's going to stand by his promise he said I'm not going to set my word is not going to go out and return return void it's not going to fall to the ground it's not it's going to accomplish its purpose so this morning God is looking for a little some good ground with that seed of the word can fall in somebody that will say if God promised it I want to take God at his promise I want to accept it now you think now brother R said in a type or figure we take Israel because it's the Jubilee time and the church was given a portion which was Christ himself that was poured out by the Holy Spirit into each heart that would receive it and become sons of God or to think now this morning that you got a starting place just like the children of Israel when they were covered over by the blood and that and and and they were HD away and they as they were eating the lamb there before they started on their journey and they you got a starting point just like they had a starting point but the starting point is not where God wants you to end up he didn't want them to just stay down in Egypt he wanted them to go through all the all the Wilderness Journeys and wind up in the promised land and battle it out with the Philistines and the amorites and the moabites until they accomplished everything that God saw that they would have possession of and B drive out the Giants oh see you got Giants in your life too you got giants that are fighting against you and God wants you to have faith and confidence enough in what he promised to drive out every giant to take up your sword of the word and the shield of faith and to drive out everything that's coming against you and brother BR said when those children were born when the when the baby was born all all the uh the the all the the children of Jacob uh Abraham Isaac and Jacob he said when the baby was born and the mother labored utter the voice of this patriarch it positioned and placed him in his in his place in Palestine hundreds of years later oh to think now when you were born you come forth crying Abba Father you come forth with the spirit the spirit of adoption why cuz the spirit of adoption cried ABA father cuz God wanted you to be positionally placed what positionally placed in his word where the word grabs a hold of your life and puts you right where God wants you and where does God wants you to be this morning he don't want you to just be a little baby be he wants to be he wants you to be a mature grownup Christian that can take God at his word and say say I I believe every word in other words I believe that all things are possible that's what God wants us to be built up in the faith precept upon precept line upon line here a little there a little until we believe that when God said it he's going to back it up he said he brother Bown said you Lutheran that believe in justification your inheritance don't lay there if you're called oh God wants us to keep moving on he said if you're just a Lutheran that's all the farther you get you Methodist and nazarenes and Pilgrim Holiness and Church of God who believe in sanctification the killing of the evil that's se you taking out the roots of evil oh what he say you belong across the river to think about this morning that that they thought that they that was good enough what they had he said that's why Pentecost failed because they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they failed to keep going but God said I I want you cross the river I want you to take possession I want you to be eating that new that old corner of the land I want you to be eating the God wants us to get into the Mysteries get into get into Rapture building messages he said but to you men and women that there's something in you calling out the Deep to the Deep there's a Jordan yet to cross and a land beyond the river and adoption number two he said did you notice Moses that great miracle performer that brought down Israel down through the land and brought them up to the promised land but did not Place their inheritance to them he did not give them their inheritance he led them up to the land but Joshua divided the land to the people and Christ brought the church up to the place to where their possession was made to them was given to them just the Jordan the cross but the holy spirit is the one who sets the church in order the Joshua of today puts the church in its order given to each one gifts places position how does it set the church in order oh as we hear the word we're getting under subjection to the word and it's sliding us into place it's telling Housewives how to be a good Housewives it's telling husbands how to be a good husband it's telling a father how to be a good father it's telling us how do we need to be B baptized that we need to be born again it's telling us that we need to grow in Grace and knowledge it's telling us we got to be adopted that there's more to add it's telling us how to do all these things it's telling us what is the evidence of the new birth and as we get under the word it's putting us right where right where we're supposed to be positionally placed the word is placing us the word is what is claiming our lives and moving us into position where it wants us to be oh you you realize what a a believer in subjection to the word what power it has over the devil where you can stand in confidence knowing that knowing you know where you come from and you know where you're going cuz why you know who your daddy is and any belever any real Son of God that knows who their daddy is they got confidence that they're dad will back up his word they've got confidence they can they can believe what he said oh that's the kind of position that the church wants to that God wants the church to be in he wants the church to be to be to have faith their faith to build up where they just believe that no matter what the devil throws at them that God is able why cuz he promised it and brother ra said he is the voice of God speaking to the inner man that Christ has saved the Holy Spirit now do you get that much of it he said now we're getting over into the book of Ephesians the same way he's positionally plac in the church where they belong Joshua placed them in the natural land now the holy spirit is placing the church positionally in the land that they and the position that they belong in their inheritance oh you see what your inheritance is this morning your inheritance is not just a drop of the Holy Ghost your God wants to just feel every fiber of your being with the Holy Ghost he wants to fill every fiber of your being with his word he wants to just just build you up so that God can become God could just Tabernacle himself in you oh that's what that's what we're talking about here they started off on this journey down to the bottom but they had been to move and what was it the Holy Ghost placing them till the Holy Ghost to take them across the river and put them in the promised land and positionally place him where in maturity and adoption it's it's surely surely we can know church this morning that this adoption time it's time where all these things that brother random preached about all the Believers preached about down Through the Ages now it's coming up to a head where there's there's Saints on the earth now that believe fully what brother random taught believe fully what Christ taught all these things that have been laid down Through the Ages and brother Ram said when Joshua divided the inheritance to the people each person was placed positionally exactly the way these Hebrew mothers named those children exactly the way that when they were their mama was crying out when they were born when they were born crying out where are you going to be placed when they come up where they were in the promised land they were placed exactly according to that prophecy y he said the Church of God begin to get in its place that's then's when the Philistines will go to back and up the shorts will go off hair will grow down faces will be washed cigars will be missing why why now cuz what it is it's the church beginning to get in place the word claiming your life and bringing you under subjection to what God to what God Said positionally placing the church where it absolutely stands in Christ now there's there's our inheritance this morning so when you hear the gospel trumpet say saying that you can return back to your what are we returning back to we're returning back to the original Faith the original Power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost loosed in the church that's what the word the purpose of the word was for when you hear the word it it provides an Avenue for the Holy Ghost to be loosed in your life the word the word being being preached is not supposed to Bar the Holy Ghost but it's supposed to loose it because that's what you're inheritance is the Hol the your inheritance is the life of God and the church the life of God and the believer and brother R would say if somehow or other The Inheritance and the individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by God there come a year called The Jubilee year if he was a Freeborn and a true blooded Israelite no matter who held the possession it had it had to go back to him free he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't have to pay he didn't have to do a thing but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance oh if we could just really think about this morning that you don't have to do a thing it's not by worse it's just by faith in what Christ has already done we're not saved by by working it up or or or trying to do something trying to do anything but it's it's all on him that Christ paid the price for us Christ is the one that that did everything for us and we've got a right to return back to our inheritance brother R said he had a right to it it was a god-given right because he by Grace had inherited it and it would have been given to his fathers and handed down year after year no no matter what had taken place if he lost it it must go free it meant Grace is is Grace is a way provided for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance oh this morning if we could understand our rights that God we've got a right to return back to what God promised John in John chapter 10 it says the thief cometh not but to for to steal and to kill and to destroy he said I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly because that's your inheritance this morning that the devil wants to take it away from me and say you can't have access to it but Jesus says you can have access to it oh we've got that promise in act chapter 2 238 that the promise is unto you and to your children whoever wants the Holy Ghost whoever wants more of God you got a promise laying there in the Bible oh thank God that we've got a father that will back up his promises thank God we've got a God that will keep his promises and if God promised it then you can just Bank everything on it because God is going to back up his word and he promised he promised that it's your right youve got a right to claim any if God promised you got a right to say I I can have access to that Joshua 1:9 he said have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withs soever thou goest oh if we could to have confidence like that to know that the same like Joshua said that I know that the same God that was with with mooses Moses is going to be with me we got to have the same confidence to know that the same God that was with William brandham is with us oh that'll give us confidence in this hour and Joshua chapter 21 he said there fail not all of any good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel all came to pass and we can have that kind of confidence looking into the word that if God spoke it he's going to bring it to pass and Ephesians chapter 2 he said for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus under good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them that that's our that's our right that God is fashioning us up what is your to to be like him to walk like him to be able to to think like him in Romans 8:29 he says you are predestinated to be conformed to the image of the Su Son of God that's that's what God wants you to be to to be like Jesus that's what your inheritance is Christ made a way this morning that every fiber of your being could be filled up with him because that's that's what God wanted you to be your inheritance is in Christ and the message all the days of our life brother BR said now we hear so much about it we are free oh we live in a beautiful America we are free all the air is full of it books are wrote of it thousands of them but you are a million miles from being free oh to think of that this morning that so many people in America think they're free and they're living in bondage maybe this morning some of some of us sit standing here this uh sitting in here this morning think we're free oh to be free that's what the gospel is for to give us Liberty from the bondage of the devil he said you're a million miles from being free you're not free don't you be deceived by that America is one of the greatest deceived Nations and in more bondage than any place that I know of they're worse and bondage than communism can put them in com communism come communism can only hurt the body they can only put the body in bondage but when the Devil comes in he puts the soul in bondage and man is a slave America is a bunch of slaves you might be a slave to Pride that's PR you might walk up and down the streets and go through every store and every fashion that you can see on television and go from store to store trying to buy something you become a slave to it you become a slave to your dressing you become a slave to your money that's the only thing that you can think of is money grab and put it here if you do that you're a Slave oh think this morning what are you a slave to if you're a slave to clothes if you're a slave to Hollywood to Fashion of this world that's what the gospel message was to to to to tell you that you don't have to be a prisoner to those things anymore and the devil will convince you that you're happy when you're you got to drink that alcohol and smoke that cigarette and do all those things but like just like the Israelites laboring down in Egypt making bricks without straw the devil telling them go when I say and come when I say and arise when I say and the Taskmaster whipping them and tell them to go back and forth that's exactly what that this fix that the devil will get get so many people today the devil will tell everyone around tell you tell you that you're happy that you're in prison that God don't even love you anymore until you're you're glad that you're in the prison house but this morning there is a way out of servitude to sin it now you know you know this morning think about what the devil does to people he'll put he'll put those thoughts in their mind that this is just the way it is and and it begin begin to make you feel like so dejected and down and feel like you just can't get out of the situation you're in and you start thinking that I can't break free I just can't break free of consuming things that I shouldn't I just can't break free of looking things that that I shouldn't but if you'll just look at Jesus Jesus is the one that already paid the price or you think about that when they were in uh coming out of Egypt and they started getting bit by snakes and many of them started dying and and God told Moses to just take a brass Serpent and put it on a pole and lift it up and if you just look at that brass serpent that you'd be delivered now that it it seems until you really apply it until you really take the gospel message it it it it doesn't seem like something maybe that would take effect but try it sometime try I tell you if you if you really change your diet and start eating the word you cannot stay the same you you start eating the word and start gobbling up the word you there's no way that your life will stay the the same you look to what Jesus did and start putting your faith in what go what God Said and begin to just meditate on the promises that he made and there's no way that your life can be the same you start turning loose like we were preaching Wednesday night turning loose of Pride and turning loose start start looking at God and say I I I'm not I I don't want to be like this anymore I I I don't want I want you to take a hold of my life I want to be under under subjection to the word I want my life to be changed and something will begin to break free you start thinking I can't break free of thinking God doesn't love me look at the cross where Jesus blood where Jesus shed his blood for you start thinking I can't break free of doubt and worry look at the stripes where he bore that he bore for our SARS and for our in our iniquities oh that that's the Trap Of The Devil to make you get all doubtful and worried and fearful and everything but just look at Jesus cuz the gospel message is to bring Liberty to you that's what the gospel the gospel is for somebody that's not in their right mind so that's what the gospel was sent to do to deliver you from the prison house to give you a purpose and what what is your purpose to know that you have an inheritance to come to your inheritance to claim that inheritance that is what God's purpose is for you to be delivered from the world for you to have a sound mind for you to have healing in your body for you to have peace in the time of trouble that's what I believe I believe that this is a positive message that we preach this morning we've got a positive gospel a gospel that in the when you're down in the valley down in the dump said we've got a gospel to pull you out and lift you up 1 Peter chapter 3 chapter 1:3 says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope we've got a lively hope this morning by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance what kind of inheritance Incorruptible and un UND defiled and that fadeth not away thank God for for an inheritance this morning that is Incorruptible that when you get under subjection to that word you can live according to the word I thank God for a holy a gospel that'll make us a holy give us a holy life undefiled and that fadeth not away this is a gospel that'll make us make us live like Jesus and it says reserved in heaven for you but what does God God wants somebody that will face face the devil that will that will look at the devil square in the face and say I've got a God that made a promise he wants somebody to do like Caleb and'll take up that sword and go after him and we'll face the Giants and the Jubilee Year brother Brown said men and women in our country and everywhere else has sold their out to sin drinking gambling carousing doing things that they ought not to do and become slaves to the devil he said I met a young lady here not long ago she said brother bradam I'd give anything if I could only break this this band of whiskey she said I started when I was a little girl went with a boy that drank we started mixing drinks and I become a perfect slave to it if I don't have it she says i' just go wild if I could only get rid of this I said you can't do it yourself but I know someone who could break it for you the Lord Jesus Christ has come to make you free I I'm thinking this morning of so many testimonies that I've heard over years I'm thinking of some a man that told me years ago that he was smoking cigarettes and one day he just kept laying it before the Lord and one day the Lord just took it from him think about all these examples of people that battled things out and tried to do it theirself and then they just laid it before the Lord and the Lord just took it away that's why in the message to Paradox he he would brother R explain that that you you are a miracle so many times we're looking for miracles when it's happening right in front of our eyes right in our own lives that God can take somebody that's that's that's just on the on the in the in the ditch on the side of the road covered in mud and pull them out and place them in church and change up their life and clean them up that oh that's that's what real justification and sanctification is in PR practice that God can take that mury muddy drinking vessel out of the ditch and pick them up and clean them out and wash them off and put them in church and fill them with the Holy Ghost and now they got a change life that's what your inheritance is this morning this church oh this morning if if you don't realize what God wants you to have access to God don't want you to live under the bondage of the devil and where the devil's just tap dancing on your head and dropping all this kind of stuff all over you well you can't live right and do right and can't think right and walk right God wants you to live an overcoming life thinking about the Egyptians in bondage Moses tried to deliver Israel with his own strength and now how many so many times we try to do it with our own strength Moses got up and he Saidi just going to deliver the is Israelites with without meeting God first and he and he ended up being a murderer because of it you you might think be thinking this morning well I just don't understand why it don't work you know so many people they'll go to the doctor and the doctor will prescribe them some medicine and they'll go go home and they won't take the medicine and then maybe wonder why it didn't work why why am I still feeling pain in my hip when the doctor gave me some pain medicine well you got to take the medicine you got to do what the doctor said and you got to do what Dr Jesus said if you take the medicine that then the medicine will have an effect and there's so many people around the world today saying well the medicine don't have any won't have any effect because they look at how other people are living they look at how the uh gospel is being preached in different C circumstances listen I can't tell I can't help how some people preach the message I can't tell how helps how some people live I can't help all those things I can't help the people that didn't do what the doctor said I can't help the people that didn't take the gospel the way that it was prescribed but I know one thing that if you'll take this gos peel the way that Jesus prescribed that it'll do what he said if you take the peel the way the book said it'll work and and how will it work you take it the way that the doctor prescribed and it'll it'll heal you it'll heal you because he promised it would you take it the way the doctor prescribed and it'll change you cuz I know I know person it it'll change it'll change your thinking it'll change the way that you walk and the way that you live and the way that you who do you associate with and I've seen the effect that it's had in others and I I know that it'll do what it's what God said it'll do so if you say if you're saying this morning what I don't understand why it don't work oh you can try to prop get yourself you can try to get yourself out like painting a falling down house you can just keep painting a falling down house but that house is going to keep falling down or propping up blocks every time they fall you can try to keep just keep propping it up oh but if you do like Moses did and get that burning bush experience On The Backs side of the desert and get a real relationship with God oh Moses when he got in front of that bur and burning bush and heard that voice say take off your shoes for your on Holy Ground he realized something was different than than what his his mama had told he had heard from his mama all those years and walked and walked and tried to make it work but one day when he got in front of a living God and everything changed you get in front of a living God one time and find out you'll find out what's right and wrong you'll find out that that this gospel message really does work in Romans chap 3: 19 it says now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin what what's that talking about you need God you need the grace of God in your life you could try to work it up and try to meet all the requirements of God and yourself but it takes God working in your life to bring you out of bondage and I thank God that's God that's what the gospel is for to show us his Grace Grace that God has given a Grace that God would come and die on the cross for us and shed his life for us so that God would get put his life in the heart of a believer that he would live it inside of you in John 8:34 it says Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever committeth sin as the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed and brother bam would say he said the church now is like Israel God by His Marvelous Grace without any organization or anything else he called Israel to his health he called them to their inheritance and Grace furnished them a prophet Grace gave them a pillar of fire Grace gave him a lamb sacrificial lamb Grace give them power Grace Grace give them Deliverance Grace give them Victory Grace give them all these things and he said they danced in the spirit and shouted and praised God about it oh to think this morning that we were in bondage we were in bondage in a denominational system and Grace gave us a prophet and Grace gave us a pillar of fire and Grace gave us the power of God restored back in our lives again Grace gave them a lamb sacrificial lamb Grace did give them power Grace it's Grace to be a son and not a servant it's Grace not to be bound by all these things that the devil wants us to be bound Grace that you don't have to be a servant maybe this morning you're sitting here and you're thinking about these things and you're still in bondage but you don't have to be a servant anymore God's given us Grace to be a son and exodus 21 verse1 it says now these are the judgments which Thou shalt set before them if thou B and Hebrew servant six years He Shall Serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing to think this morning that you can be free for nothing that you can be free and you don't have to pay anything you don't have to do anything all you got to do is just look to Jesus I think now a man would lose his inheritance that he could not buy back himself and he'd find himself working in service servitude to a Master until that debt was paid off helpless under the power of his master whipped and beaten but every seven years a message go out that he could go free for nothing every seven years there was a set time that he could go free oh to think now looking down through the seven Church ages every every every age there's been a time where people could go free if they would just hear that gospel call in Genesis chapter 17 it says my Covenant will I establish with Isaac which Sarah shall bear and to thee at this set time in the next year talking about a set time there's always a set time and there's a set time that you can go free in first Samuel Samuel chapter 13 and he carried seven days according to the set time that Samuel had appointed but Samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him there's a set time all through the scripture and there was a set time when the people could go free and be delivered and you could get a oh that set time the mystery of the Seven Stars in Revelation chapter 1 which thou sawest in my right hand there was a set time every every church every time a church age a church age messenger would come forth and preach it was the time for the people to go free if they would hear that message that was delivered and you don't you can go out of the pawn shop for free it's time to go out you don't have to pay the minister you can go out for free you don't have to thank anybody you don't have to give a speech you don't have to be a preacher you don't have to make a donation you don't have to be a big shot you don't have to know a lot all you've got to do is look to Jesus I I think this morning that that's the best deal in 2,000 [Applause] years oh we've got a message to preach this morning that's we've got a message of Grace that you've got a right you've got a right to not be in bondage anymore I I I believe that this is the hour again of Jubilee brother R would say it's the time of Jubilee what is it the Jubilee is the time the time of deliver the time of restoration where you've got a right to have the holy ghost power in your life and brother would say uh that little person down in servitude he said he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't have to do a thing but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance he had a right to it it was a god-given right because he by Grace had inherited it no matter what had taken place if he lost it it must go free it meant Grace is a way provided for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance oh we've got a right to get back to the power of God we've got a right to get back to the original anointing that they had in the early church age brother R would say he said we'd have it we've got it too easy we get slothful we get to a place where we don't want why why do we get why do we get slothful I wonder oh Caleb when they said when they when they told him what that you got to right to that mountain he didn't just sit there and maybe prop his feet up in his in his recliner and say well it's mine I'm just going to look at it no he grabbed his sword and he went after it oh that's that's what we got to do is is go after what God Said we've got a right to and not be slothful he said we get to a place where we don't want to move on because everything is just handed to us it takes sorrow and tears and sweat and prayer and faith and promise to move forward in the power of the holy spirit that Zeal and power that they had in those days has long time vanished from our assemblies I was I was telling somebody recently over over over food while while we were eating together that I think the worst thing that can happen to a group of Believers is where they just begin to lose their Zeal and just begin to not care anymore oh Caleb cared about that mountain he was think about he was an old man by the time they got to the promised land but when they told him that this is your you got a right to this inheritance he was going to go after that no matter if there was Giants on that land he was going to go after it he said that that Zeal and power that they had in those days has long time vanished from our assemblies he said I'm afraid if the windows would be shut out tonight people would run every way and never come back again cuz he's talking about a church where the windows got shot out and the people were praising God and the bullets didn't hit nobody cuz they had such a Zeal they they they were so on fire for God the Holy Ghost anointing was in that place oh this morning I wonder do you hear the sound of Freedom if you're if you're in bondage that that sound of freedom is still calling what is it it's the gospel Trump telling you that you don't have to be in bondage to the devil anymore because in Isaiah chap 53 he said sure surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him strick and smitten of God and Afflicted he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed we've got confidence in these promises that are laid out for us this morning that if he promised it that's that's something that'll give us strength and encouragement in the hour of need or when you've heard that gospel trumpet it'll cause will cause an effect to happen in your life if you really open up your heart and let it be sewn in the good ground of your heart it's going to have an effect in you what it'll do it it'll make you repent it'll make you it'll cause you to be stirred it'll cause you to be stirred up it'll cause you to hunger it'll cause you to cry out it'll cause you to come to church it'll cause you to open up your Bible you'll listen to the message yes that's what that gospel Trump does why cuz it had that same effect to that little servant Bound in Bound in slavery down there in in the promised land when they'd get into a spot where they couldn't pay their bills and they'd have to sell theirself to another Israelite and for seven years but then when they heard that gospel Trump sound oh they didn't just sit there but they they dropped that hoe and they they knew that they could be free brother Ram said in the Jubilee year the message Jubilee year he said I remember myself when I heard that good news come to my heart as a little old sinner boy laying in on the hospital bed the doctor says you got three more minutes to live I heard a sound from Heaven that told me Jubilee year was on I I wonder this morning if you could look back and remember when you first heard that sound that the Jubilee year was on he said I accepted the Lord Jesus turned loose all the shackles of sin and said to the devil you can't do me any more harm because I have given my life to Christ Jesus and you can't whip me anymore since then he's bluffed me lots of times but he's not been able to touch me since because he's just a bluff I can hear his whip cracking and popping and so forth but it don't do no good because he can't get me because I belong to the Lord now that's right oh to think about this morning that when you hear that gospel trumpet you can throw that back in the devil's face and say I got a right I got a right to what my daddy said I got a right I got a right to the New Birth if you're seeking the new birth this morning you've got a right to it if you're seeking adoption this morning you've got a right to it why why cuz my daddy promised it servants have their reward servants have their reward but you are sons and Galatians chapter 4 it says because you are Sons God ha sent forth the spirit of his son and your hearts crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant you're ain't a servant no more but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ oh to think this morning that if you're a son not a servant then that makes you entitled to everything that God has access everything that he own if he owns the cattle on a thousand hills then that means you got a right to it cuz you're his son he's your daddy oh what a privilege it is by the new birth to be able to know who your daddy is to be able to be identified with him when we can look into the Bible and be identified with all these Scriptures it proves who we are it shows us who we are like Josiah when he could look back and read in First Kings chapter 13 that was written 350 years before he was born and see how it was written of him that he would be a king one day and you and I can look into the Bible and see and read that God wanted us to be adopt adopted that he wanted us to fulfill the things that were written of us in this hour oh that we've been resurrected from dead Works to serve a living God not to be slaved to sin brother R will say now the he he Heathen slave could not return back to his inheritance he didn't know nothing about it he a heathen means an unbeliever an unbeliever in the word they don't know what you're talking about they want to call you a holy ruler they want to call you like they did their forefathers 50 years ago in Louisiana crazy like it was back in the days of Paul and the way of heresy that's the way I worship the god of our father see the Heathen don't know nothing about it oh oh to think this morning now if you want to know what it means to be a Son of God and what you've got access to then you got to be born a Son of God if you wanted if you wanted to know what it was like just speaking rhetoric brother Brown would even say that he said before I could act as a human before I could walk like a human before I could talk like a human I got to be born to human a a duck's born a duck a duck knows what it's like to be a duck a raccoon's born a raccoon it knows what it's like to be a raccoon a human you're born a human so you know what it's like to be born a human but you got to be born a Son of God to know what it's like to be a Son of God you got to be born to know what you to to know to realize what you have access to Hey brother said in order to be a Son of God you've got to be born of the spirit of God then you become Christlike and do the works of Christ then you're not funny to them people a human acting like a human is not funny oh when a Son of God acting like a Son of God is Not doesn't look off it doesn't look funny sitting here in church it won't look out of kilter if you're if you're really born of the spirit of God if you're really born and what is this gospel message that I'm preaching that you can have Liberty that that you can come out if you're if you're bound by change of sin that there's a way out that there's a way that you can come forth you can come forth through the Matrix and be born a new your life can be changed and your thinking can be changed the way that you are can be Chang I thank God for a gospel message that actually will correct the way that we were born naturally oh we come to this world with our old carnal mind with our carnal nature we come into the world the lusting after things that we shouldn't be and looking after things that we shouldn't listen I'm preaching the truth to you now this morning you come to the world wrong and now maybe this morning you might be called up looking at pornography and looking at things that you shouldn't be doing but there's a gospel that that if you let it grab a hold of your life it'll change you it'll change you where right now you might be in bondage to sin and bondage to shame of this world but let the gospel get a hold of you and it'll change it it'll correct it so that you don't act like that anymore right oh if you can just receive Liberty and no longer be bound by change of change of unbelief I got something that will take God at his word come what may that's what that's what this Liberty in Christ Jesus has given to us that we can believe God no matter what that can identify itself back with the word like Ruth oh you think about Ruth now Ruth did not even have an inheritance Ruth was a moabi what inheritance she did she have she didn't possess any inheritance but she was brought into an inheritance by the work of a redeemer and we've got a redeemer who can who brought us back to our inheritance she had a redeemer that she trusted in she had she put all of her confidence in and laid At His Feet until he throwed over her a type of the Holy Ghost His Garment oh church do you remember your own personal Jubilee do you remember when you come out of bondage now if you don't if you don't maybe you need one this morning and that's what I'm preaching this morning that there's an opportunity for you to have your own Jubilee where you can throw your hands in praise and worship and and Trust in a redeemer just like Ruth did y'all help me preach this morning you know sometimes sometimes you know you're preaching a sermon and it might not really be for for for you sitting there in the Pew but a real mature believer will recognize it it might be for that person sitting over sitting over next to them or somewhere else in the church and they won't draw up they won't pull back but they'll they'll say I I I whoever this is for I want it to go out I want it to help somebody and they'll start they'll they'll really start pulling pull pull now I I think I think we can be happy about the me happy about the gospel being preached even maybe if we're in a state this morning where maybe it doesn't particularly apply to your particular moment in your life maybe you're not in a season where it's going to help you as much as maybe it will somebody else but pull pull nevertheless because if it'll help somebody we're all trying to grow up to the Capstone [Applause] don't don't draw back when the gospel is preached I I I like it when I when I hear somebody preach something even if I've heard it a thousand times I I like it just the same it makes me happy to hear somebody preach something that I believe in now in the in the message the mark of the beast brother R said the trumpet was the trumpet and he sounded it and when he did every slave could go free back to his home if he was out in the field chopping with a hoe and somebody over here whipping him with a whip and he hear what was that what was that gospel trumpet sounding the good news throw that hole down and turn right around and say you have no more rule over me going home to my wife and kids I was sold over here in slavery oh to think now that's the effect that the gospel will have and it will have that effect where you can look around and say I I ain't in slate one day you can turn back around and say I know I ain't where I used to be Something's Happened to my life and oh can you remember church that time that you tossed that ho down and Rose up in Victory and and said oh the devil the devil don't have any more claim over my life he said you hear that trumpet sound and that means that I'm a Hebrew what does it mean when you hear that trumpet sound and you really recognize it you really recognize that gospel voice it identified you as a son it identifies who you are he said that mean when you hear it that means that I'm a Hebrew and in the Old Testament it means that I've got a right I am a Birthright in man I have a right I can go free without anybody's money not if you'll do this or you do that see the whole thing was Grace not if you will but if you'll hear the trumpet oh oh if you if you can hear it now and the Bible says that his sheep know his voice oh if you can recognize who that is calling you if you know who that is you realize this morning that hearing produces Freedom if you can hear it and you recognize it and it's not just like thundering brass a sounding symbol it's not just a bunch of noise to you but you really recognize that God is telling you you can go free then you can go free he said if you hear the trumpet see hearing Faith cometh by what hearing now not just listen with your ear but if you hear that means you understand it you accept it I hear you I believe it see it's hearing what is the gospel trumpet the good news the Holy Ghost is here how do you know it is watch it work see what it does yes sir it's the good news the good news is the Holy Ghost is here the whole the good news is you can have it you can have it if you're born again you can have more of it you can have as much as you can as much as you can hold this morning cuz God wants you to have so much until it just fills every fiber of you he said he could go free didn't have to pay nothing didn't have to do nothing just get up and go that's all he had to do go back if he knew the sound of the trumpet but he had to know the sound of the trumpet for they were sons of God oh to think about this this morning so many time so many times people sit in the church and they hear the message being preached they hear the word going over the pulpit but they just can't hear it and maybe it becomes something boring to them where they just they just they just don't see the value in it oh oh my to think that the devil can get somebody in such a pickle where they're they're happy with the situation that they're in they're happy with the life that they're living they're happy with their bondage they're they're fine with just playing video games 24 hours a day and and and and and just living a life that don't really have any meeting but God wants more for you than just that am oh if we can hear what the gospel is saying to us and you know brother R would lay it out he'd say so many time in the Old Testament they get in they get into a city they get where into a place now you see if you were out on the plane there were no walls and you could hear that gospel trumpet playing and you just youd drop your hoe and you knew you were free but if you were in a city within the wall then you couldn't hear that gospel trumpet and you couldn't go free in Leviticus 25:30 it it says and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year then the house that is in the wall City shall be established forever to him that bought it throughout his Generations it shall not go out in the Jubilee so in other words if a man bought property inside of a wall City then he had one year to redeem that back if he sold it and if he did not redeem that back that property if it was inside of a wall it had to stay in there it couldn't go free your property if it was inside of a wall City it couldn't go free it was bound to stay there they were over the wall they never heard the Jubilee the trumpet sound and they sounded a trumpet and it could not go free now that's so many times what we'll do we we'll we'll allow ourselves to get walled off from other people and how do how do Walls Start walls you you get walled off by believing Your Den what your denomination says you your denomination says that they have a do Doctrine about the Trinity or whatever they say the baptism and you get walled off and you just can't hear that trumpet sounding that tells you that you you have a right to go free proclaiming what you have access to now now a lot of uh uh there's a lot of other ways you can get walled off too like you can get walled off just believing maybe like what your mama and daddy said Your Mama and Daddy might have some skewed views about about things like sometime I've heard years ago I heard somebody say well you just don't even need to pray anymore and see if you start adhering to what what people say you get walled off and won't be able to claim what God what God wants you to have access to oh but if you could come out from the wall I thank God this morning that we've got a kinsman redeemer that could go get us from within the wall City and bring us out and brother Mar would say some sometimes your kin oh that kinsman redeemer now he's put his life in you and that means now you've got Kinsmen that can go go to where you are all walled off and pull you out and tell you about the gospel tell you about he said he said a pilgrim out there in a bond sold out to the rich cities out there sold out into the riches of organization but a Kinsman brother who knows he's out there some night put his Bible under his arm go after him put his Bible under his arm and go into that wall oh you got all those walls around you separating yourself from other people pulling off to yourself he said a Kinsman because he's got the same Spirit he's born in the same family go call him out of that group thank God for a Kinsman who can go get you when you're walled off thank God for a Kinsman who come down and got us when we were walled off thank God for real brothers and sisters in Christ who can come and witness to us and tell us about the truth when we're walled off but I I think God this morning that we've gone beyond the camp we've gone Bey we've gone beyond the walls of organized religion we've gone beyond something that can just be argued about we've gone beyond those things brother R said we haven't walled ourselves away from it so far that we got to hear what somebody says instead of what thus sayith the Lord is I can hear what the word of God got to say about it now is the hour of Jubilee come back to your original inheritance to a real Holy Ghost again and he'd say it's time to rise be sons of God in the name of Jesus Christ and rise to a place so you can return in this Jubilee and hear the sound of the trumpet of the Gospel of the word of God what what is this Jubilee trumpet sounding that you've been anointed to B you you've not been anointed to bondage but to Liberty you've been you you been anointed to Liberty that you can go free oh I'm think about in the book of Acts what the Holy Ghost did for those Believers when when Paul and Silas were down in jail and the Holy Ghost they had those the prison bars all around them and and change all over them and but the Holy Ghost come and set them free the Bible says at midnight Paul S Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them and immediately all the door doors were open and everyone's bands were loosed oh that's when you hear that gospel sound and you begin to recognize your Liberty oh watch something happen sometimes it takes a little praise to watch the chains fall off but you start you start praising God like Paul and Silas did and something begin to happen you start thanking him and watch the blessings come you start thanking God and watch something begin to happen thinking about Daniel down in Babylonian captivity when he he began to look at the what Jeremiah had prophesied that that they had an inheritance that they had a right to come out and it was about time the the time was right for them to come out it it was time for them to return and he began to look and oh that's what Daniel 70 weeks is about that it's time it was time for them to come out and it's time for us to come out and then moving on into the the uh the restoration of Israel in that in that last seven weeks uh God the the the message is about Liberty when when Jesus pulled up in that Scroll of Isaiah there in the temple and began to read from Isaiah and identified him with that scripture he was reading that the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings under the meek he sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and in other words he was identifying the Jubilee coming out Liberty to the captives he was identifying the Jubilee with preaching cuz that's what the Jubilee trumpet is the preaching of the Gospel oh you hear the preacher the good news of the Gospel like Daniel I believe we're going back we're going back to what God to the original faith brother R would say let's go back to god let's go back to the eego food let's go back to the leadership of the Holy Spirit let's go back to the word of God let's go back to the fast and pray back to the original back to what God wants wants us to have access to and then in Ephesians oh in Leviticus and I'll be closing here in just a minute in Le Leviticus 25:8 it says Thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years un thee see every every seven years that could go free but not all if you got married to a wife during that seven years you couldn't take her with you there was some things that had to stay back but every 50 years the whole thing could go free and verse eight it says Thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years under the seven seven times seven years in the space of the seven Sab of years shall be unto thee 40 and9 years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month and the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall H the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family I want to thank this this morning that there's a reason why God had to send a prophet so that we could have full liberty down through the seven Church Ages Every like just typing that every seven years they could go free they could go free in their soul oh but here in this final age God has given us a way that we can go have complete Liberty in our soul and our spirit and our body that our body could be changed and you know to think now that the only requirement for Liberty is you got to hear that trumpet now now when they were when they when they heard that trumpet blast they they might not have been able to see the person blowing the trumpet as long as they heard it now now see there's many of us sitting here this morning that you know we didn't get to fish with brother brandom we didn't get to be in his meetings but we heard it just the same and see that's the only requirement that you hear that trumpet and and and we heard that trumpet blast that signifies that that we've got a right not just to be born again in our soul and we've got a right not to just be uh cleaned up in our spirit but we've got a right to a body change we've got a right to the Mysteries and and brother we we'll say we'll say it like that many of us here tonight have escaped the bondage of the world our souls have been sealed in but but in our spirit and our spirit and our body we just can't quite grasp the things that God wants us to have faith in we still it's what it is it's a disease of the spirit that even though you're born again of the soul that your spirit is still the SE then you think you you start you it's those mind battles you think I'm not I don't think I'm good enough I I wonder if I'm really born again like sister Shepherd laying there on on her couch and she had that dream and where she was wondering if she really was born again and she woke up and brother BR she told that dream to brother BR brandham and he preached the message a stat the stature of a perfect man why she needed an answer to that that's why God had to send a prophet to give us an answer to these things why so you would have confidence that you're born again so that you'd have something to throw back in the devil's face when the Devil Comes you with all these mind battles oh you see that's what God that's what that's what your right is your right is to know where you stand in Christ oh that the Mind battles in the spirit the disease of the spirit where you think I I don't know if I can take a body change oh that's CU your faith hadn't quite been built up to where it needs to be but God by the word he gave us a go to build up our faith to where you will know that you can take a body change you'll say maybe I don't know if faith will move a mountain for me for me there's the kicker I don't know if it will move a mountain for me oh but you got to know that faith will move a mountain from me if I've got a mountain in my way that God promised it and God's Gonna back up his word brother R would even say it we have confidence that God will move a mountain we have confidence in what God says but what about what you say God wants you to have confidence in what you say he said if you say what God's already said and you're filled with the Holy Ghost it's the same as de he speaking oh if we can God wants us to have that kind of faith that kind of confidence to believe that whatever you say you'll say maybe this morning I don't know if the Lord wants to heal me I don't know I don't know if the Lord wants to heal me of this two toothache now see brother Ram will say you you you can't hardly have faith for a toothache but you got to have faith for a body change we need we needed something to take us to higher Heights and that's what that was a type of in the 49th year where the man would come out with the trumpet and the the high priest in the 49th year blow that trumpet in time blow that trumpet in a space of time to take us to Eternity the 50th year takes you into eternity where you've been take you oh that youve been delivered from in your soul and your spirit and your body you've been taken up into higher Heights into a change what is it a release a release that takes you from the bonds of the earth that takes you from this from this Mortal realm that's what this 49th year message is supposed to bring to us he said the church was to go on to the full promise the church tonight should be in her Splendor of Glory she should be waiting for the coming of the Lord instead of that she's scattered everywhere wondering which is right is this right is that right I'll join this and go over here and down that oh return get away from those things oh that's what this message is for to build up our faith and our confidence to where we know what's right aren't you glad this morning that when you hear a preacher preach you know whether he's preaching right or not I know so many so many years I've heard people talk about that they they they struggled with just battling out people would say something behind the pullit and they didn't know whether it was right and they'd have to go research it out and you God brings you through those through those things through those times oh but God wants us to be up here where we have confidence and what is truth and what is right and we're not scattered around by on every wind of Doctrine he doesn't want us to just be like little children Blown Blown by every wind of Doctrine but rooted and grounded like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water and he would say when you see the trumpet of God sounding the word of God and God vindicating it with signs and wonders as he said it would do if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound the chief Captain won't vindicate the call now brother that was a stomach full the chief Captain won't vindicate the call for he said in Mark 16 all the world and these signs shall follow them that believe that's the chief captain in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues oh he'll vindicate he said that's the certain sound the certain sound of the Gospel trumpet and we've seen it it Vindicated the gospel trumpet what does it do it declares his presence and his will for you the sound of the Gospel trumpet what what is that sound of Freedom declaring this morning as we get ready to close I really am about to close it's declaring that you were in him before the foundation of the world it's declaring that you had an inheritance that God thought of before the foundation of the world that God thought about you and knew that you would come to it it's declaring that there was a mystery in the back part of God's mind and you are that mystery that that gospel s that sound of Freedom this morning is declaring it's the seven Thunders declaring your complete Redemption that's the Seven Seals breaking the unfolding you your the mystery of your complete Redemption that's what the gospel trumpet sounds to you it's it's the sound that you are not under Satan's Dominion anymore that you don't have to take nothing from the devil that you can stand and oh stand like Caleb did and say I'm I'm taking that mountain I might be be an old man I might be feeble like Abraham did but if God gave the promise to Abraham then how much more will he fulfill the promise to a born again child of God that God that has the life of God living in you oh and that sound of freedom in Revelation chapter 10 John was acting out receiving that sound of Freedom when he said give me that little book give me that little book but you keep reading on down and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and kings that sound of Freedom you take when you heard that sound of Freedom now you can speak it out to others you can speak it you can Echo it out and you can Echo out that I believe it like hady Wright sitting in there listening to brother R talking about how that he's still Jehovah Gyra today yes he's still the same God and she echoed out I that that's nothing but the truth and it was a little woman speaking what do we got this morning we got a woman speaking back this morning a woman speaking the bride has come to maturity a place where you she can say the same thing the same thing that God spoke through brother Brandon the sound of freedom in you brother or Jesus would say in Matthew chapter 16: 19 he said I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of
