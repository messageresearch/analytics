1) 63-0322   THE FIFTH SEAL  JEFFERSONVILLE IN     FRIDAY_     
     O Lamb of God, come forward, we pray. We call on You, Lord, the great Redeemer. Come forth and show us Your plan of redemption that's been hid through the years, breaking this Fifth Seal for us tonight, Father, and revealing what's beneath that Seal for us, that we might go away a better Christians than we are now--might be better fit for the task that lays ahead. We ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.

«  25       †        Well, now, I get started on them subjects, and we just talk on, and the people around the walls and standing in the halls and the rooms and so forth. So I'll get right straight to the message, and I want to say this... Now, I want to give thanks to Him Who's omnipresent, and that today, not knowing one thing about that Fifth Seal, it came in that same mysterious way this morning, just about a hour before daybreak that when I was out in prayer.

3) 63-0322  THE.FIFTH.SEAL_  JEFFERSONVILLE.IN  FRIDAY_
«  215       †        Now, notice. Now, in the 9th verse, souls under the altar. Now, here's where I'm going to get some real disagreement. But just watch just a minute, just... See? I thought that too, but it didn't come that way. We've... I've always thought that these souls under the altar were the--the--the martyrs of the early church, and I'm sure that Dr. Uriah Smith and every one of them says it is. See? But... I thought so myself. But when the Holy Spirit showed the vision to it, it wasn't; it isn't the souls.

«  216       †        Now you, now you say, "Well, I--I don't know about that." Wel...

before it was put on the altar it was picked up high and lifted up he had to be put on a cross so everybody could see him hey man same way with your life high and lifted up amen so we hold him up lift him up this is all about Jesus Christ it's not about us it's not about William Branham it's about Jesus Christ hey man some Jesus and what he did for us we thank God for all the others we think God for every person has helped us but able one man can save your soul maybe but one man can change your body and that's the Lord Jesus Christ now you got him in your heart then you're a-ok hey man hey man hey okay then you can get started with all these other things but don't ever forget Jesus Christ because he's the same yesterday today and forever I want to take just a second thank you all for the gifts that were given last Sunday and appreciate it Merry Christmas to all of you we won't see each other till Wednesday after after Christmas we'll have regular service and and I'll be speaking again - so get brother dealt voice a little bit of time to recuperate man he's recuperated since the last time I talked to him Thursday buddy I didn't know but today but look at he he hardly coughed any at all so that's wonderful you know thank God for that that was the Lord we believe in he'll do the same for each and every one Terrence and some of the ones that are not here - so I also remember Luis and Christine and the kids you know they've been gone for a while so some of you are following her block up little Bella's blog and then your Facebook page and all those but Luis sent us a Marco Polo have you any of you seen the iguana that they had yeah they ate that thing Lewis ain't either Lewis there's nothing else he could have said but this it tastes like chicken so I'll just have to believe what he said hey man long as they make a chicken and a beef and the pork iguanas Wade out on my list so may have to but not yet remember next Sunday no Sunday service lies roads Joe Canada put it so well if you come you'll be here by yourself just go ahead and have a prayer meeting in the parking lot but we won't be here so also remember brother Chris long he'll be flying in on Friday to be with us for the watch night service on Monday and Joe got that wrong this side bring hors d'oeuvres finger food and this side bring finger food he didn't do it the right way so anyway does it mean to be on the 19th village ill fornia be preaching for us January the 19th that'll be a Saturday at 3:30 so come expecting God to do something for us hey man if you got your Bibles let's turn to the Book of Revelations and get started and I'm gonna background a little bit for the for the sake of our of our dear brothers and sisters that come over all the way from there from Arizona New Mexico to be with us so well and that's okay so many of you said you enjoyed Wednesday night I thought I kind of muddled it up a little bit but I some of you some of you've already come in about enjoying it so we're gonna kind of cover a little bit more today but there's more to that fifth seal than just the fifth seal Jude that's why I said that once that seal opens that when the seal comes off it's okay to know what that seal was but I want to know what it sealed up it sealed up something that we couldn't previously see like I said the last week and the week before last this is the and we've been going in you see what it's got us we're still here we need to go in that direction it's not Mama's walking on the streets to go with Jesus now no she's in the sixth dimension she's in a theophany and she's waiting on us to bring her back here hey ma'am we're not floating on a cloud playing hearts amen well that's what we thought here no matter what we thought father son Holy Ghost was the right baptism Trinity was right and the first seal was the Holy Ghost now every bit of that was not right going in that direction we got to go in that direction we got to change our way of thinking just like I told you many times about all the you praying for the sick and all that and that's fine but it's what's it got us we're still here we need to do something and yet say well you gonna trying to manufacture something I'd rather have a little fire the property God said then no fire at all because I I don't know about you but when somebody like brother Lyle that I've known for 30 years or longer brother dick now they've come down to the last part of their journey and you see brother I'll have to walk up here with a walker that gets me people right here that don't get me in my spirit realm that gets me in my soul that makes my soul when our soul starts longing after these things and groaning and travailing waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God will quit drinking milk will start eating some meat amen it's good day it's good to drink milk milk it's okay Danny of milks okay I've never eaten one I've never drank milk with a snake and eagles don't eat don't drink milk Eagle starts out eating meat mommy eagle just got to chew it up so they don't choke but it's still meat so I think we need to eat meat every meal revelation 6 verse 1 verse 9 we're going to start on the fifth seal this is part 5 but we got to get a few things out of the way before we can start and we'll start a little bit with the Thunder underneath this seal but we're gonna have to cover this will be transgression part 2 because there is a place where Israel fell from - from a place to a place when we read that Sunday but we're I mean Wednesday but we're gonna read it again if that's all right we're gonna do a lot of Bible reading today and I hope that's alright man cuz like brother Dale said we we got to see all these things come to pass they've been written on paper for 1,500 years they've been in the mind of God since he turned sins back and for eternity before the eternal but they've got to be literally you know what Jesus stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world right but he had to literally come down here and do it if it stay in the mind - God wouldn't do us any good he had to come down here in this dimension die the death do exactly what the word says and he's doing exactly what the word says now so let's see revelations 6 and let's pray before we get started this 15 the Lord thank you for the day think for the hour that we're living thank you for the greatest people that ever walked on the face of this earth they sitting in this building tonight father I pray that you just be with us now be the active participant in this service you do the speaking you do the revealing because without you Lord it'll be just a meeting of minds father just be with the ones that are sick raise them up for your honor and glory Lord we know sometimes our body gets a little bug and it has to get rid of it we know that the Prophet told us that many times but Lord you're the healer you're the one that does that but you're also the protector you're the one that as we prayed this morning that will keep it from coming on us Lord I pray this you'd just be with us now and just cover this congregation with the veil of the Holy Ghost then our minds and our thoughts will be on you just for this little season a little time Lord that we have to talk about you Father be with the missionaries in a foreign field brother Luis and all those little or doing their job pray that you just bless them Lord to take care of the ones they are speaking to father bringing back safe just bless each one thank you Lord for the ones that are here today we actually just be with us during this season Lord that we not forget we know that you weren't born on December the 25th but Lord that was the day when you got born again in my heart and you came inside and that was my Christmas Lord you wrapped the gift up and put it inside me called the baptism of the Holy Ghost Father we pray now that you just take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit and further min of this service amen and when he had opened the fifth seal bowed Annie's gonna get to think when we read I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth in white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled you may be seated the Lord had his blessings reading the word thank you buddy thank you brother thank the Lord for brother Danny ten years ago he couldn't walked up here like that amen that's right but thank God he can do it this is good weekend go hunting everything you know something god I will restore you know you keep that oh you keep patting your heart because he'll restore you he will restore your your thinking and all the things that you need in life he will restore it for you so let's get started here real quick just be patient maybe a little bit a little bit longer today than usual but I got to get to this point so now we're going to review the seals just for a second bring them up on the board that's what we did this Wednesday night but we're gonna do it again we've already been through seal one steel one we started back in February of last year so yeah I am so slow but it's meticulous and if he's it's like it's like we were talking at the post office one day this week they were talking about the kids line and I told you all the other day about the kids line I said well why are you flipping cuz their line you told them the biggest liars ever been told right and you know what we told it Sloan we believe it the whole world believes in Santa Claus right but it's a lie we told them they didn't get it on their own somebody had to tell them so listen if I take maybe if we turn that around and if we tell you the truth long enough you'll believe it it's the truth and there ma'am that it's not a lie that it is the truth amen so now what we were talking about in the seals just for just for a moment we see that the seal that seal had something covered up right membrane says brother Branham showed in the illustration this is the way they used to have a book it wasn't like this it was in a scroll and it had a seal on it had a seal right here and that book was sealed with a seal now you can't read what's inside that with this seal on it so when brother Branham came the Prophet came in God through William Branham toward the seal back this says the wild horse rider is now the Antichrist and then it always what it always was and of course it wasn't it was the Holy Ghost and it turned into Benton oh it always was the Antichrist man had just what went in this direction when the Prophet came he turned us in that direction because when he pulled that seal off the seal showed that this seal was that the what was covered up was sealed by the Antichrist the white horse rider but now underneath there though there was something written that's the Thunder that's what I want to know once that seals broke it's broke Jesus broke him 2,000 years ago preaching them in Matthew 24 we just didn't realize what he was doing to a God sent a prophet hey Ben they're right so it's not something new but what's new is is the Thunder that's underneath that seal and then the Thunder listen underneath that seals what's going to change our body the tunnel is underneath our seals like what brother Joe said it's going to what teach us how to be a better Christian teach us these things that we should have known before but what we've been going in this direction right here and then while horse rider is the Holy Ghost no the wild horse rider is the Antichrist and this is what's covered under that seal you had to turn completely 180 because remember what does repent mean turn around and go another direction not go back in that direction going another direction all right so we got to bring our mindset to this direction to where that we understand obviously folks this is the way God's always wanted us to go but when this I was thinking yesterday you know brother branham talks about the seals he talks about the first seal when they saying went out well see that's how the Santa Claus thing got started a saying went out a saying went to a deed a deed went to a doctrine it was all false the saying was false the deed was false and the doctrine was false father son Holy Ghost said listen folks Mollison hold those baptism though it was accepted by 99% of the world never was right it's always been wrong God has winked at our ignorance for going in that direction because man has kept telling us all of my life I'm gonna take what Jesus said and you ever heard that before I have jesus said baptizing them father son Holy Ghost oh that's what we're gonna do you just can't get them to see that what jesus said and what Peter said is the same identical thing so that's why brother Branham had to come to restore us back to the faith of the fathers restore all the doctrines back restore us all the way back to work the right kind of worship conduct order in doctors in church or everything he turned us back right ain't know what's supposed to turn our heart back turn you've heard that we're turning our heart back in other words we were going in this direction and the Ministry of Elijah turned us amen so now as we were looking at the seal seal number one is the wild horse riders the Antichrist that's all rights a man but underneath that seal we see that there was a white righteous church already working in the first three Church ages is that Alright work can't say man that's better when y'all open Crescent presence day after tomorrow you're gonna be going let us say Amen just a few times if you don't let's practice hey man thank you thank you you can keep saying if you want dude it's all right they gonna bother me like brother Brown said that don't not scare you say hey man I'm not scare you hey man so ceiling up thank you that's enough sale sale number see that good thank you so seal number one is the white horse riders Antichrist right but in the first three Church ages there was a what there was a white righteous church working in the first three Church ages we bring through this everybody ought to say Amen to this cuz we've done been through this since February of last year all right now the second seal when it opened it showed a Red Horse is that correct say man and then we saw the Red Horse being the killing of 68 million Christians the seal was that that saying became a deed that deed became it became a doctrine that doctrine became a person all right in this age right here in the Catholic H all right seal number three is the black horse which the black horse rider was what the man aged the lion ox man and the eagle is that Alright say man all right lying ox man and Eagle that all right all right this age was what this was white red black and pale which is everything mixed together in this fourth age line aged ox man in Eagle Lian Li Owen not lying lion ox man and Eagle we see these first four seals when they break they show us then the plan of redemption not just the anti cross not just no no it reveals Jesus Christ and when that revealed Jesus Christ to the to the prophet of God the Anti Christ had to ride away here stands a lamb tonight with a book in his hand and there goes a while or something had left that prophet what what had left him them old ideas that he had we read this I'm gonna read it again remember he said it changed my thought process why he thought - while horse rider was holy go this direction now the wild horse rider was the Antichrist he had to turn in his own self at the turn and going this direction second sealed third seal fourth seal even in the fifth seal we're gonna read it he said this is against all my thinking he thought them souls under the altar was what the Christian Church that had died what direction is that the wrong one he had to turn and see that it was a totally different group ma'am dead okay so as we type this and we see the Thunder under the seal the Thunder under the seal shows what quiet justification red is always sanctification the statue of a perfect man what cleaning the trash out all right then we see the fourth seal which is a new birth you say what's that got to do with black listen if you're not dead today if you're not dead today you don't have the new birth amen if you're not dead I've said before you can't divorce your old man your old man's got to be dead before you can marry somebody else hey man natural and spiritual so you can't divorce you men hang them up in the closet why so these not dead listen we're bribed we're female we can't have a living husband to living husband right you know I got one what other one's got to be dead so your first time who's got to be dead amen so the new birth seal number three types of new birth or adoption which is we're going up to a higher plane folks we're not down here at the bottom where the babies are a man you stay a baby it's your fault right your fault you stay a baby my fault if I stay a baby but you sit in this church long enough if you're a baby here's your fault that's my Christmas gift to you still number four is what it's all the three seals wrapped together right white black red mixed together makes a pale horse well what does justification sanctification the baptism the Holy Ghost do it makes you the word made flesh but you've got to have all three the three completes the birth remember you can be justified without being Saints five Saints fine without being justified but you can't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not be justified in sanctified you can have an anointing that's the whole problem and our message we got a lot of anointings but when you become the Word made flesh Jesus Christ wasn't just anointed he was God now he was anointed for his message if for his ministry for his three and a half years I'm gonna give you a Christmas present maybe you'll remember less when we get into the seventh sale I just thought about this other day I want you to chew on it I give you something to chew on every once in a while that okay now the Seventh Seal when the Seventh Seal breaks their silence in heaven for a half an hour that's thirty minutes right all right that's thirty minutes and who is the Seventh Seal Jesus Christ right he is that seal silence in heaven for thirty minutes or a half an hour how old was he when he went to the river Jordan it was thirty you remember they called that from his birth to 30 of the silent years just think about I'm mulling something around a little bit Lord maybe maybe we'll find out what that half-hour silence is you know what though he wasn't dead he was doing something the world didn't know a thing about it he just pops up at 30 years old starts his message hmm hmm he just pops up in 30 minutes and starts his message okay so I'll let you think about that because we got a long way to go we're still in still number 5 but just think about that that's why they call it the silent years maybe you said well silence in heaven nothing was going on well God wasn't in heaven shut per se he was on the earth during that time hmm unless you think Jesus wasn't God whatever anyway see you number 5 that ain't right that's right amen I probably never preached nothing like that the Lord Jesus didn't either so now when we come to the fourth seal when it opens from brother Brown said the fourth seal opens the rapture takes place under the fourth seal amen the rapture takes place under the fourth seal I'm quoting of what he said so don't look at me cross-eyed like I don't know but I read you the quote the bride goes up after the fourth seal because when the fifth seal opens it opens in a totally another another dimension there are no combat beef there are no line ox man and eagle which is what the holy ghost in the church ages in the believers and then so if you don't see it on the fifth fifth seal then there must be something happen we took a rapture we go up God comes down and starts dealing with Israel so when the fourth seal opens when we get the rebel let me put it that way when we get the revelation of that fourth seal then that's going to hopefully change our body but we must have sealed number five because if you take seal five six and seven and put them well that's just to the Jews well that's okay but it ain't just it's to the Jews but you got to bring seal number five back over just grief there's a handle on the bottom of that somewhere you got to have seal five six and seven because when we go in the rapture it's went to me is when the seventh seal culminates because who takes a rapture you me I thought Christ come back for itself the bride they ain't no two people I'm telling you the more I see it the more I see it there's people in this message or tunas they man they're tunas well Jesus is over yonder doing something and I'm over here 2,000 years ago Paul said it was Christ in you the hope of glory so we can stand on the in the end time and say I and my father are one not I and my father one I'm pointing to my natural father but I am my father or one I came from God and I'm going back to God amen not only excite you that don't stir you so yes bones fill out your bowl anyhow I like what Aaron says so the fifth seal now wants the fifth seal the fifth seal to me and as we see the seal open what is the fifth seal well it's it's the souls under the altar card how long fifth seal Jew but now what's that got to do with me and you there must be a thunder or a revelation underneath that that tells us something about ourselves if not then we just leave five six and seven alone let's go to the house no five six and seven two mirrors of the motive the most important for our body change you heard what I said for our body change because seal 1 2 3 & 4 happens to your soul at the new birth then you turn right back around and start up the statue of a perfect man who put that chair there justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then what then we start with a headstone these seals have never been broke to anybody but you and me come on brother brown told him on the seat seal he said you're not getting this it's not even for you I read you the quote 20 times so who's it for everybody dude through what we did Wednesday take your finger and go it's for that person you're pointing that I can say it for me I don't know if it's for you a black says for me like brother Dale said that's my Bible I love what brother Brown said he said garden he said God gave me this eye he said God gave me this eye he said now it's mine it's my eye so when God gave me the Holy Ghost it's mine it's not yours it's mine it's not even God's anymore no it's mine you know what he's pleased to dwell in you I hope so now as we go through the seals I don't know there's a glare on that but still we got Church ages once the church agents are over we leave a man who's talking about it downstairs this morning we're that wild olive branch that was grafted in we'll get into that in just a few minutes like I said I may be a little bit longer today but you know what you ain't got nothing else to do this afternoon will stand downstairs for two hours and talk so maybe we'll just do it up here so seal number five then seal number four one two three and four covers the church ages is that Alright say ma'am covers the church ages gets us in a rapture a body change in a rapture and gets us out of here but I'm still number five you gotta laugh it back and put it back in your experience listen this is not church ages this is you this is you you go through justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost to be the Word made flesh that's you all those other church ages are already gone their past they passed away their ideas are in the sixth dimension with them and I don't mean ideas what got them there their revelation got them into the sixth dimension and they're waiting on somebody one more time they're waiting on somebody to get this revelation it's always been there it's in the Bible we've been reading scripture after scripture after scripture where did brother Branham get it oh he just pulled it out of the air no he got an alibi ball but he didn't get it like man's tradition said he got it straight from the mind of God and it can't be wrong it cannot be wrong the Prophet preached it right and he preached it right the first time he ain't got to come back and preach it again hey ma'am is that the old me or an amen amen okay so now the fifth seal we must see now the fifth seal God is going to give eternal life to a group of people it doesn't want it didn't want it didn't know anything about God or Jesus Christ all they knew about was Jehovah and they worried you write that okay you didn't carry anything about Jesus Christ when you as a sinner so he give eternal life to you the same way the only the only difference is is we accepted it and we got it here the fifth seal Jew they're gonna get it because of something God did he blinded their eyes so that we could come in so the fifth seal then is going to cover we talked about last Wednesday listen it says souls under the altar now look this is not the altar that God is talking about when brother Brennan went across the curtain of time he didn't walk up to an altar the Bible has always wanted the altar to be where take your finger and go like that again right here's where the altar God didn't walk he didn't want brick and mortar and wood he wants right here listen that's what he came for he didn't come to build a building he didn't come to build a wooden Ark he didn't come to build a brick Ark or or a metal arc he came to build a heart with flesh flesh heart what is saying is Eko he said a new heart well I give you I'll take your stony heart and give you a pliable flesh heart so that I can deal with you because you know what if your heart God can't deal with you but if you got a little bit of God can deal with you thank God our hearts are not made out of stone it wouldn't work but God comes down to the altar so what were we talking about last Wednesday the altered is not and I had that big old word and I'm not gonna pronounce it again but the altar is not the altar what an altar is is that you are in a position and you're looking to Calvary for what Christ did for you and you're in a place knowing that God died for you at Calvary and that's under the altar so you're under what somebody that made an atonement or a perpetuation for you they're above you and they've made that atonement and that's the altar remember when brother Brandon went across the curtain of time he said I want to see Jesus the angel said he's a little higher what he was in another dimension he was in the seventh dimension where he had a glorified body is that okay but they were also remembered the sixth dimension when brother Brown went across the angel said these are souls under the altar now brother Branham put the two together and thought it was the fifth seal fifth seal sold on the altar cry how long how long ducks that was this way that was not the souls under the altar that he saw in the sixth dimension hey man they'll go to sleep on me German chocolate cake I'm fixing to get something my birthday's in a few months Thank You Aaron but this way that fifth seal Jew is not even close to what he thought didn't line up with what he had but when God turned him and he thought oh my listen let's go to number two the fifth seal you stole back now I get on them subjects we just talk on and on and on the people around the walls standing halls rooms and so forth we came to get a church falling maple stand around the walls Auriemma freezing so I'll get right straight to the message now I want to give thanks to him along the present and that today not knowing one thing about that fifth seal it came in that same mysterious way this morning a man just about an hour before now keep going number three number three please now notice in the ninth verse souls under the altar now here's where I'm gonna get some real disagreement why because of what he thought of his life all theologians thought that was two souls under the altar of the of the dead that was in Christ all right I thought that - I thought that - my thought process was that was the souls of the of the early church but it didn't come that way I've always thought that these souls under the altar with the martyrs of the early church and I'm sure that dr. your eyes Smith and every one of them says it is but I thought so myself but when the Holy Spirit shows the vision to it it wasn't it isn't the souls what brother Brown thought he thought it was the souls of these people that have been through the church ages right that that was the souls under the altar that were souls under the altar they're not crying how long do avenge our blood though two different totally different people because look the fifth seal Jew is not even under this church ages they're over here they're a special group of people right here - fifth seal Jew they're not over here in the church ages brother Brown said that I thought the same thing [Music] we said now you say well I don't know about that well now wait just a minute these are not the souls of the bride Church now what's the bride church the bride comes from seven church ages and then not the bride church not at all we thought that was the bride church waiting their souls under the altar crying how long how long let me read it again so he reads it and I keep going up see the Word of God testimony which they held and I don't move from there just a minute how long how long Lord how long wholly intrude us now judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and he reads the rest of the scripture and they go to the bottom now for they at this time if you notice this fifth seal being open the church is gone so there are no souls under the altar of the early church amen hello I'm just waking them up in the back all right well I mean you know what they leave the through your soul where it won't one of the thing it just can't be the souls on an early church why look because all these have been caught up we are actually in another dimension up here at the wedding supper out of the way of any of this we're over in another dimension enjoying the wedding supper while this is going on now watch he just can't be the soldier under the other church now please if you ever did give this attention now because this is a great controversy so I want you to listen real close now you got pen and paper write it down and I want you to notice these cannot be them Souls because the souls of the righteous martyred the righteous people the church the bride has done been took up so they wouldn't be under the altar they'd be in glory with the bride now watch for they are gone in two wraps on the fourth chapter of revelations they are taken up all right so now let's go to the next part we want to talk about just for a second then then we know for one thing's for sure the first four seals the the Thunder underneath those seals happens right here in this dimension amen happens in this dimension right here but now the fifth seal can't happen in this dimension John had to look into another dimension to see those souls under the altar put into place I don't know where you want to put them but they're actually in a place they're theophanies are in a place and that the Alpha knees are so alive till they are talking to John talking to John and they must have their memory because they're going how long how long to avenge our blood they knew how they were killed sister Jeanne in this dimension they knew that carried right over into that dimension wherever there right will read it in just a minute but now brother Branham will let me skip through this real quick brother branham I always thought that he could talk to brother Neville but not shake his hand we read the quote last Sunday that they were just wait a minute what sitting on a cloud playing a harp we'd be in trouble because I can't even play through spoons but don't look at me all you candidates can play anything look at me like that hey wait a minute what will we talk we're gonna sit on a cloud and we're gonna play a harp now we real people touch see hear them talk to them hug them they're real they're more real than you are that's our whole thinking we tell all they've they've died and went on and you're going they died one oh well please they're brand-new and you're still sitting here and you're dead old stinking body so who's got the problem that's our thinking thinking poor thing not what you know what they're over there six dimension they're going poor thing poor thing what brother branham didn't want to come back I got it right here he said do I have to go back down there and getting that thing they're more alive than we are folks they're eternal as the God Almighty is eternal there is eternal and right now you are not fully eternal I'll promise you I see a lot of gray hair even brother Daniel getting a little bit of gray hair unless he hides it but now when brother Brown goes across the curtain of time I don't pull these quotes up brother Brown says he when he went to heaven he said there's no explaining it he said I could touch them people I could feel them I could see them they talked to me I talked to them they weren't up here playing harps you know I'm floating buying and you know hold your hand up old you know you know this is what he thought well don't even touch me this is what he thought I can't shake their hand NoHo they grabbed him and probably squeeze the breath out of him my precious brother and he says right here well I cut it out of this which you know what he said he said they were all hugging me millions of them he said all those nights of oh woe is me while he was he wouid in other words like brother jewel says he said all them went away when I saw them when that angel turned and said you see that woman right there she was 90 years old when she received Christ in your meeting and he said no wonder she said my precious brother oh well there's no way could recognize her the last time he saw her that's what gets me the last time we saw Robert Tatum we'll never see that again yeah anybody you want to see Richard they're young Jesus they're so full of Oh eternal life and we go that's alright though we're getting this thing changed we're heading in the right direction I believe we've turned you know I think another day brother Brad said only the Prophet can turn a corner anyone can build a wall and man anybody can build a wall but when you come to a place to have to turn you have to have a prophet on the same people the Prophet never left us no he's here the Prophet is right here so we have to look in the spirit realm look at these theophanies in the fifth dimension cuz that is the fifth seal Jude there by all right with that say man all right so now let's go to the seal let's read the seal again this is where brother Branham when we read to seal go to the next one please and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord they're talking how long O Lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given under every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a while or a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brother should be killed as they were should be fulfilled all right so that can't be anything to do with a born-again Christian because number one you're not gonna say how long do avenge our blood you're gonna say God forgive them amen but who are these souls under the altar we know who they are they're the fifth sealed you people that were killed under Eichmann and Hitler and during the time of the Gentile dispensation then all right okay and the Word of God they held now it wasn't we look in another scripture and we may try to find it but you can read it yourself the Bible says the testimony of Jesus Christ they didn't have the testimony of Jesus Christ they had two testimony which they held which was what where it's you were God's people plain and simple where'd you were God's people and we're under the promises of God to the Jews that's all they got and then judge and avenge our blood and we know for one thing's for sure they must have went across the curtain of time with a little temperance they didn't get rid of theirs on this side to judge and avenge our blood what they could remember what happens what happened was they got killed just because they were Jews plain and simple just because they were Jesus how it's why they got killed there's no other reason there's not and white robes were given to them wherever they are and they're supposed to rest for a little season until their fellow-servants and brethren are killed in other words the ones that are going on because remember like we said Wednesday John had this vision of Patmos vision about right here right so they weren't actually killed yet it was a prophecy because that they were killed most of them the biggest portion were killed right here Eichmann and Hitler were killed they all got killed right here I don't say all but I say a big portion of them did 6 million of them did but Paul's I mean joins on the Isle of Patmos and those souls are under that altar telling him what's going to happen right and then they gotta wait for their fellow servants now who are their fellow servants and their brethren Jews we're not their fellow service we're not their brethren we're Gentiles we're dogs remember but you gotta wait till they're killed like they were should be fulfilled so that like brother Dale said now there's your example their scripture in the Bible and it has not been fulfilled yet not all of it okay it's been written on a piece of paper but in actuality it has not come to pass yet amen so it's got to though because it's in the Bible God saw it already happened so it's got to be fulfilled alright so now let's go to the transgression we're gonna I apologize for some of the words that I got to use but I'm just reading the Bible okay that all right so pay attention because remember God was married to Israel Israel was his first bride hey man Israel was his first bride well if you don't believe it I'm fixing to read it to you the Lord said unto me in the days of Josiah the king just saw you don't know you just king did you well I guess you did you're 18 you think he delivered that's now saying that which backsliding Israel have done she has gone up upon every high mountain and under every Green Tree maybe it'll wake you up a little bit there have played the harlot and I said after she had done all these things turned down to me but she returned not and her treacherous sister Judah saw it now remember Wednesday night Israel and Judas split their Kingdom for a little while they had a little feud between each other and they they split the kingdom but God didn't split them God said you both the same all right and I saw and went for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away and giving her a bill of divorcement see now look he can't she can't remember marriage and divorce he can't she can't woman commits adultery against you you can put her away give her a bill of divorcement and marry again but you women can't do that according to according to marriage and divorce you can't do that you can't give your husband a billing of divorcement and go marry again your husband's got to be diedie dead all right so I said about being born again if your husband was not dead you can't married again if your husband's dead you're free to marry the man put her away giving her a bill of divorcement yet her treacherous sister Judah fear not but went and played the harlot also so they're both in the same bed together no pun intended and it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom that she defiled the land keep that in mind that's gonna cover that in just a little while defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and with stalks in other words they built her own sacrifice altar and yet for all this her treacherous sisters you two have not turned unto me with her whole heart but faintly saith the Lord and the Lord sent unto me talking Germa the backsliding Israel have justified herself that doesn't that sound like a Jew it ain't my fault all right the backsliding Israel had justified herself more than treacherous Judah go and proclaim these words toward the north and say return thou backsliding Israel in other words he divorced her but he didn't kill her he put her away she's still alive she's still alive but she'll never be her hurt and she'll never be his wife again cuz once you get a divorce you're not supposed to marry your wife again if she goes and commits adultery with somebody else the lands been polluted that's what the Bible says okay pretty plain and I will not cause my anger to fall upon you in other words return backsliding Israel come by look at the grace God's God I told brother Daniel I told him I said man there's no way man could come up with the word grief we have no grace for nobody because that's what you've done to me and I remember what you did to me and you did to that one and I did to this one and this happened to you and you didn't look at me right and a car didn't shake my hand this morning and you didn't shake my hand this morning do you say what I mean I mean now into her mind she's going well it was his fault see there's no greater than that but remember that's but grace is unmerited favor it's not one mark of anything you did to get grace not one if there was one you got to go over here put it under a column called works right because there's something you did to merit it grace is unmerited favor nothing you did now what you do afterwards there's works what you do afterwards James is right show me your faith by your works and then works his faith Express brother Brown had to preach that he had to correct get all that correct because everybody's saying what works works works works worse no it ain't works but now it is works after you get again it's what you do going up that statue of a perfect man is your works but it's not but it's not to determine whether you're born again or not no no you get born again before you even start up the statue of a perfect man a man only acknowledged on iniquity say you did it repent that thou has transgressed transgressed against the LORD thy God and has scattered the ways to the stranger under every Green Tree and you have not obeyed my voice saith the Lord turn old backsliding children saith the Lord for I am married unto you and I will take you one of a city until the family and I will bring you to Zion let's go to Ezekiel now this is going to be a little bit long reading but it's only 25 after we good now when I pass by the and looked upon thee behold now this is this is gone through Ezekiel this is let me let me term that right this is Jehovah this is Jehovah God in the Old Testament this is Jehovah talking to his soon-to-be bride because watch watch what he did now when I pass by the and looked upon thee behold that time was the time of love and I spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness yeah I swear unto thee and entered into a covenant with thee saith the Lord and thou became his mind oh how beautiful amen for a moment then washed ivy with water yeah I washed away thy blood in other words I sanctified you and I nor did you with oil I clothed the also with bra dude works he didn't spare no expense shoddy wood badger skin and I girded the about with fine linen and I covered thee with silk he didn't give him a feed sack to put on right he loved these people loved him I date thee with ornaments and I put bracelets upon your hand and chain on the neck put Jules on your forehead earrings in your ear beautiful crown upon thy head thus was thou decked with gold and silver and the arraignment was a fine linen and silk embroidered work thou did us to eat fine flour and honey praise the Lord honey is good for you and oil and that was the exceeding beautiful and thou didst prosper into a kingdom and I renowned went forth among the heathen for thy beauty for it was perfect whose are coming this which I had put upon thee saith the Lord God now the breaks go on but thou did his trust in thine own beauty and place the harlot because of thy renown and poorest outlaw fornications on every one that passed by he as it was and of thy garments thou did is taking deck is the high place with divers colours and place the harlot thereupon now for those of you that are younger there sitting in here that's not this is all an allegory I mean all the children the Bears will didn't become prostitutes physically but when you when you are married to Jehovah and then you come over here and you say well I'm gonna sacrifice to this God you've committed fornication and you've become what unclean you've become an adulterer because you have two husband or you have two people that you're claiming to be God thereby okay that did they explain enough for everybody so it's not that they while all them women know if men we're all included a man and of the garments now just taking deck it's not high place with many colors and place the harlot thereupon in other words what did they do they took everything God gave them all the gold all the silver all the things that they had and they turned them right over here and started sacrificing to Moloch and debayle and right they took what he gave them and did that that makes it worse if he can be worse the the light things shall not come neither shall it be so now that's also taking the fair's fair jewels of my gold my silver and which I've given the invaders to these images of men and did us commit whoredom with them not a natural man a God and took a style broader garments and cover us them and thou have set my oil and my incense before them my meat also which I give the fine flour and oil and honey wherewith I fed thee thou hast even said it before them for a sweet savour that was supposed to be for his wife and she's giving it to another man saith the LORD moreover thou has taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thou has borne unto me and these has to have sacrificed unto them to be devoured is this of thy whoredoms a small matter that they'll have slain my children and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire and in all thine abominations and all thy whoredoms thou has not remembered the days of thy youth when thou was naked and barren was polluted in thy blood memory back up in the first when he found her and it came to pass after all that wickedness woe woe unto thee saith the Lord God the talents also built under the in imminent place and has made the in high place in every street in other words built altar thou has built the high place at every head of the way and has made thy beauty to be abhorred it has opened thy feet and we understand as adults we know what it is to everyone that passed by and multiplies the them now let's also committed fornication with the Egyptians their neighbors great of flesh and that's the increased on whoredoms to provoke me to anger behold therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee and have diminished our ordinary food and deliberately unto the will of them that hate thee he's giving him over to people they didn't hate him thou has played the whole also with the Assyrians because that was insatiable yet thou has played the harlot with them and you could have not be satisfied now that's moreover multiplied by fornication in the land of Canaan and the child dia and yet thou was not satisfied in other words they not satisfied with any of that how weak is thine heart staff the Lord God seeing thou doest all these things the work of an imperious woman you would think if grapes didn't take over he would have killed her right if grace didn't take over he would have killed her in that thou built this non imminent place in the head of every way and make us the high place in every street and have not been as a harlot and has not been as an harlot as now scorn is higher but as a wife that committeth adultery which taking strangers instead of her husband they give gifts to all but thou give us our gift to all the lovers and hire us them that they may come into the oh never side for that them is that enough he's put her away thus saith the Lord God because dye filthiness was poured out in thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with all thy lovers with all the idols of thy abominations and by the blood of thy children which they'll just give unto them behold therefore I will gather all the lovers with whom thou has taken pleasure and all them thou have loved and with all that thou has hated and I will even gather them round about against Eve what are they now they're compassed about Jerusalem what everybody that Israel played the harlot with at this moment today present hate them Egypt Syria demand I ran Iraq they want Israel to be just done away with they want them to if they disappeared right now they would not be crying in the Middle East well that's what it is right there God has gathered all the ones that she had pleasure with with whom thou has taken pleasure in all them to has loved with all that was hated I will even gather them roundabouts against thee and will discover thy nakedness under them that they may see all thy nakedness and I will judge thee as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged and I will give thee blood in fury and in jealousy that's pretty that's kind of far fetched to come back from don't you think but thank God for God's grace and mercy Book of Isaiah 49 verse 14 but Zion said the Lord hath forsaken me and my Lord has forgotten me can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yay they may forget yet I will not forget them they may forget yet I will not forget thee behold I have graven the upon the palms of my hand the walls are continually before me amen you know I was graven in the palm of his hand too and the Romans put a nail through it that's okay my name is still there hey man my name is still there your name still there zekiel eighteen therefore I will judge the old house of Israel everyone according to his way to set the Lord repent and turn yourself from all your transgressions so iniquity shall not be your ruin cast away from you all your transgressions whereby you have transgressed it looks like he's trying to what bring Israel by companies and make you a new heart and a new spirit for thou they will for why will ye die o house of Israel for I have no pleasure in the death of him that died saith the Lord God wherefore turn yourself and live Ezekiel 36 therefore saying to the house of Israel thus saith the Lord God now this is the Lord speaking I do not this for your sake o house of Israel but for mine holy namesake which you have profaned among the heathen whether you win and I will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathen which you have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord saith the Lord God when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes for I will take you from among the heathen and gather you remember he dispersed them remember he dispersed Israel he dispersed them several times actually and but he's but what what happened in the 40s there 49 50 where brother Branham saw the the movie where they come in on the wings of an eagle well from that time till now that what they keep coming back because the land is theirs for I shall be thanks finding you for that for I will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all the countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness them from you all your idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you in a new spirit will i put within you now this is this is us but these talking to Israel they're gonna receive the holy go listen let's just be real real clear these people that get white robes they get some kind of cleaning God's not gonna put his spirit in something that's not right he's got to make them right even the fifth seal Jews that that white robe what is our white robe somebody say what is our white robe the baptism of the Holy Ghost so if white robes were given unto them it's just that we get it on this side it's called salvation there's this called grace a new heart will I give you a new spirit what I put in you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you said dwell in the land see their promised land Abraham wherever the soles of your feet walk that is your property that's your land and you should dwell in the land that I give to your father's why do you think the Millennium the Millennium is not going to be in Luther Georgia the Millennium is going to be in Israel in Jerusalem because that's their land I still think it's just an absolute apex of a revelation for a prophet to walk up to a platform one day and say Abraham when he took communion with Melchizedek out there on the plains of Mamre he said he was looking for a city that whose builder and maker was God he said that city will rise from the same spot that Abraham took communion with Melchizedek sister Jeanne he was looking for a city and he was standing can we be the same way we're looking for something we're already standing on it can we are we doing this are we doing that because you know what if you would have told Abraham at that time Abraham you're standing on the city he'd go what are you talking about but now he just might know where that cities that being in that dimension where he's at he might be going man I'm standing on top of that thing all the time that's the city he was looking for he went looking for a city brick mortar knowest not what he was looking for that what brother Brown said that pyramid-shaped mountains gonna push right up out of the ground Oh hallelujah thank God for a prophet that could do that and you should dwell in the land that I give to your fathers and you shall be my people and I will be your God I will also save you from all your and cleanness now God's telling them this and I will call for the corn and will increase and lay no famine upon you looks like he's doing something for them huh right Jeremiah 31 32 says behold the days come saith the Lord that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers back over here in the days that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt I broke that covenant they broke that one God don't deal with broke covenants hey man we'll see that in just a minute nor the coordinates coming they're made with the followers in the day that I took them as lavalla hand and brought him out of the land of Egypt which my covenant they break although I was a husband unto them saith the Lord now we should never have to cover this again God was mad Joel was married to Israel at one time okay and he had to give her a writing of divorcement to get me and you right but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord look look at me after those days after those 2000 years I got put the Gentiles in here I will put my law in your inward part and I will write it in your heart and I will be their God and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord for they shall all know me from the least and to the greatest of them saith the Lord for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more man it looked bad at one time didn't it and brother Elias written in the word they didn't look bad but it's also written in the word that you look bad right we can say due particular but what did he do he wiped all that out he wiped all of it clean through what justification sanctification the baptism of Holy Ghost he wiped you clean if you're not cleaned today you don't have the new birth one spot one speck one black speck in your soul you don't have any birth a man neither do they neither and they're not they're not gonna be given eternal life but he said I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more Jeremiah 50 verse 19 I like what brother Ray says that's what he said cuz you know what God is gonna back his word up if he said it that's what he's going to do it's not like me and you say something then three days later we're gonna Nile better not do that no God didn't do that I will bring Israel again to his habitation and he shall feed on caramel and Bashan and his soul shall be satisfied upon the mount ephraim and Gilead in those days and then that time saith the lord the iniquity of Israel shall be salt far and there shall be none look bad for a while brulee but not right now it shall be sought for but it won't be found and the sins of Judah and they shall not be found for I will pardon them whom I reserved amen now let's cover this real quick right here then all right we got you know brother Dale can preach for an hour and a half and he slide it in you got like boy late' he didn't preach 30 minutes and I go about an hour and 10 minutes and everybody's going I think it has to do a lot with wisdom and what he does he runs it right under there and he hour and a half and you everybody's going oh that was good just saying just saying we all right amen got to have a little fun all right look we got to cover the captivity though because they went into captivity but I want you to see it remember I told you last Sunday that it all tied with Daniel 70 weeks and brother Brown said we had to get Daniel 70 weeks out of the way so we could get into the seals I didn't say that he did and that fifth seal is a total example of this because you got you got to know where to place them you got to know where to place I was telling them in Sunday school this morning you got there the Jews have several places there's a bosom of Abraham Old Testament back here from Calvary back right there's a bosom of Abraham that the Jews were in right people we're puttin in reserve until the blood was shed then you've got Jews that are bright there is Jews that are bribed because the first 120 in the upper room were pretty much Jews right so you've got Jews that are bribed you've got a fifth seal Jew that's going to be giving eternal life then you've got when we leave you got 144,000 Jews you got a deal with then over here at the white throne judgment that you could be given eternal life for being good to the bride so a man they're all you can't do away with the Jew just like God said he said how can a suckling woman forget her child she birthed the kids she ought to know where is that and when she had it right so now let's look at the captivity can we do this just for about another hour man y'all lonesome y'all might steal our chocolate Germans honky gate absolutely if you don't know what I say when I say Germans talking Kate people get excited about Germans or Kate so if I say German chocolate cake maybe I shot you for a minute all right now look let's look at this just for men is that okay because we we got to cover this and that way I want and I'll be speaking Wednesday night too so I want to cover something else moreover now this is Jeremiah now remember what Daniel did look at me for me Daniel when he was talking about the captivity because remember when Daniel wrote The Book of Daniel they were in captivity and they were getting ready to go out of captivity he said I looked at books read Daniel 9 he said our rif in other words in other words he did exactly what brother Branham said a prophet did what does the prophet do looks back to the previous profit so Daniel sitting here looking back at Jeremiah and he's actually in the prophecy of Jeremiah so he knows by books that in two years he's going out and Lord what are we gonna do when we get out because look the Daniel 70 weeks 70 weeks that are we're talked about here it's already past they were in captivity seventy years right right so that's already gone but it's an allegory of what's happening now because remember seventy weeks are determined and it goes all the way to the consummation that okay all right we've been through Daniels ten weeks a lot here so you ought to know where we're going with this moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the sound of the Millstone and the light of the candle and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years all right and it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplished then I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation says the Lord for their iniquity in the land of the Chaldeans and we'll make it a perpetual desolation remember that because that has an allegory there that has an a parable and underlying meaning because remember if we're going to talk about 70 weeks of Daniel then at the end of the 70 weeks of Daniel there's got to be some kind of destruction of nations right what we'll cover okay that all right we'll cover and it shall come to pass when seventy years to accomplish so this is Jeremiah given the prophecy now let's go to jeremiah 29:10 for thus saith the lord that after seventy years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word towards you in causing you to return to this place coming right back to what where they started okay for I know the thoughts that I towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil whoa now it wasn't peace a minute ago right he was pretty ill at this horsewoman that he's talking about but he's going to restore a bite now he can't restore back his bride because she's been polluted but he can bring her back as a servant he can bring her back under all these things the fifth seal Jew all that's covered under that then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart and I will be found of you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all nations does that sound familiar gather you from all nations whether I have driven you he's one who drove him out he's the one that dispersed them right and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive then all right say ma'am all right now let's read Daniel 9 and let's look at something here for a minute and he informed me and talked with me and said Oh Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding at the beginning of thy supplication the commandment came forth and I can am come to show thee now this is Gabriel talking to Daniel that all right Gabriel is there the angel talking to Daniel for thou art greatly beloved and therefore understand the matter and consider the vision seventy weeks are determined upon thy people who is Daniels people Jews and what is the holy city Jerusalem to do six things they got that to do six things now remember we may do this later but right now we won't because remember six things finish the white transgression make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity bring in everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy now brother Brown covered that is the six fold purpose so whatever brother Daniel whatever restores Israel back to its rightful place then six seals finishes our Redemption because the seventh seal is the seal okay but six seals finishes Redemption six fold purpose finishes the Jews Redemption the six fold purpose in our in our seals finishes the Gentile dispensation amen that all right so we can parallel them later on but what he's got to do is is we got to go through this and look finish the transgression make an end of sin and make reconciliation for iniquity bringing everlasting rights to this seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy now listen before we get started none of Daniels 70 week time element is in the Gentile dispensation because let me show you something gracious because seventy weeks are determined so here we're going to start right here here's the captivity there seventy weeks and then that's the end of it now if there had been no Gentile dispensation that's the way Daniel seventy weeks looks continued all the way through they would have accepted him at Calvary and they would have took a rapture till they're promised to be restored right but there had to be a wild olive branch graft it in that come out and broke up the seventy weeks of Daniel if you look on the chart brother branham drew that's exactly the way it looks amen know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem in other words during as Renier my Cyrus this time they're coming back they didn't build the city over in Cyrus's Kingdom no he sent them back to Jerusalem right to restore and build Jerusalem until the Messiah the prince now who's the Messiah that's Jesus Christ right here we're gonna put this cross here because that's that's his time right the Messiah when he died at Calvary okay until the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks and what's three scoring two well sixty-two yeah that's 62 everybody got that same am clears mud or clears crystal clear as crystal all right look it's just so simple everybody and I'm gonna make a statement here if brother Branham makes a quote contrary to the Bible he's not a prophet right Bibles right first so what he says has got to fit the Bible I believe that - I don't believe brother Branham made a statement and wanted the Bible to fit that cuz here's where you going to get this big controversy over whether they're seven years left or whether there's three and a half years left the Bible says they're seven I don't have another quote from a prophet I don't need a quote from the Prophet I got the Bible the street shall be built in the walls evil in trouble it's time so during this time right here now watch 62 plus 7 69 69 69 weeks from what the building to the Messiah and after 62 weeks just right in this little gap right in here the Messiah be cut off what was he cut off he was cut off from among the Jews he was killed mm-hmm my side shall be cut off but not for himself he didn't die for herself he died for us in the Jews amen he died for all but he knew who would come and who would know shake yourself just for a few minutes won't be long now watch and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city in the sanctuary who was that Titus the general in AD 70 from from ad 30 to AD 70 remember Daniel 9:24 since when you see the abomination coming get out of the city brother Brian said they wasn't a Christian in that city but the Jews that got left in that city eat their own kids because they didn't listen to what God said because word he cut him off when they said let his blood be on us and our children right here right at Calvary God stopped dealing with the nation of Israel I said the nation of Israel right the print shall come and destroy the city in the end of therefore she'll be with the flood remember the blood run out the streets right that's kind of awful that much blood when they opened up the gates that they killed so many people inside that city to the blood run out and until the end of the war desolations are determined in the end of the war alright so right here this is all what this is all the seven Church ages got it this is Gentile hey man sixty-nine weeks has already been according to the Bible not 67 and a half because that's why people in the message preached it that's wrong it's this way and he shall confirm the covenant this is where it is right here and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week who's that he because from there no no that he's the Antichrist because look he shall make a cover man for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease in other words he breaks the covenant God never breaks the Covenant this he is the Antichrist now let me ask you a question are we here when that covenants made are we here when that covenants made no we are not here brother Branham yeah better not be that's what brother Graham said we better not be here well so when is the covenant made when we go in the rapture right here hey alright with that then right here he shall make a one how many a half nope one week which is seven years there's one week left after the rapture or seven years I don't care what nobody says I do not care because the Bible's telling me he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week who is he making the covenant with the Jews right here for one week after the rapture and in the midst of the week what's the middle of seven three and a half he's gonna break it cause the sacrifice and oblation deceased for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation and that determined shall be poured out upon the desolate so there's one week left after the rapture according the Bible I just read it to you right now now hold on a minute now the Jews now the Jews are gonna get a three and a half year message 1260 day message from two prophets and what's that going to do that's gonna save the hundred and forty-four thousand amen Bojo roll that back up down up whichever one go toward that way keep driving there you go seventy weeks are determined upon by people and the holy city right the people and the city if I got that say man it split it now let me ask you a question to finish the transgression make an end of sin may reconciliation for iniquity stop right there that's the redemption of Israel the people right come on people that's that's when they get saved that's 144,000 right here so the first three one two three happens right here cuz look they go in a rapture after they're killed 144,000 now how in the world in the name of the good Lord are you going to bring in everlasting righteousness we're gonna get four five and six all jumbled into let three-and-a-half years it don't bring in everlasting righteousness that's in the Millennium seal up the vision and prophecy that's not though I don't the most-holy nope there's a three and a half year message 1260 days when they accept it their iniquity is finished I just read you the scripture their iniquity is over with their captivity is over with they receive a new heart and they go in the rapture now they're still three-and-a-half years left to finish the seventy weeks of Daniel not to finish Jesus's ministry because he preached three-and-a-half years right here and he preached three and a half years right here pretty simple bringing everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy in our North the most holy this else yours in what the Millennium brother Branham says that knowing the most holy is us coming back to the millennium and walking into the temple now cannot happen around here cannot happen right there see how man's ideas you take a profit brother Brown says oh no it's the the last high for the three and well that is the last height for the Ministry of Jesus Christ that's the first half of his ministry that's the last half brother Branham breaks all of 70 weeks down into seven years three and a half years he preached here three and a half years he's going to preach through two prophets and there's your Daniel seventy weeks the whole thing they're gonna prophesy the last half of that Messiah week they're gonna prophesy but that's not the last half of Daniel seventy weeks that's where the problem people get because you got to take the Bible first the Bible says and he shall make a covenant with many for one week in one week equals what seven years you can't change the Bible brother Branham didn't change the Bible they just totally misunderstood what he was talking about hey man yeah okay I'm gonna read you one more can I read you one more just for a minute cuz I want to tell you what happens here everybody Romans 11 I don't think they have this but if you pull out Romans 11 this is so beautiful how Paul brings this thing in and shows in Romans 11 and I don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings but I'm telling you that's Bible truth right there that's not that's not the idea of a man except that man and he's always right he wrote the Bible I didn't so 70 weeks are determined if we can just read the Bible the Bible will give us our answer can you pull that up brother Roman 11th Romans 11 one I say then hath God cast away his people now look watch me has God cast away his people god forbid can't forget her god forbid for I also AM an Israelite Paul puts his hips right in the middle of it all I man is right seed of Abraham tribe of Benjamin God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew what you not what the scripture saith of a life how he maketh intercession to God against Israel say Lord they've killed all that prophets and digged down thine altars and I am left alone how many of you felt that way while you as you move I'm the only one going through this problem but God said shut up shut up he answered and shut him up I have reserved to myself Elisha 7,000 men that are just like you that have not bowed the knee to the image of bale now watch even so at this present time also there's a remnant according to the election of grace now look right here let's take this and let's take this there's an imminent according to the election of grace but you and I are the bride alright now watch and if by grace it is no more works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then it is no more grace otherwise works is no more work what then Israel have not obtained that which he seeketh for right here they didn't obtain it he was married to him he wanted them to take all these promises he wanted them to be his chosen but they turned him down they cut him off amen and he had to put them away to get a Gentile bride that all right but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded here we get to this fifth seal the fifth seal is a blinded group of people guard literally put his hand over their eyes so he therefore being a just God he had to give them eternal life because he's the one that blinded them see now if you willfully blind yourself that's your problem point that finger like this but if God willfully blinds you he's got a place for you not for you but for the fish sealed you all right look the rest were blinded the coordinators written God have given them the spirit of slumber that's what he gave them spirit of slumber that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto I say not just that day Paul I say this day what we're at right now because they haven't accepted the Messiah they haven't accepted Christ yet they can't will we leave and David says let their tables be made of snare in a trap and a stumbling block and a recompense them to them let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back alway I say that have they stumbled that they should fall god forbid god forbid god forbid but rather through their fall all I don't to make you run through their fall salvation come to you through their fall right here you get to be the bride of Jesus Christ salvation is coming to the Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy now if the fault list is list now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles how much more their fullness for I speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am the apostle of the Gentiles I magnify my office if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh who was him Jews and might save some of them Paul saying I'm not kicking the Jews out even though there's a door open and I'm a Gentile profit I'm not shutting the door back I'm gonna bring some of my people in amen for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead because he knew that all that dead tradition they were dead if they stayed there for if the first-fruit be holy the lump is holy you were just now called a lump by God I mean by Paul well God through Paul because look who's the first fruit Israel Israel is the first fruit people you're the lump I'm just telling you what God said and if the root be holy sore the branches now here's my whole point that I was making this morning in son school it's kind of odd we preach this and then we had this in Sunday school this morning cuz we're going through the book of Romans and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree now what happened right here this is a pitiful example of a tree but this is the olive tree and this is Israel right now some of the branches got broke off and God came and grafted in a Gentile Brides that's what that whole when I made that mark in that mark this is the engrafting of the Gentile but you can't kick away this because where's the life the life's in the roots the life is holy the life goes up here now God put in a Gentile branch and it grew off of that life so if the first fruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy store the branch listen God didn't grasp the Gentile Church in a dead tree it was live now if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree work grafted in among them and with them partakers of the root and fatness of the olive tree boast not against the branches but if thou boast bearish not I mean barest thou bear'st not the root but the root thee in other words Gentiles didn't say well we ain't gotta do we can't no this is our root our whole religions built on what happened the Old Testament can't do away with it we actually have to feed off of that same tree so we can't go we're good they're bad no they got it first they're the first fruit we just was called a lump they'll wilt say then the branches were broken off that I might be grafted in hmm well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not high-minded but fear for if God spared not the natural branch take heed lest he also spare not thee in other words it says in the church ages remember it says if you keep going the way you're going I'm gonna take your candlestick out a little I'm taking your lamp out and I'm turning your light off right so let's don't boast that we're so much better than Israel we're so much better than a juice look this whole thing is working together it's a that see look that's the whole plan of redemption for Jews Gentiles 144,000 v cells you and then even over here to watch on judgment where the 104 I mean we're the please we're the first virgin how can I know why I never think of foolish virgins we're the foolish virgin will be given eternal life that's the full plan of redemption for if God spared not the natural branch I'm sorry I'm taking long took heed lest he also spare not thee behold therefore the goodness and severity of God on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness in other words he severed that word means sever he severed them from God which is the Jews but toward thee goodness if thou continue if they'll continue in his goodness otherwise thou shalt I'll also shall be cut off and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed it in for god is able to graff what ho he's able to what graft them in again graft them back for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree that's what happened to us how much more shall those which be of the natural branches shall be grafted back in hold on a minute let's include these people probably not brethren this should be inert of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come which is right here then he's gonna graph back in that good tree and so all Israel shall be safe now not every person but all predestinated Israel as it is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins well we go into the Millennium we're not gonna go a bunch of Jews you don't turn Jesus down no you better be happy you made it you better be happy you made it hey man but you know what great what a great time we'll have when we can set in this millennium and this fifth seal Jew can come into this millennium and you can say come here let me let me tell you about how you got here let me tell you about what went on there was a man named Jesus came you missed him but you didn't miss him because of you you missed him because of me and now I want to tell you about the goodness of how God saved my soul I want to tell you how I got my white robe and I was in the 21st century and I was in that Laodicean Church age I was in the darkest age that ever was and I made it let me tell you about it I got a thousand years if you want to listen we're gonna take all them fifth seal Jew and we're gonna talk to them about this plan of redemption that they didn't get they don't get a plant there into the plan of redemption but they weren't told on this side like you're being told amen we're being told the plan of redemption or exactly step by step by step by step the plan of redemption that fifth seal Jew is standing in that dimension going we're Jews we're juice and you better put a period there because that's about all the guy we're Jews we got here because they killed us because we were Jews Lord bless you you and I are the only people in the face this earth that knows how it's gonna start or how it started and we know how it's gonna end and we thank God we had a prophet they put all this together for us but you are the recipients of that you need to feed off of that you're the recipient there's no one else in the world in imput more important than me to God at this moment you can do that finger thing if you want to but I'm telling you he put me in this age for some purpose he put you in this age for some purpose you have ears and you can hear you have eyes and you can see because the last church age says bye of me I have to take away you'll blindness and that's what it is today let's stand our feet I am sorry that I took that long but that's the whole plan folks we've got it when that fifth seal open see that see and there we are the fifth seal the sealed that sealed all that up right there was the fifth seal Zhu is given eternal life because there jus but when that seal was tore off it was a lot in there as a lot in there see brother Daniel that's the thunder the thunders not the seal remember we read that that's - so totally separate things brother Brown said two separate things that steals one thing when that seal come off now we can put every bit of this together and that is the Thunder that's the voice of God when the seal broke the voice of God told me this right here the voice of God told you that the voice of God told William Branham laughs amen so let's just bask under the light of of the age we're living in we're living in an age that nobody nobody's ever lived like this before sure it's an evil ages the dark age it's the worst age that ever was but he put the best in the worst he put the best people in the worst age hey man let's bow our heads anybody has the need just raise your hand we won't we won't sing a song we'll just go in dismiss but if you got a need we need to pray for the ones that are not here brother Terrence and some of them would need to pray earnestly for them but if you got to need just lift your hand up pray right in your seat that's the way we believe it we believe that God will heal you without being touched you don't need to be touched by nobody but the Great Physician the only father we pray Lord that today what we've said would be pleasing to You Father and as we always say Lord give your people something though we be tired weary worn Satan comes in and like a roaring lion seeking to destroy Lord we know your word is always true your word is that type O your word is what we look to regardless as the Prophet said sunny days doesn't mean gods for you but cloudy days doesn't mean he's against you that's just part of nature in this first 3-dimension father we must look to your word as the Jews look to your word and said we are Jews we have a promise of God Lord we were Gentiles we didn't have anything we just had one thing and that was faith that you died on a cross faith that you sent your word and healed us faith that you sent your word through a little prophet in the end time to put these things together faith that we're standing here today because you saw us here you predestinated by your foreknowledge that a group of people would have enough revelation to stand one day and not just say old death where is your sting but o death you're destroyed we'll take a body change and we'll leave this place and then the last one week of that Daniel seventy weeks to get them back will be fulfilled after we get out of here father just forgive us of our sin sorry we took so long we have to just be with each one this is holiday season people be on the highways traveling we will be with friends and family Lord may we have just continued fellowship around you they would come back here Lord on Wednesday night and then pray for brother Chris and theirs wife making the journey out here next weekend Lord and us have a wonderful time there's a new year here it is 2018 going into 2019 we know 2019 is going to be a special year for all of us and I pray Lord that you'd be with us during that watch nut service q brother Chris Lord strong words to give us Lord meat so that we can eat and then then you will hear one day that Eagle scream and Mama Eagle come and take us home father just give us this day our daily bread and Jesus name we pray amen you know let me say one more thing you know we we talk about seventy weeks of Daniel and 70 weeks is seven years so seventy times seven so I 490 right it was it Peter said Jesus how do I forgive my fellow man seven times what do you say what do you say what'd he say you know what he's telling them it's gonna take 490 years to get forgiven he was talking to the Jews he said you gonna be you're gonna be and see they weren't when you say captivity they were in physical captivity during that 70 year time but they've been the under bondage for all this whole they're even under bondage now you know while they're under bondage they don't have a messiah there listen they every year a priestess before every year they take a cup called the cup of Elijah and they walk in and they have their say tour they sit down and they eat matzah and all that other stuff but they put that cup right here because the Jim knows Elijah has got to come back before Jesus can return they know that you know why because Malachi 4 they take Malachi 4 as their Malachi coming because before the great great and dreadful day of the Lord they miss that that's our Elijah but they're Elijah they've set a cup there they opened the door when they get finished and they look down the street this way they look down the street this way and if they don't see Elijah walking down the street you see how literal they know Elijah's got to come back if they don't see a man walking up they step back in they grab that cup and they put it on the mantle and they say until next year and then they go about their duties but they know that's why that Moses and Elijah has got to be the ones going to the Jews they know that when they say that Elijah ministry come out they're gonna go no man the Messiah is coming but I'm gonna read it next Wednesday night remember in Zechariah our Zephaniah or Zechariah he says where did you get those scars this 140 this two witnesses are going to tell this 144,000 he's not coming he came back here and you missed him and they're gonna what they're gonna go into their house shut the door and they're gonna weep for days knowing that they missed the coming of Christ but them to witness they're gonna say don't fear he's here now to that same Jesus who you crucified is fixing menhir so alive he's gonna go into your heart and he's gonna we're gonna take a rapture so God's not gonna forget him he's gonna save them when they said let his blood be us own us and our children sure that cut them off literally from getting anything in the church ages but God's gonna take that thing right there and pull it right back together and he's gonna give the Jews the baptism of the Holy go 144,000 them god bless you on your way home drive safe love you with the love of the Lord you're dismissed
