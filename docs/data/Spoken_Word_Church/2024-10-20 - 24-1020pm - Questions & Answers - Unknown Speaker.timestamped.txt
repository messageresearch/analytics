[0:00] [Music]
[0:33] hey man let's all stand our
[0:35] feet
[0:40] um thank you all for coming I didn't
[0:42] figure this many people be
[0:44] back we got two extra
[0:48] questions so try to answer them
[0:51] too all right let's go to the Lord in
[0:55] prayer um I tell you what brother Boyd
[0:56] how about open a word prayer for the for
[1:00] the
[1:01] service thank you
[1:04] Lord yes
[1:08] Lord yes
[1:23] Lord yes
[1:28] Lord that's right
[1:33] amen you can be seated we'll get right
[1:36] in to the U to the questions um they'll
[1:41] pull them up on the board like I said
[1:43] I've had a couple of these before and I
[1:46] wanted to get the this one right here is
[1:48] a really good one you know sometimes is
[1:51] U and if you ever if you want me to stop
[1:53] ask question it's totally informal okay
[1:57] and um but I hope you didn't bring you
[2:00] popcorn and your drink like we usually
[2:01] do downstairs or or your knitting
[2:06] needle but we always make this statement
[2:09] and we make statements as a as a church
[2:11] and as a a Ministry I say the the
[2:14] message we make statements like that she
[2:17] is him she is him and we shout and we
[2:19] praise the Lord and we but do we really
[2:22] understand what ises brother Ram
[2:25] mean when he says she's
[2:28] him so we're going to cover that one and
[2:31] then there's a few other ones I think I
[2:33] have four on here and then I have two
[2:35] here so oh I think I have five um but
[2:39] we're going to start with this one
[2:40] because it was the first one uh the
[2:43] oldest one but what does brother randam
[2:45] mean when he said she is him all right
[2:49] well now we know one thing for sure get
[2:51] it out of your mind we are not God
[2:54] himself right cuz that's who the HM is
[2:57] the H is Jesus Christ right we cannot
[3:00] ever be Jesus Christ we're mes Jesus
[3:03] Christ but now remember as we'll go
[3:06] through here in a minute as Adam and Eve
[3:08] were literally in one
[3:10] body all right they were literally in
[3:12] one body now us sitting here as husband
[3:15] and wife we we've never been in come out
[3:18] of the same body but Adam and Eve did
[3:22] come out of the same substance same body
[3:25] so in tight we can go back and get into
[3:28] the side of our Adam spirit
[3:30] Adam and we can get in there and become
[3:33] one with him but we'll never be The
[3:36] Headstone we're headstone people so I
[3:40] want you to understand when brother BR
[3:41] says she is him now if you take that
[3:43] literally then you would think well she
[3:45] is just exact no she is him in potential
[3:49] she is him in
[3:51] attribute she acts like him but he's
[3:54] always the head listen we've got one
[3:56] headship and that's Christ amen he was
[3:58] eternal before we were I'm sorry I know
[4:01] we were in the mind of God and all that
[4:02] but I'm talking about sitting here
[4:04] today he was eternal he would never had
[4:07] a bad thought never never anything
[4:09] entered his mind he knew what was going
[4:10] to happen he knew from his very mind
[4:13] what was going to take place and he knew
[4:15] then he would give us an opportunity to
[4:17] come back to where because
[4:20] remember we're going to read this in a
[4:22] minute when you go back across the
[4:25] chasm back into the Garden of Eden she
[4:28] is him
[4:30] right all right she is
[4:32] him same DNA and everything their bodies
[4:35] were exactly the same you know what I
[4:37] mean man and woman but they were of the
[4:39] same Source all right but when sin
[4:43] happened and it separated that we can
[4:45] never because I'll read it to you in a
[4:47] minute
[4:48] remember in the Garden of Eden before
[4:51] the fall they were
[4:53] coal she is
[4:56] him right but now after the fall God
[4:58] said no for now on you got to have a
[5:01] head you've got to be the woman woman's
[5:05] got to have headship just like Christ is
[5:07] our head so don't get it in your mind
[5:09] that we're going to totally morph
[5:12] into
[5:15] him all right because we can't ever be
[5:19] that Eternal person that never
[5:21] sinned listen we got that inside of us
[5:24] that's what we're working toward right
[5:26] but in your state of what you're in
[5:28] right now in the state of we're that
[5:30] we're in when brother M said she is him
[5:32] we'll read some of the things that he
[5:35] said to help us with that all right so
[5:38] the question is what does he mean when
[5:40] he says she is him all right we know
[5:43] we're going back to the Garden of Eden
[5:45] but when that when the fall happened God
[5:48] in Genesis 3:15 he said I'm going to put
[5:50] enmity there's going to be a division
[5:53] between me and you now and as Adam will
[5:57] now be your head Eve I I'm going to be
[6:00] the head of Adam or the head of the
[6:02] church or the head of the bride all
[6:05] right and I want you to understand that
[6:08] as close as we get to him because we are
[6:10] going to be the son of man in the end
[6:13] time but not as one person every person
[6:16] in here's got a piece of that in their
[6:19] being called Soul called The Genesis 126
[6:23] man all right is everybody with me so we
[6:26] can't be literally him because of the
[6:28] sin curse because of the Fall because of
[6:31] that and I was thinking the other day
[6:34] this sin curse is so bad that what's
[6:37] inside of you by the new birth is as
[6:39] Eternal as God is never had a beginning
[6:41] never had an end and will never die
[6:44] right but if you're flesh
[6:47] dies it
[6:49] dies that thing pulls apart and goes
[6:51] somewhere else that's how that's how bad
[6:54] Sin was in the garden that's how bad
[6:57] that thing was it wasn't just you know
[7:00] Adam had or Eve had a relationship with
[7:02] the Beast and no it was a lot more than
[7:04] that it totally separated us from coming
[7:07] the way we should have come right it
[7:09] totally separated us from God you hear
[7:13] me so bad till God can't even see us now
[7:17] brother Brown said he only sees the
[7:18] bumper blood and he hears your voice up
[7:20] through it amen because this thing is
[7:25] judged as we were talking this morning
[7:27] we're going to look at it a little bit
[7:28] more on because talking about the the
[7:30] two judgments if you're in Christ you're
[7:32] already judged in your
[7:35] soul this is
[7:38] not because remember there's two
[7:39] judgments I'm getting ahead of myself
[7:41] there's another judgment we got to go to
[7:43] to do the to to to have the Deeds Done
[7:46] in your body whether good or bad now
[7:48] your soul can never be bad if it's born
[7:51] again right so that's where you have you
[7:53] two judgments and Paul's real clear on
[7:55] that we'll cover that a little bit later
[7:56] on but don't get in your mind that we
[7:58] are exactly sure we're the same Source
[8:02] same substance brother Ram tells us that
[8:04] over and over and over again but just
[8:06] remember don't walk around and say I'm
[8:08] God now we can say that if you know what
[8:11] you're talking about it takes maturity
[8:13] to know this right here he didn't say
[8:15] this in
[8:17] 1957 he said this in 60 something rising
[8:20] of the sun I believe it is 64 65 he had
[8:24] to come to a place to where he knew what
[8:25] he was talking about but then maybe it
[8:27] trips us up to think that we're going to
[8:30] be we are the greatest thing that ever
[8:32] hit the face of this earth besides Jesus
[8:34] Christ we are you're sitting here today
[8:36] with something that no one else has in
[8:38] the world but I don't want you to sit
[8:40] there and go well I've got it all and
[8:43] they they're all dying and going to hell
[8:44] no we're going to talk about judgment in
[8:46] a little while too all right but let's
[8:48] read this right here real quick and get
[8:52] through I always say we're going to have
[8:55] plenty of time but we may not now here's
[8:57] brother Bram the rising of the sun this
[8:59] is is the quote as he being the groom
[9:02] the bride has to come forth CU it's a
[9:05] part of him now remember the bride the
[9:07] bride that God's looking at is the
[9:09] Eternal part of him everybody with
[9:12] me God's going to Rapture a bride that
[9:17] is changed resurrected changed and In
[9:21] His Image all right that be with me
[9:24] right but he still the bridegroom where
[9:27] the bride but we got to make oursel
[9:30] ready so that we can meet him and be
[9:33] able to what have his potentials and do
[9:35] all the things that that brother R tells
[9:37] us because what happens now in the world
[9:40] if you tell somebody you're the bride of
[9:41] Christ they're going to look at you
[9:45] crosseyed cuz they're all we can't do it
[9:47] we ain't we're none of us perfect you've
[9:49] heard it come
[9:50] on well you think you're perfect cuz you
[9:52] go to church and you no I ain't perfect
[9:54] cuz I go to church I'm perfect cuz I
[9:57] accepted something that was perfect
[9:59] right
[9:59] right I accept I didn't come here with
[10:01] something that perfect I accepted
[10:03] something that was perfect so I put all
[10:05] my perfection in him it all goes back to
[10:07] what the
[10:08] bridegroom but the that's why the church
[10:11] is separate the church doesn't know what
[10:13] we're talking about right sorry they
[10:15] don't the church I'm talking about the
[10:17] nominal
[10:18] church just calls you crazy but you know
[10:21] what they call Jesus crazy too right
[10:23] when he said I and my father are one now
[10:26] as being the groom the bride has to come
[10:28] forth because it's part of him it can
[10:30] only be the manifestation not the person
[10:32] the
[10:33] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[10:36] the revelations now look it's got to
[10:38] take all the revelations for you to see
[10:43] this Foundation don't see this that well
[10:46] you just have to quote
[10:48] it but we're going to become
[10:52] it it can only be the manifestation of
[10:55] the fulfilling of all the revelations
[10:58] and any others has spoke of the Bride so
[11:01] everything's got to culminate in you and
[11:03] me it can only manifest if it this some
[11:07] does something different from the groom
[11:09] it isn't the bride because she is flesh
[11:12] of his flesh bone of his bone life is of
[11:14] his life power of his power she is him
[11:18] now watch he goes back to the Garden as
[11:20] man and woman are one and women take
[11:22] woman taken from his side she had taken
[11:26] a spirit the feminist Spirit from him
[11:30] the flesh from his side made both
[11:31] mechanics and Dynamics the wife the
[11:34] spirit of him and the Flesh of him and
[11:37] put it together and made mechanics and
[11:41] Dynamics right so that's us but we're
[11:43] not
[11:45] again don't ever think that you're the
[11:49] groom you're the bride you're some we
[11:52] are submissive to
[11:56] somebody and I we're going to talk about
[11:58] judgment judgment is absolutely a part
[12:01] of a Christian
[12:02] Life you know you got scripture says
[12:04] would not be judging no one the Bible
[12:06] says we'll judge the whole
[12:09] world okay even the angels we will judge
[12:13] them but listen we got to listen to what
[12:16] God told me that's what he was going to
[12:18] do God told us in the Bible this is what
[12:20] he's going to give it to us right so if
[12:23] he does he's going to give it to us he's
[12:24] not going to want it back he's going to
[12:26] give it to us he's going to give us that
[12:27] power but we are not
[12:32] him and hold of
[12:34] one everybody with me we're a many
[12:37] membered body yes we're we're part of
[12:41] Christ but we're still submissive to a
[12:45] headship if not then we're in bad
[12:47] trouble but I believe the bride in this
[12:50] end time I just believe this we know who
[12:53] our husband
[12:55] is and then what we're going to do is is
[12:58] what we're going to do brother Anderson
[12:59] is we're going to believe what my
[13:02] bridegroom says about
[13:05] me I'm going to believe what he says
[13:07] about me now whether I manifest it it's
[13:11] my business but he said if you'll do
[13:14] these
[13:16] things right if you'll do these things
[13:19] stat your perfect man if you'll do all
[13:21] these things and like brother BR said
[13:22] get all these revelations in line he
[13:25] said I'll work through you like I worked
[13:27] through Jesus while he was on Earth now
[13:29] that I can understand I said like he
[13:32] worked through Jesus all
[13:35] right now watch in
[13:37] Matthew Jesus tells us that we're
[13:40] talking about marriage and divorce
[13:42] putting a woman away and marrying
[13:44] another and all that stuff he saith unto
[13:47] them Moses because of the hardness of
[13:48] your hearts suffered you to put away
[13:50] your wives but from the beginning it was
[13:53] not so all right so from the
[13:56] beginning and I like uh long time ago
[13:59] brother Jimmy Harris preached a preached
[14:02] a sermon on it this ain't
[14:04] so cuz he said from the beginning it was
[14:08] not so this was not supposed to
[14:12] happen this is all
[14:15] temporary everything we think we're so
[14:17] good and strong and big and got
[14:18] buildings and we got you can tell one
[14:21] thing for sure hurricane can take care
[14:22] of that much less the wrath of God which
[14:24] that's what it is but we are the Bride
[14:27] of Jesus Christ right we're the frailest
[14:31] people on in in flesh just as the world
[14:35] right that's right but we have something
[14:38] inside of us that makes us him it makes
[14:41] us act like him right CU what did he do
[14:44] he has put his DNA in US yes he's put
[14:48] his DNA and what is his DNA that big old
[14:51] long
[14:53] name what is it it's his word yes no
[14:56] more than it's his the blueprint of
[14:59] every Christian is the word of God amen
[15:01] amen and what Jesus did and his potent
[15:05] what he had inside of him is what's
[15:07] inside of you now all right so she is
[15:09] him everybody with me that's why brother
[15:12] brand he wasn't wrong when he said that
[15:14] but he had to talk to somebody of
[15:15] maturity to be able to explain and he
[15:17] didn't have time cuz he just said she's
[15:20] him she's got his
[15:22] potential she can be this she can be
[15:25] that well all he's doing is quoting the
[15:27] Bible cuz he didn't bring us anything
[15:29] else but what the Bible said the Bible
[15:32] tells you what you are spotless sinless
[15:36] virtuous he said that a long time ago
[15:40] it's just that man with their with their
[15:42] teachings out there is nothing good no
[15:45] no
[15:47] one you ain't no good and I ain't no
[15:49] good I I I
[15:51] agree but I know somebody that is that
[15:54] said I was right that's right so I'm
[15:56] going to believe him amen because
[15:59] remember if you're not bride he's not
[16:02] your
[16:04] bridegroom that's why God separated
[16:06] through a prophet he said now I call you
[16:08] bride because a bride has his potential
[16:12] this over here now remember to make this
[16:15] very soft they married to the wrong
[16:17] person
[16:20] right right I'm
[16:22] sorry you're either married to Christ or
[16:24] you're married to Satan one of the two
[16:26] right everybody with me if you married
[16:28] to Christ you have his potentials you
[16:31] are him made manifest in another form
[16:33] called a bride sitting here today right
[16:36] right and he is going to show us how to
[16:39] get back into the Garden of Eden right
[16:42] but remember we never going to get back
[16:43] in the Garden of Eden and then we look
[16:46] at just Adam standing
[16:49] there God has divided himself out that's
[16:52] what he wanted in the first place see he
[16:53] knew all this we know he knew all this
[16:56] but his whole plan was for was for this
[16:58] to be multiped lied right this was it
[17:01] multiply he said multiply when it was
[17:03] Genesis 126 multiply and replenish the
[17:06] Earth and subdue it now we haven't done
[17:09] that part yet we can't hardly subdue
[17:11] this thing right here but we will we got
[17:14] to bring it under sub subjection right
[17:17] him have the preeminence as brother R
[17:19] said the three-fold
[17:21] purpose see see that whole three
[17:24] threefold purpose does what it brings us
[17:26] back to the Garden of Eden right and
[17:27] know what he said all God was he poured
[17:29] all God what he was he poured into
[17:31] Christ all Christ was every potential
[17:34] everything he did he poured it into the
[17:36] church as a many-membered body right and
[17:39] then the third part was to take us back
[17:42] across the chasm into the Garden of Eden
[17:45] but it won't be just Adam and Eve
[17:46] standing there right it'll be a many
[17:49] membered body called The Bride of Jesus
[17:52] Christ now there'll be people foolish
[17:54] virgins will be given eternal life but
[17:55] they never were bride remember
[17:59] cup of water in my name never was bride
[18:00] now remember even Israel can't be his
[18:03] bride
[18:04] anymore right the 144,000 will receive
[18:08] the Holy Ghost but will not be bride
[18:11] right they forfeited that when they as
[18:14] as uh God told him he said I'm putting
[18:16] you away for your fornication I'm
[18:18] putting you away and I can marry you
[18:20] again I'm going to marry a gentile bride
[18:24] so that's only bride now there'll be
[18:26] Jews that'll be Bride come on
[18:28] there'll be Jews that'll be bride but
[18:30] I'm talking about the Jews of the nation
[18:32] of the 144,000 the ones that are over
[18:34] there now that's not bride they're going
[18:36] to be given eternal life they're going
[18:38] to be given the Holy Ghost right but
[18:40] they can't be bride all right they
[18:42] forfeited that the bride's gone we're
[18:45] out of here amen all right we're gone
[18:47] right so you can't have two Brides see
[18:49] he can't be married to two no all right
[18:52] just married to one so he had to divorce
[18:54] Israel to marry us and he's not going to
[18:56] remarry Israel she's going to have have
[18:58] a position she's going to have a place
[19:00] but he's not ever going to go back and
[19:02] marry her
[19:03] again all right so now look so go to
[19:05] Genesis
[19:08] 126 now she is him
[19:11] remember and God said let us make man in
[19:13] our image after our likeness and let
[19:17] them when he said them that pulled it
[19:21] apart right let them have dominion over
[19:24] the fish of sea and foul of the air
[19:26] cattle over all the Earth ever creeping
[19:29] thing that come upon the Earth so what
[19:32] God did he took a piece of
[19:34] himself set it aside for me and you now
[19:37] a peace of God is God but remember you
[19:41] got you right
[19:42] here you came on this Earth and as Bob
[19:46] said this morning God breathed that
[19:48] Breath of Life inside of you that's
[19:51] right he gave you a soul but he gave you
[19:54] a soul that was perfect he didn't give
[19:55] you a soul that was eternal right he
[19:57] gave you a soul to make a
[20:00] choice a free more agent to make a
[20:03] choice and then you ask God to breathe
[20:08] the breath of eternal
[20:10] life in you brother Dale preached many
[20:13] years ago born by the Breath of God and
[20:16] that's what it is listen you were born
[20:18] by the Breath of God to begin with you
[20:19] were given a soul but I was thinking
[20:21] about when Bob U was preaching this
[20:23] morning you know when when you were born
[20:25] as a baby and you first first first
[20:27] piece of air you sucked in your lungs
[20:30] you were
[20:34] dead you breathe death in your
[20:38] lungs I don't care how clean it was I
[20:40] don't care how beautiful the hospital
[20:42] was and all the positive air that's in
[20:45] there when
[20:46] you and started whining
[20:50] crying you started dying right exactly
[20:54] but God give us a way to reverse that
[20:57] yes sir amen because what he did was is
[20:59] the by the new birth why they call it
[21:02] new by the new birth I believe God
[21:06] literally just breathed himself into us
[21:09] when we receive the new birth how else
[21:10] you going to explain it if you received
[21:12] your first birth that way why can't you
[21:14] receive your second birth that way CU
[21:16] you're born by the Breath of God that's
[21:18] why Jesus breathed on them he didn't he
[21:20] didn't go over there and he said I'm
[21:21] going to give y'all all the Holy Ghost
[21:23] right there I'm going give you all the
[21:24] no he breathed on them and said receive
[21:26] you the Holy Ghost right so born by the
[21:29] Breath of God it's the Eternal Breath of
[21:31] God that bursts us into the body of
[21:34] Christ right now we still sucking the
[21:36] same dirty air that we we've been
[21:38] sucking all of our
[21:40] life but we got something inside of us a
[21:43] new nature yes that when we blew out
[21:46] this way when we were in the world
[21:48] things came out that shouldn't have come
[21:49] out before amen bad words bad thoughts
[21:53] bad ideas all that stuff we let it
[21:55] out but by the grace of God he cleaned
[21:58] that up and we don't have that nature
[22:00] anymore am but we're still breathing in
[22:03] this world and we're still dying and
[22:04] we're still getting older but this piece
[22:07] of God sure it is God but it's God
[22:10] dividing himself CU he wanted a family
[22:14] right and God didn't you know as we were
[22:16] growing
[22:17] up I I don't know if Ryan and Gabby said
[22:20] we're going to have four girls
[22:22] surprise but uh you know you want to
[22:25] procreate you that's what we were put
[22:27] here for to m multiply and replenish the
[22:30] Earth
[22:31] right and as they did that now they
[22:34] didn't know how many kids they going to
[22:35] have but God
[22:36] did God knew exactly how many whereever
[22:39] seed would
[22:40] fall all right I'm speaking a little off
[22:43] here but so the kids can understand it a
[22:47] little bit y'all can explain it to them
[22:49] at home but there was many seed went out
[22:52] God has planted many seed out in the
[22:54] world he's give everybody life he gave
[22:56] Adolf Hitler life right but now he
[22:59] didn't breathe the breath of eternal
[23:01] life in him to make him a new creature
[23:04] to put the SE SE Gene of God in that
[23:07] person right and let it develop I like
[23:10] what brother brandom said he said it
[23:12] starts out as a little he even
[23:13] illustrates it as a little Bey uh button
[23:16] little white
[23:17] light and then it just continues to grow
[23:21] and you and I are not we're not just
[23:22] born by the Breath of God we continue
[23:25] with the Breath of God through our
[23:26] Christian experience and if we have to
[23:28] breathe our last Last Breath of the
[23:31] Fallen condition here that doesn't make
[23:33] any difference cuz the first breath
[23:34] you're going to draw is the breath you
[23:35] should have draw had it not been a
[23:39] fall oh yeah they're breathing over
[23:41] there they're not just sitting over
[23:42] there they're human
[23:44] beings right brother R said they human
[23:46] beings they just don't have a body I
[23:47] mean a flesh
[23:49] body your theophan is who you are it
[23:52] doesn't it it doesn't
[23:54] uh that only changes your Dwelling Place
[23:58] so what's inside of you here is going to
[24:00] develop over there it's actually
[24:02] developing here it's just going to you
[24:04] can't take this with you to that other
[24:05] dimension but when they come here now
[24:08] that's another subject when they come
[24:10] here that's a whole different ball game
[24:13] when they come here there's something
[24:14] happen that's going to transform our
[24:16] body and change the very atoms that we
[24:20] have and then we will be Body Spirit and
[24:24] soul that what he saw when brother Brown
[24:27] said God took a picture you before the
[24:29] foundation of the world that's what
[24:31] we're heading
[24:32] toward but remember he's still our
[24:35] father he's still Our Savior he's still
[24:37] our healer but he'll lose some of those
[24:40] when we get across over the other
[24:41] curtain a
[24:42] time all right we don't need healing
[24:45] over there we get healing here we'll
[24:47] always know he's a savior but we won't
[24:49] need to go and bow and and ask
[24:51] forgiveness of our sins that'd be made
[24:53] somebody
[24:54] happy to go through an eternity and
[24:56] never have to say I'm sorry
[25:00] you said all that no we're going to be
[25:02] perfect we can't fathom
[25:05] that you know what I do though I put my
[25:08] confidence that he's already got it set
[25:10] up for me that's right I was thinking
[25:12] the other day been away from June for a
[25:15] week and uh we had our 45th wedding
[25:17] anniversary and I just love I love her
[25:20] and I I I love her to
[25:22] death but brother Ry said that's a drop
[25:24] in the
[25:25] bucket to what that love is that you're
[25:27] that the Cy love amen but think about
[25:30] that you love your wife and you think
[25:32] well man if I go across a curtain of
[25:34] time I'm going to lose that no brother
[25:36] Brown thank God he said you'll always
[25:38] know know she was your wife right
[25:41] there's some things we'll know some
[25:42] things we won't but but you'll think man
[25:45] I'm going to lose this love no no that
[25:48] love is temporary that love is filial
[25:51] love that love has an
[25:54] end when we get over there that agape
[25:56] love is going to be don't what I'm tell
[25:58] tell you don't worry when you get to the
[26:00] other side you'll still remember know
[26:02] that your wife's your wife but you will
[26:04] not love her like you did
[26:06] here it'll be so much higher till you we
[26:10] can't fathom it we can't we cannot
[26:12] fathom it but I just have to believe
[26:14] that God's got it for us yes yes sir you
[26:17] think'
[26:20] married do what no what you have to ask
[26:24] her probably
[26:26] not right don't have to ask her we all
[26:29] know the answer saying if it had been
[26:31] for the word if it hadn't been for if it
[26:33] hadn't been for the Providence of God
[26:35] why you put me on a spot like this if it
[26:38] wasn't for the Providence of God no we
[26:39] would not still be
[26:42] married okay probably not Jun said yeah
[26:46] we would see
[26:48] that's do what yeah yeah that's true
[26:52] that's true but we would well that's why
[26:55] people in the world just say you know
[26:59] that's what I'm saying see you
[27:01] later well like like God said he said
[27:04] what man's joined together I don't know
[27:06] about but what God has joined together
[27:09] let no man put us under so what God
[27:12] joined together will always be together
[27:14] one way or the other all right Jo
[27:17] everybody with me on that okay yes
[27:21] ma'am
[27:24] yes
[27:27] yes oh I thank you I thought of sister
[27:30] Sharon Rose brother's daughter she died
[27:32] when she was 18 months but she somehow
[27:35] knew Billy Paul was her brother and she
[27:38] asked how is my brother Billy Paul right
[27:41] we know I don't understand that but God
[27:44] there again God saw her as an
[27:46] 18-year-old girl whether she made it
[27:49] that or that there or not which
[27:51] obviously she didn't in this side but
[27:53] there's remember there's not going to be
[27:55] babies in heaven brother
[27:59] I just wanted to add to the uh comment
[28:02] on on why because there there is
[28:06] doctrines and there is people that
[28:08] believe this message supposedly that
[28:11] have come to that point to say that the
[28:13] bride is God like literally God yeah and
[28:16] so you fight that a lot in in in Central
[28:19] America and there's but um so so so what
[28:23] the way I think it because I'm just
[28:25] crazy and you all know that amen uh I'm
[28:27] I'm very crazy and and this is simp
[28:29] simple to think I guess maybe to help
[28:31] the the the little ones but a body
[28:34] without a head is a freak body right
[28:36] absolutely but then a floating head by
[28:38] itself without a body is a freak body as
[28:40] well right you'll see those in a couple
[28:43] weeks oh yes and then you see them here
[28:44] in Halloween Halloween so so Satan uses
[28:47] the freak bodies but when it's it's the
[28:49] whole body together the head and he
[28:52] wants us to stay separate that's why he
[28:54] wants us to stay separate if Satan can
[28:56] keep us separate from our head we're
[28:57] afid
[28:59] and we have no
[29:00] power a body don't have any a body can
[29:03] think of moving it hand and if there's
[29:05] not a body
[29:06] there or if a body's there and it's like
[29:09] well I want to walk if there's no head
[29:11] to tell it to walk it's not going
[29:13] anywhere and we do need Christ he is our
[29:17] head amen and and if you say she is him
[29:20] I think it maybe why this question came
[29:21] out she is him now you got you can't
[29:25] literally take that you got to have
[29:27] deser erment as we're going to talk
[29:29] about later on we going to you got to
[29:31] have discernment to discern what brother
[29:32] Brown's saying yes we are God made
[29:36] manifest in another form called a
[29:39] bride so he set a part of himself to the
[29:42] side that b with me the Genesis 126 man
[29:46] CU remember when Adam and Eve sinned
[29:48] there was nothing else coming out of
[29:49] that Genesis 126 man until he died in
[29:51] Calvary right everybody with
[29:56] me I didn't get me many amens are
[29:59] there Adam and Eve were supposed to
[30:02] produce this Genesis 126 man Christ Adam
[30:06] first Adam
[30:08] Christ Eve the
[30:10] bride every how you want to say it it
[30:12] wasn't sex cuz that's what got him out
[30:14] of the garden right but it was spoken
[30:16] word the spoken word of God then we were
[30:19] supposed to come forth right that didn't
[30:21] happen we know that well you know why it
[30:23] didn't happen cuz God saw it he brother
[30:25] B said he he the way he says things is
[30:28] just Scholars don't know nothing brother
[30:31] R said God knew when they were put in
[30:33] flesh bodies they would fall yep all
[30:37] right so he put them in there anyway
[30:39] though because that's what he wanted to
[30:40] do he wanted to have he wanted to
[30:43] fellowship with us not in spirit form in
[30:45] flesh form but the spirit inside of the
[30:47] flesh but what happened was that
[30:49] couldn't happen in the garden and that's
[30:51] why there was a CM God said I'm going to
[30:53] have to take the book back Adam you
[30:55] can't do this I'm going to come and do
[30:58] that's where the Covenant was there was
[31:00] a there was a covenant down here that
[31:01] you're
[31:02] equal but God knowing that they were
[31:05] going to fall and made the second
[31:08] Covenant and we'll read it here in just
[31:10] a little bit in Genesis where he says
[31:12] now sisters you'll have to go under your
[31:15] head and you'll bring children in
[31:19] sorrow and pain and
[31:22] anguish and it don't it and and at Birth
[31:25] it don't stop when you got kids like
[31:27] ours Sister Barbara your old
[31:31] too I thought of it for a while now as
[31:36] Jesus being of the Christ because it
[31:38] takes a head and a body to make one
[31:41] entity so together they are the
[31:45] Christ right exactly good point that's
[31:50] good sister Barbara's quiet but man she
[31:52] can come up with some
[31:53] stuff appreciate sister barbar we should
[31:56] always do appreciate her appreciate at
[31:58] her uh her attitude for the word of
[32:01] God all right so so there we go then you
[32:04] got to have a head and a body Christ
[32:07] listen Christ decided to do
[32:10] this it was his
[32:13] decision nobody remember he said I don't
[32:15] take counsel from
[32:17] nobody because his counsel first is
[32:20] perfect how you going to have how you
[32:22] going to listen to somebody else that
[32:23] was perfect he's the only perfect one so
[32:26] whatever he decided that's way it was
[32:28] going to be he looked down through time
[32:29] we know that in predestination he saw
[32:31] everything he saw all the attitudes he
[32:33] knew Adam was going to do what he did he
[32:35] knew Eve was going to do what he did
[32:38] right but remember as Adam didn't
[32:40] destroy
[32:42] Eve Christ didn't destroy us he's going
[32:45] to enhance us right because that book
[32:48] came back with Jesus on the day of
[32:50] Pentecost that scripture right there was
[32:53] in Jesus Christ wrapped up in him all
[32:56] right it it wasn't in bulls and goats it
[32:59] wasn't in Moses it wasn't in Isaiah
[33:03] hello it was in Christ this was a part
[33:06] of him that he held until he came on
[33:10] Earth and then he had to die to release
[33:12] that
[33:13] book to start releasing the names of his
[33:16] children which would be Peter
[33:19] James John all the ones in the upper
[33:22] room all right everybody with me on that
[33:25] but that's what God decided and if you
[33:26] think well I got it way to do it than
[33:28] you're God and you're the Antichrist now
[33:31] hello that's exactly what Satan wanted
[33:33] to do somebody said that this morning I
[33:36] think that's Satan's whole
[33:38] problem he wants to be God right and
[33:42] that's why you got to be careful with
[33:43] that
[33:45] Doctrine you can get to where you can
[33:47] say I'm God and I can do whatever I want
[33:49] to do right that's what they'll do they
[33:53] but see the the
[33:55] balance I can tell you today that yes we
[33:57] are God made manifest in another form
[33:59] and what we do in our
[34:02] soul what we do is God like it is him
[34:07] that's right all right but on this side
[34:09] over here we're not God to where we make
[34:12] we make decisions above the word of
[34:16] God you can't do that then what you've
[34:18] done is you've made yourself head you've
[34:21] Ed authority over the word of God and
[34:23] there is no word uh authority over the
[34:25] word of
[34:26] God so so that's where they go off on
[34:28] this side but see Satan likes that cuz
[34:30] Satan likes to go over on this side and
[34:33] say man you're right there in the word
[34:35] your Prophet said she is him just like
[34:37] the polygamy thing the the polygamy
[34:39] Doctrine come right out of marriage and
[34:40] divorce where brother R said it wasn't
[34:42] right but he said it was right at a time
[34:45] well somebody I guess figures it this is
[34:47] the time well bless them people want
[34:49] more than one
[34:55] wife so so God created man as own image
[34:59] and the image of God created him male
[35:00] and female now he he's very specific
[35:03] that he pulled them apart and made them
[35:04] male and female right so there's got to
[35:07] be a male and a female because it's got
[35:08] to be a type all the way down Adam and
[35:10] Eve Christ and the
[35:12] bride right it's got to go all the way
[35:14] down so God created man his own image
[35:17] and the image of God created him male
[35:18] and female created he them Genesis 2:7
[35:24] the Lord God formed man of the Dust of
[35:26] the ground breathed into his nostril the
[35:28] breath of life and Man became a living
[35:31] Soul right and the Lord God planted a
[35:34] garden Eastward of Eden and there he put
[35:36] a man now watch he put the man woman
[35:39] wasn't there to begin with she's inside
[35:42] of him all right so Genesis 2:20 and AD
[35:47] Adam gave names to all the cattle foul
[35:49] the air beast of the field but for Adam
[35:52] there was not found in help meat for him
[35:55] and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[35:57] fall fall upon Adam and he slept and he
[36:01] took one of his ribs and closed up the
[36:02] flesh instead thereof and the rib which
[36:05] the Lord God took from man he made a
[36:07] woman he took the substance of the man
[36:10] right flesh everybody with me a rib was
[36:14] taken from Adam that was a flesh piece
[36:15] of Adam it wasn't his
[36:18] Spirit it was a flesh piece a literal
[36:20] piece of him and God expanded those
[36:23] cells and made a body right everybody
[36:26] with me all right remember brother Brown
[36:28] said she wasn't created she was from the
[36:31] same
[36:33] Source showing a top that when we get
[36:35] back into the sight of Jesus Christ like
[36:37] we're supposed to be we're of the same
[36:40] Source all right bone of his bone flesh
[36:42] of his flesh life of his
[36:45] life and Adam and brought it to the Man
[36:48] and Adam said this is now bone of my
[36:49] bone and Flesh of My Flesh
[36:51] literally she shall be called
[36:54] woman which is a man with a womb W man
[36:57] all right
[36:58] because she was taken out of man
[37:01] therefore shall a man leave his father
[37:02] and mother and shall cleave unto his
[37:04] wife and they shall be one flesh and
[37:06] they were both naked the man and his
[37:08] wife and were not ashamed there was
[37:10] something going on there that hid
[37:12] them to the carnality they were fixing
[37:15] to head into all right is everybody with
[37:17] me CU we know what happened in the
[37:19] garden all right they walked around
[37:20] naked for centuries and pro and never
[37:22] bothered them one bit until something a
[37:24] little seed was planted not in Eve's
[37:26] physical womb but in her her womb up
[37:28] here right this is where Satan got to
[37:31] her first right here and brother Brown
[37:33] said she
[37:35] stopped brother B talking about moving
[37:37] on she
[37:44] stopped and and just to put it all in
[37:47] context that's why that you know God's
[37:51] not mad at at at at
[37:54] sisters okay God's not mad at sisters
[37:57] right uh when he said you know you can't
[37:59] preach Earth of
[38:02] authority but look what Eve did without
[38:05] an authorative
[38:09] head come on look what she did with her
[38:12] feminist feelings emotions overtook her
[38:17] and she never even considered going and
[38:19] asking
[38:19] Adam what can I do with it what's going
[38:22] on here no she was there she did it cuz
[38:25] she thought brother Ram said she thought
[38:27] she was right
[38:29] so
[38:31] therefore God said I can't
[38:33] allow
[38:35] sisters to teach and
[38:38] preach everybody with me so God's not
[38:41] mad it's the
[38:42] female but what happened in the garden
[38:45] God's got to keep that pattern all the
[38:46] way down through because now here we are
[38:48] at the very end and we have a dominating
[38:50] female
[38:51] Spirit what she ERS authority over her
[38:55] head right
[38:58] naturally and
[38:59] spiritually man I mean naturally now you
[39:03] see things is going on
[39:06] wow if they want to be a woman they can
[39:09] if they want to be a man they can they
[39:10] do whatever they want to do it's just
[39:12] like before the FL when the Bible says
[39:14] every man's thoughts the imagine of
[39:17] every man's thoughts were evil and they
[39:20] thought they were doing the right thing
[39:22] well Eve thought she was doing the right
[39:24] thing all right so the Lord God said
[39:26] unto the serpent now the this is after
[39:27] the fall because thou Hast done this
[39:29] Thou Art cursed above all cattle and
[39:32] every beast of the field and on belly
[39:33] Thou shalt go remember turn him into a
[39:36] snake now remember he didn't curse
[39:41] Adam and curse Eve and kill him and you
[39:44] know destroy him he didn't change him
[39:46] into a snake why because he still had a
[39:49] type and a purpose to use that's right
[39:52] where now there's got to be headship and
[39:54] I will put enmity between thee and the
[39:56] woman now Serpent and between thy seed
[39:59] and her seed and it shall bruise thy
[40:00] head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[40:01] remember that's the promise that Jesus
[40:03] Christ was going to come right through
[40:05] the same thing not through adultery but
[40:08] through creative act of God but still
[40:10] come through a natural womb that baby
[40:13] was born Mary had birth pains right Mary
[40:17] carried that baby and and she had that
[40:19] baby just like all y'all have a baby
[40:21] right all right but it was not of a man
[40:24] it was of God right the way it should
[40:26] have been that's why as we started into
[40:29] the beginning of the creation of God
[40:30] that's what God wanted yes to begin with
[40:33] to to produce the egg and The Germ just
[40:37] back from the Genesis 126 man place it
[40:39] in there and then have baby sorry that's
[40:41] just the way I see
[40:43] it so he put emity though and that's a
[40:46] division emity means to separate so in
[40:48] other words God said look I can't deal
[40:51] with you like I've been dealing I've got
[40:53] to kill this lamb throw it back into
[40:55] there it's going to be the blood now
[40:57] that's going to cover you you got to go
[40:59] to the altar you've got to make a
[41:01] sacrifice and now there's going to start
[41:04] what we're going to talk about in a
[41:05] little while
[41:09] judgment because Adam was judged he was
[41:12] driven out of the garden Eve was judged
[41:16] she was going to well we'll read it and
[41:19] unto the woman he said I will greatly
[41:21] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[41:24] in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth
[41:26] children now remember at this time she
[41:28] was already pregnant yeah with the two
[41:32] seeds with the with the the Beast and
[41:34] Adam she was already pregnant right
[41:36] here so those two are going to come in
[41:39] sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children
[41:42] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[41:44] and he shall rule over thee now there's
[41:46] where the Covenant changed where you got
[41:48] headship with a male
[41:51] female under submission all
[41:54] right Genesis 3:20 and and then Adam had
[41:58] to name this person cuz remember she was
[42:01] under him now she wasn't by him she was
[42:04] under him so she had to have a name that
[42:06] separated her from Adam and Adam called
[42:10] his wife's name Eve because she was the
[42:12] mother of all living unto Adam also and
[42:15] to his wife did the Lord God make coats
[42:16] of skins and clothe them and the Lord
[42:19] said behold the man has become as one of
[42:21] us to know good and evil and now lest he
[42:24] put forth his hand and take also the
[42:26] tree of life and and live forever in
[42:27] other words he had to drive them out of
[42:29] the
[42:30] garden he had to
[42:32] separate he had to separate them from
[42:35] from the Tree of Life which is what
[42:37] Jesus Christ right because Adam couldn't
[42:39] be Jesus Christ Adam couldn't be your
[42:43] savior now he typed the first Christ yes
[42:46] he did because when he took Eve he
[42:49] didn't destroy her he took her sin right
[42:52] and said Put it on me God and that's
[42:55] what God did he said okay I'm not going
[42:57] to curse you but I'm going to curse the
[42:59] ground I'm going to curse everything you
[43:01] do you're going to sweat you're going to
[43:03] work that's going to be a word that's
[43:05] still now a bad word in the
[43:07] 21st
[43:11] century let's go now to First
[43:13] Corinthians real quick we got to get
[43:14] through
[43:15] this 1 Corinthians 6 ver verse1 15 know
[43:19] you not that your bodies are the members
[43:21] of Christ all right now here we go shall
[43:23] I then take the members of Christ and
[43:25] make them the members of an Harlot God
[43:29] forbid now remember God separates that
[43:31] in the Book of Revelations there is a
[43:33] harlot church and there's a true church
[43:36] all right shall I then take the members
[43:38] of Christ and make them the members of a
[43:40] harlot God forbid Paul said what know
[43:44] you not that he which is joined to an
[43:46] Harlot is one body for two saith he
[43:49] shall be one flesh but now watch but he
[43:51] that is joined unto the Lord is one
[43:55] Spirit see that Paul he he he he comes
[43:59] down through there and sometimes you get
[44:00] lost in Paul if you don't read the whole
[44:02] thing but you said but but he that is
[44:06] joined unto the Lord is one
[44:10] Spirit by one Spirit we're baptized into
[44:13] one body that's why we all have it's got
[44:15] to be something new that's why I totally
[44:19] disagree with people to think we came
[44:21] here with something special already
[44:23] inside of
[44:24] us we had potential
[44:27] God knew what we'd need God had it right
[44:29] there with and and praise God he did put
[44:31] an angel with you when you were
[44:33] born I believe that even through all the
[44:36] bless that Angel's
[44:38] heart all the filth he had to
[44:43] watch well pray for me well don't pray
[44:46] for me it's under the blood you don't
[44:47] have to pray for that any
[44:50] more but we all God knew we'd come to a
[44:53] place how many times have you really
[44:54] thought you was going to die before you
[44:56] got saved I mean several times sister
[44:59] Rebecca got her hand up a lot of us
[45:02] we're just inches of being killed or
[45:04] within inches of ruining our life really
[45:08] right and we were saved by that angel
[45:10] but it wasn't because we had something
[45:11] in us it's because God said hey go take
[45:14] care of that kid right there because
[45:15] when he gets an adult he's
[45:17] mine Lord when he gets an when he get
[45:20] now that to me that's predestination by
[45:22] for knowledge not that there was some
[45:24] little glowing something in me as I was
[45:26] going to The Beer
[45:29] Store I pray for me know y'all ever
[45:35] went but there wasn't there was
[45:37] something
[45:38] there that shielded me from anything
[45:42] well talk about the Providence of God
[45:44] Amen talk about the Providence of God
[45:47] you not knowing one thing caring one
[45:49] thing didn't even know where God was and
[45:51] he had an
[45:53] angel right there beside you the whole
[45:55] time right amen and that angel was given
[45:57] charge just for
[45:59] you keep that kid
[46:01] safe Satan's going to try to kill him
[46:04] amen keep that kid safe cuz I know I got
[46:08] to work for him when he gets older he's
[46:10] going to come to a place he's going to
[46:12] love me and realize I loved him first
[46:16] boy don't ever forget salvation folks we
[46:18] ain't done above down that no we're not
[46:21] above salvation right amen wives submit
[46:24] yourselves to your own husbands as unto
[46:28] the Lord all right for the husband is
[46:30] the head of the wife even as Christ is
[46:33] the head of the church and he's the
[46:35] savior of that body or that church
[46:38] therefore as the church is subject unto
[46:40] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[46:43] husbands in everything now watch
[46:46] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[46:49] also loved the church and gave himself
[46:52] for it right that he might now listen
[46:57] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[46:59] with the washing of Water by the word
[47:02] right being your husband he's going to
[47:05] clean you
[47:06] up if we accept that right if we accept
[47:10] that like brother Rob was talking about
[47:11] the unclean Spirit that's why I can't
[47:14] understand where was that unclean spirit
[47:15] before he was born again it was in your
[47:16] soul right it wasn't playing around in
[47:18] your body it wasn't playing around in
[47:19] your spirit it was in your soul so how
[47:21] can there be an unclean thing and a
[47:23] clean thing in that
[47:25] house right
[47:27] God said I won't dwell in an unclean
[47:28] vessel now the Bible's real clear it
[47:30] says the unclean Spirit right had to be
[47:33] driven out so that the clean Holy Spirit
[47:35] could come in to me that's just you know
[47:38] what it's too simple for people it's
[47:41] just too simple The Simple Plan of
[47:43] Salvation I was lost I was
[47:46] dead and God came and saved
[47:49] me put his soul inside of me and then I
[47:53] was born again right amen two simple for
[47:57] some that he might sanctify and cleanse
[48:00] it with the washing of Water by the word
[48:02] now what that watch now he might that he
[48:04] might present it to
[48:06] himself you think it say present it to
[48:09] the
[48:09] father or present it to the world but
[48:13] he's going to present her to
[48:16] himself cuz she is him there's where
[48:19] brother R could get that she is him but
[48:21] now
[48:22] look that doesn't mean now watch what
[48:26] Paul says watch this in the red that he
[48:28] might present it to himself a glorious
[48:30] church not having
[48:32] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it
[48:36] should be holy and without blemish now
[48:38] that's what God said about us now watch
[48:41] the next thing he says now he's going to
[48:43] keep going he's going to drop down on
[48:44] the earth so ought men to love their
[48:47] wives as their own body now he's down
[48:50] here
[48:50] now he that loveth his wife loveth
[48:54] himself okay he that love loveth himself
[48:58] his wife loveth
[49:00] himself he's going to present it to
[49:02] himself CU he loves his wife cuz she is
[49:05] him she has the potential she has
[49:07] everything that he wants in a bride
[49:12] right for no man ever yet hated his own
[49:16] flesh oh no we didn't we've got it all
[49:18] together today
[49:21] and I hope you did for no man ever yet
[49:25] hated his own flesh but look nourish it
[49:27] and cherishes it now remember who are we
[49:30] we're the
[49:31] body so Christ is going to nourish us
[49:35] he's going to cherish
[49:36] us even as the lord of the church which
[49:39] is us now watch for we are members of
[49:42] his body all right so now God's taking
[49:44] us back into his
[49:47] body of his
[49:50] flesh and of his bone Colossians 1 ver5
[49:54] who is the image of the invisible God
[49:57] the firstborn of every creature for by
[50:00] him were all things created that are in
[50:02] heaven Earth visible and invisible
[50:05] whether they be Thrones or dominions
[50:07] principalities Powers all things were
[50:10] created by Him and for him and he is
[50:13] before all things and by him all things
[50:15] consist Paul's really laying it out
[50:17] there pretty
[50:18] thick and he is the head of the body the
[50:21] church now
[50:23] remember it took a prophet to tell us
[50:26] what that church was right
[50:29] there cuz see they can read it and say
[50:31] oh he says we the church the church
[50:33] church church church brother BR said I
[50:35] call you bride there's a separation here
[50:38] you're the true
[50:40] church but you're the
[50:42] bride right who is the beginning the
[50:45] firstborn from the dead that in all
[50:47] things he might have the preeminence for
[50:50] it pleased the father that in him now
[50:52] watch should all fullness dwell not us
[50:55] in him
[50:58] right and having made peace through the
[51:00] blood of his cross by him to
[51:05] reconcile all things unto
[51:10] himself he's reconciling his bride back
[51:12] to himself we got separated from him in
[51:16] the
[51:17] garden by him I say whether they be
[51:19] things on earth or things in heaven and
[51:21] you that were sometimes
[51:24] alienated wow we were separated from God
[51:28] yes enemies in your own mind by Wicked
[51:31] Works yet now hath he reconciled in the
[51:34] body of his flesh through death to
[51:38] present you holy unblamable
[51:42] unreprovable in his
[51:43] side he did all that for
[51:47] us now notice the quickening power we'll
[51:50] be finished with this right here I think
[51:52] in just a second I'm trying to show you
[51:54] that when you raised when when God
[51:56] raised Jesus from the dead he raised up
[52:00] you yep right everybody with me amen now
[52:05] remember that theophany that was in
[52:09] Jesus was that Genesis 126 man right
[52:13] that's right that's what Adam should
[52:14] have done over here all right he had a
[52:18] book and he couldn't produce it sin
[52:21] couldn't get us where we need to be
[52:24] right somebody born when no sin had to
[52:26] get us
[52:27] cuz that remember the Genesis 126 man
[52:29] never was born of a
[52:31] Woman by
[52:33] sex no we're born by the Breath of God
[52:37] adults or even kids can get the Holy
[52:40] Ghost but we're not babies a baby can't
[52:44] a baby can't receive the Holy Ghost
[52:45] y'all hear me anyway can't you but so
[52:47] that book was given when God raised
[52:49] Jesus from the dead he raised up you
[52:55] right but now I want you to realize
[52:57] something when Jesus was body was laying
[53:00] in the Tomb you weren't
[53:03] there exactly brother B said the word
[53:07] the word laid cold and dead in the
[53:09] grave the word
[53:11] body but this is the
[53:13] theophany where did it go it went to
[53:16] hell took you to hell with him right
[53:19] because when he raised up what did he do
[53:21] he just puts the two back
[53:23] together and then was able to not be
[53:27] caught up in this
[53:28] flesh he could Ascend and then send this
[53:32] thing back just say
[53:35] here start producing my children by
[53:38] spiritual
[53:40] birth amen born by the Breath of God
[53:44] now when God raised Jesus from the dead
[53:46] he raised up you also and also quickened
[53:49] to life with him you are now quickened
[53:52] to life although then you were but an
[53:55] attribute in in his thoughts but God had
[53:58] saw all in him at the
[54:02] Finish are we not at the Finish we're at
[54:05] to finish when God looked down upon that
[54:08] body the spirit left him in the Garden
[54:10] of Gethsemane he had to die a man that's
[54:13] where the people get the quote where
[54:14] they say that Jesus U wasn't God to the
[54:17] River Jordan and then he wasn't God when
[54:18] he's hanging on the cross if God didn't
[54:20] die for me we got to find somebody can
[54:22] that's right cuz God had to now we know
[54:25] God can't die
[54:27] but that body was God's body right I
[54:29] don't know whether you know when the
[54:31] question was a couple of couple of uh
[54:35] ministers meetings ago about Jesus's
[54:38] body being the body of God well let me
[54:41] answer me who's it
[54:44] was answer me tell me if his body didn't
[54:47] come from God then it came from a human
[54:48] man and we're in trouble that's right
[54:51] exactly right so that was God's body
[54:54] amen that's the one he UC from himself
[54:58] his own body and his own blood that was
[55:01] his own
[55:03] guts that was his own heart that was his
[55:07] own lungs and all his other body parts
[55:09] that was God that's
[55:12] right he didn't have to do it remember
[55:15] friends he didn't have to do it that was
[55:16] God God anointed that flesh which was
[55:19] human flesh we know that for a fact he
[55:21] didn't if he'd have went up there as God
[55:24] he'd never died that kind of death now
[55:25] we understand understand what happened
[55:27] the spirit left him or the anointing
[55:28] left him not the spirit the anointing
[55:30] left him so he could die all right can't
[55:33] kill God but he didn't have to do it but
[55:35] remember he went there with you and
[55:38] him all right she is
[55:43] him but remember we weren't there as
[55:46] individual people that running around
[55:47] inside of
[55:48] Jesus just like you weren't running
[55:50] around inside your daddy right everybody
[55:54] with me
[55:56] yes come on now potentially you were if
[55:59] you look back and know exactly what's
[56:01] going to happen to the exact seed that
[56:04] you were which God
[56:06] did but your mom and daddy didn't right
[56:11] you weren't even in their
[56:14] thoughts but you were in
[56:18] God's so he could take this one and this
[56:20] one put them together to put them
[56:23] together to bring your body here to
[56:26] match the attribute Esau what a mighty
[56:28] God we
[56:29] serve so yes this is all orchestrated by
[56:32] God God had his hand in everything we do
[56:35] if you're a Christian today he had his
[56:37] hand in everything you did uh the bad
[56:39] don't worry about
[56:41] that he saw you
[56:44] repent he knew you'd
[56:47] repent he knew you'd know how to repent
[56:49] and then he knew that when he run this
[56:51] message by your path you'd accept
[56:54] it cuse this message is
[56:58] him the word's him the message is him
[57:01] she is him so that way I can understand
[57:04] that but keep them separate to where we
[57:06] don't pray to
[57:09] ourself we don't pray to oursel hey God
[57:12] what do you want to do today well I
[57:13] don't know what do you want to do today
[57:15] that's silly we have a Heavenly Father
[57:18] we have a headship we have to pray we
[57:20] have to ask God right so that makes him
[57:24] our head right right so when God looked
[57:27] down upon the body of Christ he saw both
[57:29] male and female it was all redeemed now
[57:31] watch it was all redeemed in that one
[57:34] body see they are one same same word the
[57:38] same word this is where the quote comes
[57:40] from that like she is him and then he
[57:43] says this later on the same word spoke
[57:46] of the groom speaks of the Bride right
[57:49] amen now he decided that he worded this
[57:54] message the way he wanted it worded
[57:57] amen can you imagine now brother randam
[58:01] is preaching 1100 sermons is everybody
[58:03] with me he died in 1965 let's just say
[58:06] until about 1971 when the church was
[58:08] started here not just because of this
[58:10] church but let's just use it for an
[58:11] example that brother Mo started
[58:13] preaching and he would reach and grab a
[58:16] quote he'd grab a book that brother Ram
[58:19] had already
[58:21] preached this is exciting he reached and
[58:24] grabbed the book and he read a quote
[58:27] that matched the sermon he was
[58:30] preaching that's right not the whole
[58:32] message
[58:34] quote and brother Bob comes today and
[58:37] I'm reading a quote right here that God
[58:38] knew I would use so he had brother R say
[58:43] right right amen what a mighty God we
[58:46] serve right you you think of all the
[58:48] Snippets of quotes that we pulled out I
[58:50] mean like Dad used to use he used 30
[58:53] quotes from different messages so it was
[58:55] spread out way over here and God knew
[58:57] that brother R was going to have to say
[58:59] this and what a mighty God we say he was
[59:01] going to say this in New York he was
[59:03] going to say this in California he was
[59:05] going to say this in Edmonton New
[59:06] Brunswick he was going to preach this
[59:08] sermon of leadership and all that but
[59:10] there was going to be a man stand here
[59:11] one day and take 30 of them and make a
[59:13] sermon out of it for the present
[59:20] time that's why that was a voice of God
[59:24] yes let's don't throw this thing out it
[59:27] is the voice of God yes
[59:31] sir all right everybody with me on that
[59:33] so she is him we have our
[59:37] potentials everything we do when we are
[59:40] when we are made right again when our
[59:42] body is changed and we're standing in
[59:44] the uh well for us in the Millennium but
[59:47] when we go up to the to the new
[59:49] city that
[59:51] body is not going to be the body that
[59:54] your parents brought
[59:56] oh yeah it's going to be the same frame
[59:58] brother Brown said but not exactly the
[1:00:00] same
[1:00:01] gases right and it's not another one
[1:00:05] it's one that that your parents gave you
[1:00:07] but it's been
[1:00:08] changed because the one my parents gave
[1:00:11] me you're looking at a 64 year old piece
[1:00:13] of it right you're not going to look at
[1:00:15] that when we get to the other side
[1:00:17] you're going to look at a 20-y old piece
[1:00:19] of what do you what do you mean we're
[1:00:21] going to be changed that's why that says
[1:00:23] changed in a moment in the twinking of
[1:00:25] an eye right all
[1:00:26] right all right here yes
[1:00:41] please yes but I don't believe that body
[1:00:45] is hanging up there on a
[1:00:48] nail well now listen wait a minute
[1:00:51] brother random son he's got two or three
[1:00:52] quotes where they say he that you you
[1:00:54] know your body's being formed up there
[1:00:57] right there's a lot of people in this
[1:00:59] message believe that you got something
[1:01:01] hanging over in in another dimension and
[1:01:03] you step in it it's like a
[1:01:08] bodysuit brother Brown said that body is
[1:01:10] being formed in you right now right your
[1:01:13] soul is your theophany right amen what
[1:01:17] happens when somebody passes away listen
[1:01:20] the body is in the three dimensions
[1:01:22] right we can't go through this right
[1:01:24] here
[1:01:27] right right
[1:01:30] right but my soul if it leaves this
[1:01:34] body it goes right through there and
[1:01:36] never leaves a hole right just like
[1:01:39] right now what I'm saying today is going
[1:01:41] to go in the air waves and it's going
[1:01:43] right out through the through the the um
[1:01:46] fiber cable fibers up into the satellite
[1:01:49] over into another
[1:01:51] country just like that goes through
[1:01:55] clouds wood paper
[1:01:59] metal same way with your soul your soul
[1:02:03] that's what I was thinking the other day
[1:02:05] this thing is in such bad shape it is so
[1:02:08] this right here is so contrary to God to
[1:02:11] we literally limit that thing coming out
[1:02:13] of us
[1:02:16] right when does your soul leave your
[1:02:18] body when the body can't function the
[1:02:21] way a human functions right something
[1:02:24] has happened in your human body because
[1:02:27] this what you're looking at to me
[1:02:30] 98.6 this may be stupid as a the day is
[1:02:34] long but that 98.6 that you are right
[1:02:37] now when you put a thermometer on you
[1:02:40] you're everybody should be close to
[1:02:42] 98.6 degrees do you know why you're 98.6
[1:02:48] degrees because your cells are
[1:02:51] firing they're
[1:02:53] moving that's your soul
[1:02:56] your soul is causing that cuz what
[1:02:58] happens when you
[1:03:03] die yeah it ain't
[1:03:05] 98.6 I promise you
[1:03:09] that we
[1:03:11] were went down to brother Barry edins
[1:03:14] and and he I was there when he passed
[1:03:15] away but just to to make a point I was
[1:03:17] looking at him and we' been through
[1:03:19] through dad you know but he didn't have
[1:03:21] a an oxygen meter on his finger well
[1:03:24] brother Barry had an oxygen meter you
[1:03:25] know what that is tells your oxygen
[1:03:27] count like should be normal 98 97
[1:03:30] 999 if you're a smoker 88 but usually
[1:03:34] below 90 they get real that's right well
[1:03:38] they had one on brother Barry because he
[1:03:39] was home hospice and there's none of
[1:03:42] them going to listen to this so I don't
[1:03:44] want but I want to make a point when
[1:03:46] oxygen meter was on him when he was
[1:03:47] getting ready to die it went it was it
[1:03:50] stayed for an hour it stayed 92 3 94 92
[1:03:53] 93 94 and when he got got ready to pass
[1:03:56] away it went from 94 to 88 to 86 to
[1:04:04] 83 went all the way down to
[1:04:07] 60 went to
[1:04:09] 44 and blank and that's when he passed
[1:04:13] away that oxygen was flowing in but it
[1:04:16] was shutting down everything was
[1:04:19] shutting down and his soul was getting
[1:04:21] ready to leave his
[1:04:22] body so it was getting ready to take off
[1:04:25] so that oxygen meter kept getting
[1:04:27] smaller smaller smaller cuz he couldn't
[1:04:30] breathe oxygen anymore right his soul
[1:04:33] was getting ready to leave his body
[1:04:35] right that's how fragile we are but
[1:04:38] that's how your body works because
[1:04:40] you're at the temperature you are now
[1:04:41] it's because your soul is firing on all
[1:04:45] cylinders now remember if your
[1:04:46] temperature goes up it's because
[1:04:48] something in your body is wrong right
[1:04:52] right it's not your soul but something
[1:04:54] in your body has got wrong
[1:04:56] see that's the Paradox you can go have
[1:04:59] surgery but you can be born again and
[1:05:02] June went and had her two shoulder
[1:05:04] surgeries she ain't got two bad
[1:05:06] shoulders in her
[1:05:08] soul and the doctor didn't fix her her
[1:05:11] soul Dr Jesus did amen ain't that a
[1:05:16] paradox I mean you can go have all kind
[1:05:18] of things done I mean even like uh the
[1:05:20] brother at um what's his name brother
[1:05:21] Neil storm uh he had his arm cut off
[1:05:24] years ago he he always said he said it's
[1:05:27] there I just can't see it you just can't
[1:05:30] see it he said my theophany ain't got
[1:05:32] just one arm and he's right that's how
[1:05:36] that's how that we can't see in that
[1:05:37] other
[1:05:38] dimension but he's right I mean God's
[1:05:41] not going to create it over
[1:05:44] there when they cut when they cut Paul's
[1:05:46] head off his head rolled down into the
[1:05:48] into the
[1:05:49] ditch well when he stepped across the
[1:05:52] curtain of time he didn't have to pick
[1:05:54] his head up and put it back on his his
[1:05:56] body listen you can't kill a soul only
[1:06:00] God can kill a soul that's right you can
[1:06:02] be shot up and everything else and
[1:06:03] you'll leave the body that you're in
[1:06:05] because it can't function
[1:06:08] anymore but your soul is over there
[1:06:10] ain't got bullet holes in it ain't got
[1:06:12] scar marks on it that's right it's just
[1:06:15] as perfect as it ever was if you're a
[1:06:17] Christian right oh what a mighty God we
[1:06:20] serve he's got all this figured out
[1:06:21] we're just trying to all figure
[1:06:22] everything out but when you're if you're
[1:06:24] firing today what is making me do what
[1:06:27] I'm doing my soul right my soul is
[1:06:30] making me do what I'm doing cuz if my
[1:06:32] soul wasn't in his body I wouldn't be
[1:06:33] picking his finger up moving
[1:06:36] it praise God Amen okay all right let's
[1:06:40] go here's the second question when we go
[1:06:43] into the Rapture what happens to the
[1:06:47] left
[1:06:48] behind all right now remember there was
[1:06:50] a movie called Left Behind in some of
[1:06:52] the denominational World they believe
[1:06:56] that you can get saved after the Rapture
[1:06:58] takes
[1:07:00] place don't get silent on me you've
[1:07:02] never watched Left Behind go watch
[1:07:04] it with Kurt Cameron years ago planes
[1:07:07] are falling out of the sky cars are
[1:07:10] having wrecks because people are
[1:07:11] disappearing but he's there and somebody
[1:07:13] else is there and two or three other and
[1:07:14] some one of his friends is still there
[1:07:16] but they get saved after the Rapture
[1:07:19] takes
[1:07:20] place that ain't going to
[1:07:22] happen
[1:07:24] sorry that that's not going to happen
[1:07:26] thank God for a prophet that could tell
[1:07:29] us those things so when we go in the
[1:07:31] Rapture what happens to the left behind
[1:07:34] now here in first Thessalonians Paul
[1:07:36] tells us for this we say unto you by the
[1:07:39] word of the Lord that we which are alive
[1:07:41] and remain until the coming of the Lord
[1:07:43] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:07:45] in other words we're not going to
[1:07:47] prevent we can't hold back there's a bar
[1:07:50] holding back those Souls right Dad and
[1:07:52] all the different ones there's a bar all
[1:07:54] right but when that bar is loosed you
[1:07:56] ain't going to say oh no we're not ready
[1:07:58] for them yet hold the door no they're
[1:08:00] coming here they're coming they're
[1:08:02] coming here that we which are alive and
[1:08:05] remain until the coming of the Lord
[1:08:06] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:08:09] for the Lord himself shall descend now
[1:08:10] see the world is waiting on that event
[1:08:13] right there yep right we already seen it
[1:08:16] yes sir we're actually part of it amen
[1:08:19] see that's where you and I yeah we're
[1:08:22] special people cuz we pulled we picked
[1:08:25] mind of God and that's what we know what
[1:08:27] he's meaning when he says that for the
[1:08:29] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:08:31] with a shout we know what that is it's
[1:08:32] not
[1:08:33] he the voice of an archangel and Trump
[1:08:36] of God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:08:38] first you and I are included in that
[1:08:41] that's right amen these two
[1:08:44] scriptures are is everybody sitting in
[1:08:46] this room right now the first one is we
[1:08:49] which you're alive and remain all right
[1:08:52] and then those that are coming when the
[1:08:54] dead in Christ shall rise first then we
[1:08:57] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:08:58] caught up together with them in the
[1:08:59] clouds now look if you take that
[1:09:01] scripture you say well the Dead's going
[1:09:03] to raise then we're going to what are we
[1:09:05] just going to go up with them or no
[1:09:08] brother Brown said we'll be
[1:09:10] changed then Paul tells us again so you
[1:09:13] will be changed in the moment in twink
[1:09:14] of an eye you got to put why I took a
[1:09:16] prophet to put these scriptures together
[1:09:18] for
[1:09:19] us then we which are alive and remain
[1:09:21] may I interpolate will be changed right
[1:09:25] right in the moment in the twinking of
[1:09:26] an
[1:09:29] eye we which are alive and reain shall
[1:09:31] be caught up together with them in the
[1:09:32] clouds to meet the Lord in the air so
[1:09:34] shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore
[1:09:36] Comfort one another with these words 1
[1:09:38] Thessalonians 51 but of the times and

[1:11:31] horrible are not for me and you right
[1:11:35] amen that's why you want to try to get
[1:11:37] them all in because you know that
[1:11:39] destruction is coming right these things
[1:11:41] that happened in Florida and North
[1:11:43] Carolina toothache compared to what's
[1:11:45] coming yes sir
[1:11:48] toothache I was thinking yesterday all
[1:11:51] that effort and we've been doing it and
[1:11:52] brother Boyd's been doing a real good
[1:11:53] job him and Sister Janet
[1:11:56] we it didn't bother us right none of us
[1:11:58] down here I mean
[1:12:00] probably
[1:12:01] 45 of the
[1:12:03] 48 continent States not Alaska and
[1:12:06] Hawaii they weren't affected either but
[1:12:08] we weren't affected so we're sending
[1:12:11] resources they're going to have so much
[1:12:13] stuff they probably not going to want to
[1:12:14] do with them right but what if that
[1:12:18] happens all over the United States what
[1:12:21] if those events happen in California New
[1:12:25] Mexico Texas Kentucky Arizona new me uh
[1:12:30] New England states if that spreads
[1:12:32] itself out sorry
[1:12:35] folks it's going to be like that
[1:12:39] that that woman did a good job she was a
[1:12:42] mayor of one of them towns Sarasota or
[1:12:43] somewhere she said if you stay you're
[1:12:45] going to
[1:12:47] die she said you decide to stay write
[1:12:50] your name on your arm and your next of
[1:12:53] Ken on your arm cuz you're not going to
[1:12:55] make it right pretty plain well guess
[1:12:58] what if you're not bride material you're
[1:13:00] not going to make it and then you can't
[1:13:02] write your name you need to have your
[1:13:04] name written in the loue Book of Life
[1:13:06] don't worry about it writing on your
[1:13:07] hand right for when they shall say peace
[1:13:10] and safety then sudden destruction
[1:13:13] cometh upon
[1:13:15] them as travail upon a woman with child
[1:13:19] and they shall not
[1:13:21] Escape think about it again we we we've
[1:13:24] just sent
[1:13:25] tons of stuff to one area what if your
[1:13:29] area is affected and then your
[1:13:31] neighbor's area is
[1:13:32] affected the EMTs are going to be
[1:13:35] blessed their heart if they're left here
[1:13:37] they're going to go crazy they won't be
[1:13:39] able to get to all the the what's going
[1:13:42] on fire engines and all that stuff that
[1:13:44] we can take and send I mean they sent in
[1:13:47] Florida they had what they have like
[1:13:48] 5,000 trucks of electrical trucks and
[1:13:53] yeah they kind of got it all put
[1:13:54] together together in about 2 weeks what
[1:13:56] if that happens all over the United
[1:13:58] States they ain't enough trucks listen
[1:14:01] folks this is a wrath of God that's
[1:14:03] coming amen that you will not
[1:14:06] Escape right but ye Brethren are not in
[1:14:09] darkness now he's talking to us that
[1:14:12] that day should overtake you as a
[1:14:16] thief ye are all the children of light
[1:14:20] and the children of the day we are not
[1:14:23] of the night nor of the darkness
[1:14:25] therefore let us not sleep as do others
[1:14:28] but let us watch and be sober for they
[1:14:30] that sleep sleep in the night they that
[1:14:33] are drunk are drunken the night but let
[1:14:35] us who are of the day be sober putting
[1:14:39] on the breastplate of faith and love and
[1:14:41] for a helmet the hope of salvation for
[1:14:43] God hath not appointed us to
[1:14:47] wrath amen God said but God
[1:14:53] said I'm not going to point the this any
[1:14:55] of this that's going to happen I'm not
[1:14:56] pointing it to you for God hath not
[1:14:58] appointed us to wrath but to obtain
[1:15:01] salvation by our Lord Jesus
[1:15:06] Christ Matthew 25 then shall the Kingdom
[1:15:09] of Heaven be liken under 10 virgins
[1:15:12] which took their lamps and went forth to
[1:15:13] meet the bridegroom now listen folks
[1:15:16] this is 10 people that are part of
[1:15:20] Christianity this is not five the five
[1:15:23] foolish is not five drunks no right
[1:15:26] they're church members they're
[1:15:27] churchgoers right everybody with
[1:15:29] me five of them were wise five were
[1:15:32] foolish they that were foolish took
[1:15:34] their lamps and took no oil with
[1:15:37] them but the wise took oil in their
[1:15:40] vessel now what is the oil the Holy
[1:15:41] Ghost we know that while the bridegroom
[1:15:45] carried that's what's happening now the
[1:15:48] bridegroom is
[1:15:50] taring they all slumbered and slept
[1:15:56] and at midnight there was a cry made
[1:15:58] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[1:16:01] to meet him now look they all woke
[1:16:05] up
[1:16:08] right they all woke up and do was it
[1:16:11] five kept sleeping and five woke up then
[1:16:15] all those virgins woke up trim their
[1:16:21] lamps the problem is is like brother Bob
[1:16:23] was saying this the problem is is these
[1:16:26] over here in the foolish Parts they'd
[1:16:27] Sanctified they thought they had the
[1:16:29] Holy Ghost they thought they had the oil
[1:16:31] right these five over here continued on
[1:16:34] they made sure they went to their closet
[1:16:37] made sure they had oil in their lamps
[1:16:39] right you better make sure you got oil
[1:16:41] in your lamp amen right cuz the foolish
[1:16:44] said unto the wise give us of your oil
[1:16:46] for our lamps are gone out now look the
[1:16:49] Holy Ghost is for everybody you can't
[1:16:51] exhaust the Holy Ghost but there's going
[1:16:54] to be a time when he said this is
[1:16:56] it right brother Bown even makes a
[1:16:59] statement I tried to find it but I
[1:17:00] couldn't word it right where the Holy
[1:17:02] Ghost will lift up lift up off the
[1:17:05] Earth wow did you know what we're going
[1:17:08] with
[1:17:09] it now that Holy Ghost is going to come
[1:17:11] back on 144,000 but when we come up all
[1:17:15] that wrath is going to take place and
[1:17:17] the food they said under the wise give
[1:17:19] us of your oil for our lamps are gone
[1:17:22] out but the wise answered saying not so
[1:17:25] lest there be not enough for us and you
[1:17:27] sounds really selfish but you know what
[1:17:28] they're saying you've had
[1:17:30] time you've had time you've been with us
[1:17:33] we've been in the same
[1:17:38] church not so lest there be not enough
[1:17:40] for us and you but go and rather to them
[1:17:43] that sell and buy for yourself and while
[1:17:45] they went to buy the bridegroom came and
[1:17:47] they that were ready went in with him to
[1:17:49] the marriage and the door was
[1:17:53] shut no one else is going to be saved
[1:17:55] after that door shut right afterwards
[1:17:59] came also the other virgin saying Lord
[1:18:00] Lord open to us but he answered and said
[1:18:04] verily I say unto you I know you not
[1:18:07] watch therefore for you know neither the
[1:18:09] day nor the hour wherein the son of man
[1:18:14] cometh questions and answers conduct
[1:18:16] order and Doctrine at Mount trans
[1:18:19] Transfiguration before Jesus went to
[1:18:21] Calvary there stood Moses and Elijah
[1:18:23] standing there talking to him certainly
[1:18:25] they did they're not dead and they never
[1:18:27] died they're Mortals they got to die so
[1:18:29] they're just in the glorified State
[1:18:30] waiting for that time and then when they
[1:18:33] come back and preach exactly three and a
[1:18:34] half years under the anointing of the
[1:18:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost remember he
[1:18:38] didn't say New
[1:18:39] Birth under the anointing of the baptism
[1:18:42] of Holy Ghost while the blessings are
[1:18:43] taken from the
[1:18:45] Gentiles and the church is taken up and
[1:18:49] the cold formal church is hunted down
[1:18:51] like dogs by the communist and Roman
[1:18:53] parties and then they're hunted down and
[1:18:56] killed they listen they're still virgins
[1:18:59] they still got a testimony right they
[1:19:02] just missed it they didn't go they
[1:19:04] didn't further go further with God some
[1:19:06] preacher stood behind the pull pit and
[1:19:08] said you believe the message don't
[1:19:11] you you always
[1:19:16] was well how else are they going to hear
[1:19:18] that they going to hear from somebody
[1:19:20] that says you're all right we're not all
[1:19:23] right right
[1:19:27] amen then these prophets preached three
[1:19:29] and a half years the Bible said that
[1:19:31] they were killed in the street of C
[1:19:33] Sodom and Egypt where our Lord was
[1:19:35] crucified that's back in Jerusalem back
[1:19:38] in Jerusalem spiritually called so when
[1:19:40] we go up there's no more person saved I
[1:19:43] don't care listen they'll probably fill
[1:19:45] churches up when start stuff starts
[1:19:47] happening that's what happened in
[1:19:49] 9911 right they put prayer back in they
[1:19:52] had a National Day of Prayer and you
[1:19:53] can't even pray in school
[1:19:55] that's right but after a while what
[1:19:59] happened oh that's been 20 years ago now
[1:20:02] we we're good now we can do whatever we
[1:20:04] want to
[1:20:06] do taking sides with
[1:20:09] Jesus we we we realize in Revelations
[1:20:13] that just the one two three chapters to
[1:20:15] the church now remember Revelations 1 2
[1:20:17] and 3 the church goes up in the fourth
[1:20:20] chapter it does not return anymore till
[1:20:22] the 19th Chapter that's after the
[1:20:25] tribulation period when God calls out
[1:20:27] the Jews that's right and like Enoch he
[1:20:31] went up before one drop of rain every
[1:20:33] hit the earth he was gone then the
[1:20:36] tribulation set in now remember Enoch TI
[1:20:40] the bride Moses I mean Noah does not typ
[1:20:43] the
[1:20:49] bride no no types of natural
[1:20:52] Church they got to go through yeah
[1:20:56] right and like Enoch he went up before
[1:20:58] one drop of rain ever hit the earth he
[1:21:00] was gone then the tribulation set in see
[1:21:02] Noah was in the ark before any
[1:21:03] tribulation set in lot was out of Sodom
[1:21:06] before any tribulation set in and the
[1:21:08] church will be gone before any
[1:21:10] tribulation period now we know he's
[1:21:11] talking about the bride now during the
[1:21:13] tribulation that will be the sleeping
[1:21:15] virgin will be hunted down by the dragon
[1:21:17] and spurts water from his mouth which
[1:21:19] means multitudes and people armies that
[1:21:22] will search down and take this woman REM
[1:21:24] her seed and will kill her now that will
[1:21:27] be in the tribulation period but the
[1:21:29] church will go home right all right
[1:21:32] first
[1:21:33] seal now notice he'll conquer and almost
[1:21:36] has in his grip right now talking about
[1:21:38] Antichrist while he's still Antichrist
[1:21:41] before he can become Beast you talk
[1:21:43] about cruel punishment you just wait
[1:21:47] watch what them that's left here on
[1:21:49] Earth will have to go
[1:21:53] through there will be weeping and
[1:21:55] wailing and nashing of teeth for the
[1:21:57] dragon Rome spurted water out of his
[1:22:00] mouth and make war with the remnant of
[1:22:02] the woman's seed that was left upon the
[1:22:04] Earth after the bride had been selected
[1:22:07] and took out and the dragon made war
[1:22:10] with the remnant that didn't want to
[1:22:11] come in was hunted down and the real
[1:22:14] church will go through that if it was
[1:22:17] possible but you see they are done under
[1:22:19] the blood of the grace of Christ and not
[1:22:21] going through have no tribulation period
[1:22:23] the next thing for the church is the
[1:22:26] rapture that's why I said the great one
[1:22:28] of the great Revelations you can have
[1:22:29] all the other ones my Revelation is if
[1:22:32] I'm born again there's a lot of stuff in
[1:22:35] the Bible I ain't going to
[1:22:38] say I ain't going to be able to see it
[1:22:41] I'll read it I'll know it's going to
[1:22:44] happen but I really don't think though
[1:22:46] that we're going to be in a marriage
[1:22:47] supper and we're going to have to look
[1:22:48] down and go I wonder what's going on
[1:22:50] down no we know what's going to happen
[1:22:53] right future home just a little while
[1:22:55] will be summoned then the Rapture will
[1:22:57] come just a little bitty group like
[1:22:59] Enoch will be taken up then the remnant
[1:23:01] of the woman seed that keep the
[1:23:03] Commandments of God remember they're
[1:23:05] trying to be Christians right Jews have
[1:23:08] the testimony of Jesus Christ Gentiles
[1:23:10] will be hunted down like dogs and shall
[1:23:12] give their life for their testimony then
[1:23:15] one great morning the break of the
[1:23:16] Millennium for the honeymoon will start
[1:23:18] then the rest of the Dead live not till
[1:23:20] the end of the Thousand Years then at
[1:23:22] the end of the Thousand Years there was
[1:23:23] a judgment showing that ham was in the
[1:23:25] ark cuz remember judgment went a cross
[1:23:27] he had to be judged on the other side
[1:23:30] ones that heard it and rejected
[1:23:32] it will have to be
[1:23:36] judged all right now here's here's the
[1:23:38] number three please explain the two
[1:23:41] judgments now remember there's two
[1:23:42] judgments in the Bible all
[1:23:46] right here's the first one Romans
[1:23:51] 14:10 then but why Dost thou judge thy
[1:23:54] brother
[1:23:55] or why do thou said it not thy brother
[1:23:58] for we shall all stand before the
[1:24:00] Judgment seat of Christ now remember
[1:24:02] that doesn't say white Throne
[1:24:05] judgment that says the Judgment seat if
[1:24:08] you look in your Bible pilot had a
[1:24:11] judgment seat somebody in a couple of
[1:24:13] people in the Old Testament had a
[1:24:14] judgment seat and he was a judge he sat
[1:24:17] on the seat and they would come in and
[1:24:18] he would judge their issues all
[1:24:21] right for it is written as I live say
[1:24:24] the Lord every knee shall bow to me and
[1:24:26] every tongue shall confess to God as
[1:24:29] I've said many times before everybody's
[1:24:31] going to do that but me and you do it
[1:24:32] with honor yes others are going to be
[1:24:34] made to do it right so then every one of
[1:24:38] us shall give account of himself to
[1:24:41] God let us not therefore judge one
[1:24:44] another anymore but judge this rather
[1:24:46] that no man put a stumbling BL block or
[1:24:50] an occasion to fall in his brother's way
[1:24:57] 2 Corinthians
[1:24:59] 5:8 we are confident I say and willing
[1:25:02] rather to be absent from the body and to
[1:25:04] be present with the Lord wherefore we
[1:25:06] labor that whether present or absent we
[1:25:09] may be accepted of him for we must all
[1:25:12] appear before the Judgment seat of
[1:25:13] Christ that's the second time Paul said
[1:25:15] that that everyone may receive the
[1:25:18] things done in his
[1:25:21] body the Judgment of your soul is over
[1:25:25] but there's going to be some things
[1:25:26] lingering we'll get to it in a minute
[1:25:28] there's lingering things that you're
[1:25:29] either going to have to give an account
[1:25:30] here or there right
[1:25:33] right not of Salvation not of not of um
[1:25:37] eternal life but remember we all get
[1:25:40] crowns and we get places to we get
[1:25:43] Thrones
[1:25:44] dominions this thing ain't going to be I
[1:25:46] don't think it's going to be like we
[1:25:47] think it is you know the first
[1:25:49] government we talking about government
[1:25:51] government you know what the first
[1:25:52] government is was
[1:25:54] God set up the first
[1:25:57] government and he said he put it on his
[1:26:00] shoulders that's right we'll have
[1:26:03] government a governing body that's right
[1:26:07] aren't we going to be the governing
[1:26:10] body the
[1:26:11] bride in that
[1:26:14] City and then you got billions living
[1:26:17] outside the city that may not even know
[1:26:19] Jesus was even a person and we're going
[1:26:21] to get to tell him about him right oh
[1:26:24] you don't think that I
[1:26:26] do for we must all appear before the
[1:26:28] Judgment seat of Christ that everyone
[1:26:30] may receive the things done in his body
[1:26:32] according that he hath done whether it
[1:26:35] be good or bad now this is us this is
[1:26:38] not this is not the white Throne
[1:26:40] judgment all right this is the white
[1:26:42] Throne
[1:26:43] judgment but now watch in Revelations 20
[1:26:46] brother brownon makes a statement I
[1:26:48] didn't bring it cuz we're going
[1:26:49] to using more time than I thought we
[1:26:52] would Revelations 20:4 says says I saw
[1:26:57] Thrones and
[1:26:59] they sat upon
[1:27:02] them now
[1:27:05] obviously the people being judged are
[1:27:08] not going to be sitting on the throne
[1:27:10] let's not talking about them
[1:27:12] right so where are these Thrones and who
[1:27:15] are these
[1:27:16] people they're the bride that's right
[1:27:19] and I saw Thrones and they that sat upon
[1:27:22] them and judgment was given
[1:27:25] unto
[1:27:27] them and I saw the souls of them that
[1:27:30] would be headed for the witness of Jesus
[1:27:31] and for the word of God which had not
[1:27:33] worshiped the Beast neither his image
[1:27:35] neither had received his Mark upon his
[1:27:36] forehead or in his hands and they lived
[1:27:39] and reigned with Christ 1,000 years so
[1:27:41] that has nothing to do the people that
[1:27:43] are going to the white Throne judgment
[1:27:45] when they die they're not going to be
[1:27:46] alive through the tribulation I mean
[1:27:48] through the um um
[1:27:51] Millennium white throwing judgment is
[1:27:53] after the millennium right right amen
[1:27:56] but the rest of the Dead live not again
[1:27:58] until the thousand years were finished
[1:28:00] this is the first
[1:28:01] resurrection blessed and holy is he that
[1:28:03] hath part in the First Resurrection on
[1:28:05] such the second death hath no power but
[1:28:09] they shall be Priests of God and of
[1:28:10] Christ and shall reign with him a
[1:28:13] thousand
[1:28:14] years Revelations 20:1 and I saw a great
[1:28:18] white Throne now we've come to the place
[1:28:21] to where it's all going to culminate and
[1:28:22] be done with and him that sat on it for
[1:28:25] those face the for whose face the Earth
[1:28:27] and Heavens fled away now that's not
[1:28:32] us we know our God right and there was
[1:28:36] found no place for
[1:28:39] them you know these people been born
[1:28:41] lived and rub shoulders with you that
[1:28:43] there's no place for them except hell
[1:28:45] that's right wow and I saw the dead
[1:28:49] small and great stand before God now
[1:28:51] that's not
[1:28:52] us come on that's not
[1:28:55] us and the books were open and another
[1:28:58] book was open which is The Book of Life
[1:29:00] we may cover that a little bit later on
[1:29:02] and the dead were judged out of those
[1:29:04] things which were written in the books
[1:29:06] according to the works I thought we I
[1:29:09] thought we were judged by
[1:29:12] Christ that's right he took our judgment
[1:29:15] so whatever he is that's what we get
[1:29:17] right so he's the one sitting on the
[1:29:19] throne we're the one sitting on the
[1:29:21] Thrones amen judging the Earth and the
[1:29:25] Sea gave up the dead which were in it
[1:29:27] and death and Hell delivered up the dead
[1:29:29] which were in them and they were judged
[1:29:31] every man according to the works you and
[1:29:33] I will never as bride be judged
[1:29:36] according to our works for eternal life
[1:29:39] thereby with me but you will have to be
[1:29:41] judged we're going to get to it in a
[1:29:43] minute some men sins go before some go
[1:29:46] after all right so hang on a
[1:29:49] minute we are going to all Paul's right
[1:29:52] we're all going to go before the
[1:29:53] Judgment seat of Christ but that's not
[1:29:55] the white Throne judgment it's two
[1:29:56] different judgments all right is
[1:29:58] everybody with me
[1:30:00] right and the Sea gave up the dead death
[1:30:03] and Hell delivered up the dead which
[1:30:04] were in them and they were judged every
[1:30:06] man according to the works and death and
[1:30:08] hell were cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:30:10] this is the second death and whosoever
[1:30:12] was not found written in the Book of
[1:30:13] Life was cast in the Lake of Fire there
[1:30:16] some people named was even in the
[1:30:18] book Canon father God knew if you give
[1:30:22] them a million years to repent they
[1:30:23] never would repent
[1:30:26] right that's the God I serve the god
[1:30:29] that knows everything
[1:30:31] amen Daniel 7 and I beheld till the
[1:30:34] Thrones there we go again plural were
[1:30:37] cast down and the Ancient of Days did
[1:30:39] sit remember what is he the judge and
[1:30:41] whose garment was white as snow and the
[1:30:43] hair of his head like pure wool his
[1:30:45] throne was like fiery flame and his
[1:30:47] wheels burning fire a fiery steam issued
[1:30:50] and came forth before him thousands now
[1:30:53] love this right here thousand
[1:30:57] thousands ministered unto him
[1:31:01] stop and 10,000 time 10,000 stood before
[1:31:07] him am there's way more people going to
[1:31:10] be judged before him than they are
[1:31:12] ministering to him brother Brown said
[1:31:14] said the bride ministers to her husband
[1:31:16] right so that's the bride thousand
[1:31:19] thousands but look down there 10,000
[1:31:22] time 10,000 stood before him the
[1:31:26] Judgment was set and the books were
[1:31:30] open now what does that mean using the
[1:31:32] context of a legal trial to refer to a
[1:31:34] final finding statement or ruling based
[1:31:37] on a considered weight of evidence
[1:31:39] talking about judgment called
[1:31:43] adjudication which you take what does a
[1:31:45] judge do a judge sits there and takes
[1:31:48] this side and this side and he judges
[1:31:50] them right all right now remember Paul
[1:31:54] tells
[1:31:54] us a little bit later on Paul tells us
[1:31:58] that he's the righteous
[1:32:00] judge but then he tells us that the
[1:32:03] Saints will judge the earth and the
[1:32:04] Saints will judge the Angels 1
[1:32:06] Corinthians 2:14 but the natural man now
[1:32:09] this is where watch real quick but the
[1:32:12] natural man receiveth not the things of
[1:32:14] the spirit of God all right they're
[1:32:16] separated there's a group of people that
[1:32:18] don't care about God so they don't
[1:32:20] receive receive any of the blessings of
[1:32:22] God right
[1:32:24] for they are foolishness unto him
[1:32:26] neither can he know them because they're
[1:32:29] spiritually discerned but now
[1:32:32] watch brother Bob we the Judgment you
[1:32:35] know there's a place in the Bible says
[1:32:36] judgment one and don't judge and do this
[1:32:39] and do that and if we we read a
[1:32:41] scripture for a communion it says judge
[1:32:43] not that you be not judged watch now
[1:32:45] this is where it all penel down to one
[1:32:47] little area but he that is spiritual
[1:32:51] judges all things right amen
[1:32:56] EXA yet he
[1:32:58] himself is judged of no
[1:33:02] man
[1:33:04] wow yes
[1:33:10] sirud that's correct I think I got I
[1:33:12] think I may have that scripture but I
[1:33:14] know I have it yes he didn't say not
[1:33:16] judge no no but you can't you what he's
[1:33:20] saying is and and let me put it this way
[1:33:24] we go and I got to have some water but I
[1:33:26] got to get this
[1:33:33] Bible people people will say uh don't
[1:33:36] judge me because the Bible says you know
[1:33:38] judge notless be judged first
[1:33:46] right right but now
[1:33:50] watch this is the Bible this is the word
[1:33:53] of God
[1:33:54] right it's not a pair of
[1:33:59] binoculars it's a
[1:34:02] mirror it's not a pair of
[1:34:04] binoculars I'm looking at your I'm
[1:34:07] judging
[1:34:10] you judge
[1:34:12] yourself that you be not
[1:34:14] judged right now listen folks sometimes
[1:34:18] I have to put on
[1:34:21] binoculars being a pastor I got to watch
[1:34:23] for the Sheep
[1:34:24] right okay I have to do that but you got
[1:34:26] to do it with righteous judgment not
[1:34:29] with well I think I'm right and you're
[1:34:31] wrong but use this as a mirror quit
[1:34:34] doing this well if if if if brother boy
[1:34:37] is straighten
[1:34:40] up well he just said him I'll amen me
[1:34:43] brother way to straighten up everybody
[1:34:46] else says
[1:34:47] amen and start reflecting yourself cuz
[1:34:49] right here but he that is spiritual
[1:34:53] judgest all things
[1:34:57] am yet he himself is judged of no man
[1:35:01] now watch for who hath known the mind of
[1:35:05] the Lord you got to have because Paul
[1:35:08] says look that he may instruct
[1:35:11] him for who hath known the mind of the
[1:35:14] Lord who the
[1:35:15] bride and it's got to be a mature
[1:35:18] bride I'm not going to go into a
[1:35:20] courtroom and have a case tried and
[1:35:25] I have a June sitting
[1:35:28] judging she's like
[1:35:31] really what would she know it she would
[1:35:33] have no
[1:35:34] knowledge we have a righteous judge that
[1:35:37] has knowledge we have a we have a white
[1:35:39] wigged one but even in the courts of the
[1:35:41] United States they don't put people in
[1:35:43] judgeship at 20 years old no how many of
[1:35:47] you ever walked I've never been but one
[1:35:48] courtroom and he was an old man
[1:35:54] why because you have to have if you're
[1:35:56] spiritual you can discern spiritual
[1:35:58] things now watch for who hath known the
[1:36:00] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[1:36:02] him but we
[1:36:03] have all right we can't instruct God and
[1:36:07] him do the
[1:36:09] Judgment but we have that same mind of
[1:36:12] the judge
[1:36:14] right if we do it right if we
[1:36:17] spiritually discern things watch this
[1:36:20] right
[1:36:21] here moreover it is requ ired in
[1:36:24] stewards that a man be found
[1:36:26] faithful but with me it is a very small
[1:36:30] thing that I should be judged of you now
[1:36:31] this is
[1:36:32] Paul talking to the Corinthians who were
[1:36:35] babies right Corinthians the book of
[1:36:39] Correction they were babies they
[1:36:41] worshiped Idols they they had the Lord's
[1:36:44] supper and they were getting drunk and
[1:36:46] they were having a a feast instead of
[1:36:49] having the solemn Lord's Supper Paul had
[1:36:51] to always tell them you're looking at
[1:36:53] Idols you're doing this you're doing
[1:36:55] that stop it quit right right
[1:37:00] right but with me is a very small thing
[1:37:03] that I should be judged of you or of
[1:37:06] man's
[1:37:07] judgment yay I judge not my own
[1:37:11] self now hold
[1:37:13] on if you stop right there then you've
[1:37:15] done away with me saying this needs to
[1:37:17] be a mirror cuz that's what you do you
[1:37:19] judge
[1:37:20] yourself right
[1:37:24] for I know nothing by
[1:37:29] myself yet am I not hereby
[1:37:33] Justified but he that judges me is the
[1:37:35] Lord
[1:37:37] right see if you take somebody like
[1:37:42] Paul and brother brandham that were true
[1:37:44] prophets prophets to the end time to
[1:37:46] their time and they were true word
[1:37:48] prophets they are judged of no
[1:37:51] man they're judged of God only right we
[1:37:55] don't Jud we have no right to judge
[1:37:57] brother brandom that's right cuz we're
[1:37:59] not spiritually Discerning it that at
[1:38:02] that high of an
[1:38:04] office is that good enough at that high
[1:38:06] of an office you don't judge a prophet
[1:38:09] you can't say brother Ryan was wrong
[1:38:11] here here and here and here no he told
[1:38:12] you when he was wrong and I accept that
[1:38:15] amen all the other times he's right
[1:38:19] right for I know nothing by
[1:38:21] myself yet am I not hereby Justified but
[1:38:24] he that judges me is the Lord now watch
[1:38:26] therefore judge nothing before the
[1:38:30] time right until the Lord come who both
[1:38:33] will bring to light the hidden things of
[1:38:36] darkness and will make manifest the
[1:38:38] counsels of the
[1:38:41] heart and then shall every man have
[1:38:44] Praise of God now let's break this down
[1:38:46] just for a second therefore judge
[1:38:49] nothing before the time until the Lord
[1:38:51] come who both will bring to light the
[1:38:53] hidden things of darkness and will make
[1:38:55] manifest the counsels of the heart all
[1:38:57] right and then shall every man have
[1:39:00] Praise of God 1 Timothy 5: 24 some men's
[1:39:05] sins are open
[1:39:09] beforehand I've done something against
[1:39:11] brother
[1:39:12] Donnie I've said publicly or even
[1:39:16] privately forgive me of that sin if you
[1:39:19] do that it's done right now if I do
[1:39:23] something to brother Donnie and I don't
[1:39:25] ask
[1:39:27] forgiveness it will follow me to that
[1:39:30] day that we're at the Judgment seat of
[1:39:32] Christ where we got to give an account
[1:39:34] of the things that we not what we got
[1:39:37] rid of here but what we carry there even
[1:39:40] being born again Christians right come
[1:39:44] on cuz if we all got to stand before the
[1:39:46] Judgment seat of Christ there is a
[1:39:48] judgment
[1:39:49] right some men's sins are open
[1:39:52] beforehand going before to judgment and
[1:39:56] some men they follow after in other
[1:40:00] words they go with you well somewhere as
[1:40:03] I said before Christianity is based on
[1:40:06] righteous
[1:40:08] judgment everything actually after the
[1:40:12] fall is under
[1:40:15] judgment amen or no right all
[1:40:19] right now
[1:40:21] watch likewise all Al the good works of
[1:40:24] some are manifest
[1:40:28] beforehand and they that are
[1:40:31] otherwise cannot be
[1:40:33] hit you remember I told you several
[1:40:35] years ago when I started preaching after
[1:40:37] after dad's um stroke I told you that
[1:40:41] the Lord kept convicting me about that
[1:40:42] one thing I said about a brother right
[1:40:46] right right if I had not got that right
[1:40:50] number one it would have hindered my
[1:40:51] experience it would have hindered my
[1:40:53] Ministry yes sir you know why cuz it eat
[1:40:56] at me that's right he didn't even know
[1:40:59] it it eat at me y so when I called him
[1:41:03] and got rid of that listen I'm telling
[1:41:05] you asking forgiveness is one of the
[1:41:07] greatest feelings you'll ever get in
[1:41:09] your life
[1:41:11] amen it's the mirror that's right but
[1:41:14] you'll never be judged for that if you
[1:41:16] get it out but right here God said he'll
[1:41:19] get it right that scripture before he's
[1:41:22] going to get it right into the counsel
[1:41:24] of your heart yeah he's going to dig it
[1:41:27] out and he's going to tell us whatever
[1:41:30] time that judgment is the Judgment seed
[1:41:32] of Christ he's going to say brother Wade
[1:41:36] you wrong brother Donnie and you didn't
[1:41:38] ask
[1:41:40] forgiveness
[1:41:42] right now here's the
[1:41:45] problem this is not a blanket
[1:41:48] forgiveness will y'all just forgive me
[1:41:49] for anything I've done
[1:41:53] yes and I can't stand somebody to say
[1:41:55] this if I've done something wrong good
[1:42:00] Lord if I've done means I had I don't
[1:42:03] think I have but you'll never get
[1:42:04] forgiven for that you're going to it's
[1:42:06] going to judge you when you get
[1:42:10] there Godly
[1:42:12] sorrow the Bible says leads us to
[1:42:14] repentance right when you're sorrow
[1:42:17] really sorry I was I wasn't sorry for
[1:42:19] what I said about that brother when I
[1:42:21] said it cuz I meant it
[1:42:25] but it was
[1:42:26] wrong and when I called him he said
[1:42:28] brother wait I don't even know what
[1:42:29] you're talking about said but I sure
[1:42:31] forgive you for it and that will never
[1:42:34] have to go with me right I think a lot
[1:42:37] of the times even our Christian
[1:42:39] experiences hindered because we think
[1:42:41] we're right so much in our
[1:42:44] eyes that we don't see
[1:42:51] ourselves we just leave it right there
[1:42:54] some men's sins are open beforehand some
[1:42:56] going before the judgment and some mens
[1:42:58] they follow after likewise also the good
[1:43:01] works of some are manifest beforehand
[1:43:03] and they that are otherwise cannot be
[1:43:05] hid you we're not going to hide anything
[1:43:07] from God I don't care if you're an
[1:43:08] absolute Christian you still got a
[1:43:11] spirit y that is contrary to God right
[1:43:16] regardless you got things in your spirit
[1:43:19] that's not in your soul amen right vice
[1:43:22] versa exactly right
[1:43:28] now here's one right here Book of Luke
[1:43:30] Luke 6:36 y'all just hang with me that
[1:43:33] these questions are
[1:43:34] important it's important the person to
[1:43:36] ask you I remember brother R said that
[1:43:38] one time he said this may not to be
[1:43:39] important to you but it's important to
[1:43:40] the person that asked the question all
[1:43:42] right Luke 6:36 be ye therefore merciful
[1:43:45] as your father also is merciful we ought
[1:43:47] to try that sometime judge not now watch
[1:43:49] Judge not and you shall not be judged
[1:43:52] but now we got to keep going can't stop
[1:43:55] there that's right or either I'd have
[1:43:58] nothing to preach brother Randon would
[1:43:59] had nothing to preach Jesus would have
[1:44:00] had nothing to preach if there was not
[1:44:02] some kind of judgment that went with
[1:44:04] what was being said right judge not and
[1:44:07] you shall not be judged look condemn not
[1:44:10] and you shall not be condemned
[1:44:13] forgive and you'll be forgiven
[1:44:16] right if you can't forgive God's not
[1:44:18] going to forgive you that's right I mean
[1:44:21] with an honest heart I'm sorry sorry I
[1:44:24] crossed the line I did something
[1:44:27] wrong but if I
[1:44:30] didn't give and it shall be given unto
[1:44:34] you good measure press down and shaken
[1:44:38] together now this is Jesus talking and
[1:44:41] running over shall men give unto your
[1:44:44] bosom why because you give give it shall
[1:44:46] be given to you good measure pressed
[1:44:47] down and shaken together and running
[1:44:49] over shall men give un your into your
[1:44:52] bosom for with the the same measure that
[1:44:54] you meet with all it shall be measured
[1:44:57] to you again yes Jesus said that 1
[1:45:02] Corinthians 6
[1:45:04] verse1 now here's Paul this is the
[1:45:08] prophet dare any of you having a matter
[1:45:10] against another go to law before the
[1:45:12] unjust and not before the Saints he's
[1:45:14] asking them a
[1:45:15] question and let's stop right here
[1:45:17] because somebody asked me a question one
[1:45:19] time this says what
[1:45:24] we'll read them a little bit further but
[1:45:25] dare any of you having a matter against
[1:45:27] another now he's who's he talking
[1:45:30] to the Bible is written to
[1:45:33] Christians everybody with me he's
[1:45:36] talking about a brother suing a brother
[1:45:39] or a brother taking another brother to
[1:45:41] court he didn't say a
[1:45:44] heathen listen if somebody hits you and
[1:45:47] and and breaks your body up and you know
[1:45:49] and and and it was their fault and they
[1:45:51] were drunk you listen you can do what
[1:45:53] you want to

[1:45:58] brother to court that ain't your

[1:46:38] heaven no he said it was hard for a
[1:46:40] lawyer to enter Heaven that's right you
[1:46:42] don't have many Bible studies down there
[1:46:44] do you
[1:46:46] nope do you not know that the Saints
[1:46:49] shall judge the
[1:46:51] world and if the world shall be judged
[1:46:54] by you are you unworthy to judge the
[1:46:56] smallest matters know ye not that we
[1:46:59] shall J judge
[1:47:01] Angels how much more things that pertain
[1:47:04] to this
[1:47:06] life and yes if you have an ought
[1:47:08] against a brother let us come together
[1:47:10] here brother brother bring the deacons
[1:47:12] bring the elders the the preachers let's
[1:47:15] get this thing worked out don't take
[1:47:17] somebody to court and sue a brother cuz
[1:47:19] somebody backed out here and our parking
[1:47:21] lot's full and morning most of the time

[1:47:38] right and you can do what you want to do
[1:47:40] you can forgive him or sue him he ain't
[1:47:41] going to make it this is not what this
[1:47:43] is talking about this is people in a
[1:47:45] church
[1:47:46] sitting taking I I don't like brother Lu
[1:47:49] he did something to me I'm gonna take
[1:47:50] him to court and we're GNA let heathens
[1:47:53] decide our
[1:47:55] fith no if then you have judgments of
[1:47:59] things pertaining to this life watch set
[1:48:02] them to judge who are least esteemed in
[1:48:04] the
[1:48:05] church yall know what that
[1:48:08] means the least person in the
[1:48:11] church that has the Holy Ghost
[1:48:14] now can be set in judgment can can
[1:48:17] determine judgment that's what he says
[1:48:20] set them to judge who are least esteemed
[1:48:22] in the church I speak to your shame is
[1:48:25] it so that there's not a wise man among
[1:48:28] you what is one of the nine gifts
[1:48:33] wisdom know not one that shall be able
[1:48:36] to judge between his
[1:48:38] brother so don't take a brother to court
[1:48:41] we judge it here right Revelations 19
[1:48:44] verse1 we got to hurry and after these
[1:48:46] things I heard a great voice of much
[1:48:47] people in heaven saying Hallelujah
[1:48:49] Salvation and Glory and Honor and power
[1:48:51] Toto the Lord our God
[1:48:53] for true and righteous are his judgments
[1:48:57] for he hath judged the great which
[1:49:00] did corrupt the Earth with a fornication
[1:49:02] now we're going to get to something in
[1:49:04] just a second where does judgment
[1:49:10] begin Bible's pretty plain brother brand
[1:49:13] has like 200 quotes judgment begins at
[1:49:16] the house of the Lord right but not the
[1:49:20] building it's not the Judgment of the
[1:49:22] the
[1:49:23] church you know no we'll get to
[1:49:28] it Ecclesiastes
[1:49:32] 314 I know that whatsoever God doeth it
[1:49:35] shall be forever nothing can be put to
[1:49:38] it nor taken from it
[1:49:41] right thank God for
[1:49:43] that God can't lie amen God can't tell
[1:49:46] an untruth God can't speak and it not be
[1:49:49] true right and God doeth it that man
[1:49:53] should fear before
[1:49:55] him that which hath been is
[1:49:58] now and that which is to be Authority
[1:50:03] been and God requires that which is
[1:50:06] passed so he covered what Jesus Christ
[1:50:08] the same yesterday today and forever now
[1:50:12] watch and moreover I saw Under the Sun
[1:50:16] the place of
[1:50:17] judgment that the wickedness was there
[1:50:21] and the place of right
[1:50:23] rightousness watch that iniquity was
[1:50:27] there
[1:50:29] wow I said in my heart God shall judge
[1:50:33] the
[1:50:34] righteous and the wicked
[1:50:37] right now to me there's your two
[1:50:41] judgments CU remember what is Iniquity
[1:50:44] remember it's the first seal but you
[1:50:45] know what iniquity is it's it's knowing
[1:50:48] I have an odd against
[1:50:50] Louise knowing I have an against
[1:50:54] Louise and don't do anything about it
[1:50:56] that's
[1:50:57] iniquity the Bible said iniquity shall
[1:50:59] abound and that's not just for out there
[1:51:02] that's for in here right here's what it
[1:51:04] says look and the place of righteousness
[1:51:07] that iniquity was
[1:51:11] there I said in my heart God shall judge
[1:51:15] the righteous judgment seed of Christ
[1:51:18] and the wicked that didn't accept
[1:51:21] Christ white throwing judgment for there
[1:51:25] is a time there for every purpose and
[1:51:28] for every
[1:51:29] work Ecclesiastes is pretty heavy but if
[1:51:32] you read it it's good for you Romans 2
[1:51:34] ver4 despises thou The Riches of his
[1:51:37] goodness and forbearance and
[1:51:38] longsuffering not knowing that the
[1:51:40] goodness of God see leadth you to
[1:51:43] repentance if you don't believe you need
[1:51:45] to repent you won't right hello right
[1:51:49] you won't cuz that's the Devil's
[1:51:51] Playground no you ain't got to do
[1:51:55] that what brother Dell say if you didn't
[1:51:57] get it out of the way real quick about 2
[1:51:59] days later it was their fault right a't
[1:52:02] that the
[1:52:03] truth a't that the
[1:52:05] truth right it was their fault to begin
[1:52:09] with yeah
[1:52:11] right but after th hardness and
[1:52:14] impenitent
[1:52:16] heart treasur up unto thyself wrath what
[1:52:21] building up unconfessed sin building up
[1:52:26] iniquity against the day of Wrath and
[1:52:28] revelation of the righteous Judgment of
[1:52:31] God now watch who will render to every
[1:52:34] man according to his
[1:52:37] deeds questions and answers now we've
[1:52:40] been through that if a man can be a
[1:52:42] sinner and be punished forever he can't
[1:52:44] be punished forever because he's got
[1:52:45] eternal life if he's got eternal life
[1:52:47] he's saved you know what he's covering
[1:52:48] so there's only one type of eternal life
[1:52:50] and that's the Zoey life of God
[1:52:53] and he can't perish but the wicked are
[1:52:55] in a place of waiting in torment for
[1:52:58] their judgment they're not being judged
[1:52:59] right now they're in a place holding for
[1:53:02] their judgment but it's not a nice place
[1:53:05] to be judged according to the Deeds Done
[1:53:07] in the body at the last day but some
[1:53:09] men's sins go before them some follow
[1:53:12] after them now if we confess our sins
[1:53:16] he's just to forgive
[1:53:18] us therefore we'll never have to stand
[1:53:21] the Judgment of of
[1:53:23] God the white Throne judgment we will
[1:53:25] not stand right you get it look Romans
[1:53:28] 8:1 therefore there's no condemnation to
[1:53:30] them they're in Christ Jesus pass from
[1:53:32] death into life let's keep continue to
[1:53:34] saf for time and I've been accepted in
[1:53:36] Christ Christ took my judgment and I
[1:53:38] accepted his perpetuation for my sins
[1:53:41] how can God judge
[1:53:43] me he's done judge
[1:53:47] me when he judged Christ then I'm free
[1:53:51] from judgment then when I see the blood
[1:53:54] I'll pass over you see but now the
[1:53:56] wicked is not so he goes into a place of
[1:53:59] torment and we know that that's true the
[1:54:01] wicked is alive he's in a place of
[1:54:04] Torment 1 Peter 4:16 yet if any man
[1:54:08] suffer as a Christian let him not be
[1:54:10] ashamed but let him glorify God in this
[1:54:12] behalf for the time has come that
[1:54:14] judgment must begin at the house of
[1:54:17] God and if it first began at
[1:54:21] us what shall the end of them that obey
[1:54:24] not the gospel of God in other words if
[1:54:26] we're being judged here oh my the world
[1:54:29] has got to go to the white Throne
[1:54:30] judgment there's no other they weren't
[1:54:32] judged in here I don't mean in this
[1:54:34] building I mean in the word of God
[1:54:36] right and if the rightous scarcely be
[1:54:39] saved where should the ungodly and The
[1:54:40] Sinner appear wherefore let them that
[1:54:43] suffer according to the will of God
[1:54:45] commit the keeping of their souls to him
[1:54:48] in well doing as into to a faithful
[1:54:51] creator
[1:54:53] brother Bri Redemption by judgment
[1:54:55] listen cadis barnel was once the
[1:54:57] Judgment seat of the world there a great
[1:54:59] spring and many little Springs leading
[1:55:01] off of it which is the perfect type
[1:55:03] again Christ being the Big Spring the
[1:55:05] church be the little spring off of
[1:55:07] Christ the Judgment
[1:55:09] seat judgment begins at the house of God
[1:55:12] here's where we are
[1:55:15] judged and isn't it a pity that when we
[1:55:17] see that we're
[1:55:19] wrong watch and doing the wrong thing
[1:55:22] living the wrong kind of Life
[1:55:24] associating wrong and everything that
[1:55:26] we're just not big enough to walk up and
[1:55:29] say God I'm sorry I'm the one that's
[1:55:31] wrong that's right
[1:55:34] wow you're right and I'm wrong and you
[1:55:37] forgive me and help me to do better the
[1:55:39] next time if we if we just that that
[1:55:43] real about ourselves but we don't we
[1:55:46] hear the gospel preached and we say oh
[1:55:48] well I don't even believe it that way
[1:55:52] 2 Timothy
[1:55:56] 4:7 Paul's coming to the end of his life
[1:55:58] he said I fought a good fight finished
[1:56:00] my course I've kept the faith henceforth
[1:56:04] there's laid up for me a crown of
[1:56:05] righteousness which the Lord the
[1:56:08] righteous
[1:56:11] judge shall give me at that day and not
[1:56:15] to me only but unto all them also that
[1:56:18] love is appearing he's appeared right
[1:56:22] have we missed
[1:56:24] it so what happens we have two judgments
[1:56:28] one judgment is a judgment Deeds of the
[1:56:30] body whether good or bad when we leave
[1:56:34] this place then you got a white Throne
[1:56:36] judgment that's over a thousand years
[1:56:39] later that is going to be the thousands
[1:56:42] times 10 thousands of people are going
[1:56:44] to be
[1:56:45] judged by the word of God which that's
[1:56:48] what you
[1:56:49] are right so so there's your two
[1:56:52] judgments all right couple more what is
[1:56:56] discernment now here's a quote from
[1:56:58] brother
[1:56:59] brandham he knows that if the people now
[1:57:01] we've quoted this many times but let's
[1:57:02] see if we can understand it a little
[1:57:04] better he knows that if the people get
[1:57:06] the true revelation of the true church
[1:57:09] and that and what she is and what she
[1:57:11] stands for and that she can do the
[1:57:13] greater work she will be an invincible
[1:57:15] Army if they get a true revelation of
[1:57:17] the two Spirits within the framework of
[1:57:19] the Christian church let me stop you
[1:57:21] right here
[1:57:22] Judas and Jesus were in the same
[1:57:31] church Judas was Sanctified according to
[1:57:33] the
[1:57:34] Bible hello Jesus Sanctified
[1:57:38] him
[1:57:42] hello that's how close it
[1:57:44] is Jesus was the only one that knew who
[1:57:47] Judas really was the other 11 didn't
[1:57:50] have a clue they were totally
[1:57:52] out and left
[1:57:55] fi and by God's spirit discern now
[1:57:59] that's the question is what is the
[1:58:01] discernment of that and withstand the
[1:58:03] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[1:58:05] powerless before her he will be as
[1:58:08] definitely thwarted today as when Christ
[1:58:09] withstood his every effort to gain power
[1:58:11] over him in the desert yes Satan hates
[1:58:15] Revelation but we love it and with true
[1:58:17] Revelation in our lives the Gates of
[1:58:18] Hell cannot Prevail against us but we
[1:58:21] will prevail over them now we just got
[1:58:24] finished talking about judgment judgment
[1:58:26] and discernment go
[1:58:29] together because you discern to
[1:58:33] judge right all right you discern to
[1:58:36] judge now discernment means the ability
[1:58:39] to judge well or in Christian context
[1:58:43] perception in the absence of judgment
[1:58:45] with a view to obtaining spiritual
[1:58:47] guidance and understanding then the
[1:58:49] example was without providing for a time
[1:58:51] of healing and discernment there will be
[1:58:53] no hope of living through this present
[1:58:54] moment now brother Brown tells
[1:58:57] us 600 and something times he talks
[1:59:00] about Discerning in the prayer
[1:59:02] line now what happened during that
[1:59:06] discernment CU that's a perfect
[1:59:09] example he goes into somebody's
[1:59:12] life God goes into their life he don't
[1:59:15] right God takes him into their life and
[1:59:19] by discernment says you wor the there
[1:59:22] yesterday he had on a blue coat he had a
[1:59:25] um clipboard in his hand the nurse was
[1:59:27] standing beside of him and there was
[1:59:28] your
[1:59:29] X-ray now he took all
[1:59:32] that all that was discerned to be the
[1:59:37] truth all right and then off of that he
[1:59:41] made a judgment because of what the
[1:59:43] person was standing there because
[1:59:45] remember he said sister one time he say
[1:59:48] sister you're you're not getting this
[1:59:51] it's going over for you you know she he
[1:59:52] was really trying
[1:59:54] to and he was talking to her she was the
[1:59:57] only one he was talking to and she
[1:59:59] missed
[2:00:00] it cuz she didn't discern
[2:00:03] right now
[2:00:05] watch Romans 12 ver1 now what is
[2:00:07] discernment I beseech you therefore
[2:00:09] brethren for the mercies of God that you
[2:00:11] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[2:00:13] wholly acceptable unto God which is your
[2:00:15] reasonable service and be not conformed
[2:00:19] to this world but be you transformed by
[2:00:21] the renewing over your mind now watch
[2:00:23] that you may
[2:00:24] prove now that word prove if you look it
[2:00:27] up in the in the Greek that word prove
[2:00:29] means discern or
[2:00:32] judge cuz you got to be able to discern
[2:00:35] the good and acceptable perfect will of
[2:00:38] God as brother Bob and I were talking a
[2:00:41] little bit ago and I'm working on a
[2:00:43] sermon somebody come up to you and say
[2:00:46] the Lord spoke to me and told me X right
[2:00:50] well I'll promise you folks if act don't
[2:00:52] come to pass you probably got a
[2:00:55] different
[2:00:56] Lord you're listening to the wrong
[2:01:01] Lord somebody said the other day we
[2:01:03] talking said that's the most that word
[2:01:05] is what the Lord told me what the Lord
[2:01:07] told me but the Lord's been wrong a
[2:01:10] lot no sorry he ain't wrong you're
[2:01:13] listening to the wrong Lord cuz remember
[2:01:15] the Satan can be the Lord of your
[2:01:17] life oh come on oh no not me I'm a
[2:01:20] Christian no don't start that with me
[2:01:23] he'll jump on all of us if you let him
[2:01:25] right exactly but when you say the Lord
[2:01:28] told me because listen when you discern
[2:01:30] that it's God it's got to come to
[2:01:33] pass that's right if you discern it's
[2:01:36] God and it don't come to pass brother R
[2:01:39] said you got an evil spirit on you
[2:01:42] remember what brother R said one to
[2:01:43] stand up and and and speak in tongues
[2:01:46] and one prophesy or somebody prophesy
[2:01:48] and say tomorrow brother Anderson's
[2:01:50] house you going to burn you need get out
[2:01:52] of your house well tomorrow nothing
[2:01:53] happens next day nothing happen he said
[2:01:55] you've got an evil spirit on that person
[2:01:58] and in your church right find it it'll
[2:02:00] tell you he said because God's never
[2:02:03] wrong the discernment brother R had
[2:02:06] never was wrong because it wasn't his it
[2:02:07] was God's
[2:02:09] right and be not conformed to the world
[2:02:12] but be transformed by the renewing of
[2:02:14] your of your mind that you may prove
[2:02:16] what is that good and acceptable and
[2:02:18] perfect will of God
[2:02:22] so back over here we
[2:02:25] see discern and withstand the Antichrist
[2:02:27] Spirit now remember where is the
[2:02:29] Antichrist Spirit oh it's out there in
[2:02:32] the Baptist Church oh I'm sorry it's in
[2:02:35] Rome it's at the Vatican it might have
[2:02:39] come out of the
[2:02:40] Vatican but it's right
[2:02:45] here our thoughts against God are anti-
[2:02:50] good that's why as Believers we got to
[2:02:52] keep believing and believing and saying
[2:02:55] God I don't see it but I believe it
[2:02:57] right and if I can put it in your word
[2:03:00] and and these ministers can line it up
[2:03:02] with the message of the hour and we can
[2:03:04] have take the Bible and put it right
[2:03:06] like brother R said the two you know
[2:03:08] looking at the at the U
[2:03:10] sites then believe you that's the will
[2:03:12] of God and that's the that's we've
[2:03:14] discerned the perfect will of God
[2:03:17] right so now a couple more
[2:03:23] an example was Judas and
[2:03:25] Jesus here's Jesus he discerned that
[2:03:28] spirit because he's the son of man he
[2:03:30] knew
[2:03:31] that all the other 11 thought that Judas
[2:03:34] was just going to go out and buy buy
[2:03:36] some more food or pay for the food right
[2:03:39] cuz remember Jesus said go do what
[2:03:41] you're going to do he even said the one
[2:03:43] that stops a bowl in front of me is the
[2:03:44] one that's going to betray me and
[2:03:45] there's Judas sing in the
[2:03:48] bowl all 11 were de except for one man
[2:03:53] the son of man is the only man that
[2:03:55] wasn't deceived that's why the son of
[2:03:57] man in the end time has to come back to
[2:04:00] discern the very Mind Of God right you
[2:04:04] say oh we can't be right yeah we
[2:04:07] can if the word's right and we bring it
[2:04:11] right and we catch the mind of God right
[2:04:14] then the think can't be wrong now watch
[2:04:17] this Matthew 24:23 says then if any man
[2:04:20] shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or
[2:04:22] there believe it not oh pretty good now
[2:04:25] that that that person is acting like
[2:04:30] Christ to a degree
[2:04:32] might now this is in the seals all right
[2:04:35] Jesus is preaching the seals Matthew
[2:04:38] 24 for there shall arise false Christ
[2:04:41] and false prophets and shall show great
[2:04:44] signs and
[2:04:47] wonders well we're just sitting here
[2:04:49] dead as a door now trying to preach word
[2:04:51] of God best we can but boy they got they
[2:04:53] raising the dead over there well what do
[2:04:56] they believe well they're polygamy but
[2:04:57] that's okay that's all right you know
[2:04:59] they they believe in two Lords and they
[2:05:01] believe brother randam was God and well
[2:05:03] that's okay as long as they raised the
[2:05:07] dead people are going to flock to it
[2:05:11] folks they going to take the bait leave
[2:05:14] the hook
[2:05:16] right for there shall arise false Christ
[2:05:18] and false prophets and shall show great
[2:05:20] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[2:05:22] were possible they shall deceive the
[2:05:25] very elect behold I have told you before
[2:05:29] now this is Jesus wherefore if they
[2:05:31] shall say behold he's in the
[2:05:35] desert Tucson nothing against toon but
[2:05:39] that's a
[2:05:39] desert go not forth behold he's in the
[2:05:42] secret Chambers believe it
[2:05:46] not and I preached about this a long
[2:05:48] time ago do you know why you know where
[2:05:51] God's at where Christ
[2:05:54] is you know he's inside of you that's
[2:05:57] right I don't have to go to the desert
[2:06:00] to find
[2:06:03] Christ but what if I don't have Christ
[2:06:05] in me what if I am a foolish virgin what
[2:06:09] if I am been told that I got to go to
[2:06:10] the desert to listen to brother so and
[2:06:15] so Jesus said believe it not right now
[2:06:19] watch for as the lightning cometh out of
[2:06:21] the East East and shineth even into the
[2:06:22] West so shall also the coming of the son
[2:06:25] of man be nobody's going to know it but
[2:06:27] the son of man for wh soever the carcass
[2:06:30] is there will the Eagles be gathered
[2:06:34] together you will be deceived if you're
[2:06:37] not born again no doubt you're going to
[2:06:38] be deceived you are deceived if you're
[2:06:40] not born again that's
[2:06:42] right acts 9:4 and he fell to the Earth
[2:06:45] no I'm sorry this is um a question that
[2:06:48] um a sister gave me the and I didn't
[2:06:51] know the answer was this till till
[2:06:52] several years ago uh in Acts
[2:06:55] 9:4 remember Saul Saul was on his road
[2:06:58] to Damascus God knocked him off his
[2:07:01] horse maybe that's what we need and he
[2:07:03] fell to the Earth our high horse and he
[2:07:06] fell to the Earth and heard a voice
[2:07:07] saying un to him Saul Saul why
[2:07:09] persecutest thou me he said who art thou
[2:07:12] Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom
[2:07:14] thou persecutest it is hard for thee to
[2:07:17] kick against the
[2:07:19] Pricks now I didn't know this and until
[2:07:22] uh brother Jeff traml told me what this
[2:07:25] was and he's old enough to remember
[2:07:27] it but when you have an ox cart or when
[2:07:29] you have a donkey that's pulling a cart
[2:07:32] sometimes that donkey gets a little ill
[2:07:35] and he starts kicking the
[2:07:36] cart well down at the bottom there's a
[2:07:39] rod or iron
[2:07:41] go that sticks out at the bottom of it
[2:07:44] to when he kicks against a prick it
[2:07:47] kicks him it punctures his leg and he
[2:07:49] puts his foot down that's what he kept
[2:07:52] telling Paul he said Saul you keep
[2:07:54] kicking against the very thing that's
[2:07:56] trying to carry you you're kicking
[2:07:58] against the prick so that's what it is
[2:08:00] is an iron go for urging on ox and
[2:08:01] horses and another Beast of Burden hence
[2:08:03] the proverb to kicks against the go or
[2:08:06] to offer Vain and perilous or ruinous
[2:08:08] resist resistance in other words God
[2:08:10] said Saul I've been trying to work on
[2:08:12] you and you're just you're just kicking
[2:08:15] us the same place all the time so that's
[2:08:18] what kicking against the prick means
[2:08:21] anybody else
[2:08:22] have a statement on that but brother
[2:08:24] Jess trma he said yeah we used to have
[2:08:26] him out here see if when cuz he was like
[2:08:28] 80 something years old 20 years ago and
[2:08:31] uh he said yeah we used to have them
[2:08:33] said the old mu would start kicking
[2:08:35] backwards and he'd knock the whole card
[2:08:37] over he said you put a rod out there
[2:08:39] with a little um um sha um shave it like
[2:08:42] a pencil he said that thing kicks it one
[2:08:45] time and when he kicks inside that hoof
[2:08:46] he won't kick it no
[2:08:48] more so that's what God was saying Paul
[2:08:51] you're really hard-headed you need to if
[2:08:53] you kicked it one time and it pricked
[2:08:54] you you need to quit kicking it
[2:08:58] again all right Sarah marunga what does
[2:09:01] married to Christ
[2:09:03] mean Sarah's grown up look at her she is
[2:09:05] so grown
[2:09:06] up married to Christ means that you have
[2:09:10] the new
[2:09:13] birth that's pretty much the whole thing
[2:09:16] you can't be married to Christ and be
[2:09:18] married to the world you got to shun the
[2:09:20] world get rid of the world
[2:09:22] and to get married to Christ brother
[2:09:25] Brown said he puts on the wedding band
[2:09:27] of Grace unmar favor and you become his
[2:09:30] wife that's when you get born again when
[2:09:32] you get born again you become attached
[2:09:34] when I got married to June we became
[2:09:36] attached to each other all right so I
[2:09:39] was married to her she was married to me
[2:09:41] so when we get married to Christ that
[2:09:43] means we give him everything male and
[2:09:45] female we're all females in the body of
[2:09:48] Christ everybody with me Bride is a wife
[2:09:52] even though us strong males we're still
[2:09:54] feminist in the body of Christ so we
[2:09:57] have to lay our head over on
[2:10:01] Christ when we become his wife we give
[2:10:04] everything to him amen and that means
[2:10:07] your
[2:10:08] soul you give it all to him and then
[2:10:11] you're married there's a union so you
[2:10:13] and Christ can talk together not you and
[2:10:15] your mama or you and your dad you or
[2:10:17] your brother you and Christ it's an
[2:10:19] intimate relationship and and that's
[2:10:22] what happens when you get married right
[2:10:24] there's a relationship there well that's
[2:10:26] the same way with Christ but it's not in
[2:10:27] a carnal form it's in a spiritual form
[2:10:31] all right that okay to be married to
[2:10:33] Christ is to be born again you will be
[2:10:35] his bride
[2:10:38] um Sister Barbara can't be my bride
[2:10:41] because I'm not married to her I'm
[2:10:42] married to Sister June all right so
[2:10:44] we're coming together we we're coming
[2:10:46] together and making a marriage ceremony
[2:10:49] so when you get born again that's your
[2:10:50] marriage ceremony all right okay couple
[2:10:54] more and then we'll be
[2:11:01] done if you are uncertain about a
[2:11:03] personal issue and the scripture isn't
[2:11:05] clear on how to go about dealing with it
[2:11:07] do you reach out to your pastor
[2:11:10] yes absolutely or a
[2:11:13] minister or somebody with wisdom and
[2:11:15] somebody listen somebody you have
[2:11:17] confidence in CU if you can't get an
[2:11:19] answer for yourself
[2:11:22] then maybe you're either not going about
[2:11:23] it
[2:11:25] right
[2:11:31] yes right
[2:11:33] right that's why he's talking about
[2:11:36] judgment we shouldn't go out there and
[2:11:39] let them tell
[2:11:41] us like if say sister Bella goes and and
[2:11:44] um goes out there and and they say well
[2:11:47] you you can wear pants you what do you
[2:11:50] mean you
[2:11:51] no no I don't I don't
[2:11:54] because the Bible tells us that's a
[2:11:56] judgment against
[2:11:58] them everybody with me there's a
[2:12:00] judgment against them all right but
[2:12:02] they're trying to judge you and say
[2:12:03] you're wrong that's where you got to
[2:12:05] have discernment and judgment and it be
[2:12:09] the righteous judgment and have the
[2:12:11] righteous discernment to have the right
[2:12:13] discernment like sister Junes says if
[2:12:15] you've got a spiritual question you
[2:12:17] can't go ask a
[2:12:19] drunk what are you going to
[2:12:22] get
[2:12:24] right I mean really what are you going
[2:12:26] to get why would you why would you if
[2:12:28] you had a and I'm talking about a
[2:12:29] spiritual if you need a natural answer
[2:12:31] if you got parents go to them first is
[2:12:34] that
[2:12:35] right cuz brother R said your daddy was
[2:12:38] your Holy Ghost until you get the Holy
[2:12:39] Ghost amen or you marry somebody and you
[2:12:43] better both have the Holy
[2:12:44] Ghost so if you've got
[2:12:47] something a personal issue I'll be happy
[2:12:51] happy any of us um ministers uh to
[2:12:55] counsel with
[2:12:56] you to go about dealing with it but
[2:12:59] don't go out in the world and and listen
[2:13:01] counselors have a
[2:13:03] place everybody with me counselors have
[2:13:05] everybody's got a place right I don't
[2:13:07] say go to counseling but why would you
[2:13:10] go and listen to Somebody That was that
[2:13:12] has a totally different view than you do
[2:13:14] they're not born again they wear pants
[2:13:17] they they do all the things of the world
[2:13:19] and you need to get spiritual advice
[2:13:21] from them or they can help you with
[2:13:24] their
[2:13:26] Spirit you're
[2:13:28] deceived right right that's why the
[2:13:32] Bible says judge in here that's the same
[2:13:34] thing right judge in here if you've got
[2:13:36] a personal issue please come to me I'll
[2:13:38] talk to you anytime or uh like I said if
[2:13:41] you're a young child or anything I don't
[2:13:43] know who this is I can't the writing is
[2:13:45] got to be a female cuz I can read it um
[2:13:48] I couldn't read if it's a male but uh if
[2:13:51] if you have a an opportunity
[2:13:55] um if you have a parent go to them first
[2:14:00] but I mean if you're 30 years old and
[2:14:01] you got 50y old parents yeah well you're
[2:14:04] not married but listen there's a
[2:14:06] headship there you got to remember

[2:16:17] go in that room and shut the door with
[2:16:19] all right because it just keeps the
[2:16:23] devil at Bay
[2:16:25] right all right the church has gifts
[2:16:28] does that mean without the body of
[2:16:30] Believers that's gathered in the
[2:16:31] building are outside individuals hold on
[2:16:34] a minute I like brother Ram he brother
[2:16:37] BR one time he said hey can you read
[2:16:39] this can you read
[2:16:40] this the church has gifts period does
[2:16:45] that mean within the body of Believers
[2:16:47] that's gathered in oh okay I got it I
[2:16:48] got it see I'm like brother Brown say oh
[2:16:50] I got man got
[2:16:51] it I like one do you remember that when
[2:16:53] that brother random answered and the
[2:16:55] lady was definitely talking about
[2:16:57] nursing a baby I mean definitely talking
[2:17:01] about nursing the baby he said yeah it's
[2:17:03] good to nurse you need to go out to the
[2:17:04] hospitals and help people she was
[2:17:06] talking about nursing a
[2:17:08] baby it's in there somewhere you put he
[2:17:11] says oh yeah you it's really it's
[2:17:13] commendable that you want to go nurse he
[2:17:16] that that sister wasn't talking about
[2:17:18] that but that's okay that's a Humanity
[2:17:21] that we are that that uh um sometimes we
[2:17:24] discern
[2:17:25] wrong and we need we need everybody to
[2:17:28] discern right listen everybody has some
[2:17:32] sort of discernment in their life
[2:17:34] especially if you're a born again
[2:17:35] believer you have discernment to discern
[2:17:38] right from wrong listen listen you
[2:17:41] discerned in your soul that you were
[2:17:43] lost right that's the greatest thing
[2:17:45] that you knew you were
[2:17:47] lost and that you discerned that it
[2:17:49] wasn't the world that was going to save
[2:17:50] save you it was Jesus Christ that was
[2:17:52] going to save you all right then you
[2:17:54] come into the message and you
[2:17:57] said I can wear whatever I want to do I
[2:18:00] got to read the Bible and the Bible says
[2:18:02] do this and don't do that you got to
[2:18:04] discern right the church has gifts does
[2:18:08] that mean within the body of Believers
[2:18:09] that's gathered in the building or also
[2:18:11] outside
[2:18:13] individuals no well now there's
[2:18:16] gifts as the Bible says there's
[2:18:18] diversity of gifts
[2:18:20] there's people has gifts out in the
[2:18:23] world but they're not of
[2:18:26] God come on they're not of God you got
[2:18:30] these people that are that are um uh
[2:18:34] mediums and there are people that can
[2:18:36] help you out that does have a gift of
[2:18:38] wisdom but I'll promise you if they've
[2:18:40] never stepped over in the church they
[2:18:42] can't give you the right determination
[2:18:45] or the right discernment if they don't
[2:18:46] know anything about if you're talking
[2:18:48] about your spiritual life you can't go
[2:18:50] talk to to a prostitute about
[2:18:52] it that's pretty blunt but that's true
[2:18:56] why would you go well I'm going to go to
[2:18:57] a prostitute and ask him about my
[2:18:59] spiritual life no you need to ask him
[2:19:02] about their spiritual
[2:19:03] life that's right but you have a sister
[2:19:05] or a brother in the church or sisters
[2:19:07] and brothers in the church that have
[2:19:08] these nine spiritual gifts wisdom
[2:19:11] prophecy uh Faith all these different
[2:19:13] nine spiritual gifts go to them you're
[2:19:17] not going to hurt my feelings n right
[2:19:19] right but but now here's the whole
[2:19:23] thing like brother Dell's always
[2:19:26] said and brother Brown even says it
[2:19:29] too if somebody has a a question in the
[2:19:32] church all right now I don't mind if
[2:19:36] brother L got a question him and brother
[2:19:37] Bob get together they're
[2:19:39] ministers
[2:19:41] okay but if their decision that they
[2:19:44] come up with is different than what the
[2:19:46] pastor believes we got a problem right
[2:19:50] that's why brother Bram said pastor
[2:19:52] should be at every meeting between indiv
[2:19:55] between people in the church right why
[2:19:57] because sometimes we do get it wrong
[2:19:59] sometimes I get it
[2:20:01] wrong but we need to have that flow of
[2:20:03] information where what gets the church
[2:20:05] in in problem is is brother Donnie not
[2:20:08] just using you s you're biggest one in
[2:20:10] the place I'm going use you you and
[2:20:12] brother Anderson the next biggest person
[2:20:13] tallest person in the place y'all get
[2:20:16] together and say now now what brother
[2:20:18] wade mean when he said
[2:20:21] XYZ well I think he meant and I think he
[2:20:25] meant and I'm going to go talk to
[2:20:28] Brother Gary see what he thinks about
[2:20:31] what he meant well come to the man that
[2:20:33] said
[2:20:34] it and see what he meant that's right
[2:20:37] and if he can't tell you what he meant
[2:20:39] get rid of
[2:20:46] him that's why that you you shouldn't
[2:20:48] have secret meetings is that that's what
[2:20:50] brother Brown was talking about and even
[2:20:51] dad said the same thing you should never
[2:20:53] have a Deacon meeting you should never
[2:20:54] have a meeting between people and and
[2:20:56] discuss Doctrine as in what do you mean
[2:20:59] by this what do you mean by that no go
[2:21:02] to the go to the person that said it say
[2:21:04] hey what do you mean by
[2:21:06] this amen everybody good I didn't think
[2:21:09] we'd ever even get this at 4:30 but I I
[2:21:14] apologize but we got the questions
[2:21:16] answered if you got any more we'll do
[2:21:18] this maybe in um
