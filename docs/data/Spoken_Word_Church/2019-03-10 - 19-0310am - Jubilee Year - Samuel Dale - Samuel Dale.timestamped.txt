[4:42] testimony one time of how I was a lady
[4:47] she was an orphan and she couldn't
[4:49] understand why our parents gave her up
[4:51] and those kind of things and she came
[4:54] across a Bible and started to read in
[4:56] that verse 10 when my father and mother
[4:57] forsake me then the Lord will take me up
[5:00] that's what took her to Christ she gave
[5:03] her heart to Christ and she found her

[7:18] to Leviticus 25 we've been reading from
[7:24] try to bring the thought closer to the
[7:29] end today and move on a little bit this
[7:31] afternoon and I remember the fellowship
[7:34] meeting will be at brother Longoria's on

[7:43] that and brother Aaron will be

[7:50] view Wade last night in the Philippines
[7:53] of course we had a lot of you know third
[8:03] Saturday we got we'll get that part
[8:06] anyway but we got to view Wade last
[8:10] night and we got to buffer a lot so we
[8:12] got a lot of Steel pictures you know
[8:14] there's sometimes five minutes wait
[8:17] until they led work out and do but we
[8:20] did get to watch the service he's done a
[8:21] great job ministering on adoption the
[8:25] people seem to be overjoyed about the
[8:28] message in things and there's moving on
[8:30] and keep it going on and on so you know
[8:33] just print the Lord would bless him
[8:35] they're gonna be flying some gotta fly
[8:37] from one place to another and then fly
[8:39] back and then be some more services and
[8:42] also prayer to the Lord would bless him
[8:44] he was really moving pretty fast last
[8:46] night and I thought oh man if I tried to
[8:49] move out of way and holler I wouldn't
[8:52] have no voice after about two days and
[8:55] I'd be whispering but he can he can take
[8:58] it and make it work so just pray that
[9:00] the Lord would bless all right anything
[9:03] else
[9:06] eleven o'clock seven o'clock anybody
[9:10] wants to go we'll all try to get
[9:11] together do whatever we can work to do
[9:14] together
[9:15] you've already heard brother dicks doing
[9:17] better
[9:18] we appreciate God being with him and and
[9:21] everything taking care of him through
[9:23] that heart attack and all of the things
[9:26] that he did have a mild one and then
[9:29] they put some stents in they got to do
[9:31] some more later but just keep praying
[9:34] for him it's Lord would would make
[9:36] everything to be all right okay remember
[9:38] the others that are sick Holy Father we

[9:44] understanding your grace your guidance
[9:48] thank you for you we just ask you to
[9:50] Lord to help us to be what you want us
[9:54] to be because that's our desire more
[9:56] than anything else is to follow in your
[10:00] example your footprints your love and
[10:02] your grace and let it all Lord be for
[10:06] your honor and glory we read your word
[10:08] because we know that that word is true
[10:12] and we just ask you to open it so that
[10:16] we can see it we can read the words off
[10:18] the page but yet without the Holy Ghost
[10:20] in our hearts to reveal it it's worth
[10:23] nothing to us but we pray that you just
[10:26] got each one member weighed our ministry
[10:28] and the things traveling take care of
[10:30] him remember all this the ones here that
[10:32] are sick and just let your loving grace
[10:35] be there we love you and we thank you in
[10:38] Jesus name Amen
[10:40] I want to keep reading this until you
[10:46] get the thought of what we're trying to
[10:49] bring you know not just trying to talk
[10:53] about a date or a time or a season or
[10:55] anything we put a couple of services on
[10:58] 77 and it has been very well received on
[11:03] the internet because we've jumped by
[11:06] double connections for the amount of
[11:09] time so maybe somebody's listening and
[11:11] they can can hear and understand but we
[11:14] don't want to leave anything to her it
[11:17] would be dangling to where they wouldn't
[11:19] understand us so we try to express
[11:22] things in a way that will you know carry
[11:26] on
[11:27] and and be a benefit to each one like
[11:31] brother Brown said now these things it's
[11:32] very very uh you know for the hour and
[11:36] the time says the great significance to
[11:38] the people of this day because see if we
[11:43] see these things we can see Redemption I
[11:46] was listening to the message over a
[11:49] couple of times hour and a watching the
[11:51] point of layout see it to see redemption
[11:54] in the Old Testament is to just simply
[11:58] look at his word and read it there's no
[12:00] holy ghost Dyer to give you a new birth
[12:03] we know that but yet still all it was
[12:07] done and all was done and said for our
[12:09] honor and glory that they done that to
[12:13] where we could see what we need for this
[12:15] day so then that way we follow that and
[12:20] it leads out you know to the right way
[12:21] okay and the Lord spake unto Moses in
[12:24] mount sinai saying speak unto the
[12:26] children of Israel and say unto them
[12:28] when you come into the land which I give
[12:31] you then shall the land keep a Sabbath
[12:34] unto the Lord six years shall die so thy
[12:38] field and six years shall die prune thy
[12:41] vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof
[12:44] but in the seventh year shall be a
[12:46] Sabbath of rest unto the land a Sabbath
[12:50] for the Lord thou shalt neither sow thy
[12:53] field are pruned i vineyard they which
[12:56] growth of its own accord of the harvest
[12:59] I shall not reap remember how we was
[13:01] explaining you don't reap you because
[13:03] you're not to try to he's supposed to
[13:06] give you on the sixth double for the
[13:09] part to take care of the seventh so you
[13:11] don't when you come to the seventh you
[13:13] can't go out and reap and sell it or
[13:15] store it up you don't need to because
[13:17] God has given you what is needful to
[13:21] take care of it alright and the Sabbath
[13:25] of the land shall be meat to you for
[13:28] thee and for thy servant and for that
[13:30] maid and for the hired servant and for
[13:33] thy stranger and Sojourner so that
[13:36] sojourneth with thee and for thy cattle
[13:39] and for the beasts
[13:41] in the field shall all the increase
[13:43] there of the meat thou shalt number now
[13:47] watch it seven Sabbath's of years unto
[13:51] thee seven times seven years in a space
[13:55] of seven Sabbath's of years shall be
[13:57] unto thee forty and nine years then
[14:03] shalt thou cause the jubilee of the
[14:05] trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the
[14:07] tenth day of the seventh month in the
[14:10] day of atonement they even put it right
[14:13] to the date now so you make the trumpet
[14:16] sound throughout all your land and you
[14:18] shall hallow the fiftieth year and
[14:20] proclaim Liberty throughout all the land
[14:22] unto all the inhabitants thereof it
[14:26] shall be a jubilee unto you and you
[14:29] shall return every man unto his
[14:31] possession and you shall return every
[14:33] man unto his family and you may be
[14:36] seated the Lord had his blessing to the
[14:39] reading of the word now I know that
[14:43] maybe sometimes you get bored by me
[14:49] repeating myself you can count it for
[14:53] old age to do what you want to but I was
[14:56] repeating myself when I was thirty years
[14:58] old trying to preach as much as I
[15:01] probably more than I do now you know
[15:04] because that's been my point is to
[15:07] something repetitive you know eventually
[15:12] it will fall into your memory enough to
[15:15] be able to see what's going on all right
[15:19] see then you say well do we need this
[15:22] well let me ask you a question what you
[15:28] gonna do you gonna go home eat drink and
[15:32] be merry and just sit around wait oh we
[15:36] know the Lord's come in the allottee
[15:38] we're just glad you know but see that
[15:43] doesn't work we've been here for a
[15:46] reason we're here today for a reason all
[15:51] right everything's right on time the
[15:53] Prophet said there's nothing
[15:54] cater they don't look like it but we're
[15:59] here for that time but when you get into
[16:02] understanding your scriptures you can
[16:05] see we're here exactly to fulfill the
[16:07] Scriptures all right and then following
[16:11] that see then we can follow and see
[16:14] right where we're at and what we're
[16:17] doing in this day okay now we've been
[16:22] talking about you know not to to do
[16:27] anything but just you know some people
[16:29] say you're just packing that down on me
[16:31] cause you keep repeating it well if you
[16:33] say that then there's something wrong
[16:34] with you that's the best way to say it
[16:37] leave it to her all right
[16:41] most everybody when you talk about
[16:44] something that we read here of the
[16:46] Jubilee and you talk of a Jubilee to
[16:49] most religious people and and they'll
[16:52] say well the fiftieth that's the Jubilee
[16:54] the 50th oh yeah we got 250 with well
[16:58] alright that's well and good then you've
[17:02] got your fiftieth that's what it means
[17:06] what it means it goes to the number
[17:09] eight and occurs it over to eternity yes
[17:12] but now what are you going to type with
[17:18] in other words if you take the 50 and
[17:21] that's all you can follow through the
[17:23] Bible where she types and shadows
[17:26] because the 50 is not a type of anything
[17:29] just remember that one point the one
[17:32] little thing to think on the message if
[17:34] you don't get nothing there remember a
[17:36] 50 it's not a type the number 8 is not a
[17:40] type you're not typing this typing that
[17:46] thing there's there's no way you turn it
[17:51] to his eternity and you don't type with
[17:53] eternity what would you type you know
[17:58] are you listening what would you type if
[18:01] you tried to use the word eternity so
[18:04] then you totally annihilate the whole
[18:06] Old Testament
[18:08] right now listen I'm saying in you
[18:11] denial eight Matthew Mark Luke and John
[18:16] the Lord Jesus and his message because
[18:19] you today say I don't need that see
[18:24] that's where we it's so hard to try to
[18:26] comprehend some things maybe but you
[18:30] know just think on it you realize when
[18:33] the Lord Jesus was here he was under
[18:35] came under the law to redeem them that
[18:38] were under the law you know he kept the
[18:41] law you know he told him to go when he
[18:44] would heal them he tell him go show
[18:46] yourself to Moses or you know that I
[18:49] mean the the priests they'll show
[18:52] yourself as Moses had commanded the
[18:53] priesthood you know and he he was under
[18:58] the law until the day of Pentecost you
[19:04] know are the resurrection coming for his
[19:07] part all right
[19:09] see then he entered into the situation
[19:13] that could bring the interview but yet
[19:16] he spoke of the things that's what's so
[19:18] marvelous to me I don't understand I'm
[19:22] sorry
[19:23] maybe I expect too much or something I
[19:25] don't know but I thought we were
[19:27] supposed to be Bible readers you know I
[19:30] thought we had our emphasis upon the
[19:35] Word of God you know I thought the
[19:38] message was I had brought that to our
[19:42] understanding that we valued the word
[19:47] above where we were reading it before
[19:50] when we read it before we were reading
[19:53] it to maybe get a gold star maybe to
[19:57] show how many times we can say we've
[19:59] read the Bible some kind of a selfish
[20:02] motive to me I read the Bible but then
[20:11] when coming into the message and hearing
[20:14] the Prophet expound upon that word then
[20:20] the Bible itself
[20:21] become alive I thought that's what the
[20:27] message was to do I thought that's what
[20:29] the profit came to do was to bring us to
[20:33] a place to see the alive word living in
[20:37] us that's why I emphasized so much that
[20:42] we live in a present tense we don't live
[20:47] in the pies we don't live in the future
[20:48] we live in the present tense now listen
[20:52] to what I'm saying you may not agree
[20:53] with this but you know that the basics
[20:55] of most religion either lives in the
[20:57] past or the future I mean you just
[21:03] consider their thoughts and their doings
[21:06] and everything and they living that in
[21:08] the Pais to the future all right but see
[21:12] we're supposed to be present tense
[21:15] eternal life so there was the whole Old
[21:19] Testament as tops and shadows okay then
[21:24] the Lord Jesus come and look how
[21:27] marvelous it marvelous it was go you say
[21:30] to most people you know they turned to
[21:32] the first book of the New Testament
[21:34] where were you gonna turn we return to
[21:36] Matthew that's not the first book of the
[21:39] New Testament New Testament wasn't in in
[21:46] making at the time of Matthew or now it
[21:50] was but time he wrote it down but you
[21:52] know what I'm saying
[21:53] the things that were spoke of in Matthew
[21:55] Mark Luke and John even the master
[21:58] himself was still under the law he had
[22:01] to come according to the law he couldn't
[22:03] break that law he couldn't do that
[22:08] because he was the word himself all
[22:11] right see then he had to come to bring
[22:15] it to a place that you could move it
[22:18] from tops and shadows toward a reality
[22:21] now within him within the being we call
[22:26] Jesus was eternal life right
[22:32] that was the
[22:34] the thing that you know did you talk
[22:37] about to be the 50 or the eight of
[22:41] eternity he already had that he didn't
[22:44] have to receive that he was that see
[22:51] then he stands between the Old Testament
[22:54] and the New Testament and see then the
[22:59] first book of the New Testament is what
[23:01] the book of Acts
[23:03] kotas the Holy Ghost in the church and
[23:07] the Holy Ghost in the church you're
[23:10] you're not under the law Christ is the
[23:13] end of the law for righteousness to them
[23:16] that believe all right see then those
[23:19] types and shadows back there they had to
[23:22] be there for our understanding and like
[23:27] I said the Prophet is read he said these
[23:29] things have a great significance for us
[23:32] down here in the end time why because
[23:36] we're supposed to be the people that the
[23:38] end of all things has come upon all
[23:40] right we're not down to the age of just
[23:44] trying to learn this study that do this
[23:47] that or the other we're at the age of
[23:49] trying to get to be a reality into our
[23:53] hearts and lives all right and see then
[23:55] it may sound odd to keep doing but yet
[23:58] here comes a prophet and he's preaching
[24:01] and he brings these things out for us
[24:06] the Lord Jesus kept those Sabbath's
[24:10] he kept those things in times he lived
[24:17] according to what they had he went to
[24:19] church on the day that they went to
[24:21] church he done the things that they was
[24:26] to do or not do on the Sabbath but it
[24:30] was what it was the seventh day all
[24:35] right
[24:36] it was not any
[24:38] turn at that time it was a seventh day
[24:39] so in that Old Testament when you're
[24:42] reading that God works six days and
[24:44] rested the seventh they read Paul and
[24:49] his studies of that and you can look
[24:52] back and see what took place all right
[24:56] see those things then were for our being
[24:58] to to bring us to a place that we could
[25:02] understand the you maybe you don't pay
[25:09] attention to or or think about it
[25:11] as I do in the basis of how perfect the
[25:15] Word of God is it is so beautiful to
[25:19] read it and to realize what it's talking
[25:22] about
[25:23] and the thing we can understand it you
[25:29] know what I'm talking about we were we
[25:31] were back there a lot of us biggest
[25:33] portion of us back in organized religion
[25:35] we had no concept or thoughts of a
[25:37] living God in a reality and of right our
[25:41] president oh yeah we believed he was a
[25:43] healer we believe that you were Savior
[25:45] we believe these things but did we
[25:47] believe in a reality of Christ living to
[25:51] fulfill the god of the word well who did
[25:57] you serve back there I've done the best
[26:00] of service I could the god that I
[26:02] believed in but yet coming into the
[26:06] message then that God I've told you
[26:09] things I've seen God things that happen
[26:12] I wanted to see God I wanted to see that
[26:16] God that I read of in the word that I
[26:19] looked around and could not find and we
[26:24] were doing good I mean you know things
[26:26] were happening but yet see one day when
[26:31] a prophet begin to speak and I heard him
[26:36] talking about the word so simple that I
[26:39] could understand it all at once
[26:42] something started changing and I wasn't
[26:45] even born again so don't don't go say
[26:47] what I got morning in it that's
[26:48] wonderful I wasn't
[26:51] we get to Bible become alive to me as I
[26:56] begin to read and see how this
[26:58] represents this and this represents this
[27:03] scent and listen to that prophet until
[27:05] it was just you know just amazing to
[27:09] hear him speak of the simplicity of the
[27:13] things that we couldn't figure out yet
[27:18] he would bring it out so simple until I
[27:21] could understand it it made the word
[27:25] come from letters on the page to reality
[27:29] in a human being at least I could see
[27:33] one time I could know there was one man
[27:36] could understand might not have been
[27:39] made might not pass tellers but I knew
[27:41] one thing for sure this man understood
[27:44] what he's talking about and he talked to
[27:47] the God that I wanted to see he talked
[27:55] of a God that I wanted to you know to
[27:59] come to some relationship as you'd call
[28:02] it with he spoke of the new birth so
[28:06] simple until it was just amazing yet it
[28:13] was exactly what the Bible had said he
[28:17] didn't come to change it to make it work
[28:20] he come to get us to see it at her
[28:22] already said it alright see then you've
[28:27] got to have your tops in your shadows
[28:29] but remember in your tops in your
[28:31] shadows be careful don't just lay it
[28:35] down oh that's just the type of son
[28:37] it has great meanings to it when the day
[28:42] of Pentecost was fully come you realize
[28:45] the Holy Ghost couldn't come before them
[28:47] I mean a year before the end they had a
[28:53] Jew police they had times they had side
[28:56] Bush they had all kind of things they
[28:58] work six years arrested itself right but
[29:04] still they never could come to a reality
[29:08] of something within their heart not they
[29:15] never could come to a rest that they
[29:19] knew it was spoke up then is knowing
[29:25] that then you can see that those things
[29:28] back there
[29:29] they had a meaning to you and me they
[29:34] were done a certain way to be for us you
[29:40] know and said their lies not listening
[29:43] to wait ministering and this mind
[29:45] running back into the Bible and in
[29:47] thinking about it you know of what he
[29:50] was talking about in at once part of
[29:51] talking about that God is a moving God
[29:53] you know he never stops he's never steal
[29:57] he's moving
[29:58] because that's really the understanding
[30:00] of life is a constant moving not
[30:05] necessarily moving this way but a
[30:07] constant you know movement our
[30:10] advancement and I would my mind was
[30:13] going back into the Old Testament when
[30:15] it would go back there and I'd see those
[30:16] children of Israel as they journeyed and
[30:19] went through and a setting like this you
[30:21] know I was tied up into that while he
[30:23] was preaching and thinking about you
[30:25] know that in Ezekiel when he saw the
[30:27] wheel in the middle of the wheel and he
[30:29] saw the children of Israel in journey
[30:32] well yet it was shown in as an example
[30:34] of a wheel running in the middle of a
[30:36] wheel you know a movement as your
[30:41] religion died on you because if it ever
[30:44] stops it will there's no such thing in
[30:47] God is standing still there is no such
[30:50] thing you said well brother I've been
[30:52] having trouble I'm just standing still
[30:53] now no your back slid just admit it your
[30:58] back slid because you stopped if you
[31:00] stopped God's moving on you want to
[31:03] quote from brother Branham work that
[31:05] Martin Luther called the pillar of fire
[31:07] and he said he moved on well you know
[31:09] when they begin to die down and
[31:11] everything brother Brennan would say and
[31:12] Wesley caught that pillar of fire in a
[31:15] way he went
[31:16] God has always been in
[31:18] movement form it's never just a standing
[31:22] still alright then think about the
[31:28] opening of God's Word as it constantly
[31:31] unveils and you'll see what I'm trying
[31:35] to describe of a god that's reality of
[31:38] life and moving the revelation never
[31:42] stops whether you get to the afternoon
[31:46] services and in this thing see it never
[31:51] stops it's the constant movement
[31:55] it never ends is it going to end we have
[32:04] three sons name right sort of man son of
[32:08] God son of David alright son of David
[32:11] isn't is the throne in the Millennium
[32:13] right Jesus sits on the throne is that
[32:16] the end of it does that end it all no
[32:27] it's
[32:29] makes ready for the future home our
[32:33] eternity because the millennium has not
[32:37] Eterne at this time it's a thousand
[32:41] years but then you come to so what are
[32:46] you going to go with our with you know
[32:49] what are you gonna take son of God
[32:51] son of man son of God son of David
[32:56] there's a lot more to the Word of God
[32:58] than just to take statements like that
[33:01] and say well I see it we got it son of
[33:03] God a son of man
[33:04] Becker son of God we understand that now
[33:06] and in the Millennium be son of David or
[33:09] does it go from there it's got to be in
[33:15] the Bible it's got to be in the prophets
[33:19] message where do we go from dire is
[33:22] there another son's night to come into
[33:27] be it's a constant moving it never ends
[33:37] we go I love the wording when I read
[33:40] that - probably he said that God would
[33:43] give us a message of cheer down through
[33:46] the endless ages after life is over
[33:49] after all of these things after the
[33:52] Millennium and you enter the future home
[33:55] are you gonna enter the future home and
[33:57] just stop learning
[33:59] oh we just come to an end as far as we
[34:04] can go to give you an example I was
[34:10] thinking or something the other day this
[34:12] is funny Carla carnal but I thank him
[34:17] you know the world's getting pretty
[34:19] crowded
[34:21] seven billion people now you go to some
[34:24] of these countries and and they just
[34:26] living on top of each other just stacked
[34:28] up almost you know and I mean you just
[34:30] bumping into pushing and shoving and
[34:32] going and then even a little bit I've
[34:36] been you you realize that that they're
[34:38] just masses of people
[34:41] you know well when you get to the future
[34:45] home we got seven billion now you get to
[34:52] the future home how many people are you
[34:53] gonna have what if you just have the
[34:57] seven billion what if he's just out
[35:02] seven billion it's still gonna be
[35:05] crowded you understand him it's gonna be
[35:10] crowded see we don't think about here
[35:14] when we're getting the car and drive 80
[35:15] miles to get to go to a grocery store or
[35:17] something yeah I mean at least 15 miles
[35:19] or something with these going to Atlanta
[35:21] downtown you'd have to drive we don't
[35:23] think we don't think about you go
[35:25] overseas until you just packed up on one
[35:28] another I was thinking about that I
[35:32] thought Lord what's gonna happen you
[35:41] know what this is the thought that came
[35:42] to him in so you say is Carla's crazy
[35:45] you know we talked about the Big Bang
[35:47] Theory of the creation all right
[35:51] everything flung off the Sun that it's
[35:56] just Bly stood out and you know
[35:59] particles are metal or whatever you want
[36:03] to call different things that went in
[36:05] ever direction and you got this planets
[36:08] beyond planets beyond planets and and
[36:10] you got places out there that that
[36:13] there's so big until you could put a
[36:19] half a dozen Earth's on that one chunk
[36:22] of metal or whatever floating around I
[36:27] think you know what if God just called
[36:31] it all back not back to the burning Sun
[36:35] the only gonna go carnal what did he
[36:38] just call back all those planets and put
[36:45] them back together you know you're
[36:49] saying
[36:49] your kids you come through you study
[36:51] didn't and a lot of those planets out
[36:53] there that are way under bigger than we
[36:54] are
[36:55] what if you brought them all back
[36:57] together you don't have to worry about
[37:02] how many people they'll be there right
[37:04] you understand my point you don't have
[37:06] to worry about how many people is gonna
[37:07] be there
[37:08] cuz he can bring it all back together
[37:10] and have millions of worlds called you
[37:14] know as we go out through space we're
[37:15] finding out that it's just beyond our it
[37:18] just keeps on going to all kinds of
[37:20] planets and and different things you
[37:23] know you just put all that back together
[37:26] you have a big old flight I'm charging
[37:29] them for that what I'm just thinking
[37:30] that that's our coronal I think cuz I
[37:33] really I I like to think things over and
[37:37] I do I like to just think about things
[37:39] as it is it's unveil to me and that's
[37:44] why I guess maybe that I spend so much
[37:45] time to you know trying to get you to
[37:49] see it and help us to understand alright
[37:53] now let's go see then we read here in
[37:57] Leviticus that there's a Sabbath every
[38:03] seven years
[38:05] all right there's a Jubilee never seven
[38:10] years but you believe is a release right
[38:17] so then ever seven years you had a
[38:21] release and you went seven seven seven
[38:30] seven - do you come to seven times that
[38:33] and you come to a 49 all right the next
[38:38] is a fifty well we say well well the
[38:42] fifties the Jubilee now you don't have
[38:46] 7g believes to get to a fifty no matter
[38:53] how you try to calculate that turning
[38:55] over to a fifty or turning over to the
[38:58] first one back or are the eight you know
[39:00] being than one and the things like that
[39:02] remember all that is is for
[39:05] understanding to see how mathematically
[39:09] correct everything is alright but you
[39:16] can't argue the point because we went
[39:18] through the Bible in the you know in
[39:19] Exodus and Deuteronomy 's and the things
[39:21] like that showing it and gave where the
[39:24] Prophet was covering that there was a
[39:26] Jubilee ever seven years there was
[39:32] arrests ever seven years we went through
[39:37] that there was arrest on like a Sabbath
[39:39] because that comes from the old day the
[39:42] Millennium the Prophet said God's going
[39:46] to have a millennium to show the sin
[39:48] curse is gone because the sin curse we
[39:53] fell in the seventh day right God worked
[39:58] six days rest in the seventh we fell in
[40:01] the rest all right
[40:04] we didn't fall in the eighth cuz ain't
[40:06] no way of falling from an eight because
[40:08] that's eternity all right you got your
[40:11] Sabbath you rest okay
[40:15] so then you dressed every seventh day
[40:18] you dressed every seventh year all right
[40:22] and then you'd have a marvelous
[40:26] situation facing you that you got to
[40:30] rest for each seven years you know and
[40:35] like I said you take a person and
[40:37] they're going to bondage to you and at
[40:41] the end of that period of time that
[40:45] brother is going to let you go free
[40:50] but he's not gonna send you out
[40:52] empty-handed I wish we could follow it
[40:57] like that it's not just the coming up of
[41:01] time you know and slavery's and things
[41:04] it's an example of slavery now let me
[41:10] ask you a simple question
[41:15] when Israel was in bondage to Egypt
[41:18] making bricks now I'm asking you a
[41:23] simple question to be this plain
[41:26] language when they were in bondage to
[41:32] Egypt did they rest the Sabbath day
[41:38] did you take the Sabbath day off
[41:45] did they give a rest of over seven years
[41:48] now they were all in bondage
[41:50] are you listening this district courts
[41:52] I'm trying to make you didn't have a
[41:57] jubilee for it's not that way it's from
[41:59] the brother buys a brother or a Hebrew
[42:02] buys a Hebrew it's not because they were
[42:08] in bondage to Egypt now wouldn't it be
[42:13] something if you walked up to fight Rome
[42:14] says we ain't working on the seventh day
[42:17] he said I guess you're right you're not
[42:23] gonna work on the seventh day because
[42:24] you ain't gonna be alive now you
[42:28] understand what I'm saying
[42:30] wouldn't that be plainly what he'd say
[42:32] because you ain't gonna be alive
[42:36] somebody's gonna be out there making
[42:38] bridge they didn't make brick six days
[42:40] and take a day off they have done that
[42:44] to start with because when they first
[42:46] started with the children of Israel and
[42:48] Egypt they were not in bondage there
[42:52] were free people Pharaoh had made them
[42:55] free with when Pharaoh passed on then
[42:59] they started the bondage situation
[43:01] Israel wasn't down there 400 years in
[43:04] bondage there were there a couple of
[43:07] hundred years as victorious people
[43:11] living in a wonderful land and being
[43:14] wealth out of right did you see you
[43:20] can't just put everything and say well
[43:22] that West no you've got to find it with
[43:25] the Prophet and let him tell you what it
[43:28] is
[43:31] see because he tells us in the Bible all
[43:35] right now if he's telling us correctly
[43:40] then there's a jubilee though it would
[43:44] fall over seven years and when you would
[43:48] do you would let go free like I said we
[43:54] want to make it this way I wish you'd
[43:56] listen to that message over again of
[43:57] life Sunday
[43:58] I mean I'm honest I wish you would
[44:00] because I put so much in depth into it
[44:03] of the statements that you really let's
[44:05] listen to it ain't bragging on my own
[44:08] himself I'm just telling the truth I
[44:09] wish you'd listen to it and just sit
[44:12] down and listen sensitively to the
[44:15] things that I was trying to cover of the
[44:18] the different points that it's
[44:24] Redemption like I said I go to brother
[44:30] Colley he's my brother I said brother I
[44:32] owe you money but I can't pay you so
[44:36] I'll go into bondage to you to work for
[44:39] you to pay that back well he's my
[44:43] brother he understands upfront what's
[44:45] going on and he knows that I'm gonna
[44:50] work six years but in the seventh I'm
[44:54] going free because that's I want you to
[44:57] get that in a minute we're brother and
[44:59] said this is the law of God these things
[45:03] that I'm talking about is the law not
[45:05] just outs of mankind God set down the
[45:09] law
[45:14] we'll see when they come around remember
[45:16] how he's expressing it when it come
[45:18] around to my six years and I go to
[45:21] brother Colley nusrah probably call him
[45:24] I've worked hard in the hope of being
[45:27] able to happen to do and work for you
[45:30] I've tried now the seventh is the rest
[45:34] and I'm going home
[45:36] and he says okay then we read the Bible
[45:40] to show it he said okay what you have
[45:43] need of I'll give it to you back in the
[45:48] Old Testament I'll give you enough to
[45:52] take care of you they didn't just throw
[45:56] him out here Cohen says yeah but I don't
[45:59] think you paid me enough no listen this
[46:05] one over here he's only paid $2,000 back
[46:09] on his bill and you owe me 10 it ain't
[46:15] nothing we will do with it he goes free
[46:20] at the end of that time all right and it
[46:25] goes down to where each one of those
[46:27] represents that freedom that release but
[46:31] he has to give you we read the Bible he
[46:33] has to give you enough to live off of
[46:38] until you get started
[46:42] my lord our government is better off and
[46:45] we are they ended the war what they do I
[46:48] know what never did go completely
[46:49] through but and no but it worked for
[46:52] some of it but you know what they don't
[46:54] at the end of the war here America they
[47:01] made a decree that they give the man so
[47:04] much money and AM you ever studied your
[47:08] history I gave them especially the mule
[47:14] and so many hundred dollars that ever
[47:18] personal folks get now we know they
[47:19] didn't get it cause it didn't work but I
[47:21] still I'm trying to what I'm trying to
[47:23] say is the government greater than we
[47:25] are
[47:25] does they handle food stamps and at
[47:29] least give them to people to where they
[47:30] can go in and get them some food but yet
[47:33] we just hoard everything to ourselves
[47:35] and no we read it to you there the Bible
[47:40] said that they may not know poor among
[47:42] you and said remember you were a
[47:45] bondsman you were in bondage in Egypt
[47:49] so you remember that see those things
[47:53] all mean something
[47:56] they mean a it's talking about a release
[47:59] a time to let go and everything and I
[48:02] read you where the Prophet said they
[48:03] went out totally and the Bible said -
[48:05] they went out didn't or dime didn't have
[48:08] to pay nothing it doesn't matter what
[48:14] you owed you went out free when the
[48:17] Jubilee was sounded but then we also
[48:21] read that there were certain things
[48:22] under the seventh that if you go into
[48:26] bondage with a wife when we read it
[48:28] right out of the scripture when you
[48:31] release comes you wife those wait but if
[48:33] for your master you went in didn't have
[48:35] a wife your master gives you a while and
[48:37] you have children the Bible plainly
[48:40] tells you the wife and the children
[48:43] don't go free did you I mean you're at
[48:49] least folks read it off the screen
[48:50] whether you can tell me I don't know
[48:51] where I believe that or not well maybe
[48:54] you're not red enough Bible but it was
[48:57] right there on the screen that's one
[48:58] thing I do is I put up there for you to
[49:01] read it now you're gonna argue with God
[49:04] about what said but what about all of
[49:09] those things is examples because the 7/7
[49:15] is 49
[49:16] there's no aid involved there's no fifty
[49:22] involved it's the Jubilee it's a release
[49:29] all right then you come to the fiftieth
[49:32] sure then everything goes free Leviticus
[49:35] 25:10
[49:36] everything goes free with the Prophet
[49:41] when he went to it he went into the
[49:43] Jubilees and the thing and he brought it
[49:45] right down to Leviticus 25 8 was he
[49:49] seven sevens or 49 and the 49s didn't
[49:53] remember we gave it to you
[49:55] the forty-nine offer them of the Feast
[49:58] of the trumpets the forty-nine
[50:00] represents the church ages
[50:03] you had seven Church ages you know if
[50:08] you think God ain't so perfect on what
[50:10] he does and I was riding through Israel
[50:14] and brother George Smith knew you know
[50:17] he knew it would throw me for a loop so
[50:19] he warned me a little ahead of time he
[50:21] said brother Dale George he said how
[50:26] many church ages are they you know I
[50:31] knew doing something so I went alone I
[50:34] said there's seven Church ages he said
[50:39] well how many candlesticks are they I
[50:44] said well there's seven golden
[50:48] candlesticks
[50:51] he said we're fixing to pice the House
[50:55] and Senate of Israel I'm driving down
[50:59] the bus he said would you mind counting
[51:02] over that House and Senate and tell me
[51:05] how many candlesticks they are and I
[51:09] looked out that window and I went one
[51:11] two three four five six seven eight nine
[51:14] I said brother George we got a problem
[51:27] what is it we got too many candlesticks
[51:34] see what would they use seven golden
[51:37] candlesticks and one of Israel used
[51:41] their menorah of why do you pronounce
[51:42] that word which is meaning for the
[51:44] candlestick they use it and get on all
[51:48] the things that others they have the
[51:49] sevens that out this they have all kind
[51:51] of thing so I'm curious we got stopped
[51:56] you know everywhere was going when I
[52:00] took off the Reuben which was the God
[52:03] and he was smart guy I'd love to bring
[52:07] him here sometimes and let him just
[52:09] speak for about a week to us about
[52:11] Israel in the think he's very smart
[52:15] I said Ruben you got to explain
[52:17] something to me he said what is it Sam I
[52:21] said you got too many candlesticks over
[52:25] the House and Senate
[52:26] I said cause in the Bible it's only
[52:29] seven he said you know what he said we
[52:36] don't understand why he said we believe
[52:42] the seven candlesticks represents the
[52:48] creation because they believe in a
[52:49] seven-day career they don't believe six
[52:51] days and rest is just ever they don't
[52:52] even go that way they believe in and
[52:55] this is why they stated seven-day
[52:57] creation seven-day creation anything you
[53:00] say to him he'd say that was the
[53:02] seven-day creation all right I said all
[53:07] right I can follow you and then how come
[53:11] you got nine over your house that's in
[53:12] it some of you heard this right you know
[53:16] what I'm saying
[53:17] he said well we do believe that one of
[53:21] those others out of the you know four
[53:24] seven and then we leave one of those
[53:27] represents God he said that's the best I
[53:31] can tell you I said well what's the
[53:34] other one
[53:35] he said don't know I you know I just
[53:42] simply asked him a question I said well
[53:44] if if that one that represents God could
[53:49] it be that the other one to make it out
[53:51] to nine would represent the person who's
[53:53] worshipping God hmm could be you know
[53:59] what you see even he had no answer why
[54:02] they had that nine candlestick sitting
[54:07] over the House and Senate that's bigger
[54:09] than you might gone on signs I leaned in
[54:11] great big old thing up over the top is
[54:13] big is this building crossways and great
[54:15] at way up there
[54:16] it was the menorah I see you talk to me
[54:22] ain't nothing but seven golden counter
[54:24] station what's brother Dale trying to do
[54:28] do you want to ride over and look at it
[54:30] if you don't take your phone right now
[54:32] turn it on top in menorah then you're
[54:38] gonna find
[54:38] they tell have a nine candlestick I
[54:44] don't know what that means I just go by
[54:46] the 7 because we know where the 7 church
[54:48] ages in sign letter Brennan said there
[54:50] was 7 Church ages in Old Testament right
[54:53] he said there's 7 search agent in New
[54:55] Testament now you can pick up one or two
[54:57] of those in the Old Testament and and
[54:59] like it was a shouting down by the walls
[55:04] and by the river when they crossed and
[55:08] you call it Pentecostal you can call
[55:10] this out of the other but I've never
[55:11] found one round explained the seven
[55:15] churches in the Old Testament as to
[55:18] explain his age but I believe it was a
[55:23] seven church ages in New Testament all
[55:26] right
[55:27] but in those sevens you remember listen
[55:31] if you don't get nothing out of the
[55:32] message listen to one point if you're
[55:35] still using a number and you go up to a
[55:39] number seven and you stop coach number
[55:42] seven is complete right and when you
[55:47] come up to seven
[55:48] you're not eternal that's why the
[55:52] Millennium is the seventh day and
[55:55] brother Branham said it would come in to
[55:58] show the sin curse because God works six
[56:02] days rested the seventh we fell in the
[56:04] rest and said we'll come back to a
[56:08] millennial reign for the world and all
[56:10] the things because that millennial reign
[56:12] will be the seventh day he said out of
[56:15] Eden that's what it represents but
[56:20] remember it's the seven and laying it's
[56:23] for the season see it's not an eight
[56:27] David sitting on the throne is under a
[56:29] seven we got a lot of Bible to go
[56:38] but think about it now what Rena says on
[56:44] the message Jubilee
[56:45] but then ever seven years it was the law
[56:49] of God that there was a Jubilee year and
[56:52] when the Jubilee year come by then the
[56:55] priest rode through the land sounding
[56:58] the trumpet telling you you could go
[57:01] free alright now seven sevens is the
[57:09] seven represents your seven seven
[57:11] forty-nine represents your seven Church
[57:13] ages we gave you that out of feast of
[57:15] the trumpet
[57:16] okay now that rest time each church age
[57:24] had arrest these church eggs how did you
[57:27] believe because these church age had a
[57:30] message these church age had a messenger
[57:33] that rode the land to declare Liberty to
[57:38] the people right so you seven salvage
[57:44] the seven day rest your release
[57:46] represented the church ages and in the
[57:50] east church' hu had to release these
[57:54] Church age had the baptism of the Holy
[57:56] Ghost all right
[58:00] but there was no release there there was
[58:05] no rapture there was no change in the
[58:07] body
[58:09] it was eternal life in the soul right of
[58:20] what a wonderful thing that have always
[58:22] tried to get you to see and though you
[58:26] get tired maybes means an example in
[58:28] things but that's the best I can do you
[58:35] realize this 7th church age was a
[58:37] special one a special age and that
[58:47] without us could not be made perfect all
[58:50] the other ages is dead and in the grave
[58:53] this is the only age if the people are
[58:56] alive in this seventh age is most
[59:02] marvellous thing those seven sevens is
[59:07] 49 a messenger to each church age okay a
[59:12] release to Easter eggs are you listening
[59:14] a release to each church age is a type
[59:17] of example of the 7-year release the
[59:19] rest they had all right but nobody made
[59:23] it to the 50 they made it to the 50 in
[59:28] the soul in the new birth but they never
[59:33] made it to a 50 to come to a change of
[59:35] the body or a rapture or anything like
[59:38] that and you just think I know we have
[59:47] discussions we've had it about this and
[59:49] that the other about it because it's
[59:51] hard to calculate those things and to
[59:53] keep it in the right order when you try
[59:55] to talk about 250 a lot of people says
[59:57] you don't have a 50 that you just make
[1:00:02] the circle back to the first and go back
[1:00:05] again you're right but you're not all
[1:00:09] right because it's got to come one day
[1:00:13] to a 50 it can't keep on going back to a
[1:00:19] 1 you go back to a 1 it just puts you
[1:00:21] back in you're still in time it's long
[1:00:23] you're making that circle 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
[1:00:26] 1 2 3 go for you're in time the future
[1:00:30] home is not future home is an 8 or a 50
[1:00:37] it's right to think about that there is
[1:00:41] no eighth day that's true but then you
[1:00:48] got to go to the profit in the future
[1:00:49] home and he found an eighth day
[1:00:55] it doesn't change in your thoughts if
[1:00:58] you get it correctly the one two three
[1:01:02] four five six seven one two three is a
[1:01:04] type of eternal life well one day they
[1:01:13] will be one day they will be a 50th
[1:01:18] Jubilee for the world and mankind and
[1:01:23] that's the future home you got to come
[1:01:26] under a night to get to that place
[1:01:27] alright not worried about trying to get
[1:01:32] this one two three four five six not
[1:01:33] worried about trying to get that into
[1:01:35] place it's the point of getting what
[1:01:39] you're talking about
[1:01:45] see I asked the question years ago and
[1:01:48] preached on it many times many church
[1:01:50] age is already seven right and winning
[1:01:57] church age messengers are they
[1:02:05] but some of you've been around here long
[1:02:06] enough to order know what I'm talking
[1:02:07] about you got to have eight to come into
[1:02:16] view they have not you gonna wind up in
[1:02:24] the wrong one
[1:02:25] yeah but brother branham we look at the
[1:02:28] picture and we see brother Branham in
[1:02:31] the seventh search aid was he here or
[1:02:33] here which one was he was he at the
[1:02:41] beginning of lady ousia
[1:02:43] or did he come into being at the ending
[1:02:45] of Lady of SIA
[1:02:46] every search agent masik your advert
[1:02:48] search agent imagine hear you properly
[1:02:50] said comes to the end of the age
[1:02:57] everyone has to now listen this what
[1:03:03] happened in this age it's what I said
[1:03:06] this ages are most marvelous of all
[1:03:11] because in this age the Holy Ghost came
[1:03:14] himself
[1:03:18] that's not my words that's the words of
[1:03:22] your prophet no messenger and way off my
[1:03:26] nose no messenger to the age that's why
[1:03:35] it took a prophetic prophet to come the
[1:03:39] messenger to the age because the Holy
[1:03:41] Ghost came himself in his fullness of
[1:03:44] the baptism but in the end of the age
[1:03:48] and it always ends upon the others we
[1:03:52] find our than the messenger sent and all
[1:03:55] of these scruples and things are to be
[1:03:57] placed
[1:03:59] did brother Branham come as to be the
[1:04:02] messenger of Lady osya
[1:04:03] or did he come to be the messenger to
[1:04:06] the bride in the end time to take her
[1:04:08] from time to eternity
[1:04:10] now which way well you're making two men
[1:04:14] messengers oh so you're not gonna listen
[1:04:22] to what the Prophet says because you got
[1:04:25] your mind made up but still what are you
[1:04:29] gonna do with it well brother Branham
[1:04:32] says in the church in the seal book I
[1:04:35] didn't give this to him progress 72
[1:04:45] talking about the Pentecostal age with
[1:04:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:04:48] cabbage down on that and there cannot be
[1:04:51] no more ages that's all of it that's the
[1:04:54] Philadelphia are not the lady of C&H but
[1:04:57] then we found in study of the scripture
[1:04:59] that's a messenger to the age come right
[1:05:01] at the end of the age every time Paul
[1:05:04] come at the end of the age we find out
[1:05:07] Iranians come at the end of the age
[1:05:09] Martin into the age Luther into the
[1:05:16] Catholic age and what Wesley at the end
[1:05:25] of the Lutheran age and Pentecost at the
[1:05:31] end of the age of sanctification through
[1:05:34] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and at the
[1:05:36] end of the Pentecostal age we're
[1:05:38] supposed to receive according to the
[1:05:40] Word of God help us to not to show
[1:05:42] either that we were to receive a
[1:05:43] messenger that will take all these loose
[1:05:45] ends out there and reveal a whole secret
[1:05:48] for the rap string of the church now
[1:05:55] that's what I say we think we know what
[1:05:56] we're talking about because we've got
[1:06:00] sevens we got this did Paul come at the
[1:06:05] end of the age I've asked you that
[1:06:10] before wait start on it many times where
[1:06:14] did Paul come right here right here
[1:06:16] where did Iranians come where did these
[1:06:19] come we're doing Elijah come
[1:06:28] you got eight messengers or our manifest
[1:06:32] let me use the word because it only use
[1:06:34] it as an angel in you got eight
[1:06:36] manifestations of God during the church
[1:06:38] ages because this age is very special
[1:06:41] you got to in this age you got the Holy
[1:06:46] Ghost coming himself and he came on a
[1:06:52] Susur Street but then brother Branham
[1:06:57] come along in the 30s and 40s and
[1:07:01] brought the message do you say whatever
[1:07:07] you just you just make things so
[1:07:09] complicated
[1:07:12] you got the pulpit you say well why
[1:07:19] don't say only what the prophets saying
[1:07:20] all right we found in the study of the
[1:07:27] scripture that the messenger to the
[1:07:29] aides come right at the end of the age
[1:07:31] every time so Paul according to what
[1:07:36] you're reading without understanding
[1:07:38] Paul come at the end of the age how
[1:07:40] could his message been to Ephesus simple
[1:07:50] question Irina's his message did he come
[1:07:56] at the end of the age then he was - that
[1:07:58] would have been the messenger - pergolas
[1:08:01] but you see here's where the prophet
[1:08:03] puts it in order now watch him Paul come
[1:08:09] at the end of the age so bring Paul
[1:08:12] right here then he can bring the message
[1:08:15] to Ephesus and they cabbage down on it I
[1:08:19] rainiest falls right here
[1:08:21] come forth brings the message to some
[1:08:24] lerna Martin each one goes let's read it
[1:08:29] we find out that Iranians come at the
[1:08:31] end of the age Martin into the age
[1:08:35] Luther the end of the Catholic age now
[1:08:39] where's the
[1:08:39] catholic age onto here so did luther
[1:08:43] come here or did he come here wesley at
[1:08:52] the end of the lutheran age now we've
[1:08:59] got it laid out in order Wesley come at
[1:09:05] the end of Luther's they had to put
[1:09:06] Wesley way down here if you're just
[1:09:08] courtly minded and Pentecost at the end
[1:09:14] of the age of sanctification your
[1:09:18] sanctification yours Wesley at the end
[1:09:25] of the Pentecostal age see brother
[1:09:28] Branham is not the messenger to the lady
[1:09:30] of seein Church age the Holy Ghost
[1:09:36] himself is the messenger you don't put a
[1:09:41] man in there you put the Holy Ghost and
[1:09:43] done it as Wesley to dine down with
[1:09:47] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:48] Ghost came on is this the street of
[1:09:53] course there's still a lot of people
[1:09:54] don't believe that the Zeus's people had
[1:09:57] the baptism of the Holy Ghost well I've
[1:09:59] argued that all the way down that's
[1:10:00] telling don't worry about it but that's
[1:10:06] the reason they took a prophetic prophet
[1:10:09] to come down no messenger to the aged
[1:10:15] there was no messenger to be placed our
[1:10:18] a man it was the Holy Ghost that come on
[1:10:21] the Zeus's tree then brother Branham
[1:10:26] came into N to bring the message to take
[1:10:28] all the scruples is that the words of
[1:10:31] the Prophet we read while ago but you
[1:10:35] see that's where you don't want to
[1:10:36] listen to that point because you know
[1:10:38] that it's tearing things apart not
[1:10:41] trying to tear down the message turning
[1:10:42] apart are our personal ideas and
[1:10:45] tolerance and see you still the hook
[1:10:48] just as well as say in the seventh day
[1:10:53] like I told you but that meant work at
[1:10:54] time you some of you heard it something
[1:10:57] that but I was just standing uptown and
[1:11:00] because I speaking on the rest and how
[1:11:04] that the Sabbath the old Sabbath was the
[1:11:06] sixth day
[1:11:07] I mean seventh day and Jesus raised the
[1:11:10] first day of the week and this man right
[1:11:14] out in front car we was in I read lunch
[1:11:17] right he said what are you trying to say
[1:11:20] I said I'm trying to simply just take a
[1:11:24] calendar and the Bible and show you that
[1:11:28] Israel worshiped under the Sabbath rest
[1:11:30] the seventh day we worship in honor of
[1:11:33] the resurrection some of you heard what
[1:11:37] happened after then that man took out
[1:11:43] his pocketknife and he said there
[1:11:47] twiddling his fingers and he was so mad
[1:11:50] that didn't stop me because I done made
[1:11:55] the statement I didn't call him out and
[1:12:00] rebuke him I just denied him even
[1:12:03] sitting there but he had his knife out
[1:12:07] he was shaking you so mad at me for what
[1:12:15] see you're seventh-day adventists is
[1:12:19] right with an Old Testament rest do you
[1:12:24] understand the way I said that with an
[1:12:26] Old Testament rest you're seventh-day
[1:12:28] adventists is correct but we don't
[1:12:32] worship on the seventh day we worship on
[1:12:35] the first day as an honor of the
[1:12:37] Resurrection not as a commandment we
[1:12:41] don't have a commandment to keep any day
[1:12:42] we've got to keep every day every day is
[1:12:46] the same with the Christian but then
[1:12:49] when your prophet picked it up he
[1:12:51] brought a release 7 7 is 49 now think
[1:12:55] about I know I didn't take enough
[1:12:57] talking back there on that but think
[1:13:00] about it
[1:13:01] 7 7 is 49 representative Church aid and
[1:13:05] brother Branham come to bring the
[1:13:06] message
[1:13:07] at the end of lady osya he stepped on
[1:13:10] the scene to bring a message he stepped
[1:13:13] on the scene in the 30s and 40s right in
[1:13:15] there he had to do what he said on the
[1:13:18] church age book 327 church eggs will
[1:13:21] this messenger Malachi for Luke 17 32 do
[1:13:24] two things one turn are the children
[1:13:26] back faith and thought to revealed the
[1:13:29] seven thunders which is revelation
[1:13:30] obtained in the seven seals
[1:13:32] it'll be these divinely revealed mystery
[1:13:34] truths that literally turn the hearts of
[1:13:36] the children back that's exactly the
[1:13:38] quote he's so brother Branham had to do
[1:13:43] a work of restoration under the baptism
[1:13:46] of the Holy Ghost which was son of God
[1:13:54] and remember you come three sons nine he
[1:14:00] said he's the son he's son of God during
[1:14:01] the seven churches he said when I come
[1:14:04] on
[1:14:05] I've got him laying here in front of me
[1:14:06] if he owner Ito the unveiling of God he
[1:14:09] said just for a moment right in between
[1:14:12] you turned back to the Son of Man
[1:14:14] see when brother Branham come on the
[1:14:16] earth he had to he came up under that
[1:14:18] Holy Ghost he was speaking of the son of
[1:14:22] man then that when he reached his
[1:14:26] message what his match it was all way
[1:14:32] back he was to do two things he was to
[1:14:38] turn us back to the word then he was to
[1:14:41] bring the seals so his message beginning
[1:14:45] the seals the other was restoration
[1:14:48] that's what I'm telling you this age has
[1:14:51] two things this age had it perfect to
[1:14:58] line up with Leviticus and to line up
[1:15:01] with the others because you come 7 7 is
[1:15:03] 49 brother Branham was that messenger
[1:15:08] that rode through the land that we rid
[1:15:10] of the high priest or the priest was to
[1:15:14] ride through the land and declare
[1:15:16] Liberty to come for the next year
[1:15:21] and as he rode through the land it was
[1:15:24] his message right
[1:15:28] it was his message that declared the
[1:15:32] Liberty whose message was it in the days
[1:15:34] of Paul it was Paul's message that set 2
[1:15:38] people free these churches had a
[1:15:42] messenger but this age had a compound
[1:15:46] meaning of the Holy Ghost coming himself
[1:15:49] in his fullness in the baptism and then
[1:15:54] after he comes the messenger comes to
[1:15:57] bring the message for this day do you
[1:16:02] understand what it would mean you work 6
[1:16:05] years
[1:16:09] and the priest would ride through the
[1:16:12] land and tell you next year is a release
[1:16:20] in those church ages you had a messenger
[1:16:23] to each age to declare the baptism in
[1:16:27] the Holy Ghost the release the Word of
[1:16:28] God for the aged and what was needed
[1:16:31] when you come to Azusa Street you had no
[1:16:35] man standing there
[1:16:36] you had the Holy Ghost to come himself
[1:16:39] in his fullness the Prophet said no
[1:16:42] messenger he said to the aged because
[1:16:45] the Holy Ghost came inside then at the
[1:16:51] end of the age the Prophet comes on the
[1:16:52] scene because remember what this
[1:16:55] prophets going to do no messenger in any
[1:17:00] age done what this prophet had to do did
[1:17:05] you follow me
[1:17:05] I said no messenger in any age done what
[1:17:09] this prophet had to do because the
[1:17:12] messenger in the age would just declare
[1:17:14] a Liberty for the six-year this man had
[1:17:22] to declare Liberty for the six going
[1:17:24] into the seventh as a rest but then in
[1:17:30] that he declared oh the
[1:17:37] that's why toes he I said this in 74 I
[1:17:42] said we could prize to hear your 2026
[1:17:44] nobody wants to know where that come
[1:17:46] from they come from the from this
[1:17:49] putting together this dates and times
[1:17:50] and seasons of the Prophet 2026 would be
[1:17:58] 49 which would be a jubilee there were
[1:18:03] 49 we didn't wanted a cover a 50 if you
[1:18:13] could think about it enough to get to a
[1:18:14] 50 this prophet when I sat down
[1:18:19] listening to him as I said he was
[1:18:22] talking about the God I had seen myself
[1:18:29] he was talking about the god of the word
[1:18:37] he was bringing the word throughout I
[1:18:39] could understand
[1:18:43] he was bringing me to an understanding
[1:18:46] of a Jubilee that word Jubilee give me
[1:18:53] just a minute that word Jubilee means a
[1:18:58] release there was release over seven
[1:19:02] years but then there was to be a 50 like
[1:19:06] white said they never physically ever
[1:19:08] celebrated the physical 50 because he's
[1:19:13] going out to let everything go free and
[1:19:15] it wouldn't go do it
[1:19:18] nobody ever celebrated the physical 50
[1:19:31] with you and I gonna have to take a
[1:19:33] change this prophets message was to come
[1:19:38] to show us eternal life he was to the
[1:19:43] car to declare liberty that had never
[1:19:46] been declared before he was to declare a
[1:19:51] 50 49 s only spoke of the church ages in
[1:19:56] this church age and that prophet entered
[1:20:01] the land with his message back there if
[1:20:03] you wanted this put it in a time bracket
[1:20:05] somewhere in 62 he started his own
[1:20:09] message I'll give you the quotes on all
[1:20:12] of that rapture message all of them not
[1:20:15] in the years of preparation not in the
[1:20:17] years of the healing campaign I'll give
[1:20:19] you the prophets quotes on all these
[1:20:21] thing but when he said he when they
[1:20:26] begin to say little Brennan spoke of
[1:20:30] eternal life here that's what caught me
[1:20:34] we spoke of eternal life dire and you
[1:20:38] say no no come on ain't gonna argue with
[1:20:40] you and just tell it you believe it or
[1:20:42] not we stood and looked at it one day
[1:20:45] we're coming to eternal life we think
[1:20:47] we're safe we hope we say I believe I'm
[1:20:50] saying you can't tell me I am saved now
[1:20:53] how many of you went through that and
[1:20:55] how many of you heard people say that
[1:20:59] but I Wrentham never come to to try to
[1:21:02] destroy anything you had become to tell
[1:21:04] you what you had was right but you
[1:21:06] needed to step up a step you needed to
[1:21:10] enter into a 50 so he went to the future
[1:21:14] home and I can't help it if it was told
[1:21:19] out I'm just telling it as it was toe
[1:21:22] that brother branham asked billy powell
[1:21:24] said did you understand what I taught on
[1:21:26] that future home he said yeah daddy he
[1:21:31] said Billy did you understand he said no
[1:21:35] he said I can count on my hands the ones
[1:21:37] that did of course everybody knows all
[1:21:39] about it
[1:21:41] never had heard about it go to organized
[1:21:46] religion never had that one they had to
[1:21:50] age they had a ride
[1:21:54] look Church listen this one is so hard
[1:21:57] to try to breathe
[1:21:59] he realized God when it comes what did
[1:22:04] he say he says you work six years did
[1:22:09] you rest the settlement he said what are
[1:22:13] we gonna do
[1:22:14] he said God's gonna give you a double
[1:22:16] portion right you agree with that now
[1:22:19] God was gonna give a double portion to
[1:22:22] cover this to seventh know proportion
[1:22:26] now what are you gonna do about from
[1:22:28] their own you don't plant in the seventh
[1:22:34] you don't reap in the seventh what are
[1:22:39] you gonna eat Nate go remember in the
[1:22:46] eighth you've got a plant before you can
[1:22:50] reap right are we talking about farming
[1:22:56] is that plain language you got a double
[1:23:00] portion on the sixth that would last
[1:23:08] youth through the seventh and give you
[1:23:13] something to plant it's in the eighth
[1:23:15] when you do you planting that's where
[1:23:18] they never understood brother branham on
[1:23:20] the future home he was talking about a
[1:23:22] plant Nate he wouldn't talking about a
[1:23:24] reaping remember what he says in that
[1:23:30] future he says all them tops
[1:23:37] chatters has gone away now you've come
[1:23:40] to reality read the future home
[1:23:43] you've come to reality of an eight come
[1:23:53] on you've got seven eight you got to go
[1:23:57] to the ninth here to reap a harvest
[1:24:00] because that's exactly what the children
[1:24:03] of Israel done when they entered the
[1:24:08] promised land they ate of the old corn
[1:24:13] of the land right they ate of the old
[1:24:20] corn they said what are we gonna do
[1:24:22] Moses says we're gonna eat what they got
[1:24:25] yeah but we're gonna be out next year he
[1:24:27] said no not because we're gonna plant
[1:24:33] they plant it in the eighth and reap
[1:24:39] their harvest in the ninth year you say
[1:24:43] you don't go to much luck
[1:24:44] I'm not going to much afar because that
[1:24:47] number eight once you get that number
[1:24:48] eight you'll have to worry about it
[1:24:49] that's what I was trying to say well ago
[1:24:51] so I stood back there in 1974 and said
[1:24:55] this can pass the Year 2026 and never
[1:24:58] missed the prophets message nor the
[1:25:00] Bible because 19 in 77 you would have
[1:25:04] entered a 50th Jubilee for the bride
[1:25:08] only not for the world or anybody else
[1:25:10] for the bride 1977 would be the 50th
[1:25:13] Jubilee the only one that ever come into
[1:25:18] being and we've turned it down we've had
[1:25:24] 50 years right 40 42 42 from 77 or
[1:25:31] something he's got about 42 years or
[1:25:33] something I ain't no mathematician but
[1:25:35] that's fur clothes you got 40 years
[1:25:39] we're heading towards a 50
[1:25:45] what if that's that time in between to
[1:25:49] elapse
[1:25:50] what if God's letting time run out in us
[1:25:55] to dwell on a fifty because the church
[1:25:59] here's what I've been saying now if you
[1:26:01] want to listen how long have I been
[1:26:03] teaching of a present tense I am in 1974
[1:26:10] that's what I was preaching a fifty is
[1:26:15] that I am present tense God 1977 this
[1:26:22] message came alive to me what did it do
[1:26:29] to you well I'm just still reading samo
[1:26:32] book I feel saying it came alive to me
[1:26:39] there because I saw what he's talking
[1:26:44] about seven sevens is 49 brother branham
[1:26:51] come into 49th which was a seventh
[1:26:53] Church age now listen and then that
[1:26:57] seventh church age the Holy Ghost had
[1:26:59] preceded him to bring the word but when
[1:27:06] he came it took a while to him to preach
[1:27:11] restoration back to the faith of the
[1:27:13] fathers but in 62 when he stood there on
[1:27:17] the statue of perfect man he said he's
[1:27:19] preached it
[1:27:19] he said 30-something years I've waited
[1:27:22] our priest on this he struck his message
[1:27:26] in 63 of eternal life how many times
[1:27:31] have you heard me make this statement go
[1:27:35] home pick up the book that lists your
[1:27:42] tapes go home pick up the book that
[1:27:48] lists your tapes and read and start in
[1:27:54] 63 from the seals own and read me one
[1:27:57] take one of those message
[1:27:59] where he had anything natural they were
[1:28:03] all supernatural what about a prophet
[1:28:08] had preached so much on one God until
[1:28:10] the world had turned against him he
[1:28:12] needed to Clark Jesus Christ to be that
[1:28:14] Almighty God and preached it around the
[1:28:17] world seven times and they turned him
[1:28:19] down all at once he says I'm gonna
[1:28:30] preach on Christ the mystery of God
[1:28:31] revealed now listen to him as he gets in
[1:28:37] the book he said I'm gonna preach on
[1:28:40] Christ the mystery of God revealed and
[1:28:44] he said if you don't get them sealed
[1:28:50] what do you say he said if you don't get
[1:28:55] them sealed go back to seal book and all
[1:28:57] that wouldn't what he said because he
[1:29:00] knew we didn't understand it that way he
[1:29:03] said if you don't get them seals come
[1:29:04] back to this message tonight what Christ
[1:29:07] the mystery of God revealed read the
[1:29:10] book and see see if he said it don't you

[1:29:29] self-existing etcetera etc all of the
[1:29:32] titles he put him in a lamb in order
[1:29:34] after the opening of the seals he
[1:29:38] preached who is this melchester day he
[1:29:42] didn't preach in the series in the 57 he
[1:29:46] preached who Melchizedek was now he's
