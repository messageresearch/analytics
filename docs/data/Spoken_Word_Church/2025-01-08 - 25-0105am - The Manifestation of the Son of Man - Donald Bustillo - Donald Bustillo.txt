worthy To Be [Aplausos] praised Thank the lord Jesus this a testimony um sometimes things come up and It's something that happened in the past but it came up Uh this morning on my heart and um It's just about Broken families Cuz I've been able to experience that in my family itself my Sons don't have their fathers in their Life they're there but they're not there so It's been Pretty much Me And It's just been a lot going on but I see the lord restoring things Of course and um my youngest son grandmother called me um Yesterday and She said Uh She said you know It's really been on my heart about Broken families Black families to be more exact even though We have all races That's Broken in different Times but The Black families came up on Our Heart and also on m Just just a long Time and Just It's just something Else to see when you see it and you just see the the the brokenness and even my son Just coming and Getting out of trouble Just got into some trouble recently and Just the things we're dealing with and the things he got to go through with consequences of the choices he made and It's just It's just been it Just was a shocker and it hurts Because as a Mom you trying to do the best you can and with God help of course It makes it easier but It's Still hard when you see your children got to deal and go through things that you didn't want them to have to go through but God knows what they need and um anyway this this Child came On My Mind a While ago in this neighborhood that Uh we grew Up In kind of lived in for about 10 years When Isaac was about um maybe six so It was like a It was an eight-year-old Little Boy his name Was khalil and I'll Never forget him And I wasn't even thinking about him but he came on my heart this morning and he was a Bad Child he was a little troublemaker in the neighborhood and All the other Kids kind of knew it Cuz he Just Had this Thing That ca trouble you know and you just Almost want to Stay away from your children so um during that Time the lord was dealing With Me too but I wasn't fully in yet but the lord Still was dealing with me so I was trying to get it right but I wasn't fully living right but in that season um I remember Just telling Isaac you know let's Just pray for this Little Boy he need Prayer instead of Us you know condemning him or Talking About him let's pray for him he needs Prayer and his mother would Always kind of say Bad things to him and Just Treat him kind of Bad to And I noticed That I kind of was like Man That's That's not good you know and Uh so One Day um Me And her Had like a small conversation we weren't Close or anything but we end up Talking About Something I don't know I ran into her and we was talking and at that time the lord was dealing with me on like the words that we say and How it got Power in it so somehow I brought up to her about kind of The Way She was talking to him not not in a way to Tell her What to do but Just somehow the conversation came up And I was Like You Know Something of the sort Of You know Maybe the words that You're saying might be affecting him but I didn't I don't remember exactly How I said it but It was very peaceable not to kind of Tell her What To Do Or How She should Do it but somehow it came up but anyway Little by Little this Little Boy started to change and It was obvious Because he wasn't that way but I was Just remembering this today on my on my r to Church And I was like Wow the power of Love Not Just praying for him we started treating him with love too and Just treating him kind as we could and he started to change this Little Boy changed And um It was It was Just so obvious Cuz It was the opposite so I'm just want to bring up the power of Love and Prayer even When things Don't look like it can change or get better Love Prayer changes things I just want to bring that Up Praise the lord Jesus amen That's exactly right my goodness the power of the tongue my wife And I we were Listen to that coming in

manifestarse comienza darse a conocer comienza a revelarse entre hijo de Dios e hijo de David está el misterio gloria a Dios así que de eso queremos hablar yo sé que ustedes lo manejan muy bien pero solamente solamente venimos a remachar alabado sea el señor Así que el día en que el hijo del hombre Jesucristo se manifieste se estaría dando a conocer se estaría dando a conocer primeramente Apocalipsis 107 primeramente el Ministerio del hermano branam y todos sabemos que Lucas 17:30 la manifestación del hijo del hombre se cumplió el 28 de febrero 19 cuando el señor Jesucristo ahí lo tienen ustedes Gloria a Dios tenía que haber una gente en esta hora que pudiera entender eso Muchos tienen esa foto en el celular en la casa pero no la entienden no le dan el verdadero valor de lo que tomó lugar el 28 de febrero de 1963 Pero tenía que haber una gente una gente con perfección profética una gente con habilidad de poder oír de poder captar lo que tomó lugar ese día el 28 de febrero de 1923 era Lucas 17:30 la manifestación del hijo de hombre viniendo primeramente Cómo viniendo primeramente Apocalipsis un profeta en la escena Aleluya y luego después de 1965 porque cuando hablamos de que el hijo del hombre vino primeramente al hermano branam allí no tenemos problema todo está bien ahí allí no hay problema pero cuando decimos que después de los días del hermano br después de que el hermano br El hijo del hombre Aleluya tenía que continuar su ministerio aleluya gloria a Dios Entonces ahí es donde la cosa se empieza a poner un poco tremendo Gloria a Dios am Entonces el hijo del hombre vino primeramente a un hijo de hombre a un profeta en la escena 1923 hasta 1925 pero luego de que Apocalipsis 17 donde estuvo el hijo del hombre siendo revelado luego ahí no se terminó todo continuaba la escritura venía en continuidad lo que seguía era Apocalipsis 10 era Apocalipsis 2217 era nuestro ministerio el Ministerio de la esposa el espíritu de la esposa dicen Ven y el que tenga venga a beber del agua porque hoy ella en él en ella es la Fuente abierta la Fuente final que está abierta en esta hora Gloria a Dios así que en este 2025 vamos a ver por medio de la escritura por medio del mensaje en qué parte de la jornada nos encontramos en el Ministerio del hijo del hombre en qué parte del Ministerio del hijo del hombre Jesucristo su manifestación nos encontramos porque se nos prometió que el Ministerio del hijo del hombre que operó al principio de la Biblia en Génesis 18 aleluya aleluya gloria a Dios porque el hijo del hombre operó en Génesis operó la mitad de la Biblia y y está operando al final de La Biblia el hijo del hombre en Génesis a la mitad de la Biblia y al final de La Biblia Gloria a diosel Así que vemos en en en Génesis en Génesis 18 donde hubo un descender de Elohim El hijo del hombre a Abraham primeramente y luego a Sara Gloria a Dios El hijo del hombre Elohim Aleluya Dios visitó a Abraham primeramente y luego visitó a sar justo antes de que y Gomorra fueran destruid justo antes de que sod y Gomorra fueran destru eloh la manifestación del hijo del h visitó abrah y luego en continuidad manifestación del hijo del hombre operó a la mitad de la Biblia en su primera venida y esa venida del hijo del hombre fue secreta solo un grupito lo vio solo un grupito lo vio los demás no lo pudieron ver eran religiosos como el cañón de una pistola como el cañón de una pistola era pulidos oraban oraban iban al templo ayunaban hacían vigilias aleluya gloria a Dios leían los escritos de Moisés escuchaban las cintas Escuchaban el mensaje era gente pulida no lo podía señalar ni nada pero pero ahí estaba en la escena el que Moisés presentó el que Moisés dijo Jehová levantará profeta Así que ahí estaba en la escena el que Moisés presentó el que Moisés habló que estaba el hijo del hombre y no lo pudier solo un grupito lo vio solo un grupito lo vio fue una venida secreta y esta venida es más secreta todavía solo un grupito lo está viendo solo un grupito lo Gloria a Dios así que vemos entonces la manifestación del hijo del hombre en Génesis a la mitad de la Biblia estaría operando de nuevo en su segunda venida en el tiempo del fin am Así que entre la quinta y sexta trompeta de Apocalipsis 8 y Apocalipsis 9 y la Séptima trompeta de Apocalipsis 11 en medio está el misterio de Apocalipsis 10 es donde Lucas 17:30 está descendiendo ha descendido El hijo del hombre descendió entre la quinta y sexta trompeta que ya sonaron en la primera y segunda guerra m para regresar a todo el pueblo de Israel a su Patria y Apocalipsis 11 el Ministerio de Moisés y Elías para llamar a los 144000 en medio está el misterio El hijo del hombre Lucas 17:30 dándose a conocer ahí está escondido el secreto de su venida Amén porque este es el mensaje de la hora El Mesías está aquí Ese fue el mensaje que los pastores traí en su primera venida el mensaje que el Ángel les trajo a los pastores f o está nacido hoy en la cad un Salvador ya estaba en la escena y ese mensaje vino a pastores El Mesías está aquí Gloria a Dios nadie más sabía eso se le abrió a pastores a obejero su primera venida fue revelada a pastores su segunda venida tenía que ser igual revelado a pastores para que los pastores se lo revelen al pueblo alabado sea el señor Okay cómo vamos despacio mu muy rápido vamos bien puede hacer como como usted sienta her allá en Honduras allá los buses andan andan unos rótulos que dice Cristo viene Cristo viene es doina de buses pero nosotros decimos Cristo Está Aquí Aleluya ap está en nosotros alelu Oh Gloria y esta venida es secreta secreta solo El Elegido lo va a ha solo El Elegido lo está cando porque es una venida espiritual aleluya gloria a Dios así que no queremos esa doctrina de bus él está aquí y más bien ya se va ya se va Gloria a Dios alabado sea Señor aleluya Así que vemos Así que entre la quinta y sexta trompeta que sonaron para el pueblo de Israel primera y segunda guerra mundial que regresaron lo regresaron a su Patria y entre Apocalipsis 11 la séptima trompeta ahí en medio ahí está el misterio Ahí está encerrado el secreto Lucas 17:30 Apocalipsis 10 Mateo 25 primeres 416 el señor mismo descendiendo Está escondido escondidito para el religioso para el miembro de iglesia esondido pero se iba a necesitar el El está atacando hoy porque el está atacando el Ministerio Y esa es una apretura que la tenemos dentro del mensaje cuando el quiere quitar Efesios 41 porque él sabe el minister 4 No puede haber perfección de los santos sin el Ministerio Gloria a Dios eso es la escritura herman la escritura no puede ser quebrantada la escritura no puede ser quebrada es el absoluto aleluya Así que tenía que haber un Ministerio desp de losas her tenían que aparecer y ya están aquí los hombres maravillosos los maravillosos ayudantes que tenían que difundir la luz Aleluya la luz que Dios trajo a través de un profeta tenía que ser difundida por medio del Ministerio de otros que han sido fielmente instruidos así que esos hombres maravillosos en Efesios 411 el Ministerio de los ministros que iban a encontrar estas cosas y se las iban a dar a la iglesia para perfeccionar a los santos Gloria a Dios la perfección de los santos viene por medio obrando a través del minister no hay otro programa no hay otro programa pero el nos está presentando otro programa que no es el programa escritural Gloria a Dios alabado sea el señor ahora regresemos de nuev siedes not luc 1 28 Ahí está escondido el misterio de abrah y dice escritura dice as como suc losas de esó el misterio de Abraham y Sara si usted lee la escritura no dice así como fue en los días de Abraham Y Sara no dice así no no no así como fue los días de así fue como los días de Noé entonces allí dejó escondido el misterio de Abraham y sar porque en Génesis 18 El hijo del hombre se reveló a Abraham primero trató con Abraham estuvo detenido con Abraham por mucho tiempo revelándole el misterio aah revelándole el misterio a hasta 1965 Pero él le dijo a Abraham en el tiempo de la vida Yo volveré y Sara tendrá un hijo así que él estaba hablando Ya de Sara Pero Sara estaba escondidita estaba detrás de la tienda porque porque el hijo del hombre Elohim estaba detenido con Abraham Pero Sara recibirá una visitación Aleluya entonces Esas cosas quedaron escritas allí para que nosotros podamos ver que después de los días del Hero El hijo del hombre tenía que continuar ahora en esta sala de hoy porque este es el día génes Dios visitó Abraham está visitando alabado sea su nombre Porque a través de los tipos podemos Dios haciendo que Dios hizo en Sara en lo que Dios hizo en Rebeca en lo que Dios hizo en Rut en lo que Dios hizo en Ester en todos los aspectos femeninos podemos ver lo que Dios está haciendo hoy con nosotros en este día así que en Génesis 18 ahora ahora Yo estoy trayendo esto porque el misterio del hijo del hombre no concluyó cuando el hermano branam se fue no concluyó Por qué Porque el Ministerio del hijo del hombre concluye con la predicación a los Eternamente perdidos el Ministerio del hijo del hombre a la mitad de la Biblia concluyó con la resurrección de los santos y la predicación a los perdidos Así que el Ministerio del hijo del hombre en este día no concluyó cuando el hermano branam se Ju tenía que continuar Porque el hermano bran no entró a la predicación de los Eternamente perdidos él fue sacado de la escena a quién le toca eso Quién tiene que hacer eso Ho el Ministerio del hijo del hombre en la novia en la del cordero Gloria a Dios alabado sea su nombre Estamos contentos repasando algunas cositas ahora miremos esto El hijo del hombre en el hermano PR no entró a la predicación de los perdidos él fue detenido y en 1965 24 de diciembre el fue sacado de la esca acaso el Ministerio del hijo del hombre terminó cuando el hermano brandam se fue Se acabó todo ahí no no no podía terminar él tenía que continuar porque el Ministerio del hijo del hombre termina con la predicación a los Eternamente perdidos Aleluya estamos bien Gloria a Dios así que él tenía que predicar a los Eternamente perdidos tenía que venir la resurrección tenía que venir la resurrección pero hermano br se F entonces si el hermano branam ya no está aquí en quién lo hace Allí es donde tiran flechas Yo sé que no aquí están bien entrenados pero esto está saliendo por la vía de Internet Pero Aleluya el Ministerio del hijo del hombre en el hermano pran tenía que ir a la predicación a los perdidos y y a la resurrección de los Sant si él entra ahí nos quedamos fuera nosotros pero él fue detenido él fue detenido y él fue sacado de la escena Aleluya pero el Ministerio del hijo del hombre continuaba y continúa a la predicación de los perdidos Así que si el hermano bram ya no está entonces en quién lo hace en nosotros Porque hoy nosotros la novia la esposa es el hijo del hombre en la tierra Gloria a Dios aleluya aleluya gloria a Dios me voy a ir a a a a a un mensajito a ver si lo ponemos por ahí se llama el mensaje el juicio Espero que en el inglés también las mismas palabras lo digan en el mensaje del juicio usted saben que el hermano brandam predicó Casi cinco mensajes del juicio este fue predicado el cuatro del 19 de 1964 y él dice esto yo lo reto a usted yo lo reto a usted está lanzando un reto a usted a que crea que Jesucristo que revela en la forma del hijo del hombre en carne humana en el cuerpo de la novia Gloria yo lo reto a usted es un reto Que el Espíritu Santo por Med hermano branam está lanzándose yo lo reto a usted a que crea que Jesucristo se revela la forma del hijo del hombre en carne humana en el cuerpo de la novia Aleluya eso no necesita interpretación eso no necesita idea eso no necesita poner su sus interpretaciones razonar eso como Eva lo razonó solo solo lo creemos entonces la novia hoy el la esposa Hoy es el hijo del [Música] hombre aleluya aleluya gloria por eso les decía cuando hablamos que el hijo del hombre estuvo en el hermano br ahí todo el mundo está tranquilo Oh Gloria a Dios somos del mismo mensaje creemos lo mismo alelu pero cuando ya le muestra esta etapa la continuación la continuación que el Ministerio del hijo del hombre no terminó ahí sino que continua en nosotros Ay hermano ya anda creyendo otras cosas usted está fuera porque la gente está acostumbrada en el mensaje al tenerlos entretenidos Y como decía su pastor a la gente le gusta que las tengan entretenidos le gusta que los tengan entretenidos sí Aleluya pero cuando el espíritu santo viene y muestra estas cosas la gente empieza a razonar estas son las nuevas Estas son las cosas nuevas que están siendo declaradas en este nuevo día amén no cosas nuevas traídas fuera cosas nuevas traídas dentro del mensaje aquí están los levitas hoy dándo el verdadero sentido a la escritura no dio eso el hermano el espíritu santo no dijo eso el espíritu santo di Amén de nehemías que los levitas leían los escritos y le daban más sentido más sentido a lo que leía para que la gente entendiera eso es lo que está tomando lugar hoy am Recuerda que Jesús le dijo a los discípulos tengo muchas cosas que decirles pero no las podes sobrellevar no las podes sobrellevar tengo muchas cosas que decirles pero no las podes pero cuando venga el espíritu santo él les enseñará todas esas cosas Gloria a Dios no estamos así en esta hora el pleno entendimiento ha venido a nosotros Hero her El hijo del hombre había venido a él siete truenos habían rugido su voces pronunciaron su nombre nuevo el primer grano que llegó madurez él se vio en la escritura Quién era él se her él era eler Y qué fue lo que hizo eler en la Biblia fue a buscarle una esposa a Isaac Aleluya buscaron a Rebeca la trajo a Rebeca y hermano y la trajo a Isaac para que entrara Unión con ella y cuando ellos entraron a Unión no se vuelve a hablar de leer ya había salido a la escena dónde nos dejó el hermano br con Isaac Oh Gloria amor es son los tipos Así es así es como logramos entender lo que está tomando lugar hoy a través de los tipos de la Biblia Gloria a Dios alabado sea su nombre así que el hijo del hombre después de 1925 Ya no está en un solo hombre estuvo en un solo hombre El hijo del hombre Jesucristo la manifestación del hijo del hombre estuvo en un solo hombre en el siglo XX Aleluya alelu pero hoy después de 1925 está en su novia en su esposa está en un cuerpo de muchos miembros aleluya gloria a Dios Ahora muchos dentro de la estructura del mensaje aceptan que el hijo del hombre Lucas 17:30 Apocalipsis 10 estuvo en un solo hombre Amén le dicen eso Gloria a Dios le di pero cuando usted le dice por el mensaje que el hijo del hombre está siendo manifestado en su iglesia lo leímos la cita la novia hoy dice es la carne donde está el hijo del hombre Gloria a Dios Entonces ahí es donde ya no encaja la cosa entonces agarran piedras y se las empiezan a tirar Aleluya porque No entendieron la continuidad la continuidad de apocalipse la segunda cabalgata Deja que la paloma Los uil uil cuero muer y el cuerpo muerto es el cuerpo infalible de la manifestación del hijo del hombre ahí se iban a reunir las águilas Lucas 17 estarán dos en el campo uno será dejado y el otro será tomado estará en un molo dejado y el otro será tomado y le dijeron los discípulos señor a dónde le dijeron a dónde y él dijo donde estuviera el cuarto muerto Allí se reunirán las águilas por eso es que en esta hora muchos están siendo dejados para venir a comer del cuerpo de la mal liberación del hijo de hombre sios Aleluya Man nuevo and escondido aleluya gloria sea el nombre del señor están siendo dejados para venir a alimentarse de este alimento Así que aquí están reunidas las Águilas alimentándonos de la palabra infalible del cuerpo del hijo del hombre Gloria a Dios estamos bien ahora recuerde que la gente la gente lo quiere seguir viendo en la etapa que estuvo Gloria a Dios Dios Estuvo en el profeta y ahí no hay problema y hoy tenemos ministros que vienen a los púlpitos y tienen a las iglesias entretenidas con puras historias Gloria a Dios entiéndame lo que quiero decir pero no pueden ver la etapa que seguía porque Dios se ha escondido en sus cambios esó en sus cambios que se había subido un árbol y vino un perro y empezó a ladrarle Ahí estaba la ardilla en ese árbol pero de pronto la ardilla se bajó y se ju a otro árbol y el perro le seguía ladrando al árbol equivocado ya no estaba ahí la ardilla ya no estaba en apocalipsis 17 ahora estaba en apocalipsis 10 Ahora estaba en Apocalipsis 22 17 Gloria a Dios alabado sea su nombre vamos a poner otra cita eh Gloria a Dios esta cita está en Las edades de la iglesia que fueron predicadas en 1954 Aleluya alelu y él dice y en medio de los siete candeleros de oro a uno semejante al hijo del Hombre qué uno semejante a él Quién era este su novia uno semejante a él observe Cómo era observen Cómo era vestido de una ropa que llegaba hasta los pies la santidad de Jesucristo cubriéndola nos ha lavado nuestros pecados con su propia sangre mensaje racto no dijo el hermano ella está de pie ahí Ella está de pie ahí casada eloso hij nunca habiendo pecado Aleluya ahora sabemos que este pecó pero el adentro nunca ha pecado Aleluya ese de adentro le dice amada mía ti no hay mancha Así que le estamos predicando a una gente que ha sido lavada es es el misterio de la expiación Ese es el misterio de la expiación el misterio de la expiación del cordero que solo los hijos de Dios lo van a ver así que sigo con la cita sigo con la cita ceñido por el pecho hbre ceñido por el pecho no un hombre una mujer quién es esa mujer aleluya aleluya gloria le estoy predicando esa mujer quién es esa mujer son ustedes dice una mujer con un cinto de oro Amén alabado sea su nombre aleluya qué glorioso no es cierto Okay ahora avancemos avancemos ahora Nosotros sabemos que el señor Jesucristo el espíritu santo Tuvo tres manifestaciones él vino como hijo de hombre Perdón él vino como hijo del hombre él vino como hijo de de Dios y él viene como hijo de David todos sabemos eso verdad que el espíritu santo vino en tres manifestaciones hijo del hombre hijo de Dios hijo de David y entre hijo de Dios e hijo de David é prometió que Lucas 1730 sería manifestado voy aer otra c Elo de laua como fue en los días de Noé Así será en la venida del hijo del hombre ellos estaban comiendo bebiendo casándose dándose en casamiento y como fue en los días de l Así será en las horas que el hijo del hombre será revelado en la tierra ya nos hijo de Dios porque Las edades terminar no estamos en Las edades Aleluya Las edades terminaron espiritualmente ya no estamos en edades La odisea está ciega miserable desnuda y no lo sabeos sacad de ahí dice ya no ya no más hijo de Dios sino el hijo regresa con el mensaje profético para el último día así que Cuándo comenzó a cumplirse Lucas 17:30 Apocalipsis 101 primera Tesalonicenses 4:16 Mateo 25 28 de febrero de 1963 el señor mismo descendió no apareciendo en su cuerpo físico Con él apareció con que él apareció en su primera venida si no en un cuerpo teofano espiritual operando en un cuerpo de carne llamado William bram hasta 1925 amén Gloria a Dios Aleluya ahí tenemos Aleluya ese entendimiento de eso ha venido a un pueblo Aleluya la señal fue mostrada en el cielo y esa era una señal que era tiempo de Unión cuando la cabeza estaba apareciendo la cabeza estaba descendiendo era una señal de Unión el esposo está aquí Isaac está aquí boos está aquí Aleluya Oh gloria sea el nombre del señor era la señal de Unión El esposo está aquí y era una señal escritural siendo mostrada en el cielo era Mateo 25 descendiendo y Recuerden que el hermano branam dijo cuando Dios va hacer algo en la tierra él primero lo muestra en el cielo como en su primera venida hubo una señal en el cielo y solo tres magos lo vieron astrólogos vieron una señal en el cielo mostrando que El Mesías estaba aquí Amén aleluya y cuando ellos vieron la señal en el cieloo les mostró a ellos que algo había tomado lugar en la Tierra así que ellos empezaron su jornada en esa hora y llegaron a Jerusalén y cuando llegaron a Jerusalén ellos dijeron vamos a preguntarles aquí Dónde está El Mesías porque su estrella hemos visto es que estos tipos sí leen el mensaje pas oend alel como hoy entiéndanme lo que quiero decir y cuando yo le preguntaron no sabían nada no no Ellos tenían la doctrina de buses Cristo viene y ya estaba en la escena iban al templo oh Jehová y Jehová ya estaba ahí Aleluya ya estaba en la escena ya estaba con ellos Gloria a Dios una una venida secreta y esta de hoy es secreta así que así que hay una gente en esta hora con un entendimiento claro que al ver la señal en el cielo sabemos lo que está ocurriendo en la tierra Qué es lo que está ocurriendo en la tierra la cabeza siendo revelada entrando en vigencia en esta gran Unión prometida esta gran Unión invisible que po la están viendo mina loando otros no le encuentran el verdadero sentido al 28 de febrero de 1923 no le encuentran sentido Aleluya no le encuentran el verdadero sentido de lo que eso es así que 28 de febrero 19 la cabeza siendo revelada efesi Tú encuentras que la cabeza es la esposa de la iglesia de a ver si ponemos la cita Efesios 5 as es la cabeza de la es su cuerpo y es su Salvador entonces 28 de febrero es la venida del esposo y esta venida es secr el hermano br nos hablaba estas cosas y nos estaba diciendo grandes verdades la única que se dio cuenta cuando cuando Romeo venía por Julieta fue Julieta su mamá la Iglesia Católica y sus hermanas Las denominaciones no se dieron cuenta la única que que se dio cuenta cuando Romeo vino fue Julieta aleluya gloria del señor no está Romeo con nosotros en esta hora no hay intimidad detrás de la recámara no está él quitándose los velos no nos está abriendo su palabra él se está dejando ver Gloria a Dios él está en amores en esta hora es una Unión espiritual que está tomando lugar Aleluya Estamos contentos as que tenemos un entendimiento claro de lo que significa esa foto los demás la tienen pero no le no no le han dado el verdadero sentido que la señal fue mostrada en el cielo como una señal de tiempo de Unión y señal el esposo está aquí y eso es lo que está tomando lugar aquí Aquí estás tomando lugar una bodas am cuando usted habla eso la gente que no está conectada es Oh hermano comoo S como todos los ponen para allá y y no se dan cuenta lo que está tomando como dijo el hermano bram pueden hablar lo que Dios hizo atrás lo que Dios va a hacer allá pero que les está pasando por lo que Dios está haciendo en escena se les está pasando por la naric Pero tenía que haber una gente con una percepción profética con la habilidad de poder oír y poder ver lo que Dios está haciendo en esta hora el Espíritu Santo por medio del Efesios 4:11 se lo está revelando al pueblo y el espíritu santo viene y te lo abre y te lo muestra Gloria a diosel al Así que voy a leer otra cita probando su palabra probando su palabra dice ya la tenemos todavía no esperamos vamos a tomar agüita ya Gloria a Dios ya estamos terminando dice probando su palabra en aquel d hoy El hijo del hombre será revelado para unir la iglesia a la cabeza unirlos el casamiento de la novia el llamado del novio vendrá aquí por esto cuando el hijo del hombre baje y venga en carne humana para unir a los dos la vuelvo a leer de nuevo cuando el hijo del hombre baje y ya bajó Lucas 17:30 y venga en carne humana en qué carne vino primero ahí se encerró para para unir a los dos la iglesia tiene que ser la palabra él es la palabra y los dos se unen y para hacer eso y para hacer esta unión se necesitará la manifestación de la revelación del hijo del hombre por eso es los que no tienen esta revelación no han entrado Unión Pastor no han entrado ellos lo que le dicen es yo soy del mensaje hermano yo voy a la iglesia mi pastor es jul y tal Aleluya tengo laeng y asce y para hacer esto manifestación de la revelación del hijo del hombre estoy tratando de mirar dónde Okay vamos a dar tiempo dónde dejó de leer usted ahorita por aquí estábamos en no algún hombre eclesiástico pueden ver lo que quiero decir ven sí es el hijo del hombre Jesucristo que descenderá en carne humana entre nosotros y hará tan real su palabra que eso lo unirá a él con la iglesia Vuelvo y repito y hará tan real su palabra que eso lo unirá él con con a la iglesia la novia Y entonces ella se irá al hogar a la cena de las bodas Amén Ella ya está unida Ella ya está unida Ven vamos a la cena de las bodas no al casamiento porque el casamiento se lleva aquí a cabo llenad vuestras carnes mismo de toda carne de los hombres poderosos porque han llegado las bodas del cordero pero en el racto es que subimos a la cena de la boda cuando la palabra aquí se une con la persona Qué hace hermano repetirlo dice dice cuando la palabra aquí se une con la persona y los dos llegan a ser uno entonces qué hace manifiesta al hijo del hombre nuevamente no los teólogos de la iglesia no sa tod que se creen que saben más que el pastor no a los teólogos de la iglesia Dice el hijo del hombre y la iglesia llegan a ser uno cualquier cosa que hizo el hijo del hombre él fue la palabra la iglesia hace la misma cosa Gloria a Dios alabado sea el señor Estamos contentos en esta hora Así que esto es lo que está tomando lugar él está haciendo tan real su palabra que eso la une a él es la revelación del hijo del hombre siendo presentada a ella ella lo ve ella lo capta y allí donde se produce la unión Gloria a Dios alabado sea su nombre Espero que estemos disfrutando de todavía podemos segir herman un poquito más Oh gloria sea al señor okay Voy a irme a otra cita voy a irme a otra cita Aleluya en el mensaje miren hacia Jesús voy a entrar aquí Bueno predicado el 12 de diciembre 1963 12 de diciembre de 193 el tercero está debidamente identificado sabemos Dónde está as que el tercer está aquí esan sagrado que no debo decir mucho acerca de es un secreto él dijo el tercer jalón está plenamente identificado El tercer jalón está aquí Así que el hijo del hombre en el hermano branam entró en el tercer jalón y el Ministerio comenzó a desarrollarse hermano br comenzó a desenvolverse Aleluya el Ministerio del hijo del hombre primeramente en apocalipsis 17 y el hijo del hombre en el tercer jalón Tuvo tres partes la primera parte del tercer jalón fue cuando la palabra hablada operó en el Ministerio del hermano br creando cosas la segunda parte del tercer jalón fue la apertura de los siete sellos la apertura y la apertura significa el inicio Aleluya la apertura de los siete sellos Y de esa apertura de los siete sellos que eran las siete voces de trueno de allí de los siete truenos se desenvolvió a algo más que yo vi Okay okay Aleluya ya si entramos ahí son otros 20 20 más otros Aleluya pero no me voy a meter aquí okay la segunda parte del tercer jalón fue la apertura de los sellos fue la apertura de la palabra y lo que seguía de la tercera parte del Tercer jal lo que seguía era la predicación a los Eternamente perdidos voy a citar otra cita miren hacia Jesús es el mensaje también que nosotros lo tenemos en español apartando la mirada hacia Jesús dice se está apretando Y entonces cuando llegue ese tiempo y la presión llegue a tal grado de que ustedes se han echado fuera por la presión entonces fíjense en lo que estoy a punto de decirles en unos minutos observen El tercer jalón entonces y será absolutamente para los que están totalmente perdidos pero será para la novia y la iglesia Gloria a Dios hablando de un tiempo que va a venir observen El tercer jalón y él está hablando de una predicación a los Eternamente perdidos Así que después de que el hijo del después de que el hijo del hombre estoy aterrizando estoy aterrizando después de que el hijo del hombre en un profeta el minister hermano tuvo el Ministerio de la palabra hablada abrió la palabra tuvo la apertura de los sellos lo que seguía era la predicación a los perdidos allí en ese espacio de tiempo la nota se paró la nota se paró Allí se paró se terminó todo no no no no el hermano br fue sacado de la escena
