«  151_       †        Now, for the birth of the Word is Christ, not of polluted with denominations. The early Church, no denominations, just the Word, and Spirit irrigated. Brother, the... God laid the Word down like that, and the Holy Spirit irrigated It, and there She went. She brought forth children. Certainly.

«  233       †          Look, Christ in you makes Him the center of Life of the revelation. See? Christ's Life in you makes Him the center of the revelation. Christ, in the Bible, makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ. Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing, see, what God is trying to do.
234    What is the new Birth then? You'd say, "Well, Brother Branham, what is the new Birth?" It is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you. Amen! See? Not you joined a church, you shook a hand, you done something different, you said a creed, you promised to live by a--a code of rules. But Christ, the Bible, He is the Word that was revealed to you. And no matter what anybody says, what takes place, it's Christ; pastor, priest, whatever it might be. It's Christ in you, that is the revelation that the Church was built upon.

«  146       †          But the five streams you see coming down through here, tempers this together. It has been the Holy Spirit that made the Ephesus church. It was the Holy Spirit that birthed the Smyrnaean church. The Holy Spirit that give the Pergamos church, and the Thyatira church, in the Dark Ages. It's the Holy Spirit that's built that Bride, the Elect that's pulled out of all the organization systems down through the ages, like that. There's an Elected, a predestinated Bride of Jesus Christ, that the Holy Spirit has called out the Elect. And it's been...

does she say these are Isabel or something yes she's got a funny way of saying her middle name but she's a Roberts and we thank God for that you know I appreciate that now too I want to say something now we're getting a lot of kids well we try to reserve the back part benches if we can you know for mothers and children and the little ones I mean you know how to set our now that's just what we try

that's all right we'll take care of it we can we can handle everything just be that way and if you have to set a little closer you know I mean you know you don't have to have one bench for one person

anyhow you know we do the best we can do till the Lord comes and then we ain't worried about it right but ain't in first Peter 1 and then jaw to father we thank you for this day and your grace Lord thank you for the hour that we have upon the earth the time and father we pray that you would just got each one of us now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts because you know what's on our thoughts and mind and that thing Lord that you've put there for us to speak about tonight so just have your way and let your grace and love be with each one we love you we thank you and blessings the Father forgive our sins because we want to be cleansed and you got each one that blessed a little ride around the world and all of the things we committed to you in Jesus name Amen we've had a good time of rest and in all of different ministers ministry and I really enjoyed them we've had a good time and all of that so now we get back into regular routine alright alright first Peter watch what Peter goes and says for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot Hoover Lee was foreordained before the foundation of the world who was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God that raise him from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in God all right seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned in other words why heart the West you do love of the Brethren since you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever now the one thing I would say for you to do is in the next I don't know another week or two we're going on but sometimes in your studies in the scriptures I'll take the virtues write them down on a piece of paper lay them down the side of your Bible while you're reading and as you do note the times those words are used in the Bible well just to just write it down you know right faith virtue or knowledge just let it out side of your Bible then when you're reading because he says here are the unfeigned the love of the Brethren brotherly low okay see this do that it may help as we come along all right now we go to John to be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the last month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and all what a wonderful thing to be thinking about and I will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the Palma worm my great army which I sent among you you may be seated and as I always say when I read that scripture when it says my great army I sent among you now don't think about God sending the cankerworm Pama worm low the caterpillar you know he didn't send that he permitted that to come into being to test and try you and me it didn't come from him you have no way to bring those wrong things from Christ so I always mention that when I read that scripture because I want your thoughts to be in that line you say look at our God sent to can come war upon war and locals can know God permitted it wage is doing a wonderful job on the horse from riders and the things so stay with that part all right now I want to just review just a little bit tonight but then I have a thought I want to to put forth to you and I hope you've followed me up to the time to where we're at and what we're talking about now we've covered how that you know the church came into being we've covered how that on the day of Pentecost that as the church went forth that that church was God living in the people and all like that and bringing it down and that was his purpose to die that he could pay the price of our sin and I spent a lot of time emphasizing a lot of things that I hope will be very helpful once we proceed another message or so all right so don't get bored out in what I'm trying to say just listen and try to follow along because and to me it brings us to a lot of things you know it may not mean nothing to you but yet I believe it's dire and it's there for a reason for us to understand just like to be able to understand that on the day of Pentecost there was a hundred and twenty in the upper room that had been tutored for three and a half years right walk with the Lord Jesus and questioned him and he he you know he answered their questions and told him the parables and what they meant other than speaking a parable out here and then they would go privately and asked him questions and he would answer and explain those things unto that hundred and twenty they were tutored all right then when the Holy Ghost fell it put them to the position to where that they would be called the faith of the fathers are the Apostles faith faith revelation understanding we see then immediately you see an odd thing transpiring that you see a few hours later three thousand people receiving the Holy Ghost that had never heard all of this no tutoring no training no no that doesn't mean anything to you I mean to me it's like the difference in a college graduate in the first grader I mean that's what I would the way I look at it you know I mean the college graduates went through school to learn to get to a position and worthy of them and you are honor them for that within here comes somebody alone and remote he used to make a comical statement and he calling them third grade how they said third grade educational kids you know because that's what it is so you you you you go into school you know and and you go to school for a little while and it's all repetitive repetitive repetitive and you get over about the fourth grade and they say okay let's say our ABCs I've done that for four years yeah because it's come to find out whether you know them or not and probably listening to Ana and the way they teach probably a lot of kids it was would be in the fourth grade would not be able to recognize those letters meaning right as they are and they are in their mind ABCD Cody yeah that's it they didn't went through that song right you don't you don't get what I mean okay what I mean is one time those recite those disciples that were called it's toppled in apostles later all right there were followers until they become the ones who had the word within them as apostles okay they walked with the Lord Jesus for three and a half years right but those others only heard one sermon and got the Holy Ghost now are you going to say that this group got a Holy Ghost and this got this group got another Holy Ghost but one says there's not but one Holy Ghost no the Bible says one faith one Lord one baptism them all right see now there is the point of God degreeing our degree in ever how you use your terminology that things can be in this away brother branham I got a quote laying here to worry he said Martin Luther he said he had the baptism of the Holy Spirit mm-hmm whether you'd be surprised how many people this message wouldn't agree with that statement but he said Martin Luther had the baptism of the Holy Spirit all right that's off the message why I'm against organized religion in 1962 11:00 11:00 in the evening remember I believe that Martin Luther had the Holy Spirit absolutely maybe not in the portion it is today because it wasn't given out remember it was not the Holy Spirit that was eaten away in the ages it was the word but then as the word was eaten away the Holy Ghost could only work in the amount of word that the people had that's why this age would not be responsible for this age each one all right see then that away the Holy Ghost is it came on the 3,000 outside and brother Branham will state it and a lot of people say I don't see how brother Branham could say that that that they had the Holy Ghost just like on the day of Pentecost well if you just think on that Pentecost you had 3000 you had 120 120 the Holy Ghost gave them and if you're gonna call it brotherly kindness Holy Spirit but one said they had these virtues but they didn't how the headstone okay now you solve it with him with that 3,000 doubts I didn't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost as the faith of the father I've tried to express that over to you to get you to follow this just tonight of one thought all right every age then run instead I'll give it quotes in a minute you ought to know him he said ever age is the age of the Holy Ghost there's one whole section in the church age will cause the Holy Ghost in each age or something like that to go all right so you can't say well this group had the Holy Ghost but this group didn't have the Holy Ghost now how are you gonna say that now how are you gonna make him Hebrews 13:8 right all right now how are you gonna degree it then we'll get to it in a minute if I don't I'll just go through the Masons and free but around them on the future homie said he taught three processes all the way through they always talk to three processes just in case in case baptism the Holy Ghost he said he always talk to him for my boy said he said I never changed one out all right then that means what now how would you sisters like it if you had seven stages of a birth of a baby and this one has got to have it this away with the water blood spirit water bloating and all at once here comes one just gets with a water and they're here knowing your sister has got enough sense to know that ain't right I mean every baby's born unless it's a cesareans or something happening ever normal baby is what water blood and baby are life all right now see then that way that's the same way with ever Church age in other words are you thinking that Martin Luther only had justification now that was the age of justification Martin Luther had the new birth of that age but Reynolds says John Wesley added the new birth let's see new birth of Wesley under sanctification of sanctification the new birth well now if you're listening what I've been trying to bring and then I want to drop back all right now so bear with me this is your adult more understanding all right did Martin Luther just get the Holy Ghost without repenting is that what you're saying or was his holy ghost just repenting or what are you trying to say if you don't believe they have the new birth you see the point I'm trying to drive that if you'd like to get a little piece of paper laying in wagers it's the house where some of you already read it about the sister explaining some things they believe in the Philippines about the new birth I've told you brother branham said it was the most missed out was the baptism when the whole to go now you said well what do with it all right did you remember this quote that a random says if you don't know what you got how do you know whether you guys or not now I didn't make these statements have I become your enemies because I found the truth written in the message to express something see then it's been so missed out until people don't know we'll see this group said let's just believe this cuz then this group comes up it's believe what I got then it's all related comes in said to believe the Prophet and now look at all of the flings off but a random wasn't that confused then come on he wasn't that confused to bring out all these so there must be something wrong somewhere all right now but yet trying to get to the point see the church started out on the day of Pentecost and a wonderful position of the Holy Ghost falling upon those who had been tutored by the word the word himself was there with him and when the Holy Ghost failed look what it gave them a great understanding of the Holy Ghost they were chosen to write the word you don't see the three thousand and then chosen to write the word not if they didn't know a lot about God but you don't see it it's the ones that were of that original are either related to the original and understanding remember how we brought out the Apostle Paul he never stayed with them and listen to them he went to himself but he was a prophet he had to do it for that part and he came out preaching the same thing that Peter was preaching Peter was just called a statue a perfect man Paul was calling an adoption it's the same thing the same situations we'll get back to those later as we're trying to do but all right now what is the new birth well say well we were with the new birth is he's I shouted I've spoken to her I hope we're above all of that somebody asking you what is the new birth I hope we're to the point of where the Prophet said Christ the mystery of God revealed that the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you and he said owns the spoken word is regional see paragraph 1 51 that it's the birth of the word is Christ the work birth of the word is Christ let's see we take that now and we make it some hard thing to comprehend you know when the Prophet said on crisis of mystery of God revealed that he could be revealed to the most illiterate person a lot of don't believe that okay you're an unbeliever is that far enough you're an unbeliever because I didn't say that your prophet is the one that said down huh see to the most illiterate person they can be saved will see the most illiterate person didn't have all the understanding the Apostle that are you getting the difference between 120 and a 3,000 why would Paul come along and call them babes why would Peter call them babes desiring the sincere milk is worth who's he talking to we'll get to it in in the message in another message or so verse of like precious faith Peter wasn't writing the Bible Bibles not written to sinner's he's written to Christians sinners can only read it and I realize they're sinners are lost what's do we get through that I didn't men in them but listen the word made alive is the new birth each age the Prophet said had an amount of word to that age do you agree alright now and see the Holy Ghost quickening that word to that age would give the birth of the word to that age in each age as the birth of the word see that puts you back into the scripture in Matthew 13 36 through 39 where it says that the Son of Man is the sower of the seed there's no new birth without the son of man so in the seed all right then the Holy Ghost can quicken what he sowed Holy Ghost can't quicken it if it's not so damned see then he says the children of the kingdom are the children of God right and he said the children of the wicked one are the children of the devil all right you know but the son of man is the sower of the seed he preached the word the Holy Ghost made it alive and there's the new birth is not as what I got it I just got it I just I just accepted it see that's what we've come to we've come to shake hands we've come to a point and it went from one extreme to the other one just what do you believe that yeah okay you're safe in the other road you believe it yeah but you ain't smoking tongues yet you see what I'm getting at you going this way you caught that away then where's the truth each one had truth the words the truth if you were asked to explain the new birth what would you say if somebody came to you and said what must I do to be saved you know what brother Ron said we'd tell them what not to do what to quit and if that in the other said they didn't ask that question they would tell them about a book of rules or something or something to do right well that would put the new birth into some kind of a way of it trying to figure it out that's why I've read that scripture in Peter because he's talking about you were not redeemed what I would Peter talk about that you are not redeemed with corruptible things of life why would he mention that we don't say well let's throw this out I throw that no that's what it looks like but no he's talking about that she wasn't redeemed by these corruptible things or doctrines or ideas because you can't be redeemed that away it's got to be a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you then I ran them on to Smyrna Church age every age and the age of the age of the Holy Ghost to the true believer every age ever born-again believer now let's get that point ever born to getting believer whether it be Ephesus all the way to the lady of sila ever born-again believer is born again the same way right I mean that shouldn't be something that you well I don't think that's right well my lord what have you got it make it something that can be our cousin brother Branham we've been through those things right that's why I've been through what did he say the evidence of the Holy Ghost was in every age evidence of the Holy Ghost never changed one age the new bird never changed when one age until the evidence of the Holy Ghost has always been whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word right okay see then you putting it on to the basis the word you got something that you can anchor down to he said yeah but we got no I've got some quotes in your minute I'll get to it in time better run said we got the same Holy Ghost that they had on the day of Pentecost hey you like this one he said we got the same Holy Ghost it let Abraham hey like that one cuz Abel one Holy Ghost he ain't saying that way bruh ham had the new birth he's not explaining something like that that's the confusion when you get into the statue of a perfect man you'll be talking about patience and they say look here they ground that patience Abraham had to invert you don't tell me dad you're virtuous no that's not that's not what he's talking about but that's where we're reading it all right see the Holy Ghost then would have to be the same in each age or he would not be Hebrews 13:8 in being that being Hebrews 13:8 and C or - no I got these written down in front of it the same Holy Ghost they fell onto that Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost to give you a new birth well yeah a lot of people don't have don't believe you have the new birth like the head on the dip in a college with it what have you got you got one age getting born-again and require justification same occasion the baptismal okay you come to another age and you just required justification or maybe move up to the next when you required justification sanctification that's what it sounds like because the Prophet will bring it down to this is the age of the full restoration of the baptism of the Holy Ghost like the day of Pentecost but Church think about it the one thing that is the most important thing in the world is whether or not you're born again yet look at the confusions about that thought there's been made everything in the book to call it the new birth well then if it's that for you now it would be the same for Luther or Wesley a pentacle you see that's what I'm trying to get us to see if God is the same the Holy Ghost is the sign it was never eaten down it was never eaten away in the church ages the word was what was it eaten away and it never went all the way remember went down to the roots and it started coming back out and Luther Wesley Pentecost the brother branham could be so much to try to explain he would explain Luther in one message as a reformer explain him in another message as a prophet explain him as the church age bastard explain him as working in justification to bring forward restoration as if we look at it we just take which one we won't but that's what I want you to get if you don't get nothing out of anything tonight I want you to get one time the new birth in every age has been the same ever natural birth of a baby natural birth nothing ever natural birth of a baby is the same it might be a little difference in the happenings of this or that or the other are a little quicker in some situation are some kind of a thing but it's the same thing water breaks blood comes baby well my wife she just bypassed all them she did no she didn't bypass none of it well right then there's no way to bypass the baptism when the whole to go so you're gonna have to say the Holy Ghost was the same in every age it was the way people believed was what made the difference Martin Luther had the baptism of the Holy Ghost sure maybe not locking the next age because more is required but it was still the baptism it was still the new birth are you with me you can't make it to baptism in one age and something else in another age and call him Hebrews 13:8 you've got to have it at least leave it to her that you can understand that the new birth on the depth Pentecost was eternal life in the soul of mankind the new birth in Martin Luther's age was a baptism of the Holy Ghost eternal life into your soul church I face that for all of because I've heard people stand right here and try to explain the Luthor name didn't how the holding us even to the Zeus the streets didn't have the baptism of the holy God and I've told a man personally the one I'm talking about I told him personally gave him the quotes we were down the gills with eating he came right here that night and preached and preached that Azusa streets was false but everybody's gonna listen to him but you see one that I have to believe one thing if God is God he's the same and whatever call he he required for one to be born again he required the same for another the age has changed remember this quote the age has changed well God don't change the age would change to the age of justification and be an unfulfilled age or not a complete age Wesley would be sanctification to bring it to another stage the baptism of the Holy Ghost on Azusa Street another stage amen but it was still the baptism went on to go well did Luther get it just about what what did he get let me just make a few statements here they don't want to preach much on my heart according to the message and he'll have to pull them up your to know it they can if they want to according to the message of the future home the prophet of God said that he always talked three stages what was those three stages justification sanctification the baptism when the Holy Ghost the three stages now you're regardless of what we believe you're going to have to say that anybody that if one got it that way everybody gets it that way right if one got it that way everybody gets it that way or what are you gonna try to make it degree it here degree at Dhahran to the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the baptism when the Holy Ghost all right so the Prophet starts out on the future home then he starts explaining if you'll go to about page 15 and start with him he explains what happens at justification he explains that justification chops off your pie sins says nothing he says does nothing to the future or anything does it just chopped off your pie stems so look what you have if you got Luther with this justification you'd have him with his chopped off sins but that's all you don't have he says what calls you to do what you're doing it's still there he said it was the old root of evil and he says now that goes out and sanctification is the old root of evil goes out of the individual all right but that leaves you to where you don't have the new birth all right then that unclean spirit has the ability if you don't keep him pushed away to come back and then dwell you again and the state of you is seven times work that's what Jesus said about the unclean spirit he said we're brother day or the reason I don't like you and the way you make things too complicated I'll make it too simple that's what makes it complicated because I try to make it what that prophet did but you're not going to go home and take the future home and read to see if the prophet said it well yet you're gonna set there and condemn everything I say or write on the internet you don't even have enough human respect so I'm gonna tell you you ain't born again so don't start that with me I don't play no games if you ain't interested enough in your soul to be able to go and check out what it said then you're not interesting your soul okay then we'll try to drop that part and leave it laying right there cuz that's how Stern I stand on it you see just because Luther taught the just shall live by faith that wasn't all he talked he had a new birth for that age in time Wesley had a new birth of his age in time Azusa Street new birth but none of them had to fight for the father why because it had been eating away then there was no restoration so I've brought the church up in what I've tried to bring you and brought you up even into higher depths without knowing I was going to do exactly what I want to do tonight then is to drop back in the most simplicity of the gospel to try to make it so simple if the children will listen and adults will listen you won't be confused about the new birth you will see whether you've been through it or whether you've not been through it so let's get all that thoughts out of our mind to whether or not this or that or the other and remember every age is the age of the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the individual of that age every age had to sign evidence which was to believe the Word of God there was preached to that age now what you think about it cuz see most of time I said we we say well explain a new birth well you need to be justified you need to be sanctified need to be filled with the Holy Ghost and you're talking to children to try to tell them how to be born again how can I twelve-year-old child understand justification they don't know what it is sanctification they don't understand the terminologies yet we think we've explained it and I'm just as guilty as all the other ministers thinking we've made it simple enough by reading what brother branham say it happens at justification the unclean knew you repented covered your pie sins sanctification and the unclean spirit going out and the baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ coming to live we think that explains that but does it let's drop down to not for a few minutes and to just think about a new birth they'll be tied up with all of the thoughts and situations you know just think about it now said a child comes up and they say I want to be saved well what you need to do you need to be justified you need to be sanctified need be filled with Holy Ghost and they're looking at you saying what in the world are you talking about would that not be the basics of why that most of us would approach him you know you can't even approach the door you know approach adults with that form until you come in this message you didn't know very much about justification did you very little about sanctification you know you knew about baptism of the Holy Ghost was I believe God and I got it I'm saved come on what happens to an individual then we're back here trying my best to stay right here tonight faith trying to stay with the thoughts of the 3,000 that heard one message and received the baptism in the Holy Ghost eternal life read the message they heard in the book of life radiant it's dire Peter describes what this is about and what that is what happened what took place and how the Lord Jesus done this and this happened to them and then you say what you need to do you need me justified now you get justified will get you sanctified what happened on the day of Pentecost to me the same thing had happened on to their Pentecost it's the same thing that happened to ever person this day that truly has the baptism of the Holy Spirit those people realized I'm asking you to return Acts they realized that these people had something they saw the evidence of it they saw them running out and speaking in tongues and the things you want to call it but we know it's all in the upper room but that's alright you can argue points and then you'll just miss everything I'm talking about they were not in the upper room they were not there to experience all of those things what they saw people that something that happened they didn't know everyone I might be in their home late make up but probably a lot of them knew him and they knew that they had fathered this man for three and a half years they knew that he was an odd person and and brought some hot dogs but they believed him he taught him the miracles and the ways nothing and they saw him see to those standing by when those people came out of that room they knew that a day or two before then they were all running for their lives that they were scared to death they were hiding right now they see them that they're out trying to tell the world what had happened in their lives now what are those people then they looked at that and they said well I'd like to have one what you got minute brother and what can we do how can we get what you got he's repeating every one haven't be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost repentance was required there's where you start do you think about justification I think about repentance and we can use the terminologies of justification and the things I think about repentance I think in the language these children think of that we heard a gospel preached we heard somebody talking to us mama daddy brother sister preacher teacher whatever you know what you get what I mean we heard them talking about Jesus Christ and that brought us to a point of what we call conviction into our hearts our thoughts that we wanted what they had everybody Luther ever who would have to first face God that way one to face him as a point that he brings to your thinking that you need to be saved children I'm not against all of these things of all the people of the message anyway to get somebody saved to me is wonderful I don't care if you call it standing on your head try to get it done as long as it's done I don't care if it's the devil preaching it as long as you get saved see then it starts what the new birth start you remember in the message your new birth starts by you believing you see why it's so important what you do believe that's vital well you start out believing everybody started out believing so men that helped along the way of different things but it's still the same thing Martin Luther had to realize he was lost and see that's what the gospel is supposed to bring us to a realization that we need to be saved in preaching that Jesus Christ came that's what I'm asking you go back and read before the Holy Ghost came read that in the acts 1 2 3 run through the read that and see what was explained to them that they were lost and doomed and they needed salvation and that Jesus Christ had come and paid the price and what you're seeing now is the after-effects of us believing it and accepting him as our Savior and then this story won't into children God will start dealing with you someday when you reach what's called the age of accountability and we don't determine by anybody in that is that is personally between you and God you may be 50 years old and finally realize that you're lost it's not the age factor but it's the point of realizing that you need to be saved that you need salvation the church I'm explaining the best that I can and terminology is whatever born-again believer goes through now if you can tell me shortcuts I'd like to know him but I've never found any you know shortcuts in the gospel and God don't have this away and then he has a better way over here or somebody to do it if he did he done wrong start with I'm quoting your prophet so it starts by realizing and he realized that starts by the scripture being perfect in what it is then no man could come to the Father the volume and no salvation outside of believing that Jesus Christ was Almighty God he see why it's so important the truth the Prophet said false prophets bring false birth these are the true prophets bring troopers believing on the Lord Jesus Christ are realizing see him calling you do you realize what that means children think about it if somebody's a preaching what it does you get to thinking about yourself and you get to thinking about well am i saved or no no maybe this ought to be for the adults also but no never you ought to think about it you might realize you hadn't been through some of these things you see I'm explaining the new bird from every form of each age and for all ages and my own experience meeting God when I was 12 years old but yet I could not go to him because I didn't know how to get there how could I explain to people in that church of what I saw when they didn't believe in the real God he's being real they believed in shouting doing this kind of they never had any thoughts I ain't saying that about everybody now trying to be honest where do you think they had thoughts about God being real enough that he would appear to you you realized that him calling you to come to him come in in dealing we just letting you know that he loves you in dealing with you in your heart and making you feel burr you know burdened because that your doing wrong things that you're not following I've to him in walking in the light of his love and just realizing that God is real why would you want to reap the end if he wouldn't real what is it repeat about if God's not real let's see I'm just asking you how many adults in here as ever went through and could follow that God began to deal with me and I repented and I asked him to come and cleanse me up and take away the things that I was doing and then to come to a place in your heart and life that you could realize that God has not just been dealing with you he has caused something to happen within you that is now carrying you back to him could you see the first you got to realize he's calling you you can't come if he ain't calling you no maniac off your chosen so we go through all of that but that ain't got nothing to do with it the truth of it is I want to believe we're all chosen don't you all right see repentance of our sins and saying God I'm sorry I'm sorry for that I told you as us as a sinner before I become to the Lord that I would do things wrong in life and when I come to the quietness in time overnight I would say God I'm sorry I never knew about how to try to talk to him as Jesus or who he was the second person of the Trinity or the third rate to the tenth I just believed God was real cuz I've seen him there was no way you could explain that what I saw is not being real and I've tried to preach the gospel to you children the same way God will speak to you if you'll just listen see we're going all over terminology but God only faced our prophet you see why we killed a new birth and in the hearts and the lives of the people God will speak to you and talk to you and he'll tell you that you need to be saved and this is one way that I know for sure of a lot of things I've tried to explain this to people you know that after you've repented of your sins and accepted him as your Savior he'll never tell you that you're lost you'll say you don't have enough you need a whole lot more but he'll never tell you you lost so when you turn to God and you start seeing God in the correct way and voices starts telling you that you're lost just say devil get on out of here and leave me alone because God ain't gonna tell because you're never gonna be lost if you repented I didn't say you're saved I didn't say you had eternal life I didn't say anything about it and I said you'll never face God with those sins if you repent enough they're putting the seal forgetting all this and gone yeah but brother Dale I don't know if I've done that honor you mean there's so got something that God can't cleanse all right so you repent of your sins and you say Father forgive me forgive me Lord chop of my past don't try to repent for what somebody else done I'm quoting the Prophet right you repent for what you've done now watch somebody else done he said don't even try to repent for what Adam done he said cause you didn't do it Adams weren't doing that Adam was one that needed to repent for his it's you and me realizing yes Lord I've done wrong I need salvation you Father amen water baptism because that's the next step you go to the water and you get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for showing who you're following and what's taking place showing your repentance I'm quoting vertebra your repentance is genuine if you go follow him in that that way because the church that's the only thing your kids that's the only thing you can do and we you you can't do nothing but repent and then go and get baptized he doesn't give you a book of rules to live by that's what we've taught that has turned out to be no then you come to the second stage of your journey which is called sanctification what a sanctification means simply to you children's language what is it simple they mean to be sanctified it simply means that within your life something has happened within you that it's made you realize that you're doing wrong do you know you don't repeat it if you sin you said well I realize I wrong repented right but that never stops never think it stops anywhere in your life of you thinking about the wrong it'll never stop because it'll go with everything then you simply ask God to say Lord take away these things that I'm doing with our sanctification now sanctification is not a book of rules to live by well I've done this not done that now what else you want me to do don't worry about it just repent of your sins and follow him then you'll see something will start changing ahead and say it's born again now come on listen you see something start changing you know that the prophet of God teaches that sanctification you can even get a new nature you remember in Ezekiel you remember in Ezekiel Ezekiel covers it real well don't he I'll give you a new heart the new spirit and prophet said that's not the holy spirit he said something new spirit the repentance cleanses you sanctification brings you new desires new thoughts you start wanting to go to church and many of you have noticed and children listen how many of you have noticed adults that start out doing real good and they start going to church and doing that the night a while you see them gradually falling off and they get where they don't come they don't want to serve the Lord come on children and if he wants to happen how bad it is for us adults who do those things it takes to it it's the sanctification that's where Jesus said the unclean spirit goes out of a man brother Brown says you get new desires new thoughts you want to go to church you want to do right you want to repent of your sins you want to live right that's sanctification that's where most people stop it and think that is the new birth but that's not what it is sanctification is just picking up you've heard the Prophet talk about you see AG lice out in the yard you pick it up as justification you got a reason for it you don't take it fill it full of water and start drinking you take it in the house and you wash it then you boil it you cleanse it a sanctification C then you can put something in it and you drink it see children you start realizing and I shouldn't do these things I shouldn't have these wrong thoughts I shouldn't say these things the come on children we even put it down in a natural way you realize what I'm talking about you reached an age about 10 11 12 years old you think the whole world can't run without you and you think mom and daddys the craziest people that there is in the world that one over in the corner shaking is there you begin to think look what I've done I've quit this I quit down I stop these things I don't do these so I must be saved don't stop don't stop there that's just that unclean spirit going out now if the unclean spirit goes out what are we supposed to do we're supposed to put something in place off now what can you put in place of don't don't try to talk about putting the baptism the whole goes there yet we got that far you start putting the word really you want plain language you know what drives the unclean spirit out of you is the words you've taken inhaled it's being the truth how well I remember those years that I walked in a place 18 years of age I went to the altar of Baptist Church of course we got everything we believed was safe I knew there's something wrong I couldn't get an answer because they didn't know my ass my questions I was so dedicated to God you know I've done everything I could do you see it here now I mean you need to vacuum floor I'll do it I don't worry about it clean the bathtub I mean in the bathrooms I don't care well I was so dedicated from the time I was 18 years old to the church at 23 years old I was ordained a deacon wound up teaching the adult classes which was the Deacons and elders and their wives because I had that zeal see don't let that seal eat you up they lead up your wisdom the scripture says wait on God I had no one to be able to help me to go any further because they knew no father do they would have been glad to put me in preaching or anything but I'm just trying to tell you own personal experience we don't go hard to do things you repented of your sins you've asked him to forgive you you've asked him to cleanse you up there's you've great words we use sanctification or some you know this you don't it simply means just cleaning you up you stop thinking the wrong thoughts something starts happening within you why because the unclean has gone out and God is trying his best to come in and he's coming in by the word that you're hearing the words you hearing is what's driving him out and the words you're hearing is what's keeping him driven out but you know yourself your prophet when he told her noted ones to the adults when he got into anointed ones what to do those people that come to sanctification were perfect examples for the anointed ones because they said we've done this we've done that we've done over we've done everything but why didn't they get born again they got enough to get an anointing but not enough to get a birth now I'm simply trying to explain one time what is the new birth the new birth is the birth of the word you take the word and you hold it and then the Holy Ghost comes down and quickens it now is that right in the Gospels there's three things the disciple drove one of them said understand it one of them kept it I believe it's the word and in Oh Joe held it it's like three things that he's explaining in the parables how that those disciples in those parables of the the you know the word being planted the the things happening the kingdom the children of the kingdom and thought and look at those disciples three and a half years three nine years they listened to the Lord Jesus talking about the word and what was happening all that time what was happening all that time that unclean spirit was being driven out they were taking God at His Word until the scripture says finally he said do you not believe they said we believe that thou hast the words of eternal we believe the ain't no horse to they had got to a place that they believed but they were only sanctified I'm saying that to the children don't get so caught up with it that you think I done this and done that that I've got it always see God there's not a day in my life that I don't pray God save me you don't pray for God to save you know I've already said why would you not cry out to be saved what I've already saved I say nice things don't worry about it you got that thought you ain't saved no come on adults don't try to fight me with words and thoughts listen why would you not call out to God god save me God deliver me this man that I live within he's not a view yet you know this one that's inside of me is you but the one outside through my body my spirit it's not of you now have turmoil I have Fighting's and things if you don't believe that go to power where he said things that would not I do think I do it would not be said if it's not that he said it's not me that do it he says that one is with this within the he's ones holding with this outside man he serves the law of the flesh now I'm paraphrasing the scripture but is right the children listen never stop seeking God adults never stop seeking God never stopped crying out unto Him never stop telling him it's you loving ain't a prayer that I make that I don't say Lord I love you I've been ridiculed for putting my hands up we're saying I love you and I told God every time I raised my hand I want you to know Lord then I love you people say oh that's the other thing there's other signs but are you going to tell me that that's not the International world-known language of I love you we're each way you started whatever you want to go it means I love you you telling me to all them people that hold our hand up like that oh that's really the devil cuz it but I'll tell you just like I told the brother that Minister brother they said something to me about it he said they're seeing you out on the Internet I said what about when they see you and you do that he said what do you mean I said that's the Pope's conquering piece he's conquering and I said you do it every time you preach well he draw that and he never mentioned that again well I didn't want to tell him that way but that's where it was he's standing right here in breach and he go and that's what that Pope is saying I'm dividing even conquering you I'm taking over the land as you say children have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior have you asked him to cleanse you and forgive you do you ask him daily to forgive you of the things you do have you asked him to come and live in your heart because remember the Prophet said it's not whether or not you accept him he said it's whether or not he accepts you and you know what he's not going to accept you if you're not seeing your wine that's sensible well I've accepted Jesus Christ my Savior as he accepted you well what do you mean that's all I can do amen all Abraham could do was believe God hey man but what did God do for Abraham he circumcised him come on have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior said Lord saved me now Lord cleanse me and let me listen to the word instead of listening to all this other garbage on the tapes and your doings and their thing have you listened to God in His Word remember the way you raise those children folks is the way they shall be but has he accepted you well what do you mean I quit this and I quit that I repented and I quit doing this time and I'd love to go to church and I love the Lord and his word that's ever been at the word sanctification you didn't receive the new birth yet because the new birth you how something now listen carefully adults to you have something to do with justification because you've repented of your sins you have something to do with sanctification because you have took the word and held it and held on to that word and let that word cleanse you from the things of cutting your hair painting your face wearing your pants or men wearing longer exactly whatever doing but has he ever accepted you what do you mean brother day when he gives you the baptism when the Holy Ghost is when he accepts you are you listening when he gives you the baptism of the Holy Spirit that is him accepting you that is him prior phrasing that would using it like the Lord Jesus pleased to dwell when he gave you the new birth he's pleased to dwell in you well brother how do I know I got the new birth watch the word from then on and see which you took out of my thoughts because you've covered sanctification as being where we get new thoughts and new ideas and you what do we get it to new birth we get the person listen we hit something inside that can tell us what's outside and tell us what from inside of us coming outside needs to get out right is any better way of explaining new birth and that he comes to live inside of you and give you eternal life in your soul and then surely you got something on your side to fight the battle you got somebody to help you then it's not just quitting there some quitting that it's whether or not Jesus Christ has come and lived in your life it's whether or not he has accepted you he's accepted you you give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then he'll never turn you down you remember that scripture or there's an Old Testament blessed is either I don't know and prove is not seeing David you know you realize there's a person that God doesn't impute sin to no that's not cuz I so good first off God don't impute where you hold your sins and won't repent all right I mean impute and righteousness to you at that time you don't impute that sanctification in the basis of trying to do this right when you receive the baptism when the Holy Ghost I can find this with the Prophet only the one who has the new birth can fit David and what he said only the person who has the new birth the born-again experience the eternal I can fit what David said unless it is a man to whom God will not impute sin brother Branham said he will not impute sin over the token so if you want to get to the place where sin is not imputed until you get born again you're born again because that's the person he's talking about he won't impute e impute to all the rest god he keeps records but when you get that new birth now remember now here's where we go you say well you mean to tell me when we get the new birth we can just go out and start doing wrong now you're not listening we covered that at sanctification sanctification was supposed to took away all them wrong desires sanctification are you going to ever get to the basis brother Dale that you don't have no wrong thoughts ain't never said I would they never thought I would and I'll quote your prophet he said we'll be a sticker too we were challenged well I it don't matter about me being a sticker now he didn't say that he said you won't be a sticker when you've met when you're changed until then you're a human being that is a body and a spirit that is still of this worldly night with that soul inside of there there's the only thing that don't see the man that don't see there's one God don't impute what have you done wrong do it every day you know quotes your prophet but random do you see any said over day is that right he said I seen every day what cause it was human Paul you seen things I would not I do not the things I do not it would not he said then if I do these things it's not neither do it with this outside man he said he's gonna serve the law of the flesh and he said I've served the inward man which is from Christ that's perforation but that's Paul what is it Romans you realize Church then the young people listen to me for men and adults don't get so peed off hot at me as to me try to help your children do you I believe in emotional things there's not an emotional person in this building as emotional as this person is but you never know it never see it because it's something within me we're talking today about it we pray at night before we go to bed nice thing we prayed I get up crawl over cross the bed kids my wife cannot say I love you I don't in my prayin the reason I can go to sleep in the hurry is when I was turned back over I start talking to it I started praying the Bible says pray without ceasing and how can you do that it just means you just taking an attitude of priorities right you stay in an attitude of prayer you can go all day long and you ain't bowed your head and you ain't said amen you simply been talking to God I thought I had to get down pray do brother random thoughts I'm fine do I need to do it this way do it that way didn't you know he was like he said about his hands or someone yeah it's just believing in God is real see if you don't believe God is real then you can't realize that that God is talking to you and you'll think it's just mama condemn me for doing this her daddy told me is wrong to do this and I don't want to do it children that's wonderful that's father and mother of leadership that's wonderful that's you following them less children that's wonderful that's commendable but that's not salvation salvation is not cause you cried shouted but it's win you cried and shouted because of what happened in your life when you begin to realize there's something different you begin to realize that something happened with inside of me it's not just in my body in my spirit but something in my very nature in being is crying out for God salvation the same forever age now listen if you listened with that approach I'm talking about what I've said not the wordings I've used and the thoughts go that I'm saying with the approach that I've tried to make that way would show the new birth is for everybody the sign that's what I've tried to do to show you the new birth is for everybody the same whether it be children whether it be adults whether it be grandmas and grandpas or who it is salvations are saying gods I'm repeating it so give God calling you and speaking to you calling you to himself and you realizing God is real and no something's talking to you then you say to simply the God you don't want to tell everybody the world about you just simply say to God Lord I love you save me Lord I need for you to come down and save me accept me is your child I take away the MOL desires and I listen children you can listen to these old folks talk all you want and they'll tell you how they had no problems that they've been a Christian 50 years and they ain't had no troubles and ain't had no heartaches and no problems now you're not doing it but they're lying to the that's dishonest I can make it don't call them liars okay but they're not telling you the truth because brother branham emphatic that's what I call one thing that a man in the great position he was in the yet he was so humble and so repented and so to God that he loved God brother Perry Greene told it one time down in Atlanta believe what he said brother Branham told him said brother Perry said when you get in touch with him talking to it he said you tell him I love him he wanted God to know he loved him you ever seen a man that was built the way he was built ain't none of us know neither trying lingo me not yet you know what we can strive for it does that mean we throw up our hands and quit no we strive for it we seek after God and try to find him we try to teach our children and that's why it's so important for you to teach your children teach them at home to pray and to serve God but listen church if I'm wrong I'm sorry but don't scare your children with the gospel now this is mom and daddy I'm talking to for me don't try to scare your children into being safe you'll run them away from God don't try to scare them don't tell them God don't want you do that don't you tell them I don't want you to you ain't man enough or woman enough to say it I don't want you to do that because I didn't live in a good life see you're saying God don't want you you're making them afraid of God you're making a fear come upon them you don't realize it you're going the opposite direction live before them the example of Christ and say lord help the children what a wonderful thing it is to know the truth because now listen what I'm saying you can argue in fuss all you want to but to know a simple form of salvation that would save everybody in the world and that's not a hard thing to do nothing I've explained tonight would be something hard for you to do all I ask you to do is realize you're lost repent of your sins and ask God to forgive you follow him in water baptism start going to church and being good reading your Bible the prophets message studying it letting that come in to you and cleanse you I walked in that after coming in this message for two years do I claim salvation I was 18 years old I've seen a lot of things happening of God but when I heard that prophet explaining the new birth I knew I didn't have it and I began to seek Him and say Lord what is it he was guiding me to himself through the opening of the word and he'll do that if you'll just keep reading and praying but then he'll come one day and he'll accept you and when he does you'll know where you're at musicians you'll know where you're at and where you standing you'll see this thing starts happening it's a whole lot different don't expect it to be something like we've tried to explain to you where brother Allen said to the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ well what I need to read read the message read the Bible listen to everything you can yes but I can't give you a certain book to read what you need to do you need to get into please ask these and read the whole thing and you'll find out you saved know you might find out you're lost that's right you might wind up and find out you're lost pray out to God and to seek Him cause when he accepts you you let you know it well I speak in tongues and cria whatever God wants you to do whatever he wants you to do your doing brother Ron said everybody's not natured to sign he said if you've never spoke in tongues listen if I can quote this he said if you've never spoke in tongue he said lay before the spout long enough and God let you come through speaking something to that that's pretty close because you see he explained it like there some people have to have things to hold onto right some people have to have something to hold onto some people can just take it like it is and stand by the some has to have things to hold them to you know what he's a good card he'll do that let's stand together see we're talking about the new birth now we'll start Lord willing Sunday start going up the Statue of a perfect man because the basis of all evidence whether you're born again or not you're not born again is no need of trying to start till we get to that what we got
