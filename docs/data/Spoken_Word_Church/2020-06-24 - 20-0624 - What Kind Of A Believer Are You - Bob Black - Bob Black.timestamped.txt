[1:24] well I want to echo brother some of the
[1:27] things we said on Sunday about how much
[1:29] we enjoyed the Father's Day trip and
[1:31] everything and
[1:38] and just enjoy and spin this it's a good
[1:41] time of fellowship with everybody
[1:42] talking to listening and and I tell you
[1:46] we've got with what some of the
[1:48] old-timers in here we've got so much
[1:49] information and knowledge in here if we
[1:51] could just kind of get it in a book we'd
[1:52] have something
[1:54] sometimes it's just good to sit around
[1:56] and listen and get some good fellowship
[1:58] in and everything but I tell you
[2:02] love this little group is I think we got
[2:05] to talking about the ministers and
[2:06] things and aside I said I just I'm just
[2:09] glad I get to rub shoulders with this
[2:10] group right not just the ministers but
[2:13] all of you I just really appreciate you
[2:15] and everything so anyway let's tonight
[2:20] I'm gonna look into the The Book of Luke
[2:22] chapter 17 and book of Genesis chapter
[2:25] 18 and we're gonna just take a little
[2:28] thought that I've kind of been
[2:30] meditating on for a few weeks now
[2:32] let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[2:35] well God as we gather together Lord
[2:37] Jesus I pray God that you'll make this
[2:38] night not a night of just vain worship
[2:41] Lord but a night of coming together to
[2:43] look into the mirror of your word to see
[2:45] the day and our that we're living in to
[2:47] see something about ourselves Lord we
[2:50] know that the churches is a is a place
[2:53] of Correction Lord God and we pray Lord
[2:55] that maybe something the night would be
[2:56] said to help us examine ourselves a
[2:58] little bit closer look our to see how we
[3:01] measure up with your word Lord God grant
[3:04] us that you'll give us something Lord to
[3:05] become a little bit closer to that final
[3:07] masterpiece that you're molding us into
[3:09] Lord that we is required of us so that
[3:12] we can take a body change so that we can
[3:14] get out of here we asked o God that your
[3:16] spirit will be made welcome here tonight
[3:18] little Col that you'll just come amongst
[3:19] us and and move amongst the pews and
[3:21] amongst the hours Lord Jesus 30 the
[3:23] angels of your heavenly host will be
[3:25] feel feel welcomed it's just coming
[3:27] among us Lord and rub shoulders with us
[3:30] Lord tonight we pray we ask these things
[3:32] these blessings upon your people in your
[3:34] name Amen
[3:37] so let's just start reading in Luke
[3:40] chapter 17 verses 28 and 32 and it says
[3:43] likewise also as it was in the days of
[3:46] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[3:48] they sold they planted their building
[3:51] sounds like things were just kind of
[3:53] going along
[3:54] they they were doing things they were
[3:56] just kind of like we are building
[3:59] building stuff selling stuff but the
[4:02] same day light went out of Sodom it
[4:03] rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[4:05] and destroyed them all
[4:07] even the shall it be in the day where
[4:09] the Son of Man is revealed in other
[4:12] words it's gonna be just like that does
[4:13] seem like everything's just going along
[4:15] stuffs happening nothing anything
[4:18] to be you know shocked at or anything
[4:21] and it says in that day he would shall
[4:23] be upon the housetop and his stuff in
[4:25] the in the house let him not come down
[4:27] to take it away and he that is in the
[4:28] field let him likewise not return back
[4:32] remember Lot's wife so something
[4:35] interesting about that that scene where
[4:38] Abraham and Laden all that's going on
[4:40] back then so let's turn to turn over to
[4:42] Genesis chapter 18 verses 1 to 5 and and
[4:45] read what it says back in the Old
[4:47] Testament
[4:48] and it says and the Lord appeared unto
[4:51] him and the plains of Mamre and he said
[4:53] in the tent door in the heat of the day
[4:54] my kind of picture that in your mind
[4:57] it's hot maybe a little bit miserable
[4:59] they didn't have deodorant back then you
[5:01] know just kind of get it get center
[5:05] stage a little bit and here comes three
[5:07] me and come walking up and he lifts up
[5:10] his eyes and looked and lo three men
[5:12] stood by him and when he saw them he ran
[5:15] to meet them from the tent door and
[5:16] bowed himself toward the ground and said
[5:19] my lord if now I found favor in thy
[5:22] sight pass not away I pray thee from thy
[5:24] servant a little little water I pray you
[5:26] be fetched and wash your feet and rest
[5:28] yourselves under the tree and I will
[5:31] fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye
[5:33] your hearts after that ye shall pass on
[5:35] for therefore are you coming to your
[5:37] servant and they said
[5:39] so do as thou I said you may be seated
[5:43] the Lord had his blessing to the reading
[5:44] of the word
[5:46] now I know we've heard many many times
[5:49] preached on that
[5:58] many times wouldn't preach on this
[6:00] scripture we talked about that how
[6:02] Abraham recognized he did not recognize
[6:04] a Trinity but he recognized one God he
[6:07] knew the person that he hadn't met years
[6:09] ago and after he'd fought that to go
[6:12] rescue a lot and he recognized because
[6:14] he had a revelation of who God was and
[6:16] he knew who he was talking to and so he
[6:18] he looked and he saw one coming the one
[6:21] that he wanted to speak to but tonight I
[6:24] want to talk not just about that one but
[6:27] about all three because there was a
[6:29] purpose behind all three coming and
[6:31] maybe tonight I want to take the topic
[6:33] of because it was each one of those
[6:36] people that came just to each one of
[6:38] those messengers there was a messenger
[6:40] for Abraham and two messages that went
[6:42] down to two lot they all came with a
[6:45] purpose to address a situation to
[6:47] address a specific category of people
[6:50] that that were there in that particular
[6:52] time period
[6:53] and so you see the same thing is
[6:56] happening today and so tonight I want to
[6:58] take a topic of what kind of believer
[7:00] argued because those three messengers
[7:03] came to address three different
[7:05] categories of people and so let me just
[7:08] read a quote would kind of set the stage
[7:10] here and brother Brown said in it it
[7:12] become with us to fulfill all
[7:13] righteousness he said all right what was
[7:16] it in the days of law was signed it
[7:18] again there was three classes of people
[7:21] in the days of lot was that right that
[7:23] was the unbeliever that make believer
[7:24] and the believer each one of them
[7:26] received a messenger that's right when
[7:28] Abraham was sitting under his though
[7:30] what taking place look what taking place
[7:32] there was an angel came down and went
[7:34] down into Sodom this man went down there
[7:37] and taught we're pennis to them that
[7:39] they should repent and turn to God what
[7:41] happened only three came out lot and his
[7:43] two daughters his wife turned to a
[7:45] pillar of salt only three came out when
[7:47] there was a modern Billy Graham who shot
[7:49] the message down in there too and we see
[7:51] that happening today we see to the
[7:54] nominal Church we see a messenger going
[7:56] forth preaching so we see there's three
[7:59] categories of people now now
[8:01] historically maybe a lot of the older
[8:03] ones could look back at all the
[8:04] different times this kind of sermon has
[8:06] been preached in churches before and you
[8:07] know you can use ministers are many
[8:09] times almost use it to kind of beat
[8:11] people over the head with it I remember
[8:13] my parents might be listening in but I
[8:15] remember years ago they told me about
[8:17] whenever kind of coming up in the
[8:19] message they sat in a little church and
[8:21] and there was it was a very small church
[8:23] and it just happened to be the pastor
[8:24] the pastor's family and them that was
[8:27] all that was in there and the print the
[8:29] pastor began to preach about how he
[8:31] could smell out the goats and all this
[8:32] kind of stuff and he had began to look
[8:34] around his life there's nobody else here
[8:36] but just like one or two that belong to
[8:37] the pastor's family so yeah I don't
[8:41] believe that brother Branham preached
[8:42] his sermon I don't believe that he
[8:44] preached this to to kind of walk you
[8:46] over the head but I believe he preached
[8:48] it to to cause you to inspect yourself
[8:50] not so that we can inspect one another
[8:52] and look at underneath one another and
[8:54] say aha aha I think that you would make
[8:56] believer I think you're an unbeliever
[8:58] but so that you would and begin to
[9:01] realize maybe the the place that you are
[9:03] in your life and the category that you
[9:05] fall in because we may be maybe a little
[9:07] bit later on and this message we'll
[9:09] examine at the end of the message three
[9:11] kinds of believers when brother Branham
[9:12] was preaching that he began to to
[9:15] move the people's minds into identifying
[9:19] themselves with the category that they
[9:20] fit in now now if you want to look at
[9:23] maybe Abraham the the category of
[9:25] Abraham the category of the true
[9:27] believer first of all you got to realize
[9:29] that Abraham was on a journey and you're
[9:31] on the journey too and at the end of
[9:33] Abraham his journey he met he met this
[9:35] band God revealing himself in flesh he
[9:38] met himself he met this man at the end
[9:40] of his journey so so what's gonna happen
[9:42] to you at the end of your journey see -
[9:45] at the end of that message as I was
[9:47] saying brother Branham began to say if
[9:49] you want to identify yourself with any
[9:51] of these categories of people you got to
[9:53] look at these people that are in the
[9:54] Bible that played out these same
[9:56] scenarios you got to either look at
[9:58] Abraham a lot or the sodomize down there
[10:02] in Sodom or look at
[10:04] NASA
[10:06] they'll um or you got to look at Judas
[10:09] or all these different ones that played
[10:11] out all these different roles so so we
[10:14] want to look at what Abraham was and
[10:16] what it what it means to be a true
[10:18] believer first and find out if we fit
[10:20] ourselves if we can fit ourselves in
[10:22] that category because we want to find
[10:24] out what the difference is what's what's
[10:26] the difference between a real true
[10:28] believer and an unbeliever who thinks
[10:31] they're a believer and a make believer
[10:33] who's just hanging out what's the
[10:34] difference there's got to be some kind
[10:36] of some major difference
[10:38] now
[10:42] now I would say
[10:47] you know Abraham and his go on this
[10:50] journey he was a changed man from that
[10:52] from the when he began on his journey
[10:54] and we're all here to be changed and
[10:57] we're looking for the thing that will
[10:58] give us the tip will give us change and
[11:00] I believe the thing that will change us
[11:02] the things that is changing us is the
[11:04] new birth experience it is the opening
[11:06] of the word as it's being revealed to us
[11:08] and you see a lot of times when
[11:10] especially as you see the things going
[11:12] on in the world today we look for
[11:14] something else other than the word and
[11:17] maybe that's really what I'm majoring on
[11:18] tonight we start with what the real true
[11:21] believer is anchored in the Word of God
[11:23] so he's not going to be shaken when bad
[11:26] things come when bad things happen and
[11:29] so you know the danger of the make
[11:33] believer and the unbeliever and maybe a
[11:35] little believer even when he starts
[11:37] backsliding is to get his mind off of
[11:39] the word because anything off of the
[11:41] word is gonna start giving them a shaky
[11:43] foundation are you gonna start getting
[11:45] off of you're off of the thing that is
[11:47] gonna give you real power over the enemy
[11:50] and I say see we think a lot of times
[11:53] just kind of when you when you begin to
[11:54] talk to people you begin to think that
[11:56] the reason that you're put here honor
[11:58] the reason that Abraham was put here on
[12:00] earth the reason he was here put here on
[12:02] earth was to bring forth a nation and
[12:04] all of those kind of in other words to
[12:05] fulfill the Word of God I see your you
[12:09] were here on this earth to fulfill the
[12:10] Word of God also
[12:12] and you're you're not here necessarily
[12:15] to um you know maybe to just just kind
[12:18] of educate your children and and and and
[12:20] and put all kinds of false in their
[12:22] heads you're here to lead them to Christ
[12:25] to lead them to a born-again experience
[12:28] but we're not here to change the world
[12:30] by passing laws and and signing things
[12:32] into a you know all the commotion or
[12:34] everything about abortion and pedophilia
[12:36] and all that kind of thing those are
[12:37] things that we can get all worked up
[12:39] about but yet you are not sitting here
[12:41] in this earth to sign laws to change the
[12:43] world the you what your the way that God
[12:47] ordained way to change the earth is to
[12:50] is to preach the gospel for the gospel
[12:52] to be preached for people to believe it
[12:54] and for their lives to be changed that
[12:56] way but what one scripture that I like
[12:58] to quote over and over again is that
[13:00] scripture in Ecclesiastes that says
[13:02] there's you can't make every path
[13:03] straight so there's a lot of crooked
[13:06] paths that are straight in the world and
[13:07] you can't straighten everything out but
[13:09] what you can do is help others to see
[13:12] Jesus Christ show that they're changed
[13:13] and as more and more people are changed
[13:16] eventually the whole earth will be
[13:18] changed by the same process that you and
[13:20] I are being changed by going through
[13:22] justification sanctification and the
[13:24] baptism the Holy Ghost now kind of think
[13:26] about that as Abraham sitting there
[13:28] under that oak tree and and later
[13:30] looking down at Sodom and Gomorrah as
[13:31] these three men come up he didn't run
[13:34] down to Sodom and Gomorrah to go pass on
[13:35] all kind of laws and things and they go
[13:37] get stirred up with all the politics and
[13:39] everything and get all stirred up in
[13:40] that Avenue you know he wasn't concerned
[13:44] about who the president of Sodom and
[13:45] Gomorrah was or all that kind of stuff
[13:47] if you if you catch my meeting because
[13:49] you see that kind of stuff is not going
[13:52] to change anything if you have a good
[13:55] president for a while eventually a bad
[13:57] prisoner is going to come in if you have
[13:59] if you make if you sign some good laws
[14:01] eventually a bad law is gonna get signed
[14:03] and all kinds of things are going on
[14:05] behind the scenes that we don't even
[14:07] have any idea of but the thing that will
[14:09] change it will really affect good change
[14:12] the only could change is the new birth
[14:15] in our lives you see that's what we all
[14:18] need we we to be born again we need to
[14:21] be born again and I think sometimes we
[14:24] get in our in our heads that we kind of
[14:26] move move away from what it really means
[14:29] to be born again now we know in the Old
[14:31] Testament Abraham was not born again
[14:33] because the the sacrifice the sacrifice
[14:35] of that day their life could not come
[14:37] back on the believer the believer could
[14:39] not be cleansed so that the sacrifice so
[14:41] that that life could come back and all
[14:42] those kind of things but yeah yeah and
[14:45] this day it what it was typing was that
[14:49] that that
[14:53] there's more to this just and just being
[14:55] a good person there's more of this and
[14:57] just trying to affect things in a
[14:59] political realm or whatever we need we
[15:01] need to adhere to the Word of God that
[15:04] is the only way that change can be
[15:06] wrought in our lives you
[15:08] see you won't be changed because you're
[15:10] friends with a popular preacher I think
[15:12] sometimes that's what we try to do we we
[15:14] would you know people want to be your
[15:16] friends which is good I like friends and
[15:18] everything but but being friends with a
[15:20] minister or whatever won't won't change
[15:22] you you got to be friends with Jesus
[15:24] Christ you got to be friends with him
[15:26] you got to get maybe get along get
[15:28] concerned about your state your the
[15:30] place that you're in spiritually right
[15:32] now and get alone with God sometime and
[15:34] find out what he really means to you
[15:36] what he wants to do to you
[15:39] hell is gonna be filled with good people
[15:41] there's a lot of good people you see and
[15:43] it's more there's more at stake here
[15:45] than just living a good life and being a
[15:48] good person and and maybe not listening
[15:50] to the wrong kind of music and and all
[15:52] those kind of thing that that checklist
[15:53] that we check off
[15:56] you know a lot of times it may be even
[15:58] parents they think that that we can
[16:00] change our kids by maybe like getting
[16:02] them married off to somebody that that
[16:04] would be good for them or whatever my
[16:06] many times that's just that ends up like
[16:09] the worst like a horrible little stewpot
[16:12] of disaster just throw a myth in there
[16:14] and stir it all up and you end up with
[16:16] something horrible but but if you can
[16:18] get them changed first I would say that
[16:21] I want my I would want all of my
[16:23] children to find a good Holy Ghost field
[16:25] man or a woman for my son so especially
[16:29] for my daughters I want I want good
[16:31] holy-o's field man to lead and guide
[16:33] them and direct their lives so that so
[16:35] that so that you know the whole family I
[16:38] said in order
[16:39] tried trying to try to effect change any
[16:42] other way than by the Word of God is
[16:44] just disastrous the Word of God is the
[16:47] only thing that will change us many
[16:50] times we think
[16:51] we'll start thinking that maybe we need
[16:54] like there's some good old doctor feel
[16:56] kind of preaching or dr. Dobson somebody
[16:58] that would advise us and and talk get
[17:01] down maybe at a small level with about
[17:02] Family Matters and all that kind of
[17:04] thing but I believe that what we need is
[17:06] instruction by the word now all that
[17:09] fits in the word of course you've got
[17:10] you've got scriptures about a home life
[17:13] and all that kind of stuff but the Word
[17:14] of God is what we need you see that is
[17:17] the difference between the unbeliever
[17:19] the believer and the make believer is
[17:22] the revelation of the Word of God and
[17:25] this our revelation is the only thing
[17:28] that will keep you it's been the same I
[17:30] say in this hour but it's been in every
[17:32] hour and every hour that is the only
[17:35] thing that will keep you as a revelation
[17:37] a personal revelation of Jesus Christ
[17:39] personally to you that's the only thing
[17:43] that will keep you
[17:45] and in John chapter 6 verse 66 to 68
[17:49] jesus said ask the twelve he said this
[17:52] is Jesus and this is really the
[17:53] scripture that brother in John chapter 6
[17:56] that brother Branham was preaching on
[17:57] when he preached his sermon on it and
[17:59] when he got to the point where he Jesus
[18:01] will begin to he was preaching the third
[18:03] pool and began to talk about I accept
[18:04] you eat my flesh and drink my blood and
[18:06] all these kind of things and everybody
[18:08] it when it when the word went forth it
[18:11] began to split up those three groups of
[18:14] people now now I'm reading this because
[18:16] it says Simon Peter we're talking about
[18:19] the believer here Simon Peter answered
[18:20] him Lord to whom shall we go thou hast
[18:24] the words of eternal life now that
[18:26] doesn't mean that Peter understood
[18:28] that doesn't even mean that he had a
[18:31] revelation but he wasn't gonna go
[18:33] because he was convinced that this man
[18:35] had the words of life a believer is
[18:38] going to anger because he's look he
[18:41] knows he believes that the Word of God
[18:43] is true he's not looking for a loophole
[18:45] or some kind of escape hatch or some
[18:47] kind of shortcut or something he's there
[18:49] he's hanging hanging around because he
[18:51] knows that it's right he's convinced
[18:53] within himself that it's true and if you
[18:56] can ever get your blade to a place where
[18:58] you convince that the minister that your
[19:00] pastor is bringing you the Word of God
[19:02] convinced so much that you believe that
[19:04] brother Branham is a prophet for this
[19:06] age you'll get down and get serious with
[19:09] God about it and get to start to digging
[19:11] through the word and find out what it
[19:12] says I believe that's one thing that I I
[19:15] believe a real true believer ought to do
[19:18] is to find out what they believe fine
[19:20] don't just sit around and let somebody
[19:22] else do the believing for you but find
[19:24] out what's what's over here what's over
[19:26] there and find out what he said about
[19:28] Daniels seventy weeks and what he find
[19:29] out what he said about the seals and
[19:31] find out whether it's something that's
[19:33] important or not because that is the
[19:35] only thing that is going to change you
[19:39] it's not going to change you if you it
[19:41] might change you for the worst if you
[19:43] get married to the wrong person or it
[19:44] might change you to the better if you
[19:45] get married to the right person
[19:47] it might change you if you go get a job
[19:50] at a good place it might change it if
[19:52] you get around good helpful people in
[19:53] the world but the only thing that will
[19:55] change you enough to get you out of here
[19:57] is the Word of God the Word of God you
[20:04] see Simon Peter when when when Jesus
[20:08] asked him who do you say that I am in
[20:10] Matthew chapter 16 and he answered thou
[20:12] art the Christ the Son of the Living God
[20:13] he wasn't basing that on what somebody
[20:16] else had told him he had he was
[20:18] convinced within himself because he had
[20:20] received a revelation of the father and
[20:23] that's how you and I have got to be you
[20:26] know the new birth is not something when
[20:28] you can go to your friends and say God
[20:30] do you think I got the new birth dude
[20:32] let's talk do you what's your opinion
[20:35] about what the new birth is what do you
[20:37] think the new birth is if you go around
[20:39] to all your friends and I think well I
[20:41] think the new birth is where you get a
[20:42] feeling now I think the new birth is
[20:44] when you find the right church I think
[20:46] the new birth is when you when you move
[20:48] up to Jeffersonville and you stay around
[20:50] that group of people I think the new
[20:52] birth is when you what maybe stay around
[20:54] this other group of people you can make
[20:56] the new birth all kinds of things but
[20:58] brother Brown said that the new birth is
[20:59] a personal revelation of Jesus Christ
[21:01] personal into you and you don't have to
[21:04] go ask somebody what do you think do you
[21:06] think what do you think about this
[21:07] because you know you Peter didn't have
[21:09] to go ask everybody around the campfires
[21:11] opinion he knew that you are the Christ
[21:14] eagle and as he was talking to Jesus I
[21:15] know that you're the Christ the Son of
[21:17] the Living God I know who you are that's
[21:20] the kind of revelation that will give
[21:22] you that will give keep you anchored in
[21:25] times like this that will keep you
[21:26] anchored and brother Brent talked about
[21:28] how that that when a believer goes
[21:30] beyond the veil that it's like they're
[21:33] they're anchored in there they've got an
[21:35] anchor in there so that when they come
[21:37] out you can't see the anchor but it's
[21:40] still there it's anchored in there
[21:42] behind the veil it's like a ship another
[21:46] example that he gave was a ship on the
[21:48] sea in it it tosses its anchor over the
[21:50] side and down into the deep blue sea the
[21:53] anchor goes until it anchors on a rock
[21:56] or whatever down down at the bottom it's
[21:59] like the ocean is a veil and you can't
[22:01] see that where the anchor is but yet
[22:04] that boat is not going to move and when
[22:07] you go beyond the veil and you're eating
[22:09] from that man of the hidden manna that's
[22:11] only available to the believer that is
[22:14] an anchor to you that cannot you will
[22:16] not be moved because even though you
[22:18] can't see the anchor you're now looking
[22:21] to the unseen you're looking not with
[22:24] your natural eyes anymore but you're
[22:26] looking past that mail pass that Bay
[22:28] like with a boat with the ocean with the
[22:30] anchor pass that veil you know that
[22:33] you're anchored that's the place that
[22:35] the believer has got to come to that our
[22:37] believer will come to that the believer
[22:40] is anchored not oh some hopes or dreams
[22:42] but an anchor of who they know God is
[22:45] the Bible says that they that know that
[22:47] God shall do great exploits why will
[22:50] they do great exploits because they have
[22:52] a revelation of who Jesus Christ is the
[22:55] Bible says this and wonders will follow
[22:57] them that believe why will they follow
[22:59] him because the one that gave them the
[23:02] revelation is now living in the inside
[23:04] of them performing and doing the works
[23:06] it's Jesus Christ made alive in you
[23:08] that's the only thing that will change
[23:11] you is the word revealed
[23:15] Jesus gave an example of a house built
[23:17] upon a rock and a house built upon
[23:19] sinking sand
[23:20] and then that parable he gave both of
[23:24] those houses were buffeted you know many
[23:26] times will think well I'm going through
[23:28] a rough time I'm being buffeted and
[23:29] everything well both houses all the
[23:31] houses are gonna be buffeted just
[23:33] because you're being buffeted in the
[23:35] rains coming and and maybe you're
[23:37] hearing all these tales about
[23:38] coronavirus and maybe you're hearing all
[23:40] these tales about the police doing bad
[23:41] things and all the things that are going
[23:44] around the earth today maybe you're
[23:45] hearing about you're maybe a little job
[23:47] of suffering losses that's not an accept
[23:50] jobs job was buffeted more than all of
[23:53] us but what kept job is the same thing
[23:56] that will keep you job had an anchor and
[23:58] you know there's a promise in God's Word
[24:00] if you go to inspect to all of the
[24:02] believers down through the history not
[24:04] one of them came out without a victory
[24:06] when Joe came out at the end of his
[24:09] journey at the end of his trial he had
[24:11] double what he was what he started with
[24:13] there's a promise with a believer that
[24:16] God is protecting you God will keep you
[24:19] God will provide for you just it's up to
[24:22] you to be anchored
[24:23] you know I was thinking about what
[24:25] brother Dale's been preaching on about
[24:27] Calvinism versus Arminianism you know
[24:29] God has done his part God did his part
[24:32] by dying and paying it and paying the
[24:35] price on the cross let's make the
[24:37] Calvinism side of it but now that our
[24:39] meaning of this sitting is at the mark
[24:41] Arminius side of it is now you got to do
[24:43] your part you gotta come to church and
[24:46] you got to read and you got to do
[24:47] everything you can to get is that so
[24:49] anchored in the word so that you so that
[24:52] God can have a have a open channel to
[24:55] get inside and work through you and use
[24:58] you and use your body and use your and
[25:01] use your feet and all those kind of
[25:02] things
[25:05] and you see you you got to be anchored
[25:08] in this time you know you look around
[25:11] everybody's got an explanation of this
[25:13] and that everything but only the real
[25:15] true believer has the real true correct
[25:18] explanation of what worked what will
[25:21] precipitate the rapture what what is the
[25:24] requirement for the rapture what do we
[25:26] do it here where did we come from where
[25:28] are we going all those answers there's a
[25:31] lot of people in the news tries it with
[25:33] coming up with a lot of answers there's
[25:34] a lot of people on Facebook that have a
[25:36] lot of answers but the only person that
[25:38] has a real understanding of what's
[25:40] taking place and what we're doing here
[25:41] is the believer with a revelation of
[25:43] Jesus Christ get anchored in Jesus
[25:46] Christ and all this information all
[25:48] these many voices that brother haven't
[25:49] talked about listen to the real true
[25:51] voice that comes from that going beyond
[25:54] the inner veil and anchoring yourself in
[25:57] there in the Holy of Holies I
[26:03] see where I am in my nose
[26:07] let's kind of look at some of the things
[26:09] that were identified in the life of
[26:11] Abraham
[26:12] because God had God had promised God God
[26:15] had promised that Abraham that to
[26:17] Abraham that he was father a nation and
[26:20] so Abraham was believing in that promise
[26:22] and as part of that promise he believed
[26:25] in that promise as Romans chapter 4 says
[26:27] he he
[26:30] this says as it is written I've made
[26:32] thee a father of many nations before him
[26:34] whom he believed even God who quickeneth
[26:37] the dead and calleth those things which
[26:39] be not as though they were who a guest
[26:41] hope believed in hope that he might
[26:43] become the father of many nations
[26:45] according to that which was spoken so
[26:47] shall thy seed be so you see Abraham was
[26:51] looking at the things that he could see
[26:52] and just ignoring him in other words he
[26:55] was saying that everything that I can
[26:56] see is alive all the things that I can
[26:59] see is a lie and you know I believe that
[27:02] that's what the real true believer will
[27:04] do is he will disregard everything that
[27:07] he can see that is contrary to God's
[27:09] Word and look completely holy at God's
[27:13] Word and what you see what that means is
[27:16] that you you will become where you do
[27:19] not stagger at the promises of God
[27:21] because it says that he staggered not
[27:22] and so you will not stagger when you see
[27:25] the doctor's report and when you see the
[27:28] news report the stock market it oh you
[27:31] you think about you think about the
[27:33] faith that Abraham had where he
[27:36] disregarded everything that he could see
[27:38] with his natural eye and then you go to
[27:40] the doctor and the doctor gives you a
[27:42] bad report if you're a seed of Abraham
[27:45] disregard the things that you've seen
[27:47] with your natural eye when that doctor
[27:49] lays that foul report in front of you if
[27:52] it's contrary to God's Word it is a lie
[27:55] do you see do you see that that under
[27:58] that idea of it is a lie builds all the
[28:01] way up from your new birth experience
[28:03] the devil will tell you you're not born
[28:05] again it's a lie the devil will tell you
[28:07] this it's a lie the devil will tell you
[28:09] all the way up until you realize that
[28:11] that mystery of iniquity is a lie
[28:13] because there is no iniquity if this
[28:15] bride you've been purged you've been
[28:18] lost and you've been made spotless
[28:20] everything that the devil's been telling
[28:22] you is a lie it's a lie you've been
[28:24] washed and made white as snow you're
[28:27] clean there's nothing you can come as
[28:30] the wife coming to the groom coming to
[28:32] the marriage walking down the aisle
[28:34] spotless with a veil over your face
[28:37] because you are the word coming to the
[28:39] word the word made flesh
[28:42] everything that the devil tells you was
[28:45] a lie
[28:48] every bond that the devil has you in and
[28:51] when the devil comes and says there's
[28:53] nothing good in you you young people
[28:55] that you have no value let me tell you
[28:57] something if you had no value God we're
[28:59] not coming down the cross for you
[29:03] you begin to think that everybody hates
[29:06] you that the ministers hate you and all
[29:08] that kind of stuff listen listen we
[29:10] wouldn't study and pray and labor for
[29:13] this to get in front of you to tell you
[29:15] a message of good cheer if we hated you
[29:17] and your mom and daddy don't hate you
[29:19] listen nobody hate you you have value
[29:22] let me tell you this you have value and
[29:25] everything that the devil can throw at
[29:26] you is a lie because the devil is a liar
[29:29] and there's no truth in him
[29:32] listen that is what a believer is a
[29:35] believer is somebody they can identify
[29:37] alive say that's a lie I don't believe
[29:39] it I don't believe it I don't believe
[29:41] nothing you got to say devil when you
[29:44] can identify the live it the devil has
[29:47] no hole over you anymore he can't bind
[29:49] you how can the devil bind you with all
[29:51] his lies in his fear if you recognize it
[29:54] and said get thee behind me devil I'm
[29:56] not listening to nothing you got to say
[30:02] listen your whole journey the devil's
[30:05] been trying to tell you that this and
[30:07] that if you look back to your original
[30:09] one day brother Branham came to the
[30:11] point where he said my own natural birth
[30:14] is a lie I'm not the child of Charles
[30:17] and Ella Branham but I'm a child of the
[30:19] king he's the king of kings and Lord of
[30:22] lords because I'm one of his I'm wrapped
[30:25] up in him and I was chosen in him before
[30:27] the foundation of the world I know where
[30:29] I came from I know who my Poppa God is
[30:32] why because I'm a believer I believe
[30:35] Jesus Christ I have a personal
[30:37] revelation of who he is that's what a
[30:40] believer is
[30:42] that kind of believing that couple of
[30:45] believing will anchor you whether devil
[30:48] can throw whatever he can in your face
[30:50] and you you can call it a lie because
[30:52] that's what it is
[30:54] you won't be dissuaded by all the news
[30:57] reports and all the things that people
[30:59] are saying you believe Jesus
[31:04] let's look at another you know brother
[31:06] Brian preached a message five definite
[31:08] identification of the church and that is
[31:09] he was preaching that he used the
[31:11] scripture March 16 to identify what a
[31:13] real believer would be and so if you
[31:17] look at that scripture that says Jesus
[31:19] in mark 16 verse 14 Jesus actually
[31:22] upgraded the disciples for their
[31:24] unbelief any-any said he operated them
[31:27] with their unbelief and hardness of
[31:28] heart because they believed not them
[31:31] which had seen him after he was risen
[31:34] my goodness could you imagine being
[31:36] rebuked by Jesus Christ himself and
[31:39] saying you don't believe and he upgraded
[31:40] them and told him you don't believe you
[31:42] don't believe in the witness to
[31:44] testimony
[31:45] and then he said go ye into all the
[31:48] world he's telling them I'm gonna make
[31:50] you believers and when you're when you
[31:52] come become a believer this is what you
[31:54] are what I want you to do I want you to
[31:57] go into all the world and preach the
[31:59] gospel to every creature why go into all
[32:02] the world cuz that's the only remedy for
[32:05] what the the predicament that the earth
[32:07] is in preaching the gospel is the only
[32:09] remedy the only thing that will change
[32:12] this earth is the word preached and
[32:15] receive into the heart of an unbeliever
[32:17] or a make believer somebody that doesn't
[32:20] know
[32:22] the beginning from the end somebody that
[32:25] doesn't know anything about God and that
[32:27] word falls into their heart and it
[32:29] sparks into an eternal life and and they
[32:31] become changed that's what I want to be
[32:34] is changed not just sit here in a
[32:37] make-believe situation or an unbeliever
[32:40] sitting well I'm coming to church and
[32:42] Here I am and just go through a life
[32:44] cycle after cycle but I want something
[32:46] further within me I want something
[32:48] burning so much that I something's
[32:50] driving me to get along with God and my
[32:53] prayer closet and get with him
[32:55] something's drawn me to get along with
[32:57] him and pour through the pages of the
[32:59] Bible if you're not being tonight then
[33:02] would you get home or maybe before you
[33:04] leave the night you can come up to this
[33:05] altar and get right with God cuz it's
[33:08] getting right with God time
[33:10] if you're not identified as a believer
[33:14] it's time to be identified that way it's
[33:17] time to get serious Chuck's and stop
[33:19] playing around I want to be a believer I
[33:21] want to be genuine
[33:23] [Applause]
[33:24] and it says he that believeth and is
[33:27] baptized shall be saved but he that
[33:29] believeth not shall be damned and these
[33:32] signs shall follow them that believe in
[33:34] in my name shall they cast out Devils
[33:39] do you realize what kind of power you've
[33:41] got I think many times we fail to
[33:43] realize the power that we have that you
[33:46] have power to cast the devil out of your
[33:48] home to sanctify your home to cast get
[33:51] rid of all of those pornography
[33:53] magazines and get right on all that
[33:55] rotten music you have power to get rid
[33:57] of all that stuff because it's written
[33:59] here in God's Word power to cast out
[34:02] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[34:04] they shall take up serpents and if they
[34:07] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[34:09] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[34:11] and they shall recover listen church I
[34:13] still believe that God is a healer
[34:15] because these Hebrews 13:8 if you get in
[34:18] your mind that well we're such a word
[34:20] Church that we don't believe in being
[34:22] healing anybody healed anymore we don't
[34:25] believe in God moving anymore get cast
[34:27] that out of your mind because that is a
[34:29] lie from the devil though all of those
[34:31] things are wrapped up in the word
[34:33] they're part of the word and we still
[34:35] believe that God heals he's still the
[34:37] healer he still moves he can heal your
[34:39] body even right now while you're sitting
[34:41] here listening to me speak he's still
[34:43] able because he's still Hebrews 13:8
[34:46] he's never changed the only difference
[34:49] is while he was walking on the shores of
[34:51] Galilee in his flesh now he's walking in
[34:53] your flesh and that's the only thing but
[34:55] otherwise he's still the same he's the
[34:57] same God and he's still a healer still a
[35:01] deliver oh
[35:07] my she like get on this
[35:10] listen
[35:12] when when those three men walked up to
[35:15] Abraham and Abraham got up and walked
[35:18] with the Lord over to see the two men go
[35:21] down into Sodom and Gomorrah and he
[35:23] stood there and talked to the Lord
[35:26] listen to what the Lord told him about
[35:28] the attributes of a believer this is
[35:31] another attribute of a believer I don't
[35:34] know if we're gonna get two unbeliever
[35:36] in a make believer but anyway maybe what
[35:38] let's talk about believers not and he
[35:41] said it and verse 17 and he said and the
[35:44] Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that
[35:46] thing which I do singing that Abraham
[35:49] shall surely become a great and mighty
[35:51] nation and all the nations of the earth
[35:53] shall be blessed in him now in verse 19
[35:56] is another attribute of a believer for I
[35:59] know him that he will command his
[36:01] children and his household after him and
[36:05] they shall keep the way of the Lord to
[36:07] do justice and judgment that the Lord
[36:10] may bring upon Abraham that which he has
[36:12] spoken of him oh
[36:17] my this is a treacherous scripture a
[36:20] little bit because you see a believer is
[36:23] not just gonna go to church and then go
[36:26] to their job and then they have some
[36:27] children coming up and they just don't
[36:29] care anymore a believer is gonna be
[36:31] watching over those children because a
[36:33] believer knows that the only thing
[36:35] that's going to change those children is
[36:37] the thing that changed themselves and
[36:40] that is the Word of God a real true
[36:42] believer is going to sit down with their
[36:44] kids and talk to them about the word and
[36:46] a real true believer is going to be
[36:47] cognizant aware that the things that
[36:50] they do are being watched by those
[36:52] little kids running around listen when
[36:54] you begin to talk about the ministers
[36:56] and things that are going on in church
[36:57] in that the children are listening to
[37:00] you talk about that and then they'll
[37:01] come to church and the minister's behind
[37:03] the pulpit will be ineffectual because
[37:05] they've heard you talking black
[37:07] bad-mouth the things that are going on
[37:09] in church it won't be able to help
[37:10] anymore the children will get their
[37:12] their hearts hearts all hardened up
[37:14] because of the things that you've said
[37:16] behind closed doors not realizing that
[37:18] those little children are listening to
[37:20] you but listen if you bring up those
[37:22] children and and aware of the Lord and
[37:24] edify them and instruct that I'm not
[37:26] talking about just kind of like little
[37:27] baby form doctrine but I believe that in
[37:30] this same age above a real believer can
[37:32] sit down with their children I should be
[37:34] able to talk to you about serpent seeds
[37:36] and tell them all those stories about
[37:38] their brother Brown I'm talking so that
[37:40] when they grow up they have heard those
[37:41] stories about the squirrels being
[37:43] created
[37:45] it's almost beyond fathoming that
[37:48] somebody could come up and not have
[37:49] heard about the squirrels being created
[37:51] you should be ashamed that I'm a middle
[37:54] just a little bit and then I'll
[37:54] apologize or you should be ashamed for
[37:57] not teaching your children those stories
[37:59] those basic stories of Christianity you
[38:01] should be ashamed
[38:02] that's a reproach upon this church do
[38:05] not teach your children those little
[38:06] basic stories about what brother Branham
[38:08] told and the basic things about what Sir
[38:10] Percy Diaz that's a shame and I never
[38:13] approached a little space
[38:15] and now let me back up from that I
[38:17] apologize I'm sorry for meddling I've
[38:19] done did it I committed it
[38:23] [Applause]
[38:29] well you see your children your children
[38:32] are watching the things that you do
[38:34] they're watching the attitude that you
[38:36] have toward the word they're watching
[38:37] whether you are committed enough or
[38:40] whether you've got one foot in and one
[38:41] foot out and they're watching that
[38:43] they're watching to see how your
[38:45] reaction to the word they're watching to
[38:47] see when you go home if you talk about
[38:49] the preaching and say well I don't know
[38:51] if I believe that do you know that you
[38:53] can trickle now that's that's why
[38:55] brother ever said each generation
[38:57] watches worse and worse because it
[38:59] trickles that the momma will be a
[39:01] flapper and the child will be worse than
[39:03] that and the momma might be an
[39:05] unbeliever but what next if you're an
[39:07] unbeliever and make believer don't send
[39:10] that on down to your children but maybe
[39:12] step back and get out of the way so that
[39:14] they can receive the new birth if you
[39:15] don't got it
[39:16] [Music]
[39:19] listen about I think sometimes maybe
[39:21] Minister may be my own self we get to
[39:23] thinking that we're in church to be
[39:25] popular or whatever but popularity has
[39:27] nothing to do with it I believe that
[39:29] preaching of the gospel is to bring
[39:31] truth because truth is what will set you
[39:33] free
[39:34] truth is what will change you it might
[39:36] hurt a little bit in my sting but truth
[39:38] is what we need and that's what you need
[39:40] I don't don't go home and say I'm not
[39:43] going to tell my children truth truth is
[39:46] what they need they need you to pull
[39:48] them over to the side and say listen
[39:49] you're living in sin you're doing wrong
[39:52] I love you but this cannot go on they
[39:56] need you to tell them truth
[39:57] [Music]
[40:00] what they need is for mom and daddy to
[40:03] have a backbone
[40:04] mom and dad have a backbone and tell
[40:06] them like it is and tell them this is
[40:08] what they believe I'm sorry you disagree
[40:11] but but I believe in addressing this
[40:13] particular way I believe in dressing
[40:15] like a Christian because I'm dressing
[40:17] for where I'm going my eternal home into
[40:19] the glory and they don't dress like the
[40:21] world in New Jerusalem and that's where
[40:23] that's where I'm going one day so that's
[40:25] how I'm going to dress and if you don't
[40:26] like it as long as you sit with your
[40:28] feet under my table you've got to abide
[40:30] by my rules listen I believe in setting
[40:34] standards because that's my next point
[40:37] as a believer stands for what they
[40:40] believe in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 13
[40:43] it says wherefore taken either whole
[40:44] armor of God that you may be able to
[40:46] withstand in the evil day and having
[40:48] done all to stand in other words after
[40:51] you been clothed yourself in the armor
[40:54] of the Word of God then you were
[40:56] equipped to stand and you will stand you
[40:59] will stand for something you're not a
[41:01] man that will doesn't stand for
[41:03] something is going to fall for anything
[41:04] and I believe a real believer in this
[41:07] day is gonna stand for something they're
[41:09] not just gonna have a wishy-washy
[41:10] backbone they're not gonna let their
[41:12] their family their the man a real
[41:14] Christian man is not gonna let his wife
[41:16] run all over him and tell him to sit at
[41:18] set him in the back seat and say I'm
[41:19] gonna drive wherever I'm I'm gonna lead
[41:22] my family a real Christian man is gonna
[41:25] be the head of his home
[41:30] and if you want to stand for something
[41:32] you got to know what you're standing for
[41:34] a
[41:35] real Christian man is gonna know what
[41:38] he's standing for a
[41:41] real Christian young man or young lady
[41:44] is gonna know what they're standing for
[41:52] you know I you think about maybe if
[41:54] maybe tonight think about the things
[41:56] that you stand for do you stand for
[41:57] something
[41:58] what are you staying for I stand for a
[42:01] genuine new birth experience I don't
[42:04] stand for just coming to church year
[42:05] after year and just kind of hoping that
[42:07] everything works out all right but I
[42:09] stand for a new birth experience where a
[42:11] change has been wrought in your life I
[42:14] stayed I stand for an old-fashioned
[42:17] altar experience like Abel had like
[42:19] weren't able we're brother have talked
[42:20] about when he brought a sacrifice up to
[42:22] the altar and he and he laid himself
[42:23] upon that sacrifice he laid himself up
[42:26] there because listen I believe I believe
[42:29] sometimes you get to a place where you
[42:31] just you can't you're so sick of
[42:33] yourself you want something to happen
[42:34] and I believe that's what happened with
[42:36] Abel's life I believe I believe when you
[42:38] when you realize that maybe you don't
[42:40] fit in that believer category maybe
[42:43] you're sliding over into that make
[42:44] believer or unbeliever category
[42:45] something on a prick your soul so much
[42:48] that you want something to be changed in
[42:50] you you own something you own something
[42:52] real and that's that old-fashioned alter
[42:55] experience like brother Rama had in his
[42:57] woodshed where he got to pray it and he
[42:58] got to calling out to God God was
[43:00] drawing him sure but he was responding
[43:02] God was doing the draw and that's the
[43:05] Calvinism it but he responded he got on
[43:07] his knees and fulfilled his part that's
[43:09] the Arminianism don't let the
[43:11] Arminianism slide you've got to do your
[43:13] part you got to get in the word and find
[43:15] out whether you're a real believer or
[43:17] not
[43:22] and then the last thing that I'm gonna
[43:25] talk about a believer
[43:27] at that time is moving around a little
[43:31] bit
[43:32] it's already eight o'clock
[43:36] when Abraham looked down and Sodom and
[43:38] Gomorrah
[43:39] something began to prick you when you
[43:43] look at that make believer when a real
[43:44] believer looks said that make believer
[43:46] and unbeliever something goes to stir it
[43:48] when you've got when God's got a hold of
[43:51] you and you you have a real true
[43:53] revelation of what this message is
[43:55] something begins to move it inside of
[43:57] you a feeling for the people listen you
[44:00] know that's the only way that really you
[44:02] can reach people is the love of God is
[44:04] inside of you and the only thing that'll
[44:06] bring that kind of Agape Love not figlio
[44:09] not storge all those other greek
[44:12] expressions of love the agape love the
[44:14] feeling for your brother is is that
[44:17] revelation of who he is and Abraham had
[44:20] a revelation he was talking to that son
[44:22] of man standing there beside him and he
[44:24] looked down at Sodom and Gomorrah and
[44:26] began to call out what about lot what
[44:28] about these are righteous believe is
[44:30] there anybody down there that can be
[44:32] saved you know there's a quote where
[44:33] brother Brennan said that lot was saved
[44:34] because of Abraham because and I believe
[44:38] that in this day the foolish virgin are
[44:41] going to be impacted by the life that
[44:43] the believer lives and it'll keep them
[44:44] sanctified they don't they'll desire to
[44:46] L desire to stay away from the
[44:49] denominational system the desire to stay
[44:51] away from all those things and it'll
[44:53] keep them it'll keep maybe your prayers
[44:55] will keep them maybe maybe your desire
[44:57] to talk to him a little bit will keep
[44:59] them and what what saves people this
[45:01] attribute that I'm talking about is that
[45:03] sigh and and cry and this doubt that a
[45:06] real true believers make man making
[45:08] manifest do you know there's so many
[45:11] scriptures in the Bible that talk about
[45:12] a believer sign and crying a believer
[45:16] something inside of them to longing to
[45:18] see other save if you don't have that
[45:21] longing inside of your heart to see
[45:23] other people save just not not just your
[45:25] kids but the whole church the whole the
[45:28] whole human race something's missing in
[45:30] your life
[45:31] are you falling in that category of a
[45:34] real true believer tonight is there
[45:36] something inside of you this sign and
[45:38] crying to see other people saved
[45:40] let's read what the scripture says in
[45:43] Abraham do near and said will thou also
[45:45] destroy the righteous with the root
[45:46] wicked peradventure there be 50
[45:49] righteous within the city will they also
[45:51] destroy and not spare the place for the
[45:53] fifty righteous that are therein that be
[45:55] far from thee to do after this manner to
[45:58] slay the righteous with the wicked and
[46:00] then the other scripture that we
[46:02] commonly quote as the sequel chapter 9
[46:03] verse 4 and the Lord said unto him go
[46:06] through the midst of the city through
[46:07] the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark
[46:10] upon the foreheads of the men that sigh
[46:12] and cry for all the abominations that be
[46:15] done in the midst thereof but the
[46:17] scripture that I really kind of fallen
[46:19] want to focus on is the scripture that's
[46:21] that's kind of the hallmark of a mixed
[46:23] multitude is about in the Bible and
[46:25] that's when the Israelites came to
[46:27] kadish Barnea that mixed multitude all
[46:30] huddled around and all mixed in
[46:32] Israelites Egyptians have mixed all kind
[46:36] of whatever you could say the same thing
[46:38] as we're talking about here those three
[46:40] categories the real true believer the
[46:43] unbeliever and then make believer and
[46:45] look look at what Joshua and Caleb his
[46:47] reaction to this situation is the make
[46:49] believer and the unbeliever said I don't
[46:51] think that we can go in now think about
[46:54] this now this is one one kind of
[46:57] maybe a topic that I've talked to Zack a
[47:00] lot before how few there were
[47:03] how few there were just to
[47:06] Joshua and Caleb were the only ones that
[47:10] had a revelation that they could take
[47:12] the land
[47:14] they had a revelation they were so
[47:16] anchored that they knew that their God
[47:18] it didn't matter all the Giants it
[47:21] didn't matter all the obstacles because
[47:24] they were seeds of Abraham they're of
[47:26] the seed of Abraham that's being of the
[47:28] seed of Abraham was when you disregard
[47:30] you call everything that you can see
[47:33] that it's contrary to God's Word as a
[47:35] lie God is able to give us power to take
[47:40] over the land and it says in numbers
[47:42] chapter 14 verses 4 to 6
[47:44] and they said one to another letters
[47:46] make a captain and let us return into
[47:48] Egypt then Moses and Aaron fell on their
[47:51] faces before all the Assembly of the
[47:53] congregation of the children of Israel
[47:54] and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the
[47:57] son of Jephunneh which were of them they
[47:59] searched the land rent their clothes
[48:02] could you imagine that dismay that they
[48:05] had to see that they were they were
[48:07] there they were there at the door to the
[48:11] promised and they were raided it cross
[48:13] over it's like it's like when you're
[48:15] going to a good get together with your
[48:16] friends and all your friends are like I
[48:18] don't want to go at the last minute and
[48:20] they were there at the place at the
[48:22] crossing over and everybody else said
[48:24] God is not able to live could you
[48:26] imagine think what was in their minds
[48:28] maybe the same thing that's in many of
[48:30] us many of the true believers Minds
[48:32] today as we think about how God has sent
[48:35] a pillar of fire God has sent signs and
[48:38] wonders God sent a prophet that turned
[48:40] his back to the audience and called out
[48:42] sins and sicknesses behind him and God
[48:44] said the word in this hour to give us
[48:46] rapture and faith to turn our hearts
[48:48] back to the original faith of the
[48:50] Pentecostal fathers he pulled out all
[48:52] the stops and then to come to that
[48:54] crossing-over place and say we're not
[48:57] able to do it
[48:59] that would cause anybody to rent their
[49:02] clothes to rid their clothes and say
[49:04] what's
[49:05] it's God not the same yesterday today
[49:08] and forever is he not the same today
[49:11] that he's always been he still Hebrews
[49:14] 13:8
[49:15] he's still able to fulfill his word he's
[49:19] not a backslider on his promises if he
[49:22] started you on your journey he's able to
[49:24] finish it and that's where we get into
[49:27] the unbeliever and I'm not gonna I know
[49:29] we're kind of closing in on on
[49:31] I'm not gonna take as much time with the
[49:34] unbeliever and the make believer as they
[49:35] did with a believer don't get worried I
[49:40] know it's was denied and I'm not going
[49:42] to keep you forever but but look look at
[49:45] some of these these kind of high points
[49:47] of their unbeliever because that there's
[49:48] a difference between the unbeliever and
[49:50] the and the genuine believer and then
[49:53] make believer and the unbeliever you
[49:55] know he thinks he's a believer but the
[49:57] unbeliever has a problem with and you
[49:59] can go back and search this out through
[50:00] the message what the unbeliever has a
[50:02] problem with is a revelation and so an
[50:05] unbeliever looks at everything through
[50:06] that carnal and the story of Abraham and
[50:09] lot lot o types to make believer by the
[50:12] sodomites and all those carnal down
[50:14] there type the unbeliever now now
[50:17] they're in a city but today brother
[50:20] Branham said the those three categories
[50:21] are all looked together under the same
[50:24] roof and we might not have any sodomites
[50:27] like that here but you can still be
[50:29] carnal in your mind and be looking at
[50:32] the word through through your flesh
[50:34] through your fleshly understanding
[50:36] through the understanding of your brain
[50:37] matter without looking at it through
[50:39] that understood a filter of the
[50:41] revelation of God's Word through that
[50:43] thinking man's filter the thinking man's
[50:46] filter will give you an understanding of
[50:48] what the word is and so a carnal
[50:51] believed a carnal unbeliever will try to
[50:54] figure everything out and they'll
[50:56] they'll they you know they'll come and
[50:58] argue and I just kind of wrote down some
[51:00] things just some things that brother and
[51:02] I said about it they're fine as long as
[51:05] they can get it explained and so that's
[51:08] what they want you to do is they want
[51:09] you to explain it out just line it out
[51:12] so that they can get it through their
[51:13] carnal reasoning and then that'll be
[51:15] good enough for them they want to be
[51:17] convinced in their mind like Cain think
[51:20] about Cain as he came up to that
[51:21] offering he said let's talk it over a
[51:24] little bit now Abel had a revelation
[51:25] that it was by blood but Cain was
[51:28] looking at it through his natural
[51:29] understanding I heard it was a fruit
[51:31] tree so I'm gonna go out and get some
[51:33] guard I'm gonna do some garden I'm gonna
[51:35] bring some fruit and some some some
[51:36] baskets of stuff that I got in the field
[51:38] because I heard it was a fruit God said
[51:40] don't eat it fruit so he's looking at it
[51:43] through his natural understanding that
[51:45] is the unbeliever but see God can take
[51:48] God can take old prickly unbeliever and
[51:50] make him a believer so if you're looking
[51:52] today looking sitting with a critic line
[51:55] and thinking I don't know if that's true
[51:57] whatever your state is God is able to
[51:59] take you from that state and put himself
[52:02] inside of you transform you change you
[52:05] by the opening of the word and make you
[52:07] a real true believer somebody that
[52:09] doesn't dispute with the word and I was
[52:11] looking for Luke just looking for a
[52:12] chance to turn around and go the
[52:14] opposite direction
[52:15] bugger up said an unbeliever it's fine
[52:17] as long as long as they can get patted
[52:19] on the back fine as long as you could
[52:21] think about that an unbeliever does not
[52:25] care about Revelation you could Pat them
[52:27] on the back as long as you pat them on
[52:30] the back o give them a hot dog or give
[52:31] them a nice treat or whatever that'll
[52:33] keep them in church but a real believer
[52:36] is there for the word
[52:40] you know brother Brown typed it a lot of
[52:42] times it's like you're fishing and you
[52:44] put a bait on the hook and people come
[52:46] for the bait which is signs and wonders
[52:49] lovely people who the fellowship food a
[52:53] lot of times all that kind of stuff but
[52:54] the fish is gonna bite on that hook and
[52:57] then it's got its got caught and the
[53:00] hook is sharp it hurts a little bit and
[53:03] the hook is the hook of the word so a
[53:05] lot of times we come we come around the
[53:07] unbeliever might be attracted by the
[53:09] good fellowship and being among good
[53:11] people and everything but let him get a
[53:13] taste of that hook one time but he'll
[53:14] get changed the fisherman will pull him
[53:17] out on the shore and it'll change him
[53:19] into something
[53:23] let's see well brother Brown is another
[53:26] thing that brother I just got just a
[53:27] little snippets of things that he said
[53:29] about what an unbeliever is he said when
[53:30] truth or rebuke came they couldn't take
[53:32] the word think about how true that is
[53:34] listen that that hooks got a point on it
[53:37] and it hurts and everything but a real
[53:39] believer wants to be changed they know
[53:42] that's what we're here for and if you
[53:44] tell me the truth I can be changed if
[53:47] you hold it back then really if you're
[53:49] holding back from a believer they get
[53:51] upset with you because they they start
[53:53] thinking you're you're trying to hurt me
[53:55] you don't want my good tell me the truth
[53:57] pop me over the head with it what I want
[54:00] the truth because the truth will change
[54:01] me but an unbeliever just can't take it
[54:04] it's hurtful you tell an unbeliever well
[54:06] you need to be in church well III come
[54:09] on my own time you telling unbeliever
[54:12] they with a long list of all the things
[54:15] that we could say and they blow up and
[54:17] everything because they they don't want
[54:19] they don't see the value in a revelation
[54:21] all they see the value in is being
[54:23] patted on the back and being being built
[54:25] up within themselves so that people can
[54:26] look at them and and and say they're a
[54:28] great guide on everything but we don't
[54:30] want great guys we want somebody that's
[54:32] a real got a real revelation of the
[54:34] truth and they'll say here's another
[54:36] thing brother Brown say that that's too
[54:38] much he said an unbeliever will say
[54:40] that's too much I don't believe we're
[54:43] sitting in church and you started
[54:44] talking about like Jesus when he said
[54:46] except you sweep my flesh and drink my
[54:48] blood that's too much
[54:50] except you eat my flesh and drink my
[54:52] blood whoa whoa now and he said another
[54:56] thing oh I can't believe stuff like that
[54:58] I've never heard of that in my life
[55:01] ain't that a lot of times when you come
[55:03] to church hear hear things that are very
[55:05] strange hear things about a lot of a lot
[55:09] of things that aren't really preached
[55:10] out in the denominational world three
[55:11] pulls that sounds really strange but
[55:14] don't turn around and just go back the
[55:16] other way but hang on a little bit and
[55:18] find out what it really means don't be
[55:20] like an unbeliever and just turn around
[55:21] and go back and listen I'm preaching
[55:24] this like like like we got somebody that
[55:26] might have somebody about to leave the
[55:27] church and that's what not what I mean
[55:28] but you can be an unbeliever sitting
[55:30] here you do that you can unbeliev it be
[55:32] an unbeliever just sit here and turn the
[55:34] dial off and not go further because
[55:37] that's what brother Branham said and I'm
[55:38] believe unbelief will just stop you
[55:40] right in your tracks if you if the
[55:42] bullet if the preachers preaching the
[55:44] sanctification and you say I don't
[55:45] believe that you you're gonna be stuck
[55:47] at justification if the preachers
[55:50] preaching the baptism of the holy ghost
[55:51] comes by receiving the incorruptible
[55:54] seed of God which is the Word of God and
[55:56] you say I don't think that's right I the
[55:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost is just kind
[56:01] of feeling stuff or something whatever
[56:02] else you you will you won't be able to
[56:05] move forward it will stop you in your
[56:07] tracks and that's true all the way up so
[56:11] maybe you get up you get up and closer
[56:13] and closer to adoption and the minister
[56:15] start talking about what adoption really
[56:17] is and the opening of the seals and you
[56:19] say I don't need that I don't I don't
[56:22] know if I need to understand all that
[56:23] then you won't be able to move forward
[56:27] don't don't yield the unbelief like
[56:30] evening but open yourself up to the Word
[56:33] of God so that God can have preeminence
[56:34] in your life
[56:38] and and I'm gonna kind of skim through
[56:40] some quotes so we can get restrict to
[56:41] the mate and make believer in and close
[56:43] up here but Bertha I'm stressed so
[56:44] highly that the church is entirely built
[56:47] upon spiritual revelation and that's the
[56:50] difference here the unbeliever don't
[56:52] want spiritual revelation
[56:54] the believer won't sit
[56:58] at least the believer is honest about
[57:00] what he believes I believe the
[57:02] unbeliever the unbeliever will say well
[57:04] I don't believe that the unbeliever will
[57:06] say well that's too much but a mate
[57:08] believer will sit there and just hang on
[57:11] and act like he's a real true believer
[57:14] and brother around was stressing now
[57:15] that's the most dangerous one of all
[57:18] now not dangerous for you and I not
[57:21] dangerous for you know a believer it's
[57:23] not dangerous it's dangerous for a make
[57:26] believer to sit in that situation and
[57:29] that's why I believe that he preached
[57:31] this sermon so that he could he could
[57:33] identify
[57:34] so that the make believer could be
[57:36] identified in that category and then do
[57:39] something about it
[57:41] now y'all hang on with me just so just a
[57:44] little bit are we doing all right don't
[57:45] don't get don't get tired on me I know
[57:48] sometimes you back get so hurt and
[57:49] everything
[57:50] hang on but if your back hurts too bad
[57:53] then you can go back and listen to it on
[57:55] the recording I guess
[57:58] brother ever said Abraham and the
[58:00] message to Abraham he said now I see
[58:02] Abraham sitting in the tent door one
[58:03] morning he said there was a big oak tree
[58:05] in front of this place there this is a
[58:07] 1961 the message Abraham he said they
[58:10] claim the oak still stands they got it
[58:13] preserved they say well there were we
[58:15] had his tent pitched out there on the
[58:16] desert lot was down there my guess if
[58:18] they had had such a thing he'd had a big
[58:20] sit listen I would describes a lot I
[58:22] guess if they had had such a thing he'd
[58:24] had a big cigar and mayor of the city
[58:29] you know and misses a lot and her
[58:32] daughters and all of them going around
[58:34] to all the fashioned soap shows watching
[58:36] the TV and patterned after the styles of
[58:40] those days but Sara stood truth truth
[58:43] Abraham stood truth they stayed with God
[58:46] stayed out there now those things that I
[58:50] just read in that quote they might not
[58:51] really heat anybody nobody's here mayor
[58:53] or nobody nobody smoked cigars and all
[58:56] those kind of things but the point still
[58:57] stands that a make believer likes to
[59:00] have their foot out in the world a
[59:01] little bit or out in some strange
[59:03] doctrine a little bit or just kind of
[59:05] dabbling in this stuff that it's not
[59:07] sticking right straight right down the
[59:09] line with a true Word of God
[59:12] they like they like they liked all the
[59:15] comforts of the world and you know the
[59:17] Bible says that if you love the world or
[59:18] the things of the world that love of God
[59:20] is not even eating you a make-believe or
[59:22] maybe maple or just we just play a
[59:24] little bit of country music on the side
[59:26] because I you know it doesn't bother me
[59:27] when there's talking about us singing
[59:29] all them songs about adultery and all
[59:31] that kind of stuff you see I make
[59:32] believe I might not have a problem with
[59:34] out with with drugs or movie stars or
[59:36] looking at all this fashion lascivious
[59:39] clothing or just a little bit of
[59:41] fornication or what if I've got a little
[59:42] fornication going on in my home I don't
[59:44] have a problem with that or a little bit
[59:46] of swear words that we say every now and
[59:48] then because I got my foot halfway in
[59:50] and halfway out and listen you can
[59:52] almost go down the road of making it
[59:54] looking like a legalistic form but I'm
[59:56] talking about doctrine to a real true
[59:59] believers gonna stay right with a word
[1:00:00] but a make believers halfway in and a
[1:00:03] half way out and dabbling with stuff
[1:00:05] that he shouldn't ought to be but listen
[1:00:08] because what a make believer is is he's
[1:00:09] not quite sure what the real evidence of
[1:00:13] the new birth is he's not quite sure how
[1:00:16] he should be acting he's not quite sure
[1:00:19] how everything operates I'm not quite
[1:00:22] sure how the healing operates but we're
[1:00:25] going to kind of go through the motions
[1:00:26] of preying on somebody not quite sure
[1:00:28] how the new birth works or everything
[1:00:30] but I'm going to try to try my best to
[1:00:32] kind of act and put on a good show
[1:00:34] because brother I'm said of make
[1:00:35] believer is the one that puts those like
[1:00:37] a crow sticking those peacock feathers
[1:00:39] in him he's not quite sure how he should
[1:00:41] become a peacock but he's going to do
[1:00:44] his very best to act like a peacock and
[1:00:46] that's what I make believer is now see
[1:00:48] an unbeliever will just kind of turn
[1:00:50] around and go the the way sigh that's
[1:00:51] too much I can't believe it but a make
[1:00:54] believer will hang around and say yeah a
[1:00:56] P being a peacock is a good thing being
[1:00:59] a real believer is a good thing I want
[1:01:02] to stick this peacock feather in me so
[1:01:04] that everybody else will think that I'm
[1:01:06] something that I'm not see I make
[1:01:08] believer as a hypocrite I make believer
[1:01:10] doesn't realize yeah
[1:01:15] I make believer doesn't know what the
[1:01:19] word says but he thinks he does you see
[1:01:22] how it all comes back to Revelation and
[1:01:24] I'm believer dunwall revelation and a
[1:01:26] make believers trying to fake it and we
[1:01:30] were talking on the way over here my
[1:01:31] wife was sharing a quote that she read
[1:01:33] were brother I was talking about the
[1:01:34] Pharisees how they could they were they
[1:01:36] saw Jesus even all the disciples before
[1:01:38] the new birth they they touched him and
[1:01:40] they held him and they could talk to him
[1:01:42] and so they knew Jesus in the flesh
[1:01:47] excuse me but they didn't they
[1:01:50] knew Jesus in the flesh was how many
[1:01:53] people do today they know by coming to
[1:01:56] church and it's being around they know
[1:01:58] from an intellectual understanding
[1:01:59] everything but what's lacking is a
[1:02:02] revelation a personal revelation of who
[1:02:04] that person is it's not enough just to
[1:02:07] be able to read the Bible and what we
[1:02:09] were talking about eyes out how
[1:02:10] denomination Baptists and what not it's
[1:02:12] a lot of times by because they know
[1:02:14] Jesus by the flesh they can argue
[1:02:16] Scripture and back and forth and talk
[1:02:18] about go around and around in circles
[1:02:19] and everything but they're still lacking
[1:02:22] a revelation of who he is they're still
[1:02:25] lacking the ability to read between the
[1:02:27] lines
[1:02:30] see I make believer brother am said will
[1:02:33] always be sitting around hanging around
[1:02:34] looking for a fault why they why are
[1:02:36] they looking for false all the times
[1:02:38] because they know within themselves that
[1:02:40] they're faker and so they think
[1:02:42] everything else is fake there they're
[1:02:44] like we talked before many times in
[1:02:45] private about projecting for somebody
[1:02:48] that's guilty of something they'll
[1:02:49] project that on somebody else a lot of
[1:02:51] times to say you're you're an adulterer
[1:02:53] or whatever when they themselves are
[1:02:55] guilty and see that's what the
[1:02:57] make-believe
[1:02:58] they themselves are not a genuine
[1:03:00] article so they start pointing fingers
[1:03:02] and everything else saying well I wonder
[1:03:04] if that's truly true I wonder maybe
[1:03:06] maybe say about the ministers I wonder I
[1:03:08] wonder if those ministers really do have
[1:03:10] the new birth how would you know how
[1:03:12] would you know if they really got the
[1:03:14] new birth how do you even know that
[1:03:15] brother Branham was right how do you
[1:03:17] know that brother rounds are real
[1:03:18] prophet all those kind of thing looking
[1:03:20] for a fault faking it and what they're
[1:03:22] doing is they're presuming and brother
[1:03:25] Brown said to presume as to venture
[1:03:27] without authority and authority comes by
[1:03:29] the revelation of the word so if you go
[1:03:31] out without and without a revelation
[1:03:33] you're just presuming and a make
[1:03:36] believer just presumes now some examples
[1:03:39] just to look at it real quick in the
[1:03:40] Bible or you know when it went when
[1:03:43] Ghazi when Elisha and Gaza got
[1:03:45] surrounded by all the Syrians Ghazi got
[1:03:47] all wrapped up and began to look at
[1:03:49] circumstances and everything and he
[1:03:51] began to you know began to look at
[1:03:54] things look at circumstances and whatnot
[1:03:57] now now we don't we don't want to keep
[1:03:59] our eye on circumstances we want to but
[1:04:02] but see when the lie just said he prayed
[1:04:04] and his eyes were open and all of a
[1:04:07] sudden he became anchored in the word
[1:04:09] now what would anchored him in the word
[1:04:11] all those angels that he saw all of a
[1:04:13] sudden they didn't do nothing they
[1:04:15] didn't yank their swords out they didn't
[1:04:17] go to fighting or whatever but Gahan Z
[1:04:19] realized that those angels were there
[1:04:22] and that presence of the angels realized
[1:04:25] to anchor to him in the faith and all of
[1:04:27] a sudden he knew that now we are able
[1:04:30] the God God's on our side
[1:04:32] the Syrians aren't able to do anything
[1:04:34] against this because now Ghazis anchored
[1:04:37] in the word you can see that's what
[1:04:41] that's the difference between presuming
[1:04:43] and actually being anchored before he's
[1:04:46] all afraid and wondering look at look at
[1:04:48] the signs of the times
[1:04:49] you might look at all the things that
[1:04:51] are happening in the earth and not be
[1:04:53] anchored but now is the time to pray
[1:04:56] that God will open your eyes to the
[1:04:58] revealed truth and when your eyes are
[1:05:00] opened like the Hajis eyes were open it
[1:05:03] will anchor you in the word now here's
[1:05:06] another example Peter Peter began to
[1:05:08] presume you know you know yes Jesus can
[1:05:11] I step out on the water onto the water
[1:05:14] and he he began to he began to walk out
[1:05:18] he had on that substance faith and then
[1:05:20] began to look at circumstances and he
[1:05:22] began to sink but now see that's our
[1:05:25] problem we look at circumstances and
[1:05:27] things news articles and things going on
[1:05:30] in the world instead of looking at the
[1:05:31] world of God but when his eyes got back
[1:05:33] on Jesus then he was able to walk back
[1:05:36] into the boat on that substance faith
[1:05:38] and see this is what Paul was worried
[1:05:41] about he said in Colossians chapter 2
[1:05:43] verse 4 he said and this I say lest any
[1:05:45] man should beguile you with enticing
[1:05:47] words
[1:05:48] in Colossians chapter 2 he said let no
[1:05:51] man beguile you of your reward and the
[1:05:53] voluntary humility and worshipping of
[1:05:55] angels but God you means to get you off
[1:05:58] of the of the right thing to make you to
[1:06:01] get you to look at something else other
[1:06:03] than the word if you can just stay
[1:06:05] focused right on the word that is the
[1:06:08] thing that will keep you and will change
[1:06:10] you and will keep you to the finish line
[1:06:14] see another thing the brother under said
[1:06:17] about these make believers he said
[1:06:18] they'll say oh I believe this and I
[1:06:20] believe this and I believe this but oh
[1:06:22] you know I heard somebody say it's so in
[1:06:25] so x to see that's beguiling words I
[1:06:28] heard somebody say I heard somebody see
[1:06:32] you there's so many voices interpreting
[1:06:34] the events and things but modern events
[1:06:37] are made clear by prophecy if you if you
[1:06:40] can look into the message you'll you
[1:06:42] won't be led astray by all the a brother
[1:06:44] I said Oh see just long with ears see it
[1:06:48] make believers got them long years
[1:06:50] trying to find out the secret to the
[1:06:54] whole thing what's the secret to a new
[1:06:56] birth what's the secret what's the
[1:06:58] secret to a body change trying to figure
[1:07:01] it out so that they can think it
[1:07:04] and he said and that's exactly what the
[1:07:06] Judas finds right now he'll come right
[1:07:08] along with the meeting and watch ride
[1:07:10] around until he can find that little
[1:07:11] spot that he oh there it is that's it
[1:07:14] see oh
[1:07:15] that's the way it's done
[1:07:17] that's the way it's done so he can
[1:07:20] impersonate it and that's why I believe
[1:07:22] that the angel random when you're
[1:07:23] preaching the third pool keep your mouth
[1:07:25] shut because if you tell it all then the
[1:07:29] enemy will be able to do great damage
[1:07:30] you don't tell everything
[1:07:34] because the devil will be able to
[1:07:36] impersonate it and fool people and and
[1:07:39] and do who those were
[1:07:45] let's see a real true believer
[1:07:48] will keep their eye on the word in
[1:07:52] Matthew chapter 24 it says behold I've
[1:07:55] told you before wherefore if they shall
[1:07:56] say to you behold is in the desert go
[1:07:58] not forth behold his and the secret
[1:08:01] chambers believe it not for see all
[1:08:04] these different interpretations of the
[1:08:06] word I'll tell you what you really need
[1:08:07] to be doing is good be going over here
[1:08:09] I'll tell you what you really need to be
[1:08:10] doing is coming to this church over here
[1:08:12] all these all these kind of things for
[1:08:13] as the Lightning cometh out of the east
[1:08:15] and shining even under the west so also
[1:08:17] shall the coming of the Son of Man be
[1:08:18] for wheresoever the carcase is there
[1:08:21] will the eagle's be gathered together
[1:08:22] and what that means is the real true
[1:08:25] believer is not going to be paying much
[1:08:27] attention to all these carnal
[1:08:28] impersonations and all these kind of
[1:08:29] voices all these different news
[1:08:31] interpretations I tell you what this
[1:08:33] what this coronavirus is is this and
[1:08:35] that I'll tell you what this is what all
[1:08:37] these things mean I tell you when what
[1:08:39] we need when when Donald Trump was
[1:08:41] elected that's the last Trump well
[1:08:42] that's a bunch of hogwash
[1:08:44] that's not identifying that's not
[1:08:46] identifying that the secret to a body
[1:08:48] change the secret to a body change lies
[1:08:51] in the word not who's the president or
[1:08:53] who's who's in politics and all that
[1:08:55] kind of stuff
[1:08:57] now one day there is going to be a final
[1:09:00] president but that's not the thing that
[1:09:02] I'm looking at as the indicator I'm not
[1:09:05] looking at what when they start building
[1:09:06] the temple when they finally figure out
[1:09:08] the place on the Temple Mount where they
[1:09:09] can start building that's not going to
[1:09:11] give me a body change even if even if
[1:09:14] the earthquake happens there's another
[1:09:15] earthquake in Los Angeles is gonna
[1:09:17] happen and there's gonna be plenty of
[1:09:18] people left that's not gonna be the
[1:09:20] secret to their body changed but the
[1:09:22] secret to your body change the secret
[1:09:24] lies in the word
[1:09:26] it's a secret that only the bride will
[1:09:29] know the bride knows what she's here for
[1:09:31] and what she's doing and the word the
[1:09:34] word the truth is the separator it
[1:09:37] separates the unbeliever and I'm winding
[1:09:39] down now the separate though the truth
[1:09:41] is what separates the unbeliever to make
[1:09:44] believer and
[1:09:46] the real believe the truth now I think
[1:09:50] many times over the years people have
[1:09:52] tried to set do the separating by
[1:09:54] beating one and over over the head and
[1:09:56] and being mean to one another but that
[1:09:58] that's not how it works it's the truth
[1:10:01] that separates
[1:10:04] the all can go the musicians can go
[1:10:06] ahead and come on up I'm gonna be
[1:10:07] winding down but but you see even in
[1:10:10] this day as in that day I believe that
[1:10:12] believe the true believer is still
[1:10:14] crying out to cease lost souls saved I
[1:10:18] believe I'm trusting that the door is
[1:10:21] not yet closed yet that the last one has
[1:10:23] not yet come in and there's still time
[1:10:26] to change if you're if you find yourself
[1:10:29] falling in that category of an
[1:10:31] unbeliever or a make believer then
[1:10:33] quickly get out of that category find
[1:10:35] find it into your heart to get down on
[1:10:37] your knees and get in God's Word and get
[1:10:40] serious about God that's where I want
[1:10:42] myself tonight to get so serious with
[1:10:44] God that that I just get more and more
[1:10:48] closer to him every day I don't ever
[1:10:50] want to get stagnated and stale and get
[1:10:53] like old cesspool or something I always
[1:10:55] want to be drawing more and more in love
[1:10:57] with Jesus Christ
[1:11:03] don't ever forget don't ever forget that
[1:11:06] first love don't ever forget how to get
[1:11:08] close with God get just shut that that
[1:11:10] prayer closet and get alone with God and
[1:11:12] get get along with him and just talk
[1:11:14] things over with him I think that's what
[1:11:15] so many times we we've forgotten those
[1:11:18] little basic things a real true believer
[1:11:21] will know their God because they have a
[1:11:23] revelation of who he is and they'll want
[1:11:25] that fellowship in that communion with
[1:11:27] him they won't de stick close with you
[1:11:29] amen let's stand to our feet just just
[1:11:31] saying something
[1:11:34] since
[1:11:35] forwards
[1:11:36] [Music]
[1:12:23] I'm not real prone to having spiritual
[1:12:26] dreams but I've only had a couple in my
[1:12:28] whole life that I can recall and
[1:12:31] y'all remember brothers act black
[1:12:34] had a dream he shared with us real
[1:12:36] simple dream but very scriptural and it
[1:12:39] was about three months ago I think and
[1:12:41] he his dream was simply that he went to
[1:12:42] a table and he was eating and he looked
[1:12:45] down he was never full he kept eating
[1:12:47] and eating and eating which goes along
[1:12:49] with my dream that means eating the word
[1:12:51] he's the babe right I mean he's just
[1:12:53] been born again so he's eating well we
[1:12:55] have been born again for a while our
[1:12:56] supposed to be doing the same thing
[1:12:58] we're never supposed to stop that we
[1:13:01] don't look down on Zack said well you
[1:13:02] need to eat no we all need to eat right
[1:13:04] after he had that dream I had a dream
[1:13:06] and this can all just be seated for just
[1:13:09] a minute just take about five minutes
[1:13:11] I'm sorry to take your time but I had
[1:13:14] this dream that I was I was here at the
[1:13:17] church and
[1:13:20] out in the parking lot there was a pool
[1:13:22] in the ground something like a pond
[1:13:24] roughly in volume about the size of
[1:13:27] maybe three of Terrance and lisas
[1:13:29] swimming pools about the size of the
[1:13:31] sanctuary I guess and you know in the
[1:13:33] Bible water represents a lot of things
[1:13:35] but if it's a body it represents people
[1:13:38] so let's assume this represents this
[1:13:40] congregation because it was that church
[1:13:42] and it was this is where I go to church
[1:13:44] so I was out there and in my mind I
[1:13:49] thought I was making corn bread it was
[1:13:51] just kind of weird but that was already
[1:13:53] those three ingredients that was the
[1:13:56] water that was already in that pond and
[1:13:58] I was adding to it handfuls of cornmeal
[1:14:02] I had like a bucket under my arm and I
[1:14:05] was putting in these handfuls of
[1:14:07] cornmeal as I walked around and around
[1:14:10] this pond okay and then the third
[1:14:13] ingredient was oil like vegetable
[1:14:16] so water cornmeal and all there was not
[1:14:20] enough all in my mind I thought I needed
[1:14:23] for some reason four measures of all for
[1:14:25] this recipe I had to go back in church
[1:14:28] to get more all I don't know if this is
[1:14:31] an if game but I'll tell her because she
[1:14:33] was in the dream sister June was helping
[1:14:35] me get more all I don't know why while
[1:14:37] she was in the dream but
[1:14:38] anyway I was in the basement of the
[1:14:41] church getting more oil and then came
[1:14:44] back out and there was still not enough
[1:14:45] all to have four measures and
[1:14:49] there's not a shortage of word there's
[1:14:53] not a shortage of Revelation but there
[1:14:55] is a shortage of seekers people seeking
[1:14:57] and making themselves available which by
[1:15:00] the way just saying God I'm available
[1:15:02] that's not making yourself available as
[1:15:05] studying and praying and seeking God
[1:15:06] that's making yourself available
[1:15:08] anyway there was not going to be enough
[1:15:10] all but I added all that I had I kept
[1:15:12] and I was walking around and around this
[1:15:14] pawn adding these ingredients okay there
[1:15:18] are three
[1:15:19] significant characters to that pond in
[1:15:22] other words three characters that were
[1:15:23] somehow interacting in different ways
[1:15:25] with that pond your believer make
[1:15:27] believe an unbeliever the most important
[1:15:30] one was on the far end and she was
[1:15:33] facing that way which is odd to me
[1:15:36] because that would be West I think but
[1:15:39] she was submerged under the water the
[1:15:42] whole dream she never surfaced she never
[1:15:44] came out which I was spooked out I
[1:15:45] thought maybe she's drowning but she was
[1:15:48] not panicked she was just sitting
[1:15:49] underwater looking up at me every time I
[1:15:51] made a pass adding these ingredients of
[1:15:53] cornmeal and all she was just looking up
[1:15:56] at me she was very receptive very
[1:15:58] attentive and she was not paying
[1:16:01] attention to what the other two were
[1:16:02] doing to me she represents the bride the
[1:16:04] believer because she was sitting there
[1:16:06] just receiving these ingredients staying
[1:16:08] underwater staying settled established
[1:16:10] firm never moving and always stay in
[1:16:13] there in that water and
[1:16:16] receiving those ingredients but now and
[1:16:19] and to describe her the best I could say
[1:16:22] is she was young 20 to 30 years old but
[1:16:24] I can't tell because I couldn't see her
[1:16:25] she was underwater looking up at me the
[1:16:28] other two there was one on a a a lady
[1:16:32] girl on a platform above the pool always
[1:16:35] at the pool but never getting in the
[1:16:38] water she would sit there and talk about
[1:16:41] it she would sit there and talk about
[1:16:42] how good it looked and how much she
[1:16:43] wanted to go the water but she would
[1:16:45] never just get in the water she wasn't
[1:16:47] afraid she just wouldn't get in the
[1:16:49] water she sat there always at the pool
[1:16:52] but never getting in just talking about
[1:16:54] it all the time and I'm afraid that's
[1:16:56] where a lot of people are sitting like
[1:16:57] brother Bob was talking about because
[1:16:59] they just won't go on and receive a new
[1:17:01] birth the other one was like a boy ten
[1:17:04] years old Latino looked like a dark
[1:17:06] complexion dark hair and he was just
[1:17:09] jumping in and out of the pool in and
[1:17:11] out in and out up and down he was always
[1:17:13] in and out sometimes he was there
[1:17:14] sometimes it's not getting in and out of
[1:17:16] the pool and just like he was playing in
[1:17:18] a pond you know oh I laughed at the
[1:17:21] dream I got up and I said Gabby I had a
[1:17:22] dream I made cornbread for the whole
[1:17:23] church and I just went on and thought it
[1:17:25] was just a silly dream and the more I
[1:17:27] meditated on that dream for the last
[1:17:28] three months the more thought about how
[1:17:30] spiritual I was and I thought maybe it's
[1:17:32] just for me I asked the Lord do I need
[1:17:34] to share this with the church and I
[1:17:35] waited and I waited and I waited and
[1:17:37] then earlier this week I woke up to the
[1:17:40] sound of brother Dale's voice saying
[1:17:41] tell the dream and I don't know I
[1:17:44] thought maybe I should just go ahead and
[1:17:45] tell it and I'm still kind of waiting
[1:17:46] and then brother Bob came to night and
[1:17:48] preached believer make believe an
[1:17:50] unbeliever so I thought I should tell it
[1:17:52] but ever since that time I've had in my
[1:17:54] mind a vision of this girl I'm not
[1:17:56] worried about the believer and the mate
[1:17:58] believer and unbeliever just that one
[1:18:00] girl that represents the bride they're
[1:18:01] sitting there receptive always attentive
[1:18:03] always listening and receiving the word
[1:18:05] and it's been just an image in my mind
[1:18:07] it'll order let me beat that one like my
[1:18:10] wife sits up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the
[1:18:12] morning listening to sermons of these
[1:18:13] men she's not listening to other
[1:18:15] ministers in the message she
[1:18:16] specifically listening to our five
[1:18:17] ministers because these are men sent to
[1:18:19] us there were deign to see us through
[1:18:21] that's why I'm so built up on this
[1:18:23] fivefold ministry that God's given us
[1:18:25] and listening over and over and over if
[1:18:28] I fall asleep whether I fall asleep or
[1:18:30] not I go back missing over and over and
[1:18:32] over to these sermons gleaning every
[1:18:34] little nugget that I'm getting because I
[1:18:36] want those ingredients which is the word
[1:18:38] and spirit that's what I want the word
[1:18:40] in the spirit god bless
[1:18:46] hey we shake that the Bible says young
[1:18:50] men will seep dream dreams old men or

[1:22:06] you know another attribute of a believer
