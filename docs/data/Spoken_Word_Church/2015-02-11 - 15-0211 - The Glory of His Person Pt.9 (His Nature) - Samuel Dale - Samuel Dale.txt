brother and sisters back there and uh seem like they've been here before that faith looks familiar but if they don't we say welcome because that's uh we always say to you the first time you come he said welcome second time you come you're part of us so then we don't have anything to join up with and i'll be glad to have you with us tonight and good to see you sister johnny called me she got the message from terrance on the internet said for me to make sure and explain things you know she she had a previous appointment this morning that she didn't realize about it and she had to go with a nephew and things but you know she was supposed to call back and didn't get in touch with us but she said that they ran the test parts of what they were doing and you know getting ready they still got other things that's got to be done all right so they don't know yet what to do so she said she would explain all of it and then you know how doctors are they want you to go to this one i want you to go to that one once you go that one you know i remember one time was reading about you know they were say the reason they write in latin that the druggists you know and the doctor they got a good deal going and they write it in latin and what it says on there i got my money you get yours it doesn't say on there what kind of medicine to do it just says that part but that's pretty well the way they do but i'm sure she'll explain it to us maybe sunday you know in all of the things so remember that remember wade will be taking up the lord willing again on sunday to continue his series on the statue of a perfect man and let's see uh something else oh yeah we've got the the valentine bandwidth coming up this saturday make sure and be there on time for the couples and things that have signed up and and all and we're looking forward to a good time we always do we'd have a good fellowship together in the lord any other announcements that we are missing we generally i mentioned sister gabriel a while ago yeah remember sister gabriel she's been having problems this week with what was it diarrhea yeah yeah all right so remember that just keep her keeper in your prayers and i guess taran said remember my sister they've given her maybe 24-48 hours to live so remember that and you know just keep the family in your prayers all right if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to revelations 1 and genesis 1. we're going to try to pick up the thought from sunday and continue on a little bit and what we're talking about so let's just pray heavenly father we thank you for an opportunity to be able to come together tonight lord in your grace and your love and to be able to just fellowship a little bit around you and talk about you and the bible says that the children they speak often one to another and the book of remembrance was written so we believe lord that in this last days that a book of remembrance is being written about the little bride because she's becoming your word and we thank you we just ask you to have your way with each and every one of us forgive our sins remember the sickness among us lord talking to brother gary there today about his foot we pray that you would just reach down and touch that and make all things well because we believe you and father we we commit everything into your hands now just have your way in the service you said you sent your word and healed us and so lord as the word goes forth may we receive it just have your way with us in jesus name amen all right revelations 1 beginning with verse 10 and i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice says of a trumpet saying i'm alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou see us write in the book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus and unto smyrna and unto pergamos and under tartara and a disartist and into philadelphia and who and unto lady osea where we are right and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothe with a garment down to the foot and gird about to pouch with a golden girdle amen so remember that let's go to genesis 1 and we'll read 26-27 god said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the iron over the cattle and over all the earth and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and you may be seated the lord had his best blessing to the reading of the word now i ran off the notes that i was using sunday not all of them just some of the basic quotes that i wanted to you to keep and remember and you know so i hope you will keep these and you can refer back to them you know later on sometime in your life and you need them or something because we we appreciate it because we thank god he sent us a prophet and gave us his word to be able to overcome if any age ever needed anything about overcoming it certainly this age because everything has gone wrong can go wrong and nobody can seem to do anything right they figure it out this way and about the time they get it figured out it falls through so that's the way i guess it's supposed to be but now we've been talking about how that and go ahead and pull up the drawing brother joe and we'll we'll start a little bit from there we've been talking about one true and living god we read here in genesis it says let us make man in our own image all right we trinitarians you know we used to we loved that because it sounded like there was two or three people but we know in reality that that's not true but then we you know we we try to figure out everything and we we believe and i just made a little simple uh sketch of a drawing because we've been talking about the attributes of god all right the attributes of god what makes up his as we'll get to it in a minute and you see that i put it all the way down and uh it brings it to the bring it down to the point now we've left another one tonight to where that he can go if he'll roll it on up and you'll see that all of this that we were talking about equals out to be the very nature of god now we'll get to that later in the message on understanding all right but it all equals out to be that now attributes you are the attributes of your or the attribute of your father you know that's a simple point and uh we believe then the attributes of god that he had those attributes before the world he didn't gain attributes coming into the world he gained the ability to display those attributes all right there's only three attributes of god which is father son and holy ghost that's the three attributes so then all you're looking at is involved in one of those three attributes of father son and holy ghost and seeing it then we can look at it and see how that it equals the word coming down and we've been back before the foundation of the world dealing with on this side of what we've labeled as eternity and tonight we're going to try to move over a little bit but i want to make sure that we understand you know and follow the line even if we have to keep continuing the message because it doesn't bother me to try to minister unto you these things uh i really abby i was viewing the uh the sunday afternoon services there the other day and abby she came in there and was sitting there with me and you remember i got a little feist reading and you know i was really going as fast as i could to try to get all the quotes in without it being so much time and still took two hours i guess on that service or something to the order but you know i was really just rolling the cross and abby and me she said probably you sure was reading mighty fast you know so that so you know i was just trying to get it in but i was just going so fast but i've got the quotes here i want to give back to you but now god before the foundation of the world according to christ the mystery of god revealed he had a plan and a purpose in doing these things and that was to let himself to be revealed or made known you know and those attributes that he had as savior healer um christ logos theophany those great big words that we use and probably don't understand not even how to spell most of it let alone what they are but you know we do read and study on what he says the prophet of using those things because i believe he understood don't you you know with a seventh grade education he knew what those words he would have to look them up sometime but yet he understood all right but then seeing that there's just one true and living god there can't be a trinity because there's no such thing in the scriptures and if there is three gods who created who who was the first you know i mean who started what a father within the did the father create the son that the son created the logos you know the theophany the holy ghost or whatever or what are we doing the first commandment says that the lord is one amen all right and see then we got caught up in all of that by mankind teaching us his philosophy that had no background in the bible and for thousands of years mankind has been in the darkness they called it the dark ages of christianity down about a thousand well somewhere a little less up to 1500 they call that the dark ages i differ with that i know it is in the basis of what was going on back there but i believe this is the darkest age i believe now is the darkest age of all things because even though in all the light that there is you know this light cannot put out that total darkness you say yes it has let's put it no it can't put it out darkness is still is here in a ma in a major way around the world today especially in what we call the religious realm of mankind all right and see man still believing those things but we believe in the one true and living god not the god in three persons point because a person's a personality personality is an individual individual is a person so you're saying the same thing as the people who believe in three literal gods and so you don't know it so it's time to wake up and begin to follow the the word and get into the word of understanding all right and in doing that then we we don't want to believe the the trinity concept of god in three persons or any way like that but we don't want to go with the oneness concept because that goes off the scale just as well on the opposite end because the oneness doctrine is what you would call jesus only which would be you know that jesus was the last form of god and you know then that would would why they take care to that like one like your finger you know or the way they would describe it but remember the bride is the life's form of god in the gentile dispensation so then that would leave the oneness out of it but it wouldn't make sure that we didn't go into the trinity all right because see we can't go that away and believe it and now the point we want to get to in a little bit is to make sure that it as we read there in genesis that it says let us make man well that's not two people that's right we went through that we've brought it through and trying to show the things from the prophet that you know uh that how everything went and it's not to go that away it's to go with the real true understanding of one god and to see that he says let us make man that that's word in spirit and that's we can say that that's father and son if we understand because remember how we brought it out trying to illustrate it that you can take the quotes and just quote yourself to death which you can quote all god was he poured into christ and then all christ poured into the church and with our terminology of the human mind of all see then you're leaving a gap over here a vacuum a place that's empty and then you're leaving this place empty of all and you just wind up with the the chi the church well that's not to my understanding i don't want to do that now i believe that all god is going to reveal to you and i that's what i was getting out sunday all he's going to reveal to you and i is the all of it all right but then when we leave this world see it'll just be enough to get us there because there's going to be a message to cheer down through the endless ages the prophet said all right then uh it'll be an eternal partaking of the word of god you mean to think that you and i with our peanut brain and what little bit we know and i say a little bit and i mean that what is the word spanish petite you know or ptsd ever you know a little bit in other words put your fingers together and rub them real tight and then look between there and ain't nothing well that's about the human mind that's about the basis that we think we are in great revelation all right and see if there is a god that's for you to think about then you mean to tell me that that god would would just do what we're doing here now and not leave the place to where that we would have a wonderful opportunity in eternity to ever partake of his glorious revelation of himself amen right you know see that's that's what i'm trying to get you to see all right that we must use the words of the prophet to express what we're saying true but sometimes you have to make your own thought about it and that's what gets me sick is people will say just say what the prophet said well one brother was saying that one day and i just handed him a book i said would you mind reading that statement and he looked at it and he said i ain't going to read it it was what the prophet said you know what he said said luther dominated and died and went to hell well see he wasn't going to read that because he knew i was going to say back to him you know okay say what he says i said brother you know he's talking about the lutheran denomination not luther because there's no way luke luther could have brought the just shall live by faith and then died and went to hell even all the lutherans didn't die and go to hell or ain't you know but see then brother luis made a statement the other day that i've always thought about and he he was telling about how that you interpret and see really to interpret and may i quote him and verbatim i mean not verbatim but close that you quote by thought you don't quote literal words we say let's go to town what is spanish turns it around and says to town we go all right see it's it's impossible now if i miss that you just don't worry about it just you correct it my point is one thing that god has to reveal to us what the bible says what the prophet has said amen or we don't get it i don't care how much you quote right i mean that's wonderful that's good it's a whole lot better to be that away than to not be able to quote at all you know but just don't get to the bases until we can quote so much until that we lose the whole thought or concept that said the prophet one day said let's stand and address the third person of the trinity he believed in a trinity see there all along he believed in a trend that's the way people interpret he believed in a trinity all along he believed that and these other four thousand times that he said and believe in one god he was really trying to deceive the rest of the world well he done a good job he done a good job deceiving me because you know i believe in one true and living god what do you believe and that jesus was that god we'll get to it later made manifest in human flesh called a son wow but yet we we use the terminology and say we don't believe in eternal sonship and we don't because there's no such thing as being an eternal sonship but there was an eternal godhead amen right we gave it to you there sunday eternal godhead eternal godhead is what father son and holy ghost makes up the godhead so then you've got to have all of you got to bring all of these forms together to understand but it was like i tried to explain sunday any one of those attributes can be called the fullness right right the father was the fullness of the godhead right in jesus christ upon earth two thousand years ago dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily amen and the christ is the holy ghost which is the fullness of the godhead dwelling in you and i by the new birth now brother dale i only got it i only just got a spirit i i hope i get to a point i've told you many years ago i tried my best to say something and i seen it go out like that over your head and over mine and i said forget it but i won't forget it now because i believe the lord has given me a way to express a few things and so just bear with me and pray for me because you know uh what do you think about the person of jesus christ being in you by the baptism of the holy ghost but how do you believe that how can you explain that how can you explain that it would be possible forever 7 billion people or more in the world today that everybody in the world could have the baptism of the holy ghost if they'd receive it right now we know they won't but that's not that's not you're not getting my point i'm making it a capability all right how can you explain that how could god be divided into 7 billion persons of the baptism of the holy ghost living in you that's impossible to explain you might as well forget it but believe it amen right we believe it can be done because he can do it right all right but are you getting all the attributes of god that we had on this side over here of our line of we called eternity we're going to start tonight bringing it over a little bit over on to the other side and begin to try to understand the truth of one true and living god i gave you out some quotes and i will read down real fast because i gave them to you for you to be able to read you don't have to follow me but they are basically underlined to where you can follow we won't put them on the screen because this is what i was giving you sunday and i wanted you to keep these because remember we were talking about that god didn't send a son amen he came himself now that does away with trinitarianism amen right amen because you can't believe in eternal sonship so then the son had to be the father in another form called the son so he came himself amen all right think about it the god who's reaching mercy that was an eternal atonement because god came himself god came himself in the form of sinful flesh to make an eternal atonement an eternal atonement revelation of jesus christ what'd he say take an old testament type name the garden when the first news came to glory that the son adam had been lost did god send an angel did he send a son did he send another one like unto us no he came himself to redeem the lost son hallelujah god did not entrust his plan of salvation to another he trusted only himself well my brother you just tie me up because the father could trust a son he could if he was the son no you said well well you you walk on thin ice i love thin ice because you're going to walk soft on thin ice you know you know if it's thick you go boom but if you want thin house you're gonna yeah right and that to me is the way the word is all right think about it that day on calvary god had required it no man was worthy no man was able no man could do it and god came himself and was made human and lived in a human under human desires he says he even died as a god in human flesh was dying conferences he said that god had with man he came himself he didn't trust it to somebody someone else when god came down to redeem man he never trusted to a prophet he came himself for he was the only one that could do it right god's provided way he never sent some servant he came himself up and down in the garden of screaming adam adam where art thou god's provided way of approach to fellowship god never sent an angel he came himself he came himself to perfection he was nothing less than almighty god hid in human flesh he came himself to offer his own blood well now like i said sunday night so you lock in on well that was when he came down in flash you know well the one right back up above there he's talking about running around in the garden hunting his son because remember back there is where he first came into being right you mind this let's see if i can find this i love to keep looking in a message called the pillar of fire 1953 now the bible teaches us that the logos went out of god or i might say all the god becoming his first body the logos went out of god they come in his first body form what about it see if you get into the message it'll just keep on opening up what are you following me god came himself he says on having the conferences that he came himself it was a man-sized job a god-sized job and he says on questions and answers on genesis in other words adam the first man in the lord creation the first creation was god himself i don't understand that you can't understand that you better ask for a revelation because you've got to realize then that all of this has got to be the one god coming down to be revealed all right then what does he say on and thy seed shall possess the gate to the enemy talk about in the garden and now jesus who was he he come hunting this first lost son did god sent an angel he came himself he came himself now i like this one so we'll use that part on the message jehovah jireh preached in 61 and another thing did you notice god's never sent an angel down to hunt up his lost child he came himself that's the reason jesus reasoned that jesus was made why where he could pay the price right right or he could pay the price all right then we got into a little thought our sunday that i don't want you to lose and we started using the quote from the prophet where he said a part of god went out and that just blows the human mind doesn't it because there's no way to comprehend a part of god going out because you're trying to lose empty leave empty spaces and trying to move things around and it won't work but it's like i tried to explain it you know the bible says eternal godhead can be understood by the things we see all right as a human being i can be in my home in one room with my wife and i'm a husband i can move over into the next room and there's one of the kids you know the children and i'm a father and then i can move over into the next room and there's one of the grandkids and i'm a grandfather i can move into the next room and there's one of the great grandkids right now to each one of them i'm the fullness to them because my wife can't have another husband or another something she's got to relate to the point of me my kids can't have another as wondering about the father the grandkids can't wonder about the granddad you getting it so each one can be a fullness of doing but then as far as what is to relationship to me that's only a part because in the next room it's a part in the next room is a park well i can't be god that can remain here as this form and let another form go out to be part and then let another part come out to be another part of god i can't do that because i'm limited to that being but there's one thing for sure as i start from father i mean from husband huh you know that everything that away is increasing my ability or expanding me right right my children come into being that's expanding me the grandkids come into being that's expanding me the dna can prove it the grandkids and if it went on the great and the great and the great and the great grace each one of those would be an expanding of the one person back there right well see god has the ability to be able to be in all of those places at the same time amen but what are you going to explain it with because if you move it all over here you've left a hole and you move all of that over here that's me moving you know but god is not that away all that goes out of god from the beginning that away no matter how far it would expand itself through savior healer uh logos speech word it's an expansion it expands him it makes him greater it doesn't diminish or leave something off because seeing god apart can be the fullness but we human mortals can't be that away right amen but we ought to be able to understand it all right look what he says on the unveiling of god he's talking about his arm went off that's the word key word for uh vomit up see it would mean like his arm went off or his eye went out another person all right that is he changed himself he poured himself into amen into another mask into another form not another person went out of hymn called the holy spirit but it was he himself just because he created the world you see we in our peanut brain want to make a story and stories don't work in bible terminologies you know what i mean you could tell a story to help but you can't write a story but look what he goes on to say he himself poured himself into the people christ in you all right then we got on down into what the message was hebrews chapter 1. and he's talking about that that great that was jehovah that was jehovah god and now as the theologians call it a theophany went from that which was called in the scriptural the logos the logos that went out of god it's hard to explain but it was a part of god right now see you've got to argue with him you're not going to argue with me i don't have enough sense to argue with you about it you don't have enough sense to argue with me see we've got to accept what's said and pray for revelation amen now he's not talking about an arm going out see that's what we say park there goes an arm okay that's the sun okay over here is the sun that's an armpit there goes another arm and that's logos ovian floating around that's holy ghost floating around and look over to god and he's missing all these parts that ain't even common sense if you'll get what i said a moment ago it will really help you the more this thing expands brother let's see what a brother more called it was it the expanding of god expanding of god that was 1971 probably and i really enjoyed it god expanded himself every day he expands more of himself it doesn't move anything from here over to here it's expanding it just like husband father grandfather great grandfather that's not doing away with that's an expanding that's going out further opening up more right amen he says the great that was jehovah he calls him the theophany called him the logos that went out of guard it's hard to explain but it was part of god right well i'll tell you what boy you all y'all really are messed up well i'd like to hear you explain it i've heard the three trinity concepts haven't you i've heard the oneness concepts and thoughts and they're not able to put it together yeah but but you're dividing up parts and that's what we think we think the holy ghost is and that was one of the explanations for the monkey is like a pie and you you cut it up and you give out the pieces and when you do you wind up with no pie now that's about as carnal as you can get because even him could stand there one day and take a fish and hound out a fish and hand out a fish and hand out a fish hand out a fish every time he looked back put his hand there was another fish but you see that's what we think and we think we've got it all figured out or as we get to as i always say to you do we need to understand these things well we need the simple form of salvation we need to get the people saved you know it's kind of odd how brother branham could preach some of the deepest messages he's ever preached and the people would weep themselves to the altar children and all he said but we need salvation i'm trying my best to preach salvation because if you don't understand one god how are you going to get saved may i ask you a question six months down the road preaching i guess let me ask you a simple question as i said a while ago how can you have the person i liked the other day because i i watched the videos and see i go this way and odd part i'm right-handed you notice wade left-handed he goes this way we're going to get this figured out one of these days which way to go but think about it a simple question how many people are the inside of you right now would it be odd for the prophet to say brother is it hard to believe that there's another person inside of you right see what is the soul of man what is the soul of man look what he said on who is this 1950. and that was the logos that went out of god in the beginning that was the son of god that came out of the bosom of the father that was what was in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us in the beginning was god then out of god came the logos a part of god that went out of god be number 13 on your pages a part of god that went out of god now i thought we were supposed to be dependent upon the prophet's wording and the definitions and the interpretations and et cetera is that true we we none of us have any right to self-interpret the word of god i don't care who you are i don't give a hoot how long you hunted and fish with the prophet because i'll even put it this way the prophet had a right never had a right of self-interpretation come on get it right he didn't have a right of self-interpretation because he brought the wrong interpretation you want an example of it because i know you don't like for me to use them but you know that before the fields broke he believed the white horse rider was the holy ghost you know what that was that was brother branham self-interpretation right you see how easy it can be i got it somewhere in the notes were brought around and said as a little kid i used to think that jesus loved me and god hated me you remember that one man a prophet he said until i found out there's a self-same person but see look what i'm getting at the message the curtain of time 56 god which was a part of god and god seen what the end would be from the beginning and the logos come to the earth which was christ the word spoken word of god part of god and was made flesh and dwelt among us look what he says on the message at thy word i believe that even the holy spirit and angels and all these are just attributes of god it's just a part of god it's his makeup it's part of that went off his spirit and so forth that he created to be his helpers apart questions and answers on genesis talks about that little eye supernatural that we can see logos or anointing as i was going to say the part of ghent god began to develop into something so that human beings could have some type of idea what it was may i make my statement had god not cain came come little english words you know had god not come the way that he did do you think we could have ever understood any other way do you think there's any other way that it could have been done well now now brother branham should have said this he should have said that well you know what i'm not following you man because the way he said it was the perfect way or else what he said that god couldn't have another plan said he had only one plan he had only one thing one doing he couldn't do it he said well it should have been done this way well you know what we needed you before we needed god sorry to be sarcastic is that true if you and i can straighten out a profit or straighten out god we evidently must be greater than god well brother dale we know we don't do that well why do we play with the words would you explain you come up here and explain the things that i've said sunday in that god didn't trust it with nobody else he came himself he didn't send a son he didn't send an angel he didn't send another one like us he came himself all right then take it that it was a part of him that went out to create that it's a part of him that lives in you by the baptism of the holy ghost go home take your computer type in part of god you'll find some pretty good quotes in there that i didn't cover because i don't have time to but are you listening not another person not another person god came himself you know brother random said he sent back his soul in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost and he said when that's passed out in other words paraphrasing the word when it's divided out it'll be finished his soul what is a soul oh it's just the nature of the spirit there's no such word i challenge the two soul people on that one people that are around the world today teaching that message saying that brother branham said the soul is just the nature of the spirit i want one quote for that sound brother brown said the soul is the nature of the spirit because when you say just you're making it something that is not you well you're just being sarcastic amen but when we get up to heaven one of these days you'll thank me for being sarcastic you might find out it might be the holy spirit see then that's what you got to worry about all right but now watch let me get a little part of what i want to get to what is a nature what is a nature a nature is what anything is bird dog has the nature of a bird dog cow nature of a cow horse whatever animal the nature of that but what about a nature you know if we see this correctly i believe we'll be able to understand some things that has been withholding from us for quite a while wrote around says how do you know his nature he said you watch it how do you know the nature of anything you watch it you know then that way i can do as he said that if you can't see christ in every verse of the bible he said go back and read it again you missed it well what is christ the nature of god no it's the anointing well praise the lord i'm glad you said that because anointing is what a nature is if not tell me how come the bird dog comes into the world pointing who taught it come on you don't teach the word dog to point you teach him what to do about it you know not to run the birds off and thing but he comes into the world and he'll just walk out through there and all at once he'll just heal this point that's his nature and see well the way i see it i can follow the nature of god all the way through the bible and not have to change that nature in any way to fit a point or a doctrine or a thought and i can see his nature all the way through the word then i can see when jesus christ came he had the very nature that's right oh god you remember as i said a moment ago but one said i thought as a child that jesus loved me and god hated me he said until i found out you're the self-same person when there's not a nature of the father it's mean and arrogant boy just kidding i just you know into the nature of the sun is sweet and humble and then what kind of one you're going to give the holy ghost you know if the holy ghost is not the nature of the father then what kind of what have you got and if the father is not the nature of the son what do you got nature let us make man in our nature oh you changed that let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let them amen not just adam and jesus and brother branham there's one big man in this message he said he said the third pool was for jesus and brother branham and we're just riding along well i remember where the prophet said the third pool was for the bride and for the church and to the totally lost so you know which one i'm going to please right but what about it image likeness is what genesis 1 26 can't be something made in the image of it as we think because you're making a duplicate you know no um can't be that image is what anything is right likeness is what anything is god didn't have any problems saying let us make man in our own image in our own likeness because he was going to make man in the nature that he was will you go with that he's going to make man in his own nature her image which doesn't mean as another person genesis 1 26 the spiritual manner 27 the physical man is in two genesis 1 26 and 27 is a spiritual man created in the image of a spiritual god now let's get it right if our thoughts of the godhead is correct that it's not father son holy ghost blessed trinity three gods or whatever it's god moving over in another form to reveal itself well see then if he creates man in his own image what image was the man in the garden the prophet said he was a spiritual being he said he even ruled the animals he named those animals in that spiritual supernatural being now what happened to that spiritual being i thought that genesis 1 was put into genesis 2. that's that's what i thought or how many genesis you got and that genesis 1 was placed into genesis 2 and then that made adam in complete control of the garden and all of the things see we're not looking at it in the order that we need to be looking at it let us create man in our own image let them have dominion all right little branham says there he said he created man he said not a man he created man in his own image all right that man was god in another form told you we're gonna have to do some thinking or else he was not in the image of god if he was in the image of god then it would have the man that he created would have to be god in another form or where did he change no no now well i want you to explain it i want you to explain how you become a child of god i thought a child of god was god in another form i thought a son of god was god in another form what do you think right well that's that's just a little bit too much brother dale on to that human being i ain't talking about that human being as human being you're looking at was made in the image of a buyer and a horse and a dog and a donkey and anything in the world you want to make it but inside is a man if we have the new birth that is in the image of god which i thought paul said that it was christ in you the hope of glory i thought the prophet explained that the new birth was christ coming and living in us in the person of jesus christ brother they'll the way you're bringing it's going to be crowded you know what i mean you just keep cutting too much in just saying what the bible says you tell me some other way see what you believe if you really get down to it you believe you are a child of jesus which was a child of god i believe jesus was god made manifest in human flesh and i believe by the new birth that we are god made manifest in the human flesh now if you don't believe that's right i want to know what's right then now we'll back up a step then you know what none of us can be the fullness so you know what we are apart amen apart and you know what i'm a part of you and you're part of me and we're part of each other and you know all together we make up the body of christ what are you talking about are you talking about another god that makes this or a father son in holy ghost some way to make it come out to a story no i believe it's the most beautiful story that's ever been that's right it's the story of redemption and then i have no problems with brother branham in what he says that all souls was created before the world i have no problems with what is it is it deuteronomy 18 4 all souls are mine and you know that even a sinner because we were all that and what why don't we want to be such a great big thing what's the difference in us in the center the new birth because we all begin as lost amen the only difference is the new birth see because we all come from god even a sinner come from god it's all had to come from god but around you is the word permitted because we were all permitted to come into the world lost what are you thinking about you see what i'm driving at that all of those attributes all of those things is the condescending of god and whatever we are remember the bible says it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people want the sheep of his pastor ever what we are god made us all right then why do we have any trouble with his nature he said yeah but brother dale an anointed one has his nature i differ with you i differ with you soully they do not have his nature they have his anointing because his nature is his being amen if they had his being they wouldn't be called anointed ones they would be the true anointed ones which would be his children his offspring but we don't think about the new birth see i'm trying to lay down a part all right then we'll get back because i just literally insert and then go down and then get over later about his nature i will go ahead and and express the words where you'll at least think that i know i'm going somewhere the nature of your soul is god if you're born again that's on souls in prison but said if not it's of the world i quoted that to a two soul man one time and he said how can a nature have a nature i said i don't know why don't you talk to the prophet that's what i said i said because he's once said it right amen he said the nature of your soul is god if you're born again if not it's of the world it's pretty easy to follow the worldly nature through the bible right right right now i mean you follow the worldly nature through the bible from the genesis of the council sin and and the building of the towers and doing the things the ark the covenant you know that but what about following god's nature see his nature was back there but was never been able it was never able to be displayed the way he wanted it in the old testament because he was fighting the nature of man and he could not convert the man so he had to come remember the quote didn't trust another he had to come himself to make a way if he could change our nature what does it mean to take the nature of a hog out and put the nature of a pig in we quote that a lot don't we but we only quote that if you take the hog's nature out put the nature of the you know and put in the nature of a lamb that the lamb will go up on the hill and eat grass right why he still looks like a hog he still smells like a hog right he still makes pork chops he don't make lamb chops it don't change a bit of the taste of the animal right are you following me it changes the nature of the animal now what is the nature of that animal so evidently a hog has a nature and a pig i mean a lamb has a nature and what is that nature but you know man has a nature right and you know the reason man has a nature because god has a nature and he's created in the image of god so he has a nature about him now what is that nature how can you have within you your own self and god at the same time of course you know what a lot of people want to do they want to take out all samuel dale you know and throw him away and put god in well you know what that don't make samuel right that means god you just goofed up you got to leave samuel dale and then you got to give him eternal life was eternal life just uh okay there it is she this this is me one drop it's eternal the only way you can get eternal and i'm saying this for later you're going to catch on is to get the nature of god you got to get a pig transplant right you're going to get a transplant from a pig to a lamb right that's right still look like a pig smell like a pig and to some degree you're going to act like a pig but inside of you is the nature of the lamb but remember if you just take something out and shove something in that's not a hog anymore i don't care what it looks like it's a lamb if that's the way you're going you want to go to what's going to find out when it gets old in the philippines they're going to take you my turn say wait do you want some roasted pig and he's going to say yes so we'll go down to this place where they roast the pig and what does a pig look like to me and you a little round plump thing with short legs and a snout and a body you know and when he walks out there he's going to look up there and they're going to say you want some of that pig and he says that ain't no big because you know what they're pigs now they got pigs but you know what their basic pig looks like a scant down germans a skin down uh bulldog one of the taller bulldog forms not the old chunky going down more or less the taller looking pug knows bulldogs i don't know what you call them but that's what you look just like well he's going to wonder what nature that thing's got but you see folks the nature of god has to be in the man that's right and then when it does it's no longer you living it's christ living in you and then one of these days we're going to realize it i'm going to quit right here one of these days we're going to realize all of these words brother branham used and you'll find out that i've been deliberately leading you up to a certain place to where i could say certain things and one of those things is is that your soul is your theophany that's what brother branham said now you're gonna have to argue with him you see we're going to find out one of these days this whole story of redemption is true brother branham says emphatically from about 64 on 63 strongly emphatically if you wasn't over there you'll never be over there right you know what if he hadn't come from there we wouldn't be here at all you mean are you going to try to get into self-existence right i believe in self-existing i believe god is self-existing i believe the eternal life you have today existed in god before the world ever begun that's self-existing then that's not self-existing as of me because remember even the body of jesus wasn't self-existing so get away from that and get to thinking about the things your prophet had to say if i'd said the things if you had said the things to me ten years ago or whatever that i've said to you in the past three or four services my wife can tell you when i came into the message it was no problem because you've heard me tell the story of listening to or reading six books in one day and listening to two tapes i rejected my family i set aside myself to learn what the prophet had to say i read constantly i i meditated i wrote notes i wrote great books of things the prophet had said we didn't have a concordances like you have we didn't have none of those things and we would take a tape recorder and we'd write down what the prophet said and to do that you'd be surprised how many words you're going to miss if you think you can ride as fast as brother branham talks and keep the thought i invite you to try it and then go back and read the tape i mean go back and read your notes your notes and turn the tape back and listen to what he said but we done that to try to have the message even the doctrinal quotes and the things of the quote books that were put out i got everyone i could get because it may have been 10-15 pages to prove their point but they had a lot of quotes in there that was right well you know what i have no problems with getting their book i still got some of them my point is it stirred up within you anything to think about attributes son of god logos theophany's the thing the prophet has expressed to us has it stirred that up to you until you desire to listen to tapes i've told you i was not going to ask how many has even read or listened to questions and answers on genesis and i'd probably say three quarters of people in the building have not done it and i just simply ask you to because that's a great message to explain it explaining the creation of things i know all about it okay okay i pray to god you do i pray that you know all about it as i said while ago do we need to know these things well do we need to know the truth on one true and living god right to know who you are how many of you had your ideas that all god was he poured into christ nothing over there all christ poured into church nothing over there you see sometimes it takes somebody to come along just jog you a little bit get you to thinking get you to thinking that's all i'm trying to do is get you to think about who you are because we've reached a thing now talking about what let us make man in our own image and to know that whatever god he is you and i must be there or we're not in his image because he didn't make the physical man in his image he made the spiritual man in his image and you know what you take out the spiritual man and stand him over here in a form called a theophany you know what he looks like you look like you right think on these things what do you think about one true and living god what do you think about the end time and what you and i have received amen to know the truth shall set you free but do we need to know all of these things about god you don't want to know about god you don't understand what your thinking is when you say that when you would think well do we need to know all about god we need to know all about god that we can understand on this side because one of these days we're going to be on another side and you know what i don't believe foolish virgins will know what we know about god when we get over there so if you don't want to know about god might you might be degrading yourself to a foolish virgin that doesn't want to know am i right the foolish virgins can't be the bride of jesus christ come on did the prophet say he whispers secrets to his little bride that the rest don't hear they may hear words they may hear tapes but they don't hear in their heart think on these things let's stand he never sent a son he came himself so the one that was the creator that we covered sunday that the bible says all things were made by jesus christ and without him was not anything made that was made hebrews 1 john 1 colossians 1 revelations 4 james 3. in the beginning was the word the word with god in the word was god and all things were created by him who the word and jesus christ was that word think on these things what about his nature what about the statement that the soul is the nature of the spirit he didn't say the soul is the spirit he said the soul is the nature of the spirit well now that nature has got to be greater than a spiritual part you know what a main spirit or it's not the real you i know i'm throwing out a lot of things but i'm throwing them out to where that you in your mind it'll be recorded and then when you read and listen to the message you'll say there it is that's what he said see because it takes god to reveal it see what the prophet said we need is what he said we need a nature change is that true he said it wasn't your soul that died he said it was the nature of your soul it's what died that's soul's in prison what about it church what do you think about god and what do you think about who you are and i thought brother branham said when the bride realizes who she is that satan will be powerless before but we don't want to know who we are we just want to go go to church and be good and rejoice and you know well if we'd have been over brother show and so we just been running the aisles and shouting glory hallelujah okay let's go over there i said no problem church wouldn't build over the basis of begging nobody to come here you come here by your own free moral agency choice go ahead brother what we got 172 spiral the sun it will never go down it will never go down the flowers are blooming foreign just simply talking about one god just simply talking about a new verse foreign i the flowers are blooming in that city after
