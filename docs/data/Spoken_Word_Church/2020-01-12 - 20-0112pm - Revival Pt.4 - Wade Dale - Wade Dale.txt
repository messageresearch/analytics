School teachers anybody that teaches Sunday School will try to figure out Saturday or Sunday one of the two days just for about 10 or 15 minutes and go over some things I was telling somebody the other day I don't want to use this loosely but this place has become like a submarine it's a long tube with two floors and a lot of people in it so they put thousands of people in a submarine and it's just a little round tube so we're gonna have to learn how to adjust and move and maybe one shift come out while the other shift comes in and but thank God and for what brother Dale was saying this morning I just want to add one thing to it is just we've never had this influx of young people number one and we've had you know 90 or 100 come every once in a while and then it drew a little down to 50 or 60 or 75 but but we're clocking 90 to 100 ever service now so and I say this loosely that's the hundred problems like brother down and you know little church little problems big church big problem well we just we try to do the best we can with what we've got what I'm trying to say and we're trying our best to get together and move things around and figure out how we how will survive this submarine trip for about eight hours on a Sunday hey man so let's just all be sailors and let's all just move out of the way and let the other sailor go through we didn't quit uh standing around and we always like to stand down there right where you go into brother boy Sunday School class so regina's here she'd tell you she said I that's just a place everybody stands we don't we don't need to stand there and we need to move out of the way and let people do their job but god bless you let's go to Psalms 85 but we just need to bear with each other we're we're living in a time that I told you if all them people downstairs start coming in that we're praying diligently that they do then we will be having to have two services in morning and two in the afternoon I really doesn't bother me and I know it doesn't brother bother brother Dale to get everybody in here because we want to take this ship home and ships nothing without its members as ships nothing without the people in it it'll just float on its own and it'll kind of drift everywhere but if you've got somebody that's it - at the helm that knows where he's going knows what he's doing if you got people that are doing their job and doing what they're supposed to do then that ship will go exactly where that we that guard leads in in gaad's us - and it won't be a it won't be a wreck God does not have wrecks we have wrecks Satan may cause you to wreck but God don't cause wrecks hey man God wants us to travel on so Psalms 85 person let's bow our heads Damelin father we thank you today for giving us an opportunity to stand before the greatest people in the face of the earth many people spend many hours traveling to many places to see these stars of the world and stars of sports and stars and many different things but I'm looking at one group of people that inside of them today is the creator of the stars and what a great privilege it is to stand here in front of them Lord and to be able to use the gift that you give us to convey convey your love to them because that's what it is Lord is your love for us father just give us this day our daily bread be with each one Lord bless us says we go to the baptismal service Lord that you'll shine your light down on each one of us Lord as we were talking with sister Cathy you know talking about going from the head to the heart we want it to drop down into that heart to where we can where the Holy Ghost is and the Holy Ghost can lead us and guide us into all truth Father forgive us of our sins bless us take care of the ones that are sick with us today and the ones that are not here people sister Regina Lord and the grand baby being born all the different ones has needs we pray that you would just minister to each one father give us this day our daily bread and Jesus name we pray amen Psalms 85 verse 1 to the chief musician musician a psalm for the son of Korah now that's been favorable to the land now it's brought back the captivity of Jacob they´ll has forgiven the iniquity of the people they'll has covered all their sins si la del has taken away all thy wrath thou has turned ourselves from the fierceness of thine anger turn us O God of our salvation and caused on anger toward us decease wilt thou be angry with us forever now this is the Old Testament under blood of bulls and goats but this is also David under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit telling the people that God is going to bring them back amen wilt thou be angry with us forever without draw out thine anger to all generations wilt thou not revive us again that night people may rejoice in thee show us thy mercy O Lord and grant us thy salvation 2nd chronicles 7 excuse me verse 14 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves everybody got that same man and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their lands now the land we're talking about is not the land out there this is the land this is the kingdom of God this is the land that we're talking about the earth right now mine eyes shall be open and my ears a tent unto the prayer that is made in this place for now have I chosen and sanctified I want everybody take their finger and do this right here turn it like this and point it right here hold it right there while I read this for now I have chosen this sanctified this house that my name may be there forever we are mrs. Jesus Christ we are the bride that's what he's already told us we should need to start believing it that my name may be there forever and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually you may be seated in the Lord bless him to the reading of the word god bless your hearts it'll be very long today cuz we got a baptismal service and man I love baptismal services and you know what I I think that we might have another one we gonna give you plenty of time we got plenty of towels we're right there sister Lisa's house and she's so gracious to to let us get into the baptismal pool and I am sure we will find something for you to wear if you want to be baptized amen so you just think on these things and if you have a if you have a situation where you are not sure you need to get sure a man because this revival that we're talking about now sure it's not going to be a worldwide revivals and I'm gonna be a revival that that the whole world is gonna come to spoken word church with their cameras in there you're not gonna see WSB and and almost different trucks outside with their satellites on but these people are having that's not promised it's promised to be a secret but it will be a revival it will be something that you and I will benefit from looky brothers like black he's already benefited so let's all benefit from this let's all I you know there's many times before we I think brother Joe told me that that we didn't have any baptism in 2019 now may be wrong but I don't think we did but before that several years you'd have four or five and then you'd have a group of six and then you have a group of eight and then then you'd have a group that the three or four and then it would it was kind of Wayne you know and not have one for kind of bad that we went the whole year without having a baptismal service but still we're only eleven days in the tree into January and we got three coming up so God's on the move listen he's in his bride and his Brides gonna move with him because he is her headship he moves she moves with him how's that six one this is where I want to mmm we're gonna talk today a little bit about zeal who's there six one says come and let us return it to the Lord for heaith torn and he will heal us he hath smitten and he will bind us up after two days after two days after two thousand years Christ came on the earth two thousand years ago and brought us a message he brought us a revival that has been going on in the bride since the day of Pentecost all right and it's going on but when I would listen as we were talking last Wednesday night there's revivals that have come and then the revival fires started dying then God would bring another messenger and the revival fires would go back up again and then they would it was a cycle I don't ever forget brother and why I still remember this but brother Matthew Lord now from South Carolina Watkins Thank You Matthew Watkins about ten years ago came here and preached a sermon called cycle of a revival I don't know if you remember that or not but I did but that cycle is continuing on but listening we're not you and I we're after this two days we're after that promise of the two thousand years of one church age coming and a minister coming and then he brings his message and then then everybody dies off and all kind of isms and schisms get into the get into the church and then God sends somebody else to bring it back up and bring a revival and that was happy that happened seven or now eight times going after Pentecostal now this is not a cyclo folk we're either going down or we're going up and then there's not going to be that's another cycle to where we can throw this message to where well all I need to do is just half way live it because they somebody come in little this is it after two days he will revive us now Witney brother George Quinn same God's Word has to come to pass he spoke it and it has to come to pass so after two days will he revived us in the third day he will raise us up and we show living his site showing that this age is calling for a resurrection not a dying and somebody else coming there's not listen the next group to come is 144,000 Jews that's the next group there is no other group coming that's God going to the Jews to to prophets so you and I can't throw it on to anybody else one more time take your finger like this whose problem is it right there you go because you're in the third day you're in that three you're after the 2000 years you're in the time now this is not a cycle of revival this is it there's no cycle this is it you know you can cycle through a lot of things you can take clothes and run them through a cycle but there's got to be a time when you get them clothes out of the washing machine because they're clean and that's what we're looking at now let's read this number number one I took the other one out this is one that sister Esther Broughton I really appreciate that because what's what what's what brother brown this is recognizing your day in this message can everybody see that can you see it in the back cuz I want to read this all of us read it together okay now recognizing you're Dennis message brother branham is praying God created me or me a revival let me be the revival let each one of us be the revival the revival in me make me Lord to hunger make me Tudor's created me Lord that what is needed in me not your brother in me let me from this our own be done more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more able more humbler more kinder more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive and forgetting the things that are in the past and the negatives hello let me press toward the mark of the high calling of Christ amen amen amen because that's exactly what we're looking at we are looking at this cycle of revival that is not going to cycle anymore everybody got that created me a revival I think the devil stole one of my one of my notes bhudev oh well whatever he did that's okay y'all got part of it in there anyway don't you I think I took a piece of it back there but listen what we're doing here why are we here that's my question why are we here we are here to number one as we were talking like this morning in the Sunday school class we are here to stay fortified behind the Word of God and then we are here to not cower down you bring number two up now cower down to the devil right we are here to stay because what happened to Eve and one de nieve didn't have the word she had the word she was fortified behind the word as long as she stayed there but what your brother Brown say Eve came out from behind the protection of the word and that's when Satan got her but now if we're gonna have a word revival then we got to get back behind that word regardless of what anybody says regardless of how you feel it didn't say how you feel it said do you believe amen so we've got to be a believing group of people let's read number two the angel of the Lord and when we see these crowds together and that doesn't mean revival that's just gathering but a revival is when people get really right with God and pray through that black prayed through what's our problem I'm more using because you know what hits fresh we love fresh meat we love things that are fresh we liked an influx of fresh people why because as we get older and God knows it as we get older we get more likes and we get more well you know but a revival is when people get really right with God and pray through and starts to a revival throughout the city and everything you see they put away sin put away their iniquity turn to God turn around and start back again going down the road let's go to number three resurrection of laughter brother I feel real good about it anyhow what this church needs today is a good revival not a new doctrine or a new order just the stirring up of what you already know about now listen like sister Kathy was though we were talking about revelation we've got it packed up here for years and maybe not for some but four years we got it packed up here you know God promised an eleventh-hour worker would get paid the same amount of money as somebody that worked 11 hours and he only worked one hour because that's the agreement that's what God dudes does the 11th hour worker when that 11th hour worker comes in God just packs it all in because he's not gonna leave you here for your child or of his but just as throwing up of what you already know about but let's get it from here down to here and I was telling sister Kathy really what happens is is you're not taking it from here to here the Holy Ghost is down here reaching up and getting what you've got and brings it down and anoint it because if you put it from here to here that's you doing it you can't put it from here to here cuz that's the problem we keep it here we try to put it down here but when the Holy Ghost remember the Bible tells us that the Holy Ghost will lead you and guide you into all truth all truth not part all truth so he because remember what you take in now get this when you take something in you're taking the word of God in now is that false no its truth the Word of God is true but the letter killeth if you don't get a revelation if the Holy Ghost you got doesn't reach up and get that and bring it down into that inner part of you and then what quickens it because what happened on the day of Pentecost what happened the day two days before Pentecost know what happened eleven days before Pentecost Peter and all them had it up here right they had nothing down here to reach and get it so they ran from the Lord the Lord told him I'm your Peter I'll I'll cut the note Jesus said I got to die alone I packed it in you Lord st. John 17 I've sanctified them I have breathed on them and told them you know what they're gonna do and the things are gonna do it's all up here Lord but there was nothing down here to reach and get it but on the day of Pentecost when that pillar of fire come down and I don't believe it set on it but I believe it went right on in them and that fire went into here what he do it drugged all that that they knew and it quickened it and what's the first thing Peter said Peter step down he says this is that what do you do he went right to the Word of God he said this is that that was promised now he didn't say that two days ago he didn't say that 11 days ago he was scared to death but he stepped out throw the door open and said this is that this is what we've been waiting the whole world's been waiting on this right here the whole world's been waiting on you to be here today the whole world's been waiting on you to come to this service oh we just here for nothing I mean we're just here in haphazard and you know we we just showed up at church one day and God don't run his business look down let's go to number four now a minister cannot bring a revival even though we stand here we holler we clap we go hey y'all it cuz it does you no good until it quickens what you got there's no preacher can bring a revival he doesn't pack it with him I wish we did we just hand it out and the only thing to do is just be loyal to God and His Word we got a loyal pastors been Lord the Lord where it's being you we're the problem take your finger pointing like this who's your problem thinking okay the revival has to come by the people in your home in your life and a revival isn't adding new members to the church that's okay if it does its reviving that what you've already got your revive means to bring back and as we showed you the the definition I don't know if it's the next one or not but it's to what it's not to today today we're not going to the number five anyway today we're going to a baptism of service now if you are born again you can get born again before you get baptized happened in the book of Acts I just got finished reading the book of Acts cuz I wanted to read the book of Acts cuz that was the greatest revival that ever started among a group of people and it was 120 in the upper room and they weren't preachers yet hello the revival started when they took what they had and went out into the world and created a revival that still to now till now we're feeding on that same revival but you and I are not gonna cycle through another preacher though cycle through another star in other words another prophet we had one prophet the next prophet that hits the earth is going to Israel there's not another major prophet so you and I in the days of the voice of the seventh angel what we need today is an old-fashioned God's that revival clean up the home clean up the art get things ready are we doing that have you walked in your house and you know that's not it's not clean tonight you should not have anything in there really this you that you need to hide or throw away or okay because you know God visits when nobody else does okay all right but what's he saying clean up the home clean up the heart in other words get everything in order men be men women be women that's a quote brother I'm telling if men will start being men and women start being women will have a better church they men start a revival in your home and it'll begin at the church preacher don't bring it in his briefcase I wish we could God sends it from heaven to the individuals that's true number six that's the way to get a revival it's when you really get in the spirit of revival now look not whooping it up or something in other words like I said Wednesday night we don't what I'm gonna bring in a worship team to get a revival like they're doing churches and get to I mean we got lights up here but they're not red and blue and green and we we don't have smoke I wish there's I hope it or not smoke in here they'd be a fire but you know how they have all that stuff while they're doing they tried to build people up fleshly fleshly emotions we're talking about a word revival with a word inside of you it's going to revive and do exactly what it said because God's Word will always come to pass not whooping it up or something but by praying it down until there's a revival strikes your heart until all the logs of ecclesiastic says and all the logs of fanaticism and all the laws of system and all the logs of unbelief flows out then the waters of God comes falling down upon you never waters waters waters is revival all right comes falling there you are all right let's go to number seven hey by all rights Amen Oh Christian people this is 1948 old Christian people bind yourself together with one heart in one court for God cannot no more send the gifts to the church why do you think we don't have gifts that's why for God cannot no more send the gift to the church while the church is separated he saw brother Dale he's talking about denominations is he this is the only church I'm dealing with this is the only church you should deal with I'm not worried about what's going on out there while the church is separated then he can send the Holy Ghost unless you're in one accord so he can't send the Holy Ghost he can't send the gift if for 91 accord that's right for it comes by the Holy Ghost believe it he said how do I know I have the Holy Ghost what's in you agrees with the word word by word and causes a word revival inside of you that you press play when you need to you come to church when you're supposed to I said that right press play when you want to come to church when you have need to which is ever signed in and all that but because we're going to talk about something in a few minutes that we've never talked about before it's called zeal it's called zeal the zeal of the people but I want you to see the wisdom of a prophet because there were people in the Bible calls elux and they were zealous about what they were doing so jealous they would kill people paul was a zealot before he was born again he had a zeal to kill right he they only kill people now that was wrong the seal was okay but he used it wrong but I tell you what brother Brown said in just a few minutes all right let's go to number eight and when the revival comes looks what always comes when he comes to today of Jesus just in the minority just a few people just a few people look like John have their own the bangs just a few people the greatest prophet ever come on the face of the earth but before Jesus introduced the Messiah they turned him down just a few people gathered around from the region's roundabouts to hearing about 99 percent of them rejected his message and walked away yet it was a great revival in a shaking time God shakes things and people don't realize it's being done I want you to think about that because we're listening we're human beings we're looking for an emotion we're looking for a great light to come down as human beings we would love to have that who feeling well I can do the same thing with an ice cube down the back of your neck and you'll be running up down this aisle trying to get the thing out of you how do you close right and then ain't be no God no where but when you can take and fortify yourself behind the Word of God and realize that God's Word will come to pass and it's going to come to pass in you ain't not your neighbor in you when it's going to come in you that's the shape listen brother I've said to make the devil shake it's to live the Word of God you can sit there and talk all you want to and we can spew and spout and bla bla bla we want to but if you live a good Christian life Satan does not know what to do with that because remember if you mess up that means you what you come out from behind the word brother branham said Satan can't get in but you can come out and he can get into your house not all the way down to the soul but he can get into this house and he can Greek have it God shakes things and people don't realize this being done see God shakes his church the revival is to his church I believe the church is called out now roll that back then what's the what's the date on the Oaks 19 what is it 1961 1961 God brother Brown got through brother Brown says I believe the church is called out now but the thing to revive us is to revive and shake that church to its place again you and I have a position to come to and that's where we can have power and character we've got the power brothers and sisters if you've got the Holy Ghost in your soul you can create a world and go live on it but what are you going to do with it when God releases the power and you're just a baby give the baby the car keys oh let's take all these kids that are under about 8 years old and give them all your car keys let them go outside turn the cars on you better not be out there what's it going to be a disaster but now the same set of keys in the same car we all came in with one we know what to do with it that's what God has been for 50 years trying to train us and guide us how to use and grab his vehicle call the Word of God because if we had the power without character remember what that is that's the tannic and then somebody cut you off on the side on the road what you'd want as Apple mount of existence but if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost what makes it different you want you bet you pray for that person don't forgive them they don't know what they're doing and there's a lot of people driving they just don't know what they're doing and by all rights Amen oh man come on that's right alright let's go to number nine remember Wednesday night load you either weren't here brother Bram tells a story about a man called Peter Cartwright their Baio case a man wake up this is worth more than your sleepy time Peter Cartwright God told him to how God told him to have a revival he goes and finds a building in town and he's washing the walls washing the windows the bully of the community with the gun and the big tall guy comes walking in and says hey buddy who are you he's in other words he said I'm Peter Cartwright what are you doing here I'm gonna have a revival that big bully says angle-angle have no revival as long as I'm here you know what said before you have a revival you got a wit me first Peter Cartwright was a Christian man let me point that out I don't know if he just got out of prison but he was a Christian man and brother Brown said he was a little man but what happened Peter Cartwright said oh I do well I'll just do that next he didn't let it linger to the next day he didn't wait til the big man got he just went about his business that's the same thing you and I need to do with the devil don't let it linger that black didn't let it linger these others don't let it linger because Satan will take your joy he will take the words you got and make it none affect grabbing by the coat walk over at least by like I know this is a preacher real nice guy why you shouldn't be acting like that preacher doing what he's doing well brother Brad was making a point Peter Cartwright took his coat off well I'll just do it next walked over there and reach the big old bully by the collar knocked him down on the floor jumped on top of me and said I must fight if I sure ain't I must fight if I should rain increase my courage Lord pounded that he didn't just take a feather and go now stop that's why I say we're doing the devil the devil comes first we go oh quit quit then pound the tar out of it how do you do it with the Word of God you can't do it on your own but God give you the word Jesus did it all by he pounded a pile the devil every day why by the Word of God pound the tar out of him said you got enough the man said yes he got up and shook his hand he got saved the next 90 church but that's what we got to do the big old devil comes and said you go have a revival cuz I'm here then what does the Holy Ghost say in you oh I gotta whip you let's just start right now we gonna whip him he's gonna get a bloody eye a bloody nose and we gonna break him all up heading our way down to the baptismal pool because we have defeated you know we need to be just do what God says just do what God said that gives him the bloody eye just do what God said that's enough don't try to do it on your own stand up and say God if nobody does and I will Peter Cartwright didn't call his friends at that time he didn't probably have any he was in a new place washing the windows get rid have a revival you know why because God told him to have a revival God's telling you tonight today have a revival see what you can do listen a lot of this right here is reversed in our case we're the ones getting beat and whipped why I must fight if I should rain maybe what brother Branham had that dream of that vision about the guy beating - beating the woman all right beating the woman and he said stop that stop that and he says he got bigger and bigger and bigger what increased my faith faith has muscles brother Brown said one time face got hair on his chest thanks pretty burly that was faith that guy had a gun on his side he'd be hard for us to do that in this day and time grab somebody by the collar with a gun in his pocket all right look at number 10 I'll tell you our nation is simply polluted there's not a hope left of this nation as I see now that's okay because we're not part of this nation sure we live in the United States greatest greatest country in the world to live and prosper in but the nation is gone pray for the people in the nation only an old-fashioned revival and according to the scripture it'll never be nationwide so we're not looking for a nationwide revival anymore it's gonna be like Peter Cartwright it was Peter cart riding the devil inside of one room and he went at it with him listen we have the devil's answer he had the devil's answer he had that man's answer he wept him so then there's just left it'll be a revival among the people the elect of God now I want to tell you something today just like I told you all the other day about Communion and foot washing it's something that Christians do it's a communion between you and God not you and your neighbor you and God if we come up and present the communion to you and you don't take it you've got a problem and it's pretty apparent that you have a problem because brother Brown said Christians will take communion that's an ordinance of God just like water baptism if you start in your Christian walk you gonna want to be baptized I wanted to be baptized even though I had been baptized when I was 12 years old in Athens or no nine years old in Athens or 10 I needed to be baptized again why because my conscious I had done all that bad for 20 years yeah I'll let the devil whip me for that length of time but when you go down to that water and you say Satan this old my hands gonna get buried today and you are not going to resurrect with it because we don't understand Satan has no power he cannot resurrect one person he can resurrect itself there's no power no way to reproduce yourself but it's to be a revival among the people the elect of God listen if you're elect of God you will be in a revival it's promised after two days but it won't be a sweeping revival take the whole nation in everyone's never will number 11 now that's the reason today this is the third seal the revivals that were supposed to have we have denominational revivals now remember this is going to be a word revival only to the bride elect of Jesus Christ in the end time right say ma'am it's not two denominations can't have a word revival you can't revive something that's already [Applause] you can resurrect something to stay that's when you get born again you're resurrecting something that's dead but the denominations have already made their choice they are dead can't be revived so yeah they'll have their revivals but what's it gonna be fleshly revivals it cannot be a word revival can't be why because there's too many errors we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no sir this is 1963 preaching the seals don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a revival know we're don't know the bride the elect that's not a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it'll take those seven unknown thunders and you boy everybody starting to go well we don't know what that is it's the plan of redemption folks it's the plan Redemption how God's gonna take you from point A to point B in your body spirit insult that's just too simple because what because what's gonna wake you up what's gonna wake you up when you realize who you are when you realize what you're doing here why you're here and that you're right in this very plan of God what a wake it up he'll send it he promised it remember God's Word has to come to pass it will be a word revival it will not be a fleshly revival but we can get happy about it those that bite pretty happy right now sister Freda sister Anna butts really happy right now because you know what we're going to do something we're gonna do something that the devil or never wants you to do the devil will never tell you to go on be a Christian and be baptized no no he'll do his best to keep you out of the water amen but remember this is a pure word revival so now all right let's for just a few minutes we have the word here I'm not talked about just right here I'm talking we have the pure unadulterated word through the prophets message and that's what we preach all these brothers all the people that we have here you you've heard the Word of God okay what are we doing with it what are we doing with it I'm asking you what are we doing with it number 12 testimony on the scene 1964 and then we begin to find out miracles isn't taking place no more like they were baptism are not taking place like they were it is it because the sick go home sick it isn't because of God it's because of the lack of the revival among the people there is no revival they sit and listen go home and say well I guess that was pretty good mm-hmm there is not that zeal there is not that something in the people that should be there now what is the word zeal what does it mean let's go to the next one a couple more quotes zeal means in being our indignation which we don't want any of that but look fervent mind jealousy you say oh I don't want to be jealous God's jealous God's jealous if it's godly jealousy he said I love you with godly jealousy hey man we should love the Word of God with godly jealousy we should be jealous of anything outside of the Word of God emulation look excitement of mine ardor fervent of spirit zeal and ardour and embrace in other words an unction to embrace the Word of God pursuing the Word of God defending the Word of God Zeeland behalf of for a person or thing the fierceness of indignation Peter to zeal now look started with the zealots in the Old Testament in the New Testament they were zealous and even someone in the Old Testament they were zealous but you know what they did they over run their wisdom by their zeal but let's go to number 13 brother Graham said we will see Jesus 19:58 that enthusiasm the church today lost its enthusiasm look why cuz it's got out of the vine what's to find the Word of God I am the vine jesus said you are the branches where does the life come from come from the vine all right we've got out of the vine it's no more being energized by the spirit wells of water bubbling up an everlasting life they've lost that zeal something's missing God remains the same Christ remains the same but his church has disassociated itself with his connection divine the spirit I'm just telling you what the Prophet said in 1958 all right let's go to the next one I mean that burning up watch this I mean that burning zeal of God nothing can stop it all right so the burning zeal of God nothing can stop it except you in your own self look at Hebrews 11 where there's just one nod of those Patriots from God they subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness stopped the lion's mouth and escaped fire the things they've done through faith by just one nod from God and let me let me interpolate that was without the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their song that was an anointing of the Holy Ghost all the people not an inward dwelling what will we do with an inward dwelling today God can send a preacher and Hammer that word as hard as he can and we go to sleep like some of you are now get up and walk out no wonder we're walled in the church is hmm I know this is tape it goes to a lot of places same here this goes all over the world because we have a tape sale completely around the world goes to missionary to foreign field and I mean everyone yes don't return this is to time to return while the calls coming this is our call brothers and sisters and ain't coming through me it's coming in the Word of God it's coming by the ignorance of preaching the message yes sir these signs shall follow sons not slaves I like that's why I put it in there these signs shall follow up sons not slaves our problem is we thought we were sons and daughters of God for all these years and we found out we're slaves so get born again and be a son and daughter of God not bondsman not servants why you gonna be a servant to sin but sons everybody all right burning zeal of God nothing can stop it amen all right now these those those of you that have quotes don't have these two I picked these up watch what brother Bram said now this is this is the wisdom of a prophet once there's 1956 what is the vision Oh God all flesh is like grass the ends clothes oh Christ of God received these poor people into the kingdom someday I must stand yonder at the throne of God and give an account for my ministry I wonder what people think about that when they start talking about brother branham's wrong and this is it just is it just mayor's well I'm telling you it's a trap of the devil it's a trap of the devil because brother Brown is preaching they we've we've taped eleven hundred and something sermons why would God go to all that trouble if we didn't need it come on people this message is sacred this message is pure the people have made it of none effect jesus stood up one day and said you've got the Word of God but you by your tradition you've made it him none effect to the people I say today that's what's happening in the ministry they have made it up not a fact brother Brad said has always been preachers he's never had problem with ladies always that problem with preachers I like what brother Clarke told me about brother Jeff's brother Jeff said when he'd find a minister that was a little bit off or he wanted to talk to him about his doctrine he'd take him to a steak house and wait till the brothers started putting steak in his mouth he wait till that brother puts the big piece of steak in his mouth and then he'd go at him God the brothers gone that's wisdom give account for these things that you're permitted me to do Lord he's got to give an account for what you and I are sitting here listening to in the midst of the people to declare the resurrection of the Lord Jesus God I must answer for that Oh God look burnsy Oh down into my heart more and more and wisdom that I might know how to lead the people to the Lord Jesus he wanted zeal but he wanted wisdom but watch this next quote and we'll stop right here number 16 musicians get ready to come watch I remember the last time hear from Raymond rich you caught me by the trousers leg as we were coming to church here in Los Angeles no I beg your pardon Long Beach we were going to the auditorium they like not Raymond's a personal friend of mine he had a breakdown he's in a terrible condition he said brother Brown don't go too long he just came back from Korea Raymond's getting a little far up the road too you know he said you'll kill yourself and said look what a condition and I've been along these lines yeah that got it got all the way down to the quote yet but anyway it looks like you got haven't got time look they've cut the quote off the rest of the quote says and it makes you nervous so I just hope the Lord forgives me that my zeal will never overcome my wisdom that my zeal will never overcome my wisdom because you can have so much zeal to you hurt people or you have so much zeal to where you just run right over people instead of having wisdom he'd give me wisdom to know how to handle my zeal rather they didn't have that somehow that got cut off for the quote but the quote says Lord forgive me that my zeal were not overcome my wisdom that's what I'm telling you a word revival it's not you all getting up jumping shouting praising God I'd love that that would be fine if we all get together and bind together like on the day of Pentecost I'll guarantee you that's what will happen cuz that's why it happened then but it's that we have a zeal I want us to have more zeal for God but don't let it override our wisdom to say hey we got to get the word first this is a word revival so if we get the word first then let's take the zeal and let's push that thing we got to push this thing to the coming of the Lord musicians come we got to push you and I I must fight that's okay we're getting ready to close don't worry Peter Cartwright I must fight if I should rain increase my faith Lord he pounded the tar out of that man let's pound the tar out of the devil on the way down to the baptismal service if you could see in another dimension you see angels standing lining the highway right standing at attention because what does the Bible saying the whole heaven rejoices all the Angels rejoice when one soul one soul we got three one soul comes home so they stand in their detention and they're gonna watch us go down and you know what the devil may be there but you know what he's doing what's happening over there out the angel turns around and says none of your business cuz it ain't none of his business he has no business being there we got less than the devil's real but God's more real the devil's real he's a real person but God by his word has give you power to overcome the devil let's stand to our feet give you a seal you say brother Wayne what are you talking about praise God five minutes more you did last week decide that you're going to read a little more than you did decide that you're gonna let God rule your life a little bit more than you did last week then you won't be such a zealot you'll have wisdom and guard to be able to use that wisdom and then you can move forward with God have a zeal that's what brother Brown said that's why I read that the church is lacking because they've lost the zeal they've lost the fervor how many of you brothers that had been married and you know I went to the Philippines for about three weeks and June and I've you know be we've made 40 years this year but last year I went to the Philippines for a couple of weeks and I had a fervor to get back home I wanted to see my bride I didn't care if it was 40 years or four minutes I wanted to get back home why I had missed her sure I'd been able to talk to her but God wants to see us face-to-face there's a barrier there they're stopping him and it's called us because we're gonna see him one day face to face our great bridegroom and he wants to see he has a fervor to see me in you now what me and you need to have is a fervor to see him as much as he wants to see us cuz you know what His Word says he can't come here unless he comes in youth he can't come unless he comes in you me and you so this is it we've come to the place the revival has begun just make sure you don't get left behind let's sing a song god bless you page 315 oh if you're in the [Music] if you with my brother surely you must be right keep on the fire [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
