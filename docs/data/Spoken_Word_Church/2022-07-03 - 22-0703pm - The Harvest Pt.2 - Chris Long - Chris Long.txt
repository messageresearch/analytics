love as we sing holy [Music] he's made us holy [Music] i like it you want to make a grown man cry like me you just sing like them ladies saying he's an on-time god and i think we'll call that the subtitle of our message on harvest that's right he's an on-time god let me tell you something folks the harvest is going to happen exactly when and where and how and with who that he ordained it to be and i just happen to believe we're part of that crop i surely do yeah god is good all the time amen amen amen while you're standing we'll just get right into it if you would i want you to turn to revelations chapter three of course i realize in the day and the hour we live in i think i said this before and a brother found it for me they i want an app that makes the sound of the pages of the bible turning because folks don't turn the pages of the bible no more they just look at the screen and that's not to make anybody feel bad that's just the hour we live in i'll tell you what let this word be engraved in your hearts and that's the bible we're looking for revelations chapter three i'm gonna start with uh let's see over here verse 7 and when you got it say amen unto the angel of the church in philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open door that's why i had you stop at the door right there and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name wow praise the lord behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews and are not but do lie behold i will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee because thou has kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth behold i come quickly hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god in the name of the city of my god which is the new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's pray father lord once again the reading of your word lord is sufficient father for the ears that would hear lord but the heart that yearns and cries out father for the deeper meaning lord and the intimate relationship with the author of this word father that's our desire tonight father we ask that you'd come down and come out yes and speak to us lord that's our desire for your honor and glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you baby seated now the reason that i read that is as the lord again dealing with me on these things um it seems like a strange scripture for me to read because we are in fact in the laodicean church age but in in in in looking over the word of the hour we find out that the prophet of god mentions quite often this open door he makes he makes it plain he makes it clear that it was set there for a purpose now we know that a door uh it can be described or used in many different ways and uh it it it's um it's it's a thing that that um as as we have explained before it a door can be shut but it can also be open while it's shut right by definition if you unlock a door even though it looks as if it is blocking the way of the passage because it's unlocked it's open amen it may look close to the natural eye but it's open to those who know something that no one else knows they see the door it looks like it's shut well in fact this door in revelations the philadelphian church age to many is still shut the bible says it's an open door for us that means it's unlocked it still could be could be used to block the passage for those who do not know that it's unlocked but for those that know it's unlocked they walk right up through it turn the knob and they go right amen through it so now we have another side to the open door now the reason i read it out of out of the philadelphian or the sixth church age is because the prophet of god taught something and i remember uh many years ago i've been around and acquainted with the message for 43 years and and and and when i first got saved and and the lord brought me uh right to the message um i i remember there was there were you know and i'll use the word controversial but maybe they were just doctrines and things that men were pondering and and wondering about and conversing with and discussing you know how it is um and some of them were arguing yes and some of them were disputing yes but some of them were trying to come to a revelation now remember he's an on-time god and the prophet of god even makes it clear to us that if it wasn't time for those things to be revealed they would remain a mystery right now we know that the seventh church age messenger according to the scriptures the seventh angel was sent for a purpose and that purpose was to be used by god to unlock or open the mysteries that had been kept back and hidden throughout the ages before he used it he used a term like this tie up the loose ends he said that was the responsibility and the ministry of the seventh angel now in spoken word is the original seed and i know i've read it here brother branham also says he believed that his mission the reason that he was here now we realized that there were many reasons given but now in spoken word as the original seed he's going to begin to speak words that only the original seed are going to make a connection with so he said my mission i believe to the world is to forerun the coming word wait a minute i thought the word was already here what else is there to come whether you realize it or not i'm looking at that coming word that would be you and me in the mind of god before the foundation of the world i believe each one of us represented something that god was going to write down one day and then he was going to let the words on the paper come to life as it says in john 1 1 and the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god so we know that the word and god are one but he wasn't finished he's an on-time god what he wanted to do was express himself through material tangible attributes because god is a spirit no man has seen god at any time but god wanted to be seen amen so he he set in motion a plan where that invisible god could come down he had to come down he couldn't go up because he was the highest thing there was so he had to condemn sin down and the way that he he he he set this up was he knew because he had no beginning very very difficult for you and i to understand come on think about i mean i don't care how intelligent you are and whether you're a capify and you're uh and you're a 4.2 and and whatever you are yeah a doctor a phd degree is all over the wall that's okay i'm i'm good with that how are you going to understand a being that had no beginning and will have no end how you going to do it the only way you're going to do it is to have been part of that being that's the only way there ain't no other way amen oh i feel good we realized that god's plan required god to be just yes that's right fair everybody's gets a chance but he knew that there would be because of the fall a great number of people manifest on the earth through that fall that were not in his mind before the foundation of the world i like to to to classify them as collateral benefactors just the fact that they were given an opportunity for life and choice would make them a collateral benefactor now the choice was theirs to make and imagine okay in a way in a way you and i didn't have a choice in a way i want you to understand that now in order for him to be a just god he had to put everybody on the same playing field amen so we do have a choice but what we are beginning to realize is that the choices that we make today were based on where we came from all right that's right in the mind of god before the foundation of the world he said let me get my book out [Music] because all of my attributes are going to make the right choice i don't care what condition they're in i don't care what they have to go through if they're my attributes they're going to make a right choice and he said scribe get that pin yeah dip it in that blot of blood right there and you begin to write names on that book because their names are going to manifest themselves those my attributes them my children and at the end of their life at least by then they will make the right choice now some of us had to go through hell and high water to make that choice others of us started when we were fresh and clean and young and praise the lord you ain't wearing all the scars somebody like i got right brother they're not tattoos now they're scars big difference thanks be to god amen [Music] you wear a scar long enough and it starts to fade you know it starts to blend in after a while it just becomes a part of you yeah and if you get old like me you'll say i wonder i i know i got that little spot right there but don't quite remember how i got that then you make a story up you embellish on it you know now i kind of remember something but uh but okay so here it is yeah yeah god knows god god knows we're scarred that's right amen so in order for him to come across as just a responsible god which he is affair because i know a lot of people say well that ain't fair yeah well get your dictionary out yeah he spoke in parables yes you did amen i was referring earlier to you today matthew 13 it starts out parables and of course the disciples are wondering why you're you know what are you doing talking in parables well i'm talking in perils because there are those that i'm going to just cut it to the chase they weren't meant to be nope right but but and they got and i want to be fair to them so so i want them to make a choice based on something they don't understand right yeah think about it they don't understand what he's saying so then they begin to you know look into it and study it and see but to those who were his children it's not a parable it has a meaning the word parable means a short allegorical story designed to illustrate or teach some truth religious principle or moral lesson it also means a statement or comment that conveys a meaning indirectly by the use of comparison analogy or the like yeah paul uses the word allegory or allegory depending on how you want to pronounce it galatians 4. allegory a representation of an abstract oh i like that already or spiritual meaning through listen now concrete or material forms of course i'm thinking of cement that's not the word figurative treatment of one subject under the guise which like a disguise of another amen okay this is an allegory a symbolical narrative from a greek word alegria to speak so as to imply something else now do you all remember me coming here and preaching on revelations the book of symbols so to you and i the word parable and the word allegory are words that are are are from the middle english language they were used because king james court and his translators found what they thought was the best word to represent in english the greek or the latin so in today's world we would use the word metaphor they've tried to turn it into a metaverse but it's a metaphor a figure of speech in which a term or phrase is applied to something to which it is not literally applicable in order to suggest a resemblance what's the dictionary brother wade i didn't put this down the dictionary said it said as in a mighty fortress is our god when i saw that in the dictionary i said where'd this dictionary come from now god himself the spirit is not a mighty fortress but a mighty fortress is our god it's a metaphor for our god amen you got that yes sir you're probably wondering where is he going with this oh i'm going right to the tent i'm going right to the door but just hang on is the door open or closed the question is the bible says it's an open door then you have to ask yourself whether it's a jar that means open like that right or just unlocked yeah all right come on he's the just god brother amen it's an open door amen for you and me it's unlocked it doesn't have to be literally open passageway why because jesus didn't consider it when he walked into the upper room where the fellas was all crying over the crucifixion he just come right through the wall yeah that's right what's up what's up boys what you know and doubting thomas all right listen to this metaphor something used or regarded as being used to represent something else it said emblem or symbol from latin and greek metaphoric to transfer whoa i saw that i said praise the lord i like that one already but the reason that i read these to you is so that you could understand now okay watch this now so when king david said in the psalms my bones they stare at me was he talking of himself or another come on yeah so when the prophet of god said i'll ride this trail again was he talking of himself or another well it would take the holy spirit through the revelation of god the author of that word to clearly bring the picture into development is that right now i'm just using that as a metaphor it's a parable yeah well when i began to look into the definition of harvest based upon the third part of it and remember god works in threes fives sevens eight ten twelve right you understand amen but three is what we're interested in because it's perfection five is what we spend most of our time on because it's grace it's mercy it's faith you understand all that but god himself implemented a plan where he was perfected in three amen so again we have the three stages of the journey stalk tossing shuck now the grain that is coming forth is not the fourth stage of the journey it's the result of the first three because the number four is the number of earth it's man's number we're interested in god as we know because of the harvest the stock tossal and shuck represent the three stages of justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and you must have all three those three stages must be working in your life at all times in order for you to become the producer the carrier of the life so to speak of the grain but i learned something brother branham preached a message called three kinds of believers and he broke it down and he said there's three kinds of believers in every church and as soon as you hear that you start going yeah i don't know about them yeah about them up there i'm the only believer in the place but i want you to understand the three kinds of believers was referring to the church well i'm speaking to the bride i'm speaking to the grain did you realize that the grain itself the wheat the corn of wheat also has three stages oh yeah i talk i i was taught this on a documentary about wheat think about where we're at amen three kinds of believers in every church now let's let's elevate again let's go to the grain elevator and let's get to the grain the wheat grain or kernel is broken down into three parts the bran or the outer shell which is high in fiber it'll scratch it the next is called the endosperm or the pulp it's full of starch it's the part of the wheat grain that's not very healthy bran has bran has some properties in it that will help you the endosperm which makes up 83 of the grain is the part of the grain that science has figured out how to manipulate now now i want you to say well that oh a biology lesson oh it's a lesson on church we understand we understand the lutherans and the wesleyans and the pentecost but do we understand ourselves do we understand what part of the process of god that we are amen but blessed be the name of the lord the colonel also has something called the germ now you run that word through your message concordance and find out where you're at it's the germ of life that makes the difference amen now science and biologists cannot manipulate the wheat plant without the germ but what they've done is they've manipulated the other two parts of the plant so the germ can't reproduce itself you're with me amen right oh i'm getting to it the brand makes up 14 and a half percent the germ makes up 2.5 of the entire kernel i want you to think about it now the brand is rough now brother brandon preached three kinds of believers in every church he said that the unbeliever sets around now watch the way we think because i i i'm just like you uh so the unbeliever is going to walk in the back door they're going to hear something they don't like and they're going to leave it could be 40 years before they hear something they don't like and leave i've seen it and leave the word of god for their own denominational differences but that's just a little old tiny 14 and a half percent it's this 83 that's the danger that's the make believer and brother brown said that's the guy you gotta watch now brothers and sisters don't be looking over your shoulders because i'm here to tell you that each one of us are represented as this colonel and this guy right here you're looking at preaching to you is three kinds of believers oh yeah this thing out here is unbelief to the max right it don't like anything that's said yep right the guy there on the inside the spirit he'll contend and he'll reason and he'll but the guy down in the control room you know that 2.5 percent has to tell this 84 shut up keep to yourself that bread you're making ain't no good for nobody yeah see because that's where they get the bread that's not any good you've heard of wheat you've heard of bran wheat bran the endosperm the pope they can manipulate it into anything and it's just full of starch and guess what it's doing it's killing us [Music] catch it so there's a spiritual man on the inside of you that wants you to die but if god's spirit is down on the inside there's two and a half percent of you that can control that can create amen that can destroy that can speak that can be silent and get more done than all the rest of the colony i said all that so that you'd understand god's perfected in thrace amen because what we're going to enter into here in a few minutes is what you and i have been told is called the third pull three now see because somebody's who the third pole no no no no no we don't we don't do that here well then you don't fish see it's that simple these terms are given to us so that we can come to an understanding of what god expects of us but they're in parables amen all right they're allegories they're metaphors why to hide the true intent from those who it was not meant for that's right amen so brothers and sisters you say well i don't know brother chris i mean you know i i haven't been able to figure that out don't try to figure it out i can't figure this out i'm going to read to you in a minute where don't try to explain this well what are you doing up there preaching oh i'm not trying to explain it it's impossible to explain yeah right it's not a public show right but that doesn't mean you catch out that's right it's something going on on the inside you know that two and a half percent of that little colonel there it's doing some shouting amen should be because that's me when you realize who you are you ain't going to be quiet it's like that fellow that told brother brandon why i really liked your message brother brown tell that lady over there start shouting think about it he's trying to tell us something he's not trying to tell us to be outward emotional and in the flesh and pentecostal by denomination he's telling us there's a life on the inside and when that life begins to move and it begins to see what it is and where it came from who it is and where it's going it's going to do a little bit of shouting amen now i can tell by looking at you some of you have never shouted in your life but we'll shout for the music or we'll shout for the baseball football game we'll shout for this we'll shout for that we'll shout if we catch a big fish we really shout if we don't catch no fish you understand but if something's moving on the inside you can't help it but go oh at least a little whoa oh that's me because there's life in it that's the reason why there's life in it amen right i just love god's word amen it's the best so let me move forward a little bit i'm going to finish the paragraph i started with you earlier i know what's in here i got this far oh she'll be a little bitty group jesus said it's uh harvest time page 44 in this edition here watch i'm just going to read a couple more sentences oh she'll be such a little bitty group see that's that little tiny germ that's in that entire kernel because that's the stage of the journey we're at it doesn't mean the other folks aren't saved no all right brother come on that's right come on you got it there's there's millions going to be saved but the bride see the little meaty group think about the size of the plant and that little bitty seed it should be such a little bitty group jesus said it was as it was in the days of noah wherein eight souls was saved is that right so shall it be in the coming of the son of man it didn't say revealing it said coming of the son of man how many i don't know but see the bride see i was taking it now the church has already got their reward and it is salvation and a lot of people would stop right there and go that's all i need fine we shouldn't be down on them or against that praise the lord that there's salvation for the multitude but the bride she's made up so much differently you know that fourteen and a half percent and 83 they got to go along with the two and a half percent that germ that life in there is crying out for some what's he crying for what in the world if you were the colonel yeah if you were the corn of wheat what would you need to cry out for to bring forth after your kind and his kind was life not death right that's where we're at amen it's life calling for life it's not life calling for death and then life that happened two thousand years ago i can read to you somewhere in here where brother branham says jesus went into the grave and when he rose that was perfection amen right yeah because he only needed to raise one time to prove you cannot kill that life that life cannot die but here we are 2 000 years later brother branham preaches the message i indict this generation for the second crucifixion you can't crucify jesus christ two times but what they didn't realize is they were crucifying the word that he is not him in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and they crucified the word made flesh so what satan decided that he would do in the hour we live in is begin to hybrid god's word to mix it to to bring it to a place where it could not reproduce itself and bring forth life i got news for you devil you cannot kill that life that life is here and now and it exists in the hearts of god's children and you cannot kill it that's why they're waiting on us it's beautiful as as it is beyond the curtain of time where the prophet went and they didn't sweat and they didn't work and they didn't have to go to the mailbox and get the bills out and they had to go to work they didn't have to get their own straw that's right hey what's happening hey it was free the temperature was perfect they didn't get hungry didn't get thirsty did you know there was still something wrong with that picture absolutely yes sir yes sir that was not the complete plan of god amen the process of the plan of god do you know that everybody that goes before you and me is waiting for you and me amen they listen now they can't be made perfect what why sounds like a perfect place to meet they're not eating nope all right all right they're not drinking they're not walking down here on their inheritance you see they're waiting for something hey that's right amen and i believe we got the devil's answer right here i believe with all my heart listen careful now how many i don't know he says but see the bible the bride is going to be made up of all down through then he's pauses and he says that had the word in their age it's not just this last group god is going to take the whole thing out of here oh no it'll be so small he says it'll be surprising they'll come up missing and you won't even know they're gone what if you know but by the way see i get launched off on that did you realize you're looking at me preaching to you and i want you to know i'm missing and you don't even know it right see because the man on the inside is being raptured he's being caught up into heavenly places in christ jesus i mean he's really sitting beyond the curtain of time but he realizes that's not enough all right said you ain't living without something dying that's right well brother branham the seven-day adventist kind of shot out at him and said i'm i was surprised to hear you eat eggs and meat what's wrong with that brother he said well you're killing substance he said so are you the air you breathe the lettuce you eat the enzymes the germs see people see how they are they think in terms of yeah denominational differences right right that's not the way we're to think we're to look at god's word and we're to say this is god's plan now where do i fit that's right amen and king david had a revelation he said let me be the gate keeper let me be the gatekeeper and in the day we live in the prophet came and said let me be the door matt you catch that let me be the door matt amen you know why he said that because david was going to be the gatekeeper yeah because he asked for it listen they'll come up missing you won't even know they're gone what if he took 500 in this last days think about it think about the day we live in there's they're snatching up children left or night by the tens of the thousands and they go missing they're selling them and using them and abusing them and so forth all the time now you might know somebody personally that happened too but the world who's jane doe it's not just this last group god is going to take the whole thing out of here they'll come up missing you would never know it took 500 in a few days time two or three days there's that many people comes up missing across the world and they don't even know where they're at never hear nothing about them he then he stops and he says the secret coming of the lord jesus she'll be taken away amen do you realize the reason it's a secret is because nobody would know anything about it and i'm telling you this because it's happening in you and me you say well we're waiting on the coming of the lord he's been here 2000 years yeah as charles johnson would say yeah [Laughter] he's been here 2000 years he has he's been here that's how the prophet was given the ability to be able to produce the results it it wasn't william mariam branham he even says it on his own words and recordings he said it's jesus christ so then of course people go hmm yeah oh he's jesus christ no he didn't say that he wouldn't allow that you and i wouldn't allow that but he would allow for you to call him the bride because she is part of him is that right she's mrs jesus look at the day and age we live in i won't preach on it but it's chaos if people don't realize we're in chaos they may never realize it okay so in revelations 3 as we read about the philadelphian church age the prophet of god taught something i'm going to go back to where i was at this controversy that i'd heard 40 some years ago they said well the prophet always comes at the end of the age have you heard that yes sir but if you read everything he said he said it's the previous h so that's why he was born in 1909 if you want dates pentecost started in 1906 it began to dominate in 1914 1516 right in there but god set now watch now you see you got to be careful god set an open door now that open door was not william mary and branham it was the jesus christ that was using william mary and branham he's the door to the sheepfold because he's the good shepherd you're with me but you need to say well thanks how you getting to the tent vision on this it's a series of events and because of the definition of harvest time this series of events begins to separate to cut to shear according to the definition now you and i aren't doing the separating but we can be involved in what causes the separation we can either go on that side or that side but you're not going to be able to remain in the center because it's not the definition of harvest it's separating it's taking one thing from another and one thing from another and do you know where you and i come in you die out to yourself you want to separate separate from your old life separate from your thoughts separate from your dying body there's a man on the inside you know the old song there's a man in here who turns water to wine do you see him but he's in here amen he walks on the water gives sight to the blind gives back life to the ones that's dead he fed 4 000. with seven loaves of bread he's here but you've got to come to the realization that that is what is going on in your life and brother and sister if you can't see that far yet you get there and it's all up to you it's not up to the pastor it's not up to the teaching or the preaching or the tapes or the prophet it's up to you he's a just god he's a fair god and he said you make the choice that's why we're on free moral agency brother branham would say it like this he didn't say wade you're not going and brother you're going he said you two got a choice you want to go or not right but because of foreknowledge which is based on his knowledge of himself he knew who would and would not because he knew who was in him or who was not now you say well well i don't know about me brother you're making the choice that's right you want to be in him [Music] [Applause] i was in him and then of course there's this little black guy in the black hand hey hey hey hey little guy over here going hey hey hey thank you think about it bro he's no you're not the one remember what you did yesterday remember that thought you got you know last night while you were praying there's a guy over here says shut up you got to get there amen that's where we're at it's harvest time and harvest time is a separation and what's being separated in us is god's word and our reason and our reason is not going to shut up even if we tell it to well what we got to do is we be god again to starve it to death because it doesn't have life after death once it dies now watch this now i'm going to get serious with you it doesn't have life after death no you agree amen once the hybrid seed dies it's finished but guess what the children of god have a resurrection power in them and they have the ability to raise that stinking life up cause that's what's gonna happen at the judgment every stinking life that went down is gonna have to be raised up and set at the white throne judgment amen so let's not let it race back let's leave it in the grave amen how by the words of life let them prevail let them be your driving force let them be your yay and your amen amen yeah it's really see because people are like that's impossible so i can just say i'm saying come on now it's possible yeah that's what the disciples thought when a rich man couldn't go to heaven it's impossible yeah he said come on guys all things are possible amen with god and all things are possible to those who believe i am a believer i don't care what the rest of me says amen all right now i'm bringing the rest of me under control so that it can't have an argument on whether i'm a believer or not it's just gonna have to fall in line guess what it becomes a prisoner yeah a man a prisoner yeah that's why you can say be quiet i ain't feeding you today you have no chance you you've got a life sentence and you ain't getting out that's the old nature all right we've got to destroy that all right i'm going to turn the corner i'm gonna go over to the tent meeting now still with me i don't mean to wear you out you're good okay now how about you well i'd say well open your bibles but i know it doesn't always work so but i'm going to turn to a couple of scriptures that i gave the brothers i was going to read revelations uh uh 3 14 through 20 which is the laodicean age maybe i will you got your finger still there on late on on revelations 3. all right now now the sixth age is important because if you read the philadelphian church age the sixth church age which you and i because a lot of people think well i wasn't in the sixth church age oh don't tell me you're not passing through the stature of a perfect man and you have to get to the sixth stage of that stature and that sixth stage is represented right here you have to get to the stage where you see an open door because you kept his word you kept his name you kept everything you could keep that's your stepping stone to the seventh amen and guess what the number seven represents completion you get to the seventh stage of god's plan and you're almost there amen brother right so watch this under the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation oh we're back to the beginning he said and from the beginning it was not so i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou work cold or hot so then because they are lukewarm see that's somebody that's yeah yeah i can't make up my mind i say make your decision and go all the way brother okay i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich oh look at the day we live in don't you see it and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knoweth not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness did not appear and anoint thine eyes with thy salve that thou mayest see man the philadelphia church agents got it going on laodicean looks like a sick dog but you got to get from one to the other sure this this is the part i like how many believes god loves them amen say amen amen then i rebuke and jason oh no oh no he's a god of love he wouldn't dare spank me they're sending me to the corner you don't know the god then that's right that we serve because if he loves you he rebukes and chases you why because of the fall brothers and sisters because of the condition we're in because of the state of things all right because we're dying he loves us so there's a rebuke and a chastening and he says be zealous therefore and do what this is why god loved david amen david did lots of things wrong he had a guy killed he had a guide of people carrying the ark that was wrong in a cart that was wrong and when usaid died oh my goodness what did i do and he repented yes he did and that's why god said you're a man after my own heart i sure love you king david get up because i'm gonna raise up a throne yes yes and it's gonna be called the throne of david yes it is amen and look at the things david did wrong oh david had his mighty men in it but he made mistakes he's an example for you and me amen i'm not putting down my sword just cause david no fell on his face i'm not putting down my sword because i fell on mine absolutely i'm gonna get up and keep on fighting the good fight all right okay let's keep reading behold verse 20 i stand at the door and knock watch if any man hear my voice and open the door okay i'm gonna stop so the prophet of god gives us an indication of what's going on here he refers us to a painting remember is it here in the room got that painting on the wall here that's okay you guys all know that it was a painting done by a famous painter and the when the art critic came and said but it's a nice painting but you forgot something yeah right he said what are you talking about he said look there's no knob they called it a latch then there's no latch on the outside of the door oh i painted it that way really how come because you've got to open it from the inside amen and as we all know by code when you have a front door it opens in why so you don't knock everybody off the porch seriously a retired carpenter i should know that it opens in so if he's on the outside knocking and there's no knob or latch no keyhole he's expecting anybody home there's no doorbell he's knocking yeah and the prophet of god told us that he was knocking the most pathetic picture he said in the bible was jesus christ listen now he wasn't outside of the presbyterian church wasn't outside of the methodist church he wasn't outside the baptist church or the or the orthodox church or even the catholic church yep he was outside of his home okay right come on open up so i can come in yeah that's right with me i knew this was going to take a while brother wayden i didn't want it to take a long time okay so i'll cut to the chase a little bit okay so we have an open door which is a door that's unlocked between the sixth and the seventh h i'm going to tell you what it is it represents the message of the hour this is unlocked to whosoever will okay but in order for the door to be open i said it was unlocked but in order for the message of the hour to be opened now we're in the laodicean church age he's knocking on the door expecting you yes that's right amen open and let him in and once he gets in there we're told that you know if you're if you're real grumpy ah you can have a seat but if you're real friendly say you hungry yeah there's plenty in the fridge help yourself yep take your shoes off watch now wait a minute now so now they got into the living room in the kitchen oh but don't go down the hallway i haven't made the bed today yeah pillows aren't all fluffed up doesn't look good i know the ladies honey what are you doing all that i don't know nobody comes in our bedroom yeah i know what this is this pillow's all got to be right here gotta look good why in case he comes in yeah not literally get your mind out of the gutter i'm talking about the church now i'm talking about the bride but the prophet of god tells us that's where a connection is made you don't just let him in the living room after you open the door three kinds of believers body spirit and soul living room kitchen bedroom you're a three-room house is that right oh man i'm having a good time i'll tell you why because you don't realize it but things are just spinning around inside of me that but i'm gonna get to the door of the little room that's all i'm gonna get to okay now in order for me to uh make sure you understand i am not interpreting what we call the tent vision but i want you to also hear me that in my lifetime some of the things that brother branham says in the progression of the tent vision have happened in my life some of them happened in his the first part of it mexico city you say brother uh you're stretching it now i won't be stretching it if it happens to you because this is interpreted by it coming to pass that's the reason why people are disputing and and oh no it means this and it means that and then it means exactly what it says amen but it's a parable right it's an allegory it's a metaphor it stands for some that's why i wanted you to see oh my bones they stare at me david's bones weren't staring at him and literally jesus bones were not literally staring at him even though they were probably sticking out of his his rib cage you could see it she knew i'm saying he was referring to that valley of dry bones they were staring at him they were gawking at him while he was hanging on the cross you see david was speaking allegory in a metaphor that's what this is and if a prophet didn't interpret it then it has to come to pass in order for it to be understood right now you say well i don't see that coming to pass in my life oh you just knuckled down a little bit and you see this coming to pass in your life watch this and i'll give you this part and then i'll move on quickly so in this series of events brother branham talking about starting out he was in the room literally with his wife and his and his wife and him were talking and he was talking about being hung for fifteen thousand dollars that he had to pay back and he believed he needed to do it before he went back out on the field because he said if god sent me god would take care of it and he left a meeting in california and he was intending on telling his family all the way through all the states while they were driving back to indiana i'm going to tell him when we get to arizona i'm going to tell him when we get to the state line i'm going to tell him when we get here i'm going to tell him no no no no no was he embarrassed did he not know how to say what he wanted to say did he think it would hurt their feeling i don't know i don't know those things all i know is he waited until he got back home and then he began to tell them what happened and he was talking with his wife meda and as soon as he said something that triggered he started to go off into a vision now i'm sure he was standing there but he started to go off in a vision and i happen to know by reading enough of the message to know that sister media recognized and billy paul recognized immediately when the angel of the lord was coming near and they would begin to back away why because brother branham was being taken he was physically right there oh yeah but he himself was being taken as a prophet into a vision and he began to see just like you watched television he began to see this series of events or event whatever is taking place like when he's discerning people right did i say that he ever heard him say that anything is that true because he's saying what he sees he's not absolutely cognizant of those things okay so he's he's going into this vision and i'm i'm paraphrasing it so it'll accelerate and he gets to this spot where he's going to go fishing everybody in here probably knows this but i want to use this to get to the next point if it's okay and he and he talks about in the message being led of the holy spirit i have almost every one of what i'm here what is the vision these were all in 1956. now he does talk about this in the seals but this is right after he began to become involved in the recognition of what these things meant now at first he didn't know he didn't even know what the little brown children are purling the wagon right later on he recognized that that was the fulfillment of that part of this vision when he went and preached in mexico city and they got rained down they tried to take him here and take him there and all kinds of things happened okay now i'm gonna let me put this aside let me go to where he is fishing are you okay with that all right the angel of the lord tells him i'm going to teach you how to fish i want you to think about something now this is william branham a fisher of men and a really good fisherman at one time i i saw the fish and i was told that it was the world record rainbow trout that he caught and they taxidermy for him i said so so watch i'm saying all this because he's a fisherman but the angel lord says now i'm going to show you how to fish brother brown says i know how to fish yeah but watch he says uh hang on bear with me i showed up at a lake i walked on i passed the ministers and then i walked a little further and i came into a great panoramic affair then i went further into the vision so you can go back and read all these things i'm skipping forward and when i did i was standing with a well you know a little baby shoe you've all heard this in one place he calls it a moccasin right okay and and i'm and i got this this shoe's got little bitty eyelets it's not a booty it's a shoe and i had a string in my hand and i was trying to lace this little eighth of an inch hole in this eyelet you know how small a little eyelet is in a baby shoe and i and i had a string in my hand and i was trying to lace this little eighth of an inch hole in this eyelet with about a half inch string about size my pinky it ain't gonna work okay just working fervently trying to push that string through now remember brothers and sisters i'm telling you all this because this is a metaphor it's a parable it's an allegory he doesn't he's seeing it he's explaining what he sees but it represents something else what it represents is him trying to force that little that big string through that little hole the angel says you cannot teach pentecostal babies supernatural things now he didn't say he couldn't teach the pentecostals he said pentecostal babies they needed to grow up they needed to get bigger eyelets in their shoes that string needed to get smaller which if you follow it along it does watch now he said he said uh and i i heard something whipping around whoa okay you're using the wrong end of the string the angel told him brothers i'm going back between three messages so you try to keep up with me and i recognize that voice you can't teach baby supernatural things you're using the wrong end of the string and i look down at the end of the string lying on the floor a great big pile of string and it was laced down to a nice eighth of an inch so the other end of the pile of string was the right size to go in this shoe it was laced down to a nice save in an inch so it would go through the hole and i said i understand and as i reached to pick up the string see so he he came to an understanding of what it meant he began to pick up the string and he was taken again that's over now you mark this down he says watch it come to pass as i started to reach down i was gone again then when i come to i was standing by the side of a beautiful lake something like your lake here who's preaching in chicago in the summertime when it's pretty and green and there were fishermen all around the lake and they were fishing but they were catching small fishes and i looked out into the lake and those great big beautiful rainbow trout out there now remember he caught the world record rainbow trout but in this vision he seized these great beautiful rainbow trout and he said i know this is efficient he says it but i can't understand those trout yeah come on all right amen he's not here nope right of course he can't understand those trout because the revelation is progressive and it keeps moving it doesn't stop and he got to a point where god took him home right amen sorry brother you'll read all the stories he said about it you will never find one place where he caught one of those rainbow trout and he's a fisherman and the angel of the lord told him how to catch him but where did he go wrong does anybody remember he tried to explain it all right ma'am yeah that's why i'm not trying to explain this to you no matter what you think there you go because i can't it's revealed by revelation it's just like the seventh seal you can't explain the seventh seal to anybody why because it's silent amen is that right can i ask you a question i know you're all thinking well some of you are sleeping but i know you're all thinking but i don't hear a thing so when the seventh seal was open it was silent because it represented something that was silent right brother branham said you know all the noise that's made out there try to hear the earth turning at 20 something where whatever miles per hour it's spinning around some of you students probably know sure you can't hear a thing and this thing's moving if it wasn't for gravity we'd be flung off of it but you can't hear it there's something else that you cannot hear the mind of god but it's represented yes it is in the manifestation of its immense amen you're with me that's where you and i come in that's why this is all becoming so real to me you might think well you're crazy okay you know yeah i've been called worse that's right listen so now i'm gonna get around i did the rainbow trout thing you can read all that there's so much in it all right now he gets to the tent and the other progressive dimension in this vision he says and oh all the people they they they look like they went around the tent and out of city blocker more a great line of people and they were all standing around there with their prayer card and i just then i seen a woman in an ambulance stretcher was laying and man behind her was standing on crutches so they were standing there waiting for their turn there was a lady taking down their names that never happened at one of running pants campaigns and then there was a canvas stretched here that no one could get around that tent you ain't getting in no other way you're coming through the door or you ain't coming at all i want you to watch this and listen how it is now you watched the difference then i heard that whipping like that always every time we have a healing service that's just what happens that's the way it always sounded it sounded that way in the bush that time when i heard it moses heard the same thing see and i looked and here went that real soft light moving away from me and went down and went into that little building we went from a tent to a little building do you know that brother branham used the first five verses of psalms 27 for the message the rapture and when he got to the fifth verse he talks about the fifth verse in psalms is pavilions and tabernacle yeah yeah sure so brother wade i i got my little strong's concordance out there and i said i'm gonna see what the definition is of pavilion i know what a tabernacle is a tabernacle is a stretched skin yeah amen are you a tabernacle yes oh i'm a tabernacle you're a tabernacle whether you like it or not you're also a tent right amen what is a tent it's a mobile shelter without a permanent foundation held down by stakes and lines that's what the dictionary says do you know who else was a tent yeah abraham he was wandering around looking for a city whose builder and maker was not man and he'd move his tent from place to place and people would say abraham you're out of your mind you say god's talking to you you left a listen now a good job he was in the tech industry he made idols and he came from a super wealthy family in a super wealthy place okay god talked to you you kind of wonder in the day we live in what milkshake he was drinking think about it i mean because that's the way people would when i got saved they thought i oh deed yeah amen i'm gonna find something for od that works better than od but it was the lord right call me right off the street amen who's that what is going on inside of me how come i'm not happy how come i'm not content how come this how come that how come this pick up your cross and follow me do i have to carry the cross pick up your cross and follow me amen you know the song the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb oh no yeah [Laughter] i like it yeah all right i'll come to an end because i know this is long and watch now that little building he says now i'm in another and there's there's something different between the light and the angel because he was still here with me and the light had went into the building and this angel still speaking behind me which is a big man said i will meet you in there so then i said i don't understand why in there this is the prophet yep right he said watch and this woman went and she come out of there uh uh on the ambulance stretcher she was pushing the stretcher out the other side so she went in on a stretcher and down the street she went right okay and the lady and she said the lady asked her what happened she said i don't know you getting this i don't know what do you mean you don't know you went in the room on a stretcher and you're pushing this treasure out the other side what do you mean you don't know what happened this is that third pull amen yes see that's what he says he's saying it all along in different places and nobody will know nothing about it but brothers and sisters the reason for that is the devil can't get it no it's happening in you and me and we're like huh yeah right man i mean i don't get it but my question to you is is it happening of course we don't get it we can't explain it but something on the inside is working on the outside oh what a change he has rocked this is going to change our mortal bodies not my ministry not what i'm preaching but what the revelation of his word is and you've got to want to stay with it even don't worry whether you understand it or not they had no idea who was talking to abraham abraham you're nuts sarah his church well i'm married and he's my lord so okay i don't understand i had air conditioning a washer and a dryer a refrigerator i had all this stuff and you're dragging me around do you know why character yeah we need a little character and when you need some character he's gonna drag you around tell you get up and go okay i got that i'm good okay now listen now i'll get to the end of it i know somebody's laughing yeah right what happened she said i've been in this stretcher said i've been down in bed for years and here come the man out packing his crutches see because another guy went in after if you read the other parts and they asked him what he said he didn't know he was coming to the platform to testify oh he was coming to the platform to testify and somehow he ends up on one side of this little room and goes through and comes out the other side says i have no clue that's happening right now whether you realize or not because i know people go high and got no clue what this man is talking about i don't have to have one either that's the beauty of the whole thing stay with the word amen because this is god's word and there ain't none of us all put together gonna comprehend god right amen but if we remain obedient and chaste and subjected to god's word eventually it's going to become the wheel in the middle of the wheel you think what i'm telling you is crazy i challenge you to read ezekiel chapter one it goes from one dimension to another from one vision to another from one metaphor and parable and allegory to another watch this sorry i'm preaching too much you're good no and i don't now watch what the prophet says he was coming to the platform to testify and brother branham says to the angel i don't understand that in there yeah you know why because that part of the pyramid wasn't written on he interpreted the outside of the pyramid and when he drove that crowbar that sharp object in the top of that rock that cap rock and popped it off what did he tell the people look on this and you can imagine if there was no writing in their cis and you looked in there and yeah what exactly right he said most of the people did not do what he told them to do here's what i believe you stand and look down in there long enough by obedience and there will come writing amen yes there will come words there will come recognition there will come revelation out there and you go whoa man i never saw that before right you know why you never saw it before because you never looked long enough right all right all right you gotta stay with it brothers and sisters you can't let it you know it's got to become your driving force in your life no you don't have to become a religious nut that's right you just have to become obedient because obedience is better than sacrifice sacrifice and offerings thou what is not but a body amen hostile prepared me you're that you're part of it i believe that yeah i don't understand that in there and watch he's always scriptural see brother branham now the angel is taking him back to the scripture he said do did not our lord say when thou prayest be not like the hypocrites that like to make a show that wouldn't have been the third pool because it's not a public show he said enter into the secret closet and when you've done so close the hey door hey hang on i'm stopping oh i'm stopping but wait until i get to the part i'm stopping at this got me you all think that you know like oh man gee wow this just comes to me i mean i was traveling over here and i was looking for something else and i said oh i see the door and the vision you can read the other versions i just wanted to read you the one that got them all here we could take hours we don't need to go back and look for yourself but watch what he says in revelations chapter 4 part 3. and these cherubims oh hold it you well you i'm going to genesis brothers i'll tell you it gets hot you want to get into the tin fission you go to exodus where it talks about the tent of meeting it didn't say tent meeting it's a tent of meeting the tent of the meeting yeah okay i'm gonna take you to genesis because i ain't got time for that one i'll get that when i get home listen now genesis 3 starting at 22 and the lord god said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life oh i'm having a good time door any means of approach admittance or access any gateway marking an entrance or exit from one place or condition to another listen careful comes from a greek from a from an old english word dor meaning gate wait a minute it doesn't say gate in in in genesis uh 3 down here in verse 24 the prophet said gate but watch this it says and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life who is the door who is the truth who is the life who is the way that's right amen wait a minute the word gate it means a breach or a hole wait a minute i i was having a ball you can imagine the word way and you say no way i say way my wife knows amen oh away it's a passage or channel from the origins for the word road thoroughfare or highway it's a passage that's right you want to go where god wants us to go then you've got to meet the challenge and these cherubims first mentioned was placed at the east gate of the garden going four ways i should have made that a little different from that brother brandon referring to a drawing from a little different than that i can't do justified to god's orders and things like that but so that you'll know what i mean there's the garden of eden he's referring to a drawing and this is the gate right here you're with me cause i'm closing right there's an open door we found out that it's just unlocked then he's knocking on the door to your heart and you have to open it and it opens this way is that right watch what you have to do now watch the door on the ten vision you shut that door in the tent vision listen careful man there's the garden of eden and this is the gate right here it opens up here it swings out it swings out you know how when a gate swings out you got to pull on it and then you got to walk through it and you got to turn click and latch it so the neighbor's dogs don't get in and your cats don't get out that's what's going on amen that gate that was placed in the garden of eden is now freely entered by those who have invited him in by opening the door inward and traveling with him through their three-room house till you get to the gate now that gate doesn't open inward it swings out there's a reason for it because he wants you to open that gate it's a challenge oh no brother you don't understand i see angels with flaming swords yeah me too yeah but guess what they're doing they're not keeping the way of the gate any longer because of calvary they're asking you to come and open the gate but it requires effort on your part because it opens outward not inward that's where we're at that's what is going on in the world we live in today and brothers and sisters it's okay with me if you dispute it or you don't agree with it but i challenge you to try it in your life and see then watch if this series of
