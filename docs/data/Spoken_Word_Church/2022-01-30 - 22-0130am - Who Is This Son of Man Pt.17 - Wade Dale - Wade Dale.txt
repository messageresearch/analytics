so he's going to stop by and speak for us that sunday so keep those things in your prayer also brother joe gave me a um um he usually does this about once every quarter and it shows how many people

subscribers we've got 1476 subscribers so people watching in uh they're having a problem and we're talking about the internet now they have a problem with it today so uh it's on comcast it's not on

uk so that is a that's a lot 15 000 views in 90 days that's not bad that's not even a year that's only for that's only three months worth so um that's why that uh that we say that you know we we'd love to we'd love for you to be here because i want to read something i we you know and i were looking at something yesterday and somebody posted on facebook and it's really true the danger of missing church is that soon you don't miss it the danger of missing church is that soon you don't miss it wow god's never done away with church the bible's never done away with coming to church i know some people can't have to listen online and they don't have a place to go that's okay but still you can't go over what the bible says for satan not assembling yourself together and i know there's vacations and things you have to do work i'm not talking about that but when people disappear they hardly ever come back come on why because of that the danger of missing churches you just finally don't miss it well then the love of god is not in you amen if you don't love to come to church or if it doesn't if it doesn't uh boil in your heart to want to be somewhere listening to the word of god then uh then you need to be born again man that's just bottom line you need to be born again all right john 1 verse 1 and we're going to talk a little bit about head ship today and then i think uh what brother luis is going to be here this afternoon and do his uh presentation on when they all went to the central america but i want to get to a point and then maybe we'll stop but i want to get i asked y'all to listen to adoption series um that sunday that we didn't have church because of the weather and that's what we're going to continue into because you can't preach on the statue of perfect man without preaching adoption you can't bring the son of man in without preaching adoption because that's where it comes from he actually had to be adopted amen that's what we'll get to in just a little bit so god bless you we love you with the love of the lord just remember all these announcements remember the banquet next weekend like i said before get to know your spouse very well because we don't want that collins group to have that have that uh trophy two years in a row no can't happen have we ever had anybody get it two years in a row tony and esther maybe okay maybe so but anyway they're they're not gonna get it this year i'm talking about the collins ain't nothing about y'all we're gonna get rid of them all right who is this son of man but you really get to know your spouse and um it's fun we have a good time it's fun is that it looks dark and can y'all see that does it look dark can y'all lighten that up in the back a little bit or is our or is our thingy going out because i can barely see it all right so while they're working on that let's pray the heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us we pray that you would sanctify us lord today for a little while for this journey that we're on that will push the world back lord leave the demons at the door and come inside and listen to you father we pray this should bless us and take care of us lord as the bride of jesus christ we call out to you lord that we want to be adopted we want to be placed we want these things lord but not we don't want them without character because the prophet of god told us that power without character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule father we want to number one we want to have rulership over this body that we live in and then we want to have leadership lord we'll talk about that in a minute headship from you father all the way down father we're the bride of jesus christ we're the feminist part of you lord so we have to have headship we have to have a place to assemble we have to have a fivefold ministry lord that that talks to us about you father lord you set it up that way and it must be perfect because you're perfect so we must we must go by that father we pray that you bless the ones that are sick the ones that are not here we ask you to take care of the ones lord that are on the highways of traveling different things lord bad weather way up north father we pray that you bless the bride up there and be with each one father bless us and the furthermore their service forgive us of our many mistakes and sins in jesus name amen in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him how about this morning as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and he be we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word let's go to hebrews 10 5 again as we were talking wednesday night some of you that weren't here that wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice an offering thou what is not but a body has now prepared me now we know scripture has dual meaning all right there there was a body created by a creative act of god to create the egg and the germ place it in mary and here comes the flesh body of jesus but also if you can read this right you're going to read a bond he has now prepared me and and i believe he's talking about the bride because he needs a bride you say oh no god don't need anything okay he chose that he needed it okay can we just say that he chose that he needed it okay so it's his business to fulfill what he's already said and he will have a bride because he saw that there would be a bride and he would in type make it to be husband and wife to deliver a child the only way christ is going to be delivered to this earth is through who his bride because there's no other body this body that hebrews 10 5 this body that was created is sitting on the throne now it's not down here in this dimension amen the flesh of jesus is not here today but he has transferred like we read there in verse 12 of john to them gave he power transforming power to become the sons of god amen what a great thing a you know you you think about all the great men in the world and and we do give honor to the great men in the world that try to do things right and but you know what without god without the baptism of the holy ghost they're going to hell unless there be given eternal life but i don't want to have to go on my works i i'd hope bill gates and all those different ones don't have to want to go on their works because they may have pulled a shady dealer every once in a while to get where they're at maybe not but i don't want to deal with that i want to become the sons of god right here and not have to worry about being at the white throne because you don't have to go i said before but what happens is see we take headship down here they're going to have to remember the bible says every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess is that right every knee you're either going to be made to do it or you're going to do it now because you love him and i'd rather do it now because i love him if i do it now because i love him i don't have to do it as a white throne judgment because every knee is going to bow and every tongue is going to confess that jesus christ is lord well you know what confess him today that he's lord of your life he already has headship he already has been married to you he already is your husband he's the head of the body of the church as we're going to read here ephesians 5 verse 23 says for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body now headship watch this real quick i got notes wrote down some of you just got the paperwork i wrote the notes down on it so you got it too you got the cheat sheet i wrote the cheat sheet before i run you all the copy off so watch what it is though it's christ man or the husband and the woman everybody got that amen all god was he poured into christ christ poured into the church we understand that but let's make it really simple we know that god in christ is the same person okay christ the man the woman everybody got them okay lord jesus christ christ man the woman all right you take christ man the woman who's christ christ is the lord the man was jesus and the woman is the bride and you said no that's christ well where's christ where's christ today christ is the anointed one now where now we know that he was anointed but he's in a body somewhere else another dimension you and i paul says we have the mind of christ christ in you the hope of glory all these different things brother brown said what are the seals the seals are christ well as the seals is the seals going to be revealed to cars and planes and boats and and fiddles and no people people it's going to be revealed to people and people are going to manifest christ because if christ is in you and you have the mind of christ you're going to act like him that's what we're talking about with the statue of a perfect man see man really didn't know now i want you to understand this man really didn't know how to act until christ came we're going to read it here just a little while they were given a law do this don't do that do this don't do that amen but now when christ come he didn't do away with the law he made it where you could live it because they tried for years and every year they tried to live it and they always made a mistake because they always had to go back and make another sacrifice right amen i would say kind of got frustrating you know you you take david being a murderer and having his best friend killed and being an adulterer you know david he probably he went to church to try to get rid of that make his sacrifice say god i'm i'm sorry but it was still there because you know what even when he had his friend killed he still took bathsheba he didn't he didn't say no i messed up i shouldn't have done that no he took her and he married her and of course we know solomon came to that we know god uses those things but david would not have done that if he would have had the indwelling of the holy ghost inside of him he wouldn't have done what he did amen so under the law though he was condemned because remember nathan comes on the scene the the the prophet for the hour comes on the saint it says david he gave him a little parable and david said kill the man. nathan said david you're the man i'm talking about but david i prayed for you you're not going to die thank god we had a prophet show up in the end time and say i prayed for you and now you can make it you're not going to die oh we may physically have to go but somebody's not going to according to what the hour the prophet in the end time told us i've prayed for you right amen i prayed for you people you're going to make it somebody's going to make this thing amen why not just believe it's you colossians 1 verse 15 but remember lord jesus christ headship christ man and the woman and we know that you know what you and i are what you and i are the female everybody got that all of us male men and women under the headship of being bride what do we do we take the veil i'm working on something there we're looking back in traditions about the veil the only person that didn't wear a veil back in the really old times and way back was prostitutes and people that were married because you'd already hurt you had a bae alone and when you got married you took that veil off amen and and you become what you become mrs whoever that was standing there that's the same way with me and you we don't have to wear a veil again we ought to let the world know we're married to jesus christ because the world knew when you were married and you walked down the street they didn't have wedding rings back then it was a testimony though that either you were a prostitute which meant you had already been married a few hundred times or you were married to a husband and then they said oh that person's married what can people do me and you the same way oh there goes a christian amen because that's our outward appearance that's the only way the world's going to see it right right amen i don't know why y'all quiet today i ain't really got on you yet yeah colossians 1 verse 5 not going to colossians 1 verse 15 who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature we read this wednesday let's go down to 18. he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence so god had to come in human flesh we know that we've been talking about it for 17 sermons that god came down in human flesh to show us how to act when god would come inside of us amen it's really simple and if you don't portray it then you don't have the fruits of the spirit inside of you like jesus christ did he'll be okay with that all right now let's go to number one quote where brother brown says but the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it all jesus came on the scene now remember he was the fullness of the word right everywhere god but he's still learned by the things he suffered and being made perfect we read those scriptures you say oh no jesus well humanly he was not perfect he was god there was nothing wrong with his word he'd have to take his word back but there were certain things as a human being that thank god they didn't put it in the put it in here about you know like brother dale always said he thought god uh jesus was so much god that he couldn't stump his toe or he couldn't know no he got splinters he fell and busted his knee and probably busted his head where's jonas at jonas back there in the back got a little got a knot on his eyeball where he fell and hit the hit the corner of the table at his house well you know what jesus probably had a shine or two you already know what that is a shiner is something you get you know when somebody pops you in the eye or you fall and hit something but jesus was that way because he learned by the things he suffered even when he was 13 years old in the temple doing the work of his father right the bible says after they found him he became subject unto him he didn't turn around and say now bless god i'm god no could have but that wasn't in him to do that it wasn't in him to say that it was anything to say okay i gotta learn i know i gotta learn i know who my father is number one see that's what we've got all of us today we've got to learn who our father is amen listen your father may be a natural father he may be gone but your spiritual father if you're born again is god all right so god's your father so you're not fatherless all right so the body was built by the word which was the prophets here comes the head of all of it jesus came on the scene now we talked about headship headship means power authority and honor listen everything comes from the head right everything all your intelligence the whatever makes my hand move the reason i'm gesturing with my hand is because my brain is telling it to do that right that's exactly what it's doing it's telling me exactly you know or you know that hurt so don't do that again but it all comes from the head so christ is the head and that's what we've been looking at for the past 17 sermons but what happened was is back in the first church age when jesus christ left they didn't understand full headship does everybody okay with that they did and i'll read where you brother brown tells he said they had just enough just enough to get born again just enough to say i'm a born-again believer just enough to say god is my father and i'm going to live a good christian life now that's what the prophet of god said but remember the son of man stood one day and says i don't have a place to lay my head we were talking about that wednesday he said the son of man has no place to lay his head well he didn't have a place he couldn't rest listen on the day of pentecost on the day of pentecost that was the rest that's right come to me all you labor and heavy laden and i'll give you rest brother brown said it wasn't a day it was what happened to them right like he's talking about saturday you know everybody wants to we're not everybody but this whole witness and all the sabbatarians want to do it on saturday which is fine that's okay but sunday we honor the resurrection but he said there was no day the bible even tells you paul tells us there's no day that you're supposed to listen we're supposed to have sunday every day we're supposed to portray the resurrection every day when you get up listen when you get older i'm 62 now it is a resurrection when i get up every morning for some of y'all young ones that just jump up and throw your shoes on and sh your hair around and throw a little deodorant and head out the door god bless you you get a little bit older and you'll be like i need to do this in shifts feet get up arms but you know what that's the part of getting older but the resurrection should be every day because the resurrection being every day what was he was the first to raise headship he was if everything he did was first he was the first fruit he was the first one to be born without sex born now see adam wasn't born he said no adam no adam was created adam wasn't born jesus was the first one to be born without sex he was the first one to have the preeminence in his life that the father spoke to him and he did what the father said and then he what taught us that and then they killed him put him in a grave and he was the first one to resurrect by itself i want you all to understand that jesus had to pray for lazarus to be resurrected there had to be prayer for jerusale's daughter to be resurrected there had to be somebody in her seed who interceded for jesus no he stood up one day and he said you destroy this body and i'll raise it up in three days he didn't say the second person of a trinity or he didn't say my father he said i'll raise it back up folks we're gonna take that to a grave one day graves and they'll resurrect from that right there that's what they'll resurrect from that the resurrection's inside of you and then the call is going to come from what the bride the bride is going to make that call it's not going to be now listen don't get me wrong it's not going to be god telling jesus jesus telling the preacher and the preacher telling us i know that's how you get communication but you're not going to have to call brother dale brother bob and say can i go out there i just got a real feeling that i can get raise somebody from the dead today you ain't got to call nobody because adoption is the name on the checkbook listen if gee i'm getting a little ahead of myself but if jesus wrote the check and cast it yes and he gives you power and authority to write the check and cash it see where we're at see what we're looking at when this adoption comes that's why adoption is it's really uh uh it's it's been portrayed all down through centuries from from israel all the way to today but it's got to pertain to something else it's not an adoption like you have a different set of parents and you're adopted no it's adoption and we'll talk about in just a few minutes we'll go through the tutors and the governor is that okay but that's what i want to get to because that's listen that's what's holding us back folks listen we can have a church full and i pray of born-again believers from the front door to the back door and still the resurrection won't come until we come to maturity until we come as brother um donnie and the different ones said you know the teaching part of it brother bob the teaching part of it is what we need to bring us you know i i just don't understand how preacher in this message can stand up and say we don't need teaching anymore well you know why he said that he needed teaching i mean that's the whole thing he needed teaching you know people get up and they say well well i'm not of this or i'm not of that and you're like you're the very thing that you complain about most of us are hello so anyway beam remember beam and and and two before and and toothpick okay but we need teaching because as you read it today teaching places you i want to be placed because i don't you know it's great being a christian i love it i've had a good 20-something year run of being a true born-again christian and i love it but what am i still doing here i'm getting older i got more birthdays coming up i'm heading toward an end but not if you're born again now if you're born again not to if you take what this message means sure this message means and we'll get to in just a little while it is do's and don'ts it is a school master to start you off with that's right but now if you're still work having a problem with your hair and your dress and your men you know having a little beer every once in a while and saying a custom word every once in a while you're not born again period sorry you just ain't so work from there okay that's babies that's and you can't be a baby not a problem we all started babies but i can't stand a 60 year old crying baby amen i mean back to diapers and no teeth and screaming and crying and yeah you understand what i'm saying god told moses one day said you speak to that rock and he messed up because he wasn't in the right position because he smote the rock and when he smoked the rock i was just reading it this morning god said moses i love you i appreciate you you did everything i told you to do it said one thing now you see what i mean what is our promised land sure it's the baptism the holy ghost but i promise land is a change of the body and our promised land is adoption that's what that's what you see that moses when then went through the wilderness and then joshua took him into the land to place them according to adoption he placed them in the land moses didn't get to go because one thing he did god said i told you to speak to it and said you hit it and you hit it didn't hit it one time you hit it twice disobedience one thing look how great moses was spoke lift the ear to god and god said because you didn't do one thing in other words you exalted yourself the prophet said you exalted yourself above me when you had to hit the rock because it was something you did moses you were supposed to speak it and then go forward that's the same way with me and you it's not going to be and don't get me wrong it's not going to be how many hands we lay on and how much we scream and shout right here right here head ship the head is the only place you can talk from your body just displays what you're talking about i know sometimes we people say things and their body don't don't follow behind it but that's kind of the way we are with jesus christ because he's the head and we're the body and sometimes we don't do what he says why because we're not adopted we're not we've not come to a place to where he can say here's the checkbook now we'll get to that in just a little bit but let's go to psalms 85 9. that thing is not going to get any brighter richer it's dying in it lay hands on the sick that thing's been good though it's been up there a long time i'm talking about the uh projector but that's why we're trying to get this finished over here so that we can have some really clear numbers but i'm sorry if you can't see that but i love this scripture it says surely his salvation is not in the fear that glory may dwell in our land mercy and truth are met together see something had to come together listen a husband and wife has to come together before a child's born so god had to become man so that he could connect with us that he could come back on the day of pentecost and say that's my bride but that wasn't all i want to have a baby but i don't want that baby to stay a baby i want that baby to grow grow in grace and knowledge mercy and truths are met righteousness and peace have kissed each other truth shall spring out of what out of this earth not the ball we're not talking about the ball of the earth but come about this earth and righteousness shall look down from heaven number two and layout to see in church age the prophet of god says when god created himself with bodies talking about hebrews let me talk about revelations 3 14 when god created himself a body he came down and lived in it isn't that familiar it now what he did on the day of pentecost we say oh no that was when he after when we you know when uh easter or i'm not easter but april when we christmas time you know when little baby jesus was born god came and lived in it yeah okay well that's how it got started but that's not gonna do you any good till he comes and lives in you really simple when god created himself a body and that's what he's doing now he's creating himself a body a bride a bride body he came down and lived in it that's the beginning of the creation of god now remember he's the beginning but what you and i are the continuation of that amen you and i are the continuation wake up amen we've got some nurses we got if you have heart failure then we i got some dr glycerin somewhere so that i don't need to take any anymore thank god so uh but i got it so in case some of y'all need it when i do that i want you to stroke out on me but just don't go to sleep it is warm it is warm up here but that's okay when god created himself a body he came down and lived in that's the beginning of the creation of god oh isn't he wonderful hebrews 5 verse 8 says though he were a son yet learn the obedience by the things we suffer now we're going to get into that in galatians where paul picks that up in adoption because see that's me and you i'm telling you folks we're pushing all these scriptures to well you're talking about jesus well you're talking about no i'm not about you are you not a son of god though he were a son though donnie foxbush was a son he's a son he can't be was a son if you were born you're always going to be a son you may have different titles but you're always going to be a son of something yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect jesus said be therefore perfect even my father in heaven why he opened the door to perfection listen i know he was god almighty in human flesh but he lived a human life but he was almighty god now can you not live a human life and be almighty god yes you can if you'll yield yourself like he did he's given us that opportunity he's opened that door i am the door right listen he may have shut it to the world but he's oh he's left it open to me and you open door open book we're in all the open everything open heaven open skies just reach in and get it right it's wonderful to say all that door's open that door is open there's a million dollars inside there that door's open you can stand out there and you can die of poverty until you go get it until you go get it i love i'm talking about chris long the other day and he's been preaching on the statue of perfect man i'm glad everybody started preaching on the statue of perfect man i am glad that but he said look he said ever he he showed me a picture and he drew up a line because right here there's a line with a you know like a point a line pointing up like this he said every time you come to each one of these you come to a crossroad across right road every one of them you come to a crossroad why you can either continue or you can stop or you can go in another direction because brother branham he's talking about he said oh you get all the way up here and you ain't got the holy ghost yet well that's what seals you in the true baptism not that you got a false one but you got the baptism of the holy ghost in a baby form baby and it's okay to cry but man god doesn't want people to cry he's made you and give you the open book the open door and the open revelation so that you can take what he had listen show me in the bible matthew mark luke and john where jesus had to beg for anything work it up let's read the other day you know he was dealing with those demons and the demons was telling him what to do remember demon says no don't let us go in no swine over there and all jesus said was go he didn't have to build anything up but his presence when he walked up to that uh maniac of gadara the legion that had thousands of demons in him the demon said why have you come here thou son of god see they were in the spirit world that's why some people don't like you i've got something in my pocket brother dick addison gave me i'm going to read it you ready brother did give me this long time ago he said some people will never like you because your spirit irritates their demons [Laughter] one more time some people will never like you because your spirit irritates their demons that's what i want to happen listen if you don't like me you got a problem i don't you do i think that's his handwriting i thought maybe gail did it but nope that's dick's handwriting thank god thank god we knew a man named dick anderson did you know what a lot of people didn't like dick a lot of people didn't like dick why he was different that's okay i like different right maybe your demons got irritated irritated by his spirit hmm think about that chew on that for a week and figure out what's going on go to work and say okay but look we're heading towards something let's get back to the subject and being made perfect he became the author now being an author he had to write something right being an author he had what and the author is the originator he wrote this book so that we can live it is okay with that being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that what obey him obedience is better than sacrifice isn't that what samuel told told saul saul said i think i'll do it my way i'm going to save them because i'm going to get some information from them kings and and we're going to take some of them cows we're going to take some of them horses and we're going to take some of them mules and we're going to add it to my kingdom what's the first thing samuel said he said i hear something i'm not supposed to be hearing i hear the blatant of the sheep and i hear the cows moving didn't god tell you i told you saul to kill everything men women children and animals and there was uh og and the other king sitting there well what's the first thing samuel done samuel says saul the king the kingdom's been ripped from you rendered from you because you didn't do what god said here we go again somebody didn't do something god said he took the kingdom away from saul and give it to one better which we know it was david but what samuel do he didn't walk out the door prophets must have carried swords too because he pulled his sword and cut both of his head off pretty messy you say oh he's a nice prophet yeah he's nice when you did what he said but he's the one who killed the two kings that was supposed to die obedience then true we see is great better than sacrifice okay obedience he wasn't obedient but this man was obedient matthew 3 verse 16. jesus when he was baptized went straight out of the water and he saw the spirit of god descending like the dove and lighted on him now this is the beginning and we're going to get to this just in a minute and he saw the spirit of god descending like the dove and light on him below a voice from heaven saying what this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased all right now that was at your new birth god said the same thing to you we already been through that but now he was not well pleased to hear you him he was pleased to help you start your journey okay he was pleased to help you start your journey then he gave you what tutors and governors we'll read in just a minute to help you along the way listen if you deny headship anywhere down the line pastor's the head of the church there's always headship christ is the head of the bride you're the head of your wife and you know you know the bible tells you to treat your wife the way you want god to treat you you better be careful thank you some of you some of you maybe need to think about that but that's what the bible says the bible tells you that we've seen women through the ages they take that stuff literal which is you know that's their people's business but um listen your wife's not dog meat if she's born again she is not dog meat she is not to be run over amen but you sisters are not supposed to be the head of the family either so you see what the balance is there's a wonderful balance there if you'll get into balance instead of having to be you know people forget where they came from people forget that christ with loving hands saved your heart and saved your soul amen and then you become obedient to him and even when you're not obedient to him he doesn't slap you down on the ground what's our worst enemy god or me right you that's not your worst enemy you are you beat yourself up way more and god beats you up because he does it with nail scarred hands meanest man i know number three we'll get here real quick jesus first doctrine it was what ye must be born again we went through that before now let's go to number four it is the rising of the sun he said i'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to christ we're getting them to a church to a theory see that's why we need to find full ministry we need to find full ministry we need a we need a evangelist to come by and stir up get your heart mellow get your heart pliable where where then somebody can come in then and teach you yeah all right that's the way it works and it works perfect because you know what god said if you'll listen to these five it'll perfect you pretty simple well why don't we do it i mean we do but i mean why does not the world just fall over and say well we'll just do it no people don't want headship if you're not born again you're not you're going to deny headship and who's you you deny headship christ don't deny his ship you're denying headship all right i'm afraid too many of us are getting the p not getting the people to christ we're getting them to a church or a theory but we must get them to christ he is the only one and the only one that has life all right there's not life in anything else let's go to matthew 17 verse 5. and while he yet spake now this is this is jesus from matthew 2 or three when he was born as a baby to now matthew 17 he's only six months the prophet said he's only six months away from dying so what am i saying it may take your whole life to come to that place but you can come to that place if you'll be obedient i mean jesus was 30 years walking and then three years of ministry before jesus was taken in type up on a mountain he was taken on the mountain and overshadowed and said here ye him now while he had spate behold a bright light overshadowed them he behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son and whom i am well pleased that's the same thing he said three years before but he added a little something to it he'd come to a position he said hear ye him and when they had lifted their eyes they saw no man save jesus only that's verse 8. and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged him saying tell this vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead now we know what happened the son of man was rejected put on a cross ascended up the son of man ascended and came back the son of god on the day of pentecost does everybody got that so the headstone stayed up there where it was because man had shut him off i'm just telling you what the prophet said because the son of man didn't come till the end time all right and his disciples said why then say the scribes of the lies must first come and jesus answered and said to them elish truly shall first come and restore all things we gotta have a restoration back to what back to the truth we lost the truth that's why god couldn't work except a little bit in luther and a little bit in wesleyan a little bit in pentecost remember i'll read them i'll read the quote but now let's go to the next one right there um whoever's running but now look here's matthew 17 verse 5. jesus has come to a place where god says hear ye him brother brown said six months later they crucified him well between that time that six months of his three and a half year ministry kind of strange he preached the seals he didn't preach the sales in matthew 4 8 10 not even 17. he preached him in matthew 24. so he had to come to a position listen the prophet that god preached on the seals p clarence larkin preached on the seals this one preached on the seals but brother adam had to come to a place of adoption he had to go out to arizona and be positionally placed before he could preach the real revelation of the seals his real message not that the other message was false okay but he preached the seals in matthew 24. now let's look at the order and this is how me and you are supposed to come you can't come any other way because you know what this is the way jesus came he's first fruits right he's when he came to maturity first he's the one that took a a rapture first he's the one that took a body change first everybody got that so what was his first what was his first sermon three and a half years ago from this moment of death on this side you must be born again pleased to dwell same thing with you if you're born again today all right then you got he had to come to what a time of obedience everybody everybody with me obedience learn learn learn he obedience learned we obedience by the things we suffered suffered yeah read all them the way brother branham explained them and what it does it really just grabs at the root of you and pulls everything out of you that your old nature was if you had a temper maybe you didn't want to lose it but if you keep praying enough god's going to jerk it out i'll hold my hand down patience patience patience jim's stepmom had a sign in her kitchen said lord give me patience but i want it right now ain't that the way we are though they that waited upon the lord all right so here's your birth he's pleased to dwell in you he don't want you to stay a baby so it jesus learned by the things he suffered learned he obedience of things he suffered then he had to go up and then he went up on a mountain all this life of three years that he lived of ministry healing the sick raising the dead doing the different things he was doing listening to god so he takes him up on a mountain and says now hear ye him and brings it to adoption or placing that's what he's got to do to me and you because see our problem is here's our problem in the message we want to go from right here to right here and skip all that in between we want to go from kindergarten to calculus 202 in you know our sophomore year in college michael it ain't happening buddy sorry ain't that it right man calculus was hard for me all of those stuff was easy but calculus all them other oh man so anyway but you know what i had to learn if i took my courses like i was supposed to take them then i'd understand it later on you must be born again so please to dwell then everybody don't want to lord i need patience lord i need virtue i need knowledge i just want to get right here well if my boss is mad at me at me i'll just zap him right out of the distance i'll make his car blow up because i don't like him i hate him whoa we need some temperance number one and then we need some paces number two and you surely don't present any godliness in that scenario that's okay i'll ask you a question be honest with me you don't raise your hand how many of you are working at a job that you worked when you weren't born again and now you're working in the same job now you're born again how do you react i don't mean the same job physically in the same building but say you were say i work for the post office and then i got born again and then i still work for the post office is there something different do you handle things different you better have because if you're still if they still think you're that same old person you're not born again you got you got to get in line you got to get in the line here's the lineup you must be born again god pleased to dwell in you obedience come to church read your bible pray say god help that preacher that's going to preach to me today how many of you did that this morning don't raise your hand i don't want you embarrassed listen folks a lot of y'all just come to church just because you want to come to church now some of y'all don't come to church half the time but that's okay you'll learn somewhere if you get born again you'll want to be here okay you don't have to preach about it you want to be here but look don't try to be a witness when you're still in kindergarten okay you got to become a son and we'll talk about just a second obedience my whole life your whole life is built on obedience right right you get out today and when i say dismissed you're going to go out that door right there most of you right but you're not going to get up and leave until i dismiss that's obedience then you're going to go downstairs and you're not going to eat somebody else's food well unless you me and sister cleaner you go but you're not gonna go over there and set the table and start eating my hamburger what you've learned something you'll be obedient you're gonna get your hand slapped god's going to slap your hand every once in a while right but now what's a little kid going to do one of them little kids will go like wow cheeseburger don't ask who it is they're just going to grab it why because they may be a son but they learned by the things they suffered obedience you go get in your car and guess what you're obedient to the laws of the land amen you stop at that stop time because what that's what you're obedient so see we've learned obedience in the world so now let's take that obedience and learn it from god to get into the not to get into the do's and don'ts of the old testament we'll get into it just a second but it's a love affair now listen jim cooks me dinner because she wants to a lot of times i don't want anything to eat but she's please eat you know i'll fix it see that's a love affair that's not a listen sisters and brothers if y'all have to get up and have to make somebody do something god bless you no god help you yes right god help you but see we learn obedience though then what does god do god says okay now i wrote the check see i got the checkbook god said i got the checkbook and i'm going to write a check as brother brother would always say bank of heaven you got a daddy now because you've been born into the family so you're connected to the inheritance we're going to read it in just a minute you're connected to the inheritance nobody got that all right once you're connected to the inheritance you get a check but it's already written because you don't know what to write it for come on and you might write it for a million dollars and you ain't got two dollars in the bank but if god writes it for a million dollars signs the check and hands it to you you can go to the bank with it healing same way deliverance same way salvation same way amen amen but now when you come down to here that's what we got to get to he hands you the blank check then he knows you're not going to write it for a million if you've only got two dollars in the bank because you've been obedient you've been taught you've been taught to ask and you shall receive here you him it's where we're coming to the part of adoption and then now don't get me wrong i got the seals way down here i to me that's the opening to you not when excuse me not when somebody preaches them or not when you sit down and you want to listen to the 60-something tapes that brother dale preached in 1982 which you should if you want to understand the seals but see you're listening to them up here but the culmination of the seals is when we leave this place it bounces full full redemption the opening of the seventh seal is christ is back on earth again where in his bride because he's not coming he's already hearing me and you but we've got to understand that what we've got to become obedient by the statue of a perfect man by listening to a prophet apostle prophet pastor's teachers and evangelists for the perfecting of the saints for the edifying of the body so that's the order are they okay with that that's the order i want to read this quote here what visions are in 1956 we read this the other day and from then on down it's been a day where the light went out the bread and it's been a daylight enough that you could see that jesus was the son of god you should repent this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell he he was as pleased to dwell in martin luther sitting at a beer sitting at a pub drinking beer smoking a pot because martin luther said to just shall live by faith i am protesting what's going on in the religious world and god said i'm going to use that right now the other things wesley what he did away with that pentecost the gifts came up and then we had the word of god comes everybody okay with that see god works the same way he don't just dump everything on top of you that's why the church ages if you don't read the church age book and get a good understanding of the church ages and how god walked through the church ages you might as well not read the seal book because you're not going to understand it see daylight enough that you could see that jesus was the son of god you should repent but the real bright light the real bright light i'm telling you what the prophet said you can read it for yourself but the real bright light of the holy ghost has never shined through these ages wow it took a profit to say that how mean you going to say that no a prophet told us that certainly the bible said it wouldn't as the prophet said it wouldn't just assure he said they couldn't believe because isaiah said there hasn't been light remember there'll be light in the evening time that's been enough light to know that you ought to do right and wrong that's been enough light now that you believed on resurrection the lord jesus every christian believes that's what it's based on accept him as your personal savior that's what it's based on put your name on the church book and live the good life but as far as signs and wonders and direct ray of the sun shining it hasn't been since pentecost and that was in 1906 that was 80 30. everybody got that i'm just telling you what the prophet of god said so there had to be in the church ages there had to be a growth but no one was there to teach you the growth listen listen luther was not luther wasn't standing in the in the excuse me in the sardisian church age and said i'm the messenger of the sardis and this is my message no he just preached the message that you shall live by faith but it took a prophet of god in the end time to reveal these things put everything together that's why that if if these people that are denying that brother branham was a prophet well folks even in his error he was real good if they say error i'm not saying error i'm just saying he don't have he didn't he didn't preach there now he preached things that wasn't right at one time but see there you go progressive revelation he sits down he sits down in the seals and he sits down and he starts writing the same notes that he was writing when he was preaching the mighty conqueror when the seals wasn't open to him when he was what growing in grace and knowledge and he preached that the white horse rider was the holy ghost conquering the ages conquering this and he's sitting there writing the same thing but now see god has brought him to adoption and god said william branham i've let you do that for a few years for you to learn but today you can't preach that because now it's here ye him time no that man you preached on the white horse is the antichrist remember what brother brown said he said i made a heart would have made a horrible mistake today when the holy ghost had to come into the room and what corrected him on why i'm almost verbatim quoting it why brother bryan may come to an adoption he come to a place to where and yeah you're listen from 47 to 65 you're supposed to listen to him okay okay but the real message he had was when the sales broke not in the years of preparation but the trumpet we're supposed to listen to is when the seals open not saying don't listen to rest listen because what is the rest the rest of it is foundation just like me and you foundation wide way down here but all of a sudden you come up to where this is only about seven feet wide see a one two three four five six seven we got a seven seal mystery but what did he say it did though he said it opened the entire book so now you and me at the opening of the seals we can go back down here teach it preach it talk about it and what let somebody carry you up let somebody what pull you up the mountain some of us kicking and screaming some of us not but me kicking and screaming so now to save time let's go all the way if y'all don't mind go all the way to where it says colossians 1 verse 18. and whoever's running it i don't know anderson who's running it back there okay so scroll all the way to colossians 118. i want to get to this right here let's just look you know we always thank you we always say that there's three stages of grace right three stages of your birth justification stance catching baptism in the holy ghost but we had the prophet come in the end time and said there's four amen there's four justifications sanctification baptism in the holy ghost and the word open the word being revealed all right that's what we're coming to so so if y'all some of y'all got that written down that i wrote down on there it's birth growth adoption and seals which is obedience hear you him and headship that's what was rejected that little part right up there was the opening of the seals because christ was the seal he preached to myself and then he had to what go away because no one would understand that part they would understand this part because listen peter james and john had these virtues working in their life because ii peter i didn't read it i skipped over it peter's one that told you how to live that add to your faith virtue and your verse of knowledge knowledge temperance temperance patience and it'll make you it will make you verse 8. ii peter don't go back to it for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be bear nor and fruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ maybe that's not what we're why we're not getting what we're supposed to get but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off revelation and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sin so let's go to colossians 1 18. he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that him should all fullness dwell now right here real quick let's go to number seven the prophet of god tells us somebody asked him are you the son of man that was questions and answers are you the son of man be awake just for a minute with me here it's coming you saw it coming and you still jumped quit that but the question was are you the son of man i'm not he i'm his servant and look this this is kind of brother bob this kind of got me a little bit but still it's a position the pillar of fire's not him because a pillar of fire's right here listen this son of man is inside of me and you and you can't see nothing except what me and you do you can have a pill of fire all over your head and you have it all over your body and be the devil hello but if you got him inside of you you can never be the devil the pillar of fire is not he it's in spirit form which was upon the son of man has come now to anoint sons of men to bring back a ministry just exactly like he said it would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect together that's a promise but look watch scroll it up i'm gonna read it right here the pyramid arena was built we find the pyramid they never did get the headstone on if you see the pyramids there's a flat top on it don't go to a point for that top flat top the headstone's yet to come that's 1964. because brother brown knew that when the headstone hit listen he'd already preached the sale so he knew there was somebody going to come to that somebody was going to make it to that the seven steps in the pyramid we'll go through that someday i'd like to show you how it really is perfect with a scripture and now if you notice on your american dollar he talks about the dollar scrolling up down to here when that stone comes it'll be a great diamond fitting right down in there just perfect we showed you the picture of it just perfect with it because it's got to be inside of you not just laying on top of you it's got to be down inside of you it's got to husband and wife husband and wife uniting time where nothing can take you apart right i want to say this real quick sisters and brothers young sisters and brothers hold on to your virginity that's the greatest thing they can't nobody take that away from you except some stinking man or your beautiful husband or wife so see god's got to have a bride a virtuous sinless bride you say oh wait wait i've done so much stuff hold on i'm telling you what god said by the transforming power of god something happened but you girls like brother brown said he said you can be what forgiven but you can't be justified you never go back being a virgin again ladies and gentlemen that are not now sitting in this building is that not true that's the greatest thing you can do is keep yourself and give yourself to one man or one woman and you and i as the bride of jesus christ give ourselves to one man and that's jesus christ quit messing around with all these other things quit messing around with these ideas that we got i'm talking about all of us i want that diamond not just lay on top i want it to drive inside of me so hard to you can't pull it apart once that head gets on that body you can't pull it apart but that's what is coming now it what brother i'm knew it wasn't then it's coming now this is when it's going to happen now that stone would not fit down on the bottom foundation neither it fit on the second or the third it only fits on the top foundation he's talking about the seven churches when the entire building has become the fitted fitted the stone and jesus cannot come until a church a body of believers and the ministry that he wants what he once had the three and a half year ministry of jesus christ was there an error in that three and a half year ministry of jesus christ no sir well you don't see it this way and i don't see it that way it's three and a half or seven or there is a truth folks and it's one truth they ain't three different truths two there's not two different truths i like what brother brown said brother brown said look either you're right and i'm wrong or we're both wrong because we both can't be right think about that it only fits the top foundation when the entire building has become fitted to the stone and jesus cannot come until a church a body of believers and the ministry that he wants will have to be the same as it was what what's he trying to say he's stumbling through this but it's the same ministry of jesus christ the same three and a half minutes your message of jesus christ then without us cannot be made perfect paul said hebrews 11 without us they cannot be perfected they must have this ministry to raise up the lutheran's western and all them down through their ages let's read galatians real quick and that's what we'll get started on next week next sunday let's go to galatians 3 verse 18. and we'll get to we'll break it down but to me this explains everything real quick and then musicians come all right look for if the inheritance be of the law now what is our inheritance the baptism of the holy ghost that's our promise it's the baptism of the holy ghost the promise is i god am going to give you eternal life okay that's the promise promise has been all the way since adam that's right that's right for the and it's our inheritance for the inherent if the inheritance be of the law then it's no more promise if you'll do this and don't do that no no but god gave it to abraham by promise abraham i don't care what you're going to do i'm going to give you the promise wherefore then serveth the law this is paul now it was added because of transgression listen it had to be added before christ came so that you could at least have some kind of a spiritual rudder you could know that you did something wrong know you were a sinner know that you need to make a sacrifice but you made a sacrifice every year for the same identical thing listen if you're beating yourself up now for the same identical thing you ask god to forgive you for got to start forgiving yourself because god's going to say what are you talking about where'd you get that from i think that's way down in that sea they call forgetfulness wherefore then servant the law it was added because of transgressions what till the seed should come to who the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hands of a mediator the old testament the prophets wrote about that's this man coming now a mediator is not a mediator of one but god is one now watch is the law then against the promises of god god forbid so another stan in other words understand this you don't throw the law out because the law is god that's right god said there's only one god god said honor your father and mother god said that no i wasn't the third person said that god said that it's the law then against the promises of god god forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life that's why you got to understand there was no eternal life given to anybody in the old testament except for adam and eve the blood of bulls and goats couldn't take away verily righteousness should have been by the law in other words jesus wouldn't have to come the law would have saved you but the scripture have concluded all i like paul all of you are sinners they said right that the promise by faith of jesus christ that's why that faith is down at the bottom the faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe but before faith came look before faith came where were we we were in the world condemned by the law of god but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed right because that's what's going to condemn you is the law not just totally the ten commandments but the ten commandments are pretty much all the law but look the law then though when you came to christ there was a schoolmaster wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith has come you don't need the law to tell you do's and don'ts like i said before like brother dale's always said you sisters you men if you get born again you will not do the things you used to do now if you halfway get there yeah like i said before your husband's got to be dead not divorced because he will always pop his head back up right but once you kill him and put him in a grave nah he ain't coming back but after that faith has come we are no longer under schoolmaster we've moved up because now look you can stop right here paul and we just don't need nothing we got the new birth but he's not done yet for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ there is neither jew nor greek there's neither bond or free neither male or female for you're all one in christ jesus and if you be christ and you are abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise now go to the next this is the continuation he wrote he comes down to galatians four verse one now i say see he could have left that up there what we just read before you don't need a school master anymore in other words you just go right on to college first grade right on to college that's not the way it is now i say that the heir as long as he's a white child difference nothing from a servant though he'd be lord of all but his under tutors and governors he does need some more teaching he does need to be taught but he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children babies newborn babes that's not a problem staying there is the problem we're in bondage under the elements of the world that's okay that was things you know i and i try to say well you should never do anything that you did in the world now that's not totally true you understand what i'm saying you don't go you don't go to the bar anymore you don't go grab the beer out of the refrigerator you don't go watch this or you that's gone but they'll steal some things that we humanly do that make mistakes you were in bondage under the elements of the world look but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that was us we were under the law dead that we might receive the adoption of sons now watch adoption of sons not adoption i'mma read it in romans 8 we receive the spirit of adoption when you get born again you don't receive adoption adoption in your new birth is two different things totally i'll read you the quote next week brother brown said your new birth is not your adoption all right so it's two separate things that we might receive the adoption of sons in other words you've got to be a son first before you can receive the adoption and because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart crying crying babies crying daddy daddy that's what that means father father wherefore there are no more a servant but a son and if a son than an heir of god through christ come on musicians we'll stop right there but look it's all a process why do you think we've all been here some of us been in this message since the 60s 70s 80s and we're in 2022 20 22. 20 22. we were about not wanting about not getting to 1972 at one time but we're here why are we here we still got baby stuff all of us but listen there should be a time that we grow up let's stand up in god how can i do it i just read you the formula tutors and governors come to church read your bible listen to tape listen to the preacher listen to the evangelists we bring in listen to the sunday school teacher and everything is going to listen if you're born again god's obligated to give you the word if you're born again and you sit down and say god i don't know what that man's saying but you said you'd tell me because i'm a son and my heir the air that what i have the promise that i have is is all this you promised me faith you promised me virtue you promised me knowledge temperance patience garland's brother economy you promised me that i'd come to a place to where my name was as good on the checkbook as yours and i wouldn't write a bad check amen i'd write to check that god wants you to write that's what me and you have got to come to the mind of god working in a group of people sing it take not thy holy spirit from me [Music] restore [Music] within me there's david david said created me a new heart [Music] [Applause] thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] away [Music] [Music] [Applause] holy spirit [Music] the joy of thy salvation [Music] listen everybody's wanting to go find this third pole and all these things it's god pulling you up that that's what the third pull is is god pulling you up that statue of a perfect man to where your name is as good on the checkbook as the father's and that's what he wants it's not something that we're going to come to and surprise god he's made a way for it to be that way it's a requirement in this age for us to come to that if not either we're not born again or we're just not gonna you're not gonna take a body change but god said he would do it folks if we would ask him we sing that song i feel the pull do you really feel a pull do you really feel god pulling you know when you pull up vegetables and you pull up all these things you're pulling up you're uprooting i want god to uproot my uproot me and plant himself inside of me uproot me lord take it all cause you know what there's some weeds in there it might be some good carrots or some good radishes or something but there's also some weeds in them so pull it up out of me lord feel the pull the pull of this ages for us to what be able to understand god when he speaks to us when we don't have to worry was that god or was that not god take it one more time to be dismissed [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] be back at two o'clock brother me [Music]
