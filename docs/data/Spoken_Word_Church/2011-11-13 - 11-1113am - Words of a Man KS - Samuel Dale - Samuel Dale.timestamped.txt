[34:29] Hebrews 1. I'm just the kind of a guy
[34:33] that I like to
[34:36] speak to people and and I like to get
[34:39] you to thinking
[34:41] I don't like to see you standing there
[34:43] with a blank face and you know I mean
[34:46] I'd rather see you frowning than to see
[34:48] you with this blank
[34:49] I'd rather see you saying what in the
[34:51] world is this guy talking about than to
[34:53] just I don't care what he says yeah
[34:56] but I'd like to get you to think
[35:00] because that means that God can speak to
[35:02] you've read a random said a minister and
[35:04] only one thing a gift
[35:07] and he said that gift was to get
[35:11] to block that spell that Satan has over
[35:13] your eyes
[35:16] he said where God can speak to you
[35:19] so that's all a gift is for and that's
[35:21] what we're doing okay let's pray father
[35:23] we thank you for your love and your
[35:25] grace unto us we thank you for this day
[35:26] and this opportunity Lord we love you
[35:29] and we pray that you would just come
[35:30] this day now and speak to us touch our
[35:32] wife Lord and let everything be well to
[35:34] me with the church there we know they're
[35:36] already in service and just bless and
[35:38] take care of everything be Wade over at
[35:40] Bartlesville Arbor brother cloud and
[35:43] images blessing just let your love be
[35:45] made manifest with each one of us as we
[35:47] read your word you come and speak to our
[35:49] hearts because we love you and we thank
[35:51] you in Jesus name amen
[35:55] and I came off and had to bar glasses
[35:57] because mine's left in the cabin
[35:59] so
[36:00] if I don't read right it'll be Jim's
[36:02] fault
[36:04] you know reading through other people's
[36:05] glasses you know
[36:07] all right
[36:09] verse 12.
[36:11] very familiar with everybody then it's
[36:13] fake Joshua hey man I can read it here I
[36:15] didn't need no glasses brother Jim
[36:17] okay all right
[36:20] then speak Joshua to the Lord in the day
[36:23] when the Lord delivered up the amorites
[36:25] before the children of Israel
[36:27] and he said in the sight of Israel
[36:29] Sons stand thou steal over upon gibeon
[36:33] and thou moon in the valley of agilon
[36:36] and the son stood still into Moon stayed
[36:39] until the people had Avenged themselves
[36:41] upon their enemies is not just written
[36:44] in the book of jasher so the son stood
[36:47] still in the midst of heaven and hasted
[36:49] not to go down about a whole day
[36:53] there was no day like now get this point
[36:56] and there was no day like that day
[36:58] before it or after it that the Lord
[37:01] hearkened unto the voice of a man
[37:06] for the Lord
[37:08] fought for Israel now let's go over to
[37:10] Hebrews
[37:12] very familiar everybody knows it all
[37:14] right
[37:15] God who at sundered times in diverse
[37:18] manners spake
[37:19] in times past in the fathers by the
[37:22] prophets so you know what's the prophet
[37:24] of God said he's fake in the prophets
[37:26] that word by should have been translated
[37:28] in but it's fine because it's okay
[37:30] all right and half in these last days
[37:33] spoken unto us by his son whom he hath
[37:35] appointed heir of all things but whom
[37:37] also he made the worlds amen you may be
[37:41] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[37:43] reading of the word
[37:45] now
[37:47] you know mankind says they can't trust
[37:49] the Bible
[37:51] because it was written by man
[37:55] well you know that's right in a degree
[37:57] of pinning it speaking it
[38:02] you know bringing it to us
[38:04] those things are true
[38:06] but
[38:08] we read in the Bible that God LED those
[38:10] men
[38:12] see
[38:13] all right so now don't misunderstand me
[38:15] when we get on over into the message in
[38:17] a minute of anything you'd think I'm
[38:19] trying to say I say what I mean and I
[38:21] mean what to say it's whether it's good
[38:23] or bad that's the way I am I just say
[38:25] what I mean so don't try to figure out
[38:27] what I'm talking about just listen
[38:30] and see
[38:32] we know that the Bible then was brought
[38:36] to us by Prophets
[38:40] man brought the Bible to us
[38:42] God used that man
[38:44] all right now it was at one time there
[38:47] even with Moses you should remember that
[38:49] uh God wanted to speak to all of Israel
[38:53] but they chose
[38:55] for a man to speak to him all right so
[38:59] then God said okay that's the way I'll
[39:01] do it
[39:01] I'll do it through man I'll bring it to
[39:03] you you know and see then we are the
[39:06] ones that chose it you say I wasn't back
[39:08] there to do that but we were because
[39:10] we're human all right and when they
[39:14] chose that that put us in a category
[39:17] to where we must believe what man says
[39:20] now if the man's wrong and it proves to
[39:23] be wrong then we don't believe him right
[39:25] I mean sensible
[39:27] if it's something out of the Bible it's
[39:29] not right there's doctrines trinities
[39:31] Etc that we're taught by man that we
[39:33] don't believe
[39:34] but that was days gone by we're supposed
[39:36] to be today the word that we can believe
[39:38] the word of the Lord but if you notice
[39:40] there in verse 14 as I emphasize he said
[39:44] God hearkened
[39:46] to The Voice
[39:48] of a man
[39:50] now
[39:53] you know
[39:54] I believe it this way
[39:56] and uh this is where I've always taught
[39:59] it to my people when brother Jim came
[40:03] out and spoke to us
[40:06] I invited him to come I believe the Lord
[40:08] LED it and all like that and you know I
[40:11] believe that's God's way of speaking
[40:14] right
[40:15] if I hadn't would have called him
[40:17] okay
[40:18] yeah I believe that's the way of God
[40:20] speaking so then there was a ten other
[40:22] guys supposed to come in and preach you
[40:25] know I mean it wouldn't have mattered to
[40:26] me and you know if if brother Jim was
[40:29] scheduled to preach and and and uh Obama
[40:32] wanted to come I I said sorry
[40:35] I got a speaker schedule
[40:38] you know I don't care about what you
[40:40] believe or whatever but I got somebody
[40:42] schedule because I believe that's God's
[40:43] way of speaking it's through man
[40:46] to us right now that's my whole points
[40:48] right now
[40:51] remember
[40:53] and we're going to get some scriptures
[40:54] in a minute to bring out something I
[40:56] have a odd way of approaching something
[40:58] so follow the approach and at a while I
[41:01] say okay now you're ready here's what I
[41:03] got to say okay all right
[41:06] now
[41:07] even in the writing of the Bible
[41:11] I'm believing because some of these
[41:12] notes I I had to write myself getting
[41:15] here and changed a few things but
[41:19] I believe it's in the second seal that
[41:21] brother random said that
[41:26] God gave to Moses a thought
[41:29] he said first it was God's thought
[41:32] he said he gave it to Moses as a thought
[41:36] he said it was not the word
[41:39] he said but then when Moses spoke it
[41:42] it was the word so you understand now
[41:45] the word was written before the world
[41:46] and coming down that's the point that
[41:49] the prophet received the thought
[41:51] what how did um
[41:53] how did Abraham say
[41:55] why did he say I'll give you a tenth
[41:58] of this form
[42:01] I mean what was that number off the top
[42:03] of his head
[42:04] well then we pay a 10 percent tithe
[42:06] don't we
[42:08] I mean see that would fit together that
[42:10] God before the world transmitted down
[42:12] through the the to Abraham and he just
[42:15] didn't pick up a number and say well
[42:17] I'll give you 10 percent right you were
[42:18] to give him 90. right now right but see
[42:22] but when it was finished it's in God's
[42:25] word then it all fits all the way
[42:28] through and then you'll see that it's
[42:30] been God the whole time leading the
[42:33] writing of the Bible that's my whole
[42:34] point all right so then it was not the
[42:37] word until Moses spoke it out right
[42:40] then it became words unto us all right
[42:44] now what about that man
[42:47] no
[42:48] that walked out there one day and he
[42:50] said I know he done it through through
[42:51] Aaron but
[42:53] he went out there and he said let there
[42:55] be flies
[42:58] and they came
[43:00] Let There Be fleas frogs Etc it came
[43:03] right
[43:05] by the words of a man
[43:07] the Bible said that he plagued Egypt
[43:11] with his word
[43:13] actually through Moses he plagued Egypt
[43:17] with the words from a man
[43:19] right now that's that's the point I want
[43:21] you to look at
[43:22] and let's turn over now to another
[43:23] scripture and pick it up look at Exodus
[43:28] 32.
[43:29] all right
[43:31] Exodus 32.
[43:33] we'll begin reading about 30.
[43:38] now I got a Sly way of sliding things in
[43:43] I say that to where you'll remember what
[43:45] I get when I get back to it after a
[43:47] while and I'll put my point in and then
[43:50] I want you to catch it
[43:52] and if you don't catch it I'll come back
[43:54] and tell you what it is
[43:56] me but then you can look on people's
[43:58] faces and they go
[44:00] see they're getting the point okay I'm
[44:03] carnal enough but that's just me forgive
[44:05] me
[44:06] but look look what he says in verse now
[44:10] 30 of Exodus 32. and he came to pass on
[44:14] tomorrow that Moses said unto the people
[44:16] now you know what this was with the
[44:17] golden calf situation and all of that
[44:19] you know
[44:20] look what he said he said unto people
[44:23] you have sinned the great sin
[44:24] and now I will go up unto the Lord free
[44:28] adventure I shall make an atonement for
[44:30] your sin
[44:31] I remember that
[44:33] Moses making atonement
[44:36] Moses returned unto the Lord
[44:40] and said oh this people have sinned to
[44:43] Great sin and have made them gods of
[44:46] gold
[44:47] yet now
[44:49] if thou will not forgive them their sin
[44:52] if not block me I pray thee out of thy
[44:55] book which thou has written
[44:58] we know what happened
[45:00] God told Moses said okay
[45:05] I won't kill him
[45:07] he said I'll deal with them
[45:09] and he did
[45:10] he said they won't go into the land
[45:13] but they'll go up to it
[45:15] they'll get around it
[45:16] they won't be able to go in
[45:18] but he said now I'm going to spar him
[45:21] now now I know so many thousand died
[45:23] that day but the biggest portion of
[45:25] Israel out of some 2 million they went
[45:28] right on their Journey
[45:29] going on towards the Promised Land all
[45:32] right now
[45:34] we know what brother Branham has said
[45:36] about this of reading the scripture you
[45:38] know block my name out
[45:42] and uh
[45:44] I don't feel on some of these I have to
[45:46] give you all of it because I'm standing
[45:48] before congregation is well taught
[45:50] and you'll know even the quote and we
[45:52] were laughing a while ago about my cut
[45:54] and paste
[45:56] really it's cut and tape
[45:58] all right they laugh at me at home but
[46:00] we get it done
[46:03] now we know that brother Branham said
[46:07] that he even had trouble
[46:10] with the fact that Moses could tell God
[46:13] a better way of doing something
[46:17] you know he said
[46:19] if you blocked him out blocked me out
[46:22] all right so we know that that was not
[46:25] Moses brother Brown said on the message
[46:27] souls in prison paragraph 77 or 1 cent
[46:31] 117.
[46:34] he said that always posed on me how that
[46:36] God could tell Moses Moses could tell
[46:39] God a better way than God had until I
[46:41] found out that it was the spirit of
[46:44] Christ in Moses
[46:46] well now we're back in Hebrews one right
[46:50] that God in the prophets
[46:54] they spoke to man
[46:57] so we're not putting the honor upon the
[46:59] man
[47:01] the honor is going upon the God that was
[47:05] feet which you can't leave the man out
[47:07] of the situation
[47:11] it can't be done it's got to be left
[47:13] that way so he says you know if you're
[47:14] going to do that block my name out
[47:17] all right
[47:18] but now listen to this one
[47:21] this is taking looking away to Jesus
[47:23] which is paragraph 83.
[47:26] the brothers are putting them up and
[47:28] they're real good at that and that's
[47:29] they do it at home I hand them these you
[47:31] know but I didn't hand these so they're
[47:32] they're getting ahead of me okay but
[47:35] look what he said and there was another
[47:36] one that puzzled me
[47:38] that was when Moses paragraph 85
[47:42] could tell God a better way than God
[47:44] knowed how to do anything
[47:46] when Moses said the people will say
[47:52] your God was able to bring you out but
[47:55] not able to keep you and Moses threw
[47:58] himself in the breach
[48:00] then later I found out that Moses that
[48:03] that was Christ in Moses standing for
[48:05] the people now
[48:07] we'll get to it in a minute
[48:09] that's actually quoting numbers
[48:12] 14.
[48:15] all right the one we read was Exodus now
[48:17] we'll get to number 14 in a minute and
[48:19] you'll see but see just don't don't lose
[48:22] the point I tell you that because see
[48:25] that's actually in numbers 14. all right
[48:28] which is another situation that Moses
[48:30] has to do the same thing
[48:32] but this is what I like he said in
[48:34] modern events made clear by prophecy
[48:36] paragraph
[48:37] 57
[48:39] that
[48:41] he's the same yesterday today and
[48:42] forever
[48:44] he said it was Christ in Noah
[48:46] it was Christ in Moses
[48:49] it was Jesus Christ in David
[48:51] it was Jesus Christ and Joseph it's
[48:54] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[48:55] and forever
[48:57] and it's Jesus Christ among his people
[48:59] today
[49:02] doing the same thing that he promised
[49:04] he'd do in that age all right
[49:06] so now
[49:08] we know the story then that the real man
[49:12] is the man
[49:13] God you know himself
[49:15] speaking through a man
[49:18] but he doesn't do anything
[49:21] apart from man
[49:23] okay
[49:24] so now watch the point as we begin to
[49:26] just lay it down just a little bit then
[49:30] even God allows a man brother Branham on
[49:34] The Sixth Seal
[49:35] he said he was out there and God was
[49:38] revealing those things to him and
[49:40] listened to a prophet
[49:42] I don't have this quote but he said
[49:44] God I can't tell them that
[49:51] a man
[49:56] could house sit your connection to the
[49:59] mind of God
[50:02] that he could say is just as Moses would
[50:06] say you blocked him out blocked me out
[50:08] he wasn't playing games
[50:10] his life was on the line
[50:13] right but he knew how to deal because
[50:15] over numbers when we read that in a
[50:17] minute she'll see it a little better he
[50:18] knew how to deal with God
[50:22] and during numbers he says now it will
[50:25] be said Mr quote again
[50:27] that you could bring him out but you
[50:29] couldn't take them in
[50:32] he knew how to deal with it now this may
[50:35] be carnal to you but even Balaam
[50:39] with a prophetic gift
[50:42] he could not curse Israel right because
[50:44] God said you can't do it
[50:47] right but with that gift in the presence
[50:49] of the Eternal God
[50:51] he could back out of there
[50:54] and tell balik I can't curse them
[50:58] but I'll tell you how to get them
[51:00] defeated
[51:01] just get them more about women over with
[51:03] them
[51:05] get them men around them more about
[51:07] women because they were pretty
[51:08] and the Israeli women wasn't too pretty
[51:10] because they're out there living in the
[51:12] deserts and like
[51:13] and you know the story
[51:15] so he goes and they get them there but
[51:17] now I don't lay it all against all
[51:20] things but I just put it all together
[51:21] you know a lot of those Israelite women
[51:23] wanted to look like him more about women
[51:26] that's why you got them bite in their
[51:27] faces and all today you know they still
[51:30] want to be the more about women but just
[51:33] making that point but just think
[51:37] Moses said
[51:41] God
[51:43] they will say
[51:46] you were able to bring them out
[51:49] but not able to take them in
[51:54] you know what Moses what God told Moses
[51:57] turn over to numbers 14.
[51:58] see what he told him
[52:04] and we won't have to read all of it to
[52:06] get down because you got the story then
[52:07] of It Go Just Right Back above in verse
[52:09] 13 14 15. we get down to verse 20.
[52:16] he said pardon I beseech Thee the
[52:19] iniquity of this people according
[52:22] unto the greatness of thy mercy that's
[52:25] just after he's finished telling them
[52:27] they will say you could bring them out
[52:29] but you couldn't take you couldn't get
[52:30] them in
[52:31] so it's going to be against your name
[52:34] and we're going to read a quote in a
[52:35] minute where he brought around and said
[52:36] he promised him
[52:40] so Moses was reminding god of the
[52:42] promise
[52:44] so look what he says
[52:48] and his thou Hast forgiven this people
[52:52] from Egypt up until now
[52:55] you know that works you've been
[52:57] forgiving them you're going down below
[52:59] here in the next verse or two you'll
[53:01] find that they sin 10 times from the
[53:04] time they left
[53:06] the Red Sea or you know left Egypt to
[53:08] Katie's Barney I think 10 times
[53:11] and you know God was ready to take him
[53:13] in
[53:15] you know the sin that kept Israel from
[53:16] going to the promised land the big one
[53:19] Katie sparnia
[53:21] when he didn't believe God's word
[53:23] when he said I give you the land
[53:28] and God says that's it I can look over
[53:30] you here and look over you there and
[53:32] look over you ten times but you ain't
[53:33] going
[53:35] because see they become unbelievers
[53:39] right but look what he says in verse 30
[53:42] verse 9 20. and the Lord say it
[53:46] I have pardoned
[53:49] according to Thy Word
[53:55] and what about the words of a man
[53:58] that he could so go before God
[54:03] get an audience with God
[54:07] he'd know the mind of God and know what
[54:09] he was fixing to do
[54:12] but yet he could turn around
[54:15] and use that gift that was in his life
[54:21] to be able to what would be a word for
[54:23] it I don't have any education but be
[54:26] able to bargain
[54:28] with God
[54:29] or deal with God or whatever words you
[54:32] would use you know he would be able to
[54:34] talk to him in plain language
[54:37] he said now look
[54:39] you blocked their name blocked mine out
[54:43] don't let it be said
[54:46] that you could bring them out because he
[54:48] knew they was out we said you can't take
[54:50] them in
[54:51] because you promised them you'd take
[54:53] them in
[54:54] all right let's see what brother Raymond
[54:56] had to say
[54:58] that's why I like to read what he has to
[54:59] say you know
[55:02] man this is from the message presuming
[55:05] e24
[55:07] you can come on down and watch what he
[55:09] says
[55:11] said he would have killed the whole
[55:12] world he said that was Christ in Moses
[55:14] he would have killed the world and
[55:16] everything but look Christ wrote himself
[55:18] into breach for the whole human race we
[55:21] know that Moses thrown himself into
[55:23] bricks for Israel and he said you made a
[55:26] promise God
[55:27] you made a promise that you'd take them
[55:29] to the land that's right what did Moses
[55:32] do to God
[55:35] listen we're reading what he said what
[55:37] did Moses do to God
[55:40] when looked like God was going to do
[55:43] something contrary
[55:45] he throwed the word in his way
[55:49] now reading right around him he's up
[55:51] behind you here
[55:52] he throwed the word
[55:54] in his way
[55:57] see amen I love that right around it
[56:00] says I feel like shouting
[56:03] just talking about it put the word in
[56:05] the way
[56:07] God can't walk over his own word
[56:10] all right
[56:12] said you promised to do it
[56:14] you said you would take them to the good
[56:16] land that was flowing with milk and
[56:18] honey I've told them what you said
[56:23] listen
[56:24] and here we are
[56:26] we're on your hands
[56:30] see he knew
[56:31] how to deal with God
[56:33] all right
[56:35] look on down to the next one the message
[56:37] on the second seal paragraph 54.
[56:40] right down at the bottom you get all of
[56:41] it coming down to it but
[56:44] and their Moses took the place of Christ
[56:47] then to throw himself in the breach and
[56:49] say don't do it Lord see and of course
[56:51] and of course he after he'd ordained
[56:54] Moses to do this
[56:57] he didn't come over Moses
[57:00] they said right around I'm saying that
[57:01] once you
[57:02] because he was acting like Christ in
[57:05] that time that was Christ in Moses
[57:10] he ordained Moses for the job and he
[57:12] wouldn't come over him
[57:14] then we know he was kind of discontinued
[57:16] with him back there when he smoked a
[57:17] rock
[57:19] right
[57:21] and we know that caused Moses to not get
[57:23] to be able to go to the promised land as
[57:25] a walk-in he was 800 years later coming
[57:28] in the scripture
[57:30] but yet he wasn't able to go
[57:33] but you see he could he could go before
[57:35] God being a prophet that's why I
[57:37] mentioned Balaam Balaam could go before
[57:39] God he could see the Holiness and
[57:41] righteousness of God
[57:42] but he couldn't curse Israel but he
[57:45] could go before him and look at it and
[57:47] he'd say if I can just get them to do
[57:49] something wrong
[57:52] you remember even Balaam was shown the
[57:54] hinder part
[57:56] in other words the worst thing that
[57:58] could be happening in Israel he said I
[58:00] don't see it
[58:02] he couldn't go over it
[58:04] but yet he come out of it with an
[58:06] understanding
[58:07] that's what brother random says you got
[58:09] the lion the ox the man the eagle
[58:11] he said the man is shrewd
[58:16] he uses his mind
[58:19] you see it in the message you see
[58:21] preachers
[58:22] that they don't care what the word says
[58:25] they're using words
[58:27] to get the mind to the people
[58:31] and they can get them on that side and
[58:33] they'll say
[58:35] well the brother is a wonderful brother
[58:40] so yeah but he's off the message but but
[58:42] but he said he believed the prophet
[58:47] some people told my wife years ago this
[58:49] right eye would come in the message
[58:50] about a man named Lowry
[58:53] over in India
[58:54] and she said I darson say anything about
[58:57] him he said because he's God
[59:00] he's preaching he's God my wife she said
[59:03] does he believe right around his message
[59:05] she said well no he said he he he says
[59:08] brother Ryan was wrong you know and
[59:10] change it well I said well I don't give
[59:11] a hoot I can say what I want to do about
[59:13] it
[59:15] you know maybe she didn't use the word
[59:17] hoot that solid language okay but
[59:20] the point she wasn't worried
[59:22] if he was off the message
[59:24] but you see the shrewness of man's mind
[59:27] man's words
[59:30] you can take a man's words and you can
[59:31] twist
[59:34] you I know your pastor he knows the
[59:36] truth about any Doctrine you call a
[59:38] brother round's message
[59:40] and I'll give you a quote from Brother
[59:41] Branham from memory it will sound like
[59:44] it's contrary
[59:46] is that true
[59:49] he said one day he said now you know he
[59:51] was always one true and living God he
[59:53] said one day let's stand and address the
[59:55] third person of the trinity
[59:58] right
[1:00:00] now did he believe in a trinity no that
[1:00:02] was your Trinity
[1:00:03] he was telling me Lester just one you
[1:00:05] want to talk to
[1:00:07] you he didn't believe in it himself
[1:00:10] but see man's words can be twisted
[1:00:14] and make things that's what they do in
[1:00:16] the message they take so much of the
[1:00:17] message and then they twist it
[1:00:21] to where it's just Twisted enough and
[1:00:23] until now they're saying that even Jesus
[1:00:25] done wrong
[1:00:30] um
[1:00:31] great following Joe
[1:00:34] you know
[1:00:35] well I'm just honest now
[1:00:37] if if I follow a Doctrine I don't mind
[1:00:40] telling you I'll follow it
[1:00:41] no problem
[1:00:43] you asked me what I believe I'll tell
[1:00:46] you
[1:00:46] and I won't sugarcoat it either
[1:00:49] I'll tell you up front what I believe
[1:00:51] and then I'll tell you why I don't
[1:00:52] believe
[1:00:53] something else you know
[1:00:56] see because that's just the words of a
[1:00:58] man all right
[1:01:00] but now look
[1:01:01] God has got to keep his promise look at
[1:01:04] the last quote we'll give you sir as we
[1:01:06] would see Jesus paragraph uh E36
[1:01:10] he said if God don't keep his promise
[1:01:13] then it's not God's word
[1:01:17] God couldn't be God make a promise and
[1:01:20] then not keep it
[1:01:22] all right now
[1:01:27] at the words of a man
[1:01:30] God was fire Israel
[1:01:34] at the words of a man
[1:01:37] he would actually say I pardoned
[1:01:41] those people
[1:01:43] now
[1:01:44] without going back and reading it I want
[1:01:46] to just get the whole story now oh
[1:01:49] that's background
[1:01:53] we read the scripture where that in
[1:01:55] Exodus 32.
[1:01:58] and after they had made the golden calf
[1:02:00] and the great sin
[1:02:01] Joshua said I'll go up
[1:02:05] before the Lord
[1:02:08] and said pre-adventure
[1:02:10] I can make an atonement
[1:02:15] well
[1:02:18] we deal with basically don't blot out
[1:02:21] and just blot out that's basically
[1:02:22] you're preaching from that point
[1:02:25] but I want you to think about what is an
[1:02:28] atonement
[1:02:29] it's a covering
[1:02:32] you know a lot of times Moses would tell
[1:02:35] Aaron say take your sense or run among
[1:02:37] the people you know and make an
[1:02:39] atonement
[1:02:41] right there were more atonements than
[1:02:43] just
[1:02:45] a lamb
[1:02:47] or a goat or things and like I said he'd
[1:02:51] tell Aaron said take your sensor run in
[1:02:53] off the fire into the altar get that go
[1:02:56] among the people
[1:02:58] and make an atonement for him make a
[1:03:01] covering Farm
[1:03:04] but I want to ask you a simple question
[1:03:07] this is the whole message
[1:03:09] one nutshell
[1:03:11] what was the offering Moses made
[1:03:15] when he said
[1:03:16] I shall make an atonement
[1:03:22] what was the offering
[1:03:25] it was not far off the altar even though
[1:03:27] Aaron done that and that was
[1:03:30] it was not a ram a gold or a lamb or
[1:03:32] whatever
[1:03:36] what was the atonement
[1:03:44] it was his word
[1:03:48] excuse me
[1:03:50] it was his word
[1:03:54] he reminded god of what he had said
[1:04:00] brother random says you find it in the
[1:04:01] Bible call God on the scene he'll do it
[1:04:06] because he said it and he can't deny his
[1:04:08] word
[1:04:09] Moses never offered any animal
[1:04:12] he never even offered fire from the
[1:04:14] altar
[1:04:19] it was his word
[1:04:23] you blocked him out
[1:04:26] blocked me out
[1:04:29] same thing would be on over in numbers
[1:04:33] when he'd come to that place
[1:04:34] that he began to deal with God
[1:04:38] and say God
[1:04:40] it'll be said that you could bring him
[1:04:42] out but you can't take them in
[1:04:44] so don't let that be said so keep your
[1:04:46] promise
[1:04:48] he reminded God of his word
[1:04:54] think about that
[1:04:57] the words of a man
[1:05:00] now we established that that man
[1:05:02] speaking through Moses was Christ right
[1:05:07] speaking to Joshua was Christ
[1:05:11] but there was a connection to the human
[1:05:12] man
[1:05:15] that you cannot separate
[1:05:19] and I read you the quote or showed it to
[1:05:21] you there we did that he said he chose
[1:05:23] Moses for the job and he would not go
[1:05:25] over him
[1:05:28] oh
[1:05:29] I know I'm carnal the way I speak but
[1:05:31] I'd like to make you think
[1:05:33] if Peter said in Acts 2 repent every one
[1:05:37] of you
[1:05:37] and go off for a ten dollar bill
[1:05:41] that would have been what it was
[1:05:43] and if you got the Holy Ghost you'd have
[1:05:45] done that
[1:05:48] but he wasn't going to do it that way
[1:05:49] why because the mind of Christ was in
[1:05:52] Peter to tell him what to do
[1:05:55] see the mind of Christ come through
[1:05:56] Moses and told
[1:06:00] God a better way of doing something
[1:06:03] the atonement Moses made was his own
[1:06:06] words
[1:06:08] that he took before the man
[1:06:11] so you know what we are building the
[1:06:13] words of a man
[1:06:15] does it said about brother random when
[1:06:16] he was talking on the Sixth Seal he said
[1:06:18] Lord I can't tell them that
[1:06:24] what about I know this is going to be
[1:06:26] short and sweet so I like it
[1:06:31] what about a man that could stand in
[1:06:33] this day
[1:06:35] he said let her be squirrels
[1:06:42] God didn't tell him how to speak that
[1:06:45] he just told him what whatever you have
[1:06:47] indeed I was speaking
[1:06:51] go through the life of brother Branham
[1:06:53] then of the things of the third pool and
[1:06:54] the things are speaking to the uh storms
[1:06:57] out of existence the uh you know the the
[1:07:00] growth that was on his wife the the
[1:07:03] things that he spoke of sister had it
[1:07:05] right
[1:07:06] took the words of a man
[1:07:09] that said I give you your children
[1:07:12] sure I heard years later and they I
[1:07:15] don't know about it they said they'd
[1:07:16] both Beck's lead but
[1:07:18] I don't bother me
[1:07:20] how many times you ever backslid
[1:07:24] huh
[1:07:27] see brother random said it
[1:07:30] now that's not for everybody because
[1:07:31] brother Brown said it
[1:07:33] to the person
[1:07:34] huh but get the point
[1:07:38] what atonement do we need today what do
[1:07:40] we offer
[1:07:42] we don't go get a lamb and crucified
[1:07:46] right
[1:07:50] we've got God's word
[1:07:53] I thought we believed in like Romans 18
[1:07:56] everybody's in there that
[1:07:59] you believe in your heart
[1:08:01] and confess with your mouth
[1:08:03] you'll be saved
[1:08:06] you know what you're doing you're
[1:08:08] reminding God of his word
[1:08:10] right he said if you do that in Acts 2
[1:08:12] you'd be saved
[1:08:13] repent everyone and be baptized in the
[1:08:15] name of Jesus Christ and he shall
[1:08:16] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:18] Promises of you and your children and
[1:08:19] pharah
[1:08:20] you're just reminding God right
[1:08:24] it don't bother God for you to remind
[1:08:26] him what he's saying
[1:08:30] come on how many daddies in here
[1:08:31] especially granddaddies now that's the
[1:08:33] worst part but how many daddies in here
[1:08:35] your kid comes up and say
[1:08:39] daddy you told me
[1:08:42] you know
[1:08:44] that you do that
[1:08:49] well where's humans sometimes we can't
[1:08:50] do it maybe but we should tell them say
[1:08:53] well we can't do it so but you told me
[1:08:54] to do it that's the way my kids always
[1:08:56] done me
[1:08:58] they just come to me and they said daddy
[1:09:00] you told me was going to do this or
[1:09:01] we're going to do it or not
[1:09:02] yeah not a problem
[1:09:05] you know well especially grandkids now
[1:09:08] they're they're in a greater higher
[1:09:10] category and well they can really get to
[1:09:11] you they don't even have to remind you
[1:09:13] of what you're saying
[1:09:15] they just look at you
[1:09:18] and you just go do it come on go to your
[1:09:20] granddaddies and everything else
[1:09:22] but you know
[1:09:24] my whole point is one thing
[1:09:28] a man with the word of God
[1:09:31] did Brother Reynold make this statement
[1:09:34] he said a believer
[1:09:37] with the word of God in his heart
[1:09:40] speaks that by faith
[1:09:43] he said it's deity speaking
[1:09:47] it was Christ in Moses it was Christ in
[1:09:50] Joshua
[1:09:52] it was Christ in brother Branham
[1:09:55] now I don't want to raise our hands
[1:09:57] because I don't do that but how many of
[1:09:59] us needed the grace of marriage and
[1:10:01] divorce
[1:10:06] have you ever noticed wrote a random
[1:10:08] Satan
[1:10:09] I say unto you
[1:10:13] said from what God showed me up on that
[1:10:15] mountain
[1:10:16] you go back and you see Moses had a
[1:10:18] Grace
[1:10:19] you go back and you find out that
[1:10:22] Paul had a Grace
[1:10:26] at the words of a man
[1:10:29] We Stand today
[1:10:32] and the words of a man that came that
[1:10:34] God Vindicated to to be the prophet of
[1:10:37] the hour that's why we don't look for
[1:10:38] another one
[1:10:39] all right
[1:10:41] because it may be great anointings out
[1:10:43] there but they don't have a message
[1:10:48] they don't have a message pointing you
[1:10:50] back to God they have a message pointing
[1:10:52] to their billfold in their own things
[1:10:54] right but
[1:10:57] at the words of a man
[1:11:01] we stand on that every day
[1:11:05] I wasn't dire when brother Brown and
[1:11:07] spoke squirrels was you
[1:11:11] I believe it happened
[1:11:13] why because of the message he preached
[1:11:18] would tell me that can be done
[1:11:21] I wasn't there when Moses crossed the
[1:11:24] Red Sea
[1:11:27] now I know we got the quotes right
[1:11:29] around and say I was back there with you
[1:11:30] know what I'm talking about but you know
[1:11:32] what I'm saying you and I wasn't back
[1:11:34] there physically walk across right
[1:11:37] I believe it happened
[1:11:39] the reason I believe it happened
[1:11:43] is because it's like brother Brandon
[1:11:44] when he was preaching one day and he was
[1:11:46] bringing that out about Joshua you know
[1:11:48] and his son stood still
[1:11:50] and he said I'd love to have
[1:11:53] all afternoon he said or something to
[1:11:55] speak on
[1:11:56] and God Stood Still
[1:12:00] you know son stood still
[1:12:04] and he'd say look at
[1:12:06] um
[1:12:08] the little woman with problems
[1:12:13] and she touched His Garment
[1:12:15] and said to Sons Stood Still
[1:12:19] what about all those places in there
[1:12:22] where that God would step on the scene
[1:12:26] and to prove that he was God what about
[1:12:28] the
[1:12:29] The Prostitute that was brought before
[1:12:31] him
[1:12:33] and they said now the Bible says in
[1:12:36] other words to us the law says
[1:12:38] she's to be stoned what is your judgment
[1:12:44] he couldn't say I forgive her
[1:12:47] that would have been contrary to his own
[1:12:49] word
[1:12:50] so he couldn't do it
[1:12:56] but he knew how to take care of it
[1:12:59] right
[1:13:00] so what'd he do
[1:13:02] he knew under the law if you had two or
[1:13:04] three Witnesses you'd Stone the person
[1:13:05] to death right
[1:13:08] I just got rid of the witnesses
[1:13:12] right
[1:13:14] that's what he done he's got rid of the
[1:13:15] witnesses he just condemned them of what
[1:13:17] they were doing
[1:13:19] they all walked away
[1:13:21] he said who condemned you
[1:13:23] she said I don't have no connection he
[1:13:25] said neither do I go and sin no more
[1:13:30] why
[1:13:31] because I believe
[1:13:33] Jesus was a man yes the flesh
[1:13:39] but in that flesh was almighty God
[1:13:43] not the doctrines that's going today and
[1:13:45] that's all right that's their doctrines
[1:13:46] I gotta as the other day I was down in
[1:13:48] the woods
[1:13:50] and I was reading on anointed once the
[1:13:51] end time
[1:13:52] I don't see a lot of deer but I could do
[1:13:54] a lot of reading now
[1:13:56] but are listening to tapes because I got
[1:13:58] an iPod and I just stick it in I went
[1:14:00] through three tapes sitting there on
[1:14:01] this deer stand you know just listened
[1:14:02] running around my house slept through
[1:14:04] half of them and you know but I was like
[1:14:07] reading on anointing once the end time
[1:14:09] you know and it really struck me
[1:14:12] he said those people can't help it
[1:14:16] don't throw off on somebody that doesn't
[1:14:17] believe like you believe because you
[1:14:19] know what they can't help it
[1:14:22] they've heard the words of a man in the
[1:14:24] wrong direction
[1:14:27] they've listened to man
[1:14:29] Express things
[1:14:31] and they've went after the wrong thing
[1:14:32] but you know that can't help it
[1:14:35] that's not going to save them I'm not
[1:14:37] going to do it but I pray that God will
[1:14:39] be lenient
[1:14:41] you know
[1:14:43] those are wonderful people
[1:14:45] but they're caught by man's ideas
[1:14:49] but my point was what what atonement did
[1:14:53] Moses give
[1:14:55] it was his word
[1:14:57] he reminded God of his word
[1:15:02] marriage and divorce
[1:15:05] brother Reynolds spoke to us
[1:15:08] and he said I say
[1:15:12] well you know what
[1:15:14] you may not need the natural Grace of
[1:15:17] marriage and divorce
[1:15:20] but there's not a person in the world
[1:15:21] that didn't need the spiritual Grace
[1:15:25] May differ with me on that that's all
[1:15:27] right but
[1:15:28] even brother Brown I'm carried a Baptist
[1:15:30] Bible and converted them to a Baptist
[1:15:32] faith
[1:15:33] that's what he said
[1:15:36] we all need the grace of marriage and
[1:15:38] divorce have you ever thanked God have
[1:15:40] you ever repented for being in the
[1:15:42] denomination sometime
[1:15:44] you ever done that
[1:15:47] no the Holy Ghost let me out okay okay
[1:15:49] have you ever thanked him for leading
[1:15:50] you out
[1:15:53] have you ever just said Lord
[1:15:56] I was sincere there and I was I was 23
[1:16:00] years old I was an ordained deacon
[1:16:02] when I left the church
[1:16:04] I was teaching the adult Sunday school
[1:16:06] times the deacons and Elders that's what
[1:16:08] I was doing
[1:16:09] when I left
[1:16:10] they thought the world of me
[1:16:13] what you see
[1:16:15] when this message came
[1:16:17] I couldn't do nothing but move I could
[1:16:20] have been told them in the church I got
[1:16:21] them told everybody I said I'm sorry I
[1:16:23] can't stay here
[1:16:25] I've got to move on
[1:16:28] yeah my brother came out and he said any
[1:16:29] minute he said what are you going to do
[1:16:31] I said I don't know he said are you a
[1:16:33] preacher I said Heaven Help I certainly
[1:16:35] don't know about that
[1:16:37] and he said well just stay and we'll
[1:16:39] build you a church and he meant it
[1:16:42] he said we'll build your church
[1:16:46] in my family would fill this church up
[1:16:49] my family
[1:16:51] would fill it up all right because I'm
[1:16:54] the baby of 13.
[1:16:57] four died real early but nine lived on
[1:16:59] got a big family
[1:17:01] all right but my point of what I'm
[1:17:03] saying
[1:17:04] I couldn't help it
[1:17:08] couldn't help it
[1:17:10] a friend of mine was speaking there not
[1:17:12] too long ago in the church where we used
[1:17:14] to go
[1:17:15] and I went to hear him
[1:17:19] not a problem
[1:17:22] I don't figure I've actually it because
[1:17:24] I went back there
[1:17:25] I went to hear the man and encouraged
[1:17:28] him you know young kid coming to
[1:17:31] but you see the point of what I'm trying
[1:17:33] to get
[1:17:35] whether you like it or not you can say
[1:17:37] oh it's a holy ghost it's this
[1:17:40] you're you're built on the words of a
[1:17:42] man
[1:17:44] whether it be that or whether it be the
[1:17:46] quotes of the prophet
[1:17:51] and I sure like the atonement
[1:17:53] that the prophet made I may not have
[1:17:56] needed the natural
[1:17:59] but I surely needed the spiritual
[1:18:01] I made this statement I said Lord you've
[1:18:04] got me out of the Baptist now get the
[1:18:06] Baptist out of me
[1:18:08] you ever done that just say thank you
[1:18:10] Lord
[1:18:12] thank you for saving me there's not a
[1:18:13] day passes that I don't pray Lord thank
[1:18:16] you for saving me
[1:18:19] thank you for delivering me
[1:18:22] thank you for bringing me into the word
[1:18:26] at the words of a man
[1:18:31] stood one day in a church
[1:18:34] told him I said Wade
[1:18:37] is actually it
[1:18:40] but he will come back
[1:18:45] I said leave what you want to the Lord
[1:18:47] told me
[1:18:50] don't know why something one day I said
[1:18:52] that'll take place or I'll quit
[1:18:53] preaching she said well you just
[1:18:54] preached tonight's sermon she was honest
[1:18:59] she said you just preached your last
[1:19:01] sermon
[1:19:02] I said well okay
[1:19:04] what you want to happen
[1:19:06] but I'm just getting a point
[1:19:10] not coming to my wife I have to wait
[1:19:12] come back to the Lord before he came
[1:19:14] back
[1:19:15] I come to wife I said now this
[1:19:19] a little more been added to the story do
[1:19:22] you know okay
[1:19:23] I said he's not only going to be coming
[1:19:25] back to the Lord
[1:19:27] but he's going to be preaching with me
[1:19:31] she said well okay you know well he's
[1:19:35] preaching with me
[1:19:37] my point is this we think
[1:19:40] that the word comes to the prophet now
[1:19:42] we know that I've established that
[1:19:43] established who it is it's Christ and
[1:19:45] what's taking place right all right so
[1:19:47] you shouldn't have any open part or any
[1:19:49] problem with these statements
[1:19:52] but brother random one we read one of
[1:19:53] those he said and he's still the same
[1:19:55] yesterday today and forever
[1:19:57] you know he's still using men to speak
[1:20:00] to us he's using a five-fold Ministry
[1:20:03] the Bible does not say that the prophet
[1:20:05] was made for the perfecting of the
[1:20:07] Saints it says the fivefold ministry but
[1:20:10] now if that Pro if that fivefold
[1:20:12] Ministry Don't Preach what that Prophet
[1:20:13] said they're not a faithful Ministry
[1:20:15] forget it you know it read around and
[1:20:16] said to five full Ministries
[1:20:17] predestinated eternally
[1:20:20] he said but the nine spiritual gifts in
[1:20:22] the church is not
[1:20:25] give some callers without repentance but
[1:20:27] he said five four minutes because really
[1:20:28] see that's God
[1:20:30] we're building the words of a man
[1:20:33] you know that sometimes brother
[1:20:35] Jim has to
[1:20:37] say something that probably if a lot of
[1:20:40] you heard it you wouldn't agree with him
[1:20:44] you'd probably condemn him
[1:20:49] but
[1:20:51] sometimes we ministers have to say
[1:20:52] things
[1:20:56] sometimes we have to speak things
[1:21:00] well I don't believe that brother
[1:21:01] Brandon was the only one that could
[1:21:02] speak the word
[1:21:04] I believe he come to bring a bride to
[1:21:06] the position they could speak the word
[1:21:10] well why can't you speak it for your
[1:21:11] family you've got a child you got loved
[1:21:13] ones you've got a husband or a wife or
[1:21:15] whatever to speak the word for them
[1:21:18] and say it
[1:21:20] and keep saying it till it comes to pies
[1:21:23] because if you say it for a while and
[1:21:24] then say well I really don't know so you
[1:21:26] never did have it right to start with it
[1:21:27] wasn't God
[1:21:28] but if you keep speaking it and it'll
[1:21:30] finally come to pie should be God that's
[1:21:32] the way I believe God I still believe
[1:21:33] that he's speaking through a faithful
[1:21:34] Ministry
[1:21:36] for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:21:42] see the words of a man
[1:21:44] and you know sisters
[1:21:47] now we don't believe in women preachers
[1:21:49] right
[1:21:50] okay
[1:21:51] my brother Ryan said you got your own
[1:21:53] Pulpit at home
[1:21:54] with your children
[1:21:57] and see it's not just the words of a
[1:21:59] m-a-n masculine you know
[1:22:02] that's why I read that in Hebrews
[1:22:06] he says what
[1:22:08] in this day he has spoken unto us
[1:22:10] through his son
[1:22:15] so what's the sun in you that's the way
[1:22:16] women preachers you know they'll say it
[1:22:18] a lot of times they say well I've got
[1:22:19] god in me I've got a man in me why can't
[1:22:20] I preach well we know that's not correct
[1:22:22] but you do have God in you
[1:22:26] preach to your Pulpit at home
[1:22:30] you claim your children this is not just
[1:22:32] made for a man to have to speak it well
[1:22:34] I wait a brother Jim speaks it
[1:22:36] which Revival was it was started and
[1:22:40] they checked back to find out that it
[1:22:41] was the lady that cleaned the church and
[1:22:43] she would just doing the pews you know
[1:22:45] and she just cleaning it and she'd say
[1:22:47] there's brother sets here Lord blessed
[1:22:48] and sister sets here and calls a Revival
[1:22:52] to come into church
[1:22:56] the words of a man
[1:23:00] and you know what now I'm going to end
[1:23:02] it by saying this to make you understand
[1:23:06] it was Christ in Moses you agree
[1:23:09] Christ in David Joshua et cetera Etc
[1:23:14] but now if I cross a Doctrine I'm sorry
[1:23:16] I'm just I say just this way
[1:23:19] none of those in the Old Testament had
[1:23:21] eternal life by the new birth
[1:23:25] right
[1:23:26] there was no new birth because the Bible
[1:23:28] said Jesus had not been glorified he's
[1:23:30] in the Holy Ghost couldn't come until
[1:23:31] Jesus came and released that life to
[1:23:33] come back to give us a new birth that's
[1:23:35] why you got an Old Testament in the New
[1:23:36] Testament okay simple
[1:23:39] now fell under the blood of boys and
[1:23:41] ghosts listen to Bread around them
[1:23:43] if they could speak flies fleas and
[1:23:45] frogs
[1:23:48] he said why would you stumble at
[1:23:51] squirrels under the blood of Jesus
[1:23:53] Christ
[1:23:55] so I believe he spoke to them squirrels
[1:23:56] into existence
[1:24:00] I believe he come to bring me the word
[1:24:04] this is my Bible it was give to me but
[1:24:07] this is my Bible don't belong to you
[1:24:10] this is my Bible
[1:24:13] this is my message you know holding up
[1:24:15] brother randoms quotes
[1:24:18] I can't say it belongs to you
[1:24:21] because it's mine
[1:24:24] there's just one God and he's mine
[1:24:27] well see you've got to say that man
[1:24:30] there's just one God and he's mine
[1:24:33] because see you don't know whether I
[1:24:34] have God or not
[1:24:38] at the words of a man
[1:24:42] we put our whole life
[1:24:46] I mean what if he came along now they've
[1:24:48] tried to do it you know they tried to
[1:24:49] prove that brother Branham was an
[1:24:51] illegally hunting out there in Arizona
[1:24:54] did that stumble you
[1:24:58] know what if they come up now and they
[1:25:00] put out a doctor and then put pictures
[1:25:01] up and showed brother Brandonwood and he
[1:25:04] was standing there and he had 14 women
[1:25:05] lined up down through there
[1:25:08] and said all of them was his wives
[1:25:12] what would you do
[1:25:16] see when dinosaurs said and all that
[1:25:18] came well sure that we know that's right
[1:25:19] which they couldn't be
[1:25:22] but even if it was
[1:25:24] he brought me
[1:25:27] to an understanding of God's word
[1:25:30] I would Glory no matter what anybody
[1:25:33] would say
[1:25:34] about him our glory in the word that
[1:25:37] he's brought me
[1:25:40] the words of a man
[1:25:43] that we stand up
[1:25:46] what do you think about it
[1:25:50] you got to depend on somebody
[1:25:53] brother here's probably the oldest what
[1:25:54] are you about 65.
[1:26:00] you know what he got depend on somebody
[1:26:05] right
[1:26:07] that was the old riddle of the springs
[1:26:09] how many of you in the school level
[1:26:10] talked at and I tell that to people they
[1:26:12] say where'd you go to school the old red
[1:26:14] leather stinks
[1:26:16] what starts off and you know four legs
[1:26:19] lend it with two legs and one to the end
[1:26:22] on three
[1:26:23] and you had to solve the riddle
[1:26:26] this man he starts off crawling
[1:26:29] four legs
[1:26:30] he stands walking up end of it he's got
[1:26:32] a walking stick
[1:26:33] he's got three legs that solved a riddle
[1:26:36] it was called a riddle of the stinks
[1:26:39] you see Church
[1:26:42] we're dependent upon what somebody says
[1:26:45] pray for your pastor
[1:26:49] because now if you're going to stay here
[1:26:50] and he's going to be your pastor
[1:26:53] he's your link
[1:26:55] to God
[1:26:57] no bless God I depend on all right see
[1:26:59] you're not in the you're not in the
[1:27:01] field I'm talking about if you're going
[1:27:02] to say bless God I've got my own Holy
[1:27:04] Ghost and it'll lead me and I ain't
[1:27:06] dependent on nobody we'll go home
[1:27:10] you're a hindrance that's what I tell
[1:27:12] them at church don't come if you're
[1:27:14] going to have a Doctrine like that
[1:27:15] you're hinders to me and I'm a hinders
[1:27:17] to you
[1:27:19] but we move on with God yes
[1:27:22] and we depend upon
[1:27:24] the fivefold ministry
[1:27:27] for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:27:31] because they're predestinated
[1:27:33] to that gift
[1:27:35] brother Jim has one gift I have another
[1:27:37] because Tommy has another
[1:27:39] we're not all the same
[1:27:43] I wish I could have a gift that these
[1:27:45] brothers had or remembered names I
[1:27:46] finally got to remember Tommy
[1:27:50] I heard it ten times last night I said
[1:27:51] one of these days I'll remember that
[1:27:57] see that's why I love the Lord because
[1:27:59] he's that man
[1:28:01] that's leading all of us
[1:28:04] and all of our honor and Glory goes to
[1:28:05] him come on with you
[1:28:07] the man Christ Jesus
[1:28:12] it was back there
[1:28:14] who could speak now he's here and can
[1:28:18] speak through you
[1:28:21] wonderful day isn't it amen
[1:28:27] praise the Lord
[1:28:29] the only thing wrong with that it was
[1:28:31] too short
[1:28:35] but I got enough to finish it up
[1:28:38] I'm just kidding
[1:28:40] now the Lord has spoken this morning and
[1:28:43] uh
[1:28:44] it's not the amount of words that's
[1:28:47] spoken it's the value of that which is
[1:28:49] spoken and what we receive like
[1:28:51] the naturopathic doctors will tell you
[1:28:53] it's not actually how many vitamins you
[1:28:55] take it's what you can metabolize
[1:28:57] it's not how many books you read or how
[1:29:00] many tapes you hear I mean those things
[1:29:02] are good but
[1:29:04] there's not necessarily more grace
[1:29:05] that's ministered because of that but
[1:29:07] it's how much you retain it's how much
[1:29:09] you
[1:29:10] that actually you metabolize spiritually
[1:29:12] that causes a causes growth
[1:29:16] amen and that's what the word is to do
[1:29:18] we're not going to measure it physically
[1:29:19] you know day in day out day in Day Out
[1:29:23] but we know now that there's a restored
[1:29:25] Eden that's begun and we've been invited
[1:29:27] back into the Garden of Eden to eat from
[1:29:29] the Tree of Life we know there's a
[1:29:31] change taking place what Adam failed to
[1:29:33] get now the bride in this hour
[1:29:35] absolutely sidesteps the grave cheats
[1:29:37] death
[1:29:38] and continues to eat word upon word upon
[1:29:41] word upon word and it'll change us into
[1:29:43] his glorious image
[1:29:45] I believe it was David that asked the
[1:29:47] question in Psalms chapter 8 and verse
[1:29:49] 4.
[1:29:50] he said uh
[1:29:52] he said when I consider the stars and
[1:29:54] the heavens I can just picture David
[1:29:56] just gazing out
[1:29:58] under uh
[1:30:00] under a Starlet night and he said Lord
[1:30:02] what is man that thou art mindful of him
[1:30:05] what is man what is man what's his value
[1:30:07] what's his worth
[1:30:09] well our brother helped us to understand
[1:30:12] David's Dilemma not necessarily a
[1:30:14] dilemma but he's asking the question
[1:30:16] man brother the Bible says God's age and
[1:30:18] he said he could have chose the trees to
[1:30:20] preach that would have been a sight
[1:30:21] wouldn't it
[1:30:22] we could be if God had chose a tree we
[1:30:24] could have been sitting out on an L
[1:30:25] train today
[1:30:27] or either brought to yam Tree in here
[1:30:28] whatever but we would be adjusted to it
[1:30:30] if that's what God's I mean that's God
[1:30:32] calls us to believe some of the
[1:30:34] strangest things sometimes but that's
[1:30:36] what separates us from from everybody
[1:30:38] else
[1:30:40] but David said and I like his answer
[1:30:42] here when the Lord apparently responded
[1:30:44] back he says thou has made him a little
[1:30:46] lower than the Angels his crowned him
[1:30:47] with Glory and Honor hence made him to
[1:30:49] have dominion over the works of thy
[1:30:51] hands and has put all things under his
[1:30:52] feet now what he told us in Genesis gave
[1:30:55] us dominion over everything all the
[1:30:57] sheep and The Oxen and all the beasts of
[1:30:59] the field the foul of the air the fish
[1:31:00] of the sea whatsoever passes through the
[1:31:01] past of the sea O Lord Our God how
[1:31:04] excellent is thy name in all the Earth
[1:31:07] David found so many different ways and
[1:31:10] reasons to worship and praise our God
[1:31:12] didn't he there's always something to
[1:31:15] to praise him
[1:31:17] thank God thank God thank God
[1:31:19] I heard a brother was finishing up and I
[1:31:22] normally don't do this well we got a few
[1:31:23] few minutes I normally would just would
[1:31:25] finish but if
[1:31:27] I know if we get out too early you know
[1:31:28] there's kind of a fine line this kind of
[1:31:30] a gray area we get out too early well
[1:31:31] well you know what we gonna do now the
[1:31:33] Baptist already beat us to the buffet so
[1:31:37] but just so just some thoughts I just it
[1:31:40] just just uh
[1:31:42] just take a minute I was listening to
[1:31:44] Terry Fox this morning I knew I wasn't
[1:31:45] having to preach and I was looking at
[1:31:46] the newspaper and listening on Terry Fox
[1:31:47] I remember Terry Fox I know brother
[1:31:49] Chad's a big fan of Terry Fox well if
[1:31:51] you heard what Terry Fox Said Today he
[1:31:53] was talking about election
[1:31:54] procrastination choosing and everything
[1:31:55] he says I submit to you congregations
[1:31:58] that's a Doctrine from the pits of hell
[1:32:00] well Terry just he fell to the bottom of
[1:32:03] my list of preachers
[1:32:06] because he was given an invitation
[1:32:07] whosoever will whosoever will and he
[1:32:11] said all the people say well God elected
[1:32:12] somebody and God chose somebody said
[1:32:13] that's the doctrine from the pit sale
[1:32:15] but you know you just you feel sorry for
[1:32:17] people like that because you have to
[1:32:19] once you deny election Jesus said John
[1:32:21] 15 16 he said you hadn't chosen me I've
[1:32:22] chosen you what are you going to do with
[1:32:23] that I said I'm the one to put your name
[1:32:25] on the last book life for the foundation
[1:32:26] of the world
[1:32:27] I'm thinking if Kane was in his in his
[1:32:29] service I wonder Esau I wonder if he
[1:32:31] could have convinced them that they
[1:32:32] could have been saved
[1:32:34] it had been hard
[1:32:36] it had been hard
[1:32:39] either boy both boys not having done
[1:32:41] good or evil God said I've chosen one
[1:32:43] I've rejected the other I've given Grace
[1:32:45] to one giving grace to the other I say
[1:32:47] this kid it helps me to appreciate
[1:32:49] it helps me to appreciate the love of
[1:32:51] God the word of God and the fact that
[1:32:53] God has chosen a sin as the brother was
[1:32:55] getting getting to in a so many
[1:32:56] directions you go now brother Banner
[1:32:58] made the statement he said he's talking
[1:32:59] about questions and answers 1964. he
[1:33:02] said uh he said you know the king and
[1:33:04] the queen how the queen will serve the
[1:33:05] king he said no wife will serve the
[1:33:07] husband by ministering him food and he
[1:33:09] said now that's the relationship we
[1:33:10] enter into now in this hour where the
[1:33:13] Queen of Heaven the bride ministers that
[1:33:15] food to her husband
[1:33:16] we got to take that word that we hear
[1:33:18] from man we take it right back to the
[1:33:19] word we find it's right it's wrong like
[1:33:22] you said examine it and so forth examine
[1:33:24] these things that we hear it if it's
[1:33:26] right we adopt it as a part of our own
[1:33:28] uh spiritual growth and we believe it
[1:33:31] and we testify it and we confess it and
[1:33:33] so forth and Minister it back to God
[1:33:35] Jesus is the one that said in Matthew
[1:33:38] chapter 18 and verse 18 He said uh how
[1:33:42] did he said he said uh whatsoever you
[1:33:45] bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven
[1:33:48] he said whatsoever you loose on Earth
[1:33:51] I'll loose in heaven he's pointing back
[1:33:52] to the man now because David said what
[1:33:54] is man it's a man who's actually crowned
[1:33:57] with honoring Glory from God so God
[1:33:59] deposits that word in his heart to what
[1:34:01] to speak it out David said I have seen
[1:34:03] therefore I have spoken
[1:34:05] see I've heard but now I see and what's
[1:34:08] the last part of that now I speak that
[1:34:10] back out and that's why we're called to
[1:34:11] be Witnesses and we testify of what God
[1:34:13] has done and that's how the word gets
[1:34:15] from generation to generation to
[1:34:16] generation to generation God established
[1:34:18] that all through the law teach it to
[1:34:20] your children and your children's
[1:34:21] children your children's children and
[1:34:22] and right on down and write on down and
[1:34:24] that's why we have it
[1:34:26] in such volume today and such Clarity
[1:34:28] today because it's continued to be to be
[1:34:31] preached
[1:34:32] bride ministering the word the husband
[1:34:34] said oh I said something in it just come
[1:34:36] fresh you said something he said but you
[1:34:38] didn't get it but there's going to
[1:34:40] people they'll be people rise up and
[1:34:42] they'll absolutely get it thinking of
[1:34:44] another statement he made on page 50 of
[1:34:46] souls in prison he said with the word
[1:34:48] comes to the prophet we know that God's
[1:34:50] ordained it he says but now
[1:34:52] now that last prophet is off the scene
[1:34:54] he said now the word comes to the
[1:34:55] individual to the bride the elect and he
[1:34:58] said they become now the word to the
[1:35:00] people
[1:35:01] yeah God's entrusting his word in human
[1:35:04] vessels in Earthen vessels where the
[1:35:07] will of God is he prayed not my will but
[1:35:10] thine be done he told us he taught us to
[1:35:12] pray in Luke 11 he said he said our
[1:35:15] father would start in heaven Hallowed be
[1:35:16] thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[1:35:17] done in earth in Earth and vessels
[1:35:21] this is where God this is the final
[1:35:22] resting place of God's word
[1:35:24] is to develop us into the very image of
[1:35:27] God himself we become living Epistles
[1:35:30] written Epistles known in red of all men
[1:35:33] amen that's a good word today I enjoyed
[1:35:36] that
[1:35:36] I enjoyed that I'll be munching on that
[1:35:38] for a while
[1:35:40] we're sheep we're of the ruminant family
[1:35:42] I mean knows what a rumored it is you
[1:35:44] see a chief always room they always
[1:35:45] ruminating
[1:35:47] or they got four stomachs see they just
[1:35:49] they eat it down it comes back up he
[1:35:51] down comes back up it's a type of
[1:35:52] meditation
[1:35:53] meditate on these things David said day
[1:35:55] and night when you get up communion with
[1:35:57] your heart meditate on these things and
[1:35:59] there's where it becomes strength
[1:36:00] because you get into that fourth stomach
[1:36:02] which is called the album you get into
[1:36:04] that fourth stomach and that's where it
[1:36:05] becomes meat actually to them not here
[1:36:08] just hearing it in the first realm and
[1:36:09] so forth and just kind of processing in
[1:36:12] our mind
[1:36:13] but when we meditate on those things
[1:36:14] meditate on those things meditate on
[1:36:16] those things that's because that's where
[1:36:17] it becomes reality that's where it
[1:36:18] becomes life
[1:36:19] to us amen
[1:36:21] whosoever sends you retain remember as
[1:36:23] Jesus blessed them and so forth at
[1:36:25] Bethany
[1:36:26] and what he tell him he said whosoever
[1:36:27] sins you retain he said they'll be
[1:36:30] retained and whoever sins you remit you
[1:36:32] remit talking to people said and also he
[1:36:34] said whatsoever if any two of you will
[1:36:37] agree or touch two or three will agree
[1:36:38] is touch anything on Earth that they
[1:36:40] shall ask he said it shall be done they
[1:36:42] that you ask shall be done of my
[1:36:44] heavenly father
[1:36:46] amen God entrusts man to deliver his
[1:36:50] word to receive his word and to preach
[1:36:53] his word to believe his word and that's
[1:36:54] what's going to change his friend that's
[1:36:56] God's order that's God's contract that's
[1:36:59] God's covenant with us today I'm so
[1:37:01] happy about that aren't you praise the
