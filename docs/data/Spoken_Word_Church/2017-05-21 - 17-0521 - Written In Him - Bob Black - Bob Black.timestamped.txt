[0:00] so far yeah right holy hallelujah look
[0:07] there's a sign cool no no I'm just I'm
[0:11] just winging it this morning is a lady
[0:15] sorry mr. Peter one all right go ahead
[0:20] look I'll just go to our house y'all can
[0:22] they read longer look separately i'ma
[0:28] read if you want to turn into the luge a
[0:30] 13 and verse ATP but most of our brains
[0:35] are bobbing the operated on this thing
[0:37] that's alright just listen to me when I
[0:40] read it okay one two three versus four
[0:43] location Luke chapter 10 verse 18 and it
[0:50] says and he said of the deal platter and
[0:56] you said in the bill I'll be healed
[1:00] sickness ladies fall from heaven behold
[1:03] I give unto you power to tread on
[1:05] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[1:07] power of the enemy and nothing shall by
[1:10] any means hurt you notwithstanding this
[1:13] rejoice not that the spirits are subject
[1:15] unto you but rather rejoice because your
[1:17] names are written in heaven you know
[1:21] okay somebody would mention it lately as
[1:24] they repented preaching or teaching from
[1:26] school I'll give you the world but you
[1:28] just as you as you read scripture and
[1:30] through the course of your life things
[1:32] just it's like a I know brother Wade
[1:34] mentioned many times it's like onion
[1:36] skin it just keeps unfolding and
[1:37] unfolding and the more you talk to the
[1:41] more you read about it the more you see
[1:42] and I think this little scripture some
[1:45] of these little scriptures in Matthew
[1:46] Mark Luke and John and all the ones in
[1:49] the New Testament everything just begin
[1:51] unfolding there's so there's so much
[1:54] media into these little things so maybe
[1:57] this morning I just want to talk about
[1:58] something that's a little bit me a quote
[2:02] I like the coldest
[2:03] Wesley said he said when I was called to
[2:05] preach then I was called to study and I
[2:07] believe every minister is called a study
[2:09] and get into word and get into something
[2:11] so needy things and if anything in this
[2:14] one is a little message seems a little
[2:17] bit a perplexing or whatever then by all
[2:19] means go to go to wake up Dale and ask
[2:22] you about it and see if you like the
[2:25] brains in search description let's see
[2:26] if it's truly what the Bible says this
[2:29] little scripture has some some some real
[2:31] leaders talking about first of all power
[2:33] it's talking about a of power that you
[2:36] know brother Branham talked about the
[2:37] difference between a knowing one and and
[2:40] a real vote again the son of God there's
[2:43] a power that came to these disciple the
[2:45] only difference he said I give you power
[2:48] to tread on the surface at the power
[2:50] over all the enemy power to power to
[2:53] cast out Devils power to particularly
[2:57] preach and do all those things that that
[2:59] forget they weren't born again and you
[3:01] can see that even in their lie in this
[3:04] stage you know Peter would he didn't
[3:06] quite have a grasp of what Jesus purpose
[3:08] was when he said Jesus don't know you're
[3:11] not going down on the cross and
[3:12] everything ain't easy turnaround said
[3:13] get behind me Satan because he was he
[3:17] didn't have a revelation to
[3:18] understanding of what the word looks so
[3:20] there's a power that comes from being
[3:22] annoyed and having a power that comes on
[3:24] your life that just that anointing
[3:26] falling on you but there's a different
[3:28] power that could that comes with the
[3:30] life of Christ himself coming it in
[3:33] telling you the power become sons of God
[3:36] the power of you make in the image of
[3:38] God in the image of who he is you know
[3:40] we talk about the word a lot that's kind
[3:43] of something that we you know we say
[3:45] we're based on the word I wonder
[3:47] sometimes if we really understand what
[3:49] the word means the word is not just the
[3:51] letters on the page the word the word is
[3:54] not just the intellectual understanding
[3:56] of what the word is not just being a
[3:58] repeat like a pair that it's what a
[4:00] preacher says when a word is the rip the
[4:02] word the person of Jesus Christ is the
[4:05] person and that person is who gives you
[4:07] power when that person comes to live
[4:09] that's out of you
[4:11] to make you in the image of what was
[4:14] written before the foundation the world
[4:15] that person is living and that person is
[4:17] give powering you to becoming to the
[4:19] English of your maker that person that
[4:22] that that's does you know the letters of
[4:26] the page really almost they to really
[4:30] give power to the letters on the page
[4:31] something hasn't had to happen at
[4:34] Calvary something something had to
[4:35] happen it devil so filled in Jesus's
[4:38] ministry and what it was was that these
[4:39] words that were on the page had to be
[4:42] put inside a flesh and when that word is
[4:45] on the pages put inside a flesh there
[4:48] becomes the gospel because Paul said I
[4:50] cannot even word old but I came to you
[4:53] in power and the demonstration of the
[4:55] Spirit and much assurance because it's
[4:57] not just letters on a page but it's the
[4:59] power of the gospel is priests power to
[5:02] deliver maminta stre has power to power
[5:06] lay on our hands
[5:07] power to preach the word and that's what
[5:09] the preaching of the gospel is the power
[5:12] and the demonstration because it brings
[5:15] what was written in heaven down into
[5:18] earth down into your flesh and then it
[5:21] can make you is molded into his image so
[5:26] that's it you know you go through all
[5:29] these scriptures talk about something's
[5:30] being written something we're written
[5:32] and that's how I believe now and they
[5:36] say we're coming to a place where we
[5:37] know who what was written and we can
[5:39] identify ourselves in the scripture we
[5:41] can look in the scripture and see the
[5:43] scripture speaking of what's happening
[5:44] to us in this day and not so much
[5:47] anymore what you know we used to look at
[5:49] and we say well I know that God sent a
[5:50] prophet I know that God God he came down
[5:54] and vindicated on top of the pillar of
[5:56] fire but now you know there's something
[5:58] that had to happen between Jesus being
[6:02] manifested on the earth and Jesus taking
[6:04] his kingdom and what that was that it
[6:07] has to one had to be coming to
[6:08] realization in the manifestation was the
[6:10] revelation of a bride the mystery of a
[6:13] bride had to come
[6:14] and that's what's been happening that
[6:16] all through the seven churches that the
[6:18] bride that Gothel have been being
[6:19] preached and the bride is being unfolded
[6:22] and being declared then now that now you
[6:24] begin to look in the scriptures and you
[6:26] can see you can be identified on what
[6:28] the scripture says about you and you can
[6:30] look and say that I know that that God
[6:33] word is being fulfilled in my life and
[6:36] that is the power of the power become
[6:37] sons of God the power of God being made
[6:40] manifest in your life that you are
[6:42] becoming one with the word is that right
[6:46] let's look at God's power to transform
[6:49] just read this to me but you can just
[6:51] listen just listen you other you know
[6:57] whether said it's an old familiar text
[6:59] anything of your pastor says use down
[7:01] through time it's been used as it was
[7:03] written but yet one thing about the Word
[7:05] of God it never grows old because it's
[7:08] God it never grows old through every
[7:10] generation now for pretty near about
[7:12] twenty eight hundred years or better
[7:14] this word of God has been read by man
[7:16] priest as so forth
[7:18] it never does it grow old I've been
[7:20] reading it myself for some 35 years and
[7:22] each time I read it I find something new
[7:24] that I looked over the first time right
[7:27] hey that's a truth but now listen if she
[7:29] said 'no call it is inspired it is God
[7:33] in letter form see it's the attributes
[7:37] of God speaking 4/4 and it's placed on
[7:41] paper now now you think you know the
[7:44] scripture says you when when when Jesus
[7:46] for smoke when God was talking to John
[7:48] he said where were you the sons of God
[7:50] shouted for joy and here he's talking
[7:52] about the attributes of God that what
[7:54] was going God before the foundation of
[7:56] the world now is in letter form and what
[7:58] didn't letter form is speaking out with
[8:00] the attributes of God speaking for from
[8:03] this page being revealed in your life
[8:06] and what will the nationís back there
[8:08] and now being made manifest in you here
[8:11] in flesh on earth what was in heaven is
[8:14] now in earth what was in what was there
[8:17] is now coming to be made matter
[8:18] deserve that's the gospel we say the
[8:21] gospel is just good news the gospel is
[8:24] God becoming making himself manifest in
[8:27] your flesh like like in the Old
[8:29] Testament when they when that pillar of
[8:31] fire came and dwelt the kingdom and move
[8:34] down into the badger skins and in a
[8:37] place in the side of the ark the word
[8:39] that your tables of stone and then when
[8:41] Jesus died on the cross out from his
[8:43] side came water blood and spirit that
[8:47] showing that the corrupt abroad was
[8:49] going to come from inside just like this
[8:50] tables of stone they were written that
[8:52] that that God's Word was inscribed by
[8:55] the finger of God were placed in the
[8:56] side they are by the finger of God and
[9:00] that's how you steal varieties you're
[9:01] writing his word in you to make his word
[9:04] come to pass just for his word in you if
[9:08] you can see if you look at God's working
[9:10] to see yourself identified and that
[9:11] gives you face because you know where
[9:13] you came from and you know where you're
[9:15] going and you know what's taking place
[9:17] right here he'll give you faith Hey in
[9:20] the revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[9:22] faith is the revelation of his name's
[9:25] putting his name the revelation of his
[9:27] name and you and your forehead and
[9:30] putting it and you're sealing him
[9:32] because you know who he is and because
[9:35] you know who he is and his word is
[9:36] opening up to you that you know who you
[9:39] are because you're part of you and that
[9:41] day you shall know that I am and the
[9:42] father you and me and I on you and all
[9:44] those other things because you have a
[9:45] revelation of Jesus Christ and the
[9:47] revelation of Jesus Christ is unfolding
[9:49] you and if God is the book and the book
[9:52] is being unfolded to you then he said
[9:58] look what was the message for what was
[10:00] the message for the message is the
[10:02] revelation of Jesus Christ the message
[10:04] and it was not even said so much program
[10:07] didn't go up it didn't come so much even
[10:09] to tell us to be born again because we
[10:11] already knew that we even know that but
[10:13] listen as Charles Finney and now all of
[10:15] those preachers that preach down to the
[10:17] age that because the way to be born
[10:19] again is never changed it's always been
[10:21] by faith oh that was the very first
[10:23] Sunday School
[10:24] I have a priest with third tallest was
[10:26] that able sacrifice to able sacrifice
[10:29] was dedicated because he he believed God
[10:31] he came in with simple faith to believe
[10:33] and God came down he consumed his
[10:35] offering by fire the same way that you
[10:37] get the new birth wait until God comes
[10:39] down to consider accepts your space
[10:41] accept your faith and human and consumes
[10:44] it with the holy fire and burns out all
[10:46] the dross the whole thing that's not for
[10:47] us to be in there the one that what's
[10:50] the message sit for the message is set
[10:51] to prove to you to show to you that God
[10:54] thought of you before the world before
[10:56] the foundation of the world but that
[10:58] eternal thought in you was something
[11:00] that he's the same yesterday today and
[11:02] forever he's always Hebrews 13:8 he
[11:05] always knew you in his authority always
[11:07] had a plan for you to be come into this
[11:09] world and he were always in the mind of
[11:12] God you already thought when he was
[11:14] going to cross you or his mind when he
[11:16] was he was on that cross thinking about
[11:17] you
[11:18] give it up his life for you and you were
[11:21] only in his mind when using the garden
[11:22] Gethsemane crying out to God Father let
[11:25] this cup pass through me but never less
[11:26] not dying but not not modeling but I be
[11:29] dealing because he was he came to
[11:30] fulfill God's Word which is to bring
[11:32] forth the attributes you know the
[11:35] attributes the record of those
[11:37] attributes is the book of life the
[11:38] record of how they came into being by
[11:41] the word down through the ages the word
[11:43] being born spoken into existence and
[11:47] that's what the message is the message
[11:48] is to showed you that you always were in
[11:51] the mind of God but you bypass the word
[11:53] to come into flesh but now God made a
[11:56] way back through the word he may have
[11:58] way back by the mystery of the gospel he
[12:01] made a way back for you to hear the word
[12:03] and believe it accept it and then become
[12:06] one with the word so by this message by
[12:09] the gospel that we've heard we know
[12:11] where we came from we know who we are
[12:13] and we know where we're going back
[12:15] and now give us reaction face because
[12:18] when the bribe against realized who she
[12:20] is
[12:20] all those other things she'll be able to
[12:23] begin to be able to have a testimony
[12:24] should be able to be able to speak the
[12:27] word because her self is moving away
[12:29] herself
[12:30] she she's back at home and the father's
[12:32] beginning speaking her because she's
[12:34] realizing who she is everything all
[12:44] right yeah just saying that break it up
[12:50] some more what I can let me read this
[12:59] quote I didn't know the resume of the
[13:03] ages program said because I want to get
[13:06] this about the annoying one there's a
[13:07] different you know we shouldn't be we
[13:09] shouldn't be afraid to get in the
[13:11] anointing because we might feel like you
[13:14] might be an anointed one that don't be
[13:16] afraid to get into it because in the
[13:18] church age book refers to get in the
[13:19] spirit and get in the spirit for a
[13:22] revelation he said does it this very
[13:25] moment we in the complete fulfillment of
[13:27] Matthew but it's a much different were
[13:30] possible they shall deceive the very
[13:31] elect and in doing that they shall
[13:34] attempt to deceive the very elect while
[13:36] the spirit of Antichrist in the false
[13:39] anointing one of this last day these
[13:42] false ones have already come in Jesus
[13:44] name claiming that they have been
[13:46] anointed of God for the last day not now
[13:49] I'm a speaker wants to difference we're
[13:51] northern one what's the difference
[13:52] somebody that just on their spirit has
[13:55] an annoying the truth the true holy
[13:57] hosts are known in their flesh so what's
[13:59] the difference between that and a real
[14:00] son of God not one is going to look
[14:03] correct school they're going to be signs
[14:05] and wonders following all those
[14:06] different kind of things it doing things
[14:09] maybe raising the dead even those cast
[14:12] out Devils and all those things but
[14:13] there's a difference between that and
[14:15] the lie that person of Jesus Christ
[14:17] coming and stepping inside of that
[14:19] person and causing them to know the
[14:21] order to understand the word because
[14:23] when you understand the word you're
[14:25] becoming part of the word you're being
[14:27] made in the image of God and that's the
[14:29] difference between the power of an
[14:31] anointed one and the power of the Son of
[14:33] God give you power to these sons of God
[14:35] didn't believe power to be sons of God
[14:38] that gives you power to be made in the
[14:40] image of God that God becoming
[14:43] tabernacle himself inside of you so
[14:46] listen to the rest of this quote they
[14:48] are the false messiahs anointed ones
[14:50] they claim that they are prophets but
[14:52] are they one with the word
[14:54] that's program asking that question
[14:56] never they have added to it or taken
[14:59] from that no one denies that the Spirit
[15:01] of God manifesting a gifts his opponent
[15:03] but like Balaam they all have their
[15:06] programs make their appeal for money
[15:09] exercise gifts but deny the word of
[15:12] bypass it for fear that a controversy
[15:15] might diminish their chances for greater
[15:19] gain see there's another evidence about
[15:22] your motives and objectives is your
[15:24] motive an objective to get United with a
[15:26] word no matter what the cost is your
[15:28] motive an objective to lay down your
[15:30] position in the church your position in
[15:32] the community or whatever other people
[15:33] think about you to die yourself so that
[15:36] you can become one with the word are you
[15:37] interested in your own personal gain
[15:39] your own personal motives it comes down
[15:41] to your personal motives to listen to
[15:44] what he says yet they preach salvation
[15:45] and deliverance through the power of God
[15:48] just like Judas when a ministry imparted
[15:51] by Christ but because they are wrong
[15:53] seed consequently they have a wrong
[15:55] spirit and motivating them of course now
[15:58] a brother who speaks about seed it can
[16:01] be a little bit confusion if you're not
[16:03] in tune with what he's talking about
[16:04] because there was a feedback there
[16:06] before the foundation of the world when
[16:08] that attributes are being made
[16:10] manifested in him and then to be see
[16:12] down
[16:13] you have to receive the word you have to
[16:15] hear the word and that word has to be
[16:16] quicker than you but what that does is
[16:18] it can if that's that same eternal life
[16:20] in you
[16:21] when you hear the word and that comes to
[16:23] life it connects you back there with
[16:24] that eternal see you in heaven and now
[16:27] you can say that elijan me never
[16:29] advocating and there is never a heaven
[16:31] is the karate connected back there
[16:32] without eternal life that eternal sea he
[16:35] said yet they preach so here is it
[16:39] religious oh my they outshine the
[16:43] elected effort and zeal but it is layout
[16:45] of sea and not aprox where it looks for
[16:48] big crowds big programs and startling
[16:51] signs amongst them that preached the
[16:53] second coming of Christ but deny the
[16:55] advent of the Prophet messenger though
[16:57] empowering signs and true revelation he
[17:00] eclipses them all is this false spirit
[17:03] that in the last day is so close to the
[17:05] real can be distinguished only by
[17:09] deviation from the word and that's the
[17:12] only way you could tell because the
[17:14] difference is the sons of God are coming
[17:16] into the image of God where over here
[17:18] you've got somebody that the now the
[17:20] word don't know or don't understand the
[17:21] word because they're just there after
[17:23] their own motives and textures and
[17:25] things and whenever it is calling being
[17:28] anti word it falls back on the one
[17:30] argument we have already shown to be
[17:31] false we get results no we have to be of
[17:36] God that's how it be so close to this
[17:39] last day of of the see the very link if
[17:40] it were possible but in this day I
[17:43] believe the very life is coming to us
[17:45] coming to a pinnacle coming to a whole
[17:46] razor edge where we can identify the two
[17:49] spirits in the framework of the church
[17:51] where we can know what the difference is
[17:53] because the Word of God is sharper than
[17:55] a two-edged sword dividing in terms of
[17:57] the soul of the spirit a piercing even
[17:59] is a matter of only showing one of the
[18:01] difference is what the difference
[18:02] between the northern one and the real
[18:04] true believer will only goes to live
[18:06] with the person of Jesus Christ is down
[18:08] on the inside of their soul and without
[18:10] that sort of the word we wouldn't know
[18:12] the difference between soul spirit and
[18:14] body but we also wouldn't know the
[18:16] difference between anointed and in that
[18:18] alive being on the inside
[18:20] here but I'm getting Cowell away from my
[18:22] topic my topic was written into him
[18:24] written him because if you see that
[18:26] you're written in him and you see that
[18:29] you're written in in God's Word which is
[18:32] God in letter form then that will give
[18:34] you faith right faith is a revelation
[18:37] faith is a revelation of who you was you
[18:40] know I believe that Jesus began as he
[18:42] began to grow older and he began to see
[18:44] you know being in that little child form
[18:48] but it was a place where you know he was
[18:51] just a little baby and he better
[18:53] humanity could cry out and maybe it as
[18:55] his brain develops he began to learn how
[18:57] to other words and things may be running
[19:00] out in the street his model said come
[19:02] back here and obedient to his parents
[19:05] and before long his brain taught to
[19:07] employ his natural brain got to up began
[19:10] to get to a place where maybe like
[19:11] brother Brandon what it is then his Yugi
[19:13] began to see visions of things maybe his
[19:15] father began to speak to him and you
[19:18] know that's a revelation of the God is
[19:20] the father a different person if he's
[19:22] Hebrews 13:8 he's got a question brother
[19:25] I said who is this no kids dead is that
[19:28] no kids that makes somebody different
[19:30] than Jesus is their father somebody hid
[19:33] from the Sun different from the Holy
[19:34] Ghost he's the same yesterday today and
[19:37] forever he's that same person can split
[19:40] God into three different people though
[19:42] then you've got different personalities
[19:43] different people arguing one of these
[19:45] the same person and whatever that person
[19:48] was back there he was in Jesus Christ
[19:50] he's the same person now I've been
[19:51] putting inside of you he's going to act
[19:53] the same way you're going to do the same
[19:54] way that something God led by the Spirit
[19:57] of God he's going to be the same humans
[19:59] the smell kissing it if you if you've
[20:01] got a revelation of who Jesus Christ
[20:03] because you have a real a revelation of
[20:05] who God is in your life and then you
[20:08] have the answer to who live this milk
[20:09] everyday right but but the Jesus you
[20:14] know he began to you know he'd go and
[20:15] after that time that they left him in
[20:18] the his mom and Daddy
[20:21] while election and they couldn't find
[20:24] him and when they found him he said
[20:25] didn't you know I must be about my
[20:26] father's business he was in a temple
[20:28] asking I don't believe he was asking in
[20:30] a way I like he wanted to know the
[20:32] answer he was asking to probe those
[20:34] those priests the Pharisees and it was a
[20:37] probe probe their mind get something
[20:39] started in their mind and say well maybe
[20:41] I don't understand the Scriptures the
[20:43] way I used to go the word was being made
[20:45] manifest and been amiss and he was the
[20:48] word and he looked back in the
[20:51] scriptures and see himself identified
[20:53] with the scripture like the light when
[20:55] he came to the City Guard and said that
[20:59] this day in his scriptures fulfilled in
[21:01] your ear because he was looking back at
[21:03] the things that were promised about him
[21:05] not now faint spirits a little bit you
[21:07] know that when you look in the scripture
[21:09] you should be identified your life
[21:11] should be identifying the same way that
[21:13] Jesus life was identified in the
[21:15] scripture his whole life was was written
[21:18] out promised out of the scripture
[21:20] exactly how he born he would be born in
[21:22] the place that he would be born to try
[21:25] the he will be born from the end of the
[21:27] trial that he'll be preceded by
[21:29] messenger though the way that he spoke
[21:32] that song as I said he was speaking
[21:34] parables how you've been betrayed that
[21:36] about the potter's field that he'll be
[21:38] crucified with criminals that he'll be
[21:40] hated without a calls not a bowl will be
[21:42] broken that he would render it from the
[21:44] dead that he would ascend to heaven and
[21:46] all those things and can look back to
[21:48] the scripture and read about like he'd
[21:50] be pulled that scroll out from our lands
[21:51] that it's written right here is written
[21:53] about me and that's the proof that you
[21:56] have that you're born again that's the
[21:57] proof that you have is you're going to
[21:58] take a raptures when you look back in
[22:00] the scripture and you can identify
[22:01] yourself with what's written here you
[22:04] can see yourself in God's Word and
[22:06] that's how that's how you almost maybe
[22:09] this is a strange way to stand but when
[22:11] you're falling again it's almost when
[22:13] you've heard the message
[22:13] it's almost like you've been introduced
[22:15] to yourself not not myself it being
[22:17] introduced to the eternal Word of God it
[22:20] was predestinated coming to your heart
[22:22] from the foundation of the world that's
[22:23] why yeah you know run else may be said
[22:27] many times that strange statement
[22:28] there'll be a special scripture that's
[22:30] special to you because that may be that
[22:32] scripture that you hung on to when you
[22:34] were born and giving you stuff no matter
[22:35] what the world says I know the
[22:37] description is true and I know that this
[22:39] the Scriptures writing is sprung to life
[22:41] in you and they're from a scripture
[22:43] maybe all the other word begin to open
[22:45] up and just tell you the whole book
[22:47] became a new turbo because you're being
[22:49] introduced to yourself not not that's
[22:52] maybe a strange way of saying it but you
[22:53] begin to look into God's Word and see
[22:55] what was predestinated to come to you
[22:58] eternally and now it's being made
[22:59] manifest in your flesh the eternal
[23:04] writing that's why John and John 14:23
[23:08] 26 jesus said jesus answered and
[23:11] suddenly in the camara love me you will
[23:13] keep my words while he keep my words
[23:15] because the word keeper is in his heart
[23:18] if a man love me and my father will love
[23:22] it was will come unto him and make our
[23:24] abode with him he that loveth me not
[23:26] keeping up my sins in the word which he
[23:28] here is not mine but the fathers were
[23:30] Sydney these things have I spoken and he
[23:33] being at present with you but the
[23:35] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[23:37] the father will send in my name he shall
[23:38] teach you all things and bring all
[23:40] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[23:42] have said unto you what's he bringing to
[23:44] your remembrance what you teaching you
[23:46] he's teaching you what was written
[23:47] before the foundation world what was
[23:49] written in him he's teach you about that
[23:50] eternal life that always was that never
[23:53] had beginning they never had anything at
[23:55] all it always existed when you become a
[23:57] part of God he's showing you those
[24:00] things he's showing you what was written
[24:04] like in John 12 verses 12 to 16 on the
[24:08] next day much people that were coming to
[24:10] the feast when they heard that Jesus was
[24:11] coming to Jerusalem two branches of palm
[24:14] tree and look forth to meet him and cry
[24:16] it was then a blessed
[24:17] can your visual that coming from the
[24:18] name of the Lord and use when he had
[24:21] found a young handset their own as it is
[24:23] written fear not daughter of Zion behold
[24:24] thy King cometh sitting on an axis
[24:27] called coat these things understood not
[24:29] his disciples at the first but when
[24:31] Jesus was glorified then remembered a
[24:34] that these things were written of him
[24:36] they were written of him in the word
[24:38] which is the letter of God the God and
[24:41] letter for that this wasn't written the
[24:43] first time or it might be written first
[24:46] time by piano paper but this was always
[24:49] existed in the mind of God never gone
[24:52] there Adam you thought it was always in
[24:54] him and if Jesus will in these pages if
[24:57] this is God and letter form then and you
[24:59] are part of God then you can look into
[25:02] Gus into the written word and see
[25:03] yourself come off the page problem
[25:10] anymore okay let me skip skip down a
[25:14] little bit
[25:16] well let me let me talk about this so
[25:18] both of Jesus either look at Jesus and
[25:20] see your life compared what he is
[25:22] concealing about the life of a Christian
[25:24] he all the things that he did typed out
[25:26] a Christian he was born by a word only
[25:28] there's between his birth in your birth
[25:29] is an angel a heavenly angel spoke his
[25:32] birth and Mary believed it by your
[25:34] brother
[25:35] earthly angel and he you better be
[25:37] careful speaking against the final
[25:39] mission because you can't hear it
[25:41] without without our earthly angel earth
[25:43] angel has to speak it for you to for you
[25:45] here if you understand it for you to be
[25:47] born again at Earth Lane when you say
[25:48] well well I heard it what on earth lanes
[25:51] will didn't you hear from the prophet
[25:52] then you hear from you kitty
[25:54] you can hear from your friends you say
[25:56] oh I just read in the Bible and hardly
[25:58] angel wrote this and earthly it was a
[26:00] little it was important to John and the
[26:03] disciples and all the ones that wrote
[26:05] this they wrote it it was earthly
[26:06] earthly messages that wrote this down so
[26:09] you were born by the word just the same
[26:11] way that he was born by the spoken word
[26:13] from a heavily Angeles
[26:15] and the spirit understand marriage woman
[26:17] people feel the work the there the river
[26:21] Jordan the unknown and came Oh only him
[26:24] and he said he told gentleman doesn't
[26:25] fulfill all righteousness because his
[26:27] purpose was to fulfill all the word and
[26:29] just moving on down the line from the
[26:31] anointing of the River Jordan attacks
[26:33] your birth all the way up to the hear ye
[26:35] him about Transfiguration attacks your
[26:37] adoption He fulfilled all these
[26:39] different phases in the life of the
[26:41] Christian and he was identified in an
[26:43] inscription collect by Aaron and then
[26:45] you can compare your life with that he
[26:47] spoke the word he combated Satan the
[26:49] same way that a Christian combats the
[26:51] devil he'll earnest in the 40 days of
[26:53] cetacean the 40 days where he he used
[26:57] the sword of the word against the devil
[26:58] you know what the word I heard somebody
[27:01] say this recently I thought it was so
[27:03] good I'm going to reuse it the sword is
[27:05] really useless unless you use it it can
[27:07] be laying it on the trail or lay down on
[27:09] the paper or laying around here on your
[27:10] shelf and it should pick it up and use
[27:12] it well I'm good to go do you pick up
[27:14] the sword and go to battle with it he
[27:17] learned obedience to the word Hebrews
[27:18] 5:8
[27:19] he grew in grace look to 40 it was
[27:22] accepted allowed Transfiguration and all
[27:24] of those things he showed that he was
[27:27] the manifestation of what was written in
[27:28] God's Word now let me go - let me go to
[27:32] our real medial Scripture and we'll
[27:34] start lining up here in a few minutes
[27:36] Galatians chapter 4 verses 67 now this
[27:42] is one that's a little bit it's a little
[27:46] bit me and you don't have predestination
[27:51] right to understand this well brother
[27:53] Brennan was preaching on this you say
[27:54] you say yeah I felt like a Calvinist
[27:56] when I'm talking about this and they
[27:59] said and because ye are sons God hath
[28:03] set forth the spirit up your son into
[28:05] your hearts crying Abba Father because
[28:08] your sons then God says his son is
[28:12] spirit of you
[28:13] well that sounds that sounds backwards
[28:15] it that sounds like it should say you're
[28:19] you gotta get be born again first and
[28:22] then you can be sons
[28:24] what's he talkin about here
[28:26] and verse seven he says we're pulled out
[28:28] and now our Nomura servant but a son and
[28:30] if a son then an heir of God through
[28:32] Christ and we've been talking all this
[28:34] time about being written in him about
[28:35] how you would participate eternally the
[28:38] word is present eternally but your farm
[28:40] at work God God never had and youth all
[28:42] about you he knew that you were going to
[28:44] come to receive it let's see what my
[28:46] friend said in the Smyrna interchange in
[28:48] the church age book he says - but when
[28:53] the fullness of the time was come God
[28:55] sent forth his son made of a woman made
[28:57] under the law to redeem them that were
[28:59] under the law that we might receive the
[29:01] adoption of sons and because your sons
[29:05] he just realized collecting scripture
[29:06] again Godman set forth the spirit of the
[29:08] southern your cry Abba Father the verity
[29:11] is Jesus Christ came forth died upon the
[29:15] cross and accomplished redemption
[29:18] restoring to original owner by means of
[29:20] purchase or paying the price and thereby
[29:23] placed us as sons he did not make us
[29:26] sense for we were already his sons but
[29:30] he placed us that sons for as long as we
[29:33] were in the world in the flesh we could
[29:35] not be recognized as the sons we were
[29:38] held captive by the devil but we were
[29:41] sons nonetheless and here this and
[29:43] because you are sons God has sent forth
[29:46] the spirit of his son into your heart -
[29:48] whereby you cried father father upon
[29:50] whom - the spirit fall at Pentecost sons
[29:54] a court upholds sons while they heard
[29:58] the words if this scripture confuses you
[30:01] know Beatrice confusing - I understood
[30:03] it give any little bit go back because
[30:08] before God he always knew you he knew
[30:11] that when you came into the world of a
[30:13] born of your earthly father and mother
[30:15] he knew that one day you would hear the
[30:17] word and let it throw the wind a little
[30:18] bit at first but one day you would open
[30:21] up the door of faith and let him come
[30:24] inside
[30:25] and then that eternal life that was
[30:28] predestinated for you that eternal life
[30:30] was predestinated eternally but he knew
[30:32] you would receive it and when you
[30:34] receive that you're joined with him and
[30:36] so he always knew that you were going to
[30:39] be a son of God and because he only knew
[30:41] that you were going to be a silly God
[30:43] he's president if God it's a friend of
[30:46] Justin Raja there's no past and future
[30:49] with him it's always right now that's
[30:52] the simplicity of the message we're
[30:53] always looking to the past to the future
[30:55] to see what God's going to do be doing
[30:57] he's doing something right now you you
[31:01] are sons of God we because you can see
[31:04] yourself in orderly let me see if I can
[31:07] give an example let me give so an
[31:11] example somebody that saw herself in the
[31:12] word and recognized the gunner and he
[31:15] had always had it in his mind or finish
[31:17] right here and look chapter 1 26 31 this
[31:20] is good story we're all familiar with
[31:22] the angel Gabriel came to Mary and in
[31:25] the sixth month the angel Gabriel was
[31:26] sent from God to a city of Galilee named
[31:28] Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man
[31:31] whose name was Joseph of the house of
[31:33] David and the Virgin's name was Mary and
[31:35] the angel came in an erotic hail thou
[31:38] that art highly favoured the Lord is
[31:41] with thee blessed art thou among women
[31:44] Losey quote from now he was quoting from
[31:47] the eternal mind of God and that came to
[31:50] be written on the thinness and letters
[31:52] here and then we can read their lingo
[31:53] back when you go back and see what God
[31:56] thought about Mary but the angel Gabriel
[31:59] knew who Mary was and what her purpose
[32:01] was before she had even fulfilled it and
[32:04] Mary knew that the Scriptures talked
[32:07] about how that Jesus discords in Messiah
[32:09] would be born in Bethlehem but she knew
[32:10] that I they had prophesied that a virgin
[32:12] will conceive but now the engine was
[32:15] speaking to her by what was written in
[32:17] the scripture and she could be
[32:18] identified with it now her eyes will
[32:21] open and she saw that scripture was
[32:23] about her that she had a part to play in
[32:27] the fulfillment of that story
[32:28] right it's alright that makes me feel
[32:31] good I look to my feet what I'm talking
[32:35] about man and when she saw him she was
[32:38] troubled at his saying in cast her mind
[32:41] what manner of salutation this should be
[32:43] in the angel said in her fear not Mary
[32:45] for thou has found favor with God and
[32:47] behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[32:49] and bring forth a son and shall call his
[32:51] name Jesus he told her the name of God
[32:54] and I'm not going to get all this but I
[32:56] was going to get back to how God Rice's
[32:58] naming you and and now that death
[33:00] benefit that's a revelation of who you
[33:02] who you are and those kind of things but
[33:04] then she says very important words being
[33:07] unto me according to thy word and that's
[33:10] that's the real secret of the Christian
[33:12] life when you just say other what I
[33:15] believe it I don't know where so we just
[33:17] open up this to open up this like what I
[33:20] said you know that that shield that Paul
[33:22] always talked about an armor of
[33:24] Christian he said it was shaped like a
[33:25] door the shield of faith that you can
[33:29] open up the door of faith to God and let
[33:32] him come in then all of these promises
[33:34] can be made manifest you amen amen
[33:40] we'll stop right there
