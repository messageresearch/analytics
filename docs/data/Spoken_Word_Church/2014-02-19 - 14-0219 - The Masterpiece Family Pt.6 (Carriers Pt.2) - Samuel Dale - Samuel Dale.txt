will be in uh Alabama and then it will be here in May so remember these announcements anything else I'm generally forgetting something but just remember it okay if you like turning your scriptures turn to Joy 2 and to Luke 1 Joel 2 and Luke 1 I want to try I was going to try to continue on the thought going on a little bit but it just kept coming back so I want to make sure you understand right where I'm at and what I'm talking about right now about the carriers the things like that and what's going on because if you miss this you're certainly miss the rest of the message as we keep on trying to progress further and further and I want to make sure that you you you follow that and understand it so we'll just stay on it till we get it or whatever but we'll do that father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us we thank you for your word we pray now that you would just come and be with us and bless us tonight with your presence let your understanding be with us and Lord most of all forgive our sins remember those that are sick Among Us Lord and you just you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you and we pray that you would just do that remember all the sick ones Lord there many things and all thank you for being with with sister Mara there and the baby being born and everything being fine we pray that you would just bring it on home everything be all right we love you and we commit everything into your hands and thanking you for all things in Jesus name amen Joel 2 we start reading in verse 25 and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the pommer worm my great Army which I sent among you now God didn't send that like making it come he permitted it to come into being it's not like the reading of it is saying my great Army which I sent among you uh you know now he allows things to come to drive us to him and permit those things to happen all right and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed okay let's go over to Luke 1 and we'll read 35 through 34 then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the high shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which is shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Baron for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold a handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word the angel departed from her you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now trying to get a point to us you know about why a the prophet would speak of the carriers and even call the denominations the carriers and and uh would call the prophets carriers and and I was noticing one there today he said we are carriers all right that's right now that is you know the point of understanding it is look at the grain of wheat that one grain goes into the ground it comes forth in uh you know a multiple form yeah but what does it come forth with the two little shoots come up Joel is saying I will restore so then the two shoots comes up that's that's the that's your grain right you know that's that you say but but no it's not grain now that mean it's not reusable grain it's not capable of being planted but it is a wheat field of grain you know cuz that's what it is it has to go through those things to come up you just don't see a uh put a grain of of corn or wheat in the ground and you go out there and look and they just a bunch of wheat you know grains just jump up out of the ground it has to have a way right to come forth and that way then when it's used and comes forth it will come forth into the correct way it's supposed to be all right because that corn of wheat we know was the Lord Jesus Christ the son of man he had to die and go into the ground all right then he came forth in a multiple form on the day of Pentecost but we know that that then had to die and go into the ground to to be able to come over where we're at because if it had not have went into the ground you say well why did it have to go back into the ground well then you and I wouldn't be here right amen right simple language plain sensible think about it you not I wouldn't be here if they' went right on there in the book of Acts and brought it forth and the opening of the word would have come come to them and you and I wouldn't be here so we better thank God that there is these things but the point I'm wanting you to see is that God done it that way to where that it would bring forth and we know and we've studied it that it's got to go back to the original grain that went into the ground right all right not saying that Luther wasn't grain he was he was wheat amen wesle was wheat yeah right but not in the the finished product all right the cornstalk it's St it's green and I trying to explain our Sunday and in this plane the natural that that cornstalk it comes up all of that stays green amen until finally all of the life is pulled up into the corn after the corn forms in the Shook and each one of those stages has to be there right if not you would not have an original coming back that's right it must have those stages and it's I wrote down in my notes like this that it's not just complimentary every how you would make those big words to the bride of Christ to talk about being grain and being carriers it is very complimentary amen it is very uh wonderful for us to watch and see the the stages of the thing and realize that God kept his word right you know to say I will restore all right so he's going to bring it back to the original and in doing that somebody had to make manifest each stage right now so if it's coming back to the original grain that went into the ground somebody's got to make it manifest amen but I wrote this down just as a thought brother and I were talking a minute ago about something and I said it this way to him the people will say but I I I just don't see things going on if if we was where we thought we were we would see great things taking place you know what the trouble is you right there now get upset with me do all you want to but that's the truth you are the one that's causing the trouble when you have that idea do you think the children of Israel was really happy and glorious and the preachers was preaching and God's going to send us a deliverer don't you think that they told him about it through the 40 years they were there come on they knew the scriptures the scriptures said a deliverer would come right but was they glowing around Glory Hallelujah Del is coming look at all this oh we know it's here they didn't even accept it when it got there that's right that's right they turned down the deliverer and had to wait 40 more years well was that 40 years good things how would you like to been back there when when you was making clay and bricks and doing that and then Moses come along said we're going out of here and then they reject it and they didn't do it and then you know what happened the taskmasters begin to make them go out and get their wheat and different things and you know that's right probably killing a lot of them to make them work see we think it's supposed to be a Glory Hallelujah when we're the unbelievers right it doesn't make no difference what what happens or don't happen you can be a one person cuz that's what the prophet said God's waiting on one man you know the were revivals always been sprung by one man that's right one person or one lady that was cleaning the pews in the church all right see we've had the profit thank God he brought us the word right all right but that Prophet is the one that said the bride would have to become the word amen well I just don't see it well as I said when Moses was down there they shouldn't they wouldn't too happy and 40 years later they did definitely wouldn't happy right you say yeah but we's promises and it's taking place around the world right all right but think about it whose fault is it that we don't see God moving I've had this throw it in my face for 40 years so it don't make no difference you know yeah but we're supposed to look and I do right I look for great signs and wonders but you know what even the Lord Jesus had to leave a city one time is that right right right why because of their unbelief he couldn't do any Miracles there God himself amen I'm not trying to justify something This is 40 years that I've been preaching it to you so it's not something to say well he's trying to make an excuse no I've been in a Revival 40 something years I don't know about you I'm in a Revival every day when God opens his word to me and shows me his word right amen what kind of a Revival are you looking for but see that offends people and they get all upset at you because you just expose the things you know but see everybody wants that they've got it figured out out to be a certain way well you know what when we get it figured out to be a certain way it's not going to come that way right it's going to be his way and he's going to do it all right right and I believe he's doing it don't you I mean I believe it if not what are we doing brother Brown says you sympathize with the message what does he mean by that right you sympathize with the message you know that means you don't take it for nothing but you you go along with it because you know that there's some things of it so what does it mean sympathize with it right and you see church then when we do we we wind up blaming everybody else instead of looking to our own selves it's it don't matter how what everybody else does it's what we're doing that's right amen all right see that's all I've ever tried to get us to do is to look at it correctly and to see the hour that we're living because each age had to find the message of that age that's right and they rallied around that message of that age yes sir right and they made manifest that message of that age and the prophet said and we'll read it tonight where he says in the Masterpiece he said it's up to the bride to vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 but see we want to blame everybody else instead of just simply going along and just trying to move along right and be what we're supposed to be right I've never tried to to to bring anything other than the word of God to you and I yeah but we just word word word no we don't have no life that's your fault you tell me we don't have no life that's your fault that's right come on you admit it by questioning it because you see I believe there is life amen that's right all right but I I thought it'd be that that's where Eve thought that too you know she kind of got confused on Hebrews 13:8 is that what the prophet said well you know evidently we could be confused on that but you see I'm wanting us to see what it is why would a prophet call Luther wesle him carriers y see that looks like it's degrading no if you've read what I've asked you to you've seen him speak of it being like that and speak of denominations and that but you've seen how great he spoke of them too that's right right think about it then stages or whatever you want to call it you got the stalk the tassel the hus and things you know coming down and it comes down to the Shu well you know each one of them is valuable right amen you don't go out there when the corn gets ready that you can start eating and we explaining something you don't go out there and take it all off and go throw it in the barn they rotten you got to leave that until it dries the life comes up through everything and goes out into the seed amen what don't you believe that's the day we're in right but as I said then we if we would back there with them and well I I just don't see nothing going on here comes a man walking down through there yeah he's leading a little old donkey with a child sitting on there and his wife evidently there must have been another child born on the way cuz he winds up with two children somewhere in the way he left out with one and how many people do you think KN knew Moses was there probably very few right oh they heard of about these things but they heard of them before but see who kept it from them the religious leaders right right but listen it was the life I have tried to explain it it's the life so what we're going to do tonight we're just going to read a bunch and then you you you can't say that you didn't hear what he said so watch let's read a little bit I told brother Joe would be pretty bad cuz he ain't got Brother Anderson but I think Richard went back there to he so got Josiah he's running to stick to keep up with me so you know I told him I said we're going to probably read tonight but look what he says number one of the Rapture now a lot of these we had them Sunday and things but I just want you to think about the Rapture message paragraph 115 preach 1965 1204 now the life that come up through Luther was what made Wesley right the life that come out of Wesley is what made Pentecost the life that comes out of Pentecost makes the wheat but they're carriers see the real life goes through that see what you want to do is you want to your mind goes that well everything back this way is carriers well it becomes that but it remember when it was green it was a carrier yep right I mean we're in the fall of the year there's no leaves on the tree but the tree is not dead amen it's said dead is what people look at it but it's not dead Li in the ground right right well look the real life goes through there the message goes through but it's heading up into the wheat that's the reason the wheat come up and brings the whole thing in the Rapture right up here at the top see now you go cut that off down to there and you can't bring up nobody right right so don't cut the stalk down leave it alone look the bride itself comes out of each age but the denominational stalk dies now the stalk will eventually die the shu dies the the silks dies all of the thing will eventually die but inside now not inside of the stalk you can't take the stalk and plant it you can't take the Shu and plant it that's righten but you take the corn and plant it that's right right is it sensible see the denominational stock dries dries up and dies have you noticed this last days it's begin to pull away now when that wheat begins to grow then the shook begins to get away from it all right you look back there in the day he was here and they rejected him right right CU as I was explaining there the other day are trying to blood of random was part of the body of Christ amen why he was greater than all the prophets he he had more gifts he was in the body of Christ so they was pulling away from him right right right the one man that had the ability so watch as it goes on now look what he goes to Masterpiece 6475 paragraph 129 the wheat after the tassel after Wesley puts forth the husk which is the foremost like the Grain and anything El of anything the husk is more like the grain it's coming more like the grain all the time the one that went into the ground and when it comes forth the stalk it's got life in it right STG got life in it but it sure isn't the grain Right comes forth a tassel the pollen it still isn't the grain you can't plant as it said the tossle the the stock the thing then it comes forth the husk and it's just in the shape of the wheat just exactly like the grain of wheat but yet it isn't the wheat just exactly in the shame the same shape you know why because it's housing around it is why it's in the same shape right all right but look what he goes on to say now in the seed not air with the shook paragraph 9798 and and so does the seed other denominations persecute the genuine grain it's got always got to be that way they'll not be ARS together they're not associated together they're absolute two different promises two different times two different people all together one is the bride the other is the church no comparison at all with them well what about a stalk now comes up and it's green and it's got life a tassel a shook Etc it's got life it is the true bride and it's day but when it denominates and dies and dries up see then it becomes a church right right that's right watch but still they are not the seed that's promised to come well they wouldn't see brother D no he's not explaining that I've been over and over said neither was Sarah neither was and neither was Hagar neither Sarah or neither Mary was the seed Mary was not the seed she was a carrier of the seed but she had nurtured brought forth out of her womb just like the shook brought forth from its womb the real seed but the shook is not the seed it only is closer to the seed it hugged up around the seed way back in the stock the life is scattered all throughout the stock okay life is done and when it comes to the pollen it's Gathering down closer but when it comes to the Shu it's right down there like the seed and it forms almost like the seed but why would he be speaking and and speaking and comparing ing Mary or comparing Luther with the the stalk and and and Wesley with the the corn coming and going for and then Pentecost with a shuck and say they wouldn't SE well they're not you can't plant it that's right you know there's no way to plant the stalk but yet at the time it was the carrier of the life there's no way to come to seed without the stalk being there amen that's right and don't try to cut it down now let it try and dive its own that's right when I come in this message you know what most of you know remember the big fight back then was to fight denominationalism boy everybody was against denominationalism that old Antichrist system and brother R going out there every day and preaching to him right Y and calling out people right that's right are you thinking about it but once but see they they are not the seed that's promised to come right that's it now there's many promises in the word of God and those promises will have to come to pass right right now we we got a choice of whether or not we're part of it right but they will come to Pi right yeah it looked bad when they rejected Moses right 40 years later it looked a whole lot worse but God still kept his promise amen it look bad for you and I but God's kept his promise but one is the bride and one of is the church the church dries up and dies but the bride comes out of each age coming on down all right simple church when we look at it but thinking about it see Mary he said is not the seed now why would he be saying something like that and saying that Mary represented a zeusa street Pentecost you know come in down because she was not the seed that's right the seed was in Mary right she was a carrier right so Had Each one been carriers right but you couldn't cut it down while it was in the stalk form you couldn't cut it down even while it's in the husk form you can't cut it down even after the corn forms until it lays in the presence of the sun to ripen as the prophet would call it but we know what is doing laying in the presence of sun to dry right right right cuz you can't plant green corn right you know that stuff you probably had for supper tonight you know the canned corn the corn you know and you can't plant that no that's right it's got to dry amen and do all the things but look what he says now let's go on the seed not a with a shook Los Angeles California 64429 B and finally upon the Earth came the genuine image of God himself again which was God the Loos was made flesh and dwelled Among Us now that same logos has a part he has got a bride and the same logos this word that cannot be tampered with is brooding over the church today trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation watch which the prophets was carriers to that seed because they were not the seed Moses was not God you said what he was God to the people that's F but he wasn't God no he wasn't the god of the people right what prophet carriers to the seed and the church denomination has been carriers to the seed see that's what people can't swallow let's just leave that out of there because them denomination that been well where did you come from that's right amen what church did you come out of true amen putting that on the internet putting it on everywhere what church did you come out of well I never was a Baptist I just visited there can I quote brother randam he said I carried a Baptist Bible and quoted them and converted them to a Baptist Faith y but see we're so well we never was you see people today you know and you remember it took you 20 years to get them out of their thoughts and ideas but yet they never had no bad thoughts all along okay rooing over the church to churches today trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation which the prophets was carriers to the word and the church denomination been carries to the seed now notice quickly but like this Shu hugs holds in the seed now then it leaves her right you see as long as we stay in the stage of carriers we're not manifesting the day that we're living they already have had those days right the prophet has had his day right when are we going to realize our day right right and and try to to walk into it to make it manifest going this is prag 77 see not a to shut Los Angeles California there's two of those messages remember now Mary was not the seed she was only the Shu through the seed the two others were carriers of Life only the natural seed Mary was not the seed herself but like faith in God's word brought a more real image of the word because he was the word but like the shook the uh of wheat or corn of wheat the shook holds the wheat inside of it and protects it until it is able or matur to go on its own come on now see then it was the seed itself that left her she gave birth right that's why she's not dead she's a carrier see just like the seed was in her Wom wounded she wasn't the seed she didn't produce the seed God is the seed amen that's right all she could do was say be it unto me according to Thy word now bless God I I found it okay Mama Told Me Mama told me because I got one in here in a minute where she says that her mother was Anna and Anna told her and she'd read it in the scriptures but that wasn't alive until that angel spoke to her amen all right listen go on God is the seed all right look at the seed not there with a Shook and Jefferson fi now 65 to9 28 uh starting with paragraph 99 she was not deceived Mary was not just a shook tassel talk carriers of part of the word right that's right not all the word Luther had justification West had sanctification Pentecost had to rest in the gifts but when the word word come now what did I explain the other day I tried to what made them denominations is when they turned this message down right amen they started dying right there right now they could produce that that justification will save a man right it'll work you believe that sure it was a carrier of the word just the same as I believe that the stalk is part of the wheat sure it is but it's a carrier it ain't the life see the life is in it it's not then Al comes sanctification how many believes in sanctification you believe the Bible you have to so so still that's not it's a little more like that's two more words but then come the Pentecost the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues they call it in the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues there they called the initial evidence which brought forth the what the shook but they they denominated all right now watch but when you come to say I and my father are one when you and say when he or brother brandom or what see that's what everybody wants a whole thing I'm just sitting around waiting because brother Brown's done done it all well keep waiting we've been around here 40 something years I was thinking about today 40 something years you know we started here July 4th 1971 look where we at but yet people think I'm exalted to say in 1969 that I preached the bride would be the son of man the fullness of the godhead bodily would be in the right they don't people don't want to hear that that's over 40 years then I'm not you think I'm worried I said then it would have to come and you know it's on tape that the biggest portion of people this message would die and go by the grave now you know that's on tape here 40 maybe 30 years ago at least well you know what if time don't something don't happen pretty fast you and I going to be them people right all right but says when you come to say I and my father one and these other things now you know you can interpret all you want to they no need of it these other things what the whole message right then the shook pulls away from it but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God in its fullness and in its strength for the same for he's the same yesterday today and forever notice in the wound of Mary was the seed but when the seed was delivered Mary never said I come to do thy will right Mary didn't say that that's what Jesus said I come to do thy will do the will of him that sent me I am my father one Mary never said I my father one come on if I do not hear Works believe me not th was the seed which one of you can condemn me of unbelief you can go through the me and who it is and all this going up notice and in the Pentecostal age through the Lutheran age through the wesle age it's been the same thing through the pent Pentecostal age and notice but at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelations 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God in full the full strength as it was when he was here on Earth manifested in the same way doing the same thing that he did when it was here on Earth amen Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and in Luke 17:30 Jesus said in the days as as it was in the days of Sodom when the son of man will be revealing himself again to be the same thing right look what he saying look at the next one see not air with a shook number seven paragraph 105 denominations has been the been the carriers of part of it part that is the word Luther had the word Wes had the word Pentecost had the word but not all of it come on for it has been hid from the wise reformers or the sealed away from them un until the age of the Eagles appear check that and see to make sure that he says Eagles on there okay the Bible said so yes sir because we're promised that in melachi 4 exactly we are he hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and if we just went through the Book of Revelations we find out that ever all three of those messengers of those beasts that went forth each one suited Luther just right and each one suited the other one just right which is the ox and the different animals of the Bible they went forth in justification sanctification even into the Pentecostals but the force was an eagle that's right and through that age God raised it up so it has to come through the age to be correct yes sir the eagle promise being fulfilled of Malachi 4 cuz brother Brown's a part of it right Jesus was not of Mary well why I don't understand it because he come out of her if Jesus was of Mary that'd make Mary God read in the book that's what he's explaining you people that think that Jesus was not of Mary but came through Mary like the life come through the shock go ahead we'll try to read fast paragraph 129 once the carrier of a true word justification then it become a carrier of sanctification it become a carrier of the baptism of the Holy Ghost restoration of the gifts but then when he goes on and keeps going back try to eat something Mana from another day is rotten it's no good a genuine Eagle of this day knows that was all right but we got that plus until Jesus Christ is made manifest in the fullness of his power as he promised to be in this last days okay what about it it's a promise well I just don't know whether that's going to be or not your Prophet said it's a promise so okay I'm going to stay with that you can do what you want to look the next one let's see wait a minute I got 149 yeah okay I got them listed on nine and going up down notice there will be no more carrier mother churches denominations after this carrier shook right there's no more carriers after the shook right all right so now wherever we're at it's getting close ain't it because after the Shu there is no more nothing left by then but just the grain is that right it's got to be grain it's got to be the same kind that went into the ground Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever a Spirit come upon the bride to do the same thing that he did see it's the reproducing again of the grain that's right reproducing again of the grain what is it it is the rising of the Sun that goes through uh okay let's read that one because this is part of part of that that we was on so look then what is it now we must be the father be about the father's business the wheat would cry back now we'll get to it the Lord willing Sunday how that what speaks of him speaks of you right so look what he's saying wheat would cry back the grain yes sir what must it do vindicate Malachi 4 vindicate Luke 17:30 vindicate Hebrews 138 vindicate St John 14:12 vindicate all of his word vindicate Hebrews I mean Revelations the 10th chapter of the opening of The Seven Seals the mysteries of God even to the serpent seed and all that would be made manifest all right going to the next number 10 you see this is the rising of the sun see it's not just Masterpiece and SE not there with a shook that you're dealing with all of these things of carrier and what it is and the word and the it's the whole message that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh if it was flesh in that day by the son the groom it's the flesh today by the bride right see whosoever sins you remit to them they are remitted whosoever sins you retain to them they are retain now the Catholic Church picks that up and they say well we got it but said watch it was the spiritual revealed word that did it I said right the spiritual revealed word that did it Feast of the trumpets 1964 719 go into the prophet's chamber and watch them seven steps where did the where did the guard meet the challenge challenge to bring the comer into the presence of the king at the top of the steps was in the seventh step there shows that we've got to come again with the same spirit that was on John we've been through that right he introduced the Messiah he was greater than all the prophets he introduced it and we've got to come to a place again to something that's going to introduce the Messiah we've been through that brother R him introduce the message to you and I right right so look what he said how will the Messiah watch the P people that's believing him know it unless other words how will the people that's believing him you know know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is Daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise would know they shall know their God now wrote it up a little now now he how he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know their husband right know her mate the reveal word that's why this has to happen so we've had to introduce her come on the prophet came and done his job to introduce the word he brought the word amen to introduce Christ to you and I we don't have to have another Messenger right or somebody to help figure that out well he should have said this maybe if he' said that we' understood better if he oh it was said exactly the way God wanted it said that's right all right amen watch it wasn't in the reformers wasn't in Luther Wesley and the Pentecostal them scriptures say it wasn't but it will come that he has promised for this age we're living the age that his coming will be in she must be identified in him in him come on any woman must be identified with her husband for the two or one and Christ bride has to be identified with him for the two or one and he is the word not the denomination the word we are to be the children of the light and the light is the the word which is to be which is made light for this age how do we know light except it comes from the word all right the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it right and the Bible said so so what is it when you see it okay go ahead to the next one number 12 the identified Masterpiece of God in Yumi Arizona 1964 12:05 so you see he has cut wants to cut the church out just like he did the son out like he did the bride and the groom to be his bride you must be part of him what not a part of a Creed not a part of the church not a part of the denomination but the the part of him H out of any other kind of a form won't work H out of that won't work you got to be hewed from the word the world cut off from you and just leave the word only alive in you the great scripture is counting on you willing to stand and to have yourself shaped into the likeness of his requirement that his word requires in the last days I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy Christ is identified Masterpiece of the word made flesh you are asked to be a identify as to identify yourself in him by the same word to be the Masterpiece for the bride you see Church why did I fought so hard and screamed and hollering about these doctrines and things of the message to try to keep you and I from getting into those garbage cans that has taken this message and twisted it perverted it and I don't mind standing and saying it you think I'm off you're Duty bound to come to me no you'll go talk to everybody else and tell everybody else where I'm off that you will answer for that's right one day that's right don't tell me you're going in Rapture when you're causing Schism in the body you're going by the grave it's all right go ahead do what you want to you said brother Dale you're okay come on I've offered it to you I've offered it on the internet I've offed it everywhere show me where I missed the prophet's message right now don't come to me about how my little silly attitudes and my ways of do it I'll talk about your silly attitudes and your ways of do it and that won't get us nowhere show me where that word says it that I haven't stood for it come on but look go to the next one I know that don't make me very popular spoken word Original Seed paragraph 135 through I think it's 139 the true bride Hallelujah there's going to be one why she's predestinated she won't be denominated cuz she's predestinated right right but's see their word is predestinated right see she don't have to worry about some denomination she's already predestinated to take the place look like Mary now I want you to get this now and don't fail are you ready say they said amen when Christ comes to his bride she will be a virgin like Mary was for God will not bring Christ through the wound of a and neither will he bring the bride he can't bring his word through a of his word them is horrible words but that's what the Bible says I'm saying what it says because it's this has got to be understood amen the prove true bride like Mary will have a virgin wound for the Bride of the word which is Christ now let me ask you a simple question if we're to have a virgin W how are you going to get one well brother so and so is going to stand up and speak it we'll all just get one goodbye get out of the garbage can it can only be the revealed word that can set any of us free righten that's right you can argue all you want to about anything it's only the revealed word can set you free whether it's a new birth or whatever it is watch when Christ the word comes to his bride she'll be the same as as he is a Virgin by the word oh God I hope it's going over brother Neville you see I hope you understand what was he word the word of God upon his vesture he had a name written the word of God in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he is God and God is the word when his bride comes she'll be the same product there he is Virgin did Christ belong to a denomination did Jehovah neither does his bride she is part of him she needs no no Dogma she won't have any she'll be absolutely virgin how by the word amen she'll punctuate every word of God every word God Says with an amen amen oh be it unto me according to Thy word amen my there you are punctuate God's word have a virgin wound what will she come out of a virgin wound the word what did Jesus come out of a virgin WB right what will it be let's see I think that's all on that but what I like it she's the same product all right virgin woman okay go ahead this is paragraph 2 11 of the spoken words Original Seed listen oh my mother is a blind woman now Anna was her mother and you're talking about Mary right you remember blind Anna was Mary's mother all right listen my old mother is a blind woman but she's a Godly woman to her lips she planted a seed in my heart I quoted that to a man one time he ridiculed me for 30 minutes about he is tired of that old mother Doctrine about how the mama was a doing this okay we planted a seed in my heart I've read it out of God's word that God said in Isaiah 9:6 a virgin shall conceive that's right so when the angel will come all he had to do just tell her what y right come on look at the next one restoration of the brid tree want to say it's not just in the couple of messages it's just those that trying to relate it you need to listen to the restoration of the Bride tree you need to listen to spoken word Original Seed but what he was God's perfect Prophet tree the example tree the bridegroom tree amen glory going to say something directly if he is the bridegroom tree do you believe it congregation said amen from the Garden of Eden amen then the bridegroom tree without the female won't bear fruit so he's got to have a bride tree she has got to be born of the same material the word made flesh in the tree is that the same material hope you get it it's the same life in this female tree the bridegroom as it is in the bride The Works that I do shall you do you shall that I do shall you also is that right amen he was a bridegroom remember on to the next one see not there with a shook paragraph 130 this is in Los Angeles California see it's just simple just like in this just like watching the corn grow you don't have to have some great theological interpretation of it just watch it you're he's right around you all the time see I got to stop I felt the little pool and somebody telling him you know look now the shook the stalk and so forth are only carriers of the word they had a part of the word see until they got down justification stif restoration by restoration of gifts in the Pentecostal but now notice just as it was Ish Isaac see and then to Jesus see one was a perverted one was the original and then here comes the seed itself see now the church has come from that same thing right back like a flower or anything else it drinks pulls in and goes of course there goes that thing again but if we were what we thought we were we would have great signs in wonders you are the reason we're not well brother you don't put your own self in there not on that statement I want cuz I'm going to put it back in your lap then I'm going to say as human beings we're all of problems you know what this is what I want you to see have you ever thought about that you and I come from somewhere Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostal Catholics right we came through some carriers right and you know what they were carriers until the word came to us right they were carriers why I want to reject a carrier you know what then this end time bride now click just a minute and listen this end time bride starts off as a carrier now you tell me we didn't right I'm going to tell you you're wrong well I never was in a denom you was one yourself what does it make any difference we was born that wouldn't we born between Eve and the serpent wouldn't it a denomination that was forign back there and a great man of God like Moses to Smite the rock the second time brother around said set up a denomination you and I started as a denomination and we come out of it and what are we trying to do now the day I left at Baptist Church I went to Gainesville and I told him I said God got me out of the Baptist now I want the Baptist out of me because I knew what we are until the word is birth in you and I that will start as carriers and if we don't progress any further than carriers we're not going right right to where we think we may be going by the ground that's cuz I'll never be little nobody when I said that about most of the people this message would die and go by the grave I said then and I still say it I'm not talking about nobody ain't got the new birth nobody ain't born again I'm just saying they don't want the word for you and I to become the word we start as carriers now Jesus didn't do that amen he was the seed amen why I brought that of the prophets being carriers all those prophets were the same brother randam come out of a Baptist Church he was an ordained minister in the Baptist Church he was an elder I'm quoting him in the Baptist Church right so that's why he would say we need this and we this or that right but look what he says bridegroom tree let's go to the next one what are we on number 16 17 okay they're getting above me all right see not there with a shook look what he says remember there is no more after that shook remember there's no more seed promised to a woman anywhere after Mary and there is no more denominations promised after Pentecost it's the Rapture and the bride coming forth from there the seed the word made manifest again so it'll have to be done now the next one by P 18 that's a repeat uh 19 Christ is revealed in his own word paragraph 89 so when you watch nature and you see wherever age and directly designed it out that we're in the last age the shuck has pulled away yeah he didn't say the shuck is going to pull away because look he says the shook is pulled away now you might think it's not important for me as I was trying to express Sunday that brother random was a part of the body of Christ that's right now we're going to get to the message where the bride is smitten from the church she's throw it out and he's part of it right but when he would say the shook is pulled away it certainly wouldn't pulled away from you and I right that's right but it begin to be pulled away from from him right now as John one man on patmas could represent the bride do you believe that you believe that in the Book of Revelation re 4:1 when John went up he represented the bride right so the prophet could represent the entire bride as one person I can't do it you can't do it we can't do it but he could represent the entire bride right come on you see nature shu's pulled away we've had 15 years nearly 20 now years of the message sweeping across from Nation to nation and this morning hooked up across this nation see and no organization it can't organize there has nothing ever been like it or we'll be herea see the thing that's the matter with the message today is those who obtain it in their heart now are you reading the thing that's the matter with the message today what is those who obtain it in their hearts must lay in the presence of the son to get Ren see you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all of the greenness out of you see making mature Christian see what I mean God is coming soon to receive his church and we must have that type of Christians for him to receive the wheat has got to be right all right go ahead to the next the invisible Union of the bride of Christ paragraph 190 and then the life comes out of that denomination goes into the grain then what happens when the grain begins to grain begins to grow and to get bigger so it can cover over something the denomination pulls away from why ain't we got a denomination out of this he said they will never they will they never will be you can't denominate this message because if it's back to seed how can you denominate a seed why ain't we got a denomination out of this they never will be it's the grain it can't go no further we're at the end time so what does it have to do now lay in the presence of the sun to be R and that's exactly right to be ripened into your heart to bring forth and live what we're talking about yes sir and we've been doing that for 40 something years laying in the presence of the son amen right now that's to some people to some people it's been playing in the garbage can of organized religion the whole time I come on I I don't you think I like to talk like that then in my heart I cry to think about the way the people of this message has been done and they're coming down fast on us y you're going to find out you're going to see who's word and who's not y That's Right can't hard to get church now you just wait till it com to a change okay see all right going to the next one what we got 21 I believe this is Tak on God's only provided place of worship I believe the church is beginning to hear the message this was 1965 and beginning to understand it oh we don't have to understand all we got to do is just believe he said a true ego will understand right but friend listen we got to lay in the presence of the son we got to be ripened our faith isn't ripe intellectually we're hearing the message that God has give us and seeing the signs that he showed us and proving it by the Bible it's there but oh how the church needs to lay in his presence till it tenders up you know and get sweet in spirit so that it can bathe down some sometime in speaking the message you get harsh have to break it in in like that because you got to clinch a nail to make it whole but when the church once gets it the elected is called out and separated then in the presence of God I know it'll be something like the people was there when it takes the Rapture now he's referring back to the people beyond the curtain of time if you want to tie it together so remember it's not up to us to manifest any other thing except one thing and that's to be the word Mary the shook has done her part it's up to you and I to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen now you know what we used to do mom used to and I loved them she made um fried apple pies I mean remember them you go your jar and you can get you something now yeah them fried appies were wonderful but you know what they had to do they cut them apples do them just right and you couldn't put them out on cloudy days and all kind of things you wanted them out in the sun but not to burn them down all day you wanted to move and do different things and that's what we kids had to do but we had to turn them and roll those things until they dried right see that's what God's been doing through a five-fold Ministry 54 Ministry has been taking this message and breaking it down to the people but most of them has been denominating their own little ideas that's right well brother Dale you're just one of them big old denominations come let's talk about it I'm open for discussion but don't bring silly ideas well I think bring me the prophet's message in the Bible we'll talk all right what are we on look and even what is at today this is the rapture uh I may this may be the repeat I'm not certain and even what is at today don't try to keep it for tomorrow burn it with fire before daylight come you remember that's what you do with the bread see this is the reason you don't do it for there's a new message coming forth and a new thing now look at there oh brother D there's a new message coming now you show me where it's at because I've just proved the point by the prophet that there's not another move beyond the the the shook except becoming the seed and the Prophet come to bring the message and he's part of the body bringing the message to you and I so if it's anything added to that what do we get the same thing the Bible says not a new message it ought to be that every time we listen to a take we get something new not different but new of the word right what is it see try to hold it over but that's been the attitude of the church a Revival Goes Forth and first thing you know within about 3 years they start an organization over it a denomination starts organization but have you noticed this has been sweeping the country sweeping for 20 years now and there's no organization and there never will be there never will be this is the end the wheat has come back to the wheat again the wheat has come back to its grain the shook has pulled away from it and the wheat must lay in the presence of the sun to be rened right let's go to the next one power of transformation paragraph 151 through 153 but see when it comes down now we're in the last age not back in the Pentecostal age there we're over here in the last age and the first Age begin with the word which was Christ and the last age has to end with the word which is Christ and these other things these Shucks and so forth as I have explained is just carriers of the word to serve its purpose until it comes into the full stature see of what the original grain was now is that the message we call the stature of a perfect man is that the one that he's talking about back to the original grain go to the next one this is do God ever Chang his mind about his word 65418 drop down to paragraph 43 you read all in between there and see it and see what he's talking about but you see we believe that we are carriers of a great message for this very hour that we're living in you want to do do that with us brother Anthony says amen we are carriers so we're going to start off as carriers but as I said Jesus never started as a carrier and then become a seed but the bride has to start as a carrier right the great Mary the gave birth was a carrier wonderful place the bride is pregnated to give birth to the word am I quoting the prophet so if she's pregnated to give birth to the word where's it at I don't know where this one came up or not but paragraph 113 through 115 the seed night a shook in Los Angeles California and that that's not my words it dece the very elect if possible he said that's not my words that's what he said now after a while maybe you'll get an understanding of what I'm trying to say now the seed certainly look more That Shook looked more like the seed until more than the pollen did and more than the stalk did but they were only carriers of the seed Luther organized the stalk Di Wesley organized the pollen died Pentecost organized the life died and now comes forth the seed you can't go any further than the seed can't go no further than the seat because you're back to as we'll get to it in another message or so down the road you come back to the son of man right amen the original seed that went in the ground that's amen but is a say then but everybody's looking they want to know where the signs and the Wonders are at I'm going to just tell you like what I think I think the greatest sign that could ever be is a group of people that would be able to stand in the hour that we're living and fight all these denominational spirits and ideas of preachers that come through to try to plant all their doctrines and ideas and that she would simply just stay with the word now may I quote brother brandom he said that God would try the people to see whether they would stay with the word or not not like I've always said you know we talking about manifested sons of God you know everybody wants to see manifest ested sons of God Well you certainly don't need a manifested Son of God to call for rain in a msum season right you might need for him to call it stop but brother Dale they sick among us I know that and I cry and I pray for you every night and I pray and hold you up call your name amen but you see we can't do anything until he tells us that's right amen when Jesus came to the end of his days now come on bear with me in this thing when Jesus came to the last few days of his life where was there any signs and wonders right when Paul came to the end of his days am I quoting brother right he was in jail got his head cut off didn't even have a coat for the winter time but yet he had the power within him that he had spoken the word and things take place I thought we believe the Bible when Jesus said I do nothing until my father shows me I thought that's the way we were supposed to be over 40 years ago people were talking about well I'll be glad when it comes we can speak that word I said then what I say now I said we got to have the word before we can speak it oh that didn't go over good then it don't go over good now but see that's not making excuses right excuses don't justify nothing Amen brother collie years ago preached a message about excuses I can still remember about height of it you want to listen to me for a while excuses when you're telling the truth it's not excuses when Jesus could do nothing because of the unbelief of the people was that an excuse when Paul come in his last days it looked like the the worst time of his life but the prophet said it was a crowning time of his ministry and he's getting ready to get his head choed off he says that's where that he stated that phrase right before there was prior to cutting his head off death where's your sting and Grave where's your Victory but you see we look at it we've got it all and we've had it in our minds to to look at it there it got to be signs and wonders I still believe there are signs and wonders taking place I still believe the sick is being healed that's right I don't have to worry about it I've seen the dead race I don't have to worry about it I've seen the sick healed of the word I don't have to worry about it yeah but I need it right now see now we're trying to tell God what to do what if he never chooses to heal you right what if he chooses to leave that there is a trophy of his grace why should we be so sarcastically and down and out about it and say thank you Lord could be a whole lot worse couldn't it Danny not that much just a matter of a few inches and he would hit a solid concrete situation what about it I'd love to see more miracles and signs and wonders yes and I strive for them and I believe in it but I also know the Bible and what it says if you you're going to try the word The Pride by the word then that means that you're going to sometimes have to back off and let them not exist alone because he doesn't do that he doesn't leave us but he's wanting to find out you know what brother R said he wanted to do he said he wanted to show to Satan that this bride wouldn't fall like Eve is that right but you see it's always come on brother musicians it's always the other person's fault it's always their fault you know the old saying is if everybody in the world was as perfect as I am it'd be a perfect world well I'm sorry the only Perfection that is left in anything is through God's word and if God says it now I'm going to end with the thought when are we going to start believing what God said he promised to pour out his spirit in the last days right now don't prop that up as to be in the zeusa street that was part of it the prophet said there'll come a time he'll pour out his Spirit on the bride I'm looking forward to that amen but like I said the people in Egypt the children of Israel down in Egypt when Moses come walking down Glory here he comes we going to quit throw stuff down let's go they didn't even believe him that's right they didn't believe him they got out done seen all the signs and the Wonders they got out in the wilderness and be claimed to murmur and complain right right that been for Moses they all been wiped out that's right think on these things it's not derogatory to talk about a people being carriers it's what we are right we are carriers but someday somebody's going to begin to say I and my father are one right and why can't we when Jesus in the resurrection he said I go to my father and I go to your father amen started right off talking about how great it was see why can't we believe what he said and just say Thank you lord it's a promise and say thank you Lord now you just come on the scene and make it manifest that's you remember what brother R said that time he said if I can't do something he said don't let me stand in the way he said that's the one thing don't let me stand in the way of somebody else let's stand think on these things what a great opportunity it is for a group of people in the end time to start off like everybody else but God is going to move among her I said that over 40 years ago why do you think I would want to back up now after 40 Years of hard fighting and screaming and hollering and preaching the message you think that I'm down and out about it no I got a whole lot more everybody knows I turn in front of my Bible 1969 in Athens Georgia that I preached the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man I've got pages on top of pages extra now of quotes to prove that with besides what I had then you think I'm not happy you think I'm not joyous to begin to see say yeah but look how bad it's getting I haven't seen it get too bad yet have you get pretty
