[23:11] Oh
[23:15] and I want to see
[23:21] amen god bless you good to be in the
[23:23] house of the Lord we are assembled here
[23:27] together regardless of what the world's
[23:31] doing if you will take your seats for a
[23:35] second I've been trying to find a little
[23:38] something to say and I found it
[23:41] everybody believed Martin Luther was a
[23:44] man of God right he was a born-again
[23:48] prophet of God for his age right he was
[23:52] one of the seven stars so we can take
[23:54] some of the things that he says that's
[23:58] coming from the Lord and in all this
[24:03] coronavirus and all this stuff that's
[24:05] going on in the world we forget that
[24:09] Martin Luther was dealing with the Black
[24:13] Plague which killed almost a million and
[24:17] a half people just in Europe not just a
[24:22] coronavirus it's just getting started
[24:24] but and I want us to show due diligence
[24:27] we do not ever want a maka devil but
[24:32] they can't have control over us because
[24:35] we're children of God we have promises
[24:38] that the world don't have we have
[24:41] benefits that the world doesn't have so
[24:43] I'm gonna read to you what Martin Luther
[24:45] said when dealing with the black death
[24:48] play he wrote these wise words I shall
[24:52] ask God mercifully to protect us
[24:56] then I shall fumigate help purify the
[25:00] air now this is back in the 1500s
[25:03] administer medicine and take it
[25:06] I shall avoid places in persons where my
[25:10] presence is not needed in order not to
[25:13] become contaminated and thus perchance
[25:15] inflict and pollute others and so caused
[25:19] their death as a result of my negligence
[25:22] if God should wise to take me he'll
[25:26] surely find me
[25:35] if God should wise to take me he will
[25:38] surely find me and I have done what he
[25:40] has expected of me and so I am not
[25:42] responsible for either my own death of
[25:44] the death of others if my neighbor needs
[25:48] me however I shall not avoid place or
[25:52] person but will go freely as stated
[25:55] above see this is such a god-fearing
[25:59] faith because it is neither brash nor
[26:01] foolhardy and does not tempt God amen
[26:06] and if you want to read that yourself
[26:09] and hold on to it
[26:10] it's on Facebook under so you're a
[26:14] pastor's wife sorry but I thought that
[26:18] what I was trying to think of something
[26:20] and I was just flipping through Facebook
[26:22] actually I was looking to see if anybody
[26:23] heard anything about brother Donnie I
[26:25] heard that he was still in the hospital
[26:26] still having test run but it was not a
[26:29] heart attack of those either don't know
[26:31] brother Donnie kind of fell over last
[26:33] night and during his church service and
[26:36] they took him to the doctor and EKG
[26:38] reports nothing so now they're checking
[26:40] for other things that's the last I've
[26:42] heard so we must be doing something
[26:46] right because the devil sure on a
[26:48] rampage he's got brother on Spencer in
[26:51] the in the bed and he's got brother
[26:53] Donnie in the hospital and he had
[26:54] brother Dale off for a little while so
[26:56] we must be doing something right that's
[27:00] the way I look at it but let's do like
[27:05] Martin Luther let's not provoke oh let's
[27:10] not tempt God we're a god-fearing faith
[27:12] let's don't be brash but let's be
[27:17] diligent if our brother or sister needs
[27:18] us we go to him because I truly believe
[27:22] that that we are under the protection of
[27:24] God he protects his children first and
[27:28] then all those others after that and
[27:30] we'll get into that in just a little
[27:31] while because even in the journey of a
[27:34] believer there are benefits that we get
[27:36] there were benefits that Abram got Abram
[27:40] got benefits even when he was Abram
[27:42] all right so let's stand back up and
[27:44] we'll address the Lord here that's
[27:50] already in our mist I believe just a
[27:53] modicum brother Boyd's class practice at
[27:55] 12:45 everybody got that same man don't
[27:58] forget it because I might also like I
[28:01] said remember brother Dale remember
[28:02] brother run brother Donny Reagan and all
[28:04] the different ones that are that are
[28:06] under the weather
[28:08] next Sunday Lord willing I guess if the
[28:11] planes are still flying will be at
[28:12] brother clogs in Oklahoma also April the
[28:17] 18th will be our Spring Fling at the
[28:20] ballpark in in Gil's Ville
[28:22] we'll keep announcing that later on
[28:25] April the 19th that is the Sunday after
[28:28] we'll only have one service and it will
[28:31] be brother Dale's 80th birthday party
[28:33] that day so we'll have food catered in
[28:35] and a big old cake and all kind of stuff
[28:39] for brother down so if you have anything
[28:41] you want to give him bring it that day
[28:42] okay everybody got that
[28:44] all right remember June 18th through the
[28:47] 20th will be our Father's Day fishing
[28:49] trip remember that and also your sisters
[28:51] you have something planned that weekend
[28:54] also sue you have those if we were to
[28:58] interject ourselves in it we'd get it we
[29:01] mess it up so y'all just take care of it
[29:03] sisters know what they're doing right
[29:04] well just like brothers we know what
[29:06] we're doing okay
[29:07] so let's turn the galatians 3 we're
[29:10] going to continue on a journey of a
[29:11] believer as we were talking last sunday
[29:17] afternoon between some of the brothers i
[29:21] and i want to tell you something that
[29:23] happened yesterday right in the middle
[29:26] of delivering mail the lord can talk to
[29:28] you because you're sitting there by
[29:30] yourself and you might miss a few boxes
[29:33] but they'll get it next week it's
[29:35] usually bills anyway our census listen
[29:38] take that census test okay
[29:41] it's not the government wanting to find
[29:42] out they already know where you're at
[29:44] okay
[29:46] but take the census because what it does
[29:49] is though if we continue in Terry on it
[29:52] gives certain monies can go to your
[29:55] place or you get certain benefits from
[29:58] the government if you want to say that
[29:59] that may be a misnomer but get benefits
[30:02] from the government but they just don't
[30:03] want to worry your app they want to know
[30:05] the population B anyway so anyway while
[30:07] I was doing that you know I was
[30:09] meditating a little bit on this sermon
[30:11] this morning I like what brother Claude
[30:14] told me one time he said he said brother
[30:16] wait he said Sunday morning you need to
[30:19] preach he said cuz that's either new
[30:22] people you bring you know you bring a
[30:23] business turn Sunday morning because a
[30:25] lot of you don't come back Sunday
[30:26] afternoon so you can't bring a visitor
[30:28] if you don't come so anyway he said
[30:34] Sunday morning you preached to your
[30:35] people
[30:36] he said Sunday afternoon you teach
[30:38] because that's the ones that want to
[30:40] come back in here and then Wednesday
[30:42] night is your core of believers that
[30:44] always gonna be there and he's exactly
[30:46] right because you can see it you can see
[30:48] it everywhere you go so so today we're
[30:51] going to preach but I want to we're
[30:53] still gonna stay on the journey of a
[30:54] believer but I was just a vowel asked me
[30:58] one time several months ago she said by
[31:01] the way she said I'm so new so y'all
[31:04] know so much and this this message is so
[31:06] vast and and so much knowledge that I
[31:09] that I need that that I've come in have
[31:12] I come in too late and boy what a
[31:15] concern well it can have man sir it's a
[31:18] real concern because we don't have 20
[31:20] years left or thirty years or in brother
[31:22] Dale's cases you know 40 or 50 years
[31:24] been in the message we don't have that
[31:26] to develop to get to this body change or
[31:30] a resurrection message or whatever we
[31:32] want to call it that we're and it's
[31:34] required for us to have it but I told
[31:37] sister vile I said you know what she's
[31:39] the absolute revelation of the 11th hour
[31:44] worker
[31:47] absolute revelation of the levinthal
[31:49] worker that levinthal worker was put in
[31:52] that Bible for you and me telling us
[31:56] that it doesn't matter the other ones
[31:57] worked 10 hours the 11th hour worker got
[32:03] paid the exact same amount of money as
[32:07] all of us I told us assists about you
[32:10] just make yourself available to God
[32:12] he'll pour it in because there's a
[32:15] promise you can take you can come back
[32:17] say God I'm 11th hour worker I've got to
[32:20] learn this message and let it be a part
[32:22] of my life faster than other people so I
[32:24] was driving down the road yesterday I
[32:26] was thinking of the young people all of
[32:30] our young people that are coming up that
[32:32] we're having these and they're asking
[32:33] some really honest and good questions I
[32:35] thought Lord Lord it's almost too late
[32:38] just like well you know I didn't think
[32:41] is this the Bible saying Lord is almost
[32:42] too late he said you tell him spoke to
[32:45] me just this plane he said you tell
[32:48] everybody he said I've come back to get
[32:50] you I'll come back to get you I will not
[32:56] leave my children alone I will come back
[33:00] and get them didn't go tell us that's
[33:03] what he's gonna do he said you tarry
[33:05] around here I'm gonna come back you show
[33:07] that's true that's when Jesus comes I
[33:09] thought he's already here

[33:44] Galatians 3 verse 16 god bless your
[33:46] heart Damle father Lord we pray that you
[33:49] be with us today the property God
[33:53] preached the sermon the world falling
[33:55] apart
[33:56] Lord we see that the world is worried
[33:58] about all these different
[34:00] with the bride we're taught not to look
[34:04] sideways or or left or right but look up
[34:08] for our Redemption draweth nigh and our
[34:11] help cometh from above by the we pray
[34:14] that you'd be with each one protect us
[34:16] all Lord we know we have to rub elbows
[34:17] with the devil every day but Lord you
[34:20] told us you gave us benefits Lord you
[34:23] gave us promises even Abram walked
[34:25] through many many trials and
[34:27] tribulations but Lord he came out to be
[34:30] Abraham and took a body change and went
[34:33] on Lord to be one of the the only father
[34:36] of our faith we hear the word Abraham
[34:39] being spoken now four or five thousand
[34:42] years after he left the physical earth
[34:43] but Lord we know his faith is just as
[34:46] real as it was the day that he walked on
[34:49] the sands of this earth over in the
[34:51] Middle East father we pray that you'd
[34:53] bless each one take care of us these are
[34:55] trying times we pray Lord that the fear
[34:58] would be taken out of the people but
[35:00] that we would show due diligence as you
[35:02] told Martin Luther what to do lord I
[35:04] believe by the Holy Spirit of the way to
[35:06] handle these different things Lord we
[35:08] pray this you touch each one bless us
[35:10] now continuous on our journey Lord be
[35:12] with us in this service today and give
[35:15] us our daily bread in Jesus name Amen
[35:18] now we're talking about Abram but let's
[35:22] look in Galatians now this is Paul
[35:23] speaking of Abram but he's now Abraham
[35:27] Glacius 3:16 says now to Abraham and his
[35:30] seed where the promises made he says not
[35:34] into seeds of many because listen Abe
[35:37] Abraham had many children even after
[35:42] Sarah died he had seven more kids there
[35:46] recorded in the Bible but they're not
[35:48] recorded to be the children of promise
[35:51] alright so here we go the Isaac was the
[35:55] only seed naturally but we know that he
[35:57] wasn't even the spiritual seed of
[35:59] Abraham that Christ is the spiritual
[36:02] seed of Abraham and then you and I by
[36:03] receiving Christ we become the spiritual
[36:06] seed of Abraham because that's what it
[36:07] says right here he says not in the seeds
[36:09] as the many so not seeds as the flesh
[36:13] but as of one and to thy seed which is
[36:16] Christ and I say that the covenant we
[36:19] talked about that last time excuse me
[36:22] that was confirmed before of God in
[36:25] Christ the law which was four hundred
[36:27] and thirty years after now remember
[36:29] Abram and Abraham that there was no law
[36:32] the law came in Moses they were just
[36:36] living under the best they could do
[36:37] coming from Abraham and all the way down
[36:39] through the people after the flood
[36:42] knowing all those people teaching them
[36:44] to do sacrifices and make an altar so
[36:47] the law didn't come till four hundred
[36:49] thirty years after Abraham says right
[36:51] here cannot dissin all that it should
[36:53] make the promise of none effect so it
[36:55] didn't matter if the law came the
[36:56] promise of God was going to be made
[36:58] manifested all right the law was put in
[37:01] because of transgression and we'll look
[37:04] at maybe later on this afternoon that
[37:06] the law was also put in to keep you
[37:08] clean keep him clean physically and
[37:10] spiritually right
[37:12] you're not dissing all that it shouldn't
[37:14] make the promise of none effect what was
[37:16] the promise Abraham was gonna have a
[37:18] promised seed for if the inheritance be
[37:22] of the law it is no more promise in
[37:27] other words if it's written down in the
[37:28] law if there's okay you get this you
[37:30] it's no promise the promise is but God
[37:34] gave it to Abraham by promise now let's
[37:36] go to Hebrews six verse 13 then you be
[37:38] seated for then God made promise to
[37:41] Abram Abraham because he could swear by
[37:44] no greater he swore by himself so in
[37:46] other words he didn't ask counsel of
[37:48] anyone he didn't ask what the devil
[37:50] thought about it he was his own counsel
[37:54] he didn't care what the devil said about
[37:57] it saying surely blessings I will bless
[38:01] thee and multiplying I will multiply
[38:04] thee and so after he had patiently
[38:06] endured what Abraham after Abraham
[38:11] patiently endured he obtained the
[38:14] promise he'd be seated in Lord add his
[38:16] blessing the reading of the word as the
[38:19] Bible says those who endure to the end
[38:22] Abram endured to become Abraham you and
[38:26] I start our journey as a young Christian
[38:29] and we have to endure to become Abraham
[38:33] or the faith seed it wasn't called the
[38:37] faith seed of Abram it's called the
[38:40] faith seed of Abraham all right because
[38:43] he took on a different name he took on a
[38:45] name change
[38:46] you and I must take on the name change
[38:48] also so if you got your Bibles let's
[38:51] turn back to Genesis 12 if the brothers
[38:54] just want to carry through we'll just
[38:55] run through the scripture real quick
[38:57] because we talked about justification
[38:58] and I want to read you a few scriptures
[39:01] on justification and what God said about
[39:05] it we've been through this many times
[39:07] before but if you pull up Genesis 12
[39:10] verse 1 just you'll just have to get off
[39:14] of that and then put up Genesis 12 kind
[39:16] of like we did last Sunday I'm sorry I
[39:18] threw that in on you but Genesis 12
[39:23] while they're getting there let me tell
[39:25] you something about justification
[39:26] justification isn't is the work of the
[39:29] Holy Ghost and it's what God does not
[39:31] what you do because if you justify
[39:33] yourself think about it think about it
[39:40] people have tried to justify what they
[39:43] did and look at a mess that takes you to
[39:45] but then we look and see though that
[39:48] being justified freely that the just and
[39:51] the justifier is the same person that we
[39:54] you and I are just as just as God is
[39:58] everybody got that say Amen we are just
[40:01] as just as God is or he's a liar because
[40:04] he said to just and the justifier are
[40:07] the same all right
[40:09] so if we're justified by God then our
[40:11] sins are put in the sea of God's
[40:13] forgiveness never to be remembered again
[40:19] pull up Genesis 12 verse 1 there you go
[40:23] here we go now the Lord said unto Abram
[40:27] get thee out of thy country and from thy
[40:30] kindred and from thy father's house now
[40:32] what's the first thing God's when he
[40:33] calls you what's the first thing God
[40:34] wants you to do separate yourself
[40:38] separate yourself from what you do what
[40:41] you did what all these things that that
[40:44] you used to do remember the song says
[40:48] the things I used to do I do them no
[40:50] more if you're still doing the things he
[40:53] used to do then you need to go back to
[40:54] ask the justifier to justify you not try
[40:58] to justify yourself
[40:59] all right everybody got that same in but
[41:02] now watch Abram Abram get up get out of
[41:09] your country and you'll come into a land
[41:12] that I will show thee I will show thee
[41:16] all right and I what's all these to all
[41:20] these eyes I've got him circled in my
[41:21] Bible in verse 2 and 3 watch this so it
[41:24] had to be nothing in Abram that was good
[41:29] you know although he's a Abram was just
[41:33] like his neighbor the only difference in
[41:36] Abram and his neighbor was when God
[41:38] called his neighbor the neighbor said I
[41:41] don't think I want to do that but Abram
[41:44] was the only one that God used during
[41:46] that time they said hey I'll do it no
[41:50] ain't that same way with you you come to
[41:52] a place where you say okay god I'm tired
[41:55] of running I'll do it because once he
[41:58] says look I will make I will make God
[42:02] says I will make of thee a great nation
[42:04] Abraham did not make itself a great
[42:07] nation God made him a great nation I
[42:09] will bless thee and make thy name great
[42:13] and thou shalt be a blessing and I will
[42:17] bless them that bless thee let me have
[42:20] seen that in their life and we all have
[42:22] and and like something I'm sorry they
[42:26] went to the top and curse them that
[42:27] curse at thee we've seen that also and
[42:30] in thee shall all families of the earth
[42:33] be blessed
[42:36] all families so Abram departed and I
[42:40] remember Abram is hi father
[42:42] he's not the father of Nations yet but
[42:45] he is starting a journey he does have a
[42:47] name you have a name that you become
[42:50] into the
[42:51] part of trying to do what God said you
[42:55] understand what I say I'm trying to do
[42:57] what God said all right but you didn't
[42:59] make a final decision one day and you
[43:02] said okay I'm leaving I'm leaving what I
[43:05] did the things I used to do I'd do them
[43:07] no more
[43:07] what does repent me repent means to turn
[43:10] and go into the opposite direction
[43:12] amen so Abram departed that the Lord had
[43:15] spoken unto him now his problem was and
[43:17] we were talking about last Sunday he
[43:20] took a lot with him that's pretty good
[43:25] play with words he did he took a lot
[43:28] with him I hope y'all got that life
[43:32] Sunday no I'm y'all a little slow but
[43:36] what he didn't say a lot come God didn't
[43:40] say take light God said Abram you get up
[43:43] you get out of this shape that you're in
[43:47] condition that you in and come and walk
[43:49] with me but why did Abram do Abram came
[43:52] out like I said before he took alot with
[43:54] him which God didn't tell him to do that
[43:55] but God allowed that because God allows
[43:57] you to take a lot with you when you
[43:58] leave because you're just justified the
[44:02] root of evil still there God has not
[44:04] done anything to put a spirit inside of
[44:06] you you've still got that old nature
[44:08] inside of you that old snake that older
[44:11] Demick nature Abram is still walking
[44:14] like a little kid in the candy store you
[44:16] don't really know what to do cuz look
[44:18] God's already said I'm gonna bless you
[44:20] bless your family bless the land you
[44:21] live on I'm going to give you this I'm
[44:23] gonna give you that and I'm going to
[44:25] bless even all the people in all the
[44:26] family in the earth it's gonna be
[44:29] blessed all families of the earth be
[44:31] blessed
[44:33] now there's the Covenant that God made
[44:35] but he didn't make it with Abram he made
[44:41] it with himself I just read it because
[44:45] he could swear by no other he swore by
[44:47] himself
[44:47] because the first company made he made
[44:50] is who were talking last Sunday unless
[44:51] winds and whatever was he gave the
[44:54] promise to Adam under condition Adam as
[44:57] long as you don't eat that tree right
[44:59] there you're fine okay that's
[45:02] conditional covenant that's a condition
[45:05] what did a what did Adam do Adam did
[45:09] what God said not to do he broke the
[45:12] covenant God said okay this is what's
[45:14] going to happen all right
[45:16] and we're still living under that now so
[45:18] that was pretty powerful because we're
[45:20] still living under the fall at the
[45:21] moment all right but the the condition
[45:25] that he put with Abram was I will I will
[45:29] bless thee I will do this all that I
[45:31] will I will I will I will I will so
[45:35] Abram is under a covenant Oh hallelujah
[45:39] Abram is under covenant he can't lose he
[45:46] can't lose because God made the covenant
[45:49] said i will make thee so we put a
[45:51] connection with abram that's why we're
[45:55] children of abraham we have that same
[45:58] blessing that the blessing of Abraham
[46:00] may fall on the Gentiles the Bible tells
[46:02] that's us so Abram departed lot went
[46:07] with him and remember that was a trouble
[46:10] that he had Abram was 75 when he
[46:12] departed just keep scrolling down and
[46:14] they remembered their Sarah now what
[46:16] does Sarah I mean at this moment Sarah
[46:19] means contentious oh my lord oh boy
[46:23] that's us oh boy that's nice he took
[46:27] Sarah with him but she's part of the
[46:31] plan she's part of the plan they took
[46:36] all these people and where did they go I
[46:38] told you that they they headed toward
[46:40] the land of Canaan which is the land of
[46:42] promise Canaan land is all of our the
[46:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost he's heading
[46:46] toward it he goes into it because
[46:48] remember justification is a work of the
[46:50] Holy Spirit it's not that you have it
[46:52] but if you're truly justified God is
[46:55] gonna those who is justified he's
[46:57] already that's weak those who is
[47:00] justified he's already so if God
[47:04] justifies you he's going to carry you
[47:07] through to glorification so they go into
[47:11] the land of Canaan you as a believer
[47:13] starts beginning to believe because you
[47:16] were an unbelievable
[47:17] or there and you start doing what you
[47:19] started doing what believers do you come
[47:21] to church you talk about the Bible you
[47:22] read the Bible you you you listen to
[47:25] messages you talk about God instead of
[47:27] talking about X Y Z whatever you you
[47:30] were talking about in Abram the same way
[47:33] because remember Abram under tradition
[47:36] it's not in the Bible
[47:37] but I was even looking on the internet
[47:39] the other day and even the Jewish
[47:40] tradition of Abram was he was an idol
[47:42] maker his father made idols and Abram
[47:46] made idols and sold them to people if
[47:49] you needed an idol for this you know
[47:52] 1995 you get two for one I don't know
[47:54] what you know even believe that's what
[47:56] he was doing so he wasn't in the plan of
[47:58] God at that moment but yet he was always
[48:00] in the plan of God you not have to
[48:02] remember one thing's for sure God knows
[48:05] who's gonna make it and who's not but we
[48:08] don't but we have to believe like Abram
[48:11] believed God enough to do something
[48:16] different he got up from that Idol
[48:19] making and that idol worship him and he
[48:22] left the position he was in same way
[48:25] with me and you if you're in the same
[48:27] position you were in you didn't get
[48:32] justified you might have justified
[48:34] yourself and started coming to church
[48:36] because like many people you look in the
[48:39] different I hate to say this but you
[48:43] know use the phrase you find Jesus in
[48:45] jail you know a lot of people do when
[48:46] they they just get caught just like the
[48:49] same way with the coronavirus you know
[48:50] y'all the churches that could go to
[48:52] church everybody's gonna come
[48:54] everybody's gonna presidents watching
[48:56] online right up in Gainesville Jenson
[48:58] Franklin right now as we speak why
[49:01] because people get scared and what's the
[49:04] first thing they do I had a cousin talk
[49:07] to me yesterday him and his wife wants
[49:10] to come up Church up here but he's
[49:12] afraid that we might be a snake handler
[49:14] or something but his wife has cancer so
[49:18] it makes you start thinking different
[49:22] but he's heard all the stories about us
[49:24] til us we don't get him out till after
[49:28] y'all leave
[49:29] I don't get them out when unbelievers
[49:33] that's why the unbelievers are in the
[49:34] mess we don't get them out but in any
[49:37] way but people are looking for things
[49:41] but now Abram wooden folks were you
[49:45] looking for God before he spoke to you
[49:49] to come to a place no neither was Abram
[49:54] he was setting his a little comfortable
[49:56] house he had a bunch of nice comfortable
[49:58] little friends that did what he did
[50:01] right right that did what he did and
[50:05] everything was comfortable and cozy
[50:08] there was no you know the economy was
[50:11] good the sale of the of the gods were
[50:14] good and we're all doing good and all of
[50:16] a sudden God says you need to go into a
[50:20] different place you need to get up and
[50:23] move if you're gonna be a child of mine
[50:26] you're gonna have to just get up and
[50:27] move you're going what what comfort
[50:31] blanket I got all this comfort I got the
[50:34] comforts of what what go charge we may
[50:37] go to church Bible let me see if I find
[50:40] it I mean really Abram was not thinking
[50:46] about God but Abram was chosen because
[50:50] God knew by predestination that he would
[50:54] choose the right thing that's the same
[50:57] way with you and I we can't kick you out
[51:00] we can't bring you in because that's
[51:02] like Martin Luther said if God's ready
[51:04] to take you and that don't mean always
[51:06] death but he said he'll find you and God
[51:09] found us doesn't matter you know
[51:10] wherever we were but he knew Oh Abram
[51:12] was sitting there in that comfort you
[51:14] know he was in that nest and he had all
[51:16] that feathers around him and he was all
[51:18] nice and and all of a sudden God just
[51:21] throws the nest out of the tree and
[51:23] Abraham's up on a limb you know what do
[51:26] you had to do you had to make a decision
[51:29] you and I have to make a decision to
[51:34] listen to what God said and move that
[51:38] don't mean physically move but
[51:39] spiritually move into something that
[51:41] you've never moved in
[51:42] you go whoa what in the world we you
[51:48] know listen drugs and alcohol and sex
[51:52] and all those different things that
[51:53] people do in the world that want on
[51:54] things that they do in the world mm-hmm
[51:57] it's just a fulfillment of what you and
[51:59] I feel today of the presence of God
[52:01] pulling us into a spiritual relationship
[52:04] with God they replace that brother
[52:06] Graham says they replace that desire
[52:08] with XYZ and that's what we do even as
[52:12] Christians we replace sometimes not by
[52:14] all that but we play we replace it by
[52:17] something and what to do when you
[52:18] replace something it brings you further
[52:20] away from God when you start inserting
[52:22] things in here Abram had a lot of God's
[52:26] inserted in here but God said hey you
[52:28] need to get up move so when you move it
[52:30] brings a whole new atmosphere and like I
[52:33] said last week if you can't relate to
[52:37] this if you can't see it in your in your
[52:42] Christian walk don't matter if it's
[52:43] fifty years twenty years or two months
[52:48] you must see that this is how God works
[52:52] and I thank God for it because it's for
[52:55] everybody he doesn't treat one this way
[52:58] in one this way and one better than the
[53:00] other because cuz you know sister
[53:02] cleaner could be back there and she
[53:03] could say I saw the Prophet you know
[53:07] what I can say to her Bible says blessed
[53:09] is he that has not saying more blessed
[53:12] and see if it has not seen why because
[53:14] we took the Bible she saw the Prophet
[53:18] but you know what she done she walked on
[53:19] with God she walked on with God and
[53:23] she's been walking all these years with
[53:25] God and we don't worry about people like
[53:28] that what we worry about people that
[53:30] it's like the wind they flow in they
[53:32] flow out now look Abram went to
[53:34] different places but he was on a journey
[53:37] he never went back to the earth childî
[53:40] it was never recorded he went back to
[53:43] his father's house why because if you do
[53:45] that then you didn't get justified you
[53:48] just thought you how to get feeling I'm
[53:49] going to read where brother Brown tells
[53:51] us that in Ezekiel remember in Ezekiel
[53:53] he gives you a new heart takes out the
[53:55] stony heart put
[53:56] a heart of flesh and he gives you a new
[53:58] spirit well we'll talk about that if we
[53:59] ever get into the sanctification where
[54:02] he gives you a new spirit but it's not
[54:04] the Holy Spirit no it's not the Holy
[54:07] Spirit but what does it do it puts you
[54:09] in a religious order it brings you to a
[54:10] place to where you realize I'm in a
[54:14] different place but let's go through
[54:17] this we gotta we gotta get back to
[54:18] justification just for a minute is that
[54:20] okay so Abram passed through the land I
[54:23] wanted to get back up here cuz I got all
[54:27] these written in my Bible
[54:30] now look so he went into Canaan but what
[54:34] happened to Abram let's go to verse 7
[54:40] and the Lord appeared unto Abram now
[54:43] listen in your journey that's why I'm
[54:44] breaking this down that's why I believe
[54:46] God told me yesterday I've come to get
[54:49] the little ones I've come to get the
[54:52] ones that needs more explanation of how
[54:54] to get the new birth not just sending a
[54:57] message Church and die now I just
[54:59] sitting and feel good and everything is
[55:01] good and I like that song cuz it gives
[55:04] me a chill that has nothing to do with
[55:07] Christianity the Lord appeared now
[55:14] somewhere in your journey even in
[55:15] justification God has got to appear to
[55:17] you because he said he would if he truly
[55:21] justified you the justifier is that
[55:24] close now he's not inside yet but he's
[55:29] that close to you he has come to you the
[55:34] Lord came to Abram and appeared to him
[55:38] now I'm not gonna go so far as to say a
[55:41] peer to him in physical form but you
[55:42] know what God appeared to me yesterday
[55:44] but it was a thought in my mind that was
[55:46] so clear that is what God was doing so
[55:48] God appeared to me and the Lord appeared
[55:53] unto Abram now Abram he's still dirty
[55:57] he's still got a lot with him but God
[56:03] knows that you need the guidance in your
[56:07] journey
[56:08] that's why I said he's gonna be so close
[56:10] to you all the way but then now I'm
[56:12] telling you you get to where you get to
[56:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you
[56:15] get on into this thing several years
[56:17] into your life and we can't be baby from
[56:20] the more we can't be looking for God all
[56:22] over the place to be you understand what
[56:24] I mean he wants you to grow up because
[56:28] you told Abraham he said when he comes
[56:30] to circumcision he really does he
[56:32] appears to him as Melchizedek and then
[56:35] Abraham from there to taking Isaac up
[56:37] and being offered up on an altar his
[56:40] only son there was a gap in between
[56:43] there well you don't hear a lot that God
[56:45] did a lot for Abraham Noah Abraham what
[56:47] Abraham was already on his walk he knew
[56:49] what he was doing he knew where he was
[56:51] going here this promised son right here
[56:53] with him he could see him physically so
[56:57] that was the promise same way you and I
[57:00] have the spiritual promises of God and
[57:03] the Lord appeared unto Abram and said
[57:05] unto thy seed now watch now watch what
[57:08] he's gonna tell Abram now you didn't
[57:10] tell him before he just said good get up
[57:12] leave all right go into Canaan and hang
[57:17] on there he appears to Abram and says
[57:21] unto thy seed will I give this land and
[57:24] there builded an altar unto the Lord who
[57:28] appeared unto him so Abraham Abram
[57:30] thought so much of that piece of ground
[57:32] he built an altar and he worshiped God
[57:36] now where's the altar we know the altars
[57:38] in our heart but we also need to stay
[57:41] listen you come to a state of
[57:43] justification I couldn't wait for the
[57:46] doors to open the church because I
[57:47] wanted to be around somebody that I
[57:49] wasn't around before to me this is
[57:52] safety this is the safe house of God if
[57:58] you don't if you feel uncomfortable
[57:59] today being here in this room listening
[58:02] to me or anybody else you got a problem
[58:06] you right then you feel uncomfortable a
[58:12] long time you told us you did you felt I
[58:14] mean here's a here's a young branch that
[58:18] has just grown from the tree not that
[58:20] tree
[58:22] but the tree of God we'd rather him we
[58:24] drive grab him grow out of the free of
[58:26] God then we know where he came from but
[58:29] but you don't kids you say I'm just
[58:32] wasting my time sitting here and I don't
[58:34] want to do this I'd rather be on
[58:37] Facebook I'd doesn't be talking to my
[58:39] friends and I'd rather be doing listen
[58:40] when I get done I'm gonna put my makeup
[58:42] on and I'm gonna pull my pants up and
[58:45] guys I'm gonna I'm gonna get with my
[58:47] buddies and we gonna tomorrow we gonna
[58:49] go
[58:50] you're not justified you're not
[58:54] justified you're justifying yourself for
[58:59] the ways of not wanting to be here um I
[59:03] don't like there's not a lot of things
[59:06] you know it today at this very moment I
[59:09] can't think of one thing I'd want to do
[59:11] besides doing this right I mean if
[59:15] you're when I was a sinner though mama
[59:18] would say you need to come Church so I'd
[59:20] come on Mother's Day and Christmas I was
[59:22] the C&E crowd the Christmas and Easter
[59:24] crowd let's just be honest I hated it
[59:30] Wow
[59:31] I wasn't then I wasn't an eagle yet he
[59:35] said oh well you always weren't please
[59:37] people please please I was a chicken
[59:42] I got converted into an eagle hold our
[59:54] brother bouncing hold on a minute
[59:56] brother Brown told us in one quote he
[59:58] said I always was a wheat plant I've got
[1:00:02] 22 other quotes that says I had to be
[1:00:05] changed from a cuckoo bird to a wheat
[1:00:08] plant what's he saying you got to go
[1:00:10] through a change
[1:00:12] that's what Abram did now Abram totally
[1:00:15] had to take a change to get into another
[1:00:18] place because he wasn't where God want
[1:00:19] him to be you were not where God wanted
[1:00:21] you to be if you're out there in the
[1:00:22] world and I tell you from an honest
[1:00:28] heart God will if you're a child of God
[1:00:30] at this point in time God is obligated
[1:00:33] to stir you up because you no one else
[1:00:37] is going to do it
[1:00:38] your mama can't save you your daddy
[1:00:40] can't save you brother Dale can't save
[1:00:42] you the strong leader can't save you
[1:00:44] playing good music don't save you God
[1:00:48] saves you but you got to do the things
[1:00:52] he tells you to do unto thy seed will I
[1:00:55] give this land and there builded he an
[1:00:57] altar and he removed from thence into a
[1:01:00] mountain on the east of Bethel the words
[1:01:02] Bethel exactly him house of God and
[1:01:05] pitched his tent having Bethel on the
[1:01:07] west and high on the east and there he
[1:01:08] builded an altar to the Lord look he's
[1:01:10] always built an altar
[1:01:11] what's an altar obedience and they built
[1:01:17] an altar to the Lord he called upon the
[1:01:19] name of the Lord go to the next talk
[1:01:22] about Beth Doyle go to verse 10 this is
[1:01:25] where we were at Sundy go to verse 10
[1:01:31] that may have to pull it back up because
[1:01:34] that's not the normal oh I like this but
[1:01:37] you can go to the Bible if you want to
[1:01:38] brother but we're gonna be doing this
[1:01:40] all through the journey of Abraham now
[1:01:45] what happened in verse 10 problems I'll
[1:01:49] promise you problems I'll raise it up a
[1:01:54] little bit more so so free to the short
[1:01:56] let people can see it and there was a
[1:01:58] but listen I'll promise you though
[1:02:00] here's Abram Abraham's got it going to
[1:02:03] the land of Canaan you think oh man this
[1:02:04] guy this is good I'm not with my friends
[1:02:09] anymore but now remember remember one
[1:02:12] thing you still got the devil inside of
[1:02:14] you
[1:02:15] God has not control of the inner person
[1:02:20] yet if I got that say Amen
[1:02:22] God does not have control he that old
[1:02:24] root of evil that ol Adamic nature that
[1:02:26] old fallen nature that nature you had
[1:02:29] you still got you got it because you're
[1:02:33] still going to lean to it because what
[1:02:35] happened the first time a virus that our
[1:02:40] famine comes in other words Abraham's
[1:02:42] and Canaan he's we're supposed to be
[1:02:47] well I can't eat anymore
[1:02:49] I got all these problems so I'm gonna
[1:02:53] let's go back into the world because God
[1:02:56] must not be with me that's not what God
[1:02:59] look Abram went into Egypt because the
[1:03:02] famine remember I told you what is the
[1:03:04] famine do it moves you it makes you make
[1:03:05] a choice but now he didn't make the
[1:03:07] right choice and not making the right
[1:03:09] choice he went down and the first thing
[1:03:11] you did was went back to lion again you
[1:03:16] had a lot lot didn't you
[1:03:18] that's okay I said you did after a lot a
[1:03:22] lot to cover a lot of things up you have
[1:03:26] to lie specially when you got Christian
[1:03:28] parents ladies and gentlemen hello I
[1:03:34] mean really yeah start lying cuz you
[1:03:37] guys start covering stuff up again cuz
[1:03:38] you go right back into doing it for the
[1:03:46] famine was Grievous in the land Oh
[1:03:48] Satan's gonna make you make a choice
[1:03:53] he's gonna say your mind still but what
[1:03:57] is this little white light to keep
[1:03:58] following you around what's this little
[1:04:02] power that I then I feel that I felt
[1:04:05] back before the foundation of the world
[1:04:06] but I'm feeling again what are you doing
[1:04:12] you're my greatest soldier you're my
[1:04:16] go-to guy when I need something done
[1:04:18] wrong right do that going yet
[1:04:22] oh I had the babies and I got scars to
[1:04:26] prove it too
[1:04:31] and then we all got scars of the things
[1:04:35] we did in our past but they're a
[1:04:37] reminder to me what God's done to me
[1:04:41] that what God did not what I decided
[1:04:44] listen listen Alcoholics Anonymous all
[1:04:47] those self-help things are good but
[1:04:49] unless God comes into your soul and
[1:04:51] burns that old nature out you will do it
[1:04:54] again cuz they tell you even in a a they
[1:04:59] say wants a drunk always a drunk now
[1:05:01] that's not true in Christianity once a
[1:05:05] sinner always a center that ain't
[1:05:07] something I want to attach myself to I
[1:05:11] want to attach myself to the same killer
[1:05:17] Moses turn around look he said you see
[1:05:19] them people in Egypt he said after today
[1:05:22] you'll see them no more that's the same
[1:05:26] way with you and I you and I cross over
[1:05:28] Jordan we look back sure you can look
[1:05:30] back because you look back and you see
[1:05:32] and God's gonna say that right there
[1:05:34] you're not going to see that anymore cuz
[1:05:37] I brought you to a place when he came to
[1:05:41] pass when he came near into Egypt now
[1:05:43] remember it here's the story I'll go
[1:05:44] through it real quick he comes up and
[1:05:47] Sarah is still a pretty lady
[1:05:49] so he starts lying and tells them to say
[1:05:51] this is my sister but he's not doing it
[1:05:53] to save Sarah look look Sarah I was
[1:05:58] going what do you mean save your neck
[1:06:03] you fiction again we've been mad for 70
[1:06:07] years and you fixin to give me to it
[1:06:13] in that's the way we are though look
[1:06:15] we're still in we're still in bondage
[1:06:17] under that old Adamic nature so we're
[1:06:19] going to lie cheat steal them do
[1:06:20] everything we used to do and gonna do it
[1:06:25] here Pharaoh just long as you don't kill
[1:06:29] me you can have my wife because she's my
[1:06:32] sister but watch what God did though in
[1:06:37] the two times that ABR Abram did it and
[1:06:40] Abraham did it that two times he did
[1:06:42] god never this is going hard to be hard
[1:06:46] to take God never punished Abram God
[1:06:49] never punished Abraham because he was
[1:06:51] under the promise he never did he
[1:06:55] plagued Egypt twice hey he closed up all
[1:07:02] the wounds in the land have any more
[1:07:05] children until you go back babe and I'm
[1:07:08] sure that guy's going that's not my
[1:07:11] problem
[1:07:12] that man lad but you know what God said
[1:07:16] though you look up at the top where I
[1:07:17] read you he said I will bless you and
[1:07:20] whatever I bless I'll bless you and once
[1:07:24] around you and whatever I curse or
[1:07:26] whatever you curse it'll also be cursed
[1:07:28] alright so they fell under a curse
[1:07:31] because even in your walk of
[1:07:33] justification if it's of God if it's of
[1:07:36] God God's with you because if he
[1:07:39] justified you in took you to
[1:07:40] glorification there's a journey there
[1:07:42] and he knows you're gonna make it to the
[1:07:43] end of that journey you and I don't but
[1:07:46] he does
[1:07:47] and then there Gyptians he talks about
[1:07:50] all that and then the lord of mercy that
[1:07:52] gets in all kind of trouble verse 17 and
[1:07:55] the Lord plagued Pharaoh in his house
[1:07:57] with great plagues because of Sarah
[1:07:59] Abraham what listen
[1:08:03] God's gonna plague this world because of
[1:08:05] you he's already pronounced plagues on
[1:08:09] this world because of me and you because
[1:08:11] my people are there I'm gonna reign
[1:08:14] plagues down on them on the earth
[1:08:17] remember what Pharaoh did Pharisee then
[1:08:19] get out of here
[1:08:20] look at chapter 13 now I don't know if
[1:08:26] we're gonna get the sanctification or
[1:08:27] not but we'll just continue on let's go
[1:08:29] to chapter thirteen and Abram went out
[1:08:31] of Egypt finally he gets out and all the
[1:08:36] hand he took but remember he took a lot
[1:08:37] with him and we were talking about this
[1:08:39] last last Sunday because what happened
[1:08:44] was as God was blessing Abram so much
[1:08:48] told that lot God that he had with him
[1:08:51] was being blessed too because He blessed
[1:08:54] the whole family's and I'm gonna bless
[1:08:55] your family
[1:08:56] but there had to come a time though to
[1:08:58] wear that God separated them God said
[1:09:01] okay sue Abram he went on his journey
[1:09:04] from South even to Bethel to place worse
[1:09:06] tent now watch he comes right back to
[1:09:07] the place and he made an altar of 13-3
[1:09:09] just keeps going up to 4 to 13 for under
[1:09:12] the place of the altar which had made
[1:09:14] that first and there abram call them
[1:09:16] name Lord now listen in your journey
[1:09:18] you're continuing to call one name of
[1:09:20] the Lord it's not just well I got called
[1:09:22] and I'm this special seed person and
[1:09:25] they can't nothin bother me and you know
[1:09:27] if I don't go to church couple Sunday
[1:09:28] that's all I finally read my Bible I saw
[1:09:30] it I'm a chosen know you've just
[1:09:32] justified yourself because the just and
[1:09:36] the justifier is the same person and if
[1:09:38] God tells you this is the way you got to
[1:09:40] be then we got to fit that there Abram
[1:09:44] called on the name of the Lord and a lot
[1:09:46] also which with him had flocks and herds
[1:09:48] and tents and the lamb was not able to
[1:09:50] bear them they had to come a place like
[1:09:52] we were talking about in your journey
[1:09:53] even in justification brother Branson
[1:09:56] you'll go right back to the beer joint
[1:09:59] yes you will what he said you'll go
[1:10:02] right back to that why because that old
[1:10:04] root of bitterness that over it of evil
[1:10:07] that old laminates are still there you
[1:10:09] still got that same desire but you've
[1:10:11] decided that you're gonna do what God
[1:10:15] said right but there comes a time in
[1:10:20] that justification journey that you
[1:10:22] gonna have to separate from what you did
[1:10:24] before and there was a strife between
[1:10:31] the herdsmen of Abraham's cattle herding
[1:10:33] them lost all them demons get to
[1:10:34] fighting each other in the Canaanites
[1:10:37] and the perizzites dwelling and then in
[1:10:38] the land and Abram said unto life let
[1:10:41] there be no strife I pray thee between
[1:10:42] men the end between my herdsmen the
[1:10:44] herdsmen but we be brethren because
[1:10:47] remember a lot was his brother you gotta
[1:10:48] remember a lot wasn't some just poor
[1:10:50] thought idiot the Bible said he had to
[1:10:54] write your soul but remember he didn't
[1:11:01] come out like Abram did because he
[1:11:03] wasn't the chosen seed of Abraham he's
[1:11:05] gonna be the foolish virgin he's gonna
[1:11:06] be the one that has to be given eternal
[1:11:08] life he's going to be the
[1:11:09] national person that lives the best life
[1:11:11] he can live and God will give him
[1:11:13] eternal life because of his works not
[1:11:15] because he's a child of God Abraham
[1:11:19] types me and you so there had to be a
[1:11:23] separation a point in time somewhere
[1:11:26] tell me rose that same way with me me
[1:11:29] and you both there was a time when I was
[1:11:32] and they'll test you all I had friends
[1:11:35] they tested me let's go hunting when
[1:11:38] you're gonna leave
[1:11:38] oh we're gonna leave on Friday that's
[1:11:40] good okay I'll ride with you we're
[1:11:41] coming back Sunday afternoon you know
[1:11:45] the old me used to say I was fine I
[1:11:47] don't care
[1:11:48] Sunday's another day on the calendar and
[1:11:50] everybody else is going to church
[1:11:52] there's not as much traffic on the road
[1:11:53] and weeding deer hunt and we can come
[1:11:54] back home but they test you though they
[1:11:56] said no we're gonna come back on Sunday
[1:11:58] you know what you say what do you say
[1:12:00] now that you didn't say then you say no
[1:12:02] I'll Drive I'm coming back Sunday night
[1:12:04] because I'm going to church cuz you know
[1:12:06] what they're watching you they're
[1:12:09] watching you fervently watching you and
[1:12:12] wanting you to make a mistake cuz that's
[1:12:15] the devil the devil is wanting you to
[1:12:17] make a mistake but God is there close
[1:12:19] with you to help you like you did with
[1:12:22] Abram Abram comes to light and says
[1:12:25] alright light I've carried a lot oh I
[1:12:27] won't carry I'm not carrying a lot in
[1:12:30] the more me and you go separate you pick
[1:12:34] your land and I'll take what's left over
[1:12:37] in that guard you pick if you cuz you
[1:12:41] know what he's gonna get the seemingly
[1:12:43] greener pasture the drugs alcohol the
[1:12:48] stacks the women there so that of this
[1:12:50] just name it whatever it is oh it's so
[1:12:52] wonderful out there in the world it just
[1:12:54] tickles you flesh right but there comes
[1:12:58] a time though when Abram comes on the
[1:13:00] scene and lot is right here and Abram
[1:13:06] says I'm not gonna do that anymore but
[1:13:09] you pick whatever green pasture you want
[1:13:11] and Lauda is always gonna pick it's a
[1:13:16] little comical but I'm some of you
[1:13:17] already fell asleep too early in the
[1:13:19] morning great
[1:13:21] I read a book one time says the grass is
[1:13:24] always greener over the septic tank
[1:13:30] think about it what's making it green
[1:13:36] hmm good you know they always say the
[1:13:38] grass is always greener on the other
[1:13:39] side the grass is always greener the guy
[1:13:41] was making a point he said the grass
[1:13:43] sees through the grass you see the
[1:13:44] screen and growing this usually got
[1:13:45] underneath pushing today it's like the
[1:13:48] way the world is God's going to give
[1:13:49] them these things gonna give you a real
[1:13:50] green pasture he's going to give you the
[1:13:53] plains of Sodom and Gomorrah there's
[1:13:55] plenty of water oh there's all kind of
[1:13:58] good stuff for my cattle and my drinking
[1:14:00] and my and I got room to do it
[1:14:04] the least we had room to do it that way

[1:14:22] same devil same demons they may just
[1:14:26] come at you a little bit different than
[1:14:28] they did us because we didn't have
[1:14:29] Internet's and all this other stuff but
[1:14:31] we had the same thing you had but we
[1:14:33] could do it in secret now it's all open
[1:14:41] same way with us we've talked about this
[1:14:43] coronavirus me and brother Joe worth it
[1:14:45] you hear of all these other viruses a
[1:14:47] long time ago and you didn't hear much
[1:14:50] now with social media as soon as they
[1:14:52] hit China hit the whole world so it made
[1:14:54] the whole world upset so everybody wash
[1:14:57] your hands
[1:15:09] a great plague in the land washing in
[1:15:17] listen his fear folks fear look land was
[1:15:27] not able to bear him there was a strife
[1:15:29] verse 8 we are brethren verse 9 Abram
[1:15:34] was looking I may not get to all of it
[1:15:37] that's ok
[1:15:38] Abram was looking at the same land what
[1:15:41] was looking at but Abram had enough
[1:15:47] sense
[1:15:48] I say God since because he you have you
[1:15:51] can you contract a guard sense even in
[1:15:55] justification because you're heading
[1:15:56] towards something ok so you have a God
[1:15:59] sense or a God direction so he said and
[1:16:03] you know you don't hear Abram crying I
[1:16:05] wanted that no he said lot you picked
[1:16:09] them but you pick whatever you want I'll
[1:16:10] go in this other direction that's why
[1:16:12] they call it repentance I'm going this
[1:16:15] way
[1:16:15] lot you go that way and that's what
[1:16:19] happened look a lot lifted up his eyes
[1:16:21] all the plains of Jordan and it was
[1:16:23] plenty of beer joints and you understand
[1:16:26] what I'm saying that's what was pulling
[1:16:28] light that wasn't what was pulling Abram
[1:16:31] it was pulling lot back into it because
[1:16:34] look the journey of light is a journey
[1:16:36] of someone else besides Abraham look
[1:16:42] what happened a lot in his he's got a
[1:16:45] pretty brother branham calls it a hair
[1:16:47] in the biskits lineage because he had
[1:16:49] relations with his two daughters and had
[1:16:51] mobitz and he said they were here in the
[1:16:53] biscuit you know what that is a gaggy
[1:16:55] thing he said I'm just telling you what
[1:16:57] brother Brown so you know what he said
[1:16:58] brother right he's the gay they did a
[1:17:00] gag I know brother raised her read it
[1:17:02] before lot lift this up his eyes have
[1:17:04] beheld all the plain of Jordan it was
[1:17:06] well watered everywhere before the Lord
[1:17:08] destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the
[1:17:10] Garden of the Lord like the land of
[1:17:12] Egypt it's now coming son to the door
[1:17:13] then a lot chose him all the plains of
[1:17:16] Jordan and lot journeyed East and they
[1:17:18] separated himself one from another and
[1:17:20] Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan
[1:17:23] last word God told him to go and lock
[1:17:27] dwelled in the cities of the plain and
[1:17:28] pitched his tent towards Sodom but the
[1:17:31] men of Sodom were wicked and sinners
[1:17:32] before the Lord exceedingly and the Lord
[1:17:34] said unto Abram after that lot will set
[1:17:36] book the God God started talking a
[1:17:39] little bit more serious to Abram when a
[1:17:41] lot left him now God talked to him but
[1:17:44] listen when listen even in your journey
[1:17:46] and you take your journey you start
[1:17:49] getting rid of all that you did the
[1:17:50] things I used to do I don't do them no
[1:17:52] more I don't go listen to this kind of
[1:17:54] music anymore I don't go visit that
[1:17:56] friend anymore
[1:17:57] I don't crawl out my window so I can go
[1:17:59] party at night a long time ago right
[1:18:09] we've all done these things but we don't
[1:18:12] do it no more we come to a place where
[1:18:14] we don't do that anymore
[1:18:15] we've separated ourselves from that what
[1:18:20] is not important anymore
[1:18:22] Abram thought what was important because
[1:18:25] he brought with him he thinks wow you
[1:18:29] know you want in a right day you want to
[1:18:31] save everybody listen when you come into
[1:18:33] this fellowship of God and you come into
[1:18:36] this place I'm back here so y'all won't
[1:18:38] fall asleep anymore
[1:18:39] I'm telling him I've been fasting during
[1:18:42] the middle of the day and I'm feeling so
[1:18:43] much better feeling so much better
[1:18:46] talking about them brother Branham used
[1:18:51] to do that he's stopping his sermons
[1:18:52] start singing song what's problem in it
[1:18:55] but look we come to a place in
[1:18:57] justifications where we have to see that
[1:18:59] those things that we thought we could
[1:19:02] bring with us you can't bring them
[1:19:04] anymore you know I'm sure that guy was
[1:19:07] the same way man come to church women
[1:19:10] you can hunt Monday through Saturday but
[1:19:12] if you'll just come to church with me
[1:19:13] one time no Lord says no I think I'm
[1:19:17] gonna go back to what I was doing
[1:19:18] I like that greener pasture it looks
[1:19:21] better it feels better I don't have to
[1:19:24] come under conviction Yeah right come
[1:19:29] into the house of God this is a sin
[1:19:31] killing place amen and the Lord centered
[1:19:36] Abram after the
[1:19:36] after that lot was separated from me
[1:19:38] lift up now thine eyes and look from the
[1:19:42] place where thou art northward now look
[1:19:44] you would think God would not tell him
[1:19:47] to look eastward because if you look up
[1:19:49] here in the scripture before lot went
[1:19:51] toward these so you would have thought
[1:19:53] well that's Lots land no God owns it all
[1:19:59] and he's gonna give it Abram all of it
[1:20:02] he's not hearing even listen this is
[1:20:04] what God said God said I don't care for
[1:20:06] a lot when he's not a son and daughter
[1:20:09] of God he's gonna go to Sodom I know he
[1:20:13] is but I know you're not because the
[1:20:17] Lord said unto Abram after a lot left
[1:20:19] him lift up your eyes and look north
[1:20:21] south east and west for all the land
[1:20:24] which thou sayeth now April sitting
[1:20:26] there going their God the green pastures
[1:20:30] of Jordan and those two beautiful cities
[1:20:33] now you give them to what God's like
[1:20:37] temporarily temporarily because your
[1:20:41] friends in the world have a temporary
[1:20:42] place to live you and I don't have a
[1:20:44] temporary place to live we have a
[1:20:47] permanent place to live and it's right
[1:20:50] here when you look north when you look
[1:20:51] south you look east and west Abraham for
[1:20:56] the land which thou seest to thee will I
[1:21:00] give it and to thy seed forever and I
[1:21:05] will make thy seed as the dust of the
[1:21:06] earth he's 75 years old only have one
[1:21:10] child looks like he's getting a little
[1:21:12] late in life but you know what he
[1:21:16] believed
[1:21:17] Abram it was a believer that's why God
[1:21:20] picked Abram because he knew Abraham
[1:21:23] would believe it and I will make thy
[1:21:26] seed as the dust of the earth so that if
[1:21:27] a man can number the dust of the earth
[1:21:29] then shall thy seed also be numbered
[1:21:31] arise walk through the land in the
[1:21:38] length of it in the breadth of it for I
[1:21:39] will give it unto thee and Abram removed
[1:21:44] his tent and came and dwelt in the
[1:21:45] plains of Mamre which is in Hebron and
[1:21:48] built a builded altars a
[1:21:50] from faithful he goes Church he does
[1:21:54] what God tells him to do
[1:21:56] now Genesis 14 we'll see what happened
[1:22:00] in Genesis 14 real quick you don't even
[1:22:04] have to put it up before what happened
[1:22:05] was Locke got in trouble now look your
[1:22:10] friends may get in trouble out in the
[1:22:11] world it's okay to go help them but
[1:22:16] folks listen it's always gonna be on
[1:22:20] Sunday or Wednesday evening now that's
[1:22:29] that's not your friend's fault
[1:22:31] that's the devil testing you but Abram
[1:22:40] finally found a place to go out and help
[1:22:41] his brother life but remember what
[1:22:44] happened what happened he didn't go out
[1:22:47] with lot and stay there
[1:22:50] the Bible says coming back from the
[1:22:53] slaughter of the king coming back from
[1:22:57] the slaughter of the king he was met by
[1:23:00] Melchizedek somewhere in your journey

[1:23:29] priest to walk out of the woods no
[1:23:31] you're looking for God in human flesh
[1:23:33] that's what Abram and Abram met God in
[1:23:36] human flesh and he blessed him and said
[1:23:39] blessed be Abram blessed be that black
[1:23:43] he had started a journey then I've been
[1:23:48] wanting him to be over a long time same
[1:23:50] with me and all of us possessor of
[1:23:58] heaven and earth the Bible fair
[1:24:01] verse 19 and blessed be the Most High
[1:24:05] God which that delivered thine enemies
[1:24:06] into thy hands and he gave him tithes of
[1:24:09] all in your journey you're gonna come to
[1:24:12] a place to where you're gonna start
[1:24:13] doing things of God and you're gonna get
[1:24:16] closer and your walks gonna get closer
[1:24:18] you walk can't get further away your
[1:24:21] walks got to get closer and closer and
[1:24:24] closer amen now let's go before we go to
[1:24:27] Genesis 15 let's read a few scriptures
[1:24:29] let's go to Roman's 3 now you can go
[1:24:30] back to the I hope somebody's back there
[1:24:39] I looked in Anderson sitting here yeah
[1:24:42] go back you're good we got time
[1:24:44] Romans 3 verse 24 through 26 and then
[1:24:55] Romans 3 verse 24 through 26 being
[1:25:02] justified nope you got to go back to
[1:25:06] where it says justification on my note
[1:25:08] big words and justifications in Genesis
[1:25:10] 12 it's a it's Romans 3 verse 24 right
[1:25:15] up it the first right after brother
[1:25:16] Branham talks on who is this Melchizedek
[1:25:18] and didn't read this one but you should
[1:25:20] know it there you go
[1:25:21] that brother brown said every son of the
[1:25:23] faith that comes to this through this
[1:25:25] journey has to walk this you have to
[1:25:29] walk this same journey of Abraham that's
[1:25:31] why he was our example in hood this milk
[1:25:34] hesitate paragraph 65 he said every son
[1:25:37] of the faith will absolutely do the same
[1:25:39] thing Abraham did you'll go through
[1:25:41] justification sanctification baptism the
[1:25:43] Holy Ghost meet God take communion and
[1:25:47] then along in your life you're going to
[1:25:50] be tested which I'm about adoption next
[1:25:53] next month on the Bible study in
[1:25:55] adoption God took Abraham to a place and
[1:25:58] said sacrifice your son all that I'll
[1:26:02] give you kill it and Abraham walked
[1:26:07] right up and was getting ready he was
[1:26:08] gonna absolutely cut the throat of his
[1:26:10] of his only son and God stopped him he
[1:26:13] said oh I know you're in a position
[1:26:14] now that I can deal with you same way
[1:26:18] with you and I but you got to go through
[1:26:19] justification now he didn't send him he
[1:26:22] didn't send Isaac in justification in
[1:26:25] the first part of this journey listen in
[1:26:27] the first part of his journey he
[1:26:28] absolutely knew that God said you're
[1:26:30] blessed God said I'm gonna give you this
[1:26:32] I'm gonna give you that but didn't tell
[1:26:33] him how he never said now your name is
[1:26:37] gonna be changed Sarah is gonna be
[1:26:39] changed to Sarah and you're gonna have
[1:26:40] it to her because remember in
[1:26:41] sanctification he makes a bad mistake he
[1:26:49] thinks Hagar can do it and Hagar is
[1:26:52] outside of the plant what she's in the
[1:26:54] plan but she's outside of the real plan
[1:26:56] Isaac was not gonna come through her he
[1:26:59] was gonna come through the free woman
[1:27:00] not the bondwoman alright we'll talk
[1:27:03] about that later on but let's get this
[1:27:04] right here and then we'll stop lord of
[1:27:08] mercy well maybe we'll do sanctification
[1:27:10] this afternoon romans 3 verse 24 i hope
[1:27:13] it's not born you cuz you know what it
[1:27:15] even revives what's in me we want to go
[1:27:17] through the revival then you sit down
[1:27:20] and think about Abram and think about
[1:27:21] Abraham when you think about all these
[1:27:23] people that went through these journey
[1:27:24] didn't even have the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:26] Ghost yet they did what God said the
[1:27:30] Bible tells us being justified freely by
[1:27:33] His grace through the redemption that is
[1:27:35] in Christ Jesus whom God has set for it
[1:27:38] to be a perpetuation through faith in
[1:27:40] his blood the faith of Abraham to
[1:27:45] declare his righteousness not your own
[1:27:49] for the remission of sins that are past
[1:27:52] remember Grace's for what you did no
[1:27:54] what you're gonna do there is no grace
[1:27:57] for what you're going to do you need
[1:28:00] grace for what you did hey man grace is
[1:28:04] not for futures for past sins through
[1:28:07] the forbearance of God to declare I say
[1:28:10] at this time his righteousness that he
[1:28:14] might be just and the justifier of him
[1:28:18] which believeth in Jesus he's a just and
[1:28:25] the justifier of him who him
[1:28:27] this guy which believeth in Jesus all
[1:28:31] right let's go to Ezekiel we're going to
[1:28:33] read this and then we'll talk just about
[1:28:35] five minutes on sanctification then
[1:28:38] that's what we'll start this afternoon
[1:28:39] therefore say this is EQ 11 through 17
[1:28:43] through 19 thus saith the Lord I will
[1:28:46] even gather you from the people now
[1:28:47] what's he doing he's taking he's taking
[1:28:49] Abram out he's gathering him from the
[1:28:51] people he was in he's gathering you from
[1:28:55] the world
[1:28:56] listen worse we have to be a separated
[1:28:59] people
[1:29:00] I will even gather you from the people
[1:29:03] and assemble you out of the countries
[1:29:06] where you been scattered and I will give
[1:29:10] you the land of Israel and they shall
[1:29:13] come thither and they shall take away
[1:29:15] all the detestable things thereof did
[1:29:17] God not take the detestable things away
[1:29:19] from you he sure did me you look back
[1:29:23] and see the things y'all used to do and
[1:29:25] I used to do and we all used to do their
[1:29:27] detestable I told God yesterday I said I
[1:29:31] sure hate that I think that that I can
[1:29:34] remember what I did you know what he
[1:29:36] said I don't that's how he can be the
[1:29:42] justifier he can't justify you if he can
[1:29:44] remember what you did simple as that
[1:29:48] but how profound and they shall consider
[1:29:51] and shall take away all the detestable
[1:29:53] things thereof and all the abominations
[1:29:55] there are for what the land this land
[1:29:58] and I will give them one heart listen
[1:30:02] there's only one your birth there's only
[1:30:05] one journey of a new born again
[1:30:06] Christian that's true justification
[1:30:08] sanctification in the baptism of the
[1:30:10] Holy Ghost and I will give them one
[1:30:12] heart and I will put a new spirit within
[1:30:14] you now look we're heading toward
[1:30:15] sanctification that's not in
[1:30:17] justification justification is this
[1:30:19] right here I will take the stony heart
[1:30:21] out of your flesh and I will give you a
[1:30:22] heart of flesh he is taking you on a
[1:30:25] journey to sanctification
[1:30:28] because what is sanctification cleaned
[1:30:30] and set aside for service right cleaned
[1:30:35] and set aside for service everybody got
[1:30:37] that say a man and then we look in
[1:30:40] chapter
[1:30:41] don't put anything up tonight this
[1:30:42] afternoon in Chapter 15 and 16 is
[1:30:48] sanctification
[1:30:49] the Bible says after these things the
[1:30:51] word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a
[1:30:53] vision he's getting closer
[1:30:58] you never ever say a vision in Abram
[1:31:03] during justification but when you head
[1:31:05] into sanctification
[1:31:06] the Bible says I'll give you a new
[1:31:07] spirit and remember it's not the Holy
[1:31:10] Spirit the Bible in brother Ram tells
[1:31:13] you there's a spirit that you can deal
[1:31:16] with that God can deal with listen God
[1:31:19] can't deal with you and justification he
[1:31:21] really didn't deal with Abraham he just
[1:31:22] kind of guided him you see all the
[1:31:24] mistakes Abram ate
[1:31:25] God didn't guide him into Egypt he left
[1:31:27] to win himself same way with you and I
[1:31:29] you know you you get you can be
[1:31:31] justified and leave and come back cuz
[1:31:35] remember that's the very outer core you
[1:31:37] can walk out of the court you can walk
[1:31:39] back in the court but remember that
[1:31:42] journey has got to take you to the next
[1:31:44] step or you're not Abram all right it's
[1:31:48] got to take you to the next step but
[1:31:50] remember sanctification is a work of the
[1:31:54] Holy Spirit and it's a washing of the
[1:31:56] water of the word remember the unclean
[1:31:58] spirit goes out we'll talk about this
[1:31:59] afternoon just kind of give you a little
[1:32:01] something but I want to say something
[1:32:02] real quick about this journey when we
[1:32:06] head into st. duplication real quick
[1:32:08] hey all right I've never thought about
[1:32:11] this I was thinking yesterday too after
[1:32:15] the Lord had impressed on me about that
[1:32:18] you ever realize the Bible tells us and
[1:32:22] we'll read them this afternoon but I
[1:32:24] want to read them now Psalm 68 19 says
[1:32:26] blessed be the Lord who daily load with
[1:32:29] us with benefits
[1:32:31] daily loaded not loathe load like to
[1:32:36] load you up Psalm 103 to bless the Lord
[1:32:41] O my soul and forget not all his
[1:32:43] benefits
[1:32:45] what shall I render unto the Lord Psalm
[1:32:47] 116 12 what shall i render unto the Lord
[1:32:50] for all his benefits toward me and the
[1:32:54] scripture says
[1:32:55] that I can be saved in other words by
[1:32:57] the salvation of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:59] but look at the benefits you ever
[1:33:00] thought about this we look at disease in
[1:33:03] affliction brother Joe and I were
[1:33:04] talking about this a few minutes ago you
[1:33:05] look in the Bible in the Bible in an Old
[1:33:08] Testament they would be a plague go
[1:33:11] through the land and it would kill so
[1:33:13] many thousand people but remember it was
[1:33:15] always after they disobeyed God always
[1:33:21] after they disobeyed God there'd be a
[1:33:23] plague go through Aaron road run through
[1:33:25] with the century but by the time Aaron
[1:33:26] got finished they'd be six thousand
[1:33:28] eight thousand thirty thousand twenty
[1:33:30] thousand people would die what was God
[1:33:33] doing you think all them people were
[1:33:35] good people no they were the bad ones
[1:33:38] God don't clean the earth of good people
[1:33:41] he claims the earth the bad people don't
[1:33:43] remember God - just God and being just
[1:33:46] he has to have justice but you think
[1:33:50] about diseases and afflictions now I'm
[1:33:52] not talking about just for about five
[1:33:53] minutes just us we're just here talking
[1:33:55] this is the journey of a believer and I
[1:33:57] believe we got the benefits and we've
[1:33:59] got the promises now you take somebody
[1:34:01] like brother Dale that had something
[1:34:02] done on the shoulder that's not a
[1:34:03] disease that's the cause of the fall and
[1:34:08] what's causing the fall me and Jim we
[1:34:10] talked about this the other day what's
[1:34:11] causing the fall what we eat God curse
[1:34:16] the ground and everything we eat won't
[1:34:19] tell us a hundred times in his message
[1:34:21] our food is killing us okay so an
[1:34:26] affliction or you got this or you got
[1:34:28] you know something I'm talking about a
[1:34:30] disease a communicable disease that can
[1:34:33] go from one person to the next like
[1:34:35] we're talking about the corona virus or
[1:34:36] whatever but do you know if you're a
[1:34:38] born-again Christian today the Bible
[1:34:43] says you're clean it's all that's the
[1:34:46] soul well in the Bible in the Old
[1:34:50] Testament it told people hey if you find
[1:34:53] a dead body and you touch that dead body
[1:34:55] what does it tell you to do wash not
[1:34:59] because God said so because God was
[1:35:00] trying to protect the people he said go
[1:35:02] wash and and don't do anything until
[1:35:04] evening why he was letting that disease
[1:35:07] out of there cuz he knew we'd have them
[1:35:10] but listen to this
[1:35:12] I just wrote some of these down you know
[1:35:14] if you're a born-again Christian and you
[1:35:16] save yourself young people listen to me
[1:35:21] are you listening to me how vital it is
[1:35:26] to keep yourself before marriage because
[1:35:33] communicable diseases come from sex
[1:35:36] outside of marriage period right so if
[1:35:43] you're a pure man and a pure woman and
[1:35:44] you get mad never have to go to a clinic
[1:35:49] never have an unwanted pregnancy I'm
[1:35:53] just talking I'm just telling you what
[1:35:54] is our benefit of being a born again I
[1:35:57] said born-again Christian all
[1:36:02] communicable diseases will be gone if
[1:36:07] you don't smoke or drink or anything
[1:36:12] like that all those diseases that come
[1:36:18] with that they go away all right
[1:36:25] why do people have liver disease they
[1:36:28] drink okay now they may be things listen
[1:36:32] they may be cases you say in your merry
[1:36:34] life no I'm talking about overall
[1:36:36] children of Israel two million people
[1:36:38] plus the mixed multitude when into Egypt
[1:36:41] and the Bible says it wasn't a feeble
[1:36:43] man among them that they did not CVS and
[1:36:45] Walmart going with them I'm like brother
[1:36:51] Branham I'd like to know what Moses had
[1:36:53] in that script bag that was on his side
[1:36:54] you know what he had he had God he told
[1:36:59] the people he said if you won't read the
[1:37:02] Bible if you do anything unclean don't
[1:37:05] wash this is not an old theory go wash
[1:37:08] and separate yourself for a little while
[1:37:10] what to get that disease out of there
[1:37:14] there'd be no divorce court
[1:37:19] divorce lawyers would have to instead of
[1:37:23] playing golf they'd have to be the golf
[1:37:24] graham keeper no abortion clinics you
[1:37:29] see what you as a Christian and you as
[1:37:30] young adults
[1:37:31] I value any person that saves themself
[1:37:35] all of us did it have scars before yeah
[1:37:39] go ahead
[1:37:40] give yourself all of us it all people
[1:37:42] that have scars before you can tell the
[1:37:44] people it's not worth it it's not worth
[1:37:48] it for the moment sin may be worth it
[1:37:52] you may think it's not worth it
[1:37:56] you can look I made a whole list I'm not
[1:37:59] gonna read a monk of this 1146 that
[1:38:01] atomic clock but most viruses and all a
[1:38:06] lot of anything that is communicable if
[1:38:10] you're a born-again Christian think
[1:38:12] about how clean you are today so I say
[1:38:14] think about how clean yard just by being
[1:38:15] a born-again Christian you come in here
[1:38:17] you don't have smoke all over you you
[1:38:18] don't have to go home and you and you
[1:38:20] know you breathing smoke which what it
[1:38:22] messes you lungs up and then you're
[1:38:25] susceptible for what it's just a
[1:38:27] snowball effect you're susceptible for
[1:38:28] other diseases and your death and your
[1:38:30] that it goes on and on heart disease and
[1:38:32] all these different things but if you're
[1:38:34] a born-again Christian today look that's
[1:38:37] why I said he loaded us with benefits
[1:38:42] that the world is out there going crazy
[1:38:45] at the moment because they don't
[1:38:48] understand and they're afraid by
[1:38:51] touching somebody's nose or face or or
[1:38:53] you didn't wash your and not don't
[1:38:59] forget not as benefits now listen we all
[1:39:01] got scars we all got problems we all got
[1:39:03] things but listen if you're born again
[1:39:05] today
[1:39:05] you're the cleanest people on the face
[1:39:08] of the earth
[1:39:09] and if you're not born again and you
[1:39:12] have those scars you know what God can
[1:39:14] clean you up there is no sin except
[1:39:18] blasphemy that God can't save I think
[1:39:21] about that Georgia car tonight Jordan
[1:39:22] Carter was one that was the drunk
[1:39:24] somebody help me Rosella thank you I
[1:39:26] knew Paul Harvey you know
[1:39:28] Rosella Rosella a Street prostitute an
[1:39:35] alcoholic and you know what all that
[1:39:36] went with it
[1:39:37] brother Brown says now she's a clean
[1:39:39] woman now sure you got all that in the
[1:39:42] past that she may have to deal with but
[1:39:46] if you'll believe what God said the
[1:39:48] things I used to do I'd do them no more
[1:39:51] because God would put them in the sea of
[1:39:53] God's forgetfulness let's stand to our
[1:39:55] feet musicians come but you're clean
[1:39:59] Jesus even told me not for me said
[1:40:01] you're clean but not all why because one
[1:40:04] man wasn't the look folks no amount of
[1:40:08] water though it's gonna wash an evil
[1:40:10] spirit off of you
[1:40:11] okay now regular water may keep you from
[1:40:14] getting communicable diseases and
[1:40:16] viruses and all these different things
[1:40:17] but the greatest virus in the world is
[1:40:19] the one that comes from the inside told
[1:40:22] it will infect you and affect you if
[1:40:29] you're not born again you're not under
[1:40:30] that protection you're susceptible to
[1:40:33] everything when Locke went down to Sodom
[1:40:36] Lord look what he look what he he tried
[1:40:39] to give us two daughters away to save
[1:40:40] his skin and to save those two
[1:40:42] messengers that were down there he
[1:40:44] actually was gonna let them be
[1:40:46] fornicated with with these men and women
[1:40:48] to save his self and the Angels because
[1:40:52] he had put himself in that position you
[1:40:54] never see Abram or Abraham having to
[1:40:56] make that kind of a decision why because
[1:40:59] he was under the promises of God he was
[1:41:01] under the benefits of God and you and I
[1:41:04] are not under it listen I like what
[1:41:06] Brunel said one time God's not obligated
[1:41:08] to keep the devil's children clean he's
[1:41:11] not obligated to sell say the devil's
[1:41:13] killed kids and he's not obligated to
[1:41:16] adopt the devil's kid cuz they're the
[1:41:18] devil's kids but we have been
[1:41:20] transferred by
[1:41:22] the power of God from the devil's
[1:41:24] children to the children of the Almighty
[1:41:27] God so we live under his benefits we
[1:41:29] live under his promises we're going to
[1:41:31] look at Abram that's going to be changed
[1:41:33] to Abraham and watch how close God gets
[1:41:36] to him we'll see that this afternoon
[1:41:38] listen we need to walk closer with God
[1:41:40] then we've ever walked before and we'll
[1:41:45] read will start in sanctification and
[1:41:47] we'll start in chapter 15 of the book of

[1:45:50] depart from me you weren't my children
[1:45:53] even though they called on the name but
[1:45:55] the power in the name is what you got
[1:45:57] inside of you it's the ability this is
[1:46:02] gonna be a little juice everybody go
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:05] where is Jesus now we're all brother
[1:46:12] Brahim told us we're all we're all miss
[1:46:15] Jesus the hope the Bible says all the
[1:46:18] whole family in heaven and earth is
[1:46:20] named Jesus so where's the power at the
[1:46:23] power is and you believe in that you're
[1:46:25] part of it
[1:46:26] and it's not some Jesus over here
[1:46:28] somewhere sitting on the throne back up
[1:46:30] in the seventh dimension and you can't
[1:46:32] get to it I thought he said I'm gonna
[1:46:36] come back and I'm not gonna just be with
[1:46:39] you I'm gonna be in you and there's the
[1:46:42] power you know the disciples were giving
[1:46:46] a little bit of power when Jesus was
[1:46:48] here but it was temporary it was
[1:46:53] temporary power cuz he even give that to
[1:46:55] Judas to do the things you know kind of
[1:46:57] start Devils and preach and all that but
[1:46:59] when he came back on the day of
[1:47:00] Pentecost he took that power and he
[1:47:02] directly put it in 120 people that
[1:47:06] Dunamis power that creative power that
[1:47:10] you and I can lay our hands over and our
[1:47:12] kids can lay our hands on our car on our
[1:47:14] house and say God by the power of Jesus
[1:47:18] Christ
[1:47:19] I claim why do brother mom tell us to
[1:47:22] apply the token the token in the end
[1:47:25] time is the message of the hour but
[1:47:28] where's the message of the hour in books
[1:47:30] and tapes
[1:47:32] that's words on a page and voices going
[1:47:35] out but you and I if that voice comes
[1:47:40] out and it's the same voice brother
[1:47:43] Brown said the same loud voice that said
[1:47:45] Lazarus come forth with one day speak
[1:47:47] when thou Jesus is not gonna be on this
[1:47:48] earth when the resurrection happens
[1:47:51] physically Jesus is not gonna be
[1:47:53] standing on the earth you and I are so
[1:47:56] the voice of the resurrection has got to
[1:47:58] come through you and I let's pray for a
[1:48:00] resurrection we're praying for a revival
[1:48:01] let's pray for a resurrection let's pray
[1:48:03] for God to keep us clean read about the
[1:48:06] benefits and the promises of God reading
[1:48:09] them even in the Old Testament he guided
[1:48:11] those Israelites and kept them clean 2
[1:48:13] million they were in one place for forty
[1:48:17] years and God was always cleaning them
[1:48:21] out he was always keeping everything
[1:48:24] going so you don't think God can take
[1:48:26] care of you yes he can because you and I
[1:48:29] are a son and daughter of God let's bow

[1:48:34] Lord that what we said this morning has
[1:48:36] been pleasing to you Lord I believe you

[1:48:43] revival in my heart Lord to speak about
[1:48:46] this walk of a journey of a believer
[1:48:49] into all the benefits that go with it

[1:49:14] Lord we'll take what you said that will
[1:49:18] forget not your benefits that you'll
[1:49:20] take care of this group of believers and
