Description:
5) 61-0806  THE.SEVENTIETH.WEEK.OF.DANIEL_  JEFFERSONVILLE.IN  DA 89-141  SUNDAY_
«  195       †        A striking statement: From the time God made the promise to Abraham (Don't miss this.)--from the time God made the promise to Abraham, Genesis 12:3, to the time of Christ being rejected in A.D. 33, by the Jews, according to Galatians 3:16 and 17, and according to Usher's (U-s-h-e-r-s) Usher's Chronology of the Hebrews, the power of God was with the Jews exactly 1954 years. God dealt with the Jews 1954 years according to the chronology of the Jews and according to Galatians 3:16 and 17. I got many more Scriptures, but just give that. Then after they rejected Christ, He turned to the Gentiles to take a people for His Name. You want a Scripture on that, the place? Acts 15:14.

«  196       †        Now, counting the time, we find that we have exactly (Listen.) seventeen years left, and we will have the same span of time given to us as God dealing with us in the power of the Holy Spirit since A.D. 33 until 1977, the same span of time of 1954 years. God deals with us the same as He did with the Jews. See? How about that?
Now, mark down in your book a little Scripture here I want to give you. Leviticus 25, begin with the 8th verse. God calls a jubilee every forty-ninth year; the fiftieth year was the jubilee. We know that. We understand that. From the first jubilee of Leviticus 25:8, in 1977 will be the seventieth jubilee, making exactly 3,430 years. Jubilee means the going up, the release.

«  198       †        Did you get that? God has dealt with us exactly the same amount of time that He dealt with the Jews from the time He give Abraham the promise until the rejecting of the Messiah in A.D. 33, was 1954 years. And now, we have seventeen years left. We had about 1930 something years. We got seventeen years left until '77 will be the seventieth jubilee since the beginning of jubilees. And what will it be? Oh, brother. Watch close now. Don't miss it. It'll be the Jubil...

========================================
yeah never forsake you good to be in the house with the lord good to be in the house with lord hey man now you go middle of the week get something out of you push that old devil out get him off of you

if you say stuff like that in the crowd brother don it kind of shames them a little bit you know yeah i do too all right also remember june just called her mom pray that we get her in rehab now in the oaks in gainesville they're talking they were talking about putting her in atlanta and that's too far away for june to have to go so pray that they she's already been in the oaks one time uh when they rehabbed her niece so so they replaced one of her hips on monday and she's had a real tough time june's probably had 10 hours sleep in three days so just um but she sounded okay she said tell everybody hello and just keep praying for that and number one that they'll bring her into the oaks for her rehab this will be a lot closer the oaks is here in gainesville instead of putting her somewhere way down in atlanta where june can't get to her so but good to be in the house of the lord if you got your bibles let's turn to i was telling the brothers in the back you know when you put titles to things and you put them online usually that's it gets a it gets a bigger hit when you when you put something on there you know a little mysterious so we're gonna we're gonna try to tonight speak on something i've never heard anybody speak on before brother dale a little bit but 1977 what was the reason 1977 what was the reason because something did happen in 1977 right exactly but i don't think anybody's really tried to explain it but we've come to place now i think and uh brother bob can tell you and some of the ones brother louise has been down in the sunday school class that uh this old testament has opened up a lot more since we've been going through daniel 70 weeks and it has just absolutely just blown us away the things we found and there's a couple more things brother bob that we found last night that uh you know i said about had a kicking fit sitting in the sitting in the recliner so it's uh it's one of those things that you you sometimes you i told brother claude one time i said brother claude he said well i feel like i hadn't even preached i said you'll get your anointing when you get it fresh when you're studying and god brings something to you brother richard and you can put it down on paper that you know what you're talking about you know that you can get it to the people to me that's the greatest anointing i can feel like i hadn't preached to nobody tonight and and still that anointing that i had i'm depending on that because now it's not on me it's on you it's not on me i'm a servant i serve what you actually want me to preach tonight so and same way with all the other ministers it's not just one it's everybody all right so leviticus 25 verse eight we're going to read this scripture then you can be seated and we're going to read some quotes so just pray for us tonight uh let me tell you uh beforehand that uh we're not trying to set any dates or times or or anything like that but for those of you that's been in the sunday school class downstairs we went through some dates and i believe that we can see the time that we're living in and that we can dig deeper in that onion peel you know you keep peeling the onion back it's the same onion but brother luis you peel another layer off and there's another layer you peel another layer off there's a thin layer you can see that what's going on in the word of god so i know we all have unspoken requests um every time i raise my hand and say god save my children you know it's like uh i was telling somebody sunday they were asking about praying and i said jim said something the other day said we need to pray for our children i said no stop stop brother bryan said you'll pray something off of them that god's put on them you put them in god's hands and if it gets worse brother dale's told us many times we try to reach out and pull them back when we give them to the lord if abraham would have looked at his circumstances through his journey the promise would have never come to pass but brother brown said he looked so far into the future that he could see the baby in his hands so i see my children in church regardless of what it is save my children that's all i can tell you can't say bless your children not if they're out there in the world of sin now if they're in the infinite church full of the holy ghost yeah it will bless you but if you turn them over to god you leave them alone amen if they go through a bad time you're just gonna have to refrain right but you're gonna have to have more faith then really i think than being then the faith you would have to pray for him do you understand what i'm saying because it's easy to pray and say oh lord you know you and brother brown said he said i have to even watch he said if god put something on somebody and i take it off he said i'm in trouble with god so you get more trouble than they do so leave them alone i just say when i you know everybody says somebody says well if you've got any unspoken requests save my children save my children it doesn't matter i want them saved glory i want them saved sanctified and filled with the holy ghost amen so turn them over to god and let it be all right don't hold on to them mama tried to save me for 20 years she couldn't do it god's the only person that can save your soul he's the only one who can save your children's soul so turn him over to god and let him go and believe that that promise like he made to abraham that one day is going to come to pass amen long as there's breath in my body i'm praying for my kids just to be saved save my children then after that god can put the blessings on them i don't have to bless them god's going to bless them out of the scripture by the word of god right okay so let's just just a few things to think about there but let's buy our heads and and speak to the author to heavenly father we pray tonight lord that he would bless us in a special way lord we've come to a place now we're heading toward the end of time and things are getting short but father you told us that you pressurized us especially for this time you put astronauts in space or man put astronauts in space they were pressurized for the job well i believe that we're pressurized for the job tonight i believe we are pressurized for this journey father you've already seen the end so you know what's going to happen but we don't and we have to believe in your word where it says by your stripes were healed that you will be there with your offspring all those great promises that we have lord one day they're gonna come to pass and we're not one to set dates but there will be a day when this thing ends there will be a day when we go in a rapture and we'll be gone out of here in a jubilee our jubilee began at at the day of our pentecost when we received the holy ghost but there's going to be a jubilee of this land where we're all going to be able to rest and not have to worry about the things of the world father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes save the lost blessed ones that are here tonight lord fill them more with the holy ghost let us see more of your word and let all things be done decently and in order for we ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen tell you what i've been enjoying the sunday school now whether y'all watching it or not i mean i just kind of shameful that you can look on youtube and i got 24 views out of 70 of y'all and then i turn over to this guy fishing for some kind of stinking fish and he's got 1850. now boys and girls i ain't i ain't seen that yeah something ain't right donny something right you go on there and it tells you how to put a tells you how to put a cell phone in a in a in a cell phone case 18 000 views yeah and we get 30. yeah tells you what the world's looking for but greater is he is in us glory than he that's in the world leviticus 25 8 we're going to read the scripture sit down we're going to read some quotes and then we're going to go back to this scripture a little bit and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seventh sabbath of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years times 7 is what 49 all right 49 years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month now it gives you a day right and a month amen all right gives you a day and a month and it is the day of atonement everybody see that right it's on the tenth day of the seventh month which is tesry in the which is our october remember their calendar begins in april their religious calendar begins in april listen listen one okay there there so you're in the middle of the year in october here in the day of atonement is everybody all right with that right okay all right so their year is not like our year that this is the this is the fall on the day of atonement all right the 10th day of the seventh month and the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land and to all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man on his unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family in other words the 50th year everything goes to zero there's no rich people in the next year we're all equal amen if you sold a piece of land if you were still alive in that 50th year you got it back everything comes back all right and a jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you you shall not sow or reap that which growth of itself so it's not just for the people it's for the land i told them downstairs this is where man got crop rotation amen in the natural crop you rotate your crops remember way back a long time ago they planted cotton cotton cotton cotton and it burnt the land up and that's why you got these big gullies because of the wash and all that because now they use crop rotation where they rotate the crops in and out they plant peas one year because peas has nitrogen they till them up in the soil and then they plant corn if you plant corn every year it's just going to get smaller and smaller so god knew how to do it before man ever thought about it a jubilee shall that fiftieth be unto you and you shall not sow nor reap that which growth of itself itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of thy vineyard undressed for it is the jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof of the field in the year of this jubilee you shall return every man unto his possession it's just it reckons it right back okay so everybody sit down now we'll get started trying to take my time a little bit here if that's all right because i'm going to read you a few quotes maybe this will help the ones that in the sunday school class but also will help some of you maybe uh kind of skip through the some of the things we've been studying on but we have we have been on daniel 70 weeks now for 20 some odd weeks and man it's been a blessing to me um i thought i thought i knew something about daniel 70 weeks until i got into this and started looking at it in a jewish in a jewish view because remember it is to them the 70 weeks of daniel is not to the gentiles but the 70 weeks of daniel is to the jews and the city the land and it all connects back so we're going to read something to today that that we found last night that really blessed our heart maybe it'll help at least help some of you there in the sunday school class but condemnation by representation let's just read a few of these quotes because look 1977 what was the reason why did brother branham keep repeating 1977 there was 10 times in the message he talked about 1977. now several of them were pertaining to the visions that he had right that's right but there was only there was one time he tied it to a scripture and we just read it leviticus is 25 8. brother brown talks about all these prophecies coming to pass between 1933 when he had divisions in 1977 but he never tied it to the bible until in the 70th week of daniel he tied it into the bible right in leviticus 25 8. is that all right all right so we're going to read a few of them where he didn't but we're going we're going to see that when he comments watch what he says condemnation by representation 1960 11 13. he's talking about divisions let's go on down to where i've got the uh to the highlight because it comes to the very last one he said then i seen the united states as one smoldering burn over place it will be near the end now remember this is 1960 because i'm going to tell you something in a minute and you you catch what he's talking about he talks about 1977 way before that right all right watch then i say in the united states is one smoldering burn over place it will be near the end then i've got in parentheses i predict that this will take place now remember the lord that's what the lord showed but i predict this will take place before 1977. upon this prediction i base because of the on rushing slot that's coming now how fast it's moving how long it'll take till this nation meets this place so he's connecting it back to the seven visions that he had right everybody understand what seven visions are talks about uh mussolini hitler the maganal line or the siegfried line and the different things woman gets to vote woman in the white house are a woman in power and then the smoldering of the united states everybody got that amen are y'all here tonight okay just wondering didn't know somebody just looking maybe just came for entertainment 1960 11 25 conferences number two brother ryan said then i turned to look and i seen the united states with a smoldering something had burned it up and down beneath there i said not in the trance but i predict remember this i guess this is tape too i predict that these things will take place between now 1933 and 1977 which will give us 16 more years if my prediction strikes right from 1960 to 77. all right so now let's go to number three get some of these out of the way because these are the ones he is predicting as he's telling the visions all right the ephesian church age this is in the church age book all right let's just read the uh because watch i want you to hold a point here and hold hold hold it right here now remember this is this is brother branham on the ephesian church age this is what he's talking about after the ephesians churches now he puts it the dates what's the date all the way down all the way down all the way down and at 1906 the laodicean church aid set in everybody got that say amen the odyssey in church a started in 1906 and i don't know when it'll end but i predict it'll be done by 1977. what the loudest in church age exactly all right i predict not the lord told me but i predict now so it's not it's not according to a prophecy it's according to a prediction all right five of those things that come to pass already taken place all right let's go to brother pull up number four this is the layout to see in church age the other one was the ephesian this is the layout of sin now he's in the layout of sin church age so watch we believe that the loudest in church age church started in a.d 1906. i predict now remember predict especially you listening at the tape now remember this is before he preached daniel 70 weeks this is all before right before he preached daniel 70 weeks he's making a prediction all right i don't or he doesn't tie it to anything except the seven visions he didn't put it in the bible yet i don't say it will be but predict that it will end by 1977 that the church will go completely into apostasy and she'll be ousted out of the mouth of god and the second coming or the rapture of the church might come any time now i can miss it a year 20 years so he's really you know everybody's dwelled on 77 but brother branham really never prophesied that 1977 because obviously he'd have been a liar if he did if he prophesied but i want to show you something in just a minute he's talking about 1933 and 77 now let's go to number five which is 1961. this is the 70th week of daniel which is a a very it's very contentious in the message and i hope especially those of you that in the sunday school class know for a surety that there's one week left after the rapture according to the bible and according to the prophet's message there is one week left i don't care who you are and what your name is buddy i'm telling you this thing but now you say well you're just talking about something that's to the jews hang on a minute because brother branham said the jews was our timepiece we can tell time by the jews right all right if we can tell time by the jews there was something given to us to tell us a time because gentiles has no time right time shall be no longer one hand on one hand you know one foot on land one feeling see time should be no longer but in daniel 12 there was one man with one foot away one foot on c with both hands up in the air and it was for a time times and a dividing of time three and a half years all right so you had time here a striking statement now watch he's come now to daniel 70 weeks he's come to the 70th week look most people in the message don't think there's a 70th week it's a half of a 70th week according to the bible there's a week left right okay so brother brahm said face final resting places in the word of god take it back to the word of god always a striking statement now watch he's come to a place where he's in the 70th week he's at the last sermon and god has shown him something because he keeps talking about 77 77 77 77 for the predictions but now watch he's going to take and turn it in put it in scripture put dates and put it in scripture a striking statement from the time god made the promise to abraham don't miss this from a time god made the promise to abraham genesis 12 3 to the time of christ being rejected in a.d now that should be 80 30. we know that we know that if you've been downstairs in a sunday school class we've already proved it that's 80 30. because we're going to go and we're not going to read it tonight but in the seals we went to the seals and brother brown said jesus was killed in 80 30. okay i don't know what god put that in there to blind people i guess it sure has because you got to remember when we get to 1954 years brother branham says there's 1954 years that 3 430 years you can't put it in 80 30. right three you've got gotta have put it in 80 30. all right being rejected by by rejected in 1833 by the jews according to galatians 3 16 17 according to usher's chronology of the hebrews the power of god was with the jews exactly 1954 years god dealt with the jews 1954 years according to chronology of the jews and according to galatians 3 16 17. got many more scriptures now counting the time we find that we have exactly listen 17 years left from 1961 to 77 right because it was preaching 61 he's talking about 1977 17 years left and we will have the same span of time given to us as god dealing with us in the power of the holy spirit since 80 33 to 1977 which is 80 30. the same span of time 1954 years god dealing with us the same as he did with the jews see how about that now mark down in your book a little scripture now what's he doing he's fixing to take you into the bible okay all these others have been predictions and things that he saw we're going to read one in a minute where a long time ago when he said he went to the back of the tabernacle and said he draw the line and said i believe all these things will be finished by 1977. well that was a way long time ago so 1977 has been prevalent in the prophet's message not just recent right okay he's had that number in there but watch when he gets to that 70th week of daniel which is numbers and dates and times he puts it in the bible amen all right now mark down in your book a little scripture here i want to give you leviticus 25 begin with the eighth verse god calls a jubilee every 49 years year the 50th year was the jubilee right we know that we understand that from the first jubilee of leviticus 25 8 in 1977 will be the 70th jubilee making exactly 3 430 years jubilee means to going up the release now somebody add up 1977 because what is the jubilee 50. 50 times 70 is right he says 3 430 right that's what they say is wrong a lot of people but you got to remember let's stop for just a second i've read a lot but a jubilee cycle is seven sevens is 49. your 50th year is not a 50th year your 50th year is the first year of your next 49 year cycle so 70 times 49 3 430 years he was exactly correct he knew what he was talking about because when we say jubilee we automatically think 49 and then a 50. that 50th year was the first year of the next 49 year cycle there was an overlap read your bible it tells you that and what blows my mind is it's it's a blowing of a trumpet on the day of atonement begins to jubilee amen which is the tenth day of the seventh month october it tells you the month and it tells you the day to start your jubilee year okay the words you believe as brother dale said many times means trumpet right the word you believe but it also means i looked it up last night it means the jubilee means ushering in the season of joy ushering in the season of joy wow from what we've been studying it just makes me have a jubilee amen will be the 70th jubilee right now plug this into the computer just real quick and then we're going to we're going to loop back because i want to show you something because watch him down here at the bottom he's going to make a he's going to make a prediction not a prophecy a prediction we've got 17 years left until 77 will be the 70th jubilee now 70th jubilee 70 times 49 3 430 all right since the beginning of jubilees and what will it be oh brother watch close now don't miss it it'll be the jubilee of the going up of the gentile bride and return of christ to the jews with a key point when they go out of bondage now they're not going to go out of bondage till we leave amen they're bound now right remember they're blinded until 144 000 come out they're blinded they're bound but watch 70th jubilee since the beginning of jubilees everybody got that now that jubilee is also means rest or the millennium the jews are looking for a millennium a jubilee year and this was so striking last night i was telling dad mom i went online and was looking at some commentaries whoo yeah thank you i i know it's okay so you don't have to tell me that brother branham read usher he read schmidt uriah smith he read larkin he read he went to the encyclopedia and got this remember he said told brother collins or whoever that was he's a brother i know why you brought those encyclopedias because he read them listen god will give you so much but he expects you to do a little bit right amen so we come to a place the 70th jubilee since the beginning of jubilees and and i tell you what struck my heart was there's no recorded history that the jews ever celebrated a jubilee year right never god told them in leviticus now where was leviticus they were getting ready to go in the promised land right or they were in the journey right they were in the journey god told them he said you we read leviticus 25 8. seven sabbaths you number seven sabbaths 49 years and on that 50th year you give everything back that you bought right a jew ain't going to do that sorry if there's any jewish people online but there's no recorded history i was reading the commentary there was no recorded history anywhere that because remember they were in the wilderness 40 years then they went into the promised land well that was 40 years not 49 they never made it to a jubilee year sure they went through it but they never celebrated a jubilee year they never celebrated that 50 where they give everything back they bought never recorded so god told them and um i found this the other night let's go now to second chronicles god put it in the bible amen he put it in the bible daniel 70 weeks is not just something that we brought up and daniel had this vision and oh gosh this is what's going to happen god already told them exactly we're going to read in chronicles and then we're going to read in leviticus keep reading in the leviticus where god told them what he was going to do in other words this is what he said he said if you won't celebrate the sabbath and if you won't let the land rest i'm going to make it rest guess how long 490 years was daniel 70 weeks 490 years and then that had escaped from the sword carried her away to babylon now this is the dispersion remember israel was dispersed right driven out of the they're driven out of jerusalem and the city was leveled because what is daniel 70 weeks it's calling them back rebuilding the city rebuilding the temple bringing the people in bringing the sacrifices back redeeming the people that's what daniel 9 24 is so it had to be all tore down you can't restore something that's already here you got to restore something that has fallen from here and then they had escaped from the sword carried away to babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of persia to fulfill the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah until the land he drove them out and made that land rest let me tell you something god's going to do what he said he's going to do glory until the land had enjoyed her sabbath he drove him out of the land and let the land sit there but look he won't forget him for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath to fulfill 70 years right that's how many years they were in captivity 70 years exactly remember daniel was 68th year he was getting ready to go out in two years he said god what are we going to do and god told him brother brown said god told him not only what was going to happen he told him all the way to the millennium right because daniel was serious about what he was doing maybe that's our problem we're not serious about what we're doing now in the first year of cyrus king of persia you remember that down in the sun's good class cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord spoken by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying thus saith cyrus king of persia all the kingdoms of the earth had the lord god of heaven given me because they persia ruled the whole whole world but god charged him to build a house in jerusalem which is in judea who is there among you of thee all his people the lord his god be with him and let him go now that was where that nehemiah i mean the ezra comes and says we need to rebuild the city then nehemiah is the one where if you've been studying our our lesson it wasn't the edict from ezra because that was like 5 30 something bc and it don't fit daniel 70 weeks began on 445 bc 445 bc when jeremiah i mean sorry i'm getting ahead of myself when nehemiah finished the wall in 52 days that's when daniel 9 24 says that thy holy city and the walls will be built even in trouble as times all right all right now let's go to that was chronicles let's now go to leviticus leviticus 26. so we went to leviticus 25 talk about 1977 because brother brown tied it back to leviticus 25 8. leviticus 26 32. watch this and i will now look he has finished telling them what he was going to do he told them all the sacrifices he give them all the feast days he told them to to make your sabbath 4 7 7 49 hallow the 50th let the land rest i'll give you three years of plenty all these things but watch he comes to the end and i will bring the land into desolation and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it and i will scatter you among the heathen he's going to he told them in leviticus he told them before they got in the promised land what he was going to do and i will scatter you among the heathen will draw out a sword after you and your land shall be desolate and your city's waste then shall the land enjoy her sabbath judy that's why daniel said in the weeks had to be it's not just that daniel 70 weeks is a historical happening right god said land rest amen and if you don't do it i'm gonna do it that's what god says if you don't do it i'm going to do it then shall the land enjoy her sabbath as long as it lies desolate he knew if those jews stayed in that land they would not hallow that sabbath because they weren't going to give it back so he run him out of the city he run them out of the country then shall the land enjoy her sabbath or as long as it lies desolate and ye be in your enemy's land they were dispersed remember even then shall the land rest and enjoy her sabbath as long as it lies desolate it shall rest because it did not rest in your sabbath they didn't they didn't even hold one sabbath because look because it did not rest in your sabbaths when you dwelt upon it and upon them that are left alive of you i will send a faintness in their heart in the land of their enemies and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them and they shall flee as fleeing from a sword and they shall fall when none pursueth seems like god has just let them go and that's about all he's going to do no no remember israel is god's people amen and they shall fall one upon another as it were before a sword when none pursueth and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies even when jesus was on the earth they were looking for the messiah they were looking for somebody to take over and drive rome out of it out of jerusalem right and you shall perish among the heathen and the land of your enemies shall eat you up a lot of people died not in the promised land amen because of the transgression because watch because remember what is daniel 70 weeks make an end of sin reconciliation for iniquity remember these words because they're going to be in here in just a second and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemy's land and also in the iniquity of their father shall they pine away with them if they shall confess their iniquity glory he's just jumped a long way in his prophecy if they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers and with the trespass which they trespassed against me and that also they have walked contrary unto me and that i also have walked contrary unto hmm them god talking you know and have brought them into the land of their enemies they were dispersed if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled what's brother dale been talking about that ain't a heart right that draws blood that's the center of the person glory shall be humbled and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity right where's the sixth full purpose is to bring the people restore the people and restore the city all right then will i remember my covenant with jacob and also my covenant with isaac and also my covenant with abraham will i remember and i will remember the land that's where people don't understand about daniel 70 weeks it's the people and the city now what does the city sit on land brother brown said the very what about i was telling them at sunscreen class brother brown said the very spot abraham took communion with melchizedek he was looking for a city and it was right up under his feet he said that's where the city is going to come down right where he was standing so the mountain's already underneath there right that's what he said and the land also shall be left of them and shall enjoy her sabbath while she like desolate without them and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity because even because they despise my judgment and because their soul afford my statutes and yet for all that you'd think he just forgot him and let him go brother gary just you know give him the left foot of fellowship you know and yet for all that when they be in the land of their enemy i will not cast them away because you know why he knew they were coming back he knew that he was going to make a promise that he was going to bring them right back into the land and they're there now amen in the 40s they started coming in i will not cast them away neither will i abhor them to destroy them utterly now he destroyed some of them but he's not going to destroy them utterly and to break my covenant with them from the lord like god but i will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors amen whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt in the sight of the heathen that i might be their god i am the capital l rd amen so daniel 70 weeks is not just some happening in history god already spoke about it before daniel remember daniel read books he read jeremiah he read books brother brown said we understand by books right well guess what if i had a message book up here but this is a message quote we know by books amen but what about that god's already told him he said if you won't have a jubilee i'll make you have one right i'm going to let that land rest but we're coming back to a jubilee to where it's going to rest for eternity glory amen it's not going to rest for a while but when it does rest when that millennium it's going to rest for an eternity amen we know the millennium's in time but hey if you make it to the millennium you've made it to eternity amen right okay is everybody all right with that that just thrilled my soul that says find that scripture i'd read it many times before it hadn't even had it underlined but it even tells them for 70 years you're going to be in captivity so i can make this land have some sabbath and they stayed out of land 490 years that's kind of interesting isn't it and then he takes a heathen king cyrus of persia because remember if you'll remember what we were talking about in the sunscreen class those etics had to be written and signed by the king of that land because if you just went over to a place and started building buildings this other king might get mad at you and come over and start a war and destroy your land but if you have that paper that says cyrus sent me to rebuild this city then they were somewhat protected right all right so god knew because see he stirred up cyrus he didn't stir up nehemiah or jeremiah no he already had them they were already in the playing they were already in the play but he had to stir up somebody with power during that time to bring them to a place to where you can say hey i've got protection i can build a city because cyrus told me i could then it went from cyrus to darius and went over to to where nehemiah rebuilt the city we understand that everybody all right say amen all right so 1977 is real significant because brother branham takes it to a scripture all right so taking it to a scripture then i can take it silly old me and we can try to make it work and why in the world would it be the very time that brother brown was preaching daniel 70 weeks and telling us that these things can happen amen these things can happen and the things can uh can be that way because i'm gonna read you a quote here in just a second but we're gonna read one more time with daniel 70 weeks pull up number six because i want to read this again keep it fresh in your mind so we can turn the looks of the united states and here come around and shows and then i predict i never said the lord told me but standing that way here it is standing that morning in the church i said the way progress i got back to the end of the wall this is before this is something he preached before i got back to the wall and run to the other end of the wall and i said the way progress is going on i'll predict that the time i don't know why i'm saying it but i predict that they'll all happen between right now 33 and 77 and not knowing that god knows my heart i never noticed until yesterday that 1977 is the jubilee exactly the same amount of time run out that he gave with israel and everything at the end so we're at and here we are at the end of the age at the coming end of the what so one more time did you say halfway oh oh a week is seven years if y'all didn't know that in the bible week equals seven years not three and a half at the coming in of the 70th week we don't know what time that the church will be gone oh my what can we do friends where are we at so he goes back to 77 is the jubilee now you say oh brother here you're gonna dive in well let's dive on in let's read quote number eight layout of sin church age this is one brother bob keeps in his keeps in his little file and and he plays it every once in a while so we can hear brother ram actually say it all right based on these seven visions along with the rapid change which have swept the world in the last 50 years i predict i do not prophesy that these visions will all come to pass by 1977. and though many may feel that this is an irresponsible statement in view of the fact that jesus said that no man know the day in her hour i still maintain this prediction after 30 years because jesus did not say no man could know the year month or week in which his coming was to be completed year month and week that's getting pretty close danger hours in a week's time that would be a day or an hour but if we can if you can because brother branham he talks about many times in daniel 70 weeks the 70th week the last one he preaches he talks about if we can get this correct we can know the weak exactly we can be close we've already took 77 downstairs as a marker but i want to show you something that happened in 1977 it was before 77 actually that you're not aware of maybe that brother branham um spoke of in the masterpiece in 1964 because you say what happened in what happened in 77 well 77 to me was a marker year but watch put up number nine all right this is the masterpiece we see the day's darkening you see the shadows falling when i predicted just a few more turns of the sun this nation is gone yesterday was the fourth of july this was preached on 705 right yesterday fourth of july thomas jefferson signed the declaration of independence him and the other board that was with him in the liberty bell rang and we declared an independence as a nation according to history there's never been a democracy at any time last over 200 years right and that was 1776. now what's 100 years added to that somebody did somebody graduate 1776 plus uh plus 200 years is what 1976 right okay july the 4th and we're just 11 years left will it make it no right can't see 11 years and if it does it'll break all history yeah all right everybody know what happened before that we're going to read it where i googled it let's go to the next one gerald rudolph ford i didn't know this till yesterday i guess dick some of y'all older ones knew it i was only 14 years old at the time gerald ford's real name was leslie lance king i would have changed it too he was an american politician who served as the 38th president of the united states from when 1974 to 1977. kind of odd prior to this he was the 40th vice president of the united states serving from 1973 until president richard nixon's resignation in 1974. he was the first person appointed the vice presidency under the terms of the 25th amendment if you remember brother dick agnew quit ford came in then nixon quit and they appointed ford president of the united states no vote exactly no vote even now your vice president is going to be appointed right watch following the resignation of a vice president sparrow agnew on october the 10th becoming president upon richard nixon's departure in august 1974 he claimed the distinction as the first and to date the only person to have served as both vice president and president of the united states without being elected to either office your democracy ended right right there exactly there was no man put in there was no man voted in office and by 1977 right we have no democracy right the people were both appointed i didn't know that the vice president was but let's pull up him he is his name is very familiar his name is his name is josiah nelson rockefeller he was the 41st vice president of the united states under president gerald ford after unsuccessfully seeking the republican presidential nomination 1960 64-68 served as vice president for 74-77 under gerald ford ford ascended to the presidency ascended ascended i thought we voted him ascended you know what ascendant is one more time you ascended that means that when queen elizabeth dies her son or whichever one is going to ascend they ain't going to vote him in ford ascended to the presidency following the august 74 resignation of richard nixon over the watergate scandal and ford selected rockefeller right he wasn't even voted brother richard as his replacement only the second vice president to be appointed under the provision of the 25th amendment ford was the first right right there together both of them were put into office with no vote right a democracy is the vote of the people right so brother branham was exactly correct this nation ended before 1977 being a democracy and then who did they vote in a southern baptist jimmy carter and it was horrible i'm not saying jimmy carter was horrible i'm saying he just had a horrible presidency because he's done really good things and he was a devout christian as far as he knew you know as far as he knew still alive still battling cancer but look what happened in 1974 this nation from 74 to 77 had two officials in the white house that never were elected by the people they weren't even elected by the electoral college they were not elected period they ascended i kind of i kind of cringed at that word when it says ascended he ascended to the presidency nobody in history has ever ascended in the united states to a presidency presidency except this situation right here so there is to me now that's not all in 1977 but 1977 ended that era from 74 to 77 it ended the era of the united states being a democracy so brother brown was exactly correct what happened in 1977 when we read it before let's go back again to the 70th week of daniel that's just some little history that i want you to look at because people uh and and i don't want to be yeah i do want to be critical i do want to be critical we had a brother sit right here right about where dick was at no he's probably on the second row i guess wasn't he he stood up and he said i wish somebody would explain 1977 because a lot of people are leaving the message because of that being one of them and other things and he never came back to another minister's meeting and daddy tried to explain in just three minutes about 1977. they're not going to listen because they just you know i i was thinking this morning before i started my mail route and i don't think about much anything except getting the mail in the box during that time but i was thinking i said you know um the jews had a had three accidents right brother i'm talking about the third exodus one two and three well what about in the message we've had three exoduses the first exodus was 1977. there was a lot of people exited the message in 1977. dad was around i don't think brother in the message 77 okay well dad i know for sure brother colley was in 1977 people sent their books back they quit the message i'm not having any more to do with this blah blah blah then i believe the second one was around the year 2000 because a lot of people thought 2000 was going to be it and then they started going now the third exodus is remember that's when they left i'm talking about the the elect left right yeah that's right but now you got to twist it back we're not talking about the elect we're talking about the third exodus now of the people leaving the message and not just not just disappearing they're going out and creating websites and things against the message happy that people are leaving the message happy that they're saving people from the message of the hour this is the last exodus there was three exoduses and i believe there was three x's brother donnie i believe god has narrowed this thing down because it's gonna be a little flock it's not gonna be a bunch it's not gonna be a lot of people it's not gonna be a lot of people but why can't we look at 1977 if brother branham took 1977 and put it in the scripture why can't we look at 1977 just for a minute and see what he was talking about and i'm not trying to interpret anything he said because i want to tell you something brother branham said 1977 will be the 70th jubilee right exactly 70th jubilee making 3 430 years jubilee means the going up are the release everybody got that say amen amen so in 1977 something happened he said that was the 70th jubilee okay now 70 times 7 is 490 that's what the jews have been given for redemption amen listen folks there is no 71st jubilee there is no 71st jubilee 70 jubilees ends it right okay there is no 71st jubilee you can't type it anywhere 70th jubilee you can type it all the way through the bible amen right all right i know some of you kind of got a little upset when we were talking about downstairs but listen if brother i'm not saying we might can know the year the month and the week and that daniel's 70 weeks and that the jews were our timepiece right i think we ought to be able to dig in and and see what god has done if there's no 71st jubilee now brother dale preached this in 1974 right proving by daniel 70 weeks that we could go to the year 2026. you say how did you get that take 1977 and add 49 years to it because if you go to the 50th year it's the 71st jubilee you say oh that's going past god overlaps everything people right god overlaps everything said hey all the scripture god told him it's going to be in bondage 400 years right how long did it take him to come out 430 god give him a little grace i believe god's given us a little grace because brother branham did take us back to one scripture we already read it so let's go back and read again leviticus 25 8. should be the next one josiah who's back there josiah wake up okay thank you i worked that poor boy a couple days ago he did a real good job brother joe was a real good testament that your son worked that he was good he did a good job i didn't have to i didn't have to guide him much and we did a lot of work i'm still sore i can't hardly raise my hands and thou shalt number now brother brown said according to leviticus 25 8. everybody got that amen 25 8. now 25 8 is how much 49 years brother brown said according to leviticus 25 8 it's 400 i mean 49 years seven times seven every seven years as a sabbath right when you numbered seven sabbaths the next year was the 50th jubilee which was the first year of the next 49 cycle they overlap each other did i say overlap if i talked about overlap before he over got overlaps about everything really church ages overlap brother brown said one little age lapped over the other right you know what i call that grace because god could have said 400 years and if they weren't ready in 400 years you're just out but god gave them 430 years god gives us grace to me an overlap is a grace period amen because 1977 was the 70th jubilee amen god could have cut it off right there if he would have went to this scripture right here right because there's your 50. right that would have been it it would have had to took place in 1977 but he put it in leviticus according to leviticus 25 8 which is 49 years plus 1977 it's 20 26 you say well that what are you doing with that we ain't got but 10 years right till we get to 2026. and everybody's going man well just hold on a minute we're not done yet trudy you want to come up here and finish this for me okay we've been through it before but i'm just going to throw this out i'm not saying any dates really i'm not but why would somebody in 1974 preach that we could go to 2026 and not break what brother branham said and everybody calling daddy a fool really under their breath oh 77 is it 2026 my heavens some of them was pretty old in 77 and ain't with us anymore but here we are 10 years from that 1977 meant something glory it was an absolute to me like was talking about downstairs 445 bc boom to me that's a marker that's when daniel 70 weeks began in 445 bc jesus was crucified in 80 30. that's a marker to me amen that fulfilled 69 weeks not 67 and a half right at fulfilled 69 weeks in 80 30. then you had thank god you had 2 000 years of a gap for the gentiles that's what we're setting in right now and there's one week left to finish daniel's 70 weeks right if 69 years is already 69 weeks is already finished and we got seven years left brother dick you got to take seven years off of 2026 because 2026 ends daniel's 70th week you got to back it up seven years to 2019. now it's real striking to me though that and this commentator had a made a good statement he was talking about the book of luke and it really is jesus fulfilled he was around when all these feast days were going on he fulfilled we know the first four but watch what happened in october what happened in october in luke the bible says jesus becoming 30. now listen what is our what is our jubilee what brother dale's talking about our jubilee now is the rest that god promised come to me all you the heavy and heavy laden and i will give you rest we have started our that's why the millennium is not to us the millennium i was thinking about this morning brother homer frazier you all need to pray for him you know a couple years ago he had his leg caught in the tractor he's 80 something years old but they had to cut his leg off well he's in bad shape now real bad shape but i thought god if it hadn't been for the fall homer fraser is not sitting in that wheelchair with no leg his theophany doesn't have a leg missing so which one is greater if we were able to see into that other dimension you see that other leg you say you're stupid well maybe but theophany you can't hurt a theophany of god a theophany of god don't have an arm missing don't have a leg missing this is what this is what mom and daddy gave me and that's what's missing from homer fraser but that's theophany inside that man it's more real than the man sitting there with a leg off if we just realize that people i believe that's when the limbs will be restored and the body change will happen amen i believe that i really believe that but jesus preached the acceptable year of the lord and this commentator tied that into the jubilee because jesus on the day of atonement that's where he was at he was in the temple and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled remember the book of luke said jesus becoming 30. well if he was born in april right if he was born in april and crucified in april but he only but he preached three and a half years october is when he started his ministry october is when he started his harvest in october harvest time in october harvest time we don't harvest in april we plant in april we harvest in october right why do you think the day of atonement october october what day is it the 10th day of october now not exactly the 10th day of our october but the 10th day of their testery or october is the day of atonement now what's going to happen when the two witnesses preach to the 144 000. they're going to see their day of atonement glory yes sir we're not through with the feast days amen now to me 1977 was given for a sign because watch now we can take 1977 and we can say okay it can't go past 2026 or that'll be a 71st jubilee which there is no such thing then we can back it up seven years you say well you're making a prediction i'm just telling you that between now and in 2019 is exactly three and a half years because there's another thing we're going to look at downstairs let me just throw this out because in daniel 9 27 it says that when the that when the man in other words the 927 says he shall make a covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week that's why there's one week left after the rapture people the bible tells us there's one week left and he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week and in the middle of that week he's going to cause the what sacrifice and oblation to cease there's only one time that one priest goes in the holy of holies one time a year right that's at passover so now we got another marker the middle of the week is it passover because when that pope walks in and says no more sacrifices he has desolated that temple they can make no more sacrifices he's desecrated the temple passover back it up three and a half years and go forward three and a half years october 2019. could start the 70th week of daniel and october 2026 could end it year month a week right right you decide what you want to decide right but i'm telling you i'm getting older too brother dick 10 years from now you'll be 90 right you may not know you'll be 90 but we'll know you're 90. if we make it i don't think we're going to make it people i'm telling you the way this thing's going and listen this is going to be a secret catching away it's not going to be we i think sometimes we feel that that we're building up to something when jesus went to calvary it was the greatest time that he'd ever had in his life but it to the outside world it looked like it was the worst right i mean think of a commentary of a man writing a commentary about somebody hanging on the cross and there's people crying and this one and they're running and you know you're right on the banks county news and journal or whatever it is banks county whatever it is yeah whatever it is in the banks county newspaper you know if you're sitting there writing about this guy that's dying on the cross and he's crying and he's screaming and he's asking for uh you know it would look like to me if i read the paper that just some center died they crucified hey they didn't crucify good people they crucified people that done something wrong so whether they knew the history of that man hanging on the cross if they never knew the history of him they just thought he was another center with the other two but that was the finest hour that ever was on the face of the earth but it was the darkest hour for the people around the sun went down that's what i'm saying about you and i if we do better under persecution let it come it's got to happen it's got to happen but 1977 to me was a marker to give us a few more dates to put with daniel 70 weeks just a few another marker that we can put down because i'm telling you there is no 71st jubilee right right there's only 70. if you go 50 more years you put it into a 71st jubilee you've got 49 years to 2026 and that's the date that brother dale came up with but this is the this is the shocker that i found online and then we'll we'll close there's three time periods because there's only remember if you've been studying with me downstairs there's there's so many moon cycles that's what they go by in israel they go by moon cycles they don't go by calendar if they come up to the last month of adar and they're getting ready to go to nissin one and if they look up and they're still a sliver of the moon they add another month of adar 30 more days why because if you the moon i mean the world's tilted you know it's wobbling that's why we have a leap year because see if they didn't do that it'd start pushing all them spring feast would be in the summer and then they'd fall in the winter and they they keep moving like this well they jack it back that one month about every three or four years on the julian calendar but not the the lunar calendar has zero to do with the julian with the uh uh whatever one we go by right the gregorian or the julian or whichever one has nothing to do with it doesn't bob nothing it's moon cycle and there's only three years listen to this there's only three years that there's exactly enough moon cycles because remember if 1260 days is three and a half years they're going to prophesy 1260 days in the midst of the week they're going to be cut off and killed there's 260 more days that's what 2500 and 20 days there's only three time periods now this is online some of you already went to the website online this guy figured it out by moon cycles not by not by calendars but by moon cycles 2 520 days only falls in three years 2014 which is past 2016 which is this year and that one year i just told you 2019. right 2019 plus seven is 20 26 we go right back to the same two days it just keeps bouncing back for that's what i when i looked at on the line i thought why does it keep coming up 2026. and i kept digging and kept digging i knew what brother nell had said about 2026 and i knew how that worked but for somebody to come in and give you a commentary and said there's only three years that you can have exactly 2520 moon cycles days or the of the time 2 520 days which is that seven year period is 2014 2016 and 2019 and it will not happen again for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years you see why i've been digging 2019 means a lot whether we going to rapture or not i don't know but there's one thing for sure brother brown didn't say 1977. just by mistake he brought it into the 70th week of daniel that last seven years 1977 helped us with a marker and it marked a time that we may know the year the month and maybe even the week right so if we're here you know what though i told them downstairs if we're here past 2019 i'll stand right here and i'll tell you i must have got something wrong because 2026 to me ends all 70 there's no other there's no 71st jubilee the jews right now folks are looking for that jubilee they're wanting that jubilee they got to get the messiah here we've already got the messiah here we're already in our jubilee we don't need days and times and seasons glory that's right if you're born again you're already in eternity you're already in that rest that's why brother brian says he said the millennium's not even to us we're there on the honeymoon what it's a rest for that land of israel to thy people and thy holy city we're going to dwell in a literal city because that's what god said in daniel 9 24 he's going to restore a group of people and he's going to restore the city amen and once he restores those two we're going to ride into the millennium we're going to be the anointing to the temple they don't need to be anointed again day of atonement then what do you got after the day of atonement a few days later you got feast tabernacles feast of tabernacles yeah where we going to live right see we're all ready brother ryan said we're feasting under the feast of tabernacles right why because it's god tabernacling human flesh but he has promised israel that he's going to build them a city they're going to build a city and we're going to all dwell in that city it's a literal city john didn't see a figment of his imagination when he saw that city because remember the bible says in isaiah that they shall build and no one else inhabits so somebody's going to build something that's not the future home that's not the future home some of those scriptures you can put together that's not the future home brother branham read the future home he said this city was built by your desire god put that city together and you ain't got to build nothing but the bible says that you'll build because really what you're saying is see i build a house and then i give it to josh and josh gives it or sells it to another the bible says you'll not give it to another you'll build that house and you'll dwell in it for a thousand years then the real city that we're all looking for the real city the one that's built for me is going to come down out of heaven as a bride adorned for a husband what a great time i mean if it makes you scared you need to get in the altar right if it makes you concerned that's okay but if you're just really scared about this then you you know you listen folks regardless of whether i'm right or wrong there's a day when god's gonna come he's not and he's not coming in you know he's not going to come and pick up a few and then come pick up a few more and then come pick up a few more he's coming to pick up one bride and it's going to be on one day that's right right brother brown said between six and nine in the morning he got pretty close he's talking about hours now almost but he didn't pick the hour he said six and nine right see he stayed in the scripture no man know the day or hour he didn't say the rapture going to take place at seven o'clock in the morning he said no some morning between six and nine i believe folks there's going to be a harvest and that harvest is in october november september somewhere in there that's just my thoughts everybody's talking about resurrection in april i thought the bible said that jesus told the angels to go and reap did he not he said separate the tares from the wheat and bring the wheat into my garner well when do you harvest wheat not in april you harvest wheat in october or in this in the fall let me put it that way in the fall of the year so let's stand our feet i hope i haven't made anybody mad amen if i have just get over it because it's just what i believe you know what i i'm not a date setter never have been we've never been one we've never set dates but when you can take a certain marker and you can say hey i think i know that's what that man was talking about and i think brother branham wants us to know he wants us to know why he said in 1977 and then he put it in a scripture now if he would have just said i predict i predict i predict i predict but you come to the 70th week of daniels kind of odd when he started looking at those dates luis he took and put it right into a scripture one scripture leviticus 25 8. exactly seven sevens is 49. so 49 plus 1977 is the year 20 26 or somewhere there about that all right so you decide yeah if you want to stay here to 2026 that's fine with me we'll be having a real birthday party for cletus you'll be knocking almost 100 i know but that's all right she's pretty good shape for for the shape she's in but listen you know what god will take care of people that'll that'll uh be loyal and faithful right right i believe that i believe the bible says when brother dale reads that scripture about um taking the communion a mess where if you take it that it would not discern in the body you could be sick and weakly and sick among you and many sleep i believe you can cut yourself short right look at israel god promised them a promised land he promised them if they would hallow that 50th year that he would make an increase i didn't read the rest of it read that whole chapter he even tells them he said from the sixth year to the eighth year three six six seven eight for three years i'll give you plenty enough to make it to that ninth year right because see you gotta let the land rest for seven you gotta plan on the eighth well you gotta reap later on you can't reap the same time you gotta reap later on so there's a big gap but god said if you'll do what i say he even said in there he said i'll give you rain when you need it glory but they didn't do what he said so god drove them out of the land the denominations didn't do what god said so he drove him out of the land he's taken a people not a denomination and i see this message become denominated so much so much more and more that people are just coming to church just because it's a message church i'll tell you something people we got what we need to get out of here we ain't waiting on nobody else to come back sorry i believe there's enough in here right now to get us out here brother ray don't you rapturing faith lays in these books and tapes that the problem is is we don't get in them enough in them not on them he said it lays in them so we got to get in them i don't want the holy ghost on me that's right i want it in me amen in earth right brother dick in earth as it is in heaven not on own won't get you nowhere end we'll get you in let's sing a song god bless each and every one of you i am thinking of a rapture in that blessed home on high winds [Music] [Music] [Music] hello [Music] here [Music] [Music] our gathering and this one's one i like because the angels never fell the angels that are worshiping god never fell the angels all will listen for they cannot join this song glory they don't know nothing about it bro louise that angel that was with brother branham i was thinking about this the other day now listen let me ask you a question brother brown was the holy ghost field prophet right amen he preached the word of god right god god was speaking through that man right right amen anybody agree amen why do you have to say i'm waiting on him why do you have to say i'm waiting on him remember because he had it was another anointing right that healing anointing come he said okay he's here well i thought he was there the whole time there was just another gear like brother brown said and that's and you say what are you talking about we got the holy ghost don't we but we're not raptured yet but one day we're going to really know he's here and then that's when we go glory because that's your healing healing is temporary that angel would come uh the lord jesus christ would come and heal those people but when they walked out of that away from that anointing brother ramsey some of them would get it back on them before they walked across the platform wow but you can't take a redeemed person and unredeem them there is not you can't take a redeemed person and unredeem him he can't walk off the pull off the platform and lose his holy ghost no he's got it till the day of their redemption and the angels will know nothing about that that angel would come to brother branham he'd say he brother brown said the angel came and showed me this this and this well what was the angel doing the angel wasn't revealing nothing to him oh brother wade no he didn't the angel didn't reveal anything to him an angel cannot reveal anything to you he can bring you a message because remember he's not a child of god you are right oh the great ain't doesn't matter doesn't matter that angel would tell brother brown he said i believe i believe he'd come to say william branham have you read daniel 9 24. yeah i've read 924 have you really read daniel 9 24 how about this scripture have you put this scripture with this one he wasn't revealing anything to brother branham he was bringing it to his attention glory and then the holy ghost inside of william branham would tur bring that through that filter and then it would what it'd click you click the angels all will listen for they cannot join that song when the reading look another ringing [Music] [Applause] [Music] free from all sins oh i will shine and i will see going to redeem our gathering and i like this one too [Music] only the children [Music] from all sins [Music] saints will sing redemption story with their voices clear and strong listen for they cannot join us in the name of the lord jesus christ let it be done amen amen [Music] what are we doing now we're gathering together brother brown said i know where he said around the word of god there is no one geographic place it's the word of god it's the common place for us to be there oh and our gathering and we're gonna have a happy time watch like snow and free from all sins one day it's gonna happen
