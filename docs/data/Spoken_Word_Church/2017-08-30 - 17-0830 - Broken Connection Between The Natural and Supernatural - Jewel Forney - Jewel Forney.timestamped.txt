[4:21] word Lord this evening little thought
[4:24] I've been preaching on and I thought it
[4:27] would be good to share this evening with
[4:29] just you know I'm gonna read from the
[4:32] book of Genesis the fourth chapter and I
[4:36] will read verse three to verse 5 you
[4:39] know I'm so gonna read Romans eight then
[4:40] I'll read verse 9 through verse 11
[4:43] Genesis the fourth chapter beginning at
[4:47] verse 3 it says her program using it
[4:54] then he said but in the process of time
[4:57] it came to pass that Cain brought of the
[5:00] fruit of the ground and offered unto the
[5:03] Lord and Abel he also brought of the
[5:07] firstlings of his flock and of the fat
[5:10] thereof and the Lord had what respect
[5:14] unto Abel and
[5:15] his offering but unto Cain and to his
[5:18] offering he had not respect and K was
[5:22] very rough and his countenance fell let
[5:28] us go to Romans 8
[5:33] Rome is the eighth chapter and I'm read
[5:36] from verse 9 down to verse 11 Paul
[5:40] speaking here he said but ya are not in
[5:45] the flesh but in the spirit if so be
[5:48] that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you
[5:52] now if any man has not the Spirit of
[5:55] Christ he is none of his
[5:56] but if powerful right well then let you
[5:59] know it all go back to God how loose
[6:01] articles in his a anything he goes on in
[6:04] their birthday and he says but if Christ
[6:07] be in you the body is dead because of
[6:10] same but the Spirit is life because of
[6:14] righteousness then he brings the
[6:17] revelation together he said but if the
[6:20] spirit of him I noticed you know that is
[6:23] not them helooo it the spirit of him he
[6:26] say the spirit of him that raised up
[6:29] Jesus from the day telling you he that
[6:34] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[6:36] also quicken your mortal body by his
[6:39] spirit that dwelleth in you praise God
[6:42] let us pray our gracious Father forgive
[6:46] us this day our trespasses and all I say
[6:49] is Oh God
[6:50] many mistakes Lord my father we ask you
[6:52] in the name of Jesus Christ father help
[6:54] us to heal herself to you O God a body
[6:57] soul in a spirit Oh God but I trust God
[7:00] that you helped me to get myself out of
[7:02] the way Lord that you can use my body
[7:04] for your glory but I gotta give you all
[7:06] my scrip for this service in Jesus
[7:08] Christ's name we pray you mean God bless
[7:11] you you may be seated one moment thank
[7:16] the Lord for the reading of the word of
[7:18] God this evening so if we took from the
[7:22] scripture this evening I took from the
[7:25] book of Genesis
[7:26] I deal with two boys going to worship
[7:30] Him one was accepted and the other was
[7:32] rejected ha Luanne and I went to Paul
[7:35] and Paul begin to he did say he's a but
[7:38] he begin to talk about the spirit and
[7:40] the flesh
[7:40] and don't worry beginning to realize let
[7:42] us understand that the flesh is rejected
[7:44] there's no way to meet God in flesh
[7:47] honey you gotta meet God by revelation
[7:50] so I want to take a thought or just
[7:52] evening people start on broken
[7:55] connection between the natural and the
[7:58] supernatural the broken connection
[8:01] between the natural and the supernatural
[8:02] and I looked up a definition for that
[8:05] here disconnect it it means to stop or
[8:09] in or supply of electricity I'll do in
[8:13] other words if a connection were
[8:15] breaking the building the night
[8:16] hallelujah overload and the power the
[8:20] breaker box will automatically cover all
[8:22] the power that might will go out
[8:24] hallelujah the lights will go out got
[8:27] nation and brogre and the building will
[8:29] be powerless hollow that's the same with
[8:32] the Holy Spirit
[8:33] honey if the connection is broke between
[8:36] you and God
[8:37] you'll become powerless it ain't no way
[8:41] for you to in other words there's no
[8:43] power there's no way for you to beat the
[8:45] enemy if the connection is wrong so that
[8:48] what I was dealing with in reason I with
[8:50] the jitters there because what you know
[8:51] we want to go back to Jesus because we
[8:53] would realize when in the beginning God
[8:55] God our God had a connection he made
[8:58] hellooo God created man in his own image
[9:01] created man he male female created he
[9:04] them
[9:05] haloo God put Adam and in other words
[9:08] God when he created us uh I just been
[9:11] her Holly it was uh it was a powerhouse
[9:14] of energy that's when Adam was he was a
[9:18] powerhouse of energy how did I deal with
[9:20] children oh sure and God created him
[9:23] male female created he them
[9:25] halu only is cited item was an invisible
[9:29] union Holly I want you to know in his
[9:31] mind and in his heart was his wife Holly
[9:35] that was so she was
[9:36] mystery that was hidden inside of Adam
[9:39] others I know what you to notice now if
[9:42] you noticed this when Adam was created
[9:44] in the image of God hallelujah
[9:46] anyway incident to the image of God did
[9:49] God took this image and put it behind
[9:51] skin and breathe until he became a
[9:54] living soul
[9:55] hallelujah that word and it became the
[9:58] mystery of God on this earth haloo God
[10:02] gave him supreme deity over there
[10:04] hallelujah God would decrease the
[10:07] Supreme Spirit on the whole universe but
[10:09] Adam had everyday under his power and I
[10:12] want you to notice here I would you know
[10:15] the devil never came to Adam he were too
[10:19] powerful the devil I'm gonna never knew
[10:21] I knew better than to trying to approach
[10:24] Adam because Adam ate enough bow in here
[10:27] to speak him mighty existed how he the
[10:31] devil in that crazy how do you know
[10:34] where he knew he he knew he knew that
[10:36] the poverty was another and he knew it
[10:38] was no way for him to face Adam so he
[10:40] stay here and all the evils that all the
[10:42] time
[10:43] saying it was in the garden entire the
[10:45] whole time because the Bible said in
[10:47] Ezekiel 28 he was down all the time in
[10:50] the garden
[10:50] but in his shorts a stat him the tree in
[10:54] life with the tree of knowledge without
[10:56] all the time and Adam II hit anyway I
[10:59] don't walk that he is supreme deity God
[11:01] let Adam - Adam whatever your thought is
[11:04] you could call it daddy honey what Anna
[11:06] was not speaking his thought he was
[11:08] speaking of mine a Christ
[11:10] every time he named something it was not
[11:13] him speaking it was God using him we
[11:18] begin to look at this deity here we
[11:19] begin to realize her so now and it was
[11:22] so now in the words of God being Adam
[11:24] had a deep culture too deep he created
[11:27] every day in his image at a a male and a
[11:31] female created a rooster head of he
[11:34] created a buck here - no he did not
[11:37] create two roosters
[11:40] hello tooth bumps how did that man the
[11:44] one mess it up not God how did the
[11:47] perversion of his angels what men said
[11:49] of not God
[11:50] huh Luba had male and female honey
[11:54] in the beginning but God here go enemies
[11:56] but she was on the other side of Adam
[11:58] and Adam had a deep culture the deep
[12:01] that one approach that it does a deep
[12:03] call that got to be a deep to respond to
[12:05] that call Adam wanted somebody he could
[12:08] hold their hands and they could walk
[12:10] through the cooler the gun and they can
[12:12] enjoy the paradise of God
[12:14] Hollywood anyway he wanted somebody who
[12:16] sat down in the cool of the day and they
[12:18] could talk about what the father had did
[12:20] he wanted somebody he could help
[12:22] fellowship with how do even though she
[12:24] was on the inside of her but he could
[12:26] not publish your winner hope we would
[12:28] have been low even though the insider
[12:29] because he was there scared and she was
[12:32] invisible in the word with no fishy bit
[12:36] way but he wanted something he could
[12:38] touch her whole head hey know what sit
[12:40] down
[12:40] so God what did God do God put out him
[12:43] in a deep sleep put him in a deep sleep
[12:47] and what did God do when he did God
[12:49] opened up the side of Adam he opened up
[12:53] his side hey God reaching that took a
[12:55] real from on his heart and God took out
[12:58] the feminist spirit hallelu did God
[13:00] closed up the side once God took it out
[13:04] he closed it up hallelu didn't we got
[13:07] closed it up how do we took that real
[13:09] money may hear a woman may be a woman
[13:12] not not naughty that was when she got an
[13:15] independent spirit she did not receive
[13:17] that name she received a new name after
[13:20] she weird name had to see it fell from
[13:22] God but in the beginning she was a
[13:24] missive Adam how loose she was his
[13:27] revelation she will what come out of
[13:29] Adam honey but God close up decided at
[13:32] him why would you know that when we the
[13:35] second Adam God never closed his side up
[13:37] Bobby go we got to come back to him
[13:40] Holly we got to come back to what we
[13:42] fell from hell is Oh God open inside but
[13:45] don't let me
[13:46] here he was so novel a new Adam did it
[13:49] thank God okay goodbye
[13:50] ha Louie Adam says I'm going to call you
[13:53] woman because you too mr. Adam can you
[13:57] my revelation you would come out of me
[14:00] you bone of my bone and you flesh of my
[14:03] flesh huh anyway so further element
[14:06] something now that he he could eager
[14:09] charge he had something he could hold
[14:10] hands with hallelujah something that he
[14:13] could his descendant oh he got brave boy
[14:16] after his kind I lose I'll have had that
[14:18] perfect he had the perfect mate telling
[14:23] me you know I want you to live the
[14:25] problem world Satan was in the garden
[14:28] the whole time but he was a spirit and
[14:31] the spirit is powerless without
[14:34] something a word through say there was
[14:36] in this study because he's a scientist
[14:39] don't forget shame he is a scientist
[14:41] honey when the brothers are and bidding
[14:44] that's dream world what did he see that
[14:46] he's seen scientists mixing up the Word
[14:50] of God how do you double deal today
[14:52] people try to miss the revelation with
[14:55] human understanding it won't work
[14:57] the revelation only had come by God and
[15:00] God alone but then Satan was there all
[15:04] the time as Satan was steady this day
[15:06] now when saves seen his woman he
[15:09] realized that she was a byproduct hello
[15:12] he realized God took her from Adam
[15:14] Island so you notice he never talked to
[15:16] Adam you notice all the time that it was
[15:19] into God he never come madam but all of
[15:22] a sudden here after she come out Satan
[15:25] came to her not Adam
[15:27] honey but would you know him what would
[15:29] you say that you remember say was that
[15:31] all the time but Satan was not a creator
[15:34] to make him a creator you got to give
[15:37] him the same power that God got he had
[15:39] to be same really God he would have to
[15:41] have he would have to be a eternal
[15:43] creature but he know he's not a creator
[15:45] he did not create something as a
[15:50] governor or what God could already
[15:52] create he can use the law
[15:55] Oh God and get results yeah well devil
[15:59] can pay ties and be blessed you can
[16:02] check it every day I don't even only if
[16:04] a man just got enough fame to pay ty he
[16:06] could still drink and smoke and God
[16:08] bless his men got a blender but they
[16:10] told me he go in heaven that mean that
[16:13] he obeyed a lotus in the world and God
[16:16] cannot lie I don't care what you say
[16:20] Cody says her so I'm beginning to
[16:23] realize it as we begin to hear
[16:24] so Satan knew he couldn't create but
[16:27] being a scientist he knew the law of God
[16:30] he knew that God has said every seed
[16:33] might bring for at his kind had ever
[16:36] seen my brain boy at this guy
[16:38] the same God has said that the wheat
[16:42] would grow by the same rain the God also
[16:44] said that the thought of desert would
[16:46] grow by the same rain and they gonna be
[16:48] thrown in the fire burn but the law of
[16:50] God
[16:51] we're braying up the thorn just like it
[16:53] went to eat honey so low that Satan will
[16:56] use it not creative power low uses God
[16:59] love to get what he wants other people
[17:02] we didn't come to church to use go along
[17:04] we come to church to be born again let
[17:07] me pour about the spirit I'm not trying
[17:09] to paint I'm to get a blessing i paint
[17:12] time because the works a so thought I
[17:18] thought they didn't talk about that in
[17:21] your dish you do better so st. says
[17:23] array I can't create he began to study
[17:29] to God and all of a sudden all of a
[17:33] sudden he saw this big burly
[17:35] creature look like the man strong burly
[17:40] Rud he said wall and he's seen as crece
[17:44] says guess what I can use he says
[17:49] remember beasts has no power to reject a
[17:53] demon spirit if they want to enter them
[17:56] pigs had no resistor
[17:58] he's a when Jesus met Legion and under
[18:00] what did that demon said let us go
[18:02] to the peopie permission Jesus let go
[18:05] the peace couldn't say I resist you they
[18:07] can do nothing about it how loose so
[18:10] kawaai they have no soul
[18:12] how do i bestow had to prayer i bestow
[18:15] had to be snow had to be baptized in the
[18:18] name of Jesus Christ I'll do either be
[18:20] Satan knew he could overtake this spirit
[18:22] this beast so Satan says I'm gonna use
[18:25] this big burly thing and he enter right
[18:29] into it because it was so close to me
[18:30] now say knew that he didn't have a soul
[18:35] but he knew if he could put skin on
[18:38] himself he can have a soul honey they
[18:42] were the woman I'd only supplied a body
[18:45] for Jesus
[18:45] she also applied a body for the servant
[18:48] how do you know where he had to come to
[18:50] her that why Christ had to go back and
[18:52] come to her the same way Holly sure did
[18:54] say this is all right if I use if I can
[18:58] enter into this woman I can receive a
[19:00] body and if I get a body after the cat
[19:03] the law of God require me to get a soul
[19:07] he thought that word he thought that
[19:11] would work if he didn't think that the
[19:13] word he came wouldn't be trying to wash
[19:14] it as it came with me bill knows that he
[19:17] thought that was get him back in the
[19:18] presence of God Holly didn't work but he
[19:20] was already a falling demon had he
[19:23] already been excommunicated from the
[19:25] presence of God for eternally separated
[19:27] he totally did
[19:29] there's no way for him to get back to
[19:30] God turn you know this year so what did
[19:34] he do he goes in here and he in turn
[19:36] into this beast now was he internet now
[19:39] I say you know I totally know today I'm
[19:41] pretty today the concept of the world it
[19:44] was just big beautiful snake hanging out
[19:47] of the tree the woman walking up there
[19:49] Big Apple's right there in the stage a
[19:52] baby wouldn't bite of this Apple come on
[19:55] people you you never seen the toughest
[19:56] me come you could teach a pad to talk
[20:00] but you can't teach a pad to reason he
[20:02] only can say what you say Holly don't
[20:04] worry but here go do anyway so now we
[20:07] related we realized this was not a snake
[20:09] that guy that was into that goblin that
[20:12] same with you did it was a alright
[20:14] creature
[20:15] so poster man but without a soul and
[20:18] Satan could not give him a soul go to
[20:20] you now to creator so he looked at this
[20:23] woman he's seen her
[20:24] he says that's a way to get into the
[20:27] human race so he started talking to her
[20:29] he come evening what did he do and he
[20:32] told her part truth and partly how do
[20:36] you never see that way of making so
[20:38] conception is and not that something be
[20:40] uh uh some deceive you in something to
[20:44] deceive people it's almost right Holly
[20:47] it's almost right it looked good and it
[20:50] looked right but it ain't right healthy
[20:52] so sane total all more right which is a
[20:56] lie interpret it almost look good Helena

[29:19] you turn right back to dirt and that
[29:21] dirt was right in the beginning he was
[29:23] something too old a thing that's on
[29:24] earth but you living here huh nothing
[29:26] old dirty do you think about it it was
[29:34] in the beginning in the Earthmen car
[29:36] Holly we cooked in the world we come to
[29:38] the world already on the curse the body
[29:41] was already under curse Helene under

[32:25] earth to beat that God's cold and we had
[32:28] come from here he didn't call them with

[34:31] God was too holy they come down God was
[34:35] so holy you couldn't even touch the
[34:36] mountain right but he needed a way he
[34:39] could feel what we feel
[34:41] how could he feel it and he was that
[34:43] only so the God had to do it himself
[34:46] when he touched the ground
[34:49] do you realize himself the body that he
[34:51] come here would like to be able to feel
[34:53] that crafty brunner he was not he was
[34:57] not born in sin go out the way wheel boy
[35:00] he took I'll say in the cat's let his
[35:02] world upon himself he took it so he
[35:06] could feel what you going that would've
[35:08] dealt with the whole thing for him to do
[35:09] this he cursed her so he could be able
[35:11] to come down because it won't take only
[35:13] thing they can go to hell with singing
[35:15] Hallelujah
[35:16] anyone ever say didn't know he had a
[35:18] trick laid up for him but guys aint go
[35:20] tell the devil every day but when I get
[35:22] doing everything he did he think he
[35:24] gonna win but I wasn't you know he
[35:26] already done lost the war huh he gonna
[35:28] look like he gonna win the war but he's
[35:30] already lost the battle is already won
[35:33] victory is already tough gonna go down
[35:39] here and stuff we realize him that we
[35:42] begin to realize huh
[35:43] so I'm gonna bring it to a point here
[35:45] because I'm gonna want to maybe try to
[35:47] leave bring this out before I leave so
[35:49] now the showdown we want to look at what
[35:51] we live here we realize here how we know
[35:54] which one of the sons of God or not how
[35:56] you know your son of God well I think so
[35:58] daring how you get to be a son of God so
[36:00] the guy has nothing to do with your
[36:02] thinking no way it's got to be a
[36:04] revelation from God how do you got about
[36:06] Revelation you would know where you come
[36:08] from and where you going honey the devil
[36:11] is defeated
[36:12] not by you by your revelation and what
[36:14] covered it up so we begin to realize
[36:17] here I don't know I could write you so
[36:19] many direction I'm jumping I keep going
[36:23] away but let me try to bring you down to
[36:25] the side look at this right here so now
[36:27] so we realized here so Satan moves me in
[36:29] the flesh k became the mystery of Satan
[36:33] revealed when you seen K you see Satan
[36:36] behind skiing he was a revelation
[36:39] but he could be accepted by God
[36:41] hallelujah he was and they were he had a
[36:44] desire to worship a human desire to
[36:47] worship don't please God it's a
[36:49] revelation
[36:50] honey so he had a human desire he tried
[36:53] his best he tried to be a good person he
[36:56] was a good Pharisee he was a good friend
[36:59] see there how about him God knew how to
[37:01] act it out but they didn't know how to
[37:03] worship they didn't know how to tap in
[37:06] and get revelation because revelation
[37:07] was not given by human ability
[37:09] revelation come by us
[37:11] supernatural inside of God he gave it to
[37:14] you you didn't get it on yo so now here
[37:16] he was so we realized and so now it was
[37:19] Godhead to come in and do the same thing
[37:21] same come do flesh by high breeding high
[37:25] breeding hybrid operating means built in
[37:29] the mingling of two different species
[37:32] that's how breathing I said you know we
[37:35] always have read will say a black and
[37:37] white mix inning in this net make hybrid
[37:40] that is not happening that's gorgeous
[37:43] hallelu because if we get with you know
[37:45] how you say any hybrid if it was how
[37:47] breathing how can a black man take his
[37:49] blood and give to white man he be in and
[37:51] white man taking blood but but God hey
[37:54] don't try to say I don't believe
[37:56] probably I put a bounce in here how do
[37:58] the reason I marry black because God
[37:59] made me black
[38:00] how do something I'm gonna saying this
[38:02] but I'm looking at like there some bad
[38:04] brother Toby say if you miss you go
[38:06] straight to hell under that's a lie
[38:08] how do you know every word you might
[38:10] have a little cartridge different but
[38:11] they don't see you the hell how do you
[38:14] show me if that decay Moses inhale
[38:16] Solomon Hill Hollywood you nobody idea
[38:28] huh well hi brady was mixing in Jewish
[38:31] media whether what Cain was have beast
[38:33] and have half human doctor brother say
[38:37] the truth of it he will have humor and
[38:39] Happy's when Mary had Jesus he was all
[38:42] human he loved human but he makes in the
[38:49] human race
[38:50] Holly was it was blessed becoming word
[38:53] and word will be coming slice so we
[38:58] gonna realize here so you needed a body
[39:00] himself so we know the story he needed
[39:04] her body he needed somebody need to
[39:06] manifest himself he'd he's skiing on him
[39:09] so he spoke the word he but realized he
[39:11] would the spoken word not not doing man
[39:14] cuz I he come to the word other he comes
[39:17] supernaturally through the word Holly
[39:18] another word mary had to believe the
[39:20] word to get pregnant
[39:21] Holly you got a bleed
[39:23] to receive the Holy Ghost I leave if I
[39:25] could ever get you to agree with the
[39:27] word it would kill your own nature it's
[39:30] hard the man concept to say this is
[39:33] mainly just look too mysterious no you
[39:35] need to believe it
[39:36] hellooo Gaga if your human mind could
[39:38] tap in on it you wouldn't need
[39:40] revelation honey so now we begin to go
[39:42] live him we realize he's a wild
[39:44] revelation because it's told away
[39:45] it's the only way you could be saved by
[39:47] revelation nor by by he said your new
[39:50] Berfield
[39:50] when you got a real revelation in a new
[39:52] birth here's a reveal to you who Jesus

[40:09] Christ they are trouble with the word
[40:16] you know when you preach that people say
[40:17] will you turn the Prophet down no they
[40:19] probably got himself out of the way so
[40:20] you can see Christ I didn't and now he's
[40:23] the one got out of the way I'm a
[40:24] decrease so he good entry he realized I

[40:30] time because your eyes will be on the
[40:32] best man and you would never see the
[40:34] word praise God somebody getting to

[44:46] laying and he neither sacrifice did he
[44:49] we go on here we begin to look at this
[44:51] thing right here so now this birth was
[44:54] so mysterious it was supernatural
[44:57] it took revelation and received this
[45:00] hallelujah in other words because Satan
[45:03] did not know what God was doing if he
[45:06] wouldn't do what God was gonna say you
[45:09] know he would not know what God was
[45:10] doing because he even put a question in
[45:13] Jones of mine that was not God to put
[45:14] them there Holly Jordan had a problem
[45:17] Joseph says me and she think I'm crazy
[45:21] the young girl to marry me now she got
[45:24] pregnant she goes no no no what I ain't
[45:26] read I'm gonna put away probably I don't
[45:28] want to see them kill her come he knew
[45:29] them Pharisee would have killed her it
[45:31] is I don't want to see them kill me I'm
[45:33] gonna put Mary away probably Holly
[45:35] because she I'm not doing huh I just get
[45:37] except she got pregnant and then she
[45:39] kind of hit me they had a history save
[45:41] the Roman Helen looking she went over
[45:45] got pretty bad rubber but God's angels
[45:48] don't you believe the word son this is
[45:51] the Holy Ghost
[45:52] then what God was talking about when he
[45:54] got those jokes ah you can see it but
[45:56] the devil never saw it that one ever saw
[46:00] this the devil thought they each they
[46:04] just can't be it
[46:05] because he thought if God come you come
[46:08] down he were to come down right no white
[46:11] horses hallelujah come down on white
[46:13] horses hello a band angels around him
[46:17] Satan wow that's him but he didn't come
[46:20] to what he thought it was how you think
[46:22] brother and preacher mr. guy here to
[46:24] reveal the simplicity the simplicity of
[46:26] God they blinded the devil you so much
[46:29] you say how you know you were blind
[46:31] what did is what did his father was say
[46:33] we not be born of fornication they were
[46:35] calling Jesus illegitimate because they
[46:37] could not bleed it was a supernatural
[46:39] child wholly sure he planning to mine at
[46:42] him now make a feint thinking in their
[46:45] mind oh but you think we crazy
[46:47] you think we crazy you and Joey got a
[46:51] little secret that we don't know about
[46:53] we know what it does that some work God
[46:55] he'd the third pool held a guy here what
[46:58] he doesn't got the devil with a knew who
[47:00] he was he wouldn't have never killed him
[47:01] he wouldn't never try to hit his son if
[47:04] Gina would kept living he's ain't gonna
[47:06] give exist if he would only knew who he
[47:11] was
[47:11] Satan had a question don't and still got
[47:14] a question who you is how do you go to
[47:16] question now it's just really the Bride
[47:18] of Christ I see all that mistake I see
[47:21] that they they do but you don't see
[47:23] whether he don't see that your name is
[47:25] written in heaven and to demarcate take
[47:27] that out so you realize here know what
[47:32] you he told Joseph don't you don't you

[47:56] pregnant a boy you better be sure you do
[47:58] it right you bet you got your you gonna
[48:02] get married you better make sure your
[48:03] boyfriend is not living living a real
[48:05] holy lay coming everybody got
[48:06] calculators now she may not be pregnant
[48:11] she have it in June I know something
[48:13] else you ain't getting by the day with
[48:17] it when Gina was come on earth they were
[48:21] trying to do the same man trying to be
[48:23] God they knew that Jojo had Mary Mary
[48:25] yet they was not married so they had
[48:28] added up when she gonna have a baby
[48:30] tonight it just can't be
[48:32] they was not here but they but the point
[48:35] of it was she would tell somebody there
[48:37] is the Challenger King if the only goes
[48:40] over shouting hey man you think we
[48:47] created a holy why y'all people like the
[48:50] way y'all do hell is the Holy Ghost Hey
[48:54] yes so be gone Lagoon the same thought
[48:58] he would so now remember Jesus in ever
[49:02] type ever type if he break one type of
[49:07] being a lamb the whole whole message of
[49:12] the lamb is marked it is no good so ever
[49:16] type had to be a lamb when John man mo
[49:21] not coming in the river
[49:22] he didn't say behold behold the dog he
[49:25] said behold the lamb how they behold the
[49:28] lamb of God to take away the sins of the
[49:30] world he had to be a lamb it had to be
[49:33] washed honey it had to be a purpose
[49:36] sacrifice so say didn't know what he was
[49:39] dogs are bad it was working for the good
[49:43] it looked bad when they with the every
[49:46] house knocking on the door you got any
[49:49] work for us to have this baby never I
[49:52] said nope we ain't Bobby it looks inside
[49:54] when you read in Scripture there was no
[49:56] room for them in here it should have
[49:58] been a room it was God hidden simplicity
[50:00] there was not their repeat
[50:02] yeah God loves seem to put it in their
[50:04] heart not let him come here trying to
[50:07] drive them kind of stable cuz of lamb is
[50:09] in a stable it was God all the time upon
[50:12] his message that would look a few Satan
[50:16] Satan
[50:17] even the king of King born in a man just
[50:23] keep see this no you don't foresee this
[50:24] how do you God would hear the simplicity
[50:27] holiday and any comedy come out how do
[50:30] what you think st. with telling Jesus
[50:31] thing like there if thou be the Son of
[50:33] God that wouldn't for you that was
[50:34] inevitably he were trying to prove it
[50:39] get him
[50:40] [Music]
[50:41] turn these stones into bread he would
[50:45] try to figure out who Jesus is Jesus use
[50:51] your power
[50:52] let me see you use your power to do this
[50:56] buta son of God if you were really just
[51:00] some guy turn these stones into bread
[51:03] what was he doing he was trying to get
[51:06] Jesus to obey his voice Jesus would have
[51:10] done it do you see that something God
[51:12] wouldn't never listen to me but jesus
[51:14] knew the voice of God he said it is
[51:17] written yeah why don't you try me man
[51:19] should not live by bread alone but by
[51:22] every word never seen at a time ago whoa
[51:27] how can you get him tried a let me try
[51:30] this
[51:31] I get noticed from the work if he's God
[51:35] if thou be the Son of God cast ourself
[51:38] down him for me would not he give us
[51:41] angels charge concerning me what I was
[51:44] saying doing this cuz Satan knew that
[51:47] the angels of God would be a comfort
[51:49] around here he knew that he was not
[51:51] crazy he knew they was Ryan God 24/7
[51:54] lady he said you said how you know the
[51:56] angels of God when Gina were hanging on
[51:58] the cross they was standing out leaves
[52:00] is angel ready to turn this world upside
[52:03] down
[52:03] he the hold your peace I got to go to
[52:05] the car by myself hold your peace they
[52:08] would have turned it upside down
[52:10] Satan was trying to see him nudists when
[52:13] that he'd give his angels charge
[52:14] concerning the accept that - I think
[52:16] it's tough to say it is written don't
[52:19] you tell me the LORD thy God see to me
[52:24] he's still testifying he's God he didn't
[52:28] change his testimony so st. say well how
[52:31] do you way he went to play the god thing
[52:33] I am personally to God he just wouldn't
[52:36] get him all the time to him personally
[52:38] he changes herself impersonate God the
[52:42] God he came on a high mountain did he
[52:45] speak to him as he was a God if that
[52:49] would fall down and worship me now he's
[52:52] taking this position that he can't claim
[52:54] he won't it die fall down and worship
[52:57] the wish it was to get sell his
[52:59] birthright over to the devil that was to
[53:02] give his birthright to the devil and to
[53:04] fall down and worship the devil he would
[53:06] had to give over his birthright to it
[53:08] he said I will fall down and worship me
[53:10] I give you the kingdoms of this world
[53:12] and here it looked as though he was God
[53:16] but Gina knew his position in the world
[53:18] he's I will Washington LORD thy God and
[53:22] him only what was that that was the body
[53:25] speaking to the spirit praise God praise
[53:34] God you see what God said Jesus realized
[53:38] here he realized here that's the way he
[53:40] will try st. out here Shane says her he
[53:47] wanted God to worship him in one form of
[53:53] the other but the very you can't deceive
[53:56] the very elect cannot DC the very leg so
[54:01] gasps ibid he was the most powerful
[54:04] showdown that Jesus had and all of come
[54:08] now he gonna go to the cross when the
[54:11] spirit the anointing of God that's left
[54:14] now you're gonna go as with me but you
[54:17] ain't still in the inside
[54:19] so he goes to the cross he goes to
[54:22] Gethsemane as a man singing realize I'm
[54:28] gonna walk over his mind I'm gonna let
[54:31] him and he know what the sting of
[54:33] Defense the bees buzzing around his head
[54:36] he's trying to make a decision for his
[54:39] wife like a demain for his wife that we
[54:42] just saw was about it was a love affair
[54:44] it's a book of Jesus's living yourself
[54:46] out again through Christ hallelujah it
[54:48] was a decision had to be made I had I
[54:51] made a decision I love my wife I'm going
[54:54] to die for gas remedy was the same act
[54:57] going played Jesus and gas hit me making
[54:59] the decision and he tried to eat a head
[55:01] around some with human reasoning human
[55:03] of a human idea he's old God it's wet
[55:08] them blood vessels brushing blood coming
[55:10] from his sweat gland Oh God

[55:26] pass but the descending one and inside
[55:29] the word roller say not as I will but
[55:32] and I will what would he do he made a
[55:36] decision I'm going to die for my wife

[55:49] live for him he made the decision I'm
[55:52] gonna die for you we need to make a
[55:54] decision in a heart Lord I'm gonna live
[55:56] you holiday where he made additional
[55:58] died when he did that he already died
[56:03] Jesus didn't down the cross he died when
[56:06] he made the decision he walked out as a
[56:09] man to die for his wife he could take
[56:12] his way back
[56:13] how do we know where so now we begin to
[56:15] look at this thing right here here he
[56:16] was he goes out now Satan goes are in
[56:19] that same still could not steal he
[56:21] thinking he still testified he said he's
[56:25] God volunteer would I proved it in God

[56:35] I forgot today you called it cannon and
[56:37] tear did you ever see him the thing that
[56:39] beating we it was glass it was metal it
[56:41] was all
[56:42] why does Satan beat him like that he
[56:45] took 39 stripes
[56:47] Satan was intended for Jesus to bleed
[56:49] out but he could it blood didn't come
[56:54] from me sell break another blood sale
[56:56] because he should have died from the
[56:59] loss of blood but he didn't die from the
[57:01] loss of blood the blood of Jesus
[57:03] out
[57:03] he should had already died before he
[57:06] went the calorie but would you know you
[57:08] cannot kill him he said no man to take
[57:10] my life no man could make me bleed out I
[57:13] come from cotton-eye walking back to God
[57:15] his blood created blood to the devil you
[57:20] put him on the cross he thank you dear

[57:27] shoulda realized something took place
[57:29] the way he didn't beat this man we're
[57:32] just man is gonna blade he's still gonna
[57:36] sing sure to realize it's something
[57:40] about this man is different right honey
[57:43] but he was just too dumb to see it he
[57:45] determined well I'll just get rid him
[57:47] from once involved they put him on the
[57:50] cross on the cross Jesus was dead dying
[57:55] but coming out his body blood run across
[57:59] his brow from the thorns it's a bloody
[58:01] mess his balls was reject push God
[58:05] turned this son everything down cuz
[58:09] he can't look on singing your sins was
[58:12] hanging on the cross and the show it
[58:15] didn't it so deform the body of Jesus
[58:18] counselor ever spirit will attack that
[58:20] body he was down for you
[58:22] so by His stripes you could say devil be
[58:25] how do you know where he would take it
[58:27] he was Lutheran he would go get her
[58:29] Brian revelation and take power over
[58:31] sicknesses but we are scared of taking a
[58:34] leap till around this is what God won't
[58:35] we be no regard I want you to be he
[58:37] wants you to accept what the word said
[58:39] about you it's hard for human reasoning

[59:01] kill Jesus man never killed Jesus Jesus
[59:05] I bother I guess forgive my spirit in
[59:07] that I had he the one who submitted his
[59:09] spirit now why we didn't look to the
[59:13] cross I rely we say it was God all the
[59:15] time
[59:16] hiding behind Christ oh you live he's
[59:20] standing he's hanging on the cross let's
