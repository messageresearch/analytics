[1:10] a man I want to see God in the man a man
[1:14] and just to have a blessing to know and
[1:17] to see that God can use feeble lips like
[1:20] ours amen to speak to our hearts amen
[1:23] why don't I some God that he is amen he
[1:26] used a donkey and in the in the Bible
[1:28] and so he can use whatever he wants to
[1:32] but he decided that he was gonna use man
[1:35] a man to speak his word amen and not
[1:39] just a preacher but you sisters
[1:41] you're also preachers in your home amen
[1:43] you young people
[1:45] Amen you're also preachers wherever
[1:47] you're at you don't need to necessarily
[1:49] speak to the people but just by living
[1:52] your life that speaks volumes amen it's
[1:55] more than what your words can say amen
[1:58] praise God so I trust that each and
[2:01] every one of you are doing well this
[2:02] afternoon and could just pray for those
[2:05] that are traveling and I think brother
[2:08] Joe Canada them there they're on their
[2:09] way back so you remember them in prayer
[2:11] and also brother Richard and then
[2:14] probably are still out so just remember
[2:16] them brother Dale and and sister Peggy
[2:20] and he told me that they would be tuning
[2:22] in so so yeah but you know what brother
[2:28] Dale he he deserves he deserves a little
[2:31] break you know and so and so does she
[2:35] amen and you know I have no no ought
[2:38] about it you know you know they need
[2:41] that time yes play so so I'm gonna we're
[2:48] just gonna go ahead and read the
[2:48] scripture now I'm gonna mention
[2:49] something else and then we'll get
[2:51] started
[2:52] let's read up in Matthew chapter 11
[2:56] Matthew chapter 11 and start at verse 11
[3:08] Matthew 11 verse 11 say man if you have
[3:11] it amen
[3:12] Bible says verily I say unto you among
[3:15] them that are born of women there hath
[3:18] not risen of greater than John the
[3:20] Baptist this is Jesus speaking now what
[3:24] standing he that is least in the kingdom
[3:26] of heaven is greater than he and we know
[3:30] the reason why he said that was because
[3:32] John the Baptist he didn't have he
[3:34] didn't have the new birth yet he was
[3:37] introducing the Messiah and so we're
[3:40] greater than John the Baptist because we
[3:42] can experience the new birth in our life
[3:44] amen amen
[3:45] verse 12 and from the days of John the
[3:48] Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven
[3:51] suffereth violence and the violent take
[3:55] it by force that's key for all the
[4:00] prophets and the law prophesied until
[4:03] John and if you will receive it this is
[4:08] Elias which was forth to come he that
[4:11] hath ears now every time Jesus says
[4:13] something like this it's very important
[4:15] he that hath ears to hear let him hear
[4:18] Amen now if we want to turn to to Luke
[4:21] chapter 16 and starting at verse 14 this
[4:31] is the same scripture the way it Luke's
[4:35] account but it's worded a little bit
[4:38] differently start at verse 14 and it
[4:40] says and the Pharisees also who were
[4:43] covetous heard all these things and they
[4:46] derided him the right of Jesus and he
[4:49] said unto them ye are they which justify
[4:52] yourselves before men but God knoweth
[4:57] your hearts for that which is highly
[5:00] esteemed among Jews men is abomination
[5:04] in the sight of God so in other words
[5:07] what they esteemed was great and was uh
[5:09] you know holy and him you know just the
[5:13] right righteous way it was a stink in
[5:16] the God's nostrils
[5:17] the law verse 16 the law and the
[5:20] prophets were until John since that time
[5:23] the kingdom of God is preached and every
[5:27] man presses into it
[5:29] amen and it is easier for heaven and
[5:34] earth to pass than one tittle of the law
[5:37] to fail I like that
[5:39] Amen you this word ain't gonna fail Amen
[5:42] everything else will take place but this
[5:45] word will will fulfill be fulfilled amen
[5:49] so let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[5:50] this afternoon our Heavenly Father we
[5:53] thank you Lord for the opportunity to
[5:54] gather here together with believers Lord

[6:28] aside so that you can speak through my
[6:30] my lips Lord and father God stopped me
[6:33] from saying anything that I should not

[8:30] Thursday amen
[8:32] also I want to say happy birthday to my
[8:35] brother Bob 43 years old 43 right yeah
[8:44] that's right yeah he said that with yeah
[8:47] that's right but god bless him and
[8:52] appreciate brother Bob in there I've
[8:54] I've come before before I started coming
[8:58] to the church here more than continually
[9:01] I just kind of knew brother Bob by just
[9:03] kind of shaking his hand but as the
[9:05] years have gone and kind of gotten to
[9:07] know him a little bit more I really
[9:09] realized you know he's he really loves
[9:12] the Lord amen and I just appreciate his
[9:14] friendship appreciate appreciate
[9:16] everything that he stands for amen
[9:18] and just you know we have a lot in
[9:21] common so but just god bless him I think
[9:26] for granting him another year
[9:28] amen praise Lord so tonight I would just
[9:33] want to speak about local give this if I
[9:36] could give this a little Tyler a violent
[9:38] takeover of God a violent takeover of
[9:42] God you know
[9:43] Saints and when Jesus was speaking here
[9:46] about how the how the kingdom suffereth
[9:50] violence and the violent take it by
[9:52] force because at that time when John the
[9:54] Baptist was was preaching he came by he
[9:58] came forth saying repent for the kingdom
[10:01] of heaven is at hand amen and it was it
[10:05] was at that time when those words
[10:07] started to be sound and forth cuz you
[10:08] didn't really see anything about the
[10:10] kingdom of God or the kingdom of heaven
[10:12] in the Old Testament it was when John
[10:14] the Baptist came on the scene and he was
[10:16] telling the people repent for the
[10:17] kingdom of heaven is at hand then Jesus
[10:20] Christ comes and starts preaching the
[10:22] kingdom of God and bringing the kingdom
[10:24] of God and laying the kingdom of God and
[10:26] relaying the kingdom of heaven down to
[10:28] the people and that was part of what
[10:31] they repenting was part of what the
[10:33] kingdom of God was all about because
[10:36] remember when Jesus said to when he met
[10:39] with Nicodemus and he told them that you
[10:41] must be born again it was a my supposed
[10:44] to go back into my mom's womb I'm a
[10:46] mother and he didn't know what he didn't
[10:48] and he was a man that had studied the
[10:50] law and studied the the the scriptures
[10:53] and yet did not understand the kingdom
[10:56] of God how I wonder if that's how our we
[11:00] are you could be in the message for 15
[11:04] 20 30 years and still don't know what
[11:07] this message is all about still don't
[11:10] understand what this kingdom is all
[11:11] about because all it is this is
[11:13] intellectual knowledge to you amen
[11:15] so here's and so Jesus comes in on the
[11:19] scene he says in the kingdom of heaven
[11:21] started being preached since John and
[11:24] then the violent which were the people
[11:26] at that time coming in droves wanting to
[11:31] get a repent wanted to get baptized
[11:33] beyond the John John's ministry and then
[11:37] when Jesus comes on the scene they want
[11:39] to hear what Jesus has to say now that
[11:41] not everybody did but there was a lot of
[11:44] people at that time because this was
[11:46] something new something never had seen
[11:47] before and so they wanted to and so
[11:51] that's why the scripture
[11:52] it's interesting how Jesus words it that
[11:55] that the now the Kingdom of Heaven
[11:56] suffereth violence and the violent take
[12:00] it by force and Jesus I mean Jesus
[12:03] wasn't opposed about the kingdom being
[12:06] taken he wanted the kingdom to be taken
[12:09] that's the reason why he said in the
[12:10] violent take it by force so that's the
[12:13] so that tells me that that is the only
[12:15] way that the kingdom of God is to be
[12:17] possessed they men it's by force now
[12:21] we're gonna get more about it we're
[12:22] gonna get more into that because let me
[12:24] tell you since we are living in a lakhs
[12:26] hour in this hour we are living in an
[12:29] hour where we think oh everything's fine
[12:31] and dandy and we are okay we just sit
[12:34] back and listen to a sermon and and
[12:37] brother Dale the brother way brother
[12:39] Louie's brother Bob whoever preaches
[12:41] just preaches 45 minutes and and we're
[12:43] just going to go home and turn on TV and
[12:46] do whatever not think one time of what
[12:49] was said behind this pulpit let me tell
[12:52] you one day will be the last time you
[12:54] hear a message behind this pulpit and
[12:56] the next thing you know you'll be facing
[12:57] God and what are you going to do then
[12:59] I'm speaking to both the the the the
[13:02] pulpit all the way to the janitor's room
[13:04] young people and everybody because I'm
[13:06] part of it we get Sol axed in this hour
[13:09] and we think that that well cos brother
[13:11] Dale's preaching the word and then and
[13:13] then the ministry here is preaching the
[13:15] word and we don't do anything about it
[13:17] ourselves is that taking the kingdom by
[13:21] force now that's taking the kingdom by
[13:24] nonchalant actually you're not taking
[13:26] the king by you want you want the
[13:29] kingdom you got to take it by force Amen
[13:32] praise God so if I say something tonight
[13:36] that might hurt some feelings will thank
[13:38] goodness thank God because I will
[13:40] doesn't matter I don't care you can this
[13:43] will be the last time I preach if I have
[13:44] to preach and brother Dale you know I'm
[13:47] sure he'll be he don't mind cuz Saint
[13:51] let me tell you it's time that you know
[13:54] Saints brother brother Wade preached of
[13:57] a few a few years ago on Daniel seventy
[14:00] weeks and the way things are panning out
[14:01] right now in the world it could very
[14:05] well
[14:06] be that next year we've LIGO in a
[14:08] rapture now I'm not saying that does set
[14:12] the Lord and brother the way wasn't
[14:13] saying that either at that time but just
[14:15] the way things are panning out for us to
[14:18] just sitting around not you know not
[14:22] caring about and just taking everything
[14:24] like a routine I'm tired of the routine
[14:28] sense I want to see God working them on
[14:31] our miss we have people that are sick we
[14:34] have people that need heat salvation we
[14:37] have young people that need the Holy
[14:39] Ghost and that and that was the same
[14:41] thing that has taped for several years
[14:44] and where's the young people that were
[14:46] here just a few years ago where are they
[14:47] out there now serving the Lord they
[14:50] should be here at church what are they
[14:52] doing why and it like brother Graham
[14:54] said it's not true child delinquencies
[14:57] parent delinquency
[14:59] because as parents they see our laxa
[15:02] dacing spirit and the falling asleep at
[15:05] church III get in that same way too then
[15:09] that our children just follow just right
[15:11] after they are children normally just
[15:15] want to follow the easy route and if you
[15:19] as parents show them the easier route
[15:21] and you get home and you don't study you
[15:23] don't pray you don't act upon the Word
[15:26] of God or what was said behind the
[15:28] pulpit your children are going the same
[15:29] way amen so the Bible says here in in in
[15:39] in Luke 16 it says since that time the
[15:44] kingdom of God is preached and every man
[15:47] presses into it now that's the question
[15:50] we need to ask ourselves we've been in
[15:52] this message we've heard this message
[15:54] now for 30 40 50 years some of us had
[15:57] word in we're still living when the
[15:59] Prophet was still with us and have we
[16:02] possessed the kingdom pressed into that
[16:04] kingdom the way we should know will I
[16:08] know too much now about the message I
[16:10] know too much I've got revelation my
[16:15] dad's the preacher and my mom you know
[16:18] she's been in the mitt I don't need none
[16:21] of that like I said you might be hearing
[16:25] your last sermon amen praise God
[16:31] now the Bible now the the word violence
[16:34] in the in the Webster's dictionary it
[16:39] says this is the meaning it says the use
[16:42] of physical force so as to injure abuse
[16:45] damage or destroy now that's not of
[16:51] course that's not what Jesus was was
[16:52] speaking about here but then the other
[16:54] the other one is intense turbulent or
[16:56] furious and often destructive action or
[16:59] force the violence of the storm now
[17:02] we've had violent storms we've seen how
[17:05] what damage that could cause but look
[17:07] what I like what this says it says
[17:09] vehement feeling or expression a fervor
[17:14] also an instance of such action or
[17:17] feeling it's a vehement amen so then I
[17:21] looked up what the word vehement meant I
[17:23] know what what it is but I mean I just
[17:25] wanted to read that to you it's means
[17:27] intensely emotional impassioned fervid
[17:34] vehement patriotism you know we're so
[17:39] we're very patriotic about the America
[17:43] and about the flag and that's good
[17:45] that's now because you know when the
[17:47] World Cup comes around and I'm happy
[17:50] that my teams in the World Cup you know
[17:52] I'm happy to see that you know and you
[17:56] know how I like soccer and so forth but
[18:00] that's fine to be petty patriotic and
[18:02] there's no problem with that man but
[18:05] sometimes we get we get so caught up
[18:08] with more of that the natural things in
[18:10] life and that same energy that we give
[18:14] other things if we would give it to the
[18:16] kingdom of God amen oh my we would be so
[18:19] much better off amen
[18:21] the same energy that you take a man to
[18:24] to to express yourself in on social
[18:28] media or whatever
[18:30] that energy if you can just take it amen
[18:33] to to to look more into the Word of God
[18:36] to get down for five minutes and pray
[18:40] instead of taking five minutes to post
[18:43] something on social media and nobody
[18:46] cares afterwards but I don't really care
[18:50] what you ate yesterday I don't really
[18:53] care what where you wear your what
[18:55] restaurant you're eating at I don't care
[18:59] I do care if you you know if you post
[19:03] the Word of God on there something that
[19:06] has to do with the Word of God
[19:07] oh yeah I'll read that but I don't care
[19:10] about anything else I because it doesn't
[19:17] interest the child of God you know
[19:19] Saints I've come to a point now that I
[19:23] realize that the time this time is
[19:26] winding down and the pity paddling and
[19:30] they just did he darling with the with
[19:33] the things of God here and there and and
[19:35] not really taking it so sincere and and
[19:39] those days are long gone I've come to
[19:43] the point you know now that that it's
[19:45] it's it's obtained God or perish you
[19:50] know there's no time for us to sit back
[19:53] and relax it's time for us to meditate
[19:56] on the things that are being said in
[19:58] this hour getting the word amen and get
[20:01] that word in you that's how you possess
[20:03] the kingdom amen any other way you're
[20:07] just wasting your time you know we had
[20:13] our you know the last angel left the
[20:16] scene Billy Graham left the scene things
[20:20] are shaping into place you know and so
[20:25] are we shaping into place that's the
[20:28] question we need to ask ourselves amen
[20:31] so this vehement intense emotional
[20:35] passionate burbot deeply felt and
[20:38] forcibly expressed do we forcibly do we
[20:44] feel that way about God in this hour oh
[20:46] we might have felt about God that way
[20:48] maybe 10 15 20 years ago 30 years ago
[20:52] when you first come to the Lord do you
[20:54] remember when you first come to the
[20:56] Jesus Christ
[20:56] oh my you word you were so passionate
[20:59] about the word yeah there was nothing
[21:01] that would videogames forget it throw
[21:05] them out the window but then all of a
[21:07] sudden the video games are coming back
[21:08] in the in the house the movies are
[21:11] coming back in the house the things are
[21:13] coming back in the house that you
[21:14] thought oh my I'll never those things
[21:17] are back in your play taking the place
[21:18] of God in your life you don't have a God
[21:22] in your life we don't know we don't we
[21:24] don't have we don't have idols in our in
[21:26] our in our in our houses you know and
[21:28] and things like that let me tell you the
[21:31] things that you like to do that take
[21:33] place before prayer and studying that's
[21:35] an idol that's an idol before and God is
[21:40] a jealous God God is a jealous God
[21:43] because God God wants to bless you more
[21:46] than you think that he wants to that he
[21:49] wanted that he would want to bless you
[21:50] but as I said before if you only just
[21:54] give him your arm that's all he's gonna
[21:56] use you give him your finger that's all
[21:59] he'll use I like the example that
[22:01] brother Wade gave the other day about
[22:03] the beehives you know well did you know
[22:07] he what the person wants to know more
[22:10] about about about the beehives and about
[22:12] what it is to raise bees and honey and
[22:14] all that well he's going to just get
[22:16] more beehives and more beehives to learn
[22:18] more to learn more but if you're just
[22:22] fine just coming to church and singing
[22:25] for 30 minutes and and listening to a
[22:28] message for 45 minutes and then out the
[22:31] door and that's it then that's all you
[22:34] get out of God I want more out of God
[22:36] than just that amen but now you might
[22:41] say well that's brother Lewis just just
[22:43] preaching and you know just saying you
[22:46] know whatever how do you know it's not
[22:49] God talking to you
[22:50] I thought that that's what the fawful
[22:55] Ministry supposed to be God speaking
[22:57] through our hearts
[22:58] oh that's just brother Louise you know
[23:01] he's up there jibber jabbering that's
[23:05] what I would say about Jesus Christ you
[23:09] know what I'm saying
[23:10] I say these things because this is what
[23:12] I'm express feeling on my own you know I
[23:16] want to draw closer to God
[23:19] you know when brother Dale asks the
[23:20] question the other day how many of you
[23:22] have even picked up a seals book you
[23:26] know and just by just by the reaction of
[23:30] how the you know that you could it said
[23:32] a lot of words you know now I'm not
[23:36] gonna say that I'm not I've told this to
[23:38] brother Bob I'm not the best reader in
[23:40] the reading is always a weakness of mine
[23:43] but I love listening though I can listen
[23:46] and I can listen and read so I may not
[23:50] have been I may not have read the seal
[23:52] book but I've heard it but but but I
[23:59] want more I just don't want to release
[24:01] I'll read it once and then listen to it
[24:03] once and that's it there's more in there
[24:05] amen there's more in there you know you
[24:08] just don't read the Bible once so I
[24:09] finished reading the Bible and that's it
[24:11] no amens
[24:12] God's Word is eternal that means there's
[24:15] no ending to this revelation to you
[24:17] there's there's gems in there that only
[24:20] you're gonna be able to find if you seek
[24:23] that's what Jesus said seek and you
[24:25] shall find knock and it shall be opened
[24:27] unto you but if you don't seek then
[24:31] you're not gonna find and if you only
[24:34] seek a little bit you'll only find a
[24:35] little bit but if you find if you seek a
[24:38] lot you'll find a lot what a concept the
[24:44] law of God amen amen
[24:48] praise God now so why does the sinner
[24:52] take the kingdom by force well for one
[24:55] they feel the sinner feels that they
[24:58] have no natural right to it you see
[25:02] that's the reason why the sinner
[25:04] back then when they would hear Jesus and
[25:06] John the Baptist he meant they would
[25:08] flock amen and they would take the
[25:10] kingdom of God by violence for one
[25:12] because they didn't feel that they had
[25:14] any right to it you know do you feel
[25:18] that way you know and do you feel that
[25:23] the oh well imma just entitled to it all
[25:26] you're not entitled to anything God
[25:28] wants you to do your part too as well
[25:31] there's a part that you must play you
[25:36] know the children of Israel they had God
[25:39] had given them the promise already that
[25:41] they were going to take the land that
[25:43] God was God had already given them the
[25:45] land but they had to go in and possess
[25:49] it themselves as I said Sunday when I
[25:54] was when I was talking about the kingdom
[25:55] of God and if I encourage you all to
[25:57] listen to that series you know five-part
[25:59] series that we did and and and God
[26:02] wasn't just gonna take them here you are
[26:07] all right on a flowery bed of ease
[26:11] that's the kind of Christian life we all
[26:13] want but God doesn't work that way God
[26:19] does not work that way God God God's
[26:22] given us the promise the promise is in
[26:25] his word it's already there the promise
[26:28] is here this is the message right but
[26:32] can you take this amen and apply to your
[26:35] life so that you can overcome the devil
[26:37] in your life so that you can overcome
[26:39] whatever it is that you're struggling
[26:41] with let me tell you what there's an
[26:43] overcoming that you and I must do Saints
[26:45] in this hour I heard something the other
[26:48] day I thought it was I thought it was
[26:50] good it was simple but very profound and
[26:53] that is that don't play with the demons
[26:58] that you want to overcome the demons
[27:02] that are there that you say you want to
[27:05] overcome whatever it is that you want to
[27:07] come lying lust or whatever it is but if
[27:10] you play with those demons you're never
[27:13] gonna overcome them
[27:14] amen if you just pity patter with the
[27:17] demons
[27:17] and those days you're never gonna
[27:19] overcome them they're always gonna have
[27:21] overcoming power over you it's like yes
[27:25] kill them amen so and of course you know
[27:31] the message of the Cross at that time of
[27:34] course Jesus had not died yet but today
[27:37] you know you may still see people maybe
[27:40] accepting the Lord Jesus Christ and and
[27:43] how did you come in amen that the
[27:45] message of the Cross that what does it
[27:47] do to you does it do to you when you
[27:51] think about about about what Christ did
[27:54] for you does it do the same thing it did
[27:56] for you 20 years ago
[27:58] don't you think about that Saints that's
[28:01] the word that's the word but some of us
[28:04] well I got the message now I don't need
[28:06] all that stuff anymore
[28:08] we're all the way up here now you know
[28:10] in the in the in the headstone and yes
[28:12] and all that's it all but let me tell
[28:15] you what you know brother wait brother
[28:18] wait he likes he likes meat he talked
[28:22] about meat and and steak and things like
[28:25] that and that's fine
[28:26] you know I say this I say this and we'll
[28:31] read the scripture together we should be
[28:35] at the point where rate eating meat now
[28:37] right spiritually speaking we're eating
[28:40] me and the Bible even says Paul update I
[28:42] believe says that you should be even
[28:44] teachers right now not necessarily
[28:47] preaching but can you explain the things
[28:50] around this message can you explain the
[28:52] Word of God can you tell somebody about
[28:54] about what happened in the garden
[28:55] without quoting just with the word can
[29:00] you do it
[29:00] I bet you must leave us we can't do it
[29:04] that's the reason why we avoid talking
[29:06] about anything Christian with people
[29:07] because we agree that we don't know what
[29:10] to say we don't know about the Bible we
[29:13] just come to church so but I say this
[29:21] this I say this you should be already
[29:24] eating skillful eating meat spiritual
[29:26] meat but at the same time we not we
[29:31] don't
[29:31] forget about the milk as well the milk
[29:34] is the foundation and you know like I
[29:37] told one church the other day I said you
[29:39] know I still like to drink milk but
[29:41] that's not what I completely feed off of
[29:43] right milk has this has has some
[29:46] vitamins has some things that you need
[29:47] is well in there and but I also need
[29:51] heavier food as well with a glass of
[29:53] milk not forgetting the foundations of
[29:57] Christ not forgetting repenting not
[29:59] forgetting baptism the name Lord Jesus
[30:01] Christ not forgetting the message of the
[30:03] Cross not forgetting these things that
[30:06] we so easily forget just because we're
[30:08] in the message did God want you to
[30:13] forget about these things
[30:15] no you might say oh he's just bringing
[30:21] denominational stuff you can say
[30:23] whatever you want to say but is we need
[30:25] to repent we need to get we need to get
[30:28] back soul-searching and get back in and
[30:30] even it fill these the this this this uh
[30:33] up here with with people repenting if
[30:36] you need to if you really want to take
[30:39] the kingdom by violence by force because
[30:42] God ain't gonna make you God's not gonna
[30:47] make you now complacency is the 21st
[30:50] century Christian battle we are so
[30:53] complacent in this our complacency
[30:58] everywhere well especially in Christians
[31:05] and then I come into the message you
[31:08] know I came into the message in in in
[31:10] nineteen ninety nine and I saw even more
[31:13] complacency and they were believing that
[31:19] the God sent a prophet and yet they were
[31:21] more complacent that's probably the
[31:23] reason why oh we have it all we have it
[31:27] off we're just kind of sitting around
[31:28] waiting for the train to come and pick
[31:31] us up and we take it you're gonna fall
[31:34] asleep that way I always I've always
[31:38] said this Saints I've always said you
[31:40] put that car on cruise control you're
[31:43] gonna end up falling asleep
[31:45] a car driving on itself oh it'll drive
[31:47] yeah but you'll end up falling asleep
[31:50] and then fall off on the side of the
[31:52] ditch so road somewhere and that'll be
[31:53] the end of you and and and don't think
[31:57] that they're putting this thing on
[31:58] cruise control and then one day I'm just
[32:00] gonna just go to church and sing some
[32:03] songs and do what it would you know just
[32:06] be there so that you know people can see
[32:08] that I'm there and then you know go home
[32:11] and do my thing and then one day you
[32:13] know it all just kind of gets
[32:14] straightened up with God you know he
[32:16] knows my heart and he knows what my
[32:21] that's not that's not the attitude to
[32:24] take you know saying that the attitude
[32:27] of a Christian a man is that they want
[32:29] more of God amen they want desire they
[32:33] desire more of God it's a zeal that is
[32:36] in them a feeling a man that they that
[32:38] they're not complacent I imagine the
[32:41] other day when brother long you know
[32:42] preached where he was preaching I was
[32:44] thoroughly enjoying what he was saying
[32:45] next thing you know it was it was time
[32:47] he was dismissing I'm like what no I
[32:50] wanted more I'm like brother Chris why
[32:54] in the world you can ask the brothers in
[32:56] the back I'm like I can't believe this
[33:00] he finished early I wanted more but you
[33:06] know what several years ago that wasn't
[33:09] the desire I had in my heart I was glad
[33:12] when they were finishing up church oh my
[33:15] I couldn't wait for church service to go
[33:16] up cuz I had things I need to do at my
[33:18] house video games to play and and thing
[33:21] bad things to do there wasn't anything
[33:24] good now our desire the word you know a
[33:29] Christian truly desires to be in the
[33:31] house of God it's not not just satisfied
[33:34] with 30 minutes 45 minutes so I did my
[33:37] religion thanks that's not that's not
[33:40] that's not a that's not taking the
[33:43] kingdom by force and so in Revelation to
[33:47] the Church of Ephesus left their first
[33:49] love we see that and of course Jesus
[33:54] tells them in that same chapter the two
[33:58] repent to get back into their first love
[34:01] amen so even even at the first church
[34:05] age they were already complacency was
[34:07] already creeping in how much more in
[34:12] this age my goodness
[34:15] where everybody's complacent and
[34:18] everybody thinks that Christianity is
[34:20] just so easy and so it has to be so easy
[34:23] and so nonchalant and and you think
[34:26] about the people who suffered before us
[34:28] and and and and and the things that they
[34:30] went through a man just to be able to to
[34:33] read the word I heard a testimony about
[34:37] a Chinese brother a Chinese man who who
[34:43] was he might have heard the testimony he
[34:45] was in prison he was put in prison for
[34:46] his faith he was there they were he was
[34:50] in a small little jail cell and they
[34:52] were beating him and doing all kinds of
[34:54] things to him and putting needles in
[34:56] between his fingernails and inside his
[34:58] fingernails and all kinds of stuff but
[35:00] the whole time he's he's he's already
[35:03] been delivered now he's been but he's
[35:06] tested he's testified of this the whole
[35:08] time he said I was just praying that God
[35:10] would send somebody to bring me a Bible
[35:14] and when he was praying that with blood
[35:17] are you spurting out of his his face and
[35:19] his fingernails and all kinds of stuff
[35:21] the next day one of the jail guards
[35:24] throws him a Bible inside of the inside
[35:26] of the inside of the cell one of the
[35:29] ones that was mistreating him for some
[35:31] reason he said that he just threw us a
[35:33] Bible in there and he said Lord I just
[35:37] let me know I might I wasn't asking you
[35:40] see God is in line God was probably
[35:42] trying to teach him something you know
[35:44] but God was in line he was in line with
[35:46] what God really wanted for him amen
[35:48] he could have said was Lord I want to be
[35:51] get I wouldn't be get out of this place
[35:53] can you just get me out know why he was
[35:55] praying was lord give me a Bible and God
[35:58] granted that for him but after that then
[36:01] God granted his freedom seek ye first
[36:05] the kingdom of God and His righteousness
[36:08] and all these other things will be added
[36:10] unto you saying
[36:12] all these other things money all these
[36:16] other things will be added to you know
[36:18] it doesn't mean we're gonna be rich or
[36:19] anything like that but but but you know
[36:21] all the needs will be met he promised it
[36:25] in his word but if we put other things
[36:28] before God don't expect for God to meet
[36:30] your needs or to meet to give you the
[36:33] desires of your heart I hope somebody's
[36:37] taking this in amen now brother I
[36:41] understand if you could bring up the
[36:43] this this chart here that's the picture
[36:46] I hope I hope he's able to bring it so
[36:49] the Laodicean church we know that it was
[36:51] lukewarm and dying spiritually and we
[36:57] read that there in in in in in in
[37:00] Revelation chapter 3 now brother brother
[37:02] Joe Canada he sent me this picture
[37:05] several years ago and I thought it was
[37:07] so good how to know this is Uma back out
[37:10] brother Anderson how to know that you
[37:14] are dying spiritually when one is that
[37:18] you have left your first love so the
[37:21] message of the cross you know isn't
[37:22] isn't doesn't do anything for you
[37:25] anymore I just go to church and that's
[37:28] it
[37:29] the church services bore you you can see
[37:35] that when with the way some people sit
[37:37] around and sit at church you know
[37:39] sleeping the whole time yeah I have you
[37:42] kind of dozing off with you know hearing
[37:44] that's understand and of course the
[37:46] older older generation I understand you
[37:48] know there's you know but when you when
[37:50] you're young and you're dozing off
[37:53] sleeping and I'm talking about sleeping
[37:56] yeah something's wrong with that
[37:58] something's wrong with you so the church
[38:03] services bore you
[38:04] that means the Word of God is boring to
[38:06] you you have no interest in saving souls
[38:11] you have no interest about the people
[38:15] out there that you come in contact with
[38:17] every day
[38:17] Lord look you know not till I tell my
[38:21] daughter's this and I tell Bella this
[38:22] because she's in public schooling and
[38:24] she say
[38:25] to encounter certain things and things
[38:27] you know certain with with other girls
[38:30] and I tell her I said look you don't
[38:33] have to impose your way of living to
[38:35] them you don't even have to say anything
[38:37] to them just live a certain life they'll
[38:40] be they'll make them thirsty and they'll
[38:41] ask when they ask that's your
[38:43] opportunity and of course you don't want
[38:45] to impose they're young and they have
[38:48] other things they need to be thinking
[38:49] about but do you say before you leave
[38:53] the house every morning lord give me an
[38:55] opportunity to bring the soul to the
[38:57] kingdom of heaven to speak or to drop a
[39:00] seed but because you don't study the
[39:02] Word of God or you don't read or you or
[39:04] you don't take in the things that you
[39:06] heard the night the on Wednesday night
[39:08] or Sunday
[39:11] you'd the hope hopefully you don't have
[39:13] to talk to anybody about about say about
[39:17] the word of God because you don't
[39:19] understand the Word of God I'm just
[39:23] gonna be wrong with you all because
[39:25] better to be it that way
[39:27] worldly things attract you more than
[39:29] spiritual things and you know that young
[39:37] people they have a tough time with this
[39:39] you know we're not just young people I
[39:43] was adults too and you're you are
[39:47] fooling yourself thinking that
[39:50] everything's fine and dandy you're just
[39:53] fooling yourself that you think you'll
[39:55] come to the end and you face the Lord
[39:58] and you say Lord I have nothing to say
[40:04] what can you I went to church every day
[40:07] III did some work in the church I did
[40:11] but that's all yeah by failing to do
[40:17] what you know you need to do
[40:19] I hope I'm challenging that's under me
[40:21] all this morning or this this evening
[40:24] frequent absences at the worship
[40:26] services you know I I I'm told my wife
[40:33] this and and and I've expressed this to
[40:35] them but if if it wasn't for for me
[40:38] having a family and having the girls and
[40:41] helping my wife back there
[40:42] I'd be right up here like I want to get
[40:46] the blessings as fresh as possible I'd
[40:50] be right up here but that's one of the
[40:52] signs that somebody's backsliding
[40:53] because they're backsliding for they're
[40:55] going all the way to the back next thing
[40:57] you know they're all the way back in the
[40:58] back door and you don't see them anymore
[41:00] they'll start off all happy and enthused
[41:04] up here and a member of the Delta Lord
[41:07] next thing you know they're just two
[41:09] three four five six and all the way in
[41:12] the back and then you just see them out
[41:14] the door and of course no participation
[41:19] in the work of the church I'll just kind
[41:22] of sit in the corner and just kind of
[41:23] let people you know members when I
[41:24] preach the message about a bib and apron
[41:26] you know a true Christian puts on an
[41:29] apron and serves others the ones that
[41:32] don't really care about you know they
[41:34] have dibs on and just well just feed me
[41:36] whatever you know and they get kind of
[41:38] sloppy and get kind of but I say Saints
[41:41] wait from your sleep because the church
[41:45] needs you your justin is an important
[41:48] vessel as the minister is as the deacon
[41:51] is as the song leader is you are needed
[41:55] amen
[41:57] so brilliance and just bring up the
[42:01] scripture revelation my goodness
[42:03] I thought I wasn't gonna have anything
[42:05] to say let's go through these scriptures
[42:11] here it's because Saints again this is
[42:14] not just me saying this the scriptures
[42:16] that we're about to read say the sack
[42:18] same thing
[42:18] now here's revelations chapter 3 verse
[42:23] 15 well you know these scriptures we've
[42:25] read them but let's read them all right
[42:28] I know that works this is Jesus speaking
[42:31] to the Church of later see I know that
[42:33] works that thou art neither cold nor hot
[42:35] I would our thou wert cold or hot not
[42:41] lukewarm Wow
[42:43] you either in or out but not in between
[42:46] amen so then because thou art lukewarm
[42:51] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[42:55] out of my mouth
[42:56] Jesus himself in other words he's gonna
[43:00] vomit you out of his mouth you have no
[43:02] part in him because they'll say as I am
[43:06] rich and increased with Goods and have
[43:08] need of nothing and and I said I said
[43:11] downstairs I said in this age
[43:13] this definitely this this can really
[43:16] apply to this age and Jesus was right
[43:17] because with the with the with the
[43:21] invention of the internet anybody can
[43:23] make money now you know you don't have
[43:26] to be at a 8 to 9 9 to 5 job anymore you
[43:31] can live off passive income from the
[43:33] internet if you if you work hard enough
[43:35] to do it you know and there's many
[43:37] people out there doing it now living on
[43:39] beaches and letting money work for them
[43:42] and not them work for money it's a
[43:44] mentality it's a mentality now that the
[43:47] previous generations don't don't don't
[43:50] understand but that's how it is nowadays
[43:52] so a lot of people make me money there's
[43:55] a there's a lot more millionaires now
[43:57] than there was 20 years ago because of
[44:00] the internet so because they'll say is
[44:02] I'm rich and increased with Goods and
[44:04] have need of nothing and knowest not
[44:06] thou art wretched and miserable and poor
[44:08] and blind and naked that's how Jesus saw
[44:11] them they saw themselves rich and
[44:13] increased with Goods Jesus all naked
[44:16] blind and poor amen counts verse 18 I
[44:21] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[44:23] the fire that thou mayst be rich and
[44:25] white raiment that thou mayest be
[44:26] clothed and that the same shame of thy
[44:28] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[44:30] eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see
[44:32] verse 19 as many as i love i rebuke and
[44:36] chasten it is this is speaking to
[44:40] Laodicea so if you feel like this as
[44:44] well as this brother lui speaking and
[44:47] I'll just go home and you know just do
[44:50] my own thing then that means you didn't
[44:53] get rebuked or chase tonight as to you
[44:56] it's just another service as many as I
[44:59] love I rebuke and chasten be zealous
[45:01] therefore and repent this is not the
[45:05] disciples saying this this is Jesus
[45:07] saying this amen
[45:10] so you know but st. Simon we are so
[45:15] satisfied with routines we're so
[45:17] satisfied with with with it's got to be
[45:20] this way and if it kind of falters out a
[45:22] little bit from that way then we just
[45:25] you know if somebody gets up and
[45:28] shouting and dancing in the spirit
[45:30] everybody oh we don't do that here like
[45:35] it's a Baptist Church or something like
[45:37] that Saints that's that's that's that's
[45:40] part of taking the kingdom Saints I
[45:43] believe we have gifts in this church I
[45:46] believe it where are they not being
[45:49] exorcised why then you know how that
[45:53] brother brand preached that message why
[45:54] God God ghasts you why I've given you
[46:02] the promises I've given you everything
[46:03] that you have need of I've given you
[46:05] everything the message fivefold ministry
[46:07] of teaching ministry I've given you
[46:09] everything yet you just rather sit there
[46:11] and listen to and just be sleepy young
[46:20] people you know if you have a you know
[46:23] your dad that preaches or whatever it
[46:25] doesn't matter your dad preaches you're
[46:27] not going behind your dad's coattail
[46:29] you're not going to heaven because your
[46:30] dad's a minister or he's a deacon or
[46:33] your mom serves the Lord or no you're
[46:36] going because you have an experience
[46:37] with God yourself you know him and you
[46:40] ain't and you want more of him it's a
[46:46] desire that God has to put in you
[46:49] otherwise you're just manufacturing
[46:52] things if it's not true desire for you
[46:55] to want more of God to pray to seek Him
[46:58] to to be in the house of God to serve
[47:01] the brethren and do these things amen
[47:04] that that caused you to grow more in
[47:05] Christ amen
[47:07] then you're just putting peacock
[47:08] feathers on your Buzzard carcass you
[47:12] just look like a Christian and but
[47:14] you're not you may pray like a Christian
[47:17] but you're not
[47:18] you may sound like a Christian but you
[47:21] don't you're not a Christian I hope I'm
[47:25] challenging you
[47:27] I hope so because things we don't well
[47:30] you know I love the teaching ministry
[47:32] and I understand you know we when
[47:35] teaching goes forth we have to pay
[47:37] attention and it's best to pay attention
[47:38] you know but sometimes we need something
[47:41] like this every now and then man I know
[47:43] I do
[47:43] amen I gotta get shaking up say we
[47:46] knowing that you know there's sleepiness
[47:48] that we get in all the time you know and
[47:50] all these things my goodness it's when I
[47:55] do it because I do it because I get in
[47:57] that condition and then I and then and
[48:01] then brother Dale gives me the
[48:02] opportunity to preach well then I'll
[48:03] just preach what's on my heart amen
[48:08] so the question Saints are you closer to
[48:13] God than you were a year ago are you
[48:17] closer to God than you were five years
[48:19] ago ten years ago when you first heard
[48:23] the message when you first heard that
[48:26] brother Branham was a prophet are you
[48:28] closer to God didn't then and and you
[48:36] know if we get so violent about we get
[48:38] so violent about things other things you
[48:40] know Church programs you know the church
[48:43] program has to be dust and dust and dust
[48:45] we got to do it like this and and you
[48:47] know and about your Christmas trees and
[48:49] all these things Christmas and all that
[48:52] you you get so so violent about those
[48:55] things and then when it comes time for
[48:56] the Word of God there's no violence in
[48:59] that how you're seen violence it's
[49:05] radical
[49:07] if you've watched violent movie or
[49:09] something like that you know it's not
[49:10] anything it's something that's that's
[49:12] moving you know it's something that's
[49:14] violent
[49:15] you know now that's we're not talking
[49:17] about physical bloodshed and violence
[49:19] but what we're talking about is taking
[49:20] God taking God Lord I won't let you go
[49:24] until you bless me amen that's what
[49:31] Jacob did Jacob did the exam and that
[49:35] was in the Old Testament that was it
[49:38] before Jesus Christ died on the cross
[49:41] under the the blood of bulls and goats
[49:43] and he said Lord I'm not going to let
[49:47] you go until you bless me and the thing
[49:50] that I like about that scripture is that
[49:52] the in the end that Scripture it says
[49:55] that he got a loan after he let his
[49:56] family go and then kind of domed the
[49:59] cross you know he said alone that's what
[50:03] we need to do say every now and then
[50:04] just be alone just you and God and when
[50:08] you're when you're meditating on God God
[50:10] comes on the scene and then you wrestled
[50:12] with God and you say Lord bless me or
[50:15] else I'll perish and that's what
[50:19] happened to Jacob he was so blessed that
[50:22] does the angel hit him on the side and
[50:25] and his walk was different after that he
[50:29] was never the same after that neither
[50:31] was his name everything changed about
[50:35] him but we're just so custom to just
[50:39] give a doing a little five-minute
[50:41] prayers you know Lord forgive me I'm
[50:44] sorry now I'm about to go to sleep Lord
[50:46] and you just bless me now watch over me
[50:49] Lord thank you Lord Jesus amen
[50:53] there's no blessing in that
[51:00] and yet you're sleeping in the middle of
[51:02] the five-minute prayer to MA so you know
[51:10] thanks whatever whatever you do as a
[51:14] grown man before those who have already
[51:16] raised children but I'm speaking to the
[51:19] parents now that have younger children
[51:23] whatever you do before then that's what
[51:26] they'll do so if you show them a five
[51:29] minute religion that's what they'll do
[51:31] when they get older then you wonder why
[51:33] are my children not serving the Lord why
[51:35] don't they like to come to the house of
[51:37] God why is it that they get bored and
[51:39] sleep in the middle of the service all
[51:40] the time do you do it you're not
[51:48] speaking to myself to now brother
[51:53] Anderson if you bring these scriptures
[51:55] up
[51:56] Zephaniah 1:12 it says and it shall come
[52:00] to pass at that time that I will search
[52:03] Jerusalem with candles and punish the
[52:05] man that I'll that are settled on their
[52:08] Lee's in other words complacent that say
[52:14] in their heart the Lord will not do good
[52:16] neither will he do evil that's kind of
[52:19] the thought of people today he'll let me
[52:24] pass me by with my five-minute prayer
[52:26] and my thirty minutes that I give to him
[52:28] at church you know yeah somehow I'll get
[52:31] through it you know you'd be surprised
[52:35] Hebrews 5 chapter 5 verse 11 it says of
[52:39] whom we have many things to say and hard
[52:42] to be uttered seeing ye are dull of
[52:45] hearing saying ye are dull of hearing
[52:51] for when for the time ye ought to be
[52:53] teachers you have need that one teach
[52:55] you again which be the first principles
[52:57] of the Oracles of God and our become
[53:00] such as have need of milk and not of
[53:03] strong meat for everyone that uses milk
[53:07] is unskillful in the word of
[53:08] righteousness for he is a babe but
[53:10] strong meat bôla'
[53:12] to them that are full age even those who
[53:15] by reason of us of use have their senses
[53:17] exercised to discern both good and evil
[53:20] you have you have you had your senses to
[53:25] be exercised that way you know because
[53:30] the more yeah you know what since the
[53:32] more you give up to God the more he'll
[53:35] make you more responsible for you see
[53:38] then the one that gate that that got the
[53:41] one talent well he was supposed to get
[53:44] some interest for that you know he but
[53:47] the one they got you know the ten talent
[53:49] I was it I was at five I was about five
[53:51] max I can't remember but those that got
[53:54] the higher amount of talents they got
[53:55] more talents out of that you know got
[53:57] more interest for the master but the one
[53:59] that got that one talent he just went
[54:01] and hid it and gave it back to the
[54:05] Father and the end the end of master
[54:08] said you know we'll take what he's
[54:10] already what he's got take it away from
[54:11] him
[54:12] I don't want God to do that to me
[54:15] take away the gift that God has given in
[54:19] my life or whatever gift God has given
[54:21] you in your life because you don't use
[54:22] it for the kingdom of God you know you
[54:25] have more potential than want you then
[54:27] why then what you you know you do
[54:30] you weren't just created just to just
[54:33] sit 45 minutes sit of service and
[54:36] wanting to go home and 45 minutes
[54:41] there's more about this Christian walk
[54:43] Saints taking it by violence Isaiah 32
[54:47] verse 9
[54:48] rise up you women that are at ease hear
[54:52] my voice this is God speaking hear my
[54:55] voice you careless daughters give ear
[54:57] unto my speech many days and years shall
[54:59] be troubled ye careless women for the
[55:01] vintage shall fail the gathering shall
[55:03] not come tremble ye women that are ease
[55:07] though God was happy to see people at
[55:09] ease you know women this is Israel you
[55:14] know but the church women represents the
[55:16] church church be troubled ye careless
[55:20] ones strip you and make you bare and
[55:23] gird sackcloth upon your loins
[55:25] in other words repent Amos 6:1 woe to
[55:29] them that are at ease in Zion and Trust
[55:33] in the mountain of Samaria trust in the
[55:36] world which are named Chiefs of the
[55:39] nations to whom the house of Israel came
[55:40] in proverbs 10 verse 4 through 5 says he
[55:44] becometh poor that dealeth with a slack
[55:46] hand but the hand of the diligent maketh
[55:49] rich you know sometimes we just want to
[55:51] think about money when we read about
[55:54] this this when we read this scripture
[55:56] but I applied in all areas of life
[56:00] because one thing I admire about brother
[56:02] Dale and this has really helped me
[56:07] brother Dale has come to the point where
[56:09] he's at and this is not glorifying him
[56:11] or anything like that but he's come to
[56:13] the point where he's at because he's
[56:14] given time to it he's given time to
[56:18] study he's given and he the things that
[56:21] he reading and studying and in working
[56:25] and preaching and all these things all
[56:26] at the same time I admire him for that I
[56:29] remar him for that and it puts me as a
[56:33] young person younger than him I look up
[56:35] to him for that you know I want to be I
[56:38] want to be more like that more
[56:40] disciplined like that you know you think
[56:44] that he got do you think he got where
[56:45] he's at and you're wondering why am I
[56:47] not growing spiritually well I don't
[56:49] understand the Bible well you don't even
[56:50] pick up the Bible you don't even turn on
[56:53] a tape to listen to it you don't even
[56:56] relisted or preached at church there
[57:01] online on YouTube so I almost love to go
[57:04] to youtube and watch other things give
[57:06] time to other things but we don't give
[57:07] time to what's more important there
[57:09] services are there and you know you
[57:11] don't get everything just in one service
[57:15] now how many of us go back and relisting
[57:18] to the things that Burridge's that have
[57:20] been preached here there are a few
[57:23] because you can see how many views have
[57:25] been on there I'm wondering you know you
[57:29] wonder if it's maybe the people overseas
[57:31] they're there
[57:32] the ones that reviewing I'm challenged
[57:36] you are Saints it's time is it's going
[57:38] home time I want more of God in in in in
[57:42] in taking the kingdom on violence means
[57:44] something doing something radical in
[57:46] your life anybody that's ever made any
[57:48] change in their life is there has to
[57:50] been radical about it has to been
[57:52] radical about it
[57:54] Gandhi he made a radical decision one
[57:56] day and look where the nation of India
[57:58] now is you know that's just taking
[58:00] things you know Martin Luther King jr.
[58:02] look at that radicalness day he came
[58:04] George Washington crossing the Potomac
[58:06] River and all these the radical things
[58:08] that took place and we have the one that
[58:11] said that he'll be with us even in us to
[58:14] the end of the world and he we can't be
[58:16] radical about Jesus we just nonchalant
[58:20] about him
[58:24] Saints God God has you that's not taking
[58:29] the kingdom of violence amen
[58:33] so you know we feel that we are way past
[58:36] having to repent and travail before God
[58:38] that you don't need that anymore we're
[58:41] in the message we don't need none of
[58:43] that stuff's on the way you know we just
[58:45] read where God said that those who eat
[58:47] meat you know are the ones that have
[58:50] grown but never do we read that he's
[58:52] taking away the milk either and and even
[58:55] in Laodicea in Revelation chapter 3 when
[58:58] we he's telling the people they just see
[59:00] it to repent go back and do your first
[59:04] works over you know I've always had that
[59:07] stuck in my in my heart that and
[59:09] whenever I've gotten cold and informal
[59:12] before God and and starchy some of us
[59:17] have more starch than a big bowl of
[59:19] spaghetti tell you what when you know
[59:25] you want to praise God and you want and
[59:28] you want to get the enthused about God
[59:31] but we just you know we don't want to
[59:33] let go and let God have his way
[59:37] but you know one thing that I always
[59:40] thought wherever you leave God that's
[59:42] where you'll find him wherever you leave
[59:45] God that's where you'll find he's always
[59:47] waiting for you to come back to where
[59:49] you left him and if it was in your
[59:51] prayer life that's where you're gonna
[59:52] find him
[59:53] if it was in the reading I'm studying of
[59:55] the word that's where you'll find him if
[59:57] it was in coming to church frequently
[59:59] that's where you'll find God amen
[1:00:01] wherever you're at young people if it's
[1:00:05] obeying your parents doing what they're
[1:00:08] supposed to be doing if that's where you
[1:00:10] left God that's where you'll find God
[1:00:12] again amen amen
[1:00:16] repent though praise God so I'm gonna go
[1:00:20] a little quicker since the mechanics and
[1:00:23] the dynamics where the random we know he
[1:00:25] talked about mechanics and dynamics you
[1:00:28] know and it's important to have both the
[1:00:30] mechanics and the dynamics in order to
[1:00:32] make your vehicle run right you can have
[1:00:37] mechanics you know the other day we were
[1:00:38] at the mall and I saw Kia stepping up
[1:00:41] their game on their cars you know
[1:00:42] they're making them look really nice now
[1:00:44] it's nice and sporty and everything like
[1:00:47] that and they had this model car there
[1:00:49] in the showroom and I've thought to
[1:00:52] myself my goodness this is nice it
[1:00:53] almost looks like a Lexus you know very
[1:00:55] nice and everything I said my goodness
[1:00:58] but if they didn't have a gasoline tank
[1:01:01] to put gasoline and there's nothing it's
[1:01:04] just a bunch of shine a bunch of fluff
[1:01:06] bunch of fluff and nothing behind there
[1:01:08] nothing backing it up no spark no fire
[1:01:10] no nothing my goodness look look what
[1:01:13] brother Branham says here brother
[1:01:14] brother Anderson if you want to bring up
[1:01:16] that quote it is the rise another son
[1:01:21] that's what he proved hallelujah that's
[1:01:25] what Easter proved he wasn't only the
[1:01:26] word but he was God himself the dynamics
[1:01:29] in the word that made the body of Jesus
[1:01:32] Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave
[1:01:35] shaken to life and rise again and roll
[1:01:38] away the stone I am he that was dead so
[1:01:40] dead to the sunset he was dead the moon
[1:01:42] said he was dead the star said he was
[1:01:44] dead all nature said he was dead and now
[1:01:46] the whole world has to recognize that
[1:01:48] he's a
[1:01:48] again he was not only the mechanics
[1:01:51] God's Word he was the dynamics to prove
[1:01:53] it so he was not just a churchgoer amen
[1:01:56] he also did some things behind the
[1:01:58] scenes as well if you put it that way
[1:02:03] you do your time you do your time at
[1:02:07] home too until that church becomes both
[1:02:10] dynamics and mechanics and the Spirit of
[1:02:12] God that moved him to do the things that
[1:02:13] he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will
[1:02:16] the bride Amen for he said in John 14 12
[1:02:19] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:02:20] do shall he do also
[1:02:21] I'll give him a charge of my dynamics
[1:02:23] and his mechanics that the world will
[1:02:26] not be able to withstand it and I'll
[1:02:28] raise him up again at the last day
[1:02:29] that's the Easter message the dynamics
[1:02:32] and the mechanics together the mechanics
[1:02:35] without the dynamics no good neither is
[1:02:39] the dynamics without the mechanics look
[1:02:42] what he says here you can scream and
[1:02:44] shout and jump up and down and all you
[1:02:46] want to in the nidus word it won't do
[1:02:48] any good now we don't necessarily I'm
[1:02:51] talking to you all I'm not there no
[1:02:53] nominal Christians hear anything I'm
[1:02:55] talking to us message believers who
[1:02:57] believe God sent a prophet and believe
[1:02:59] this message they meant you can deny
[1:03:02] this word by the way you live by the way
[1:03:07] you take this word when you go back home
[1:03:09] that's need are you denying the word or
[1:03:12] are you or you for the word you can say
[1:03:15] oh I'm for the word because I've moved
[1:03:17] the church I did this and I did a little
[1:03:19] bit of something at church and I have
[1:03:21] this job at church but you go home and
[1:03:23] you do something else besides the word
[1:03:25] you don't get in that word you don't
[1:03:27] meditate in that word amen
[1:03:30] then you're denying the word you're just
[1:03:35] cranking around the Pistons off got the
[1:03:37] spark there to fire but no gasoline to
[1:03:39] fire it buy it just won't move no matter
[1:03:41] how good the mechanics is until the
[1:03:43] dynamics come when the dynamics come
[1:03:45] that fire is made to connect with that
[1:03:48] octane in the gasoline and when that
[1:03:51] explodes it causes a combustion and that
[1:03:54] combustion moves for every motion every
[1:03:56] move for he is the same yesterday today
[1:03:58] and forever
[1:03:59] that's the resurrection that's the real
[1:04:01] power of God
[1:04:02] Kanaks with the dynamics notice is the
[1:04:04] spirit that quickeneth it's the spark
[1:04:06] that fires is not the gas that fires is
[1:04:08] to spark that fires the gas amen and
[1:04:12] that spark is the Holy Ghost amen
[1:04:19] you know the spark the Holy Ghost can
[1:04:21] only move a man as much as you feed it
[1:04:25] because he's not gonna feed off
[1:04:27] television and he's not gonna feed off
[1:04:29] the internet and YouTube videos and
[1:04:30] Facebook and Instagram and whatever is
[1:04:34] out there that's not what the Holy Ghost
[1:04:36] feeds off of how it goes feeds off this
[1:04:40] word amen
[1:04:42] and so it's so logical if the word is in
[1:04:45] you if the Holy Ghost is in you that's
[1:04:48] what you want to feed off right but if
[1:04:52] that desire is not in you then something
[1:04:54] is wrong
[1:04:56] something something's wrong you need to
[1:04:58] be at this altar I need to be at this
[1:05:00] altar repenting or whatever altar it is
[1:05:03] at your home or whatever do something
[1:05:06] amen be violent about God Saints amen
[1:05:10] follow falling amen
[1:05:15] you know Charles Spurgeon III like his
[1:05:18] his messages you know he he preached
[1:05:21] some really good salvations messages but
[1:05:23] this is what he had to say about about
[1:05:25] violin he preached the message in 1859
[1:05:28] called holy violence and look what he
[1:05:32] said if he burned bring brother Anderson
[1:05:34] wanna bring that okay he's got it but
[1:05:37] this violence does not end when a man
[1:05:39] finds Christ it then begins to exercise
[1:05:42] itself in another way the man who is
[1:05:45] pardoned and who knows it then becomes
[1:05:47] violently in love with Christ he does
[1:05:50] not love him just a little but he loves
[1:05:54] him with all his soul and all his might
[1:05:56] he feels as if he could wish to die for
[1:05:59] Christ do you feel that way and his
[1:06:04] heart pants to be able to live alone
[1:06:06] with his Redeemer and serve Him without
[1:06:09] interruption that's why that's why I
[1:06:12] questioned when when you want to
[1:06:15] get out of here in 45 minutes I question
[1:06:19] things like that
[1:06:19] mark such a man who is a true Christian
[1:06:22] mark his prayers and you will see there
[1:06:25] is violence in all his supplications
[1:06:27] when he pleads for the souls of man mark
[1:06:30] his outward actions and they are
[1:06:32] violently sincere violently earnest mark
[1:06:35] him when he preaches
[1:06:36] there is no dull droning out of his
[1:06:38] monotonous discourse he speaks like a
[1:06:41] man who means what he says and who must
[1:06:43] speak it or else whoa would be unto him
[1:06:47] if he preached not the gospel now look
[1:06:49] what he says here in 1859 as I look
[1:06:52] around on many of the churches yay on
[1:06:54] many members of my own church I am apt
[1:06:57] to fear that they are not of God's
[1:06:59] children at all because they have
[1:07:02] nothing of this holy violence what would
[1:07:08] we say about about this day and that was
[1:07:11] in 1859 before we had internet what
[1:07:14] would he say about this day before we
[1:07:17] had cell phones before we had all these
[1:07:19] commodities that we have and that we
[1:07:21] enjoy and I thank God for all these
[1:07:23] things but that take our time so that we
[1:07:25] don't get violent about God now when the
[1:07:34] three thousand in the upper room after
[1:07:38] Peter and the disciples they received
[1:07:40] the Holy Ghost let's just read acts 2
[1:07:42] verse 37 they were pricked at their
[1:07:46] hearts the Bible says now when they
[1:07:48] heard this after Peter gave them a whole
[1:07:50] you know they experienced the new birth
[1:07:53] you know after they everything that
[1:07:56] Jesus spoke to them and they received in
[1:07:58] three and a half years it was quick and
[1:08:00] they meant the Holy Ghost came and what
[1:08:02] happens when the Holy Ghost comes Amen
[1:08:04] it brings the word you desire the word
[1:08:06] amen now when they heard this they were
[1:08:10] pricked in their heart and said unto
[1:08:12] Peter now it's interesting how he says
[1:08:15] it pricked in their heart in other words
[1:08:17] it cut them at their hearts it was
[1:08:19] violent to them amen it wasn't just
[1:08:22] something oh oh oh just kind of
[1:08:24] nonchalantly took place no it pricked
[1:08:26] them it caught it made them it really
[1:08:28] cut them amen and said unto Peter and to
[1:08:31] the rest of the Apostles they did
[1:08:33] something about this man and brethren
[1:08:34] what shall we do then Peter said unto
[1:08:40] them repent and be baptized every one of
[1:08:42] you alright we know these scriptures
[1:08:44] verse 40 and with many other words did
[1:08:47] he testify and exhort saying save
[1:08:49] yourselves from this untoward generation
[1:08:51] then they that gladly received
[1:08:54] I always wondered you know what happened
[1:08:56] to the three thousand because we always
[1:08:57] think what happened you know to them
[1:08:59] didn't but but this is what this is what
[1:09:01] they did then they that gladly received
[1:09:03] his word were baptized and the same day
[1:09:06] there were added unto them about 3,000
[1:09:09] souls and look what it says and they
[1:09:10] continued steadfastly in the Apostles
[1:09:14] doctrine and fellowship and in breaking
[1:09:17] of bread and in prayers
[1:09:20] I don't read here where it says that
[1:09:23] they fell asleep at church and they
[1:09:27] never studied at home you know then they
[1:09:30] continued steadfastly in the Apostles
[1:09:35] doctrine and the Apostles doctrine
[1:09:37] wasn't their doctrine it was Jesus
[1:09:39] Christ's doctrine amen
[1:09:40] so that's they were steadfast in the
[1:09:43] doctrine of Christ and fellowship and in
[1:09:46] breaking of bread and in prayers amen
[1:09:49] that was their desire that there's ours
[1:09:52] changed so they took some radical
[1:09:54] changes
[1:09:55] amen and you know in John 8 verse 31 it
[1:10:01] says Jesus saying this he says then said
[1:10:04] Jesus to those Jews which believed on
[1:10:06] him you if ye continue in my word then
[1:10:09] are ye my disciples indeed we continue
[1:10:14] in the word if you're not just satisfied
[1:10:18] with just a small portion but you're you
[1:10:22] want more of God then are you my
[1:10:25] disciples indeed
[1:10:27] amen Jesus saying this and ye shall know
[1:10:31] the truth and the truth shall make you
[1:10:34] free
[1:10:35] Christ said that Christ said that when
[1:10:37] you receive the Holy Ghost he shall lead
[1:10:40] you and guide you unto all truth
[1:10:42] amen and the Holy Ghost is his word amen
[1:10:45] so if you desire the word Amen you're
[1:10:47] gonna know more of him you're gonna know
[1:10:50] more about about truth you're gonna know
[1:10:52] about what it is that brother Dale is
[1:10:54] talking about here on Sunday morning
[1:10:56] what brother wait is talking about what
[1:10:58] these ministers are right here are
[1:10:59] talking about you're gonna know more
[1:11:01] you're gonna why because your steadfast
[1:11:04] amen you're continuing in his word amen
[1:11:07] now since that's violent because that
[1:11:14] that takes dying of yourself in order
[1:11:17] for you to do that
[1:11:19] and if you don't die to yourself
[1:11:21] violently then you won't have the
[1:11:23] blessings of the word in your life it's
[1:11:27] simple amen now finishing up here amen
[1:11:32] you remember when revelations aim in
[1:11:35] chapter 10 when when John and he was he
[1:11:40] was a the mighty angel but this angel
[1:11:43] came down from heaven we'll just read it
[1:11:45] here it says and I saw another mighty
[1:11:47] angel come down from heaven clothed with
[1:11:49] a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:11:52] and his face was as it were the Sun and
[1:11:54] his feet as pillars of fire we know
[1:11:56] that's Jesus amen and we know and look
[1:12:01] what it says and he had in his hand a
[1:12:02] little book open amen you and I are
[1:12:08] reading out of an open book Saints in

[1:12:34] see at age why why are you so laxa Daisy
[1:12:38] and so lazy in the ad in his little hand

[1:12:44] from heaven spake unto me again and said

[1:12:48] which is open in the hand of the angel
[1:12:51] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:12:54] earth so the angel amen the voice which
[1:12:58] I heard from heaven told him to go take
[1:13:00] the book amen and look what verse 9 says
[1:13:05] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[1:13:09] him give me the little book so he came
[1:13:12] over there you know and made me a little

[1:15:55] you you you take these problems what is
[1:15:57] what counts I know but we're always
[1:16:00] going to have problems especially when

[1:16:35] know John represents the bride amen we
[1:16:39] are to prophesy again I mean we are to
[1:16:42] speak this word amen this word is not
[1:16:45] just gonna stay in in book form not just
[1:16:48] stay in in the mechanical form and tapes
[1:16:50] it's got to be living Saints in you and
[1:16:53] me Saints it's got to be living the
[1:16:57] world will only recognize a Living Bible
[1:17:03] not a not not just scriptures not that
[1:17:06] you can show them something in the word
[1:17:08] a Living Bible lived out Bible but if
[1:17:12] you don't like to read the word and if
[1:17:14] you don't want the out
[1:17:15] tunity to speak to other people about
[1:17:16] the word then you won't get you won't
[1:17:19] get that privilege now we'll finish up
[1:17:22] with this brother Brad Anderson bring
[1:17:24] that accepting God's provided way at the
[1:17:27] end time 1963 that goes for God's
[1:17:31] children
[1:17:32] I could parallel that for you a man get
[1:17:34] up on say chew his chewing gum real well
[1:17:38] you know this this is a man it may be at
[1:17:40] church you know she was chewing gum real
[1:17:44] well you know father I'm here tonight if
[1:17:46] you want to give me the Holy Ghost all
[1:17:48] right I'm here but if you want to heal
[1:17:51] me I'm setting here but if you don't why
[1:17:54] all right it's your will Lord he's done
[1:17:57] wrote the will out here in the Bible it
[1:18:00] is his will to heal you it is his will
[1:18:03] to give you the Holy Ghost this is if
[1:18:05] you want it violently or not do you want
[1:18:07] to violently take the kingdom or not all
[1:18:10] right this is his will right here and if
[1:18:11] you want me to have it I'll have it but
[1:18:14] nevertheless if you don't why it's all
[1:18:16] right is that the attitude sometimes
[1:18:20] that we take
[1:18:21] you'll never get nowhere brother Branham
[1:18:23] says but let that one get there and cry
[1:18:26] out like buddy Robinson he stopped in
[1:18:29] the middle of the cornfield he tied up
[1:18:31] his mule he said Lord if you don't give
[1:18:33] me the Holy Ghost when you come back
[1:18:34] you'll find the pile of bones laying
[1:18:36] right here
[1:18:37] that sounds pretty violent to me that's
[1:18:40] pretty radical that he was willing to do
[1:18:43] that are we willing to do something like
[1:18:45] that no because we have to go to work in
[1:18:48] the morning I'm going to stay here till
[1:18:50] I get it that's business and God wants
[1:18:55] to mean business with you God always
[1:18:58] recommends to his people his believing
[1:19:00] children to always go in his provided
[1:19:02] way that's God's idea to recommend to
[1:19:06] his children his provided way cry for
[1:19:08] what you have need of he wants you to
[1:19:10] cry out to amen praise God
[1:19:14] Thanks I want I want I want to have that
[1:19:17] like feeling like that brother buddy
[1:19:19] Robinson Amen Lord he blessed me with
[1:19:22] this word you blessed me with with your
[1:19:24] Holy Ghost say whatever whatever it
[1:19:26] takes to take what this
[1:19:28] out of my life a meant that I could be
[1:19:31] more like you than do it that's what I
[1:19:35] desire amen
[1:19:37] that's pretty violent you know Jesus
[1:19:40] spoke about Jesus talked about you know
[1:19:42] if your eye makes you sin cut your eye
[1:19:44] out I smiling if your foot make you sand
[1:19:51] cut your foot off that's pretty violent
[1:19:55] that's radical on your part now we know
[1:19:58] he's speaking spiritually you know but
[1:20:02] what he's saying is don't be laxed about
[1:20:05] this you take radical measures you want
[1:20:08] God you take radical measures about God
[1:20:11] you want more of Christ you want more of
[1:20:13] his word take radical measures take
[1:20:17] radical measures Saints amen I hope that
[1:20:20] something was said this evening that
[1:20:21] that that will that will and motivate
[1:20:23] you encourage you amen
[1:20:26] in in spark a fire under you amen and
[1:20:30] and take the things that are being said
[1:20:33] today in in the last several services
[1:20:36] and things and really ponder about these
[1:20:40] things not just take him as just another
[1:20:43] service just another you know routine
[1:20:46] type of thing and my goodness ask
[1:20:51] yourself am i closer to God then I was
[1:20:53] five years ago
[1:20:54] last year even last week and if you're
[1:20:58] not then get violent with God that's the
[1:21:03] only way and it's not necessarily I mean
[1:21:05] you get you take the kingdom a man yes
[1:21:08] but it's mostly it is mainly the kingdom
[1:21:12] getting inside of you amen praise God
[1:21:15] because if the kingdom doesn't get
[1:21:17] inside of you you won't get you don't
[1:21:19] you won't get you know Christ said that
[1:21:24] what is what is it he said he that
[1:21:28] coming out that draw they draw with him
[1:21:31] they forgot the scripture now it'll come
[1:21:35] to me anyways you won't come to Christ
[1:21:38] unless he draws you first that's what it
[1:21:40] is
[1:21:42] that's right there it is right there for
[1:21:45] the day thank you and so if you don't
[1:21:47] feel that putt at pool you don't feel
[1:21:49] that tug you don't feel that you know
[1:21:51] then then you're just here with peacock
[1:21:53] feathers on your on your Buzzard carcass
[1:21:56] right but a true Christian wants more of
[1:22:00] Christ amen praise God so let's have the

[1:37:00] come if you can come you will come we
[1:37:07] knows we know that certain people you
[1:37:09] know it's tough for them and that's
[1:37:10] understanding but if you're close by and
[1:37:13] you don't come yeah when you can that
[1:37:19] that's part of taking the kingdom by
[1:37:20] force
[1:37:21] violently that's another radical thing

[1:37:48] minute or what you know he's it's just
[1:37:51] he needs Christ and but claiming it

[1:37:57] mother-in-law cuz you know she was a
[1:37:58] believer I believe she was claiming him
[1:38:01] in his salvation and and so we're just
