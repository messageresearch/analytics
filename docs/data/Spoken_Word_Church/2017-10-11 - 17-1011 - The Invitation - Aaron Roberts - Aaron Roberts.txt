the Lord it's not it's not big or bulky I can take it off a lot a lot easier than that brace and it's just a lot better and I've started physical therapy and you know you remember the the old saying about pain is just weakness leaving the body I keep trying to think that in my mind I told my said I don't know such a little person could put inflict so much pain on you but they know exactly where you hurt and that's where they're gonna stick their fingers and I didn't realize that I did not realize I thought they'd work on my elbow which is what out you know I've been stretching trying to stretch my elbow and they told me that it's not gonna work because all the muscles in your body have to work in unison and so I found out that they work every other muscle in your arm but your elbow and so I didn't realize that those were as needed and I didn't realized they were in the condition they were in until I started pushing and prodding and twisting and the low lady she grabbed hold of my arm and she grabbed the back of my elbow here and she pushed down on my hand right here and I thought I was going through the ceiling but I think the Lord it's working out and yester see today's winds so I went Monday to the doctor and it won't tell you something else she worked on my arm for an hour and a half and it was almost completely straight when she got done with it and that was that was an amazing thing because when you're standing there and you're holding your arms out and it's almost straight and you can see that you know it's coming along and people were amazed it was a young man who was an intern there he's going to school for fiscal therapy and he told me he was amazed he said you know somebody that with your incision looks so well he said that looks like somebody's incision that's you know months down the road because it just looks so well he was amazed that it's only been too much that's my surgery and I'm doing so well and everybody and my physical therapist she's just she just amazed she's you know what she till now I am I mean she's impressed with my progress she said because she's got a patient that broke her arm has messed up her elbow and she can't get she get a little bit I guess beyond 45 degrees from 90 degrees just a little bit and she she's been doing that for months since she can't get any further than that and I've been I've been in physical therapy three times and I've almost got my arm completely straight so just want to thank the Lord for that and I still can't you know claim the blood and he's still he's still the healer amen so we're just looking the scripture here too late tonight Luke chapter 14 you know we're gonna begin to verse 16 and that's just all bow our heads tonight and speak to the author for we read the scripture our heavenly father Lord Jesus we're just so thankful for Lord another opportunity to be in your house Lord together with saints of what precious faith and father I just pray tonight you just come on the scene and or just help me get out of the way and you just come on the scene and speak Lord just use these lips to speak something that would be an encouragement to help to the people tonight Lord Jesus and father we just pray for each need this represented in the building tonight Lord as many that own our hearts and our minds inordinate or do you know that need a touch from you though we we know that you're the waymaker Lord you know what everybody needs in each situation and Lord we just commit them to you and know that you'll work them out in your time in your way because what we think may be right Lord we know that can be wrong but whatever you do we know is perfect and we just commit it to you and we just thank you for it tonight and we just pray that you just bless the little bride around the world and father just for each one that you know the needs we just commit them to you and we just thank you for it and just bless the word tonight busted hear those that hear tonight Lord Jesus and ones on the internet the different ones that be listening to it later on Lord we just pray that and Lord it'll be a blessing to them we just pray to committed all things and do you in your hands and name of Jesus Christ amen amen Luke chapter 14 forgetting was 16 and it says then said and unto him a certain man made a supper and bade many and sent his servant that supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first sent unto Him I have bought a piece of ground it must needs to go and see it and I pray thee have me excused I thought of you and another set of yoke of oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee have me excused and another set I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come so that so that servant came and showed his Lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maned and the halt and the blind and the service said Lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of these men which were bidden shall taste of my supper Amen god bless you may be seated and a little thought speaking on the an invitation and brother Branham says in the message God's provided way he says and we the bride or the one that's invited the bride would be the whole world is invited everybody's invited but there's some things that we've got to do before we can ever attend the wedding supper and he goes on talks about the Orient and how they when they hand out the invitations then they have to have the wedding garments and he says I don't believe that there has ever been a man or a woman that ever walked into a church or come into the presence of God without they were given an invitation to this supper now you can take it or you can turn it down that's up to you he says some people go to church year after year and day after day revival after revival and still not accept the invitation they don't mean to turn it down they just neglect doing it and he says the people say in Canaan go on he says and people say the people that's got the Holy Ghost brag too much about it he said we can't brag enough about it there's something to crow about we're invited to the wedding supper of the son of God it's worth walking on the street and testifying and telling every creature you come in contact with what a good thing it is that you're invited to the wedding supper God Almighty has selected you from the slums of the earth to attend the wedding supper of his beloved son Oh what an invitation that is it's worth a hundred billion president suppers to attend that suffer so and then continuing on and brother brems speaking on president eisenhower and having a you know being what a great thing it would be to be invited to the presidential supper and everything like that but he's talking about the being called and he says don't worry say well I've just been a lukewarm church member he will take care of it see you just heed to that invitation you say what is the invitation whosoever will let him come and drink of the waters of life really the invitation to whosoever will so I just wanted to start out with that this and you know we've been given a great opportunity and one of the things I was thinking about was you know just have just had my high school reunion and we were in North Carolina I was in North Carolina over the weekend and you know trying to trying to prep you know trying to prepare to have a reunion and you send out invitations or any kind of function where you're where you're sending out invitations you know it's it's a lot of work and you and there's a lot of planning involved but lots of times you get no response you know you and and just hearing the scripture you know this man is having this great wedding supper this great feast and he's having this great occasion and he's trying to get people to come in and nobody's interested and you know many people have heard but no but you know people don't respond you know we had this reunion in which people had many invitations that were given out and a little funny thing about Facebook is if you send out an invitation if you create a an invite the event on there and you sent out invitations if you get that invitation and you look at that invitation guess what the people that sent the invitations know that you've seen it and it's pretty amazing because you've got all these people and there's a number of people that never look at it a lot of people don't even know there's that function I don't think they even know that function exists on Facebook but a lot of people they've see it and you try to get in touch with them and they still don't contact you and it's like well I know you've seen it and you know and there's a lot of people you know they just say they just think well I may come I may come well you know all right are you gonna be if you're gonna decide in a week a month you know the day before when are you going to decide and your brother branham sit here you know it's not that people turn turned down that invitation he said they just neglect to do it and many people they pick that but they never decide yes or no or maybe or what but when it comes to time you know are you going to make that are you going to accept that invitation because an invitation is maiden and brother branham said that nobody has ever come to church that they hadn't heard and many people have received an invitation but have you accepted that invitation and it's not and it's not just that as brother Aaron was speaking of this wedding supper it's not just that we've come to a church and we've accepted the message or you know we've come to a certain spot but you know are you continuing home because that because that invitation is still given to you every every church service every day are you going to continue in the word are you continuing on you know one of the things that struck me is that I was listening to brother Ryan and Sunday school would and you know just how thoughts just come through your mind and just you know people's like how do you get from this point to that point well you know everybody's mind works a little different but you know everybody works in a different track you know but you know I was thinking you know we've had people that have heard the truth and you know I don't know I don't you know I'm not saying that they're not born again but I'm saying there's people in the message that have only stopped at a certain point you know and brother Brent them you know he nailed the Pentecostals he said because they cabbage down on the new birth they got to one point and they just stopped and he said you know he said they and we're going to I've got a quote to read later on but you know he said you know they have refused a further impregnation of the word they refused to go on it wasn't that the word wasn't there it wasn't they need to receive the invitation but they didn't receive it they didn't accept it and many times you know the word has went forth but what is a word we accept the invitation and you know many times you know when people talk about certain things they talk about an anointing you know is it just an anointing on a person or is it an indwelling no are we looking for an indwelling are we looking just to be anointed but you know many times people don't even know what they're asking for when they when they ask you you know because people pray to be anointed but what are you what are you really mean because people people don't even people are on you know they're confused about what they're really wanting and many times people have never even come to a place to actually find out what to even ask why they're you know to know what they're asking for or what they want to ask for it's like people trying to ask questions sometimes people say well I know what I want to say but I don't know how to say it we're gonna like struggling because there's something in their mind but they don't know how to phrase it for people to understand what they're wanting but I honestly believe the thing is is if you seek God then God will give you he will number one he put somebody behind this pulpit that can exactly answer your question will tell you exactly and you don't even have to ask but say the thing is a saying is the is the Holy Spirit on the inside or even if you're not born again but the Holy Spirit if the Holy Spirit is dealing with you then the Holy Spirit is there to lead you and you oh you got to do is pray to God and God will hit the spirit the Bible tells us that the Spirit will intervene for us because while the Spirit knows what you desire even though you may not know because it even makes groanings intercession for me that we don't understand but there's the Spirit is there but many times people don't ever get to the place where they actually sit down and just you know even if you know just sit and think and say lord I don't know what I won't I don't know what I need but you do yeah because you know if we go back to what Jesus said in the garden you know he said you know he said not my wheel Lord but thine be done you know because he had he had a situation that he did not want a face but you know he said Lord not my will but thine be done and many times we could just pray the same thing Lord I don't know what I need but you do and you just give me what I need Lord just fill me up because I'm searching for something you know I was listening to brother Brent and he was talking about in his life story you know he was trying to find God trying to nail something on the tree or you know trying to figure out exactly how to hold his hands trying to find out exactly how do you how do you communicate with God what is it but you know it was something on the inside that was reaching out but you know what he kept searching and he kept searching and he kept searching and you know what there came a time when the Holy Spirit come to him and spoke to him exactly what he had need of you know if we have if we have an invitation that's been given to us you know whatever it is the Holy Spirit is here to meet your need but do you have but you know the thing is it may be well maybe you have to get by yourself maybe we have to get along maybe we just need to separate and I know it's difficult there's not a minister in this building knows it any time you sit down to try to get a thought and try to get quiet that's when everybody else needs you it's just like you know it's you know you can have nothing on your mind you can sit there for for a solid hour and you can't get nothing it's just as dry and it's dead and it's cold as anything but let me tell you what the spirit of quicken something to you and before you can get a pen there'll be ten people in front of you trying to stop you and it's like y'all gotta get stops up something you're trying to remember exactly what come to your mind and it's just you know and it's the same way you try to pray pray and you know what you don't have nothing I mean you know you it's just going out your lips and falling down you know you just you're getting anything but as soon as soon as the spirit starts to move and it just feels like you're breaking into a room you're communicating with God it just feels like you the spirits starting to move I mean the phone rings there's always something your kids who need something it's always something going on even when you're at work and you the Bible says to pray without ceasing you know and you know a lot of people what does that mean means you it means you praying all the time you know I read what Stonewall Jackson said about that you know brother Bram said Stonewall Jackson said that he didn't take a drink of water with without thinking God about it do you know you if you read what Stonewall Jackson actually said you know he said he said it's just as natural as me to open my mouth to drink water he said that's how natural it was for me to thank God for the water he said it's become such a part of me he said I can't he said if I couldn't thank God for the water he saw I couldn't open my mouth it was just it was just that natural he said he said when I open a letter he said he said I prayed to God he said prepare me for the contents in this letter he said I pray for the person if I'm sending a letter he's the one who told at Virginia Military Institute he said before I went in the classroom he said I prayed for me and the students he said prepare them for the lecture and prepare me for them and everything and he said it was just natural just as natural as getting up out of bed and thanking God for the day it was just he said everything is just prayer hey someone because it was just because but if you do that everyday you're communicating with God and a lot of people they think that's so hard to do but sometimes we let little simple things you know confuse us or you think that's a big thing but it's not but if we can just communicate with God God's there to meet our need and speak to us but I know sometimes it's just like it work you try to you know you go around and there's times where I'm just hadn't been as much now but you know in the past it's just been me and the birds on the roof you know working on air conditioners is not a whole lot around but being the birds and in the bug sometimes but you know and just pray you know and it's just a wonderful time sometimes it's just human God but you know sometimes it's when the Lord goes to speak to you that's when that's when ever you know you start having problems and that was there you know because he knows when God's trying to speak to you and you know sometimes people take that as well you know the Lord didn't want me to have that no sometimes that's what the Lord that's when the Lord is really trying to give you something and the devil knows that the Lord's trying to speak to you and he don't want you to do that he wants to get in your way that's reason we have to keep pressing the battle but the devil the devil is there to stop us but we have to keep pressing but God is there to meet our need he's there and he's in and you know he is always welcoming and it's up to us to welcome that invitation there's like we've been reading the scripture about grieve not this the Spirit of God you know he's there but many times it's us that grieve him away today's there to speak to us and wanting to speak to us and can we you know so what can we make time for him and open up because that's the greatest thing to hear from God because God wants to speak to us but you know he's made that invitation but you know the invitation is went out but it's it's wherever you're at God has an invitation for you to come up a little bit higher to continue on but you many people you know that they have failed and you know something some people just get to justification or they get to sanctification or they you know they get to a certain spot you know it's sad because there are people God God has placed people you know and whether anybody believes it or not and likes it or what you know but I believe we have this one of the greatest ministries on the face of the earth here now know everything you know people you know I know people think you know you shouldn't brag or whatever you know that's all right if I did if I didn't if I didn't think this was great I'd go somewhere else I'd find someplace else to be but you know the thing is is when we see people and if it don't break your heart I don't I don't know what will but you know there there's people that have been around and heard this invitation that's heard the word and and you know and even had people that actually said these things out of their mouth talk about how great the ministry isn't you know what never darken the door yeah never it never come around and you know it's set up and you know I've been trying to last last a little while I've been listening to brother Dale seals I've been in the truck I just been trying to keep lit you know keep listening to them but you know it it's amazing to see you know all these years and you know I it really means something to me but you know I think I was a kid when brother Dale was preaching all this but you go in there and you hear what he has to say and it's just so illuminating sometimes and you know and and it's to see what what has happened and that people have not taken this the word that's been preached and and in in Matthew chapter 22 when in the marriage and the scripture that talks about this this marriage feast you know the scripture says that they made light of his invitation and not only did they make light of his invitation but his they killed his servants and destroyed everything and you know I said that this great invitation has been made and been given and you know people have not received it and you know and we can fall in that same same category but you always sad to see how many people have not received it and I think it's I think it's wonderful I you know it's changed my life and I'm not and it's not a man and it's not it's not men it's not flesh but I believe it's been the Spirit of God I believe I believe the Spirit of God has come why because that's exactly what the Prophet told us was going to do what's going to take place why because he you know and and people say well you know we need to stay away from them do things that we just need to get down where we live well let me tell you something and then you know I I have a hard time with that statement because let me tell you something down where we live is exactly what the seals and the 70 weeks of Daniel and all of these other things exactly what they come to do is get down exactly where you live that is exactly where you live why because you're still living in this past house still under the bondage of Satan while this flesh you're still going to have all of the whole Satan still got a hold on you one because if we don't come to us to the place where we can overcome death then you know I will go to the grave none of it none of us are promised the rest of this day or tomorrow but there's been a word been given to us that we can overcome the power of Satan and come overcome death but he's so we got to get down where we live we're gonna know what every day you're getting older you know I might have a whole bunch of metal in this arm right here but you know I'm not taking it with me you know what I mean because there's some things that happen in life and we don't know why but you know what the Bible tells me that all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord who RV called according to his purpose somebody asked me so why is it that you broke your arm why because I can testify and show the healing power of Jesus Christ why because I can walk into a place and people be amazed at how well I've come and I said you know what mister because of the prayer because it's faith in Jesus Christ because it's why His Word says that I'm by strikes I'm healed you know what he didn't become he didn't come overnight he won the miracle but that's not divine healing divine healing is a process divine healing takes time but the thing is is can you see because when people come up to you and they're amazed at your progress that's the power of God and that's and that's what we face today that's what we have today but let me tell you something it's not just healings it's not just miracles it's not just signs but it's the opening of the word why because there's one thing they you can have people who can do lots of miracles and signs and there's lots of healing take place but there's one thing they can't reproduce there's one thing the devil can't impersonate and that's the opening of the word he can't copy that there's anything is this do we take the word do we take the word and actually apply it to our lives this is from the message is your life worthy of the gospel brother Branham says now Jesus here is saying man has tried to make excuses not to receive God's word of his invitation he said though it be proved firmly proven to them it's his supper and his invitation but man constantly making excuses and he says if you may read Matthew 22 you'll find the excuses and and he goes on and talks about what's happened and he said drops down he says now we see when God gives a man an invitation to do something or receive the invitation that he's given him and he returns it down there's nothing left after mercy is spurred but judgment he said if he step over the boundaries of mercy then there's only one thing left and that is judgment and we find that man has done that in all the ages it happens most every age in the Bible but you know he's given us that invitation to receive the word nevah and you know we know that as you receive the words you become the word we become the word and what what is it what is it for us to do is because we are to be manifest because brother Bram says it that God wanted to be to be made manifest so Christ came to be the fullness of the Godhead bodily and flesh on the earth and he said the bride became an extension of that or brought Christ in another form became he said because Christ was the word that he said the bride is to the bride is to be manifest why because what what Christ come to manifest he said I do nothing except what I see the father do he said the son can do nothing in himself he said big self what he sees the father do he said that doeth the son likewise and he said that's what applies to the bride because the same word that applies to the bridegroom also applies to the bride so if what he spoke of Jesus because Jesus said I come to make him known and that's what the bride is to make known is to make him known well because that is that is then the day that we live one because that's what he wants to be made known because what he spoke of is that Jesus Christ will be here on the earth again but many times when we when we say that you know well is that just in part are we just seeing part of that or do we actually see do we realize that the body is to manifest the whole Jesus Christ in his fullness and I mean I may not be the one that's going to express him in his fullness but I want to be the fullness of my part because you know I see when you understand when when brethren said that all that God was he poured into Christ when you understand what what eternity is when you understand the eternal when when you see these things and maybe I don't see it the way out - but I see what I see I'm I live in that but you know it's when you see when you see something that's eternal and you know we talk about something being infinite well you know the thing is is you know when he said all that God was he poured into Christ well if something that's infinite you can you can divide what you can do whatever you won't do to it and it doesn't diminish it he said when he said all that God was he poured into Christ were you know what that became another form of seeing the infinite God but you know what he didn't diminish him in any capacity all he done was you know you're seeing him in a greater form you're seeing him in a greater way and then when he pours it into the bride the bride doesn't diminish him he said you're seeing Jesus Christ in a greater way so when we come to church brothers and sisters when we see a brother or sister that's coming into the and has come into this folders come into this fellowship then you know what it's a great thing one because I'm seeing Jesus Christ in a greater form I've seen Jesus Christ in a greater manifestation now we can look at each other's faults and failures and see all the warts and all the other bad things and and look at the the honda parts as the scripture says but you know what we can also see Jesus Christ being made manifest in a person if we can you know wasn't the last time I preached I was talking about the the great family reunion you know the we are we are we thrilled and I understand what brother Branham said you know he said if if you have the Spirit of God inside of he said you can't wait to get into those doors and to fellowship with your brothers and sisters you know you can't wait to fellowship with people and it's not just here but I mean actually just fellowship with the brothers and sisters in Christ no matter where it is and you know when I went to my high school reunion it was it was nice to see them to see people and and there were people that I got to see and we got to fellowship with and and you know it's just almost like time hadn't passed I mean it's just like we're all wait ten years old again I mean it's just you know it's so great but you know what I sit there and you know what there's nothing in this realm because you sit there and even as great as that reunion was to see these people you know what it doesn't it doesn't compare to having your brothers and sisters in Christ even to meet somebody that you've never seen in this flesh and you know one of the one of the people that really stands out to me as brother sampson shetty and the first time he coming you know it was just like it was just like we just just bonded the first time I ever met him and you know it's just it's just something you know and and you know we've talked a lot you know over Facebook and you know different times and but you know every time he comes it's just like this great fellowship and you know it you know even though I don't you know you don't see them you see pictures and you you you know send messages back and forth and and those type things but you know what when they've come to when you see them in the flesh I mean it's just and you know and it's sometimes when they come and you meet them for the first time you've never seen them but you know what you know that your that your brothers and sisters and they have a you know because you realize that the same life that's inside of you lives in them and I mean that's just it's so great and you know you can you can have these great times but you know it just you know you just see one of these days that is waiting for somebody you know we got to get ourselves ready to get out of here by because there's a time coming that we're gonna have this fellowship why because all of the saints that have gone home and all the saints that are around the world you know we're gonna have an eternal fellowship we're all going to get together we're gonna have this great reunion and you know it's going to be a great time and you know that's what I'm waiting Otis is to get together with our brothers and sisters but you know that that's the time that we're in now is you know he stirs you up sometimes we go you know that's that's a wonderful thing to realize because you know I'm ready to get out of here I'm ready to put all this behind me you know how many want to get up and go to work in the morning yeah I'm ready put all that behind me you know all right you know even even just to get out in the just getting out of bed in the morning you know just having to do with any of the the things that we have to do deal with and all in this pest house having to get old and you know problems and everything I'm ready to put all that behind us but brother Grimm says in the mrs. endtime Sun seed he says we believe that Christ is God's Word made manifest we believe that his bride must be the same thing we believe that she must believe every bit of the word and have that word in her because she is part of the body she is the body where he is the head he said when he died rose from the dead and resurrect and set on high by the majesty of God on his throne right hand of the Majesty then we are his delegate so we reckon ourselves dead and buried by baptism and raised with him and now seated together with him in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that get us all shouting wouldn't it think of that we are not will be we are now we are sons of God now we are daughters of God not we will be seated we are now seated hey you know many times it says that we are reckon ourselves dead with him you know mate how we get in our in our in our lives and you know there's people that you know that they wonder if you know if they're doing anything for God or can they do anything for God or you know you know because they see people's you know they don't have a great ministry or they don't get to do certain things or whatever but you know are you faithful in what God's called you to be you know because when brother Ram talks about the great things in God he said you know it's just a wash woman washing clothes or a man going to work you know these type things do can't people see Christ in you and you know there's a as a story and I've told this story before and and it always it always stands out to me and you know there was a in the second world world war it was a the Allies had a campaign and they were trying to feed false information to the enemy and they couldn't do it so somebody come up with an idea that the way they wanted to do it was they wanted to take a dead man and faked his you know faked his death like he was a soldier and everything and he was supposed to have these papers on him and that Hitler and the Axis powers they would get these papers from from this dead man and they would take them and you know they would try to decipher them and they would think all this stuff well they kept trying to find a man and they made it look like the man had drowned well they the man had actually died of pneumonia and they took this man and what was so amazing about this man was this man in his life he felt like he never never amounted to anything and you know it was just the the mindset that he had in his life it end up killing him because you know what he never believed he could mount to anything and everything was against him and he had all these problems and you know what he ended up dying and you know what when this man died the Allied powers of the world took this dead man they dressed him up in an army uniform they gave him a new name they gave him all these different classifications and everything they took him they threw him in the ocean well next thing you know all these access powers these different foreign governments they're out there finding him and they start pulling them in they sell these papers like oh man we've rarely found something well the Allied Zhou lay down would start sending their spies around trying to find out trying to make like they were really searching for these papers well the enemy thought men they were really wanting these papers they must be something of value well they go and get these papers and Hitler actually believes these papers are really real but actually it come to be false but you know what they actually took those and it actually helped when we had the Normandy landing on d-day it actually led to that Hitler moving his troops out of the way so that they could actually land in certain areas and it was so amazing was this man he thought that he'd never amount to anything he couldn't do anything but you know what when that man died he could actually be something and actually be used to somebody and I always think of that you know because you know what our problem is is we're not dead we want to be used of God but you know what until you doubt God can't use you and you know other thing is is when you die you can get a new name you can get put in the army of God and God can use you but the thing is is you've got to die out why because as long as we're still alive we still got the old mindset we still got our stinking thinking that come from creation but the thing is is went from our first birth but the thing is is when we die old we'll get a get a rebirth that we get a new way of thinking we've got a new thought one because we can have the mind of Christ and if we can be used of God so that's our that's the whole problem is our we did have we died out because when I'm dead you know what did Christ may live yeah and I always think about that Lord just make sure I'm dead just kill me I want to be dead why because I can be used of God I just use me the way you'd have me this is from uniting uniting time and sign and brother Brent says What did he say in Malachi 4 would restore restore back the original Pentecostal faith back to the people with the same Pentecostal message the same Pentecostal signed the painting saying Pentecostal evidence the same God the same power the same teaching everything exactly with the vindication of the same pillar fire that struck Paul down on the road down to Damascus among us today doing the same things he did that day uniting we see with the nation's uniting we see the world uniting we see the church is uniting we see the bride uniting uniting with the word why the word is God and has the word as the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the hearer of the word they come together in a union they new unite to using like a wedding see they're becoming they're getting ready for a wedding and they become one the word becomes you and you become the word jesus said at that day you know what all the father is I am and all I am you are and all you are I am in that day you'll know that I'm in the father the father in me ayane you and you and me see at that day one day this day we find out the great hidden mysteries of God being revealed oh how I like that well because it's this day that we become the word that we can see that's what he's made us and we've received an invitation to become to this place but we must receive it I want to skip down here the message identification brother Ram says this is from 1964 message identification and brother Branham says and his character was that he did everything that please God and he stayed with the word that's what he wanted us for too he'd stay we'd stay with God's Word find our place and then know where we where we had staying with his word and think of it we are invited to shape our own character to his now we're going to find out what we've done shape our character to his own by his own spirit then we buy him our sons of God just what I've expressed by having his mind in us to shape our character to his his mind let the mind that was in Christ being you and then he says he continues on says now if you find your place sister don't let me hurt you or brother but you'll find your place in the word as a Christian not what the Creed said that's down here and this lower cannon-fodder that's going to be destroyed you see you find your place as a Christian because your character is molded as Christ and continues on here he says you're invited to come and take his character by having his character in you it mold you into the same mind that he was and his mind was always to do the father had ordained him to do what the father had ordained him to do he said search the scripture they testify of me in other words if I don't do exactly what the scripture said I'm to do then show me where and then I want this is from identification in 1963 brem says and we are invited to shape our own character too he is by His grace we are invited think of it to become characters like he is if we are ready to lay our character down and the molding that we had heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are trying to do right having a form of godliness and denying the power of the word how can God come into a place like that when they deny the word when he watches over his word to vindicate it to make it come to pass and the word is pushed out how can he identify himself with something like that he said we've got to take the entire Full Gospel we must and now being that we have identified ourselves as Full Gospel people let's mold our character we're invited to be molded in His image that we might reflect his presence and the works that I do shall you do also the life that I live so shall you we're invited by God to take him as an example and let our character be molded like he is what a thing my then when we let his character be in us then we have become sons by having the mind of Christ mind which is his character your mind makes your character let the mind Paul said of Christ this mind that was in Christ being you let that mind of Christ being you it molds the character of a son of God so we've been invited and that's what strumming we've been invited to have our character molded like he is but you know the thing is as you've got to accept that invitation that is but he's invited you to have yourself molded just like Kingdom because you know many times we've come to a certain spot but the thing is is have we accepted the invitation to come up higher or to continue on because wherever you stop there's a place you know where is it that you want to go there's an invitation for that well because if there's a if there's a higher place in God or a deeper place in God then there's an invitation that's already been given to us to come to that place and the thing is whatever you have need of their invitation has been given to you to receive that and so for us to become the word to make the word and manifest just as Jesus was the word made manifest that's what he wants us to be and we have been invited to that and this is from the spoken word is original seed he said then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin a virgin of his word and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word in the Virgin who knows no man-made creed or dogmas a word of promise in himself like it was in Mary God Himself made manifest he will act himself by his own word of promise so to fulfill all that had been written of him as he did when he came from the Virgin Moon type of the Spirit womb now so will the Virgin now accept his word be it unto me as thou hast said and says though it was said by an angel yet it was written it was the written word Isaiah 9:6 and continuing on he says notice what harmony Jesus never did anything until he seen the father or the father showed him first harmony between God and Christ see John 5:19 so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again amen then I've got a big hallelujah here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus saith the Lord then it is germanized so the Holy Spirit waters it until it has grown and serves it purpose amen so God has given us an invitation to Coe and be molded into his character and to receive the word that we can become what he is to be the full manifestation of him in this last days and it says nothing can hurt her not even death and the promise is as as he said when the when the bride he said when the bride recognizes who she is she'll be an invincible army he said she'll know what she what he wants done with the word why because that's what the word came to do for us to for him to show us exactly what needs to be done in our day because there's going to be a group that's gonna take a body change you know and that's and it's come to our day this is our day and I think the Lord because I can I can see that this is the day that we're living in when you when you see that all the things that the Scriptures talked about is talked about the end time and this is the day that we live in it's a great day to be living so let's all stand this evening I just thank the Lord for what he's shown us I think we gonna pull that down you know sing your song again I was singing that song earlier I like that song I'll stand for Jesus and let the world go by that's where I want to be with Jesus do what it'll be up here I know the words I'll tell you I'm singing for you I told I told him a little I told brother Joe loss story when we were when that song was out we were kids Richard Richards already go they won't remember this we get to hear it later but we always going down the road that song was on the radio mama was stopping out of intersection if mom dad's watching they'll probably remember this mom was going to hair section was in the car had a station wagon Richard was in the very back of it when the car was loaded full with groceries and that song was playing I was standing for Jesus and let the world go got rear-ended Richard went over the router back right over the back seat and landed in the groceries so every time we hear that song that's what we always think about I'll stand for Jesus and let the world go by Hey [Music] [Applause] and now stand for Jesus [Music] went and did that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'll send for Jesus [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and now stand for Jesus [Music] from there so body [Music] [Applause] but I can't leave me that's why I'm walking with Jesus [Music] together my lord [Music] now stand for Jesus let the world go by now stand for Jesus now claim his promise he will [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now [Music] I know hey man just want to thank you lord [Music] what have I done to deserve such glory revealed to me things for that special when I saw your glory in face to face with eaters [Music] No [Music] and I just want to for letting what have I done to deserve this in the hospital [Music] what have I done to deserve such glory thanks for that [Music] when I saw you yes love come face-to-face with each turn [Music] you didn't have to [Music] [Applause] [Music] 48 hours living it was wretched in a herd recognized in your day sir birdseed and parfaits the breach and the message of grace [Music] what have I done to deserve such glory revealed to me thanks for my despair [Music] when I saw your glorious love come face-to-face [Music] not even in my wildest dreams didn't even see such things as the coming the rapture I have heard but now I see God and simplicity the spoken word is the original seed and Lorna [Music] to deserve such glory revealed to me [Music] special night when I saw your glorious light come face to face Willie turn [Music] let's go go say something come to me brother Wade was reading a reading quote from brother Brown some time back and he was talking about a crystal he said you know you got to tune that crystal just right to receive he said the signals are everywhere be he said that crystal gets tied in and it picks that signal up and there's one thing that struck me when he was saying that when he was singing that song about seeing these things you know the when when you have an electrical circuit so it's like a radio you know when it when it strikes that signal and it hits that crystal you know there's a there's a a physical phenomenon and it's called resonance and I preached the message years ago called the resonance of the word and you know the thing is when you have resonance even in physics for instance you can take a a tube of water and have a tuning fork and I was go ever done done that before you hit that tuning fork and when the tuning fork the waves off the tuning fork are hitting the the water in the tube well when that thing gets filled up to a certain level when you get it just right that tuning fork you can't hear it but when it hits that tube with that water the whole room can hear it and it's just the same with electrical circuit when you get resonance because you've got capacitance inductance and different things that's reflecting and you know that's reason you trying to tune it just to get in but let me tell you something when you hit when you hit resonance and that means that circuit is balanced and it's perfect then you know what you have a perfectly clear signal and the thing is as you know it's when when guys just wasn't God wanting us to reach that that that wave to hit the crystal but he wanted us to know I just sit there receive it but we're supposed to make it manifest so it's just like that that's radio when it when it hits the sound it's not just sitting there holding it it manifested why because it amplifies it one because that's what the circuit is supposed to do when you have something that's when you that's the reason that you're supposed to stay balanced in the word one because God has come to balance us to obey it to put us right where we need to be in the word because that will bring us to biblical scriptural resonance why because when you reach that point then you'll manifest exactly what you have that you've received and the perfect revelation the period to be the vindication of the perfect revelation and you know it's just like when God shows us these things it's not just so for us to have head knowledge it's not just so we know something more than the Baptist's do or the Pentecostals or somebody else know it's us to be make make manifest Jesus Christ and I just want to be just like that so thank the Lord for but you know I just want to thank the Lord for what what I've been able to see and hear you know just like you said he he didn't have to do that but it was his grace to us amen well god bless you tonight as we go we're going as anybody have any announcements or anything Oh minds hearts clear so we'll be December the 28th December the 28th October 28th see oh it's just like just like brother Dale said a long time ago he said I say things wrong so y'all will remember them so the thing is you know everybody should remember what the date was cuz wait done that for y'all's benefit and y'all thought he had it wrong but he was actually he was just trying to make you think that he didn't know what he's talking about but it's actually for y'all's benefit so hey I tried I tried to help you best a good amen well god bless you tonight Lord willing we're gonna be and we're gonna be in North Carolina this weekend we're gonna be a brother team you missed church for
