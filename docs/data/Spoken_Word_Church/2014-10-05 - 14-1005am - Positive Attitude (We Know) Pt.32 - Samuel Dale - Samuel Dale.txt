just commit everything to you in their Journeys and their things back home in Jesus name amen all right we'll go to Psalms 24 and reading from verse 7 down to verse 10 right let's go to verse six I didn't put it up there but this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face oh Jacob seei another words amen lift up your your heads oh ye gates and be you lifted up in ye Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord God the Lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle lift up your heads oh ye gates even lift them up ye Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord of host he is the king of glory amen you may be seated the Lord is at his Blessing if you have it in John go ahead and pull it up brother Anderson because we might read that I gave him one there and then I don't remember where I actually gave it but I want us to think about and to remember this because this is what we're going to be dealing with in John he says we know that whosoever is born of God we know he goes down to verse 19 and we know all right he goes down to verse 20 and we know all right that's I just wasn't reading in Scripture I was just getting the point that we know all right now I like to think and talk about things that we know all right if I get that chair and pull it over here I promise my wife that I wouldn't hobble along and hurt because something happened the other day and uh I went to the chiropractor and they asked me what happened I said I reckon it's me cooking and and washing and doing all the ironing and things for my wife is messed up up my back but it wasn't that it's just something that it clicked and I've got a little burning in the leg and so you pray for me about that but if I pull the CH over here I promised her I wouldn't I got a good place to prop I can do a lot of things but I'm not worried about that I'm concerned about you know being able to speak to you what I know amen all right now Peter said in his talking one day he said I've been on the mountain he said I've been with the Lord Jesus I've seen these things he had spent three and a half years with him during his ministry and things like that but one day he said we have a more sure word of Prophecy all right now as I said I want to talk about we know and this follow me because I don't know which way I'll be going or what I'll be doing in the lineup I told them in the office there to hang on and we'd try to quote some but all right but see Jo I believe it was job that said I know my redeemer liveth amen all right when you're saying I know or we know that word no or k n o w no there I could put it there where the people wouldn't misunderstand me it's a very positive attitude now is that what we've been talking about for the quite quite a while the right mental attitude bringing it to a positive attitude all right and when you say I know now if you say I think that means things can be changed other things can be added etc etc but when you come down to say I know no then it's a very positive statement to be made all right when you say we know these things I like to talk about what I know but I don't mind telling you things that I don't fully know or understand all right because that way uh I can have a uh an open point to it but I want to talk about as I said Peter he said we have a more sure word of Prophecy all right now there's things today that we know and understand that down to time we had a lot of questions about right all right and I believe that was the reason we were talking about it last night the prophet was to be sent to where that we could come to a place place that we would not be uh left you know you remember he came to the to the Jews and then he appeared to the Samaritans you know the high Jew and Gentile but he never came to the Gentiles until the last days into bringing the understanding but in this coming it was not a physical coming of his body to the people but it was a spiritual coming through the revealed word that he promised that he would send us a prophet to bring the word unto us and that's why we believe it that way all right see but then in doing it that way he brought it to us in a very special way uh really I had rather be where we are today in the opening of the word than to have been back there when the Lord Jesus walked on the shores of Galilee all right because if I did then I would be like Peter I would be thinking about what I know or talking about what I know or talking about what I seen or or I was there when the prophet preached this or I was there when the dead was raised I was D when these things all that's well and good but a personal experience is greater than all of those things you could be talking about all right so then in saying that I know that means we we've sat down and we've considered the matter and we know what it is and by saying that you know oh I was trying I remember whether it was last night or not but I guess it was you know if you tell somebody they're wrong you know be ready to prove they're wrong right amen now see everybody say well I believe you're wrong well show me where well I don't know how to show you but I just believe you're wrong well now that's you know that doesn't fit even in the human vocabulary because if you're going to tell me I'm wrong I want you to show me that I'm wrong if not you're just uh trying to impress me or trying to scare hear me are trying to impress people that are around to say well you know brother Dale says so and so but I believe it this way or even for you to say uh you know brother Dale says so and so but I just don't see it that way we say okay now tell me why oh I don't want to cause trouble you just did you opened the can of beans it's done and they're going to spoil if you'd left them in the can it might have been all right but you've opened it up if you're going to tell something then and like I've always said why not come to me first and then we can sit down and discuss things and that way we can know it but people are not going to do that they're going to run their mouth and then they're going to you know like you know how I've always Illustrated it you know that somebody say uh brother Dale brother maybe brother collie you know I'd say brother collie watch brother Mark got against you oh forget it not forget it I shouldn't have brought it up there's no problems you just created one right all right see then that's the way we do I didn't say that well you know but now I've preached quite a while on some different things about the positive attitude and brought down some situations and and tried to cover some things and I want to get this part out of the way and move on because I want my I don't know I may start a series this afternoon on something that is right behind this I really don't know uh Which Way but we'll go over which way the Lord leads but I want to make myself clear on some things and all and then to say to you I know all right then we can cover what we know and then what we don't know I don't mind saying I don't know right I I don't mind that at all because I can be helped all right even after all of the years that I preached on Daniel 70 weeks and bringing it out until it stands until this day as to not being destroyed by anyone there's still some questions in my mind that are not totally clear because I'm a human being I don't mind saying that yeah but you were sure strong enough yeah I'm strong on what I believe what I know I'm glad to tell you all right but what I don't know I'm glad to tell you don't know if was here he life and say the first time he called me he thought he was going to call a guy that knowed everything and he asked me a question and I can't remember now what the question was he can but he asked me a question I said brother Aaron I don't know he said well everybody told me you know everything I said well everybody ain't right because I don't know everything all right but now we've talked a lot about the Plan of Redemption and the way things go in in our journey and so bear with me as I try to struggle between uh thoughts without having to spend so much time because we've already gave a lot of quotes and a lot of thoughts but there is a problem of understanding between you know a lot of things about the Old Testament Saints in relation to the New Testament Saints and you know that that's what I want to cover and we'll talk about it in the bases of what we know all right now we know for certainty that the Old Testament Saints in Paradise did not have eternal life all right we know because Jesus hadn't died right strike it all see why is it I believe so and so I've got a quote where the Prophet said about Elijah sure have I've G it to you before where Elijah said as thy soul liveth and he may talk about eternal life but just remember that those Old Testament Saints they could not go into the presence of God brother B says on questions and answers paragraph 3 you can pull some of these up if you'd like brother brandham said they were in a place like Dreamland Paradise was a place like dreamland it was a place where the people went to now listen here is how technical it gets all the Old Testament people that died didn't go to paradise that's right because you got to remember one thing Paradise was taken up right there's still some people from the Old Testament that will have to come up in the general Resurrection now where they are today I don't know maybe you do I don't know but see they wasn't in Paradise cuz if it' been in Paradise it' come up all right now there's a lot of people there that you got to you know that you don't know where they're at and what they're doing uh I'm not going to put them in hell I'm certainly know not to do that but I don't know where a lot of those people because the Bible says many of the people in brother B emphasized that not all the Old Testament people raised well now where are those people today and what they're doing I don't know there's a lot of things I don't know all right I don't know where the body of Elijah is right right but yet he went up in the Chariot I don't know where the body of Enoch is but yet he walked off the earth I don't know where the body of Moses is and brother Brown said speaking it he said I actually don't think he was buried now that's just because the Bible talks about the the that the devil wants to know where he's buried at brother said frankly I don't think he was buried you know all right but where are those bodies and remember those bodies went somewhere and their soul was somewhere before Jesus Christ come to empty up Paradise amen all right so now you're dealing with some things you don't know but you do know it happened all right everybody follow me you know it happened because the Bible said it happened and the prophet said it happened I can even show you and this in one of the quotes we use today where brother Rand said that Enoch was in Paradise but see I don't I don't understand all of that I have no problems with saying I don't understand but my point is where are they and what happened to them and what happened to them in ation to Jesus Christ because that was before Jesus Christ was crucified that was before the atonement that was before this scripture that we read of open up the Everlasting Gates the king of glory go in that was before so there's some things I don't understand but there are some things I do understand I understand that the Old Testament Saints when they went to Paradise when they died you know some of them the ones that were brother rown called it the Justified that's the words he Ed for the ones that went into Paradise go like I said it could you can't put them all there because if he did you'd empty up Paradise well where's these left so you got a problem all right we know that those Old Testament saints went to paradise and we know that they were not in the presence of God that's right all right but yet the prophet would say they were in his presence cuz there's what we miss what is the presence of God you realize that if we're resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus today we're in the very presence of God I can show you where that paradise was the presence of God that heaven is the presence of God that the souls under the altar is the presence of God that the um bride in the F the sixth Dimension is in the presence of God all right so then what is the presence of God God can be in every Dimension that there is and in the sixth Dimension there has to be many they got to be seven uh whatever you call them spaces whatever because when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time he didn't see Paul and all of those others so each one of those would be in the presence I believe Martin Luther is beyond the curtain of time in the theophany in the presence of God because that's where we miss it by just relating something and we'll read that run around and say they're in the presence of God and then when we do we just anchor that down what is the presence of God all right then in doing it we see that they went into the presence of God in the Paradise but not the presence of God like went to him and took them out don't you think they were in the presence of God in Paradise they were happy they were being taken care of but they were not Eternal all right and you know that Samuel was in paradise and run around covers it that's why the witch of Endor could call him up because the blood of Jesus Christ had not been shed yet and Samuel was in Paradise that's a demon ology E30 demonology that he could be brought out of that and appear to to Saul and tell him you know by the witch of Endor but he said you can't do that now he said because that was not under the blood of Jesus Christ he said but now under the blood of Jesus Christ he said don't you talk about this all that you see and all of these things about you see this and you see that you know he said you get into the wrong thing all right but we know that they were not Eternal in Paradise the Old Testament Saints because Jesus Christ had not died all right now that solves that problem when I say things we say that we know we don't have no problem with it but we know that Jesus Christ died on the cross right amen we know he died on the cross all right and we know that the Bible in reading it without continually following it you'll see that you'll that and even a quote from brother brandom that said when Jesus died on the cross and said he hollered with a loud voice and said to grav opened and many of the Old Testament Saints came forth all right well see it looks like then right while he's doing that but according to Matthew 27 about 53 it said many of the Old Testament saints come out after or in at the time of his resurrection all right now from the time of the loud voice on the cross to Jesus's resurrection is somewhere in the capacity of about three days right not exactly to the point but somewhere close to a three-day Point all right so the graves didn't open according to the scripture until the resurrection of the Lord Jesus go remember first he had to go get him he had to go down to Hell and preach to those people that were lost to be a witness but then he went over to paradise and was to them and brought them out of paradise all right now remember the body of the Old Testament Saints was not in Paradise it was in the grave okay it was in the grave all right now so we know that we're not correcting things we're just putting it in the right perspective brother ROM knew the scripture that they raised at his resurrection so you got about three-day period And I told my wife when I was thinking on this I said what's so wonderful about that you know we talk about the the shout the voice to the Archangel and the trumpet and you know that we talk about being in the time of the voice of the Archangel which is the Bride of Jesus the Jesus Christ and his bride to call fall forth the dead you know that's a progressive Point see it was like 3 days back there wasn't matter how long it is here I thought that's wonderful Lord word that we can think about that that it didn't just it look like that the graves opened immediately with the earthquake but remember there was an earthquake when he died there was an earthquake when he raised right all right now we're in the scripture we know all right so then when those Old Testament saints come forth with him they had to be first brought from Mortal right that's right because they were not Eternal in Soul their soul was their being you can call it their theophany because that's your being that's what you are the person you are all right but see first off then Jesus had to bring them to a place of eternal life in soul and I believe he did I believe when he took those people out of paradise he brought them into an eternal condition in Soul all right cuz that was the first thing but remember their bodies was not there the body was in the grave all right so then when you get to that point then there's where you're going to have problems in thinking about the the things of their bodily raising and that's where the the problem with the understanding of people is that you know and I'm not saying I fully understand it this is the one of those things I'm going to tell you that I'll tell you both sides and then I will say maybe I don't know all right because most to keep it in the right order and to understand we've got to follow it correctly all right but we know the dead raised right right all right we know that they appeared in the city right all right and was seen of many the Bible says it the prophet says it now what kind of a body were they in when they raised they right brother Brandon said they're raised in Immortal bodies okay he says they raised in maybe I don't remember exactly the word corporal but real bodies the bodies of they lived in and he actually says he said job said and just a spoonful of IES left when Jesus brought him out of paradise coming out and brother Brown says remember that job said I know my redeemer liveth and in the last days he said plural I be talking about 2,000 but I believe job raised with the Lord Jesus I believe that but I now I've got the other side of it that job said and I've got the quotes from The Prophet laying here that job said I know my redeemer liveth and in the last days and brother BR said the last 2,000 years job will raise right now you got one statement is saying that he raised back there and one statement it says he'll raise over here I believe it but I can't put it together in a right understanding because to make it a statement this is it careful when you say I know that's what I'm saying today listen very carefully when I tell you what is right I will say I know all right now and I don't mind saying I don't know right all right those Old Testament Saints did they raise in literal bodies we know they're raised in a body enough to be able to be seen we know that but here's a point that we miss we think of the off can't be seen yes sir now I've got the quotes laying here we've given them before so there's no need of it Moses saw the theophany of Jesus you agree that's what your Prophet said you remember it said it looked like the back part of a man right all right so theop can be seen if God desires it to be brought into position what about the man on the road out there that was hit by the car and even the car lunged and even many multiple Witnesses saw the car lunge saw the body go up in the air and they went back and they couldn't find the man see we think about a theophany is not being able to be seen but yet brother brandom will call a theophany a glorified body right an immortal body right those those Saints beyond the curtain of time he was able to see them feel them talk to them hear them must have been pretty real so we know for certainty that when they raised in that theophany they were capable of being seen right all right now we know also a point that's questionable but we know from the future home that brother Bram says there was three raptures in the Old Testament and there was three raptures in the New Testament all right and he said it was a elah Enoch and Jesus that's right of the Old Testament said because he's the Keystone all right he said now one Rapture of the New Testament is taking place which was the Old Testament saints that come up with Jesus now we know for a certainty that there has to be a two-part thought of Jesus and his resurrection amen because he raised in his resurrection and appeared to Mary but he said don't touch me I'm not yet ascended that's right he said but I go he didn't say everybody he said I go to my father and your father all right that's the morning of the Resurrection that evening the Bible says just down below there in the evening he appeared back among them and said feel my hands and my feet Etc all right so we know he went up but we know also that the Old Testament Saints desired to be in Jerusalem and he says I'm going to be make a little Whistle Stop well he did the first one CU he went up and come right back all right but when he came back then the Old Testament Saints could have been around here for 30 40 days you remember that's right they said we got to get out of here because we've been recognized right all right so now I'm laying the whole story out let you think about it cuz there's some things there I don't know I I don't fully understand their resurrection of the Old Testament Saints in comparison to the rest of the scriptures but neither do I and have never made it that they just raised in a theophany I asked a question or whether it was a theophany can we know for certain one thing they did come from Mortal to immortality in Soul that we know all right and when they raised and they were here for a while then they went up see then this scripture comes into view you remember in the book of Acts it doesn't cover in the book of Acts that they went up with him but if they didn't immediately go up with him in the first part and that would have been only just a small amount of time then the Old Testament Saints wouldn't have been able to have pered very long so then you got the Old Testament where Jesus went up in a Rapture but now check the message that he's speaking of he is not speaking of a resurrection in the future home message he said the Old Testament saints went up in Jesus's Rapture all right so he was raptured up and came back then he was raptured up in the book of Acts one all right you remember the angel said why he stand you gazing cuz he went away he'll come back the same way said is what he's going to come back he's going to come back with the Saints you know all right now then in dealing with it we look at it as a point of things that we know but things we we can't make a definite point on because as I was covering about job you can have him raising back there and you can have him raising over here all right like I said about Elijah and Enoch and Moses where did their bodies go I don't know but I do know where the Old Testament saints went all right because they went with Jesus you agree all right so now you see the point in between that there are some problems that I don't understand I don't mind admitting it did they raise strictly in theop bodies there or did they raise in literal bodies I don't know I know that Elijah and Enoch and Moses they went somewhere but it doesn't cover where they went but it does cover where the Old Testament saints went that I know so then we can follow it from a point of I know because see when he came back then he appeared for 30 40 days right and then he went up all right so then the Old Testament Saints would have had to went up at that raising because that is not the first Rapture of Jesus which would be of the Old Testament to be the Keystone but it would be the first of the new to make the Keystone between the old and the new to be correct then he could take up those Old Testament Saints all right now I will say it this way I do not believe and have taught it that those Old Testament Saints raised in human bodies that were made Eternal in the resurrection maybe you do that's up to you the reason I don't believe it is I made it plain why is because the Bible says that no man hath approach to immortality but Jesus Christ all right but I love the rest of that scripture but it says life and immortality is brought to light through the gospel right amen all right I believe one day we'll understand a lot of things because it's brought to light all right but taken to immortality you know mortal bodies immortality means mortal bodies made Eternal all right mortal means death doomed human bodies all right we'll get to that that later on in the in the message part this afternoon all right now see then as those Old Testament Saints raised they raised in and brother around calls it a bodily form he calls it a glorified body he calls it an immortal body but you know one time he said that even a sinner had an immortal body right run you quote see now you got to know that he's not talking about a sinner in Eternal so he's referring to what a person a human being is in the image of God it no matter whether he's lost or saved and his soul is in the very image of his maker even our bodies are made in that image part that he's doing but I'm just giving you the point is like I said we know that Enoch went up but brother R said his soul was in Paradise well he doesn't say that Elijah was there he doesn't say that Moses was there that I can find now I said that I can find well I'm not worried about it I'm saying some things I don't understand I'm not worried about but I'm concerned about what I do understand when brother brandham went beyond a curtain of time he ask about Jesus now these quotes are laying here if you need them he said can I see him he said no said he's a little higher amen you can't go there that's right all right now did the Old Testament Saints go into the the presence of Jesus in that form that he was higher than brother brandom if they did you got a lot of problems then you got problems with the Hebrews 11:40 that they without us cannot be made perfect all right see then you got trouble trying to get it together because you can't say no you can only say I'm saying what was said all right I can say repent every one of you get baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost is that scripture Matthew 28 come on I can say repent everyone to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ right I've quoted both scriptures all right only through this end time Prophet was we able to understand how that those things comes together to make it Lord Jesus Christ because now I'm going to say something that's going to be hard for you to swallow but there's no scripture that says the baptized quote a scripture quote in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he doesn't say that he says in the name of Jesus Christ but then Paul picks it up later in the writings and he said in the name of the Lord right so now to fulfill the Great Commission that's why when I baptize that's what I say to fulfill the commission repent everyone and be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost to fulfill that I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ uh we had some people come to church here and it's is the only people I've ever told anything and they said well I was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ do you think that was correct I said the Bible says Jesus Christ and that would be correct as long as your understanding is correct but if you were in a church that baptized under regeneration see some of the churches do Pentecostal churches baptize under re generation in the name of Jesus Christ now listen some of them baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but it's under regeneration just like the Church of Christ the Pentecostals baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ expect you to come up speaking in tongues all right what are you bringing that out for brother just to show that the prophet brought it Lord Jesus Christ Christ and that's the reason I baptized the way I do cuz I found one day how he said it to fulfill that Great Commission you know all right and those people I told them they said do you think I ought to be baptized again I said I think anybody that would be baptized under regeneration right whether it would be Church of Christ or where it would be Pentecostalism or whatever or to get baptized again amen because you're dealing under regeneration and we don't baptize under regeneration that's not scriptural see that I do know all right you see what I'm talking about there things we do know that has been put together for us in this end time by the end time prophet and that's why we can State the things we State and say I know all right see then if they without us cannot be made perfect all right and I have the quotes where brother brandom I will maybe give it this afternoon but where he even says that know they're waiting on you and I to get lined up that's see for us to get straight right he talking about the Old Testament Saints all right that's right but see that way you're looking at it with the right understanding and just saying we leave some things alone but we do know for sure right all right now as I said I don't believe that they were raised to immortality In the Flesh in the Old Testament science you know that's okay if you want to believe the other way that's fine that's because you know you got a quotes you got but just remember the same Prophet that said they raised in an immortal body are raised in the body they lived in are raised into this that or the other the same prophet said it one day Adam will reach over and get Eve Eve will get able able to get Seth Etc right down to Abraham he said right he said there'll be a resurrection then he comes to the Future home and he says one of these days Those Old Testament Saints he said we raise in the resurrection he said and we'll fall right in line and go right on amen that's right so is he confused no I say we are I say we are all right you can say but I believe it this way well the other person said I believe it this way now what are you going to do you're going to argue with each other until the Doomsday and all you doing is marching around horrib do will not say I don't understand but I do understand one thing they raised and one day we raise I do understand that I know that because I know where they went and then you can decide whether which way they went there so when it says open up the Everlasting Gates that the kingom glory may go in now brother randam gave those quotes and when he did let me see if I can just find one right off where we can move on with it all right got the Old Testament guys we got all of them that he's a little higher okay go over brother Joe to number 12 W of and uh we'll try to make some few statements and then we'll come in a little bit upon the thought and then wait until that's afternoon to conclude some things so look what he says in the message the mighty conqueror said the Old Testament Saints being led by the Lord Jesus the mighty conqueror the Old Testament Saint when they got close to that great Celestial City they said lift up you Everlasting Gates and be you lifted up and let the king of glory go in and they said who is the king of glory the Old Testament Saints Mighty and the see the the Lord of hosts Mighty in battle he led captivity captive he ascended on high and gave gifts to men walked up into the presence of God the father and he said here they are father I have overcome and I've brought them here all right now watch him he said climb upon on this throne and set down at my right hand till I make every enemy your foot stol so now we know for a certainty where they went they went into the presence of God yeah all right but see you can Elevate that away on up but why not leave it where it's at where're in the Bible we're in the Bible is it that he is to climb up on the throne and sit down and we'll cover this this afternoon remember when Jesus the reason he said climb up on the throne and sit down that's the father's strong which would be the baptism of the Holy Ghost down through seven Church ages that's why he said climb up the throne because Jesus said he did overcome shall sit with me in my Throne as I have overcome and sit with the father in his throne now Jesus had to go straight to the father's Throne to show it was finished he climbed upon the father's throne and sat down but one day he'll come forth from there to his own Throne all right see his throne is on Earth Millennium all right but now he's sitting on the throne and where's the body at the right hand right where's the body the body's at the right hand where's the right hand where you going into scripture with it CU you go into scripture with it to where Jesus went that the people went with him all right so now let's just read it turn on Revelation chap 5 let's go to four and then we'll go to Five remember now the key is and there's a lot of quotes to this I'll give them this evening he said climb upon my Throne upon the throne and sit down that was not his throne that was the father's Throne which would make the baptism of the Holy ho ghost to be able to come back so those other Old Testament saints went where he went where did he go where's the next account of him after the resurrection right so we look in Revelations 4 and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven now brother brandham defines and explains this and then he explains one sitting on the throne he actually says that John first didn't see one sitting on the throne he saw the throne the domain the kingdom the things he said then he saw one sitting on the throne now remember that's not his throne right because something's got to happen and he that set up was to look upon like Jasper and S and stone and there was a rainbow round about The Throne inside of an like unto an emerald right which is the Lord Jesus Christ sitting on the throne in heaven the body to this day is sitting on the throne in heaven that's why his body is not here on Earth right we know that CU we're his body right see when all of this is finished it'll match up then he can come that's right all right now if you go to souls in prison you'll find brother Brown saying he said that lamb was back in eternity making intercession he said he come around to the one sitting on the throne climbed upon on the throne and said I am and said I'm the one that done it right that he becomes the one on the throne that's right all right now watch and it describes what he looks like but look around the throne and we know where he went he went to the father's Throne right right I said I've got a lot of quotes laying here many more at home but a lot can be read that he went to the father's Throne so where did Jesus go when he resurrected he went to the Father Strong we think he went up to some position somewhere or something on Beyond where's the scripture and where's the prophet CU even the prophet said Jesus is higher but said you can't go there right right all right show me in the message are the scriptures where he went you say into the presence of God I'll be glad to read these quotes to you because that's what he says about him raising and going and going to the father's Throne into the presence of God these things we know all right but look who's there and round about The Throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats I saw four and 20 Elders clothed in white rment what is that now that's that's eternity right okay clothed in white rment and they had on their heads crowns of gold already had them all right now brother randam who are those 24 Elders he said the 12 apostles and the 12 Patriarchs you're in chapter 4 in chapter 4 you have the 12 apostles and the 12 Patriarchs so where did the Old Testament Patriarchs go with Jesus to the same place he went come on but it's chapter 4 a total reality or are those in a theophonic Eternal form going roll up chapter 5 in luk all right and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on backside seal with Seven Seals and a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who's worthy to open the book and loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven now you can I quote brother randam from the seal book he said if I get the wording wrong now you put it in right he names some of the Old Testament Saints see seem like he names Abraham seemed like he named Elijah he named some of them and he said they were th but he said they wouldn't worthy right that's right now if they were already in glorified soul and the a body why wouldn't they have been worthy so there's got to be a key cuz he said they're not worthy if they had reached to Total immortality why were they not worthy and then they wouldn't be waiting on us we'd be dependent upon what they done we remember 24 Elders you remember at that time John wasn't there you know what I'm saying but the 12 apostles John was one of the 12 right but at that time he was seeing all of this so it had to be a Future Part you know or had to be an eternal theoy Point go look what it said and I saw a strong Angel proclaim a loud voice who's worthy to open the book and loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look their own and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their own and one of the elders saith unto me we've not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and the ls the seal and I have be held and low in the midst of the throne where' the lamb come from brother brandom says the lamb comes from the church ages now if you want the quotes cuz that's Father Strong now come on if you can't tie this together then you're going to miss the whole thing who is that lamb and what is that somewhere up in heaven or was that the son of man that was promised to come in this last days not brother brandom separate that now not brother brandom the son of man the Lamb of God the Lord Jesus Christ was promised to come in this end time all except what a Corporal body right is that the words of the prophet he said he's here in every way except the Corporal body right why wouldn't we believe in healings and signs and wonders and believe Hebrews 13:8 and why wouldn't we believe sir that God is here with us doing it but I just don't see it you remember all them messages I just don't see it why are we sick right maybe maybe it's never went through the dumb part of her head amen he can't heal you if you ain't sick right do I need to quit right there if you ain't sick you don't need a Healer if you ain't lost you don't need a savior so we've got to let it go down to the bottom right cuz we're not dealing with just healing of the flesh that's right chapter 5 is not dealing with the human flesh that it's dealing with the opening of the word the things we do know that God didn't leave The Mercy Seat in 63 the body is still there even till this day when he raises to come here Redemption will be over but remember we meet him in the air what do you understand what he's saying he came and took the book out of the right hand hand that sat upon the throne around and says solds in prison look he said he climbed up on the throne sat down he said he been back in eternity make an intercession he become the one on the throne but who all was still there when he was doing this and when he had taken the book The Four Beast come back beast and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vows full of oders which are the prayers of the Saints the 24 Elders in chapter 5 right the 24 Elders is the 12 apostles and 12 Patriarchs now I'm going to say it this way and you can just think what you want to we know for certain that those 12 Apostles do we need to name them 12 Apostles you know Peter James John those 12 Apostles are not in glorified bodies their body is in the earth that's right they've got to come here to get their body sir why can't you think about the Old Testament Saints having to come here to get their body right right now you're trying to interpret it brother Dale no I just lit a point in let you think about it I've told you there's some things I don't know I do know the rest of what's there it's in the same quote that we just read but we won't cover that till this afternoon because see here's the thing that would be hard to be understood if they went to immortality back there then why did Paul say death is not destroyed that's right that's all I'm saying on it to we get back this evening cuz I was going to really I wasn't going to go through this I was just going to go on but I seen I can't go that way without covering this point we're going to talk about death being annihilated what is death oh go down to Undertaker you I've been on that for how many years that ain't death yes sir that's right where's the greatest battle ever fought right here where's real death dwelling at what is the death that God has come to annihilate the carnality of man's mind but see if they've already went there to eternities and all kind of things then they're not waiting on us we're dependent on whether or not they were accepted but I hope you caught the point of what I said the 12 Patriarchs the 12 apostles the 12 apostles are bodies in the grave and they got to come forth to get their bodies all right you said well what are you doing correcting this or that no just being plain right to where you can think it over and to see then they without us cannot be made perfect I know what was explained by Brother away from here and he explained that the Old Testament Saints was waiting on Jesus to make them perfect New Testament Saints was waiting on you and I to make us perfect well I can't read that in Hebrews 11 because everyone I read in Hebrews 11 was Old Testament science see we want to get a point and then we make it and just say we lay on this but brother Dale the Old Testament saints went right into his presence amen yes sir because we just showed where Jesus went and if that ain't the presence of God you got the father's Throne you got the son sitting on the throne you got the rainbow around about The Throne if that ain't the presence of God I don't know where you want to go to that's right but now here's what I love for a second see all of that you can argue F and bicker but think about it right here is the Father Strong that's right which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul that's right yes sir right and right here is where the son of man is going to become and has come and already the seals has been broke the things that happened and by that message you and I can become the son of man we're not trying to take a book or trying to do this out of the other that's not our place and even like when brother Brown would say he said he climbed up on the throne and said down do you realize that us being trinitarians in the way we was and not understanding the truth that Jesus was not on the throne of our life I don't care what you say right he might have been there as a savior right he might have remitted our sins and saved us right but he was not there as God of our life it takes this message to bring him to God of Our Lives that's right it takes this message to bring us to eternal life that's right what is the Old Testament waiting on what is the the all of the people of the world like I said the other day everybody going that way and everybody was backed that way is waiting on you and I that's right you know that them 144,000 they're dependent on you and I getting out of here and they they'll have the message to take to Israel but if we don't get out of here they won't have no message you know the F Ste Jew is dependent on you and I and what is it that we how that we would make them perfect you remember we make them complete we finished their course for them this fell right here has got to be made Eternal then is swallowed up that's right right is that what Paul said when mortal has put on immortality then is brought to light the scripture death where you sting grave where you Victory right waiting on you and I to conquer death that's why it's been 40 something years folks and we've been fighting and cricking and bigger yeah but all that time I haven't lost a goal because my goal to begin with was what 1969 I know people don't like me to say that because they say you're exalted there's one thing about it I it happened right brother dick's been up there that iold after what you call it Tower whatever you call it that old thing walk all the way up in there I ain't never been big fortun in you ain't never been right well he's been well for him to get up and say I've been I like everybody throwing off on brother per green they threw off on to say he's exalted he's been to 140 something countries you know what if he's only been to 139 he lied right but if he's been 140 he ain't lying and he ain't bragging but see we think oh he's just brother Dale's trying to brag no I'm telling the God's Hest truth when I first came in this message when I seen what that Prophet said I didn't turn to trying to figure out a book of rules and thing I turned to see what a revelation of Jesus Christ the very God of Glory to be revealed he to you and I and to see him and what he's done you think about what we talking about it last night you think about what he's done for you and me he took us you think about David you don't never relate like that he said David said I took you from a sheep fold in other words out there what use that word a plain little old bitty guy that was nothing all he know how to do was play a harp I never did understand that out it there with the goats and things the Sheep but he could do it and he could sing and worship taking care of a few sheep God said he said I made you king that's right and he said even in all of your doings he said I forgive you right you just think about where we come from old farmer that was dragging out of living PL a mu when I 7 years old took us to where at least we've got good jobs good homes comfortable places to live comfortable Church to set in not the best in the world but we could have it if we just depend on getting one thing and do it but we don't do that do we we try to help others a little but look what he's done for us amen took us out of the garbage cans that's right and made us his children right sir Hallelujah made us his offspring yes sir amen and saying I'm saving the best the last that's right because everything else is waiting on you and I that's right think on these things but then we're going to talk about death being destroyed you know because if it's not destroyed you said it was destroyed in Jesus Christ amen but show me one person after then that's my point show me one person after Jesus Christ that death was destroyed in it took every person since then so it's not been applied to us yet May Illustrated it there where he said the Jews were saved at Calvary you remember that you need to just quote brother R said those Jews were saved at Calvary he said but it's not been applied he was eternal but it's not been applied to nobody but it will be applied in the end time let's stand it will be applied to a a ride that will be able to stand and say I and my father are one amen and I know I know where I stand but then I'll tell you some of the things I don't know I have no problem with saying that but a finished Plan of Redemption is labeled or dependent upon you and I right you say yeah but but I just don't see nothing going on you mean the greatest thing that the world has ever thought about is going on and you don't see nothing going on right the end of all things has come upon us and he's dependent on you and I you remember what we brought out messages before then he's waiting on you and I that brings a Plan of Redemption to a completed form right here in you and I now listen to the last statement then Jesus went through death burial Resurrection and Rapture right see nobody's ever done that right but this bride in the end time is going to have to go because some are in the grave some are going to go through death burial and then there'll be a resurrection and then there'll be a Rapture identically matching what he done and nowhere is there anybody else that matches it amen come on the 144,000 don't match it that way you feel seal you don't match it identically matching the Lord Jesus Christ is where you and I will come to right well I don't know whether it nerves or unbelief right well I believe it's for brother Dale oh my now brother brandham said if there's one going out of Georgia you got to say it's you not brother Dale because if you say it's brother Dale you better move States then right that's right you got to say it's you and see then I say it's me think about it what do we got number 94 94 number 94 anybody have a need heard in the you have heard fear I'm just talking about Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever just trying to say I know but then things I don't know they can be made known when we get and you know I'm not worried about it us the importance is what we are and what we're doing we're going have to walk right up to death look at in the eye life you sing you will glor yesterday you that have had migraines you know you think about her pray for her believe is always well in the name of Jesus Christ we send this pray CL for all to be finished CU we believe you in Jesus is your name anybody else the refused to loveon be see when we get there we can talk about what went on here but I remember what I preached to you for what 20 years I guess if Revelations 5 is a place a position we've got a match here on Earth exactly what that is when Martin Luther reached a place of justification glor he left the because that was for the day and John Wesley seen it and preached it and they lived it he went on off when you Pentecost sing their day had to go on somebody is not going to go on we're going to go up why can't we believe we're the on an you say brother there how many people do you know believe much you believe I ain't never been worried about it but I've been one thing and you know it I'm always looking for somebody that believe what I believe you know what when I find them I TI on to it because that's the way I am I believe around the world that God is working in a bride to bring her to a place may just be one or two here one or two there but he's still doing it somebody to recognize who they are and what they're here for you realize you're here to conquer the devil so that everybody prior to you can come out of the Grave or come to whatever is needed so we have a great position to be reached yeah but if we was a bride we'd see more like I said we've seen six or so times of dead rais and you can say that to people on the internet and they ain't a one of the people out there going to come and run in here to say but if you'd have done that 20 30 years ago You' you we' have had to have three times a building to put them in we'd have been meeting up in Gainsville and that great big old 3000 capacity thing cuz everybody would have run to it to see the Ted's been raised now you can say what you want to now you can preach the way you want to oh that's just anointed ones thank you at least you say that I'm anointed you understand I mean if you saying I'm anointed and that happen at least you're saying I'm anointed thank you what's the matter with you oh that's you don't like what's your problem well I'm just sitting here waiting on the lord well all right just make sure that you're at the train station instead of the bus depot that's right right you understand father we thank you we love you and we've tried our best to be as plain as we could to bring forth what we know the things that we see in your word and to follow thereafter we know so now just take that part that we know and make it into a reality a manifestation into our hearts and lives forgive our sins and cleanse us and guide us in Jesus name amen your dismiss pray one for another father Al
