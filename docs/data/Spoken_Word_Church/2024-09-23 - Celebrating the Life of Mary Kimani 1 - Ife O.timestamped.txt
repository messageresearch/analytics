[1:06:39] Mary means bravery and devotion and
[1:06:44] beloved what a wonderful uh smile I told

[1:06:50] that that smile can be ever be
[1:06:52] duplicated by a human being on this side
[1:06:55] that's right she just had a smile that
[1:06:57] would just take you in and Captivate you
[1:07:00] and and you had to listen to
[1:07:03] her somebody say amen amen you had to
[1:07:06] listen to her you just had to she made
[1:07:08] sure you
[1:07:09] did amen she was just she was just that
[1:07:12] way right he was just that way listen
[1:07:15] the good
[1:07:16] things we sit here to talk about the bad
[1:07:18] things we like I said we're all in
[1:07:20] trouble right but the good things in
[1:07:22] life is what we want to remember her by
[1:07:25] amen amen I do
[1:07:28] not
[1:07:31] think that the devil had anything to do
[1:07:33] with this I think it was God Amen God
[1:07:36] Only Takes a life Satan never takes a
[1:07:39] life he has to give permission if he
[1:07:41] even wants to mess with
[1:07:42] you come on somebody that's right okay
[1:07:46] so this is this is what God decided to
[1:07:47] do and and I know if you've heard me
[1:07:50] enough preaching you know one thing for
[1:07:51] sure I tell you every service God don't
[1:07:54] make a mistake
[1:07:55] he can't make a mistake there's no way
[1:07:57] he can make a mistake every move he
[1:08:00] makes is
[1:08:01] perfect we just look at it sometimes in
[1:08:04] the in the time element that we're in
[1:08:06] brother Tony we look at it and go yes oh
[1:08:09] I don't know if I do that or not you
[1:08:10] know what you're not God Amen that's
[1:08:13] true God's mind's way above ours his
[1:08:15] thoughts are way above ours the way I
[1:08:17] look at it is is that that if if you're
[1:08:21] settled with God now listen if you're
[1:08:23] settled with God if you if you're born
[1:08:25] again Christian if you settled with
[1:08:27] God then we should be rejoicing as the
[1:08:31] Bible says the Bible tells us to Rejoice
[1:08:33] at the death of a saint and to cry when
[1:08:35] a baby's born we got that totally
[1:08:37] opposite now we go to the we go to the
[1:08:39] hospital and we just oh these beautiful
[1:08:41] baby that baby's born and if God don't
[1:08:44] do something that baby's born to
[1:08:46] die and without a conversion on this
[1:08:49] side that baby's going to just go to a
[1:08:51] place that we're not even going to talk
[1:08:52] about cuz I'll promise you folks you
[1:08:55] believe or not you people sitting here
[1:08:57] there's a
[1:08:58] hell and there's a devil and there's a
[1:09:01] judgment and you will go to one or the
[1:09:04] other there's not a gray area there's
[1:09:06] not somewhere you can just float along
[1:09:07] and do what you want to do no noise God
[1:09:11] sent his son to die to bring you eternal
[1:09:15] life that's right amen and an afterlife
[1:09:19] it's not a hope brother Austin it's not
[1:09:21] a hope I don't that word hope gets you
[1:09:23] to Faith right but we got to have faith
[1:09:27] I'm not hoping I'm going to
[1:09:29] make no I'm not going to hope I'm going
[1:09:31] to say it for assurity amen that if
[1:09:34] you're born again today you're going to
[1:09:35] make it because God told us he sent his
[1:09:38] only son to die for you to give you
[1:09:39] eternal life amen and Sister Mary it was
[1:09:42] just a privilege for us to to um immers
[1:09:45] her in in in water baptism and the only
[1:09:47] way to baptize in the name of the Lord
[1:09:49] Jesus Christ amen father's not a name
[1:09:51] son's not a name Jesus told us to do
[1:09:53] that he told us to baptize the name of
[1:09:54] the father something but father is not a
[1:09:57] name Peter on the day of Pentecost said
[1:09:59] exactly what Jesus said he said repent
[1:10:02] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:10:04] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:10:05] sin she took that we put her in the
[1:10:07] water and she went to a watery grave and
[1:10:09] came back up a new person amen oh yeah

[1:10:14] issues but you know there was a woman
[1:10:16] one
[1:10:17] time I'll be quick there was a woman one
[1:10:21] time
[1:10:23] that she was having a bad time in life
[1:10:27] life she had been probably kicked out by
[1:10:29] her
[1:10:30] family she was not doing very
[1:10:33] well she'd been kicked out on the street
[1:10:36] maybe maybe unloved and she took on a
[1:10:40] job that was very
[1:10:43] lowly she heard one time where Jesus was
[1:10:46] going to
[1:10:49] be she heard one time where Jesus was
[1:10:52] going to
[1:10:52] be and she didn't run any other
[1:10:54] direction
[1:10:57] she prepared and went to Simon's
[1:11:02] houseen that's where Jesus
[1:11:05] was something drew her even in the sin
[1:11:08] that she was in the all the things she
[1:11:10] had done in her life she wanted to see
[1:11:13] Jesus she didn't want to just see Jesus
[1:11:15] she wanted to wash his feet that's
[1:11:18] right and uh and the uh and her name was
[1:11:22] Mary by the way if you don't know that
[1:11:24] okay prise
[1:11:26] amen but she walks in and all the high
[1:11:28] and mighty they're
[1:11:29] like if he's a prophet he should know
[1:11:31] who this woman is she's
[1:11:34] unclean she's in
[1:11:37] sin right right it didn't stop her
[1:11:41] though she had a little box of
[1:11:45] O and back then they didn't have screw
[1:11:48] tops and plastic no it was
[1:11:51] Clay and when they put the ointment in
[1:11:54] they sealed it
[1:11:56] the only way to get it out was to break
[1:11:57] the
[1:11:58] Box come on that was the only way they
[1:12:01] was no screw Caps or squirt bottle back
[1:12:03] then sorry about that it was in a pot
[1:12:06] and that pot was sealed with
[1:12:08] ointment and she goes to Jesus and she
[1:12:10] doesn't say a
[1:12:12] word Jesus starts doing what she in her
[1:12:16] heart amen thought to
[1:12:18] do she said if I just want to wash this
[1:12:22] man's feet there's something about him
[1:12:24] that's different yes and poor old Simon
[1:12:27] he's over there in the corner and he's
[1:12:28] looking at her and he's looking at Jesus
[1:12:30] and what did Jesus do he turned and
[1:12:32] looked he said Simon he didn't say I
[1:12:34] have somewhat against her no he said I
[1:12:38] have somewhat against
[1:12:41] you you're sitting over there grumbling
[1:12:43] about this woman washing my feet and you
[1:12:45] didn't wash my feet you supposed to be

[1:38:55] that thought I had a different crowd
[1:38:57] here God don't make a mistake never
[1:38:58] change his
[1:39:01] mind he birthed her when he was supposed
[1:39:03] to and he took her home when he was
[1:39:05] supposed to we don't question God job he
[1:39:09] questioned himself more than he
[1:39:12] questioned anything else he was
[1:39:14] questioning himself on that but he knew
[1:39:16] though when he stood one day and
[1:39:18] something struck his heart sister
[1:39:21] Alicia he said I know my redeemer living
[1:39:24] amen I know I didn't think I didn't hope
[1:39:28] I didn't get it from the neighbor I
[1:39:30] didn't even get it from the
[1:39:32] preacher it was a personal relationship
[1:39:35] that he had with God he said I know my
[1:39:37] redeemer live amen and in the last days
[1:39:40] what will I do I'll stand right here and
[1:39:43] I'll declare his glory every day it
[1:39:45] doesn't matter if God takes us all home
[1:39:48] we're still going to stand right here
[1:39:49] and declare his glory until we get on
[1:39:51] the other side and then

[1:40:38] throw away our ideas amen Christians has
[1:40:41] one idea and that's God's
[1:40:44] idea what the scripture says to bind
[1:40:46] closer together not separate bind closer
[1:40:49] together when these things happen but if
[1:40:51] you don't if there's a crack you know
[1:40:53] who's going to fit that crack the
[1:40:55] devil's always going to fit that crack
[1:40:57] but if you'll Shin it up bind it up
