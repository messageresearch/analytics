[6:26] problem okay there's a lot out today
[6:29] like traveling so remember each one pray
[6:32] that the lord I believe brother Bob's
[6:34] down in Atlanta or some work he's
[6:36] preaching for somebody but we never
[6:38] didn't know who but just remember those
[6:43] remember the fret the Lord would bless
[6:45] and be with Wade this afternoon and we
[6:48] try to continue on our thoughts and
[6:50] doing of you know the word of the Lord
[6:52] okay
[6:53] father we thank you for a great day in a
[6:55] great time that we've had to be able to
[6:59] worship you and cherish you and to know
[7:02] how to worship you in truth and in
[7:05] spirit Lord because that's where that we
[7:08] need it to be and the only way we can
[7:10] follow that then is to follow thy word
[7:12] and watch the word unfold to each and
[7:16] every one of us and Lord just bless each
[7:17] one bless those ur to be traveling back
[7:20] and different things Lord and just have
[7:22] your way with all of us and you forgive
[7:25] our sins and cleanse us Lord and guide
[7:28] us with your grace and love we committed
[7:30] to you now in Jesus name Amen
[7:34] Jonah - as we've been talking about
[7:38] salvation
[7:40] alright so Jonah says what but I will
[7:46] sacrifice unto thee speaking from the
[7:50] whales belly see the animals belly the
[7:52] we would argue whether it was a whale or
[7:55] the fish who's worried about it he was
[7:57] in the belly of something down in the
[7:59] bottom of the ocean and he wanted to be
[8:01] set free so he said I will sacrifice
[8:03] unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving
[8:05] I will pay that I have vowed salvation
[8:10] is of the Lord now what about as quick
[8:16] as he said salvation of the Lord look
[8:21] what happens and the Lord spake unto the
[8:23] fish the after he said salvation is of
[8:28] the Lord the Lord spoken to the fish and
[8:33] it vomited out Jonah upon the dry ground
[8:36] growling okay let's go to revelations
[8:40] because if we can get to this point in
[8:42] our thoughts
[8:43] revelations 21 we'll begin in verse 22
[8:48] to just save time of reading this is the
[8:51] future home the description etc all
[8:54] right a marvelous thing
[8:56] here's their one sin as we get to this
[8:59] now remember this is the future home
[9:01] that's it this is the eighth day this is
[9:04] the thing this is the city described
[9:06] this is an eternity all right look and I
[9:10] saw no temple there in for the Lord God
[9:14] Almighty and the lamb are the temple of
[9:16] it and the city had no need of the Sun
[9:19] neither of the moon to shine in it
[9:22] didn't say it would be shining this is
[9:24] you know I don't need of it for the
[9:25] glory of God did lighten it and the lamb
[9:28] is the light thereof see behind us a
[9:31] kind of glory they didn't have to have
[9:33] no lights they didn't hell no no candles
[9:36] behind it was out in the outside all
[9:38] right what and the nations of them which
[9:41] are saved the nations of them which are
[9:45] delivered the nations of them who
[9:48] received the nation's now you can talk
[9:52] about the bride right and the nations of
[9:57] them which are saved shall walk in the
[9:59] light of the and once and the kings of
[10:02] the earth do bring their glory and honor
[10:05] into it you said well ain't no Kingdom
[10:08] remember Russia has a head
[10:11] it's not called Kings like was
[10:13] explaining last night see we think it's
[10:16] got to be well this night in role in the
[10:18] nation's it had was England they were
[10:20] the only one had a king so they're the
[10:21] only one going to be here Oh glory
[10:23] you're smart
[10:24] think about it sensibly it's just
[10:27] expressing the nations of the earth and
[10:32] their rulers right are going to be their
[10:37] clothes all right now and the nations of
[10:39] them which are saved shall walk in the
[10:40] light of it and the kings of the earth
[10:42] do bring their glory and honor into it
[10:45] and the gates of it shall not be said oh
[10:48] shut at all by day for thou shall
[10:53] be no night there Ian and they shall
[10:55] bring the glory and honor of the
[10:58] nation's into it now remember how
[11:02] brother Branham explained they're going
[11:04] to bring their glory and honor in they
[11:07] go back out
[11:10] well the bride can eat the fruit in the
[11:13] city the nations don't get the fruit
[11:16] they get the leaves off the tree to show
[11:21] no more war when they come in give their
[11:25] honor and glory they go out they take
[11:27] the leaves as a sign but the fruit is
[11:31] for the bride okay they shall bring the
[11:34] glory and honor of the nation's into it
[11:36] and there shall be shell in no wise
[11:39] enter into it any thing that defileth
[11:41] neither whatsoever worketh abomination
[11:43] or maketh a lie but they which are
[11:47] written in the Lamb's Book of Life you
[11:50] may be seated
[11:51] all right then who's going to be in the
[11:54] city the bride of Jesus Christ all right
[12:00] we'll get over to those things
[12:02] eventually we were trying to bring a
[12:05] thought to you to be able to follow
[12:09] things in the correct order because see
[12:12] we read that and we said well when we
[12:16] get over here there's going to be
[12:20] nations that says there's going to be
[12:24] kings there's going to be people here
[12:27] and this is the future home you don't
[12:32] think about where do they come from and
[12:33] what do they do what do you think we
[12:35] need to understand it do you need to
[12:37] understand that acts 2:38 don't contrary
[12:40] to the rest of the Word of God Matthew
[12:43] 28 now it's not contrary to acts 2:38
[12:46] right do we need to know that and then
[12:50] we have another favorite one is we'll
[12:52] get to it in a little while in the
[12:54] thoughts of the nations and how they're
[12:57] judged we'll say it like this brother
[13:01] Branham changed that later well I won't
[13:05] know where he changed to that see that's
[13:08] your philosophies and your thoughts that
[13:11] fit within and I'm sorry I'm just blunt
[13:13] like that I'm sorry for being that away
[13:16] but I'm not sorry for the word I say
[13:20] maybe the terms in youth
[13:22] about it because I believe the truth all
[13:25] right now what are we talking about
[13:27] salvation the word salvation means
[13:30] deliverance all right so there was a
[13:32] salvation in the Old Testament there was
[13:35] a deliverance you you you can use the
[13:38] word term and deliverances crossing the
[13:40] Red Sea or coming up out of the earth
[13:41] and they were delivered or Israel was
[13:44] delivered out of Egypt as a salvation
[13:47] all right but they was a salvation to
[13:51] people in the Old Testament all right a
[13:56] salvation means to dealing with you as
[13:59] to a future event
[14:01] our thoughts are doing the time that
[14:05] you're there and what you are in
[14:07] salvation those people back there there
[14:10] was a salvation and to prove that the
[14:12] salvation was genuine
[14:14] then the Old Testament people had a
[14:17] place to go to when they passed away
[14:20] that is the proof of whether or not your
[14:22] salvation is worth anything
[14:25] all right see in the New Testament then
[14:27] we read here all the way to the future
[14:30] home and that deliverance of salvation
[14:33] takes us all the way there not just the
[14:37] fact that it takes us and we die and go
[14:40] by the grave and we go as sold under the
[14:43] altar and and those things and have a
[14:45] place to go to that we have a place to
[14:48] finish it all up which is the future
[14:51] home the proof of it is what we just
[14:55] read then there that they'll be the
[14:58] kings of the earth or anger glory and
[15:00] honor end all right but we read to that
[15:04] there's got to be a people who will be
[15:07] in the city that their names were
[15:10] written then it specifies that in the
[15:14] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[15:16] foundation of the world all right so
[15:18] then there's a future thing to it to her
[15:21] that we're were we're at to that place
[15:26] all right now explaining then our
[15:31] thoughts we picked up in the life
[15:34] message and talking about this past
[15:38] Wednesday talking about a God of
[15:42] compassion all right and we talked about
[15:48] it being that away as the Prophet
[15:50] explained it from sirs we would see
[15:53] Jesus that there's a difference between
[15:56] well so he goes on to be not afraid and
[15:59] he goes you know other things but I
[16:02] didn't bring them but if you want them
[16:03] what is compassion there's a difference
[16:07] between compassion and sympathy all
[16:12] right Jesus walked into the pool are
[16:14] healed one person and walked out why did
[16:19] not sympathy make him heal them all it
[16:24] would have hurt if he just had sympathy
[16:26] but he had compassion all right now what
[16:31] was our thoughts about it how did
[16:32] brother Branham explain it
[16:34] compassion is to do the will of God
[16:40] sympathy would require that he save
[16:44] everybody and do everything and to keep
[16:47] him from being a respecter of persons
[16:49] he would have to bring that to PI's that
[16:52] would be sympathy but God is not a God
[16:55] of sympathy you said well you don't
[16:57] think he sympathizes with with people he
[17:02] don't sympathize with anybody that turns
[17:04] him down remember word rejecters where
[17:10] do they go word rejecters go to hell
[17:13] well is he gonna be standing I wish you
[17:15] wouldn't go I wish you would know that
[17:17] sympathy but when you come to compassion
[17:23] it means to do the will of God and God's
[17:27] will is his word so if we turn down the
[17:32] word we're automatically rejected that's
[17:35] no problem because that's where it's
[17:37] made but remember now compassion
[17:43] the said he went in and he healed that
[17:45] one person he came back out all right
[17:49] now
[17:50] the scripture says what I do nothing
[17:58] until the father I see the father you
[18:00] know doing it on test James 5:19 all
[18:05] right see he knew and could walk in
[18:09] there and heal one person then and come
[18:12] walking out and that be the will of God
[18:17] right that was the will of God fulfilled
[18:21] right there walking in and walking out
[18:23] and healing one person see that we talk
[18:26] about sympathy because the word
[18:28] compassion if you look it up in Webster
[18:31] you're gonna get an interrelated point
[18:34] of sympathy and compassion right because
[18:39] it's going to give you a human
[18:40] definition but in Bible terminologies
[18:44] compassion is for God to keep his word
[18:51] right
[18:52] there's compassion the best definition
[18:55] you can get out of all of it that's for
[18:57] him to keep his word and see then he
[19:02] doesn't have to you can't argue with him
[19:05] about things so he goes by you keeping
[19:08] his word but we get our human thoughts
[19:14] as we were talking about last night the
[19:18] Bible says that he raised up Pharaoh to
[19:24] prove his honor is everything right did
[19:29] he give a favor or change
[19:33] did he give him a change if he didn't
[19:38] give him a chance he's not God well
[19:42] where did he give Pharaoh change when
[19:44] Moses first went down there Moses walked
[19:48] in there and said let my people go
[19:52] he had a chance right then to turn and
[19:56] let them go
[19:57] but he made his choice
[20:00] by saying I'm not gonna do that then you
[20:03] say well but the Bible said he hardened
[20:05] his heart he couldn't harden his heart
[20:06] to start with once he made his point I'm
[20:10] not going to let him go there was no
[20:13] problem then God could harden his heart
[20:15] yeah but remember now in each account
[20:18] listen reading Bible Moses would go into
[20:22] it and he'd say let us go out so far and
[20:24] come back you know after a while Pharaoh
[20:26] agreed with him after a couple of
[20:29] plagues right Pharaoh got to agree with
[20:33] him he said just go out there so far and
[20:36] do this and this do that and come back
[20:40] but the Bible said God hardened his
[20:43] heart what did he do he simply said to
[20:47] Pharaoh Pharaoh if you let them go
[20:48] they're gonna keep on going he hardened
[20:53] his heart but that's what I'm getting at
[20:55] see we think we know what we're talking
[20:57] about we think we understand God in his
[21:02] ways but what about a compassionate God
[21:06] that will never break his word he won't
[21:09] break his word to do something he's
[21:13] exactly with his word what I'm saying
[21:15] then if you take Pharaoh you read the
[21:18] Bible
[21:18] well the Bible said did he raise Pharaoh
[21:21] up for that reason well you got it we
[21:25] got the scripture but if he didn't give
[21:31] him a change we said well Jacob have I
[21:34] loved and he saw have I hated you think
[21:36] he didn't know before there's born
[21:38] whatever gonna do so what to do you know
[21:44] II saw what he done is what God saw in
[21:47] his mind before the world right see we
[21:50] think we get it all figured out
[21:53] because we can read a scripture or a
[21:56] quote from the Prophet instead of
[21:58] listening to the thought and thinking
[22:03] about the answer and what it would be
[22:08] remember you're talking about a God
[22:11] that cannot break his word well God can
[22:17] do what he wants to he can do what he
[22:18] wants to but he can't break his own word
[22:20] cause he broke his own word he wouldn't
[22:22] be God is that plain enough well I know
[22:26] wait a minute he he said he raised this
[22:28] up and done this that and the other go
[22:33] back and check how you raised him up
[22:34] you'll find exactly what I'm talking
[22:37] about
[22:37] he walked into Pharaoh and he said
[22:39] Pharaoh let my people go
[22:41] Pharaoh's would've made the choice God
[22:44] never made him act like that you
[22:48] remember what we were talking about
[22:50] Wednesday night that this baby's our
[22:54] baby's born mean you remember that from
[22:59] Winston the babies are not born mean
[23:04] they're born with a sweet humble spirit
[23:08] about they learned to be mean by the
[23:15] ones who raised them cold where do they
[23:18] learn from you remember that
[23:23] let's see Pharaoh he raised up a little
[23:26] baby just like everybody else but he
[23:30] went after those things and that's what
[23:32] caused his nature we'll get back to that
[23:34] in a minute but what we were talking
[23:36] about but you understand
[23:39] we covered Wednesday night talking about
[23:43] the thing that is confusing to our
[23:48] thoughts in our minds how that God would
[23:54] raise up a heathen heathen I put our on
[23:58] there you know a seat I put the ER in
[24:01] just like I say woman you know you
[24:06] remember that I've always said woman he
[24:09] spell it with an R he spelled heathen
[24:12] with an R that southern Dale language he
[24:15] then is overcorrected life not he's
[24:17] supposed to say heathen not he learned a
[24:20] lot the heathen he
[24:23] he gets I'll call him an unbeliever
[24:26] that's a better word huh what about
[24:31] a people who will wind up in the
[24:38] Millennium to hear the gospel now listen
[24:45] what I'm saying
[24:46] none of us could read the Bible and find
[24:49] that it took a prophet that the word
[24:57] could come to to tell you what the Bible
[24:59] says
[25:00] yeah but the Bible says the Bible says
[25:10] but bringing it down to human language
[25:14] we interpreted is the wrong thing trying
[25:18] to get that point across wins because I
[25:19] want you to make sure to understand one
[25:21] thing to understand why your prophet and
[25:28] we gave the scriptures studying it out
[25:30] Wednesday that the fact that they would
[25:33] be a heathen in the Millennium to hear
[25:38] the gospel that God would raise up but
[25:43] see we as I said we can't read those
[25:45] things we can't even hardly read Romans
[25:50] when he's talking about the the Jews and
[25:53] they're doing and wind up with a field
[25:55] field you that will be given eternal
[25:59] life even though they rejected Jesus
[26:01] Christ that they were blinded of God to
[26:09] worse Gentiles could come in but yet we
[26:12] try to figure all about this that the
[26:14] other block oh this happened on the
[26:16] Bible just says they were blind we see
[26:18] we know nothing about those things
[26:20] my point is to try to get us to a place
[26:23] to think about this message and what a
[26:26] great understanding it is to think about
[26:30] that God would actually save that filthy
[26:33] old Jew
[26:37] come on Ricci seals fulfills you is that
[26:42] Israel from the time of Calvary down to
[26:47] where we are you know whatever is your
[26:50] prophet would cover it is the those Jews
[26:53] that were blinded so you and I could be
[26:56] saved isn't that a wonderful that's the
[27:01] most marvelous thought so grace you
[27:04] don't think like that you don't think
[27:06] that God would would blind his own
[27:08] people and then turn around and give him
[27:11] eternal life that's a marvelous now
[27:15] listen
[27:16] that's a God of compassion now listen
[27:19] that's not a God of sympathy sympathy
[27:23] would require did he save everybody
[27:27] compassion would be to do the will of
[27:29] God and God's Word you say words it said
[27:33] it romans tells you of Israel that was
[27:39] blinded that we could be brought in it's
[27:42] in the Bible just as we were reading and
[27:46] talking about that heathen that would be
[27:51] given an opportunity to come to the
[27:54] Millennium and it would have to be
[27:55] raised up and brought down and give it
[27:59] an opportunity to hear the gospel some
[28:05] marvelous understanding and grace
[28:07] remember you're saved by grace through
[28:10] faith now remember to just as it is with
[28:14] that it fills you God can't break his
[28:16] word so he told in Romans he told
[28:24] through the Prophet that what you
[28:27] remember we read at Wednesday that those
[28:31] people because of being good and kind
[28:38] people under their own laws in times
[28:44] would wind up to go to the Millennium
[28:49] and given a chance to hear the gospel
[28:54] you don't think like that how marvelous
[28:57] that is no you're only thinking about
[28:59] your own salvation into doing that's
[29:01] your only thinking you're glad that God
[29:03] is keeping you from dying going down
[29:04] you're not serving God out of a love
[29:06] you're serving God because you're glad
[29:08] that he didn't letting you go to hell
[29:09] for your knowing that we judged we need
[29:12] it it's supposed to be ours but that was
[29:16] what I'm trying to bring out Lyndsey of
[29:17] the Prophet in the way that he was
[29:19] explaining grace that that people would
[29:26] actually be given a chance to hear the
[29:30] gospel in the Millennium oh but brother
[29:35] Dale I don't grow cilantro he says I
[29:38] ain't gonna be nobody in the Millennium
[29:39] but with the bride and a few Jews it's
[29:42] gonna be pretty well crowded go we got a
[29:45] bride it's gonna be there we got 144,000
[29:48] it's gonna be that we got Israel as a
[29:50] nation it's gonna be there I'm quoting
[29:53] brother Branham now we've come up with a
[29:59] unbelieving people heathen now as we
[30:04] were discussing last night and we said
[30:05] we'd get back to that what do you think
[30:07] about is a heathen
[30:12] well that's the aborigine over in in
[30:15] worth australia some Aborigine jungle
[30:20] guy back in there or we think it's some
[30:25] african tribe what do you think about
[30:30] that would make a heathen
[30:38] see we try to make it as to something
[30:40] that we think about it as then being
[30:43] some kind of an uneducated but the
[30:45] idiots that know nothing if your profit
[30:49] would brag on him and say he said daily
[30:54] are better by their tribal laws than we
[30:58] do by everything else said before they
[31:01] can even marry said they've got to have
[31:04] a virginity test and if the girl is not
[31:08] still a virgin she has to tell who and
[31:10] they kill both of them logs that make us
[31:15] Christian nation oh we're a Christian
[31:20] nation Christian what what did brother
[31:26] Brennan put on the end of that when were
[31:27] you talking about that if they had to
[31:29] take the virginity he said I hate to
[31:31] have to do it here is that true
[31:35] and they remember one time
[31:38] now listen really did try he said I'd
[31:41] hate I'll find it I kissed her phrase
[31:44] mister club he said I'd hate to think of
[31:48] how many virgins you'd get out of a
[31:50] choir oh then we could go to church in
[31:58] the choir and pick out I didn't write
[32:03] the book sorry for finding it why do you
[32:07] get upset with me for finding what the
[32:09] Prophet says or the Bible says you're
[32:13] gonna find out when these days where
[32:14] that all comes from where it's going to
[32:19] because it we're still trying to find
[32:21] one thing a way to get us out of here
[32:25] alright brother branham on the message
[32:28] you go ahead and pull up number six if
[32:31] you want to word in case somebody comes
[32:33] along and don't don't know it will give
[32:37] you number six then we'll come back to
[32:38] five and four and pick it up well what
[32:41] is brother Branham say on the message on
[32:43] the handwriting on the wall that he's
[32:46] talking about these heathen
[32:50] that we think are just nothing that's
[32:54] just him people back in them jungles
[33:01] we're going to get around to it in just
[33:03] a minute we're gonna find out what about
[33:05] the people sitting today in churches
[33:11] hearing what they think is the Bible but
[33:16] it's not the Word of God does God look
[33:21] at one he's indifferent yeah we'll give
[33:26] you the definition further than a minute
[33:28] so but listen have you ever thought
[33:30] about what about a people listen to the
[33:33] Prophet this is taken from the message
[33:36] the handwriting on the wall 1958 in the
[33:39] book of Acts the 10th chapter and the
[33:40] 35th verse they probably said I perceive
[33:42] that God is no respect of nation or
[33:45] person but will accept such as will
[33:49] serve Him in righteousness watching no
[33:53] matter what church you belong to God
[33:55] expects you to respect to him and he
[33:57] wants you to serve Him in righteousness
[34:01] now watch him the I'm saying this is
[34:07] common sense but they should have made
[34:09] another paragraph Astarte because they
[34:11] changed their thought when you change
[34:12] your thought in English you're supposed
[34:14] to make another paragraph but look they
[34:16] did he wants to serve you to serve Him
[34:19] look if we fail to take them the gospel
[34:26] then God will judge them according to
[34:31] the knowledge that they had and how
[34:37] respectable they were to it Oh bless His
[34:41] name
[34:46] what are we still like as I said and I
[34:49] don't mean it in this raga Tori but just
[34:50] that's the way that was said see we old
[34:53] Baptist we said ain't nobody going to
[34:55] heaven and ain't done less a bard again
[34:58] but then we find out if there's a a
[35:01] foolish version that can be that we
[35:03] finding out
[35:04] a lot of people going to be that they've
[35:07] always had fed with we think maybe the
[35:09] millennium just gonna be high for dozen
[35:11] people running around like the brother
[35:13] said life's not about it when you gather
[35:15] all them people together and you put
[35:16] infinity and you just keep going with
[35:18] infinity and infinity it might take a
[35:20] lot of infinities to be able to hold all
[35:22] the people you know what I mean
[35:26] might take a whole lot of world I don't
[35:31] care what you're talking about I'm
[35:32] talking about if we don't take them the
[35:35] gospel we're gonna have to give an
[35:39] account if we don't take them the gospel
[35:45] God has a way of doing it he'll judge
[35:48] them people by their own laws and the
[35:51] way they live well what was that how to
[35:55] do salvation it has a lot to do with
[36:02] salvation when we read from Romans you
[36:08] remember what we read down from Romans
[36:10] how that the people will beat let's get
[36:15] that scripture go ahead get Romans order
[36:18] that Romans 2 Romans 2 let's get it and
[36:27] just read it
[36:28] Romans 2 yeah now listen for when the
[36:35] Gentiles what is a heathen even what is
[36:39] it even a Gentile it just simply means
[36:46] nations the word doesn't signify people
[36:50] it signifies nations all nations are
[36:56] Gentiles well because God was dealing
[37:01] with one nation called Israel and
[37:05] everything else was Gentiles so look and
[37:09] when the Gentiles which have not the law
[37:13] do by nature
[37:18] the things contained in the law in other
[37:24] words if they live a good life by their
[37:26] own nature what's what it says having
[37:36] not the law or a law unto themselves
[37:42] which show the work of the law written
[37:45] in their hearts in other words they're
[37:49] living the law to the letter and know
[37:52] nothing about it because it's the nature
[37:58] their conscience also bearing witness
[38:01] and their thoughts the mean while
[38:03] accusing or excusing one another we
[38:11] think oh it's got to be through this
[38:13] it's got to be through that I'm telling
[38:15] you I've tried to tell you we're still
[38:17] in the Old Testament we got to the New
[38:19] Testament here with the blood of Jesus
[38:21] Christ I'm talking about a salvation in
[38:24] the Old Testament if our salvation in
[38:27] the Old Testament listen is not correct
[38:29] and in perfect line up how can you
[38:32] expect the New Testament to be worth
[38:34] anything if he couldn't keep his word no
[38:37] test we can't keep it in the new yeah
[38:39] but Jesus come to do yeah
[38:45] remember Jesus come to not to destroy
[38:49] the law but to magnify the law right the
[38:54] law said thou shalt not steal Jesus said
[38:56] if you think about the law says thou
[38:58] shalt not commit adultery jesus said if
[39:00] you think about it he magnified it you
[39:04] see I want you to go back I wish you'd
[39:06] go back now and listen to Wednesday
[39:09] night services well they're good well
[39:14] read you Playboy magazine and get on
[39:16] your Facebook's and run all of these
[39:18] other doings and just do all of that
[39:20] and don't let do what you're asked to do
[39:22] I simply ask you every once in a while
[39:25] to simply listen to a message well I was
[39:29] dying hurting what'd you hear see that
[39:35] that unbeliever all right will be judged
[39:41] not by God's Word not by the ten
[39:45] commandments not by those things
[39:47] he'll be judged by what according to
[39:50] your prophet the law he lived under of
[39:54] his own people now what a wonderful God
[40:00] that is you don't think about that how
[40:04] gracious he is that those people will be
[40:10] able to hear the gospel and be in the
[40:16] Millennium now if you're gonna be in the
[40:17] Millennium just remember if they're
[40:23] raised up in the Millennium is of trying
[40:25] to say a little bit life's not about do
[40:26] you think God's gonna turn around it at
[40:28] the end of the millennium and judge him
[40:30] and throw him into hell after he's done
[40:32] raised him from the day it and brought
[40:35] him up to hear a gospel you realize that
[40:38] person that's intimately and your
[40:40] prophet we're gonna read where he said
[40:42] it would be in the Millennium will he
[40:46] change that later okay show me war
[40:49] planes show me work well I don't believe
[40:53] that Cody's changed it later show me
[40:54] where showed me where he ever changed at
[40:58] all see we don't want to believe it for
[41:05] some unknown reason you mean I've got to
[41:10] do this and I've got to do that I've got
[41:12] to do this and I've got to do that and
[41:14] that unbeliever can just walk right up
[41:18] in there and go right on the end of the
[41:19] millennium and be thank God because I
[41:24] ain't got to do
[41:26] you ain't got to do we do it because of
[41:30] the love that we have in our heart for
[41:33] him if you live a Christian life because
[41:35] you're trying to get out of going to
[41:36] hell you're in bad shape if you live in
[41:40] it according to as I said about the the
[41:42] Gentiles they do by nature what does it
[41:47] mean they do by nature the nature of a
[41:53] baby is to be good
[41:55] it's trained to be wrong babies not born
[41:59] mean but they become mean because of
[42:05] what's around them the environment that
[42:07] the devil's domain that we come into as
[42:14] I've always said - you know - poor
[42:15] little baby it's born laying in a
[42:17] hospital bed
[42:18] and the first thing it remembers is
[42:20] hearing them nurses cussing and raising
[42:22] Cain about how many babies was born that
[42:24] night
[42:26] the poor little fella ain't got to
[42:28] change right and see you remember what
[42:34] we were talking about Wednesday night
[42:35] the way we raise our children is the way
[42:42] they will be well I raised my children
[42:47] right I tried but a failure that's the
[42:52] best way to say I raised him to try to
[42:55] be honest when a bank man come along one
[42:59] day and he said fella that was running
[43:01] the bank he said whatever you and your
[43:03] wife done said you've done a good job
[43:05] raising three kids well I felt good
[43:07] about that because of a man of that
[43:09] caliber or authority to be talking about
[43:12] the fact that our children were good
[43:13] children we tried to raise our children
[43:16] to be good but still how much did they
[43:19] see of us you know where did they learn
[43:24] some of their things from as I said what
[43:27] do you talk you look at the baby
[43:28] you look at a little kid and he's
[43:30] walking it was was it yesterday or this
[43:34] morning there so and this guy was
[43:36] walking on the side the road and his
[43:37] woman and he's walking like this with
[43:40] his feet spread out
[43:41] and I just died laughing because here
[43:43] come a little boy about ten years old
[43:45] he's walking just like Daddy that's
[43:50] right they learned from you and me okay
[43:56] if you want to listen to the message I
[43:58] try to preach the best I can in love to
[44:00] understand but I don't preach it with no
[44:04] CC five-point I try to make it plain our
[44:08] children we raise them to be what we
[44:12] want them to be what about that little
[44:21] African he's earned that knows nothing
[44:28] no he knows everything just like that a
[44:31] baby's born here in America because he's
[44:34] watching somebody and following somebody
[44:38] and some of them wind up with a real
[44:40] good nature because they're gonna be
[44:43] there the nature the others who wind up
[44:46] with the wrong nature is going to be
[44:48] unbelievers that are cast into hell I'm
[44:52] not saying that they're all going just
[44:54] recoated in your the gospel that is not
[44:56] the way bread around didn't explain it
[44:58] that way and the Bible don't explain he
[45:00] explained it as being the nature and
[45:03] that's what the Bible explained it as
[45:04] being the nature that child has a nature
[45:07] that is indwelt within it from its birth
[45:10] coming up Adolf Hitler was no different
[45:13] than any other child Judas Iscariot was
[45:19] no different than any other child they
[45:25] finally went after their own thinking
[45:27] because of their ways and what was
[45:29] around them and and everything else
[45:31] motivated them you studied a little bit
[45:34] about Hitler you know Hitler he wasn't
[45:36] he was pretty bad
[45:37] we think he was bad but you know what he
[45:39] tried everything in the world to get the
[45:40] office till he finally got an office
[45:43] just take a little bit about him he'd
[45:46] done anything he would get in office he
[45:48] finally got an office he wrote this and
[45:50] he wrote that he was in prison he was
[45:56] the church whether we believe it or not
[46:00] we have trained our children to be what
[46:04] we want them to be no I raise mine to be
[46:08] a Christian well then did we act like
[46:10] Christians in front of them plain honest
[46:14] answers now what do we do come on that's
[46:21] all I'm trying to get to like Wednesday
[46:23] night is how that God would look at that
[46:27] people that we look at is unsavable on
[46:32] all things they know nothing about the
[46:35] true God of the Bible
[46:37] what is a heathen what is an unbeliever
[46:43] wage was given the terminologies for it
[46:46] like not what it's a group of people
[46:48] that do not believe in the true God
[46:58] this is good of definition this could be
[47:01] anymore
[47:02] an unbeliever is one who do does not
[47:05] believe in a true God do you realize
[47:08] then whether you like it or not and
[47:10] you're gonna face it God I'm gonna
[47:12] explain it the best I can
[47:13] we've got foolish virgins we've got
[47:16] people that's going to be given eternal
[47:17] life that's what I'm trying to explain
[47:20] is there's people going to be given
[47:23] eternal life I'm trying to explain how
[47:28] and you get upset with me cause I'm
[47:30] saying you know right now everything in
[47:33] the world is an unbeliever except the
[47:36] born-again believer who has believed in
[47:39] this message to the point that it is the
[47:44] message of Almighty God everything else
[47:46] is unbelievers now let's get a little
[47:52] closer what about all the doctrines that
[47:55] are in this message that are playing
[47:59] unbelievers come on we're gonna get it
[48:04] one of these days we'll be right the
[48:06] Bible says fear not little
[48:08] what did your prophet say I doubt a
[48:12] dozen out of this generation need me
[48:16] talking about whether you're saved or
[48:17] not right he's talking about a change of
[48:20] the body get it right he's talking about
[48:22] something coming to a change what is
[48:27] causing you and me that we've had all
[48:30] these years why would we come to a
[48:32] change sitting in her in the woods
[48:38] rather they thinking about it I said
[48:39] thank you Lord you realize that when
[48:46] Adam and Eve sinned they sinned by
[48:53] protection of the tree of knowledge
[48:54] right do you realize the whole world has
[49:03] been under that condemnation from that
[49:07] day till now and listen do you realize
[49:11] even you and me that are born-again
[49:14] believers come on up we're still eating
[49:20] of the tree of knowledge no no no we're
[49:25] not we got the word now well not you got
[49:28] two souls you got two lords you got
[49:30] peruses you got everything in the word
[49:32] as you claim what do you believe you
[49:35] realize if it's not the one true and
[49:37] living God and believing it correctly
[49:39] we're still unbelievers now you want the
[49:43] scripture what did it say to Adam and
[49:46] Eve which was saying it to ever person
[49:49] that would ever be born the day you eat
[49:55] thereof that day you die the reason you
[49:59] and I are doing it you know what we're
[50:00] doing we're dying every day if you don't
[50:03] believe it honey get in front of a
[50:05] mirror just for a second and take a look
[50:08] you're dying
[50:10] why because we're still eating of the
[50:15] tree of knowledge
[50:19] you can call it the Word of God you can
[50:22] call it the message of the hour but if
[50:24] it's not true and exactly lined up in
[50:27] the Word of God like in the Old
[50:29] Testament God was dealing with one
[50:31] nation is that right Israel was the only
[50:37] nation that had the understanding of God
[50:40] and the whole world was unbelievers but
[50:45] Israel and you had some float in because
[50:49] you had the Moabites that come from
[50:51] Abraham you had this group that come
[50:53] from Abraham so then you had an example
[50:55] back there just like you've got examples
[50:57] now you've got foolish virgins right
[51:02] there are not born again right that's
[51:08] why they're foolish virgins but they're
[51:11] believers and Evon confessors until one
[51:14] day they will be given eternal life
[51:17] because of their confession are you with
[51:20] me
[51:21] so is the Moabites it mad in with the
[51:24] Israelites
[51:25] so is this group that they came in and
[51:28] what was the word proselytes is that the
[51:29] word for maybe come in and they had to
[51:33] do this at the other you remember if
[51:35] they came in they had to be circumcised
[51:37] they had to do this why because the God
[51:39] was dealing with one nation called
[51:42] Israel because Israel was the only
[51:46] nation in the world that had the
[51:48] understanding of God the true
[51:51] understanding that's why they were
[51:54] chosen abraham believed God and it was
[51:57] imputed unto him for righteousness you
[52:03] realize what I'm talking about all the
[52:07] whole world was unbelievers but their
[52:10] leaders realized they come on all Jews
[52:12] or not Jews all original eyes not
[52:14] Israelite we know the story with you
[52:16] talking about it last night Abraham he
[52:19] wouldn't Jew he was a Gentile he was a
[52:22] Hebrew you know what the word Hebrew
[52:24] means Hebrew doesn't mean as a nation or
[52:27] a point Hebrew was the point of what it
[52:29] said I brought your father Abraham
[52:31] from the other side of the river the
[52:33] Bible says that the big river from the
[52:35] other side the flood right where the guy
[52:41] looks one danger comes Abraham arose
[52:43] Abram then he's walking the cross and
[52:46] the guy looks at him he said what's your
[52:48] name he's my name is Abram oh you're
[52:50] Hebrew you just crossed the water that's
[52:53] how he got his name that's how he wound
[52:58] up with Abraham being the Hebrew
[53:02] see there was no true lineage but you
[53:07] didn't come in until somewhere over in
[53:09] the Kings and the Jew only signified two
[53:12] tribes one of them was Judah the other
[53:15] one I can't remember the one that went
[53:16] with it but remember it that's time the
[53:18] ten times is over here and bondage and
[53:21] he's ten two tribes was over here and
[53:23] they were called Jews why did not God
[53:28] come from the tribe of Levi the
[53:34] Levitical priesthood you don't never
[53:36] think like that why didn't Jesus Christ
[53:39] physically now we know we don't have no
[53:41] lineage so don't run wild with it good
[53:45] if you run the lineage of Jesus you know
[53:48] where it's gonna stop that it's gonna
[53:52] stop in Joseph it ain't gonna stop in
[53:55] Mary it don't get to marry it stops in
[53:59] Joseph Joseph wasn't the daddy of Jesus
[54:03] that's why you can't run natural
[54:06] vintages but to Judah the reason he's a
[54:10] Jew it's not that if actively being
[54:14] Judah or been Jew it means chosen
[54:18] Jimmy's chosen or God's own the Bible
[54:24] says I don't Judah shall come a lawgiver
[54:32] that's why Jesus had to come from the
[54:35] lineage in line of Judah not down
[54:37] through David I don't die not only needs
[54:41] you can do it it's a spiritual lineage
[54:44] it's not a physical lineage it's what
[54:48] heats me alive about these people in the
[54:50] message oh if I was a seed what seed
[54:53] you're talking about the only seed I
[54:55] want to be related to is the seed of
[54:57] Jesus Christ the one that was promised
[55:00] in Genesis that I'll put my seed I'll
[55:08] put the covenant between I'll make a
[55:11] difference in your seed in the seed of
[55:14] the serpent I'll give you the seed of
[55:19] the woman which is a promise of Jesus
[55:21] Christ's coming
[55:23] see that's what I'm trying to get see
[55:25] you think about well how in the world
[55:27] would God say this people that's a you
[55:29] don't even understand what he's talking
[55:30] about those people never heard they
[55:38] never heard the truth people in the Old
[55:40] Testament all the way through they never
[55:43] heard the truth the nation's as far as a
[55:46] nation I didn't you're the truth they
[55:49] were he through they were unbelievers
[55:52] Israel was the only believers and Israel
[55:56] coming from Abraham Abraham was a Hebrew
[56:02] because he comes with ya the Bible said
[56:04] I brought your father Abraham on the
[56:06] other side the flood what Abraham never
[56:11] come physically from the other side the
[56:13] flood it's a spiritual seed that was
[56:16] promised I put enmity between thy seed
[56:18] and the seed of the woman
[56:21] there's your spiritual seed I don't care
[56:24] about physical seeds it's spiritual seed
[56:29] Jesus comes from the tribe of Judah not
[56:32] from the Levites why didn't he come from
[56:34] the Levite Levitical priesthood isn't he
[56:37] not the priest is he not the high priest
[56:39] is he not all of those things we never
[56:41] come from that why because he come from
[56:44] Judah because the Bible said God of
[56:48] compassion has to keep his word the
[56:50] Bible said he couldn't come from Levi he
[56:53] had to come through Judah because that
[56:57] would make him dinner Jew God's chosen
[57:01] see we're not as realized at all in but
[57:04] all Jews are Jews all true Israelites
[57:09] are true Israelites of the God of
[57:13] Jehovah when they'd Israel go wrong is
[57:17] when they turn down that one standing
[57:19] there that said before Abraham was I am
[57:22] under God that was back there and you
[57:25] worship me are you gonna be like the
[57:27] rest of the heathen
[57:29] you're gonna be like the rest of the
[57:31] unbelievers so what is it today
[57:35] when Martin is wave come that life not
[57:37] when Martin Luther was bringing the
[57:39] truth it doesn't matter if he's
[57:41] Trinitarian or whatever it was he
[57:42] brought the truth of the day that put
[57:45] him in the body of Christ gave him a
[57:46] born-again experience but didn't it kept
[57:48] moving down until the Prophet come to
[57:50] bring us the word in wait spoke was
[57:53] something our today he'll get back on it
[57:56] because see it's in the Word of God
[57:59] God's going to keep his word he said in
[58:04] Romans are he said them people will be
[58:10] there because they have a nature about
[58:14] him a good nature that he loved what did
[58:19] what did God say he said your your your
[58:23] offerings has become a stink in my
[58:25] nostrils is that true you know what he
[58:27] said he said I look to a man that is
[58:31] honest and a contrite heart he wouldn't
[58:35] look at no more at offerings when guys
[58:38] over tower offering offerings and he
[58:40] says boy bless God I'm glad I'm done it
[58:42] I'm glad I've offered this offer and
[58:44] it's making me right and here's an old
[58:46] unbeliever back out in the boonies it's
[58:49] just living a good life and God looks at
[58:52] him and it says you'll be the looks at
[58:55] that Jew that so lined up in his
[58:57] lineages so lined up in his do's and
[58:59] dont's until he winds up and God cast
[59:03] him away
[59:07] cause according to your nature I thought
[59:12] we believed the nature of your soul was
[59:13] God if he's born again come on listen do
[59:24] you realize then that in that millennium
[59:29] those people let's go back to that one
[59:31] number six oh no excuse me number four
[59:35] let's go back to number four I'm just
[59:39] jumping back and forth on this is all
[59:41] girl you listen to Wednesday night
[59:42] because that was the message where it
[59:45] was broke if you listen to it the
[59:48] messages are the things that I say it is
[59:50] dark as you can see what we're talking
[59:54] about you can see why that unbeliever
[59:57] can be in the Millennium but yet a true
[1:00:00] staunch old
[1:00:01] Jew rabbi you know less God I'm on my
[1:00:05] way to have him Carter kept the law and
[1:00:08] Paul said it's not those who glory in
[1:00:10] that
[1:00:11] he said it's according to their nature
[1:00:14] that old fire seeds stand up there and
[1:00:17] could quote you the Bible and claim his
[1:00:19] lineages and show everything and turn
[1:00:23] around and kill the Gentile just because
[1:00:25] he wouldn't believe her he didn't care
[1:00:32] you don't care about killing anything I
[1:00:36] like the way brother Branham talks when
[1:00:40] Moses figured out what he's doing you
[1:00:41] know already killed Egyptian you know
[1:00:43] what brother Ron said he said of all the
[1:00:46] training that Moses gotten his life to
[1:00:48] be the delivered Israel said he wound up
[1:00:50] with a stinking dead Egyptian now I like
[1:00:53] that you may not like that you might
[1:00:56] think it's derogatory I don't it's just
[1:00:58] a simple point of showing that Moses
[1:01:04] believed it and was willing to kill for
[1:01:07] his belief all right let's go back to
[1:01:11] number four and pick up this that
[1:01:13] there's going to be people in the
[1:01:14] Millenium trying to bring it out
[1:01:18] licensed that Wednesday night questions
[1:01:20] and that's
[1:01:21] which is number four in Jeffersonville
[1:01:27] you talking about the seed and never
[1:01:29] they need to return of the church and
[1:01:31] the bride the bride in Christ shall walk
[1:01:34] out upon their ashes in the Millennium
[1:01:36] that's the ones that are not right
[1:01:39] that's the people who have the wrong
[1:01:41] nature now put it that way
[1:01:44] now put it that that's the people who
[1:01:46] become unbelievers and things because
[1:01:49] that they take their own nature and they
[1:01:51] learned to be eel and mean and arrogant
[1:01:54] and hateful and kill each other
[1:01:56] they're unbelievers right with what
[1:02:01] about the believer and run of the church
[1:02:03] and the bride the rotting Christ shall
[1:02:05] walk out upon their ashes in the
[1:02:07] Millennium when the earth is purified by
[1:02:09] fire then they shall reign and the
[1:02:11] heathens that's never heard the gospel
[1:02:15] she'll be raised in that time and the
[1:02:18] sons of God will be manifested now
[1:02:23] listen if there is no other writing in
[1:02:26] the Bible you say well what are you
[1:02:30] gonna get that out where are you going
[1:02:34] to get a gospel and who's going to bring
[1:02:41] it and it can be to a people in the
[1:02:45] Millennium Scripture I read it when we
[1:02:52] first started revelations right let's
[1:02:58] read it again revelation did you listen
[1:03:01] did you follow the reading go ahead pull
[1:03:04] up the revelations let's get that one oh
[1:03:06] I got a hurry revelations 21 and said in
[1:03:12] the cities there's no need and all for
[1:03:14] the glory of the Lord shall delight in
[1:03:15] the city and the nations of them which
[1:03:17] are saved that's what it says in
[1:03:22] Revelation the nation of them that are
[1:03:24] saved shall walk in the light of it and
[1:03:26] the kings of the earth do bring their
[1:03:28] glory and honor into it and the gates of
[1:03:31] the city shall not be shut all the day
[1:03:33] and I
[1:03:34] there shall be no not there and they
[1:03:36] shall bring the glory and honor of the
[1:03:38] nation's into it but nothing can enter
[1:03:43] therein that's a dirty word it names a
[1:03:49] murderer or longer etc won't did they
[1:03:52] have their partner like a fire now back
[1:03:54] up to four if you don't believe it
[1:03:56] you're not gonna believe it anyway back
[1:03:58] up to number four I'm sorry I made them
[1:04:02] throw it back as a fortune huh what it's
[1:04:09] manifested listen to what God says about
[1:04:13] you and me and the heathen that's never
[1:04:16] heard the gospel
[1:04:17] she'll be raised in that time and the
[1:04:22] sons of God will be manifested in the
[1:04:28] Millennium watch this is so prevalent
[1:04:31] with the people of the message until the
[1:04:32] late sixties you know what they talk
[1:04:34] ain't gonna be no manifested sons and
[1:04:36] daughters of God here in this world all
[1:04:38] gonna be in the Millennium I said then
[1:04:39] one point what do we need them in the
[1:04:41] Millennium for that's fulfilling God's
[1:04:43] work we need them now because we're sick
[1:04:45] we don't need to wait till the
[1:04:47] Millennium to have a manifested sons and
[1:04:50] daughters we need them now but listen
[1:04:53] heard the gospel shall be raised in that
[1:04:55] time the sons of God would be manifest
[1:04:57] if he's to reign he's got to have
[1:04:59] something to reign over he's got a
[1:05:02] domain and they ruled and reigned with
[1:05:04] Christ and Christ rule and reign with a
[1:05:06] rod of iron the nations then the gospel
[1:05:09] then to manifest his sons of God with
[1:05:12] the authority just like they had when he
[1:05:14] was here see they will come to the
[1:05:16] Millennium and they'll rule and reign
[1:05:17] over the heathen has never heard the
[1:05:23] gospel they're going to hear it from you
[1:05:25] you know I've tried to explain some
[1:05:29] things that I think you think I'm silly
[1:05:31] do you realize in the Millennium is
[1:05:35] you're gonna have an opportunity and
[1:05:37] those unbelievers are gonna come to you
[1:05:40] and you're going to explain Jesus Christ
[1:05:43] a gospel - it ain't gonna be just the
[1:05:48] time of playing around doing nothing
[1:05:50] what about Moses what about the great
[1:05:54] Moses they got the pattered in heaven of
[1:05:58] how to build a temple but he never knew
[1:06:02] why he put this here in that dock but
[1:06:07] around says him Jews till today do not
[1:06:09] understand them two loaves of bread
[1:06:11] that's what he said now he said them
[1:06:14] Jews don't understand that so what are
[1:06:16] you gonna do you gonna explain to it why
[1:06:19] this is here you're going to explain to
[1:06:21] this what this is here it'd be a great
[1:06:23] millennium time 24 hours a day having
[1:06:28] service dost will be in priest either
[1:06:32] hearing that and walking in the light
[1:06:38] what about it
[1:06:41] - a group of people that looks like
[1:06:45] they're worth nothing what's the reason
[1:06:49] for them to be able to be there because
[1:06:54] they were good people and lived
[1:06:59] according to the law by nature now let
[1:07:03] me ask you a simple question not is it
[1:07:07] not the fact that the new birth is the
[1:07:11] Word of God to be lived in you and I by
[1:07:14] a nature that correct
[1:07:17] and the right it's supposed to be lived
[1:07:21] by nature we're not supposed to that's
[1:07:23] this is the nature of God this is the
[1:07:26] nature of God right here the statute a
[1:07:28] perfect man is the nature of God are we
[1:07:30] not supposed to be living by according
[1:07:31] to that nature are we living in
[1:07:33] according the book of rules within
[1:07:36] what's wrong with what they were doing
[1:07:38] by nature what the jews was doing by
[1:07:41] natural and God looked at them and says
[1:07:44] this group goes out away some of them
[1:07:48] gets the right but this group can be
[1:07:50] given an opportunity to hear the gospel
[1:07:53] what a wonderful God we serve
[1:07:57] that he's mindful of every little
[1:08:00] thought and idea that we have he's into
[1:08:02] that point for the Gentiles which have
[1:08:08] not the law do by nature the things
[1:08:11] contained in the law these having not
[1:08:15] the law are a law unto themselves
[1:08:18] Roman 2:14 why can't we look at that and
[1:08:21] see it but see our problem is we want
[1:08:29] salvation for ourselves and our little
[1:08:32] groups we don't want it to give it to
[1:08:36] somebody else I've always told you and I
[1:08:42] believe it from the day and I was in
[1:08:47] this message two years before receiving
[1:08:50] the baptism in the Holy Ghost and from
[1:08:54] that day to this day I've tried to give
[1:08:59] that religion deliverance salvation away
[1:09:04] I try to give it to you try to give you
[1:09:13] the gospel which is the nature of God to
[1:09:19] explain to you the wonderful things of
[1:09:22] salvation to be given to people who do
[1:09:26] not deserve me whatsoever
[1:09:30] and if it fills you to be Kevin it that
[1:09:34] was Fitness face brother Branham said it
[1:09:38] this way one day he said God comes down
[1:09:41] every day and heals Israel he said and
[1:09:44] they wouldn't have a thing in the world
[1:09:45] to do with so when they rejected that
[1:09:51] Old Testament Jehovah as being the New
[1:09:55] Testament Jesus Christ they became
[1:09:57] unbelievers then on the day of Pentecost
[1:10:03] it came in to a Gentile dispensation the
[1:10:07] Jews were left out not left out because
[1:10:09] of
[1:10:09] use the word Gentile means Nations
[1:10:12] there's born-again Jews right truly born
[1:10:16] again believers accepting Jesus Christ
[1:10:18] as their Savior you no matter what
[1:10:20] nation you are that's why it says it was
[1:10:22] our the nations of the world the kings
[1:10:26] of the earth will bring their glory in
[1:10:28] their honor into the city as I said to
[1:10:34] have to turn walk out why because they
[1:10:39] don't have the eternal God dwelling
[1:10:41] within them they don't have that point
[1:10:46] so what is a heathen
[1:10:49] he's an unbeliever an unbeliever and the
[1:10:52] one true and living God and many
[1:10:55] unbelievers are the end of message and
[1:11:00] many of us are unbelievers bless God I
[1:11:04] got a revelation one God so it's all
[1:11:09] these doctrinal thing we even believe
[1:11:16] this was the life stock from the message
[1:11:19] that all babies go to heaven that are
[1:11:22] under the age of accountability right
[1:11:25] God is so gracious to a baby under the
[1:11:28] age of accountability we were talking
[1:11:29] about it lies not what if the world
[1:11:31] ended right today and blast it away do
[1:11:34] you realize how many billion babies
[1:11:36] would go to heaven they used to bother
[1:11:42] me when he would say destroy God would
[1:11:46] tell the people destroy all the men the
[1:11:50] women and the children listen God how
[1:11:55] could you tell him to destroy a child
[1:11:57] the child got nothing one day he finally
[1:12:02] got enough of it and spoke to me and he
[1:12:04] said by taking them getting them early
[1:12:06] I'm taking them to heaven and if they
[1:12:09] raised up they'd be in a old amirite
[1:12:11] they die and go to hell so he done him a
[1:12:14] favor and only asked you one point what
[1:12:18] is the age of accountability that was my
[1:12:22] point there Wednesday night
[1:12:23] what is the age of accountability you
[1:12:27] realize if that Jew has no understanding
[1:12:29] or that Gentile or anybody that he's
[1:12:33] earnest at back in the jungle Aborigine
[1:12:35] or that person that knows nothing about
[1:12:37] God has he ever reached the age of
[1:12:40] accountability I'll leave that question
[1:12:42] with you
[1:12:44] accountability is the ability to know
[1:12:46] the difference between right and wrong
[1:12:48] that right accountability is the ability
[1:12:51] to know the difference between right and
[1:12:52] wrong does that person that there's
[1:12:57] never heard don't give he's 80 years old
[1:13:01] what about a child that what about a
[1:13:04] person that has a mental ability that
[1:13:07] cuts them all until the 50 years old and
[1:13:10] they finally realize right and wrong you
[1:13:12] know they they haven't reached the age
[1:13:14] of accountability at that time you don't
[1:13:17] think but listen one last point and then
[1:13:21] we'll end you okay emphasize one thing
[1:13:33] that people back there when Adam and Eve
[1:13:35] sinned that put every person in the
[1:13:39] world under that condemnation you agree
[1:13:44] that's why you got to be born again
[1:13:45] because you're under that content
[1:13:47] that point of saying don't eat of the
[1:13:51] tree of knowledge it's still here today
[1:13:54] Paul said in second Corinthians I'm
[1:13:57] scared of you unless the serpent through
[1:13:59] his subtilty be call you like he did Eve
[1:14:03] now that's the point that I want to
[1:14:05] bring to make sure you understand you
[1:14:09] understand one time we're born again
[1:14:12] believers Adam and Eve had eternal life
[1:14:14] in their soul they did not go to hell
[1:14:18] when they were unbelief and and went
[1:14:20] down they just went to the grave
[1:14:21] you realize me you going to the grave as
[1:14:24] long as that unbelief is still higher as
[1:14:27] long as you've gotten play around and
[1:14:29] taught values run around he said to
[1:14:31] sympathize with something I don't
[1:14:34] believe that to soul doctor and brother
[1:14:36] Dale but
[1:14:37] I sure like to be around them because
[1:14:38] they bright I don't believe in short old
[1:14:46] money but but he does a good job
[1:14:47] preaching could you be sympathetic and
[1:14:52] could you get that spirit on you that's
[1:14:56] on that other person oh no remember you
[1:15:00] still under the curse of the fall until
[1:15:03] these bodies are changed and takes our
[1:15:05] spirit being changed we're dying
[1:15:09] the reason we're dying what is the
[1:15:14] reason we're dying unbelief unbelief in
[1:15:24] God which is the word yeah but I don't
[1:15:28] know it's not no one believe I don't
[1:15:30] either but I'll keep preaching till I
[1:15:32] find out it in Unitas when I find it
