comes also with that word we but we thank you and we ask you to just bless each and every one of us guide us now in Jesus name amen Malachi 4 and First Corinthians right now remember as I said this afternoon only the services will be at 1 45 we're trying to be in the Pulpit by two o'clock okay so we can get done okay and behold the Day comments that shall turn they'll burn as an oven and all that the proud yay and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up set the Lord of hosts said it shall lead them neither root nor branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healings in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow fish calves from the stall and you shall tread down to Wicked for they shall be acted Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this saith the Lord of hosts now let's go to First Corinthians 15 beginning with verse 12. now Christ be preached that he rose from the dead now watch and if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead I'll say some among you that there is no resurrection of the Dead and we'll get to that in a little bit because see there's a lot of people in this message even believe that there's no physical resurrection of a body that we're going to go through this kind of a change in that kind of a change and one of these days we're going to get back with it later on down the road somewhere I never did understand what he was talking about but they don't believe in the physical Resurrection I believe whatever goes down the prophet said we'll come back up Jesus died rose with nail prints in his hand amen all right see we're not looking this this body to be redeemed and that's what he's saying here and if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead I'll say something among you that there is no resurrection of thee but if there be no resurrection of the dead then Christ is not risen so amen if there's not going to be a resurrection or if it's not a resurrection then Christ is not risen all right plain sins and if Christ be not risen then our preaching is vain and your faith is also a vain yay and we are found false Witnesses oh God now what about that amen if you don't believe in the resurrection of the Dead you're a false witness amen but people in this message are still saying that they don't believe that to them all right because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ now nobody wouldn't say that Christ didn't raise amen all right they wouldn't do with that see they hold that point but it's just the rest of it all right whom he raised whom he raised not up if so be that the Dead Rising on or if the dead rise not then is Christ not raised all right and if Christ be not raised your faith is vain you are yet in your sins then you all they also which are falling asleep in Christ are perished if in this lot only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most miserable you may be seated over that is blessing to the reading of the word now I know that's plain language but I didn't write it amen I just read it that's that's the point you know and I think the word is true don't you yeah even in this message now after all the prophet is said in times that there are those that teach that there will not be a physical Resurrection um you know and uh I tried to listen earnestly to it the person that I heard was talking about it and uh you know I uh couldn't understand because like I said I know someone said you know well we don't race physically we raise in some kind of a theophany and then after we go through the Millennium and all of the things and then somewhere in the future home we get back with our body well I don't understand that I just I don't get it because Jesus didn't raise that away and you know he was the resurrection and the scripture here says that you don't don't believe in the resurrection you're still in your sins that's plain enough you know I don't have to interpret that I just read it in you know trying to get to that point now but what I want to talk about this morning is just a little message on my heart will start this afternoon on the uh you know in the study of the Book of Revelations leading up to chapter five all right but this has just been a message I've had on my heart for a while and I want to preach it this morning but now see I believe that we have proof of the resurrection and that's the title of the message that now here among us we don't have to wait we'll get to some of the things later and see I come down through some of the baddest doctrinal situations and some of you come from your churches and and what was taught about it and you know people will say well yeah we don't believe in in Divine Healing but we believe one of these days it'll all be done to set away or the other well you know I'm not arguing with nobody I'm just saying that uh I just don't see it that way because see God has given us proof that right now Among Us is already proof of the Resurrection we don't have to wait you know till a time comes it's already proof of that and it's Divine Healing amen all right now we're going from Divine Healing on in a minute we'll go over to to uh when we get in there where the Throne of righteousness will rise with healing is winning but I want to hold it to the point of thinking of Divine Healing and what it's talking about now I know and the reason they differed was run around them on a lot of things about it well see when you say Divine and they put out you know Divine healer come into town Etc now brother random emphatically stated over and over if you'd like these I could find them in a hurry for you uh he said I'm not a Divine healer he said even Jesus that's right was not a Divine healer amen he said he said that he had done only what the father showed him all right so then you know we're not talking about that and that's why the people don't misunderstood right around because when it would advertise Divine Healing see then they would take the word divine and they would interpret it and being you know and saying well Divine Healing you know this this person that believed in Divine Healing well then they bring their Doctrine as we'll cover them in it uh of saying well we don't believe in Divine Healing until the whole product is taken care of you know uh in the Mortal put on immortality well okay that's fine but you're leaving off your proof of the Resurrection you're leaving off the truth of the entire Bible that would show you know where we're at and what we're doing we don't have to wait to a time to come to have proof of things you know we can have it here while we're alive and and taking care of it but see Divine Healing then is the earnest of the Resurrection but it's proof of the Resurrection no Divine Healing now how many times do you want that off the prophet we'll read a good many of them but no Divine Healing no Resurrection all right now so if there's no Divine Healing then you know we don't have to worry about it we're just a glorified monkey off of the tree you know amen and we're just fall and go to the grave and don't worry about it you know but if we're going to believe in Christianity and the truth of the Bible then we're going to try to understand what it is and what's taking place all right but see now like I said people say well we don't believe in a Redemption of the body but we believe in the Redemption of Soul the prophet said the same word for salvation for the body is the same word for salvation for the soul he said it's the same word he said then it's all applied and he said now if Jesus Christ died let me get me the question to you and I then if he died in Rose then Redemption was over before the foundation of the world because God knew before would be saved and who wouldn't amen that's the first Doctrine to hit us when they come into message they're into in the late 60s was you couldn't be saved after 63 you know Redemption was over when the seal was broken Etc and uh I said well according to the Bible it said it was over for the world ever begun amen and so that's all right I'm not going to worry about it but now think of it Divine Healing is the earnest of the Resurrection in other words it's proof yes the if there's anybody in the world today anywhere or has ever been anybody since the foundation of the world because Divine Healing was in the Old Testament under the atonement as well as the New Testament all right but if any one person get my point now I'd like to drive it down this way if any one person was ever healed then that was Divine Healing and proof of the Resurrection all right if any one person would ever be saved any word down through time has been or whatever then it proves there is a God and let's say here and it proves that he did raise from the dead amen all right so then we don't have to worry about it we say we understand that right you know we're we're following that point but I want you to to think about it a little a little stronger today than what we've thought about it oh Divine Healing being an earnest of the Resurrection you know a down payment a part payment of the Resurrection our proof of the Resurrection and like I said now if you've ever been healed the proof is not that we read we'll read them into where your Resurrection is even inside of you right right because this is not an outside thing now talk about something somewhere else it's inside of us all right but let's get started on just reading and let the prophet of God say a few things to us and just try to come in along the way as we go and see what he's had to say about this and you say well why are you using it because we believe in it all right but do we believe in it in the correct way God would spend so much time to do all of these things and then we uh come along and say well I've read it I believe it no all right we we there's a lot of sickness Among Us right if nothing else there's a lot of old age Among Us okay yeah but see there's a lot of sickness Among Us so we need healing but are we trying to get healed to be by begging God to heal us Etc little Abby Grace Satan straightened her grandmother out nanny one day when Nanny was talking about something about feeling so bad and little Abbey Grace is five years old today's her birthday and she's not here of course and a sick this month but anyhow little Abby Grace said Nanny you're not supposed to say that you're supposed to say that you're well something to that order at least she's hurt so if she's corrected you know out of the amount of baits you know come forth wisdom all right because of confession see how do you get healed by begging God to heal you no no asking him to heal you yes but really the healing comes by the fact of stating that he has already done it and that what we need to do is thank him for it now that's hard to do sometimes when you're sick when you're hurting and all this that and the other it's hard to to say buy Stripes I'm Healed you know when we're we're feeling so bad but what else are we going to say but is that statement though now here's my point for the whole message is that statement that we make we're going to say I'm already healed all right now keep confessing that until it comes to pies amen all right and the main thing until it comes to pasting you not you know not the healing taking place but to it comes to the place that you can say within yourself but see you you've got to say what God says but now to just verbally say the words foreign to verbally say the words that's wonderful but that's a confession and you're confessing there now listen without a possession and that's good just keep confessing it for sure don't lose your confession all right all right but when it comes to a time to worry that that it just comes over you and you say I'm Healed and then it don't matter how long it takes it no matter how long it takes it takes this you had it amen to call that Faith all right now you understand what I'm saying then we've got to confess it until it comes to a possession but that's where a problem is like I've always tried to describe to you and I'm I'm sorry I just be I'm honest but you see people say we're cancer and they hold on when they're told they got cancer they say bye Stripes I'm Healed I want everybody to know it put it in the newspaper put it on these all of these things websites and send it to everybody that I'm Healed oh God says I'm Healed and I believe it all right but then after about three or four months things starts getting a little worse you know their testimony begins to dwindle away and sure they'll say oh yeah I I still believe that I'm Healed um but I think I better go to the doctor well let's do it you would have went and start with no problem we're going the first time amen but then you start saying what the doctor says then you'll start propping it up okay now I've got this cancer and and what I'm doing I'm trying to show you you're losing your faith all right because you can do that for healing you can lose your faith that's right and you start saying well you know maybe they need me as a guinea pig to try this new medicine so let's try but I still healed God's A Healer no you just lost your confession you're back to a mental thought right you're back to saying what the word says but not possessing the reality of it and here I start coughing okay my stripes on heels all right but see in doing that then if we lose our confession it's not God's fault it's ours the sickness comes back if you heard the prophet say it like this he said you can be healed of something today he said tomorrow can come back because healing is not Eternal right right that's why they just sent a moment ago they they had problems with the way that it was said about Divine Healing through brother Brown's Ministry because they would take the word divine as being like Eternal right and then you could never get sick again well see that's not correct right around never talk nothing like that the Bible don't teach nothing like that all right see then getting now to the point Divine Healing if there is no Divine Healing then there is no Resurrection all right but now here's where we get down and we dwindle on that and we take that as no Divine Healing no Resurrection when I'm sick I'm sick but that don't have anything to do with the resurrection huh but you see then we lose our faith by our confession of negativism by saying you know and even try to say it this way we say I I know it's him you can't tell me I ain't healed well who you're arguing with amen you arguing with me are you arguing with God about it but then when you say no Divine Healing no Resurrection we're not having any signs of Wonders Among Us so we're wondering what about the resurrection now you surely have got into a bad trap of the devil because I don't care if God never heals anybody else he is the Healer I don't care if he ever saves anybody else he was a savior amen why can't we actually say it that way but see we always want to have some kind of assumption to prop it up with or to to base it upon well we've seen this we've seen that oh back in brother Brown's Ministry you know they had healings and signs and wonders now there's a statement I want to make to you thank you I wish you'd write this down during the time because we'll get back to it in a little while of the greatest and of signs and wonders that the world has ever seen and I'll give it to you in a minute we're brought around said that there's more people healed in one of his meetings than even is written in the Bible of the Lord Jesus but he said now the Lord Jesus doesn't it he never took no credit right all right we get what I'm saying during the time of the greatest healing campaigns that the world ever existed you know ever saw right worldwide we talk about revivals being worldwide this was a Divine Healing campaign that stripped the world right all right during that time is when the prophet made the statements no Divine Healing no Resurrection I wish you'd write that down put it in your computer home you know what I'm talking about your brain let it float around up there a while and maybe it'll drop down a little lower you know to get into the soul but just think about it how many times go run it in your computer I don't I didn't look it up and see how many times but I'm sure it would go into 40 50 times or more that the prophet said no Divine Healing no Resurrection during the time that he would say bring me 24 of your worst cases and I'll guarantee you healing for every one of them during the time that he would say more healings in one one service than it's written in the Bible amen it's during that time he was making no statements well what's he talking about surely he's not talking about that there was not any signs and wonders because they were worldwide amen well what is he dealing with what is he dealing with what does Divine Healing speak of now let's get him to a go ahead and pull up number one brother and let's read a little bit of what the prophet had to say this was the message of the ten virgins paragraphs 11. now I underlined to emphasize but you underline the whole plan all right and I do believe in Divine Healing it's one of the greatest doctrines of the Bible that was 1960 12 11 in the morning series but Divine Healing has more to it than just Divine Healing amen Divine Healing only says that there is a God who's coming again now if you isolated that statement you would have a very negative point Divine Healing only says so you you emphasize the only and you're breaking it down very narrow but if you boost up the only you're getting it in the right order divide him even when he says that there's a God who's coming again it means he's he's going to be here he's going to come huh what does Divine Healing speak of it's the earnest of the Resurrection see and if there is no Holy Spirit now to baptize us there is no eternal life in the world to come I like the way he makes statements don't you right those are straight plain and don't need to be interpreted do they the Bible said this is the earnest of our salvation and you know what the earnest is it's the down payment see if you'll go down and pay say you bought a farm you just wanted to put the money down but what is it the baptism of the holy spirit is just the earnest of what's coming or what will it be like then amen Divine Healing is an earnest of a glorified Eternal Body amen now the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the earnest of the completion of redemption that would take us to a change of the body so we don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're in bad shape to start with right it's for everybody right but everybody won't receive it that's right right salvation is for everybody but everybody won't receive it amen all right so now whose problem is it is our problem see we reject the way that God does things you know and then we try to figure it out and then we quote somebody else who was it buddy Robinson I believe it was I heard about this preacher one time say that too and I believe it was Buddy Robinson went out in the cornfield who was it looked around referred to was there and he said God if you don't save me said you'll find a pile of bone sitting right here amen well I heard that statement before I come in dementia of people you know that would make that shape see that was more or less a positive statement well I now the one wrote around was talking about got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but now that's just saying what somebody else says all right see I extend your talk to you all day about the healings that God has done in his body but you know that will not do you any good and right unless you believe it my blood type had totally been changed from a positive to a negative medically proven medically proven the doctors is the one that said it huh but see they don't I won't heal you but all that does is shows you as we're reading there then God is here if you hear one person why wouldn't he heal anybody out well we say well maybe it's not for me that's exactly right it's not for you if you believe that that's it it's not for you because your confession is wrong but what is Divine Healing speak of now Divine Healing only is only the earnest but it says that there is a God who's coming right all right Divine Healing says there's a God that's coming because it has to tie on over to immortality In the Flesh to take this one out of here in the coming of the Lord right we'll get to that in a moment but Divine Healing it speaks of greater things than just healing the prophet see it it speaks of the Resurrection amen R is proof of the Resurrection all right now as I said if you've ever been healed you've had proof in your body amen if you've ever seen anybody else that was healed you had proof in your body in the body you got it there you can see it all right well now let's just get into earnestly thinking see because here's where the Prophet go ahead with number two he says I'm actually called phase paragraph 1 1961 813. when you've got to use faith in when you've got to use faith in God to make it work see so you've got your own Resurrection inside of you so now the heroes inside of you amen if the resurrection is inside of you that's right the savior is inside of you all right no if you're born again all right now the reason an actual person to make sure nobody don't misunderstand it to a natural person not born again can receive healing they believe it but they don't have an inside person to confess their heel so they're only doing it from their mental conception and it produces well what about a born-again Christian I believe this is what you're talking about don't you yeah you talking about a born-again Christian that has laying inside of you your Resurrection right Resurrection is not laid inside of a sinner come on it's land inside of the true born-again Christian the other is a mental concept that produces and you go beyond your natural thinking until you can believe it and be healed you see people walking across the platform healed healed healed and then a Christian lose it not get it amen is that true good luck see your Resurrection lays inside of you and your spirit now you know when Jesus died on the cross his soul descended into hell then preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not in the long suffering and they don't know his body went into the grave but before he died he committed his Spirit into the hands of God into the hands into thy hands commit my spirit so you see his Spirit went to God his soul went to hell his body went to the grave but now that spirit that was in him was the spirit of God and that spirit and sundered times and diverse matters anointed the prophets to bring the message to the people in the last days through Christ and now in these days through the gospel all right so what are we talking about your soul is being his person his spirit we can go through explaining the difference in Soul and Spirit to do we're in the early Ministry in a way he brought it and then he brought it into the later in the ministry to show him because in the early Ministry he put Body Soul spirit but in the later Ministries it was Body Spirit and soul but it doesn't matter he was explaining the you you don't have to worry about whether or not he corrected that he always said the body has five cents and she takes Fields metal here the second Rim whatever you call it you want to call it Joe Jim or Charlie it still would be counted five cents it reads the memory conscious effect then the inner Center Rim only had one chance all right so now get what are you saying Jesus went to hell his soul went to hell what raised him the Bible says if the spirit that was in him that raised him from the dead be in you that's right it will Quicken or make alive your mortal body amen truth and all we got to worry about is whether we got the new birth or not and that's where the Prophet said the most important thing in your life is whether you're mourning it or not and well people nowadays don't even kick the new birth they're so glorified into the message and throw anointed and so up into the great Realms of the of the the what they call them actually until they don't even talk about the New Birth anymore have you heard even somebody preaching justification sanctification of baptism and all another now that we're beyond that you'll be on what I mean you kind of got your foundation Knocked Down Under yet amen right you kind of mentioned it up all right but now think about it think about what's being said all right within him laid the resurrection Within You by the new birth lays that same Resurrection all right so now fishing with inside of you why are you hunting from somewhere else man why are you trying to Pump It Up prime it up no now I I don't want to listen I know I say things that I shouldn't say but I just try to make a point I know a people that you've heard of them probably and probably might have done it but I know some brothers told me one time that they played tapes 24 hours a day in their home well that's wonderful now I'm not saying anything against that heaven forbid I'm not talking against it I'm just saying plain language what good did it do that's right and people like to take all of the you know do it and I try to they take all of the healing campaign you know all of the healing lines are the prophet and they put it out into tapes where you can just play it over and over and over and over and over well let's do it maybe there's something in there will cause a mental connection to be able to bring somebody to heal it but you know I never have understood all about how people had to do everything because and I believe firmly in Divine Healing I've done confession activities okay if you want to hear some more about the things that was in this body that was corrected you you just would talk about it because I've seen it done I've seen everything but blinded eyes open and sister back there we're certainly praying about that and believing it the dead rays are still healed and everything else so we believe in Divine Healing so now when I make this statement don't misunderstand it you know that the greatest prophet of all the Bible speaks of and we're not talking about brother random in this day John the Baptist amen John the Baptist the introducer of the Lord Jesus Christ the man who stood there to do the greatest work that could ever be and not one shine following his ministry amen well yeah we build everything on signs and wonders well that's a good reason I believe in it but it also be the devil's trap too because you know yourself there's more of the many hens and the the people that's out there now on the healings that are taking place that's right right why don't you just go out there with him I mean what's holding you here if you're looking for signs and wonders now come on folks and then I'm telling you there's nobody in this building that leaves and signs and wonders more than this man does because I've seen it I walked out and I've confessed it until it come to pass all right yeah so in doing that then what are we talking about in the greatest time of all that could be here are the statements the prophet is saying the greatest healing campaigns that ever struck the world and he's saying no Divine Healing no Resurrection and he says it speaks of greater things let's think about that boy number three really respect to enjoy 57 18 67. if Jesus is raised from the dead listen if it's for me and you that's not for him right he's not infinite he's not wondering where it's right or not when the Bible said if the spirit that was in him and that's not wondering about whether it's right or not that could even if you and I all right if Jesus Christ is raised in the dead then then he's already healed he's already saved they ain't be talking about an individual above here but he's talking about truth right that's right that if Jesus Christ is raised in the Dead then the healing is over with the Salvation is over with amen it's whether or not we can believe it right right he's not going to die again he's not going to be beaten again for the blood for our stride you know he looks already done it simple language right he took away your worry he's Jehovah's original he's Jehovah Rapha he's every name tonight that he was then he is now and the blood of Christ has covered and redeemed you from everything that Adam did to you now you don't have you don't have it in the fullness I'm watching I mean this is a man standing there to guaranteed healing for 24 cases you know and nobody's ever done that outside the Lord Jesus but he's telling you but you don't have it in the formation huh but you have it as the earnest of your salvation if there's no Divine Healing there's no Resurrection now there's that statement is he running it too no signs and wonders taking place when they were taking place no we're telling how many people was healed in this minute and this message it is I'm quoting from what does he saying if there's no but you have it as the earnest of your salvation the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the earnest amen your soul the prophet Africa got it in here he said your soul is not complete man my code is not Phoenix that's the factor of perfect man that's all the things that's coming up in adoption and all of that all right now your healing is not complete because you can be healed today sick tomorrow all right but you've got the earnest of it right all right let's see if there's no Divine Healing there's no Resurrection that's right if there's no joy in the Lord then there's no joy there in the Lord we just got the earnest that's the down payment of the what would it be when we see him and get the full value of his Redemption man man I said when they said divine Divine see the preachers immediately picked up and began to say Divine healer oh this guy thinks he's going to heal you and he said I can't do that he said if even Jesus was standing here in this suit of clothes on and I said he couldn't heal you man my brother I think he wouldn't remember what well is that right or wrong and he's already healed us he's already saved us all we got to do is confess it amen until we possess it keep on saying it keep on saying it don't ride over my tombstone he died for this right away he just got wore out but now listen listen God's Commission commissioning Moses 1963 606. he's 16. now listen he's talking about Dr best right and when they had the meeting up there and you know the pillar fire came down and I think well you know what he said Dr Beth when they finally turned it over to him uh you know Dr vest preached him a good Camelot sermon now that's not talking about Alexander Campbell he was in on those parts but a good Methodist or good bad discernment probably like you do now but you know you wasn't even listening listen to what Dr best says and see if it if you can remember when you heard it that way he said I was robbed in a Bagless Trail and that's something for a prophet to say that I know what Baptist Doctrine is he preached now here's the Baptist Doctrine he said no no we bad this we didn't here's the Baptist doctor and that's what your Prophet is saying amen huh he preached that after this Mortal immortality when this Mortal puts on immortality that'll be Divine Healing and that's Baptist doctor in other words he means that's organized religion Doctrine amen now watch it he said well sure we'll tell you when there's more to put you on immortality that'll be Divine Healing sure we play that but if you're sitting here saying we believe that we believe in Divine when it takes place but there's no healing now we're just here in this world and we gotta go to the doctor and we got to do this and we got to do that you know and that's what people turn out to be looked well sure we all believe that but what about this if there's if we have no Earnest of our salvation the blessing that we have in our heart of the baptism of the holy spirit is the earnest watching them are the down payment if there's no Divine Healing there's no resurrection of the body amen there's no Earnest of it so we have the earnest of our Salvation now amen see we have within us as we're quoting there a moment ago our own Resurrection lays within us not our Resurrection no more than run around they'd say well you know so many people were healed he said Jesus done it amen to Jesus in my Ministry heal more than one service than he did in the written writing of the Bible he's not talking about himself man let's see salvation we have the blessings of Salvation which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost we have the blessing of the Divine Healing for our bodies which is the earnest of a glorified body and we'll read that in a minute the earnest of our body to be able to make it glorified is the fact that it can be healed now amen what are we talking about he not just talking about no Divine will ain't no Divine Healing ain't no Resurrection or nothing so we just don't see nothing I keep emphasizing that during the time that this man would guarantee healing for people he's saying these statements oh no Divine Healing no Resurrection now I sure would want to see a whole lot more of God um but if he never healed anybody else I'm still anchoring what he said all right see if we can be that then we don't have to worry about it the cause of life and the things like that won't worry us look at the next one E7 which is 1951 718. not healing now there's no resurrection of the place right on this thing Divine Healing is the earnest of our redeemed body uh surely we would understand that if God and God can give you plenty of these we'll run around and talk about a person you know cancer eating up person laying there and he said in a matter of a few minutes see him standing up walking and thinking amen see if we can believe that church why can't we believe what Divine Healing is earnest of our redeemed body Resurrection amen all right now if there's no Divine Healing then when you go at the grave that's all of it but nobody even when you go to grave that's all of it you'll be there forever and your dust will go away and there will be no more of you that's pretty blonde isn't it amen seeing if we have the earnest of our salvation and completeness back the way we was in the Garden of Eden all right now watch and I think that the power of God that would take a cancer-ridden woman here that the doctors had just give a few days and she's one of the thousands that's on record not just the man the person's testimony but the doctor's testimony one of the thousands and her eat up with a few hours to live my cancer and by the earnest of her redeemed body will put her in the condition it is now in other words healing right and the condition is that what would it be when she draws the full value of the resurrection of Jesus Christ man that's just the down you know what the down Easter initiative part payment and that cancer and everything like that she's sitting well to normal see that not only just speaks of a healing God that speaks of a glorified body so there's no Divine Healing there's no glorified body huh put time together the glorified body it's not tied together just that if there's no healing than what we got we're going out there then I mean I'm honest I don't have no problem I just try to be in what I am all the time this is the way I talk every time all the services not just one you know me this church was never built on the basis and tried to beg somebody to come to church it's never been built on that I know I'm not a good pastor I agree with you 100 the most pastors when somebody lays out of church they call them up want to know what's wrong I don't know care about hearing when I understand I just don't turn them back here and all that so I just don't do it if I'm wrong I'm wrong I'm sorry you're supposed to call me it doesn't say in the Bible for the pastor to call a sick to pray for him he said if you're sick call the pastor for the elders or somebody yeah it's not just the bases and this church ain't been built on trying to beg people to come you know I know I ain't no no good at it and I'm sorry but it's just not built that way it's built on one thing whether the word is here or not man I did not take care of the rest of it right but you see what he's talking about the full value of the resurrection of Jesus Christ see when he raised he not only healed because that was the only way that the life that was within him could come out of him it was a death amen and when he raised me no wonder the scripture said he is risen and let's say he has risen or was will raise or what he said he is risen right now she's in the full resurrection of Jesus Christ will go all the way to the change of these bodies that's what I believe that's why I believe in healing so I believe in God Among Us see I just love to see it more you know what our problem is you know and the problem with God it's us my father said you go down the courts and do it if you just us you know well that's about true it's just us it's causing us a problem but see note about healing no resurrection and not just talking about we don't have the signs and wonders so keep repeating it during the time of the greatest healing campaigns the world has ever seen is a man talking about no Divine Healing no Resurrection amen Joy evidently must be pointing to that resurrection and tying it more into proving other than just healings but he's taking it to the glorified body all right now according to my understanding if I'm wrong correct me I never knew that people that were Sinners that were didn't have the new birth would get a glorified body and don't ask me what kind they did I don't know I ain't worried about it I know they don't have it connected to the new birth the our new birth is connected our Resurrection the baptism of the Holy Ghost glorified body total eternity of the entire person that you're looking at amen because it were Christians we're Christians all right and believe in it to understand it I don't mind giving you even statements like this look at the next one but I tell you I'll give you all of it but then we try to put it all together see what it's talking about now let's talk about the death side now how could this is a demonology Physical Realm 53 608 paragraph 40. and how could a person on that estate in that kind of a condition ever be said now the Lord Jesus Christ was even sin right but look before he's making how could he even be sick because that your body is not yet redeemed amen now all right now you go to Future home and he'll tell you that that your soul is redeemed waiting the Redemption of your body but then he'll tell you in the message what he's already we're already renamed but he's just making a straight honest statement you know what our problem is the reason we're sick of course everybody's not Eternal and does that need a big boat to turn on our bodies are not eternal the Redemption that's done finished but it hasn't been applied to the Physical Realm of mankind so then the prophets say your body's not redeemed huh but he's not contrary to the Bible it will tell you already redeemed he's explaining this realm out here that we're in your body's not redeemed no matter how much or how good you are or a saintly or how holy how much Holy Spirit that's only your soul and your soul is not complete yet it's just got the Bless you that's right amen then he says no Divine Healing no Resurrection you're talking about the Redemption of the entire person proof of the Resurrection if God can come down and heal a body now we need disease well whatsoever any thought headache or any problems he could do that in his proof that he can raise it up well because he's already raised he went through Divine Healing didn't he as the world caused Divine Healing he went to eternal life he went to immortality in the flesh why because he paid the price all right but we're not trying to get into heal us there's a problem we're trying to figure out some way and it's good what do we do when we get sick we start repenting right which is good but the first thing you do is start repenting you start trying to clean up that's good but I don't heal you that's what he just said no matter how good you are what's going on I don't hear you I just like fasting fasting doesn't do anything but one thing you should be fast you do this fasting only gets you out of the way it don't bring God on the scene that's right it only gets you out of the way then he can come on the scene yes I know I got in trouble years ago quote I'm going to random right around and said I never fasted over three days of my life now you want that quote he said there's no such thing in the Bible of a 40-day fashion amen now we know the Lord Jesus did he said the reason he did cause he's God because we can't live 40 days without food I know some of them's trying to do it make pictures and they have a big fat belly and the next time you see them they're standing there you know in the pants and photo know what to do they suck their belly in and get about 10 size too big and pull them around they don't buckle them up make it look like and you know that's no joke it's true because there ain't no such thing as a 40-day package fasting only gets you out of the way the prophet said if you're led to fast you'll not get hungry amen I can witness that that's right but then I've tried it on my own and got you hungry I've been glad to eat anything in the world right that's right but now listen see we're trying to conquer this body let me say this to you we think if we can conquer this body that some way we can bring about healings and different things and I just got to say it repentance is good see we don't have that that's wonderful don't stop doing that because I know one person told one time said the way y'all preach about us being God in flesh that then we don't have to repent because who do we repent to if we're God I said you didn't understand what's being taught we are children of God we're God in human flesh right but that don't do away with God and that don't do away with the fact that we do wrong because the Bible says and the prophet said only Christians have sins because everybody else is condemned on a higher level amen don't tell me brother Dale I'm a sinner no I'm not going to tell you God did huh no I got born again ain't no sin in me to run around and said that lady you know Jack Cole said that time I said about the lady that got a friend said you know I ain't told a line whatever so he said lady said she said I want to lay my tongue when I ordered he said ladies there's only 14 foot across here and it ain't long enough why because reacted he acting or lying about it Bible said if you say you have not sinned you are a liar but now if Christ in US can't see him so don't blame the one on the inside amen it's this body and spirit we're dealing with and that's our problem yeah that's what I'm talking about now we try to move something to put it into a place to justify the reasons of these things and there's no need to try to justify anything just face up and go right straight at it and look right at it and just just see all right look at the next one this is a message called Fellowship um 1955 813. e14 paragraph and Jesus came to restore the human race everything that he lost and eaten we were on our road okay good point now we have the earnest of that Deliverance now if we have the earnest wonderful that's good it'll come in time but give me the earnest you know you go down and you put down money on a car Ernest yeah right you put down money on a house you know you got so long and of course you don't make the payments after then they're gonna come and get it but you got so long that they can't touch that one because it's an earnest amen and they got to give you a certain amount of time all right so if I just have the earnest of mine heard if I just have healing in my body that God has manifestation if I just have the new birth simply as just a vape in Christ I still got it you know brother Gary's talking about this the other day you know God revealed something to you Glory Hallelujah stand back but you try to figure out the rest of it it won't work we're supposed to take one step at a time but you only step when you see what's in front of you we're not trying to walk on water we're trying to walk on the word then if it takes it he can move out through the water I don't have to worry about sinking oh man well you understand what I'm saying if I just got an Earnest or something Gloria Hallelujah that's why I've always been the way of being church and I've always tried to preach you no take away the earnest from the people amen the church we were in the pastor started preaching it you didn't have the new birth like in in the book of Acts and I sat there and cried when he would tell people and they'd say but brother uh I I received a new birth no you just got an anointing I'll explain it to you one day so you were taking away everything in the world that those people had don't take away what somebody's got if it's just a word stand on that word keep moving don't worry about it well I don't worry about my time or not what do you mean who's winning the hell is not and if God reveals something to you don't worry about it come to pass but the problem is it's hard to wait sometime for that to come to pass right and we want to try to make it work on it look at the next what do we got I'm still on that one okay deliverance we have the Holy Spirit which is the life of God in a portion portion or a small part okay when we are in his presence at the end of life then we will have the full spirit this is called the earnest of our Salvation now we also believe that we'll have an immortal body someday when Jesus comes these vile bodies will be changed and we'll have a body like his own glorious body how many believe that thank you I'm happy to see that you believe that I look for that day myself notice if we have that and that was included in Redemption we've got to have Divine Healing for the earnest in order we've got the salvation of the Soul knowing we've got to have Divine Healing for the earnest of our complete deliverance huh if there's no Divine Healing there's no resurrection of the Dead how about that teach ER if there is no Divine Healing there's no Resurrection Divine Healing is the earnest of the Resurrection if the holy spirit is here and that is the earnest of our eternal life do you believe that if you have eternal life in your soul by the new birth that's the earnest amen there's no way to lose that now we can lose healing but we can't lose salvation belated the vulnerabations of our confession we keep confessing the crucified let me get a few more we'll just try to cover this because I don't know we ain't gonna get to the last part I finished the season go ahead with the next this is paragraph 72 who is this MailChimp paper 72 73 74. well it's just melted at 65 to 21 evening and what is it the earnest of the Resurrection if you'll notice what I do a lot of times I I wish you would pay close attention that last quote was from 56. this quote is from 65. I like to do that because a lot of people say well he changed his mind later yeah amen he talked different later when I where's it at do they say now well he he talked a new bird back here but now he taught the new birth different in the later mention I'd like to see that called future home he said I taught three processes from a boy but see they don't want to hear that quote but listen what he's saying and what is it the earnest on the resurrection this body will be raised again because it's already started it was once subject to sin and mind ain't talking about your body this body will be raised again because it's already started man well I want to get in the resurrection I want this out of the other so really started again that's right I like that song He's still working on me yeah watch it but it's got to be Earnest I went a few it was 170 percent in my introduction but now it's got the earnest it's turned Evelyn now that's the earnest that you're going into rapture a sick person laying down nothing left but dead that's all can happen I've seen a shadow of people who've done eat up with cancer and tuberculosis and sitting them persons a little while after that perfectly normally strong if there's no Divine Healing then there's no Resurrection because Divine Healing is the earnest of the Resurrection see my point church is one thing to me all of the quotes coming from the prophet during the time of the greatest healing campaigns it's ever been of no Divine Healing no Resurrection he's not condemning us because we're not having great humongous signs and wonders Among Us it's condemning us because we do not believe the reason we're not having signs and wonders among us like we would like to have is because we do not believe I am praying and have been now for about three months for a Revival among the people all right but now yours your the problem when I said Revival you're thinking about something much like the Pentecostal Revival on Azusa Street that's wonderful but that can happen in this day to non-believers of a Revival because they can mentally work herself into a position to believe me and the prophets did in the last days God would pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh the Bible says it the prophet said what kind of Revival brother Dale are you looking for revived Hearts amen right around and made a statement one time I remember years ago when I first heard it he said I had rather see love in a church listen then to see it was either five or ten thousand should saved well you got quiet so did I when he said amen what do you mean you'd rather see love among the people than to see ten thousand people saved see you don't know the rest of the quotes see the rest of the quote is if you get love among the people you're going to have a whole lot more than ten thousand people saying so I'm praying for a Revival of Love among the people not free love no Hallelujah a love of Brotherly kindness amen but this church right here needs more than anything in the world is a Revival of Brotherly kindness amen tell me you won't even hardly speak to the other person would you claim to go into the same heaven right yeah that's right suffering just left all right a Revival to come Among Us to put us so much in love with Jesus Christ until we be so much in love with each other until it won't be any problem brother Dale if you get straight down I love you more when that's all right just pray for me but is that going to make you love anybody I thought love was conditioned upon yourself right I didn't know love was if you love me I love you I didn't think that worked that way I thought it worked I love you whether you love me or not I love my wife whether she ever loves me if not that's that's her part of the end of the deal that's not mine and we don't we don't want to get into talking like that do we but we're going in a rapture okay we can also go to the nation I get free should I'm doing the wrong thing I know it's not hurt feelings sorry about it this is e47 taken from Abraham Bridge 66 1208. see I'm going backwards and four active before every person would ever healed every person would ever say would say when Jesus died at the cross and finished and every person ever healed every person ever saved was saved when Jesus died at the cross and finished the work he screamed to the father is finished all of it the complete Plan of Salvation and now we have the earnest of our Salvation now Divine Healing is not on the same basis of Salvation now we know that's true right well you can be sick today you'll be healed and be sick it's not eternal with salvation for the shoulders eternal healing is not on the same basis as salvation now why he's not saying it's not on the same base you've got two different bases now you understand he's not saying two different bases this is based on this and it's based on that no it's all based on faith but it's simply the fact that you can be sick and healed and sick and healed but you can't do that in Salvation you're not saved and lost saved and lost saved and all right at least we ought to be far enough to know that it's not on the same basis Divine Healing was included in the atonement truly the old atonement had Divine Healing and the new one is much better than the old one so if it's better it's got to be better in every way but Divine Healing salvation is of the soul and you become a new creature eternal life you don't have eternal Health by healing amen all right nurses basis right but it's an attribute it's the earnest of your Resurrection if there's no Divine Healing then there's no Resurrection see but now what is it it's your own personal faith in a finished work of Christ now let me just turn over to the back here and just preach a little bit and we'll leave these it says in Malachi 4. that the son of righteousness would rise in healing with healing in his wings all right now as I was keep stating that during the time of the greatest Revival of healings and things and they they credit brother Brown and Oral Roberts as being the two of the beginning of the Divine Healing campaigns in other words Etc to sweep it out now FF Bosworth and then was way on back Seymour and then was our in the healings and signs and wonders took place right but to bring it out like they did even the world the religious world even credits would have ran them into the beginning of it now and in that town he would say no Divine Healing no resurrection of the greatest signs and wonders could take place now I've tried to preach this to you back then a long time ago to get you to see because it says in Malachi 4 that the son of righteousness would rise with healings in his land so it was a healing campaign that started back there all right but we've read over and over to proof of what we're talking about no Divine Healing no Resurrection all right the Resurrection The the new birth covers it for the soul the resurrection of the body is an example of healing of the body then he can change the body right all right now he then the son of righteousness would rise see he not only left us because healing has been here uh it's reason I got to that point I'll just cut it off with the rest of the nation and do it this way we covered that that healing was under the Old Testament atonement all right we just read it and he lives in the New Testament atonement he said even greater why because you've got the inside believed right right where's the person the Old Testament don't have an outside right they were believing in their spiritual realm and their their body but not in their soul because her Soul's lost but in the New Testament your soul is pure and clean so then you can believe and accept God and believe it all right but the son of righteousness would rise with healings in his wind so he not only left us with that statement gee if you understand what I believe a prophet would do it not Divine Healing no Resurrection all right you see Paul could have said don't Divine Healing no Resurrection Irene is Martin Colombo Luther Wesley right Azusa Street Pentecost no Divine Healing no Resurrection they could have said that because that's true because this is that's what I'm trying to get you to look at but then here in the end time God would send a Divine Healing campaign that would sweep out and cover the world what proof that the resurrection was coming right that's right proof that they would be a physical Resurrection coming all of the times the prophet would stand there in those healings and was proof that a resurrection was coming in other words it was speaking of it do you see a Divine Healing campaign sweep the world I'm going out there in the son of righteousness rise with healing in his wings until the world had to confess but see God was doing that because he was fixing the brain a prophet on the scene right that's right amen do we just didn't bring the prophet on the scene and let him start his message come on what'd he do he brought a healing campaign to cover the world to show that God is real and that healing campaign slip out then out of there a man started with his message and you read the message of the Rapture in a different place and I'll be glad to show them to you but run around and said his message begun in the seals another Reformation didn't begin in the 40s that was a restoration back to the Bible that was what they were saying that was what they were teaching he come into the third in 63 he came into his message he said not the years of preparation go read it he brought his message begun with no seals open all right and went forward because that was a message to the end time but now listen to what I'm saying and this is the point if there had to be a Divine Healing forerun the mission now we know what the prophet said right healing was what Bay on the hook to get the attention of the people where they would hear the message all right now all down through there he was preaching but he was preaching the same Peter and Paul and James and John and all them preached right bringing it back to talk about the faith of the father but then the message would come now if if gun healing is proof in the resurrection now you're listening then the message the prophet brought would be that Resurrection into the higher form Amen to be able to take us to the change of these bodies because it was none of them taught the statue of a perfect man Even though Peter and him preached it but they couldn't attain unto the position to bring a chain to the body right a sensual it didn't happen well you shouldn't say they couldn't make I'm not saying they couldn't I said they didn't they didn't they couldn't all right argue with that but listen then that Divine Healing campaign only spoke of that brother that God was going to send a message that would not be used to message his people thinks about but would be the very message of the Resurrection that's why that Prophet would stand there and he said the son of man was back there man who said he could tell the people their thoughts he said and let me stand here and God used me to tell you your thoughts what Joy even in his early Ministry that the son of man was already coming into view but then one day the son of man came to bring his message not right around him the Lord Jesus Christ came down United with the prophet of God in 63 and started bringing the message right amen sure he was using the man he had to but that not only showed listen no Divine Healing no Resurrection that could be said all the way down through time what's in here we're going to profit and what was he saying can I translate something to you where it won't offend you when he was saying no Divine Healing no Resurrection after the opening of the seals what was he saying please no he was saying if you don't get the message and can't stand on Divine Healing what are you going to do when uh a bunch of Bible say if you can't keep up with the footman he said then there's no way to worry about keeping up with the horsemen right right you're saying the message I've just brought to you is the resurrection and if we have the Holy Spirit within us and that is the resurrection with inside of us and if we have the Holy Spirit we'll agree with the message there's the proof of whether you're born again or not it's whether or not you can agree with the nation now not just agree with sometimes like I told you the other day when I was preaching marriage and divorce yeah people are oh I won't marriage and divorce I won't be set free for my my uh things that I've wronged where I had too many wives or too many husbands or whatever you know I'm glad I set free Oh Glory to God he was a prophet then you said well what about this well I don't believe he's right down we don't want you just lost your marriage you just lost your grace you made a disgrace you just lost it you say all you want in the rest of your life I'm free if you don't believe the prophet he said this is to my followers only now followers mean followers right they don't mean leaders and going the opposite direction right right man but everybody's trying to straighten out the man that brought the grace of marriage and divorce amen I'm saying he's wrong here what year did I already been this you see this message it's proof of a glorified body amen they've never been anybody in the Bible come on listen to me I know what Paul and him taught I know what Peter them taught and they talked to daily walks in Salvation Etc yeah right but none of them would ever concerned with the Redemption of the body right because it was not the day that's right that's right this is the day for the body to be redeemed Hallelujah I'm talking about physical amen not talking about change of the body without this message there would be no change I'm talking about this prophet's message that started in 63. that would bring the chains in the body but there was a Divine Healing campaign struck back there and went for it to prove that there was something coming the Shelton coming was the message right not the message about something but the message optional the message of eternal life come on to quit I've even invited you to do this get one of those books where you can look at the titles of the sermons you know what I'm talking about yeah the index books just get one one day and just sit down and turn over the Earth to 63. and start reading the titles of the sermons just the tiles read the titles of the sermon you had all of those back there you know about Jezebel religion all kind of things you know but when you get after the seals he preached in 57 that Melchizedek was almighty God back and read it but when he preached it again he preached who is this he always preached that Jesus was one true and living God but he preached Christ in this community of God just read the titles future home of the Heavenly bridegroom Earthly bride yes things that are to be Mighty God unveiled invisible Union this day the scriptures fulfilled amen just read the titles of the sermon you can see the message went into eternal life amen while we're living no that we can't have a resurrection of Divine Healing while we're living then there is no resurrection of the body right if we can't have salvation to deliver us now by the soul of eternal life then there is no eternal life to come and but if we can get it all together it'll come to the right place no Divine Healing no Resurrection no salvation no eternal life to come we just die and go by the grave oh no no we don't believe that I agree with you we don't believe that believe that but that's what we're talking about amen as I said there a moment ago the Baptists Don't Preach well we don't want healing or nothing now because we don't want to do this they just preaching stuff for them yeah if God wants you ever heard him I've been married if God wants to heal now he can do what he wants to because he's God but we just don't believe it that's right and we just don't teach it that way why were there so much against brother Branham when he was going forward with a healing campaign if they believed in healing why was there so much against daddy Seymour and them into the juicer Street when they were going forth with a great Revival and he even said to Chef I was reading it yesterday out of some things of Wade has on the rooster Street and he said himself he said this is not basis on healing excuse me he said it's not just based on speaking in tongues he said it's not gestational speaking in tongues he said this is based upon God living among us a sister Street was God living among us we'll get down there this afternoon to wear a suitcase street but around said had the baptism of the Holy Ghost judge in the book of Acts now can you say Amen to that amen amen well we'll listen you might say oh me because a lot of people don't believe it that's okay with you we went food on the batteries and they run out but just turn this on the microphone let's stand together you might have a knee without a meeting yourself 2.99 299 beneath your name thank you Lord I am 40 pounds this afternoon tears thank you every energy and we're the same of God is thank you they'll be alive
