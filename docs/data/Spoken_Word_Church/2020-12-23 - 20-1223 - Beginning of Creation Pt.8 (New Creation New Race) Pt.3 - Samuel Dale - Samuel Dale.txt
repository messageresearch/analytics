[Music] shining in the light of your glory amen pour out your love bless me oh the holy amen [Applause] shining in the light of your glory you love him pour out your power and love [Music] holy holy holy [Music] [Applause] amen and amen and amen yes lord amen and amen and i want to see him don't you i mean good to see everybody in the house of the lord we don't get to ever say the ones downstairs because we don't know how many is down in the basement but you can see us so where you can know that we're thinking about you and everything and all and just enjoy the presence of the lord from there as much as you can from up here you know so it'd be fine good to see everybody if you'd like to turn into scriptures turn to revelations 3 14 where we've been reading from and then we'll go to genesis 1 and genesis 2. try to pick up her thought and continue on to what we've been doing remember to pray for all of these remember brother uh homer to pray for him the lord would touch him and all and all the others talked to brother russ dunker today and i told him it's a strange prayer that we would pray because you know we pray uh christmas we won't snow you know we like to have but we don't go out and pray for it that much but they do because where they're at they need a lot of snow and everything you know i mean just foot after foot after foot of snow just continually and they like the snow really just start and go all the way through the whole winter just about it because it makes everything grow better and stuff like that so i said well we'll pray that the lord will send you some snow now we don't know how many feet you're going to get because we're going to just pray for the lord to to do that so remember brother uh duncan and all he greets everybody in the name of the lord amen any other announcements or anything that we have okay father we thank you for this day in your grace we thank you for calvary thank you for loving us lord thank you for guiding us and keeping us and we pray that you would just be with each and every one of us remember all of the sick among us lord and different things father that come upon us and all but we ask you to just cover it through the blood and let everything be all right uh remember the little bride around the world all of the little parts of the bride everywhere and satan fighting on every hand trying to conquer us and all but we know that we're already victorious no matter what happens coming or going we are overcomers and we believe you we love you and we thank you have your way now bless each one remember brother homer lord and touch him deliver that and these others in jesus name amen and we'll just take the three i think about three scriptures generally revelation 3 14 and unto the angel of the church of the lady of sian's right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god amen now we've been on that for a while and we'll probably stay on it a while but uh just uh pray the lord would bless us um maybe i won't be like we've listened to the day we're brought around i'm talking about the lady said he had had him on the ice heap job and you know keep on but i guess that's that's one way of doing it but you know let's go to genesis 1 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the earth and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them now we jump on over maybe we'll get to here tonight but we'll see uh verse go to genesis 2 7 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living soul you may be seated lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now the thought that we've been having is the three stages of creation and trying to bring that out to get us a little better understanding of what's going on and life and stuff like that and we covered uh two services so far onto that and the last one was really a a corrective form not that we were wrong but uh to bring it out that the first stage of our creation we know the first stage of christ was god himself not that god created god you know or god created jesus and jesus created you know this that or the other the bible says all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made so there's there's just one creator there's not three creators we're not dealing with a a three-part creation or something you know we're dealing with a point of of just saying uh the phases or stages of creation should bring each one of us to a better understanding of where we're at and what we're doing and the first stage we covered it as i said a couple of messages on the basis that um god came into being not that he was created or somebody created who or what he came into being he he stepped down or began to do as the prophet said to her that human beings could comprehend him understand him in other words so he he just was coming into being and he is always being he didn't have to come into from he didn't have to be created because it always was you know and that was the point so we've been dealing with trying to keep it into that line to see uh the one true and living god is what we're dealing with you know and seeing how god unveiled himself down to mankind and and bringing it into being that man could see or understand god all right see then in doing that then uh we know that god was a spiritual if you want to talk about creations or whatever you want to use your terminologies about it that he was first spirit being god is a spirit see no man has seen god at any time because he is a spirit all right see then being that spirit he he is eternal and always was eternal you know and it's a spiritual being that you're talking about that was always existed and he existed alone all right and being alone then he was lonely and he wanted something to uh be like him and also then he creates and genesis 1 picks up and there you've got the genesis 1 26 man that he says let us make man in our image and our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish and the all right then now comes in the part that that's still part of now the first creation or the first phase i use terms and i'm sorry i don't have the education and if i say something it don't fit right you just race that out and put it over in another little pocket and and answer your own question you know because i just just try the best that i can what we see as i said now we see god is a spirit all right you can't see a spirit he never is doing that's what he's trying to do he's trying to come into being to where he can be comprehended are seen or understood so he begins to descend toward the human to what you know we would be and as he does see we see that he is a spiritual being all right so what would be the next part that would still be part of stage one of your creation would be adam as being in the image of god all right and having him to be what a spiritual being adams see in his first creation i say first creation because he had to be brought into being in spirit realm and then i hope we get far enough in tonight to understand that he came into being in a physical realm all right but now i want you to keep in mind because i really don't know how i'm going to be able to explain it but remember one thing that adam in a phil in a spiritual creation is in the image of god all right but then adam in a physical creation now physical you know tangible whatever you want to call it 16 elements etc is in a natural creation and that's actually a head of god because god follows adam now there's a scripture we'll get to in a minute that's always bothered me and and everything but it's all right i just try to express it but see the human body of jesus christ didn't come into being until 2000 years ago now the human body so then the human body of adam come into being 6 000 years ago but just get the point of what we're trying to do don't don't get confused just listen and then you uh you come and help me that's that's what i need i need help to express words and things but i believe that god will give us those words to do all right so now what was it god is a spirit okay then what did he create when he created adam a spirit man all right in his own image no spirit man so that he could rule in the garden and do the things but then it would be a while before he would come into being in genesis 2. that's what we've got to get that and keep it separated to where that we can understand where we're at all right so phase one as we've tried to cover that's back before the foundation of the world that was back before anything physically materialistically or or whatever you want to use the word came into being it was a spiritual creation all right god existed alone self-existing but then as he began to condescend downward he becomes more into the spirit realm and we read to you if you need these we've been over and over you should have them you've got them that uh god gave birth to his own son all right not that he gave birth to his son like a birth happened a birth means a coming forth into in other words what you've done when you were birthed see when you come into the world by birth by natural you come forth into a condition that you did not exist before that's right so you just stepped over in so that's what god is doing he's he's condescending to where that we can comprehend him because how could the human being comprehend the great eternal god so you can't do it you can't you can't do that part so he was trying to express himself and as he comes forth he comes forth in a spiritual being all right then see when adam comes forth in his first part or phase of the creation when he comes forth he doesn't come forth as a natural man you know physically uh 16 elements he came forth in a spiritual condition to be exactly like god all right so then when it says that god is a spirit man is a spirit not talking about that we're just spirits of this you're you don't get all this get what i'm talking about get the point that the spirit part of us is that soul that is within us thee all right and the scripture says and the last adam was made to live in soul all right see then we've got to get to that point and i don't want you to i don't want to confuse you but i don't want to leave it to where it can be confusing see because god has wanted to unveil himself he wants to reveal himself to his people and he wants people like himself all right so he wanted to to fellowship so it has to be done in stages so he felt he brings forth man in a spiritual condition adam and eve was made a living soul all right the prophet says blasphemous names that adam had eternal life in his soul all right so then eve would have eternal life in her soul so there would be your spiritual creation and that part came into being before the world ever come into being so you got the the spiritual creation of man and and he he is in a condition to where that he's exactly like god god didn't want dogs and cats and horses and things like that he can fellowship with him but now he wanted something like himself so he started with something like himself what kind of a person would he have been had he just created a flesh for adam there would have been no fellowship because he would still not be something like him so if the bible's true that says let us make man in our own image all right then if we're created in the image of god it is not this man that you're talking about this man will come into being in another stage as we go along you know because if it did you'd be in bad shape because you you got one little person one big person one fat person one skinny person that wouldn't be in the image of god i'm trying not to be too carnal but yet being carnal enough to wear the little donut on you all of us are different sizes and everything else but the natural man see is not in the image of god but the spiritual man which is the very soul the being the person that adam and eve was in genesis 1. all right making them in the image of god in his likeness now he has something to fellowship with right back in the garden i mean back before time ever begun now listen to the story because i'm just trying to to go as i can all right see man come into being before the foundation of the world spiritual man not physical man now no physical man never come into being until you get on over to genesis 2. we'll get to that but spiritual man in the image of god the likeness of god comes forth in before time ever begins and god has something to fellowship with all right now hold on to the point now he still is is not in his right to be state because there's other parts of him in attributes that has not been displayed when you're talking about the thing of man and let us make man and think that you're not in the natural creation you're not into those things so hold on to that back up just a little follow me as i go i i i notice i say that a lot you know because what i mean is just just simply try to stay with what i'm talking about don't say well i don't know where he's going he's going over here that's spiritual man that's that's just the man over here that man over there see you run out ahead and you get it all confused and then you blame me well i take my part because i'm confused to start with all right the point of doing is i'm trying to break us away from our confusion you know i'm trying to get us to where we can comprehend all right see there was god dwelling totally alone then he begins to condescend and as he does he comes into the part of making man in a spiritual condition or making an eternal person all right adam and his soul was eternal his body and his spirit was not but now follow that as we go along okay now then as it is adam and eve comes forth in this condition that they could exist before the world right are you following me their existence would be the same as god's existence spiritual being all right they could that's why they could rule the animals the natural man the the genesis there where it talks about that take care of the animals and rule the animals and the things will be under that that never was to be a natural thing that's a spiritual being that's a spiritual part that's a spirit if you've ever seen anybody that do it if you just look at the natural i saw i've told you about it about brother tatum that time that that dog was and and that dog was so mean to uh you know i i i knew that you couldn't trust him so i told my wife and then i said y'all go around behind the truck and the old dog was up in the truck and boy he was old german shepherd he was raising kane and you know and i i was gonna say oh i told him y'all going behind if he jumps i'll try my best to get him off of all of us or do whatever because we're going in the house and about that time brother tatum gets out of the truck or the car he comes walking up and he walks he says why blacky what are you doing just lay down and he just put his hand over and that dog then saw a man up in tennessee up there and he walked right up to a dog and that dog i would have never went within no feet of that dog but he just and he had to do it a couple of times because that dog went after him but in a minute he just walked up and he laid his hand on that dog the dog just laid right down he had met his master not a physical man get me not a physical man there was something else involved there was a spirit involved you know and it may have been just a natural spirit to start with but i've seen that happen it will work all right but now get the point see adam and eve in a spiritual creation back before time began amen all right and that spiritual condition then existed and that brings your your phase one into being to where that we're in the image of god see you are a spiritual creation by the baptism of the holy ghost when we get to that you'll see more what i'm talking about but we are in a spiritual condition by what that god has allowed us to have okay now see then knowing though that's to be true there was parts of god he still did not was not able to get into being uh there in the you know in the spiritual creation because it was not just a spiritual creation did he come to bring it was a spiritual creation in a natural condition how else would you say it because it would go to the natural flesh and the flesh then would would come to that point all right but see adam and eve now get my point they're in ex they're in a condition just not god is in a condition they're in a spiritual condition all right the physical hasn't come into being yet all right see then now watch the part of god's plan he knows right there that would be a wonderful place to stay would be the spiritual condition all right he knows that that would be wonderful but he knows that would not display all of his attributes so he could not bring forth any of the attributes into being he couldn't you know he couldn't do none of those things and it would leave him lonely again he would go back to the existence that we could exist with him and that'd be a wonderful thing but yet still it will not display the attributes because see you've got to go into stage two in creation to think about any form of attributes see all right so then when adam and eve come into being in a spiritual condition they were in the image of god are you with me okay now that would give them eternal life because their body had not come into being yet come on their body was not into being their spiritual part is that what we call the spirit of memory reason conscience etc and all that would not be in existence either so it would be the spiritual condition of the eternal life that god had given to adam and eve okay now a lot of people would argue with me maybe i shouldn't use it so emphasis isn't too much to illustrate but i believe whatever adam had eve had now because that's what your prophet said he said they were one in theophany so that settles that to me now you know but yet i know that people see they'll say well i go along now with adam because blasphemous names i just can't go along with these well i'm sorry uh i i'm one person that i want to be right and i believe it what i'm trying to say is right but see now you've got the spiritual condition you've got your spiritual creation bad words to use you've got your spiritual part of coming into being and now here's what we'll get back to it on predestination see when we get finished up we'll come back to predestination and go through because the prophet said if you wasn't back there before the foundation world you never will be now is that true do i need to bring all those quotes i will when i get to it see but it should be enough that you know that he said he said those things because if you wasn't back there you never will be back there it's not something that the new birth puts us back there no our spiritual being eternal life is just as eternal as he is so in that spiritual condition your soul was eternal the rest of you hadn't come into being yet amen now god is thinking well how do i get all of these other attributes into being now i've got my people i've got my children i've got my offspring in a spiritual condition that exists the same as i do but see now that people would pick up that thought too and they would want to do something else you following me any problem with thinking that if you have eternal life that if god gave you eternal life back before the world would there be any problem with that eternal life in you desiring to be made manifest just as well as it was in almighty god himself because see jesus wasn't in existence the flesh man at that time you you've got to wait until you come and that's what i'm saying you can't bring jesus into a physical condition until four thousand years from the time is it was the creation over to that and he would come into being but adam would start the human race wow to worry they could be attributes displayed jesus the flesh man didn't step out there the flesh man never stepped out there four thousand or six thousand years ago and uh he was a spiritual creation he could create all things were made by him and without in him was not anything made that was made all right what would be the problem then of trying to think about the condition or existence of a human being that eventually will come to the position that they can speak the word just like their father did do you have any trouble with that do you have any trouble with thinking about that you with eternal life you're a child of god if you have eternal life you're a child of god i know it it may be uh and i don't mean to the fact of some that you know hasn't heard a lot i'm saying to all of us have we heard enough of the prophet's message to be able to put it together or are we still like you know when i remember all of the things of predestination and and things that began to do and everybody say i always was eternal i always was eternal well no why are you getting old right if you always was eternal what happened got a problem there seems like it is to me because you know trying to bring this down into a situation to where we can comprehend that that eternal life that you have and i don't believe you come into the world with eternal life on the basis of the way the people of this message try to bring it i don't believe it that way now i believe you started before the world ever begun as a spiritual being and being a spiritual being would automatically make you eternal that's right i believe it that way but then there's things that's that's see when you come up so far you've got to stop and just think for a minute here's god coming and bringing himself in and showing himself and revealing himself into existence and now here's his children coming into existence sure if you have eternal life right amen now if you have eternal life today that eternal life that you have always was eternal right if god was eternal then he always was eternal he said yeah but you're making it a little bit too strong i told you years ago i said one of these days i'll preach to you what i see on predestination well i'm gaining ground i'm getting up to at least a few places that i can see things put together because see i believe if you have eternal life that that eternal life is just as eternal as god's own life because that's whose life it is it is god's own life imparted into you but just don't let them impart it into us too quick don't bring it into us as sinners and let us remind sinners in some kind of an eternal condition because you can't do that that's why when as i'm trying to get to it there god existed alone but yet he had attributes in him now those attributes are getting an opportunity to be able to be displayed and the first attribute to be displayed would be the spiritual man the eternal life that he has it's the first existence all right and see then doing that now you've got to a spot so i'm going to try to move now see adam then steps forth what would be the wording the man adam comes into being the flesh man adam according to genesis 2 right genesis 2 you've got a natural creation true all right see this is one you've got a spiritual creation so now you have the natural creation bring it into being of adam before jesus ever comes into being in a natural condition why you don't think why why would it be that adam looked like jesus would have to come into being i'm talking about flesh no because it would not bring forth the attributes see then adam would step forth in genesis 2 as a natural man now your attributes can be displayed he has to grow he has to to bring forth and and and bring into being but as he does then he'll come to the basis that adam becomes a living soul a human being because get what i'm saying now and listen without adam coming in as the human being first you could not have your attributes displayed you couldn't do that you got to let him come first you got to bring in a natural creation and that's what the scripture says first corinthians 15 46 and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit now which came first albeit that was not first which is spiritual yet we know it was first but the physical man has to come first spiritual man is part of god but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord of glory adam was not the second man jesus christ was the second man the lord of glory adam was the night first natural man now follow me he was made that away to where the attributes could be displayed there would be a capability of the fall with adam coming physically before jesus had jesus come physically first there would have been no fall right don't put no lustful thing in the lord jesus but things can happen in adam there adam was a spiritual being in eternal life in his soul but then god created him a body what'd the prophet say he put the genesis 1 man into the genesis 2 man right he put him in there and as he did now you have adam on the earth with eternal life in his soul but he's not got it in his body right adam doesn't have eternal life in his body see because that's that would do away with the condition or existence of the fact that man could fall had jesus come first man couldn't have fallen i'm physically saying it now physically if jesus physically had come first there would have been no ability for a fall to taken place but by bringing adam into existence and making him a natural man not eternal life in his body not eternal life in his spirit part of him of memory reason consequence with eternal life in his soul it's no problem with me i don't know where it would be with you or not and see then the things can start transpiring the fallen condition can come into existence because you have the ability with adam to fall there's no ability of jesus christ to fall but adam could fall and did fall he became a living soul right genesis 1. he had eternal life in his soul but that wasn't in physical being to where the fall could come so then you have to put the man into the genesis 2 man you put that spiritual man over in you don't do away with his eternal life in his soul you don't have to yes but brother dale if you have eternal life you can't fall you can't fall and go to hell but you can sore stoma a whole lot right don't think just because you have eternal life that you can go out and live like the devil now don't talk to me on language that way i ain't talking to you don't talk to me and say well brother dale i can't sin because i'm born again i got what the prophet said there go ahead but just come on back with it the way it's supposed to be what are you understanding i'm trying to do two things one thing bring eternal life into being but on the other hand showing that that eternal life can step into a human body and that body can come forth and display the attributes of almighty god huh adam then was the first physical man jesus was the first spiritual man why because he condescended into the world that's why the bible says that adam was formed but it don't say that of jesus see jesus actually went through a birth he went through a birth see he was begotten amen adam was created brother around and said right from the hand of almighty god adam was created but jesus wasn't created like that he was begotten he just went from one existence to another to another existence and kept coming until he become human right and that took 4 000 years that took the prophets with the word and the thing to bring that to where that jesus could be the word made flesh the son of man all right so now you're following me phase one we're still in it that that was in phase one which was before the foundation of the world now is moving over closer into the coming into natural being so you take adam from genesis 1 with eternal life in his soul you put a body then in genesis 2 put that genesis 1 into genesis 2. now you've got a human being but don't ever think that you've got a human being that can't fall now you can't fall and be lost we do not believe in that you can't have eternal life and lose it are you with me you can't have eternal life and lose it but you can't have eternal life and live like the devil they don't don't try to go that way and say well you know that that means that i i'm eternal and and i can't fall no i agree with you if you have eternal life today you can't fall from eternal life where would you fall to but if you have eternal life you don't want to fall why would you want to fall what would be your your thoughts why would you even have human thoughts in your mind to think well it don't matter what i do i'm a christian it doesn't matter what you do because you can prove what you are about what we do all right so right now we are with our phase one brings the eternal soul of an eternal being into existence and then genesis 2 you put that into the flesh and there's the flesh man adam now adam can go out with the animals and things and it'd be close but still it's not the natural atom that's going out there with the animals and controlling it right it's the spiritual atom that's in with inside adam then would be made a living soul a person with eternal life all right now you've got an ability though for the man to fall so now you're coming with your attributes are you with me now you've got your you're coming to the basis that you can have attributes come into being in other words god can come down and fellowship with the mankind but yet he can't fellowship no further than the fact of being knowing that he's a human being but he can be a savior he can be a healer he can be all of those things through the attributes that have been displayed not by adam no adam made the way that the things you know god to use adam to make the way for things to take place now you've got your attributes of mine now you've got a flesh man and then that odd to think about that you've got a flesh man the flesh man adam come before the flesh man jesus that's what i'm saying that's hard to express but you've got to have if you've got any sense at all you know it's the truth because you read your bible come on read your bible the first man adam was made a living soul eternal life within his soul the second adam is the lord of glory adam is not the second adam you don't do that you have the first adam and the basis of what he is to do but the second adam is the lord jesus christ but now you have the ability to fall well i never thought of it like that would you explain it to me then well i don't believe adam and eve had eternal life well they didn't anyhow know where to fall from see did you understand the point if adam and eve didn't have eternal life how could they fall you can't fall if you ain't got it you can't fall off a roof until you get up there and see you can't fall from eternal life to go to hell because god made the way because that's part of his attribute and he left out that attribute as savior then you would have the ability to fall and go to hell but he didn't he's got all of these attributes amen savior healer alfred amiga rosa sharon all of that you've got all of the things that he has the ability to display those things and it took him 4 000 years think about that from the time of adam in the garden and all until the birth of a baby named jesus christ but you see look at adam follow my point now eternal life and soul but not in body and spirit when the lord jesus christ stepped upon this earth he was in exactly the same condition he turned alive in his soul but his body and spirit was not eternal because now the displaying of the attributes come into being that he can die just as i said don't think you can't fall just think of the being the fall being in the right order you can't fall and lose eternal life no but you can be cut short but the lord jesus when he came he couldn't fall no way all right and see then when he was made a child think about it see we're up on stage two stage two and now is god to come into human flesh god coming into human flesh was not the uh how can i say this now come on by adam and eve coming the way they did in the fall that we've been through then you can see that there is a fallen condition that can exist i hope you understand that you can see that mankind did fall adam and eve fell but they didn't fall to death well i got where the prophet said he felt that adam fell from eternal life where did he fall to that's all i'm asking you i'm not arguing with you where did he fall to adam had the capability of falling physically and he did physically but he never died spiritually right see but when jesus came upon the earth he became the second adam to be able to take the place of the mankind that had fallen or to display his attributes now you're coming to phase two that we're trying to get see then adam listen jesus was begotten adam was not begotten adam was created he said it's all the same no no it ain't jesus is the only begotten son we're sons by by uh uh adoption and things so listen to what your prophet is saying first creation is a spiritual creation of god and adam as the spiritual birth the second part is the lord of glory that comes into being to where that he can be into that and and god can look down and see what's taking place adam was his first created son taken from the message uh god's powers are transformed jesus was his only begotten he was begotten by a woman but adam was right straight from the hand of god in the creation so adam was created he created a physical body back there and stuck adam in it adam the spiritual man was put into the natural the lord jesus was begotten see from a woman all right come on let's go ahead and read just a little bit go to number five brothers we'll just pick up a short cut cut some of it anyway you know that we've done been through it god gave himself birth to his the son which was before there was even an adam he started to make another creation now let's go to number five he comes from the future home holy ghost descended upon the earth jesus was the beginning of the creation of god oh you see it god made in creation he was spirit the bible said he is the beginning of the creation of god how did he begin in the wounds of a woman which is what the woman is and that's what i told you when i come through that i like that wounds natural wound but a spiritual wound eve had a natural wound for a natural child but she had a spiritual wound for the word of god so then you've got the wounds and the wounds of a woman like how them blind people can't see the serpent's seat right here the eve was put here on the earth and before satan ever touched her or anything else god said to them multiply and replenish the earth that's right but satan comes in here and if that was adam's son then word adam was a direct descendant from god and you can only take the nature of your parents and when you get born again you take the nature of your parents all right are you following me then what happens go to number six okay jesus christ is the beginning of the creation of god revelation 1 is that right then when when was god created he is the beginning of the creation of god and god is eternal is that right but when god was created now listen when a little baby that was conceived in the wound of a mother a virgin and she began to develop those cells within her to bring forth this little baby that was the beginning of god's creation right for god was made flesh and dwelt among us and become emmanuel god with us the beginning of the creation of god do you understand when he came into being it was through the wound of a woman now follow back adam was created are you with me god created adam god formed jesus through the birth the birth had to bring forth why because he's going to have to display his attributes you can't display the attributes without it being him being god himself in human flesh god adam was his son a created son creative son but jesus was his only was his begotten son and god was in jesus reconciling the world unto himself are you with me now adam was created let us make man he made him but jesus wasn't formed he was birthed mary gave birth to the lord jesus christ why because that would bring forth all your attributes now you've got everything in order when that baby was on this earth he was emmanuel right yet he couldn't die for your sins he was 10 years old he couldn't die for your sins when he was over there with discussing the bible with the pharisees and he couldn't die for your sins when he become 30 years of becoming 30 he had to reach to that point that he could be a creative be a savior see now you've got the creator back in the way he's wanted to be as begotten the only begotten of the father he was the only one that had begotten that way now the rest of us has begotten that away he was begotten that away that was his way of coming you know i didn't cut it we come by natural mom and daddy right you say well you just said that they should come forth in the wound of a mother yeah but that was without sex right that was without sin see don't put him as a sinner now leave him to be what he's supposed to be a creator a savior all of those things yeah but don't make him a sinner see god come forth into human flesh to become our savior and as he did adam could not die for my sins there's no way adam could die for your sins it wouldn't work out but the great creator could die but it would take him then 30 something years after coming into the world becoming 30 the bible says that's why you can figure out the three and a half and the different things and it'll come out to be perfectly right because jesus was becoming 30. not to be 30 to be a minister you had to be becoming 30 in other words on your way he was 29 and a half and that makes it the worst jesus could preach three and a half years and then preach three and a half years and it come out now the ministry and be in the correct correct order just put in a little point but are you following me so he was that second stage of creation was the bringing into order first the man adam put it with the ability to sin put him in a condition that he could sin do wrong but yet he would never be lost god didn't curse adam god didn't curse eve god cursed the ground he couldn't he couldn't he cursed that beast and that but he didn't curse the human race that's where we're wrong thinking we did no but when that baby come into the world there come your savior there was god in human flesh adam was not god in human flesh adam was adam in human flesh a son of god a child of god but jesus was god almighty in human flesh right the only begotten the only begotten what about it he started a new race you've got the easy of supposed to read them he started a new race in in adam because he brought forth a natural person a new race new creation new race but all that got wiped out in the ability to portray it or do it by the fall and the conditions and was all made to be right but here comes jesus christ the beginning of the creation of god god steps down into human flesh through the wound of a woman to be able to take away the sin of mankind to be able to display his attributes and make man make it come forth into the correct order and he started a new race now jesus started a new race adam just started race jesus started a new race a new creation a creation of himself as the way he wanted it right as before the world ever begun that he wanted it now he's not lonely anymore because now he's coming to the poor to where he can really display what he has need of so do you understand phase one and phase two maybe that maybe it's not enough i'll i'll pray and see if we'll go back over and i'll go back over because i don't don't bother me you know i just keep preaching until i get satisfied or either confuse you enough to make you where you'll study because that's one point but listen a new creation you can't depend upon adam even though he had eternal life and soul even though he was a child of god in the physical points of of being you know uh different than uh the rest of the people around right you agree with that i mean he he was a a child of god yeah and he was but he wasn't physically made any different but yet he was in the bases that god could deal with adam right god can deal with you by the new birth that's right all right see but to come forth in a new creation now naturally speaking adam was the beginning of a group of people but spiritually speaking jesus christ was the beginning of the creation of god god coming down into human flesh all right now but that don't end the story i don't know how to approach this part right here so i'll do the best i can it's part of the story that we're not understanding not understanding childhood we're not understanding how we are the children of god now that we're the offspring of almighty god by imparting eternal life into your soul he has made you now listen he has made you back like adam was before the fall he has given you eternal life in your soul you can never lose that you have eternal life huh but that's not all of the race see now adam was doing fine but it's not said of adam that he was a new creation a new race we know it was because god chose it to be that way but what about a church what about a group of people okay go to number 13 let's read this and then we'll quit i want to read this whole thing the number 13 if you will you'll see that i jumped around a lot on this and you understand i jumped around and listened to what your prophet had to say from the ladies in church age of church age book but now he's standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of god this is another creation now watch this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself now this is himself coming into being the way he wanted it i want to put that right there what i'm reading this about is to get you to see god wanted his what how did brother uh right around and said god had his church the way he started the church the way he started it and he wanted it the way he finished who who's the statement my brother uh henry greene was the one that made it that god started his church the way he wanted it and he wanted that church back again that's the point i can't get the exact wording but listen he says this is a special designation of himself who is he he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as the spirit of god he came down in the virgin mary the cells come down and created in the virgin mary the cells from which his body was born i want to repeat that he created the very sales in the wound of mary for that body now remember how that we were in the message last week that that jesus christ that body it's how do you say it the the body of almighty god was not something that he took material and put it together now i'm trying to get a point across so listen it was spoken into existence it was not something that he built it up and see he didn't do that with with uh you know a natural baby but he spoke it into existence now that's what i'm trying to get you to see here the bride of jesus christ is the very word of god spoken into existence okay so now listen it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to a human over him supplied by mary that would have been sinful mankind produced in a body that would not have produced the last adam of whom it was said lower body thou hast thou father prepared for me god not mary provided that body mary was the human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a it was a god man he was the son of god he was of the new creation man and god met and joined together he was the first of this new race he's the head of this new race who's he talking about the lord jesus christ all right and it comes forth there you see that though man was of the old order or creation now in union with christ he has become the new creation of god now he's become the new creation okay no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with israel he chose abraham and abraham's issue through the godly isaac line but now out of every kindred tribe and nation he has purposed a new creation he's the first of that creation he was god created in the form of man now by his spirit he is creating many sons unto himself god the creator created himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of god the true revelation of god is god and man becoming one god and man becoming one is the real true revelation of almighty god and he chose you he chose you to be his child he chose you to tell you this mystery of redemption he chose us to be that new creation you race new creation no longer dealing by the old ways don't deal by the new way which is the new man the christ jesus so then adam was created yeah but jesus was begotten now if he's the only begotten of the father who are we we are his offspring we're his children we're sons and daughters of a living god by the new birth that he has given to us eternal life making us part of that new race you realize what he's done for you and me stage one sure we'll get back to it if you wouldn't back there you never will be backed up stage two brings a physical man adam in the garden stage 3 brings it back the way god wanted it amen he wanted that whole creation before the foundation of the world to be part and he's making you and me to be part of that new creation that new race his offspring if he was the only begotten then we're begotten through him right we're begotten through jesus christ eternal life given into your soul waiting the redemption of the body i told my brother russ here today about it i said thing that i'm looking at right now is the change of the body the change of the body why because everything else is in order what i was talking about was the natural part that we were talking about that we now have the white house with the woman it's full of catholics so it can be either way that you want to use it as the natural church or if you want to use it as a natural woman as vice president you have that in order right now and there's no telling what's going to happen just like i told brother russ i said i've never been a doomsday i've never been down hmm this is the greatest hour there could ever be to thank that god made a new creation a new race and you are that new creation you are his offspring you're his children sons and daughters of a living god is god made manifest in another form called the bride this is a special designation read that in the church book of himself this has to do with the church the church is his bride you ever thought about a bride being more important than the children i'll get around to preach on that a little bit a bride cause you know what a bride is she's part of him she's part of him he said well my children are part of me you know but it took somebody else to help you don't take nobody else to be this just give your heart and soul to almighty god he said well brother dale i don't understand what you're saying tonight it's kind of like i know that's what i told you i'm thinking on these things but trying my best to get you to see who you are and what you're doing we're his offspring we're his children and we're him made manifest in another form called a bride or a church come on musician christ in you the hope of glory first man adam made a living soul second man was made the lord of glory or was the lord of glory amen i hope you followed me bringing adam down in the human race bringing jesus christ down into the human race and how that now he is imparting his own life into me and you giving us eternal life in our soul waiting the redemption of the body because that's our next stage all right think on these things let's stand what we got brother 103. you're all on the altar [Music] we pray [Music] the altar is laid is your all on the altar of sacrifices your heart does a spirit control you could only be blessed [Music] that by your stripes we're healed our sisters delivered from this condition and it's gone from her because you said it and we believe you we give her a prayer cloth this is a confirmation to believing it all as well we thank you in jesus name amen just go believe it how about it do you believe it to be free if you believe it then accept it and just say thank you [Music] thank you lord we're his children we're his offspring [Music] he was the only begotten sacrifice but you see the way he came if you're following me the way he came is the way we come he came by [Music] that's how we come in by birth he came into being by birth begotten that's the way we do we accept jesus christ as our savior [Music] anybody have a need [Music] is [Music] your heart [Music] see the only difference in you and god now listen the only difference in you and god [Music] his body has already been made eternal we're waiting the redemption of our bodies [Music] that's the difference [Music] well i don't know but that's the difference somebody's going to receive it and speak it and it's going to work the altar is the amenity just remember to pray for wade for the weekend and that the lord would bless us be we pray that brother homer will be all right everything be taken care of there and all of these that are sick just pray that god will reach down and touch make the little bride cause we don't have to we don't have to let satan push us around we can stand up and fight and say by his stripes i'm healed father we thank you and we just ask you to go with us now as we go our natural ways and we pray that what we said lord will dwell in our hearts and father we pray that you would just open our understanding to thy love and our grace and all we
