========================================

all right what I asked what would never start taking online reservations dollar charge if you come in today this is where you see it what if they don't come then they get charged but they get charged still get final no Magnum seats we used to sitting down hollyhocks good well brother I'm not in it last yeah yeah they're horrible the other horrible they're not good we're long I know that's why shouldn't say it was we're getting to be back in the house a little more good to be back in the saddle we are we are going to by the guidance of the Lord we're going to start through the book of Romans so just Bible study we might bring in someone what the prophets in I apologize that my hook her up her thing don't hook her up to menu iPad that Anderson and then bought me but Richards on the phone now ordered me an adapter so we'll have it on the screen next thing and we will be able to look at some of these words out because I want to look I've been looking through the Bible and looking at the commentaries of what other people wrote which is fine you can do that and we may bring in some other translations or really not interpretations but you know read a little bit more where we can understand it but the book of Romans is a issue the longest book to Paul wrote so he really spent a long time writing because I'm gonna give you a little history because the Roman it makes you understand see I understood better what I was reading even when I was I would go to I think it's a Bible talk or the guy has a real good eye he he doesn't give any doctrine he just gives you what Paul did where he was that when he did it cuz really Paul had never been to Rome when he wrote for the Romans he was incorrect he within contrast when he wrote this letter mmm so he had not made it to Rome yet but he knew there was people in Rome that was Christians so he was talking to him and he was getting ready to go wrong now so he's never been there before so he's talking to these people that are in Rome from Corinthians so you're going to see a little bit of Corrections mixed in because remember Corinthians is one book of Correction the Corinthians were I mean let's just be plain we had a guy sleeping with his mother-in-law and with his stepmom and we're not sleeping but got married and they all kind of messed up stuff from Paul gothic and even in Corinthians that he were original couple of Sundays Oh liars you know transgressors and all that he had a big list he's successful some of you well he had a minute congregation so what he done was is he least sent us a message what he done he is is he took and wrote these letters to the Romans and send them to him before he come so this guy will have a good commentary because I want you to look at go to you Bible women now if you've got a Scofield Bible you can read this footnote but that's okay we won't do it today but it's real strange that the Lord brought us into the book of Romans because the book of Romans is in three parts chapter one through chapter middle chapter 5 Paul is speaking of justification it ties in pretty good with what we're doing upstairs in chapter 5 12 through chapter 8 39 deals with sanctification and then 9 through 11 deals with the children of Israel are then being reborn really the book of Romans now as we read this book of Romans remember what Paul did Paul went to the Old Testament and got the revelation to write all of his books one of the commentators said this is the way it was positioned because it's not the first epistle it's about the fourth or fifth or maybe even six but it's in the order in the Bible right after the book of Acts is the first book so right after the book of Acts here comes the book of Romans so the book of Romans is an exposition of the Old Testament so Paul what he's doing is he's cooking the old taking the Old Testament brought it in and in his letters because remember these are the physical letters that Paul writes to people okay he wrote letters like putting the mailings into but once they picked it up and read it the inspiration of God said that's going into the Bible that's how all this come come to being is is they were letters written palm down right next to me and you but it's absolutely the Eternal Word of God so it is does alright but that book of Romans is a total exposition of the Old Testament so as we go through this you need to keep this in your mind because what helps me more than anything I never liked somebody to tell me well this is just the way it is I can't stand that so I left home I don't like somebody said this is the way it is well what well I should I know there's something behind this so that's the same way with the book of Romans their book aramas yes the Bible yeah but there's something behind this book that we by the inspiration of the Lord should understand not just well this is Romans 1 remember because remember there was no chapters right God had the scribes into whatever 14th century or whenever it was had them put these chapters because you watch Paul Paul takes a thought and he continues right on and you would think hey we don't need footage after - it's just a continuation because that Larry never had chapter it was a full rhythm and this was the longest letter that Paul wrote of gospel says you're in way over here Romans like 16 so this is the longest book he wrote the longest letter that he wrote to the people and it's just it's a wonderful book I'm glad they put it right after the book of Acts though the Holy Ghost fell now you see the book of Romans were where Paul has taken the Old Testament and bringing it into the new he did that same thing with the book of Hebrews but I want us to understand now as we recall what he is writing remember the Holy Ghost wrote this one Paul but that was Paul Paul wrote it in Polish and that he it begins here at Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of God so he knew he was a separated person he's telling you he wrote this but he's writing this to you and I and the generation that's one level about the Word of God you know it doesn't matter the the world continues on 10 more years 20 more years this is still going to be coming to that generation of people so to me that that's to me that's the onion peel the layers that you just keep pulling a little thin layers back and you can see into the Word of God so let's read this now and go verse by verse and like I said not you so much let's look at this to apply to our life when we get into the book of Hebrews brother branham's mentioned Romans a good bit but he really you know remember he he went into the chapter of Hebrews and did a series on so we'll use a little of that but I want us to see it I want us to be able to see these things okay I want us to be able to know why God wrote the book of Romans to me and you not to the Romans not to call but to me because I always go back to that quote brother Brown says faced final resting places in the Word of God if you can't take it back and look at it in the Bible because remember even blessing Martin Luther Martin Luther love the book Romans if you'll read his writings I read them a little bit last night or yesterday the book of Romans Martin Luther loved the book of Romans and you're going to find that why because the just shall live by faith Paul uses several times in this in this chapter so Martin Luther really loved the book of Romans and I haven't read his commentary yet but he does have a commentary on the book of Romans and I'm gonna read it and just show that you know this is not just you got to look at the Bible and that's why I'm with the seals that become a brand-new book because you look at the Bible and you look on the surface and you see God's talking to you but now God's not talking to you just in baby form justification he has got a higher form of justification and then I like what brother Ernie says a true revelation of justification that's for the part of you that didn't do it that's where everybody's the problem with the people is it's remember brother Brown said you can't misplace the word of God okay can't-miss place you put it in its wrong place so what people are doing now even in the message oh I always was eternal that come with this eternal seat just wait a minute that will be revealed to you later but you can't take away I was thinking yesterday I worked in the bee yard from like 9 o'clock to 8 o'clock last night and had a lot of time thing but you can't take you take this like the book of Romans and you look at it and you read it but remember Martin Luther rated - he read it with Martin Luther's revelation right wet John Wesley obviously read the book of Romans in the sanctification party is but now as we have the sales opened up we see a true revelation and justification I always want eternal I was I was in the mind of God actually I was this okay then I became the word made flesh when I got born again I was made flesh from mom and daddy human flesh carne like the president was saying the other night meat that's in in Spanish carne is made and that's what he was saying she would just mean that this is all this is in meat right alright but that one from the eternal was in the Word of God you were in the Word of God listen God had Paul write this because you were gonna be here God had Matthew right there so you could be in there John forgot so loved the world he gave me only begotten Son who never believed in him shall not perish but have eternal life and that was written for everybody this born again they put their name in that one scripture I think okay so that's the way we're going to read this book of Romans I want you to read it and and remember one thing that's what I think that's what I can't get about these people you cuz you you remember what you used to do yes right we remember the things we used to do they work darling right so I can't take away salvation you gotta leave salvation where it is this whole book is a book of redemption which redemption I was thinking last night Redemption means something that lost you did something got lost you got lost so you were in a lost condition yes right now because you were in the mind of God you could be reading that's the clover the ground only you know only the ones that are born again are even thought of in Redemption because redemption to me is is what we're standing here now heading toward to change the body that's full redemption in the Bible I'm sure you got baby for redemption where people were renamed they come to just vacation they died they waked a thousand years they come up with the judgment and they have to be judged by the words and they believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved alright alright but they see that's not good enough for us right we know better more light has my brother they'll say more like that bug that eat that thing down has been exposed we know who that bug is right but that life in them roots come up and then you and I earn we come to Wesley come through Luca Luca Wesley penticoff now here where the word is that that same one that was put in the ground is right at the end of the stalk now this is us worth not to shock we're that seed that's inside there all right so that's what we come to we can't look back and say we're to shoot right now we came from to shoot okay when I got born again I started as to shoes because I want to just do justification sanctification baptism all to go and then the quick you come to life because the life's in the sea the life's not a stock anymore it life's not enough you watch corn you take corn watch it grow gets real grain but when the ears come out stop dies first all right then all of a sudden the seed drives up and then you can plant it you don't plant stop stop dead don't plan to leave leave your bed the seeds once got laughing so that life came up through there went out into the lamb down to that acorn or whatever you want to call it and the lobster night corn it's not even Leon's not in the tree for that acorn you understand one always dies so that's what we're at now we're not we're not doing away you can't just you can't just all of a sudden won't carry I'm turn and see a an ear of corn laying on the ground he just popped up by the ground no it's got to come through two shoes then the stock in the tassel within the corn all right you don't just walk up there and plant one city you can walk out there and you start seeing here's the corn later on the ground no I think to live but anyway it's same way with the Word of God it doesn't start where you just get everything dump don't get one done yes man right it comes in layers it comes in layers but you know what you got to believe every layer this way yes I mean I've said before you know we are believing something that we don't know happen that's right did you know Jesus died do you know he rose do you know I mean did you go physically witness that no you have to have faith that that's what happened and that's why I'm telling you that because you got to read Romans and have faith causes health faith faith faith faith one coach technically Paul didn't see Jesus die thank Lee never saw Jesus raised from the day right he had to meet God it's like I said before I I want to ask these people that says that you know we have these eternal seed in us Paul couldn't be persecuted see if he will see at that time a man okay Brian persecute Brian Christians can't persecute Christians and he calls him to blaspheme and it's written in the word so we don't have to we don't have to get a well maybe he said no he wrote that he did he calls him the black thing he held a code of the Pharisees when Stephen was stoned amen well Paul had a purpose Paul had a seed of representation but that Holy Ghost wasn't inside of him right and I want to ask these people to well I'm going while I'm on my soapbox there I'm going to I want to know where if you always was and you just come to this realization what about justification what about sanctification what does the Holy Ghost do well I want to understand because brother I'll always give the three steps so see I'm just going to be ignorant enough to that okay then they're preaching eager to that and come back to this I know that Paul preached justification sanctification baptism Peter preached jessica's if each person preached justice that can hold up so as long as we stay their name brother Brown like said on future home back to the Single Double he said I talked to three processes the grace I don't see reading fit three processes grace in if you just woke up one day and see it's just like I said about the what they were saying is is one day you just woke up out in the field and you worry record laying on the ground no tissue stopped I sold corn to shoot it's like Daddy said that's thinking when he said that doesn't matter who's on this earth at this moment right today doesn't matter rich poor young old doesn't matter we all were birth the same way naturally naturally we all were birth the same way we came from an act from a mama and a daddy you know the rest of the story so there's no difference in us as human beings so that's the same way with a new birth when you get the new birth it's got to be the same evening it's gotta be the same sure you may have a reaction me most I'm talking about though you gotta go to justification sanctification burn out that old nature and put god's nature in now to me that fits the bible from like the old man says from keyword akira right and even the killer is holy all right that's what he said you know it's right I just I I just won't if you'll go through that though cuz you know what happens you watch this because we're gonna see it in Romans you watch the hey Teddy and how minded people that said I always was he turning they jumped way over here they are they leave the message they going to fall sir dog more false doctrine they have affairs there's a lot of things happen to these people that preach this I was this great seed when I was born my baby you know I didn't need all this other stuff but if you'll stay right here and simple justification sanctification about didn't hold of you will you know why because God can't go against his word that's right so if he does you can stand there and call him a liar the thing but see they came they can do that because they're gonna realize one day - hey I should went to justification okay right but if we go through those three processes you cannot go wrong so Paul right here after the book of Acts with the Holy Ghost falling on the day of Pentecost through the book of Acts here's Paul working all right you got that Paul's working even in - it's since 1862 but the book of Romans had written in 86 T so he rode it during the commentary of the book of Acts because the Holy Ghost fell when the Holy Ghost fell the Holy Ghost fell Paul didn't say Lord who art thou but wait a minute I've always been he come no he said throughout our Lord he said I'm Jesus who you persecuted this was in them Christian people and Paul had to go find somebody that had the Holy Ghost right don't lay hands on him you get to hold a gun man I just want to I want to I just don't understand I want to stay with the simplicity of the extreme works of grace even we see them in the higher form of the seals that is still the same justified freely and then I show the rider of the Apostles Paul we got to get this commentator then we're gonna read just a few a few verses that alright I want you to pray that God speak to you through these through the scripture yes I I want to change my thought process here I told you that if I ever let's put somewhere in and couldn't get anything one book I always said it would be the future home right I disagree give me the Bible give me the bottle give me the Bob I know that's that's good but giving about collisions word of God from giver to hear it and I can sit and read it and we ought to be able to preach and not say brother Brown said because you know what he has is though what he brought was is a knowledge let me put it this way he brought a perfect understanding of the Bible so we don't question right what's going on like other commentators we we God spoke through him to us God spoke directly through him just like a four inch conduit pipe just click on the inside buddy come right into brother Robert right out his mouth and it fell on a bunch of believers but now what we got to do is we can't be Mockingbird that's right we can't be monkey murdered well I heard a preacher one time telling me he was brought he was a Mockingbird for brother around I said okay buddy and by the way he preached that's pretty much exactly correct would you die get it for you style parody yes okay yes it is parrot parrot yeah I can't do it nope he gives you a voice he give you understanding no we had to listen to the voice no doubt but God is gonna always speak to you through the work now if we have a question in the word he sent us a prophet to bring it and line it by her so that's what he did with Paul Paul went to the Old Testament remember you got to look at them and I'm just gonna give you a basis for this you got to remember put yourself I like to put myself in the day that these people wrote this because you got to remember same way with brother Branham when he first started his ministry he had bad it's Methodist Pentecostal terian he has a just class scope of denomination sitting and he had to preach to each one of them so I said one time listen stand up and address the third personal Trinity we what addressing his third person he was addressing their third person right right he couldn't be saying let's address the third person of the Trinity and him never been friends very never in his life right so he was preaching to them just like Paul I watched a movie about Paul's long time ago and they did a real good job but I want to watch this new one and see if he does the same thing but Paul remember he was a Jew but he was a scholar and he knew how to handle people when he went in and walked in the car around he didn't have a baseball back and start knocking their idols down the movie shows Paul walking into into the city of Corinth and they've got their idols and well Paul starts playing with the kids he's on the playground the kids her plan he's playing he plays a little rock games and he started doing that then he starts talking to the Perry a lot better you can get you can get more out of honey you know you catch more honey than you can with with vinegar so he walks in and he gets comfortable because remember the Corinthian people they were Idol worshipers they were whoremongers they did what they wanted to do so Paul didn't come in and start knocking stuff over he started playing with kids and you see him you know he'd sit down talk to the parents you know for the kind of ease his way in same way where the Romans could remember when we start reading this you got to remember the book of Romans where is the seat of Satan you shall know what's in the end time well it started back there so Paul is going into a group of people that still is living under the Old Testament yeah Old Testament Scrolls they live by that Torah they live by the prophets they live by this now he sees a conversion because remember the book of Acts started on what 80 30 there the Pentecost so for 60 years now you got a discount Paul persecuted persecuting the people for one thing for several years he persecuted the Christians then he became a convert so you got eighty sixty when he wrote this he's like 30 years in them in his walk with God so he's but he still looking at these Jews because he's going to cover circumcision uncircumcision he's gonna cover clean idols and you know he's gonna cover all day he's gonna cover the Holy of Holies he's gonna cover the sacrifices so once he covers that you got to remember you said well we don't do that anymore you know we got idols and all that stuff please please we just don't have them please don't have them like they have them when they send them up pray to them no no we have all of our different items that we help they take up our time because an idol worshiper something to worship and an item it's set before you know that's why we have to have faith in something we don't sing we got to have faith right most people and you'll see I think maybe in Paul in Romans or Hebrews he talks about things not made from the earth and right and all that stuff so let's just read a few verses here tackle one so Paul is speaking now from car ant to the Romans and remember this is going to be sectioned off from Romans one that we're going to read now into Romans five so maybe you can read Romans one through five that is speaking of justification and even you can pick it up in your Schofield Schofield even over on rent Romans 5:12 speaks of sanctification so we'll get into that and I like to read the other commentaries I don't like to just you know take one program did he read all kinds of of commentaries from different people but see if I have a question I know I don't go to DOM sooner but nothing against those men but I don't go to them because they're not vindicated to me I didn't say the one vindicated there not been kid to me the property guard indicated to me so I go back to and listen to what he said and what he said you still gotta run through your filter goes remember he's speaking to worldwide group but now remember see God starts whittling this away that's why in 1963 he says I call you bride he starts talking to the bride he don't talk to the denomination so he said he saw that they were doing even though he preached to me even though he went to a man had all kind of brotherly love he'd go preach them people and knowing that hated him but just because game or are or whatever that other guy's name is the Christian businessmen guy they hated brother Ram ulis and many people tell you they didn't like him but because of car wheels just because brother Williams having someone's influence he'd get brother brown man to preach them glass who he's preaching to them 300 preachers in Chicago it was a men sterile Association through the Christian businessmen he spoke to him and 300 of them didn't believe a word he say it right right cuz it ain't the Lord said they're gonna challenge you on that you know right so so what'd you win anyway same way were Paul Paul you'll see Paul get stoned never lay him down for them all the way uh a bigger kind of ledge to get out of a city one time right cuz one you know he was going against their religion so all right chapter 1 Paul a servant of Jesus Christ so he's positioning himself alright called to be an apostle that's my question are you called you called to do something alright I know many a call if you're chosen but if you have a calling you need to use that call it because Paul's using theirs right what separated unto the gospel of God now remember the gospel had been robbed yet they went a stitch a Bible written in 80/60 he was riding this way look was riding it yes they were riding it at the moment so the gospel of God wasn't a written piece of parchment the gospel was power demonstration of the Holy Ghost through people right I mean people pay attention you have a Internet to go back own or go back listen could you cliff do half of the service you know you know they've got what they got sitting there listening to a preacher and you know I don't think they had tablets or anything new they have to remember coming was a power God in salvation they knew had changed them alright now I want you to watch this now let's watch this one thing brother they'll brought this down a long time ago look at this watch Paul's writing it's a word called interpolate or interpolating interpolating interpolating is not that his interpreting what he's doing is every time you see parentheses look to chapter verse 2 what he's doing is is he makes a statement Paul makes a statement then he's going to not interpret what he said but he's going to add a little more so you can understand what did you say their way okay with that everything you look in parentheses what happened there is Paul is writing watch Paul's sermon let me read it like it should be oh well let me read it like without the princi excuse me Paul sermon Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separate into the gospel of God concerning his son Jesus Christ our Lord which was made the seed of David see you can miss something right there the interpolates in verse 2 see the parentheses yes what now let's really like said Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separated of the gospel of God that's a comma now he's going to tell you why he just said what he did which he had promised afore by his prophets in the Holy Scripture goes back to the Old Testament got that so the gospel of God he's talking about sure it's the gospel is preached but Paul saying my foundation is what the apostles and prophets spoke that's why he's interpolating he's telling you it's not just the gospel of God it's the gospel of God which he had promised afore by his prophets and that is because Scofield Bible that by his interpreted it's true which he had promised a form through his prophets in the Holy Scripture all right so that's the Old Testament of the Holy Scripture were even was not written at that time all right see there's a comma that sees you see that commas not period so he didn't finish the thought he's continuing the thought and you watch Paul we'll go through here in a minute he might go for verses and it being princely but what he did when he done what he's telling you he's explaining why he said what he said and it makes it more plain to us you know what I believe I believe Paul's writing this and God said you better say this right here to get the people to understand better you better save this right here okay all right Paul sorry Jesus Christ called me an apostle separated unto the gospel of gun which he had promised afore by his prophets in the Holy Scripture all right concerning his son Jesus Christ now that's the whole Old Testaments full of Jesus Christ the prophets are telling us that Jesus Christ is coming right yes which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh now remember he had no fleshly part but when God was in the Old Testament he had to deal with flesh right the Bible that come he couldn't get into the soul of man he dealt through the flesh of man you got it slice when he's saying he said concerning his son Jesus Christ our Lord which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh but when he told David under inspiration by the prophets he said David in other words this is going to come from your lineage because I really love you David so I'm gonna have a son when Solomon at the time but you see you gotta have your hairdo meaning right his son was Solomon and a very good job until the very end of his life right right let's see that's why I didn't you people don't ask them I see if someone would add Holy Ghost in his soul he'd never let two women turn him into idolatry right David wouldn't him Uriah killed for Bathsheba you see what I'm saying something there's the flesh part in the Old Testament you got to keep that look if God couldn't give an assault turn the man right cause the blood of bulls and goats covered what he did yes sure they were justified they were they weren't you know God didn't see it which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh now that is from David not to Solomon but from David's rust because he said David you'll always have this one on the front so it had to be a natural vintage and you can read in Luke wait is it Luke and Matthew I believe look at the landing it brings it right down to the cry Jesus Christ they're minutes okay but remember ahead stop at Joseph in the reality farm because Joseph had no see I mean Jesus had no single Joseph okay but according to the flesh think now look here we are again we may not ever get through this chapter but that's okay you look at Paul Paul is speaking to a group of people and he's telling them look the Old Testament was a fleshly thing does he don't the law now what he's gonna do you watch him in Romans though a little bit further down he starts bringing them through the law brings them right back out to grace see Paul II just start blessed on this is where it is and you're gonna have to bleep know he's he's I know you don't know the old text unless what he's saying to this group of people I know you don't know the Old Testament right right okay and the Old Testament was a fleshly lineage but now I'm fixing to later on and I'm gonna give you will read it north one cuz what just right here for four he's according to the flesh you got all this coming down to Jesus now Paul knows for a no shadow of a doubt that Jesus was not born Joseph are no human lineage it's a problem Paul knows Jesus was virgin born God produced a chemist and this journal right but he says right here he's talking to that group of people said look now according to the flesh David's going to have a sign that'll be on the throne because remember Christ didn't come here to sit on the throne of David when he was here in flesh that's promised in the morning so it's not here promised him the Millennium it's real sit on the throne of David ruling to 12 from there's a gap of Gentile dispensation that Christ didn't come here to settle them from physically right right right he never wanted to he would touch flesh but he wanted to get inside there people come he said when I leave and I come back I'm coming in you know I'm gonna be with you but I'm gonna be in here I'm gonna be around you don't know be in here all right so that was the part that calms look looking for here watch verse 4 and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness what by his resurrection all right so now he's took you from the outside to the inside because if the Flex didn't resurrect yourself hey is that all right the flesh of Jesus laid in that tomb for two days dead cold getting ready to corrupt didn't crush get ready to correct dead cells were dead organs were dead brain was dead so there had to be something because what Paul's saying he says all right now all you in the Old Testament your sacrifices they died but you never saw him come back they didn't kill the lamb in the next day the lamb was back alive again no they were dead but now right here by the resurrect from the dead right there buddy he sparked it to a group of people that it's not these sacrifices sure there's a fleshly lineage but you got to get away from that and come back to the lineage of that man that resurrected because like I said Jesus is flesh body never resurrected itself in itself I don't have of something the quickening power of the prophets say the quickening power what the same quicken afire you got you call what we're in Romans he's going to say the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead erase and quicken your mortal body so he's going to continue installing all right with this one more scripture Newell I don't want I want us to get done pretty quick here all right concerning his son Jesus Christ our Lord which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead by whom we have received Grace know what the wedding dress in the Old Testament yes there was but according to the people that saw it there was no grace do you either put this blame on that and when that lamb died you got forgiven and this lamb here and that Turtledove and you don't say one thing yes now watch here by whom we have received Grace and Apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations what for his name Jesus Christ all right among whom are ye also now he said he was called up in verse 1 yes called to be an apostle yes separated there are all Paul you got to be here no listen to a sermon among whom are you eat also the call of Jesus Christ all right do all that here in Rome beloved of God called to be Saints grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ now we're gonna take that word and and put even and you'll understand anyone Terry that grace be unto you peace from God our Father even the Lord Jesus Christ first I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world will stop right there in the heat there was a faith that the Romans had that no way outs had now that's kind of hard to believe cuz they're sitting over there in Rome but youth they had to have more faith because listen I was thinking last night look at the Roman Empire I mean they conquered the world and they weren't nice people right they came up with all this crucifixion and all these things of torture came from Rome the Romans so they're sitting in Rome being Christians and living the life kind of like the fourth church age were those Christians were living in the dark ages right giving their life for the gospel and here was Rome again took over but she agreed in the Bible on the for church age where they you know I in other words I'm not forgot you you got to enough faith to get through so that's why said the Bible now even reading the book of Romans I'm fat all first single second sealed third seal for Kiko okay so that's what I want you to do expand your horizons a little bit let's go for it Lord bless you we'll keep up we'll stay online do we get help with then we'll go to chapter 2 take more tests
