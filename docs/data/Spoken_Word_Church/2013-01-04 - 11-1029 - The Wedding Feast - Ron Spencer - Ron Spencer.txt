us to be here and we just come here to put our shoulder to the will that's right amen I had an uncle that was in the military and he was about my height and and he said it was always a great thing he said being our height he said you know you could just when you were when you were caught carrying great big things you could just stick your shoulder up and make it look like that you're really doing something so so all I've done tonight is just to kind of put my shoulder up a little bit so we certainly love you I I I I'll just tell you publicly i i i brother Wade gave me a pair of mocks one time and I still wear them I I almost wore them this this weekend but man they've been we've been friends a long time and you guys send me peons and we just had peon f p this week so am we love those and so I hope I preach good enough this weekend send me some more B amen Luke 14 forgive me for my foolishness God that's the way we preach Anyway by the foolishness of preaching men are saved so amen Luke chap 14 and verse 15 and one of when one of them that said at meat with him heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God then he said said unto him a certain man made a great supper and he made many and he sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bid come for all things are now ready and they with all one consent begin to make excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must needs go and see it I pray thee have me excused and another said I have I I have bought five yolk of oxen and I go to prove them I pray you have me excused and another said I have married a wife therefore I cannot come and so that the servant came and showed his Lord these things and the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and the lanes of the city yes sir and bring in hither the poor right and the maimed and the H and the blind Y and the said Lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said un the servant go out into the highways and the hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled that's right God is determined that's right yes sir for I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper you may be seated this afternoon amen I would like to I would like to just take a thought the wedding Feast this afternoon and and subtitle it cometh hither amen Matthew chapter 22 he kind of tells it in a in in a little bit of a different variation he says and Jesus answered and spake unto them by again by Parables and said the Kingdom of Heaven is likened to a certain King which made a marriage for his son and he sent forth servants to all of them went Bing to the wedding that they would not come and they would not come and again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which were bidden behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all the things are ready come un the marriage and they made light of it yeah and went their ways one to his farm and another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and in treated them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent for these armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city and then said he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bed were not worthy right go you therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find bid to the marriage and those servants went out to the highways and gathered together as many as they found both bad and good so we fit it right there we fit it right there all of us fit right in you'll find the scripture where you really fit in there's where you really fit in both bad and good Hallelujah so you know what you get right off the bat the wedding is ready but they were bitten were not worthy and he and and not notice how he says and those servants went on the highways and gathered as many as they found book bag and good and the wedding was furnished with guests and when the king came to see into see the guest he saw there a man which had not on the wedding garment and he said unto him friend now notice how he addresses him friend right how camest thou in hither not having on a wedding garment yeah and he was speechless right notice the statement he was speechless right M then said the king to his servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer Darkness there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth and then he began to say it like this for many are called right amen but few are chosen amen that's right Revelations chapter 3 and I I I just I just want to share some scriptures with you this afternoon Revelation 3 and: 18 notice this is to our age and he says I count counsel them and listen I I want to find God's counsel I I'm not so I'm not so concerned with men's counsel I I I definitely want to please God cuz there's a lot of things I can't please and a lot of men I can't please and cuz I can't please myself to be honest with you I counsel of thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may be rich and in white reignment that thou mayest be clothed right and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear GL and anoint thine eyes with ISAC that thou may see right right and as many as I love I rebuke and Chas it be zelous therefore and repent right notice how he says it behold I stand at the door and knock this age God came to this place and he be to knock behold I stand and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me and to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and was sat down with my father in his throne amen amen that's right oh don't you love the Lord this good to us that's right now now I I I very I very much realized when when Jesus was here he told a couple different types of invitations but there was a day one time when he was standing on the hillside brother R said a courier had went out and right he had be to try to he had been set by his by his head of the Master of the House to go and find this Jesus and he had made a huge feast and he was going to have in all the dignitaries and he was going to have in all of the people that was the well-known of society but he was also going to invite Jesus to purposely make fun of him and so brother Brandon will use this in several different occasions and and he went and this man he he begins to explain this man he says he looked high and low and he looked he looked at the hills he looked at the different places and he finally found Jesus and Jesus was having a meeting no doubt no doubt as as even brother brand says he he came and he says he said they tried to get to him but the disciples stopped him and they didn't want him to get to Jesus and no doubt they even thought and I'll just add a few things here no doubt they begin to think no way would Jesus go to this man's house right no way would he go to his house he's invited but no way would he go and show up at Simon's house but Jesus was not going for Simon exactly he would accept the invitation because he always goes where he's invited and so when he was invited to go they they didn't provide a robe for him they didn't provide a the the the perfume for him or they didn't wash his feet and he walked right among the dignitaries and and there he said in the unwelcome Corner if you might say and and and some said he was sitting on the bench some said he sitting on the floor it doesn't matter but but let me just say this to you he was sitting there no doubt able to read their minds exactly exactly amen no doubt able to see in the the chambers of their hearts exactly he can do that with the woman at to well knowing exactly if he can do that with the Pharisees and the Sadducees here he said in a room and he and he sitting there and would allow his own gift to operate he could he could look through their their righteous ropes and he could see what was going on the chambers of their hearts yes no doubt they call themselves righteous and religious amen we're not careful that's all we'll have right exactly all we'll be invited to the wedding Feast but we we will only want to come so far oh yeah and and you know we'll get a we'll get a new spirit we'll go to church and we'll sit on a Pew and we'll we'll sit there and we'll absorb the message and and we will even get the pastor's Spirit we'll even get maybe our favorite person in Church's spirit and we'll begin to conform to how the church operates how everything is happening we and before long we'll begin to listen to Tes and we'll come to church and we'll get a message lyrics come on and we'll get everything down just right we'll get the dress code down just right and if we ar if we aren't careful we miss Christ amen we'll get a box label of the message and it's stamped on us I was here so and so and there's no life on the inside of us I I say this to you if we go to school for 12 years in college and we get a doctorate degree and if we don't really pay attention we we'll make a very poor doctor you know if that gift isn't ignited we'll be just the mechanics of the doctor if we just go through the mechanics of of of learning how to do an airplane we we'll only we'll only just be able to teach somebody else if we're not careful we we we go through the mechanics of the message and it not live brother exactly it's one thing to be inv it's another to enjoy the feast that's right Hallelujah that's right there were many people that sat behind of brother Bram in the meetings and and come to our churches and sit there and they they live in a Justified state or in a Sanctified state but miss the presence of God living on the inside of them Jesus is sitting and just just sitting on waiting there they were in all of their their righteousness no doubt they were offering sacrifices and no doubt they were going and listening to the high priest as he he read the the script and they they felt within their hearts that they were all right yeah there was a woman oh my there was a woman just down the way come on that needed more than church that's right and this woman be to hear about everything that was going on yes and she came and she looked through the lattice work if we will and saw Jesus sitting there and a predestinated seed responded right there's something about a predestinated seed no matter how much the devil tries to muddle us up no matter how much he tries to destroy us no matter how much he tries to bombard our minds there's something about that seat on the inside of it once it's ignited and it comes into the right atmosphere you may have a lot of conditions in your life and complexes and everything else but God knows how to ignite that seed he knows how to ignite that seed when it comes in the right atmosphere and whether it was in haret form or whether it was a a drunk or a dope atdi it once that comes to life there's not a devil in hell that can destroy that life of God living inside of sometimes we ask ourselves why do I have such trouble right you know when I was in the world and I when I was drinking and I was I was smoking and I was I was doing all the things of habits of life that I was doing well I I didn't see have to fight in in a in a spiritual realm like I do now you know I you know I I don't understand you know I came to church and I I I sit on a Pew and I I give my heart to God but it seems like I'm in a war yeah amen it seems like I get out of bed on Monday morning we almost had Rapture Sunday but on Monday it seems like every Gate of Hell has just been turned loose on me and it and it and it just kind of I from my own observation it just feels like something's wrong somewhere well welcome to reality welcome to being a Christian it it's it's not Hollywood here and and you know it's not something that's put on but now you're in your molding State and if we could put it in almost a a story form if God could allow you to to to have been in the eternities with him and he could have told you you know now now here's the way it's going to work R I'm going to drop you down to the Earth and you're going to live so many years and and by the way I got a list of problems that you're going to go through now you're coming back to me but I got a list of problems you're going to go through in your life this is the way it's going to be I said hold it hold it right hold I'd rather not go through those problems oh brother Ron I want to go to heaven I I want to serve I I want to do I want to do whatever listen there's a molding process that you've got to go through oh brother Ron I believe when the Rapture takes place everything is going to be just just just every if everything's going to be fixed in my life somewhere between here and there amen somewhere between here and there there are some things that's going to be taken care of in your life exactly this fell that Jesus was talking about he came to this wedding Feast there some things that he had left out in his life yeah oh no doubt he was religious if we could put it that way no doubt he was religious I'm going I'm just going to speak to you like I'm speaking to a suay school class no doubt he was religious and no doubt he he served the Lord he he maybe had an easy believism yeah yeah you know no doubt he he believed if we could say it in our day and bring it to our day he believed brother Brown was a prophet he may have even lived in a Justified State of Mind you know and in his justification he could put his past life behind him maybe in sanctification he had he had cleansed his life up God had given him a new spirit and he cleansed his life and his habits up but he didn't have the wedding garment he didn't have the adoption Rob he wasn't he wasn't really didn't have the new birth he didn't have the life of God living on the inside of and you know you know without this you know you this is the token and you said well brother on all this message you know all of it all it just seems like it's so you know I can't understand this and I can't understand this and I can't understand this once he comes the scripture said he would lead and guide you in all truth he'll give you a highight that you'll be able to see him an ear that you'll be able to hear Glory it's just like coming to church and I know I'm just just kind of Bing here just for a few moments it's just like coming to church when you first get saved you come to church and you first get saved and you hear things you've never heard before in your life W there's stories that just fall off of the preacher's lips that that just why you've never heard anything like that ever before all you may have went to church after church after church but you know maybe there's been times that you walked away from church you said that's a biggest nut bunch of nuts I've ever seen in my life but seemed like next you found yourself starting right back there again right maybe you even shook the preacher's hand it was nice here but I'll probably never be back and there you are again and you see there was something on the inside of you about the size of a button that got ignited and God had been looking up for it are you with me now he knew where it was that but you know on the outward real you thought well I'll never go to church I've got a big fell that sits on the front row with me now it's actually second row he's 6'8 probably weighs about 270 sitting there he told me the other day he said I'll tell you brother Ron he said I hated preachers there's nothing about them that I like and I still can't figure out what I'm doing in church yeah right my family wasn't churchgoers oh but that seed of life amen exactly God knew exactly where you were at right amen amen that's right I'll never forget one time when I was there was a little lady came to the Altar and she said brother Ron my husband left me several years ago and and I I want him back I want him to come back to home and and I I want to be a real wife to him and and I want him to be a real Christian well I was thinking in my my own mind I was thinking well you probably better off than nut go but we prayed and the next Sunday morning as I preached there was a man sitting beside of her in church when I gave the offer call that man came to to the altar and when he came to the altar you know he just spent quite a long time at the altar and you know he just he just was a mess when he got up and he just W came up just picked me right up after after the service yeah this man this man be to talk to me he said you know it was Tuesday he said I I got back here Tuesday said oh oh he said but somewhere around 10:00 on Sunday just something spoke to my heart go home and he said I thinking in my mind my wife will never have me back but but I need to go back and make some things right so it was on Tuesday I was sitting on her porch when she came home from work and she and I told her exactly like this I don't even know why I'm here you'll probably kill me but something happened Sunday make come back oh Hallelujah that's kind of like that Salon just floating around out there and he's been there for quite a spell but something tells him go on and he'll go across the Niagara Falls if he needs to go right and God come told John in the Book of Revelations come up here right amen come up here you say well brother r i don't understand it don't worry about it he'll get you Grace don't try to figure it out by yourself he'll take care of that when you get right to it I don't know how to make you through that trial he'll give you Grace in the very moment of your trial he'll give you strength exactly where you're at amen that's right can I deal with that invitation just a couple moments I I'll never forget I was preaching the meeting the pastor asked me said now brother Ron here's here's this is a big challenge for you he said but here's what I want you to do he said we're kind of having a field day in this meeting this first night of the meeting he said we kind of have a fi day we got a big gymnasium here and going to be a lot of people coming and he says it's kind of a setup he said right at the end I want you to preach here's what I want you to do I want you to come in a T-shirt and a sweatshirt and blue jeans yeah don't mind said okay okay that's that's not a challenge the way I dress every day can I do this the rest of the me yeah so they they they had ate they had played basketball they played their volleyball they did their thing and at the end of it they said they started setting up you know chairs and so there was worldly people that said what are we doing here and they save dessert till the very last you got to keep people with food you know I don't know if we got food here tonight but you know something to do so anyway uh I I I was sitting there as I I begin to speak there was a man that was that was there and as I was speaking he began to get very upset and he I I noticed as he would tell his wife you know he he was so upset you know trying to get out and trying to leave and tore all the pieces and so cuz the meeting was going on then it came alter time and I just begin to talk you know and I noticed this man as he got up he walked right straight to me amen and he had his black leather coat on and his Spikes all out of his black leather coat he ever hears his tape he'll know I'm talking about him and he walks up and he says I need God than and we begin to pray Oh Glory that man's now a deacon in the church somewhere he knows exactly where you're at right he knows exactly what your situation is that would be in your life right he knew exactly where that little woman was living at right that's right but he needed to be invited by Simon that he could have open invitation to deal with her and Simon may have thought that he was inviting him but he was only a tool in the path of a predestinated SE being born that's right right Hallelujah coming to life when Jesus begins to talk about this supper and he as he begins to lay it out and he begins to talk about this man had bought a piece of ground and this man had married a wife and this man had bought oxen and you can take every type that you could take but listen let me just bring it to us tonight in this layot of see and Age come on brother when Satan would like to bombard every one of our minds we're very aware here tonight that we are the final voice to the final we are very aware that we're the ones that have taken the book and we have eaten the book that's right we when when John was commissioned to eat the book and and and to take it all in not just parts of it but eat the whole book and and when this message came to us it was more right listen I I've been around it since I was a diapers but but this message is more than a man it's more than we it's more than just his personality but this is Christ his Bri for and it's more than just pastors it's more than just teachers it's more than just a fivefold Ministry but down to the littlest child sure sure you will see sure you will see the the humanness of us all amen if I get around you long enough I I'll find some qualities that you're struggling with if you get around me long enough you'll find that there's things about me that I'm struggling with but the god part of every one of us am amen that that that's that God part of us that God depositing on the inside of us knowing that we will live in the most deceitful age the age where that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible if it were possible would deceive where the boundary lines are so blurred right amen right they're so blurred everybody's born again so blur it's almost a political gospel anymore Clos line preaching is almost out are you with me now uh doctrinal lines have been drawn and this one fighting this one the devil done a real good job didn't he cuz listen if he can't whip you he joins you he can't push you down it pushes you up he can't make you feel like a hypocrite it makes you feel like the most righteous person in the building amen that's right exactly so what he'll do is he'll educate you in the message what he'll do is he'll make it easy for you what he'll do he'll say well you know you don't have to go to church you just yeah listen to a tape once in a yeah if you aren't careful there's no new birth right exactly that's the trth thank you we're not careful the things of the world right and he'll make us every offer oh yeah you said well brother Ron we don't struggle with those things sure we do sure we do I don't care if you live in a tent you struggle with things that's right we all struggle right because it's it's our predes destinated hour to live in darkness and there's conditions in darkness that you and I have to live in because we're the Bride of this part of this age that's right are you with me brother Ron the Revival is it it it's just not happening well I don't know where you're living now but I'll tell you what if you get in his presence it's happening right now I don't like to bend here when brother brand was preaching all those me I'd love to be here but that wasn't when I was supposed to be born but this is the greatest hour that I know and every generation must have its own personal Revival exactly young people let me just say this to you tonight this message is just as much real to you as it is to me Glory that's right yes sir exct amen you know I I asked my boys I've got two boys and a girl my little girl's 20 years old it's hard to believe a it my baby doll is you know I used to carry her around I used to carry around in one of those little swing dresses and I twirl her and I dance with her and it would fly out now my baby dog yeah you know she's 20 years old driving my car yeah going to school wanting to be a teacher yeah why I told every boy in the country I had guns and finally there came along a guy that don't care about my guns he's got a long way to go yet but you know when brother Brown talks about a token it's more than just a good message that's right right it's more than a few quotes that says you know we've not come together to talk about the the message but to get into the message right and it's and it's more than just the chemistry of the blood cuz we can understand that that the blood of Christ washed every one of our sins away in the very life Calvary was the difference for us and it's more than the than the than a bottle of blood or blood that was shed on the ground but we realize what the atonement really was for us right and we realize that this message has the cleansing power that is within us sir where we don't have to live a halfway life where we don't have to give excuse so why we don't live right are you with me now now listen I I I personally and I I I'm just I just going to deliver my heart here this evening I personally don't want to be the man standing for the wedding Feast with excuses exactly amen that's right exactly right there's not a piece of property in this entire County or counties right amen that I want to put in front of God right there's not a job right come on I don't care whether you got the best job in the world come on brother amen or how much money that you make right there's none of those things that I want to put ahead of God right exactly amen you said well brother Ron that's that's a Works gospel no that's a Love Gospel Glory yes sir because when you fall in love with God right there's nothing that really matters well brother I you know but I I've got to do this and I've got to do this well let let me just speak to you about God do amen Jesus was standing just before his Ascension he's been at Calvary making it simple he's resurrected he's been with them about 40 days they've seen some phenomenal things right why some will have stories that he was with them that all day long Y and he took them all the way through the scriptures and we didn't know who he was until right he finally breaks some bread for our we identified who he was I heard but now I see brother BR said let's just go back and listen to him he he gives all the scriptures that he goes through did he fulfill this yes he did did he fulfill this yes he did did he fulfill this yes he did that's right at the end they compel him to come in he said all You' got to do is just compel him to come in right right just con train on him just a little bit he'll come oh brother R we didn't have church tonight well you didn't invite him evidently I don't care where it's Tuesday night Wednesday night Sunday morning he's always here but it depends on did you invite him to the service need you invite him to where you're sitting Glory here was 500 people that was standing there and he just simply tells them now now go to the upper room you T there and you'll be ued with powerful on high yeah right 380 people heard that message all we know about the 120 right but I definitely wouldn't want to be one of the 380 exactly right 380 made some excuses and in those excuses go ahead none of them were more important than being at the upper room exactly exactly none of them were more important right exactly you know every week here brother Samuel's been a friend for a long long time BL had greatest respect for him amen but God speaks to him all week long you haven't you haven't challenge me to say these things so here I am and he studies all week right and a sermon is more than a than a compilation of folks exactly or even a motivational speaker but that's a life a life experience put together in a thought and it takes much thought just to bring it to an hour however long you speak just to bring it to try to speak to your heart exactly and in that speaking to the heart many times we walk into the atmosphere of the building and the song reader will challenge us all right now let's sing all right now let's worship all right now let's let's just try to get here on time all right now we should have prayed and and you know we we'll go through those things and the minister steps to the pit whether we know it or not our responsibility on the other end of the line am I ready amen that's right hey this is simple tonight but here I am amen am I ready to receive what God has for me tonight we have been biding to this wedding Feast right right we've been bid to this wedding feast and depends on what you're going through during your weeks and months depends on what you're going through is what's going to come through sometimes your eyesight eyesight oh brother I've heard that sermon before but did you hear it in the condition that you're living in just now exactly right and many times we give this excuse oh I heard all the takes years ago but listen listen to them again right in your growth process you've grow a little rich and you will see more this week than you saw 10 years ago the Revival would be greater now than it was 10 years ago because he's an I am god notice what he says behold I stand at the Lord this was Christ coming to his wife amen bow the voice of a Kian amen amen exactly Hallelujah borrowing his voice speaking to his wife these are more than quotes which you're the physical living physical attributes of God that he thought of before the foundation of the world that's right bless Brother Sam and I spoke earlier today of course he didn't know where I was going this evening yeah sometimes we think well you know God don't love me or we get the we get the idea I'm all alone yeah but what God did for you before you ever got here is incredible that's right right well let's just take in very elementary form he took a picture of you before the foundational the world that's correct at your best right God thought of you mhm this isn't like a photo album that you flip through right but God thought of you and if you're ever in these Eternal thoughts right amen come on come on exactly if you're ever in his eternal thoughts he's not the kind of business man that just kind of goes through and thumbs I don't know if this is a good idea or not he's not the kind of project manager that starts it out and then decides it's not worth it he he's he's not the kind of that starts to build a house and then decided I can't count off the cost listen he sees through right that's right thank you Lord the project all brother you'll never know where that person was at or where they are you'll never know my my loved ones my children they're so far away from God uh-uh come on brother the guy standing before you tonight was homeless at one time right living in a drug house at one time right but I had a father and mother that didn't give up on me reminding God you made a covenant with us right exactly are you with me right you made a covenant with this God he is our husband right we take him at his word listen God is as good as his word right that's right made a covenant with God are you with me now God no matter where those thoughts are just now listen those attributes are now regardless of where they are now and many times there was no doubt there was much shame that I brought to my family brought to the church that I'd once been a part of but God who is rich in Mercy come on God who is rich in Mercy knows how to find you where you are amen that's true me thank you Lord so when we get the idea there's no way that's when God does business right that's right exactly I just keep feeling to go that way just for a few moments I'll never forget I was preaching in Billy Andrew's Church we quite a large meeting and the first night I had spoke on the on the autopsy of a dead Church yeah brother Cherry tizzle was my friend and he made the statement he said I believe everything that breede shouted here T night and so so the next night I was I was getting ready to I I went home that evening and from the meeting and on the way home I just felt impressed what you have for tomorrow night will not work and so I I just you know as a minister you just feel that empty Hollow spot yes sir and so I I just I begin to pray because I don't want to waste any time we don't have that kind of energy and so I just I begin to pray I I went to bed and I was just unsettled and somewhere around 4:00 I I woke up and the Lord took me to the woman at the well and as I as I just begin to think on these thoughts I thought now Lord what where do you want me to go with this and I just kept just feeling impressed you stay right here you stay right here so I went to the pulpit that evening and I was thinking Lord these people going to think I'm the one most simple preacher in the world so I be to deal with it I dealt with it about an hour and I just felt have prayer just now and as I bowed my head there was a girl that ran from the back back of that building and she came running and I'll never forget brother Billy he didn't know what was getting ready to go on and neither did I as a matter of fact I didn't even see her coming and brother Billy ran and grabbed her and he grabbed her she she she was getting ready to jump on the platform he grabbed her and she began I'm lost and I need God yeah and come to find out in a few moments she had just left her last customer as a harlot and a voice spoke to her go to this certain certain place God knows am as far as I know she's still a real sister amen thank you Lord God knows exactly where we are in our life glory and the thing about God is he's not embarrassed about our state that's right I know that might be a little difficult for us as human beings to look at one another well they got a ways to grow or they got a place to do or you know this one's not growing don't worry about that exactly God knows what he's got to do with us to get us where he needs to get us oh if we' got our mind too much on this or too much on that he knows how to take care of that amen that's right amen you know sometimes we as ministers feel that if we're not careful we're like parents we get embarrassed by our children yeah and we're constantly always having to defend our children my children never do that don't kid yourself or maybe we're trying to make an easier way for our children all you got to do is believe no you got to have a birth oh you got to just come to church no you got to have a birth and I would tell my children I knew I'd pick my thought up after a little bit I tell my children I tell them I said now listen boys listen I call her I said listen let me just tell you this you've got to know the same Christ amen that we got right this message is more than brother Brown I want you to listen to it I don't want you to listen to it over and over again and when you come to church I want you to hold in on the every word that Minister say cuz he may preach an hour but it may be one sentence in that entire strength that will come right directly to your spot because your need get SP amen yes sir Hallelujah we were reminded you're not feeding on the the mind of a man you're feeding on the body word of the son of manise the scripture says what manner of persons ought we to be and all holy conversation and godliness looking and and fast and Hasting for the and the Hast and un the coming of the day wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved in the elements shall melt with fervent heat right man so what would good it would do for us to own the whole world right come on brother exactly Y and the scripture says and lose our soul right amen notice what he says here in Revelations 10 I know this very familiar to but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel right he shall begin to sound right the mystery of God should be finished see it declared unto his servants the prophet and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again I said go and take the book amen now we've been commissioned go take this book that's not just to Brother Sam or to brother brother D here and myself exactly it's not just to our favorite preachers right you amen exactly go take this word go absorb this word eat this book and which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth listen this book is openen it's not a closed book anymore oh oh but I'm I'm a mystery preacher no no it's been revealed amen no it's been revealed all but one great day this is the day if you're looking off for some Yonder somewhere another listen it's it's open for us I'm not waiting on an event I'm not waiting for some personality to come this is this is this is our book exactly this is our Awakening right Jesus amen hallelujah that's rightl brother Ron I I I don't understand the I don't I'm just taking some Elementary things here go ahead I don't understand it I don't understand how you guys get so excited about such simple thoughts yeah well I don't understand how how a prophet with such a a small education would talk about bovin and Shakespeare right right that's right I just don't understand at all right you know I thought I was escaping Shakespeare when I left school but here I come to Shalom and brother Brown reminds us of Shakespeare in bethoven my daughter-in-law has a double master since you wouldn't even know what to talk to her but in in school in Theology and composition oh my not in theology but in in in composition and she shoot right there but she Theory and composition Theory there you go and so I was quoting this about Beethoven and so she was going through a pretty comprehensive study and and they said want you tell me a little bit about him of course we knew some things yeah bethoven was quite an incredible composer but really his gift wasn't honed until he lost his hearing right and in losing his hearing you see under the pressure of losing his hearing he had to cut the legs off at his piano and he would put his ear and on the floor and he would write out his music yeah y his weakness drove him to a masterpiece right Glory am right amen and though he couldn't hear his music even played it drove him into isolation y whether he was a very irritable human being y he couldn't be around people hey as a matter of fact going up and down the street it was difficult for him to communicate with anybody so he kind of been become such an edgy person that there was but yet seemed like everything that he touched was masterpieces right and so I was dealing with her about you know what brother brandom says you know the Note S and you know the director gets under the spirit of the composer and yet and then you know when that syphony is played together every character comes into its right place and it's every one of them's personal responsibility that's right and so this one will begin to come and this one will begin to come and maybe it's a national Symphony I've got a I've got a cousin that plays in it and and there's people that come from all over the United States and even the world bringing their instruments to play in this certain Orchestra and they are at the they're at their top of their level of their life and they come in and and they they come and they play together and they they practice together and when they begin and they're sitting there I've actually been there and when they're sitting there it sounds like a huge bunch of just noise and to a red Knight like myself it's just nonsense right and I'm wondering why it's even worth the price of admission but this guy grabs a stick come on and maybe he's ballhead or he's got a shock of hair and he's standing there and he begins to shake that stick and a certain direction and it's a chosen piece maybe from Beethoven or from BL right but it's more than a piece of music to him brother exactly it's more than just a bunch of lyrics that are putting together but this one is gathered from here and this one's gathered from here and they brought their instrument and they are at their best oh they may be a flute player but they're one of the best in the whole world they're one of the best in the whole world that listen they stand up they stand out no matter where they're at or who they're playing with but today there was 600 other people and they're sitting there and they're going to have a part right right amen come on they're going to have a part or maybe the triangle player he's going to have a part the symbol players got a part the trion's got a part and every one of them come to their part right right right come on now alone don't sound like a whole lot right right yeah but put it together right right exactly put it together right right now I I will say this to you there are times we as ministers come on bless we know some of your struggles yeah right if we've got how we pull them M but when you're under the inspiration of the word and it's more than a quote and knowing you've been gathered from all ends of Earth come on brother and you come and you're the very best that God could have thought of listen because if God could have got better he would have got better that's correct am are you with me listen a a as a as a minister of this day listen when God was predestinated people to live in the age of martydom he had the best that he could have he had the best of lay to say you you are the best that he could have that's right am you are the final voice you're trumpeting this word out when you're in Walmart I know you go there when you're in Walmart amen when you're on your job you may never give a quote right come on you may never let something come across your lips but an atmosphere an atmosphere is around you you live in an atmosphere of this world Amen exactly and your life is playing so loud oh hallelujah amen that's right Hallelujah that's right are you with me now amen the scripture talks about anpus and I may not say it exactly right that was in the age and only his name was mentioned right yeah right only his name was mentioned he was living literally in Satan's seat and I'm not going to spend much time there but he had such a life right no he wasn't the messenger of the hour but what a representative he was that's right what a representative of the message that he was right for his day right am what a representative that our life is right exactly amen oh hallelujah amen Revelations 12:10 and I heard a a loud voice in heaven saying now has come salvation and strength in the Kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ right for the accus of our Brethren is cast down amen which accused them before God day and night and they overcame right by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony and they love not their lives even unto death let me just say this to you that's the final voice of the final age oh brother Ron but when will I have my voice you are when brother Ron now the scripture says now are we the sons of God this is our age amen oh one day when we're all gathered together let me just say this to you if you was one of those musicians in the symphony you don't hone your skill setting in the symphony right right rightly cuz there was times when you blow on the flute you made some pretty wicked sounds right yeah there was times that you sat down at the piano if you're a master at piano there were times that nobody wanted to hear you right there were times the first time you preached that people said I came here for that I came here for that oh he he sweated he cried yeah and even the old Pastor would say it's the worst I've ever heard heard y That's Right wow that's the worst that I've ever heard Billy I need to see you in the office I need to

on no law right right yeah right exactly and you know there's times that we come to church and we want every emotional trickle of our body shook right yeah we want the education part of our intellect to be so intrigued yeah we want the music in a certain way and we want the songs in a certain way and God comes by and sits in the unwelcome Corner exactly waiting on you to wash his feet right
