[4:47] speak to her hearts in Jesus name
[4:51] so we'll go back and read on Ephesians
[4:53] now because we're going to be picking up
[4:56] some things and you know going on a
[4:59] little bit and you know I was going to
[5:01] read every service but it just we just
[5:03] read so much of it so
[5:05] look Ephesians 1 3 blessed be the
[5:09] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[5:12] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[5:14] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[5:16] according as he had chosen Us in him
[5:19] before the foundation of the world that
[5:22] we should be holding Without Blame
[5:23] before him in love having predestinated
[5:26] us unto the adoption of children by
[5:28] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[5:31] good pleasure of his will
[5:33] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[5:36] wherein he hath made us accepted into
[5:38] Below in whom we have Redemption through
[5:41] his blood the Forgiveness of sins
[5:42] according to the riches of his grace
[5:45] we're in here to mount it toward us in
[5:48] all wisdom and Prudence having made
[5:50] known unto us the mystery of his will
[5:53] according to the good pleasure which he
[5:56] hath purposed to himself that in the
[5:58] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[6:00] might gather together and want all
[6:02] things in Christ for which are in heaven
[6:05] and which are on earth even in him in
[6:08] whom also we have obtained an
[6:10] inheritance being predestinated
[6:12] according to the purpose of him who
[6:14] worketh all things after the Council of
[6:16] his own will that we should be to the
[6:19] praise of his glory he first trusted in
[6:22] Christ in whom he also trusted after
[6:25] that you heard the word of Truth The
[6:28] Gospel of your salvation and whom also
[6:30] after that you believed you were sealed
[6:32] with that Holy Spirit of Promise which
[6:35] is the earnest of our inheritance until
[6:37] the Redemption of the purchased
[6:39] possession unto the praise of
[6:43] his glory and let's go over to
[6:47] second Corinthians
[6:50] 5.
[6:55] verse 1.
[6:57] but we know that if our Earthly House of
[7:00] this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[7:02] building of God and house not made with
[7:05] hands
[7:06] Eternal in the heavens for in this we
[7:09] groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed
[7:11] upon with our house which is from Heaven
[7:14] if so be that being clothed we should
[7:17] not be found naked
[7:19] for we that are in this Tabernacle do
[7:22] groan being burdened not for that we
[7:25] would be
[7:27] unburdened not far that we would be
[7:30] unclothed but clothed upon that
[7:33] mortality might be slaughtered up of
[7:34] life
[7:35] now he that hath brought
[7:39] us for the self-same thing is God who
[7:42] also has given us given unto us the
[7:45] earnest of the spirit you may be seated
[7:47] Lord that is blessing
[7:49] to the reading of the word now we'll get
[7:51] to that verse in a little while
[7:53] you know to speak a little bit about it
[7:56] from Corinthians and uh you know
[8:01] I'm trying my best to get a point across
[8:04] to you and and uh you know
[8:07] I want to make sure you understand
[8:10] what I'm trying to say
[8:12] because I believe that the real part of
[8:15] you
[8:17] is your soul because that's you
[8:21] right that's the real you right you said
[8:25] with now the body in the spirit now with
[8:27] the body of spirit and we're a unit we
[8:29] you know we would have to have that but
[8:31] even after this this body is rotten away
[8:35] in the ground and the spirit goes back
[8:37] to God who gave it or whatever
[8:39] steal the soul of an individual will
[8:42] live on
[8:44] and and even if you're an unregenerated
[8:48] your soul is where you're at waiting the
[8:52] Judgment Day and the things you know so
[8:54] then it's the real you now the bride of
[8:57] Christ don't have no judgment day so we
[8:59] know where they go and souls under the
[9:02] altar to cry how long not to avenge our
[9:05] blood but to how long in other words
[9:07] come on you on Earth and let's get this
[9:09] thing on on and of course they can uh
[9:13] have a connection in some way to You and
[9:16] I by the faith that they were all right
[9:20] now she's in the soul of man is that
[9:23] part of you that will even be will even
[9:26] continue after your body and spirit is
[9:30] dissolved or whatever you want to say
[9:31] about it gone or destroyed or whatever
[9:34] all right because the soul is that part
[9:37] of you that God begins to work on
[9:40] now just to say these few things to to
[9:42] get make sure you follow me
[9:45] because that's what he begins to work on
[9:47] us in the New Birth the new birth is not
[9:50] in your body it is not in your spirit
[9:54] he deals with those situations and
[9:57] Realms that we talk about but the real
[10:00] part of you where God begins to deal is
[10:03] in that Soul now we'll get back to more
[10:05] so if you will study souls in prison and
[10:08] you know it'll help you especially maybe
[10:10] the first 10 15 pages you know I've sold
[10:14] in prison and then we'll get back to it
[10:16] a little later on
[10:18] but as mortal beings
[10:21] we seem to want to put more emphasis
[10:26] upon our body
[10:29] you know right because that's the part
[10:32] of us that we claim to be real or
[10:35] whatever you know tangibles or whatever
[10:39] it is but just remember that
[10:42] what's inside of us is more real
[10:46] than the body that we're living in amen
[10:49] because as I said it lives on even after
[10:53] we're gone now whether you're saved or
[10:56] not
[10:57] right it will go it will live on
[11:00] somewhere until a Day of Reckoning you
[11:04] know of the shoulders or the Rapture
[11:06] comes for the bride of Christ
[11:08] but now
[11:13] you what God begins or they're said to
[11:16] work on that show
[11:19] because that's where salvation's at it's
[11:22] not in your body
[11:23] it's not in your spirit it's in your
[11:26] soul all right and that's the part God
[11:29] begins to deal with you so that's the
[11:31] real part of you
[11:33] I mean something that you can't even uh
[11:36] show to somebody maybe right but yet
[11:39] it's more real than all that can be seen
[11:41] amen
[11:42] because it's the real you right that's
[11:44] where you live at that's where your see
[11:47] our problem was that we were sold into
[11:50] sin in the the domain of Satan and being
[11:54] sold into the domain of Satan then uh
[11:57] right around and said those angels they
[12:00] give us the nature right all right
[12:04] and they pervert our nature we started
[12:07] out right because God created us perfect
[12:09] not Eternal right Perfect Right made us
[12:12] right Body Spirit and soul as much as
[12:15] possible of the body but the spirit and
[12:17] soul being a perfect creation because
[12:19] God can't create something imperfect I
[12:23] keep emphasizing that because I I want
[12:26] us to hold on to that point all right
[12:28] but see then
[12:30] God comes down and he starts to deal
[12:33] with us
[12:34] now here's where our problem is
[12:38] he begins to deal with us in the soul
[12:43] but yet you can make Christians in the
[12:47] realm of as we call it the word
[12:49] Christian using it in the realm of
[12:52] anointed ones
[12:54] you know
[12:56] and look at the things that are done
[12:58] look at the the way man goes and and all
[13:01] so you can become a a religious person
[13:05] right
[13:07] and just be if the prophet says you can
[13:10] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[13:11] day of your life
[13:13] on your spirit and dying go down right
[13:15] still be lost
[13:17] see that way then I believe the biggest
[13:19] portion of the religious world are
[13:22] religion religious in their Spirit realm
[13:25] right yes sir amen I don't believe
[13:27] they're religious in their soul you know
[13:29] what I'm saying that's so dark that's
[13:30] right
[13:31] but see some way you cut off
[13:35] allowing that soul to have control
[13:39] and then that's what brother Brown says
[13:41] people do he says they'll they'll give
[13:43] all their calls
[13:45] and they'll they'll go out among the
[13:47] congregation you know or something or
[13:49] tell somebody call them out you know now
[13:51] Gary you you need to get an altar you
[13:53] know hey
[13:55] and right around says you'll make that
[13:57] person a twofold child of hell that's
[13:59] right he said God is harder the next
[14:00] time to get to it right I know my sister
[14:03] I've told you many times she came to me
[14:04] in the church and Samuel you need to go
[14:07] to the altar you're an ojc Huber dare
[14:09] said he didn't have a chance to be saved
[14:11] well I thought more of his salvation and
[14:13] him never claiming anything I did hers
[14:17] I'm just honest you know but the point
[14:20] I'm getting at is
[14:21] we do like
[14:23] the Philippian Jailer said
[14:26] you know
[14:28] Paul and him you know there and
[14:30] repeating him they're in prison you know
[14:32] and uh
[14:34] when he saw something Supernatural take
[14:37] place all right right and he knew about
[14:40] them being a Christian he knew why they
[14:42] were in there right so then when
[14:44] something Supernatural took place he
[14:47] said what must I do to be saved
[14:51] okay now I gave you some quotes from
[14:52] Brother random that you know to me it is
[14:55] very fitting because like I said you you
[14:57] go out and you you talk to people and
[14:59] you and you you try to you really
[15:02] embarrassing them
[15:04] on that blessed God I felt led
[15:07] all right you're gonna have to argue
[15:09] with your Prophet about it not me I'm
[15:11] not going to argue with you at all
[15:13] I felt led to go talk to them was it
[15:18] your leadership or was it the Holy
[15:20] Spirit
[15:22] now I'm not against you if God told you
[15:24] right
[15:26] but I'm just telling you what your
[15:28] Prophet said
[15:29] he says you make it harder for that
[15:32] person to come to the Lord in other
[15:34] words
[15:34] right my coach you embarrassing you put
[15:37] them in a situation and they won't come
[15:39] back to church or something because why
[15:40] because you're going to talk to him
[15:42] again
[15:43] well you don't believe in talking to
[15:44] people now there's
[15:46] way in mind and run it all you want to
[15:48] talk to people about the Lord but don't
[15:51] embarrass them that's right
[15:54] don't get right out in the big old group
[15:58] gang call it you need you know the
[16:01] Lord's neither will you you need to come
[16:02] to the Lord you need salvation right in
[16:04] front of everybody go to him privately
[16:08] three
[16:10] right you didn't want nobody to do you
[16:12] that away
[16:15] they may have but you didn't like it
[16:19] but that's what I'm talking about see we
[16:21] talk about salvation
[16:23] we talk about the new birth
[16:26] yeah
[16:27] and it can only be the first of the show
[16:29] right
[16:31] and you can fill a church up full of
[16:33] people
[16:34] and it'll still all be lost right
[16:37] well you don't believe in going out and
[16:39] winning the people to the Lord yes I do
[16:42] but your Prophet said it I didn't he
[16:45] said a life lived is a greater testimony
[16:49] than all of your words he said because
[16:52] your life hinders so much I can't hear
[16:54] your words because your life is in the
[16:57] way
[16:58] that was where it was with me when I was
[17:00] 18 years old before it even was even
[17:02] converted in a Baptist Church one
[17:04] because people wouldn't have said they
[17:06] come to me and they'd say you need to
[17:07] get saved I said I live a better life
[17:09] your Deacon board does
[17:13] I wasn't hateful I'm telling the truth
[17:17] all right but see we get in the way so
[17:20] the Philippian Jailer said what must we
[17:22] do to be saved look what your Prophet
[17:24] said
[17:26] this was off in Hebrews chapter 2 part 1
[17:30] and 57 825 today we got so many things
[17:33] you have to do
[17:38] now watch it
[17:41] now this is your prophet
[17:46] today we got so many things
[17:49] you have to do
[17:52] have to turn new pages
[17:56] you don't want people turning you pages
[18:03] you have to do this
[18:04] and do that in order to get saved
[18:08] he's saying what we we try to do
[18:12] see I thank the Philippian Jailer when
[18:16] this Jailer asked Paul what must I do to
[18:18] be saved into being you or I we'd have
[18:21] told him the things he ought not to do
[18:25] you ought to quit smoke drinking you
[18:28] ought to quit your gambling your
[18:30] gambling you ought to quit this you
[18:32] ought to quit off to quit that Paul
[18:34] never told him that he just told him the
[18:36] things he just told him the things he
[18:40] ought to do
[18:42] now what was it believe on the Lord
[18:44] Jesus Christ and I shall be saved
[18:51] all right now that's what we do
[18:54] somebody comes to church want to be
[18:55] saved where do we start telling them
[18:58] you need to quit this you need to quit
[19:00] that you need to stop doing that you
[19:01] need to start doing this
[19:04] now show it to me in the Bible where
[19:06] that's at
[19:12] well I just feel led all right
[19:15] that's between you and the Lord
[19:21] and I think a lot of the people's
[19:23] leadership is their own leadership
[19:25] man
[19:28] Lord tells you to go deal with somebody
[19:30] healed in on the other end
[19:32] amen that's what the prophet said
[19:34] all right watch what he said
[19:36] turning northward 61 129. like a
[19:40] Philippian Jailer that night when he
[19:41] said what must I do to be saved
[19:43] well we will we do
[19:46] we tell him what not to do
[19:49] you got to quit doing this you got to
[19:51] quit going over there you got to quit
[19:53] doing this he never asked what he had to
[19:56] quit doing doing he asked what he could
[20:00] what he could he do to be saved right
[20:05] all told and no misunderstanding words
[20:10] he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[20:11] and thou shalt be saved that's all get
[20:14] the faith of God back into people so
[20:17] that they'll know what to do and how to
[20:19] act not say come over and join our group
[20:22] in other words come in the message you
[20:24] believe the message you gotta believe
[20:25] this message if you're gonna be saved
[20:28] is that what's been put in most of your
[20:30] faces
[20:33] right
[20:35] come over and join that group
[20:38] just get them back to God God will do
[20:42] the rest of it of it get them into the
[20:45] kingdom oh Finance Jehovah Jireh 1961
[20:48] 209.
[20:51] you know the thing of it today when a
[20:53] sinner comes to the Lord
[20:54] we don't treat them like Paul did when
[20:58] the Philippian Jailer said what must I
[21:00] do to be saved
[21:01] now what would we say today
[21:04] you got to quit smoking you got to quit
[21:06] drinking you got to quit doing this
[21:08] that wasn't what he asked
[21:11] he said what must I do to be saved and
[21:15] Paul told him believe on the Lord Jesus
[21:16] Christ
[21:17] leave on the Lord Jesus Christ not come
[21:20] join our congregation and stand up
[21:22] before the church and say this
[21:25] and we'll sprinkle you immerse you or
[21:27] whatever you want to do our way
[21:30] and if if if you're not in our church
[21:34] then that wasn't it he said believe on
[21:36] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy
[21:39] house shall be saved amen
[21:42] all right
[21:44] if you can believe for yourself you can
[21:46] believe for your house or also amen have
[21:48] enough faith in God to believe for
[21:50] yourself then believe for your children
[21:51] also amen that same faith will save your
[21:54] children that saved you
[21:57] if you just keep praying God will answer
[22:00] prior don't worry
[22:02] just ask him and believe it and get it
[22:04] anchored in your heart and just keep
[22:06] moving on that's the way it's done
[22:14] the house 1961.
[22:17] 808
[22:18] did you notice
[22:21] now did you notice you and I today and
[22:25] most all ministers
[22:27] are so forth we're always trying to tell
[22:30] a feller what not to do
[22:34] now he put himself to her so you argue
[22:37] with him that way
[22:38] we'd say now quit you smoking quit your
[22:41] line quit your Stephen quit this or that
[22:45] that wasn't what the man asked
[22:48] he he didn't say what do I have to quit
[22:51] doing to be saved he said what must I do
[22:53] to be saved see we try to tell them what
[22:56] they must stop doing see and say well I
[23:00] must do this that or the other
[23:03] no
[23:04] that isn't the question what must I do
[23:07] not what must I stop doing
[23:10] but you just do what you're supposed to
[23:13] do
[23:14] you know what
[23:15] and all the rest that will take care of
[23:18] itself
[23:19] you're lying and stealing or drinking
[23:21] and gambling and doing the things that's
[23:23] evil it'll stop when you do that Paul
[23:25] answered the question what must I do to
[23:28] be saved believe on the Lord Jesus
[23:30] Christ
[23:30] and die in thy house will be saved
[23:33] and it's not going to save your house
[23:35] because you believe right
[23:39] because you believe that's right they
[23:41] must come to their own salvation but if
[23:43] they're watching you
[23:46] and you're trying to tell them the wrong
[23:48] way to get to God how can they be saved
[23:50] so get to God first
[23:53] it's my brother Adele Don't Preach like
[23:55] all these other preachers you know I
[23:56] learned screaming about the clothes you
[23:58] wear the things you do get born to end
[24:00] it'll take care of that
[24:02] that's right amen
[24:04] if you're doing it you're not born again
[24:06] right
[24:08] well you're telling me I'm lost right
[24:10] I'm telling you you lost amen
[24:12] that's right
[24:14] what else you want me to say
[24:18] oh that's going on what am I tell me I'm
[24:20] lost will it Bruce you're lost then
[24:22] because of the attitude all right
[24:25] you get upset about somebody saying
[24:27] something that proves you wrong all
[24:28] right
[24:30] which see salvation starts in the soul
[24:32] of man when we deal on the body and
[24:35] spirit to try to get people saved
[24:39] we think it's because we get them to
[24:41] church because we get them to believe
[24:43] the message because we get them to
[24:45] baptized correctly because we get them
[24:47] to quote a Creed
[24:51] no let's will and do it
[24:54] but is that salvation
[25:00] salvation must start in the real you in
[25:02] the soul get your soul right the body
[25:04] and spirit is going to obey
[25:06] right
[25:08] but around said it's impossible to get a
[25:11] holy ghost for a woman to put on purpose
[25:14] you put them on you're proven yourself
[25:19] you need salvation
[25:22] right
[25:24] what don't you think we're to live good
[25:25] no I told you that over and over don't
[25:28] think we're gonna live good I think
[25:29] we're to be born again amen
[25:33] the life will take care of itself amen
[25:36] but you can quit smoking you can quit
[25:37] drinking quit everything you're going to
[25:39] do that don't save you
[25:44] because you're trying to deal with the
[25:46] body and the spirit of a person
[25:48] something you can see
[25:51] right
[25:56] the church seen this what must we do to
[25:58] be saved
[26:01] start with the inward part of you
[26:06] let that inward part of you
[26:08] it's real right
[26:11] there is where God's deal is
[26:14] well I believe the message brother Dale
[26:16] amen
[26:19] I quit this and I quit dead amen
[26:24] then you see people turn around and
[26:25] going back right and doing it again
[26:28] right
[26:29] must not have been delivered right
[26:33] and that's right
[26:36] because they got born again ain't gonna
[26:37] go back and do it again nope that's
[26:39] right you mean you don't never make
[26:40] mistake every day every hour your
[26:43] Prophet did too so he's the one that
[26:44] said it
[26:46] with the mistakes of a Christian is not
[26:49] the sin of a sinner right
[26:53] it's mistakes of a human being
[26:55] problems troubles
[26:58] getting caught in the devil's trap
[27:01] right
[27:02] but quickly repent amen why because down
[27:06] inside of there if something condemns
[27:08] you you know what I'm talking about
[27:11] the body and spirit of you you go find
[27:13] you another church
[27:15] a little okay for you to do that
[27:18] right amen and this message
[27:22] you got to imagine divorce problem just
[27:25] go down around just get in there you
[27:27] know connect up your little internet
[27:28] things and listen You'll find you
[27:30] somebody to tell you okay
[27:33] well brother Dale you won't do it no I'm
[27:35] not unless God tells me
[27:37] but his word tells me whether or not I'm
[27:39] okay
[27:43] but you can do anything you want to
[27:46] be a believer in this message
[27:50] right
[27:52] typical just in body and spirit
[27:56] it's not in my soul
[27:59] David set my soul on the fact of the old
[28:02] God
[28:04] now he could do that without the new
[28:06] birth
[28:09] what would be our problem with anyone
[28:17] you mean just because you wouldn't get
[28:19] caught doing what you do or something
[28:21] that you will go ahead and do it
[28:23] but you're going to keep from doing it
[28:24] because you're afraid you get caught
[28:29] right
[28:31] you can hit a thing happen one time
[28:34] um
[28:36] Dean's son's daughter uh son's wife
[28:39] and uh you know I just preach on this
[28:43] and I just said it one day the pope had
[28:45] she happened to be here I said if you
[28:47] want that drink you know in fact you
[28:48] can't stand it without it you might as
[28:50] well go and drink it
[28:52] brother would you give somebody a drink
[28:54] man come up with a what do you call it
[28:55] DTS is that the word for what are you
[28:58] going to do for him
[29:01] the only thing you can do is give him a
[29:02] little house y'all want to get him over
[29:03] it till he'd go somewhere else out
[29:05] well you sure know I know it so anyhow
[29:10] the lady said I told her husband said I
[29:14] want a beer
[29:16] I want something to drink
[29:18] and he said but honey we're not supposed
[29:21] to drink we're trying to do right she
[29:22] said you heard brother Dale he said if I
[29:25] wanted I might as well go ahead and
[29:26] drink it
[29:27] well she took what I said literally
[29:29] which was it was a truth
[29:32] you know
[29:34] you can keep yourself from doing wrong
[29:38] right because you're afraid of getting
[29:40] caught right
[29:43] and that's what ninety percent of
[29:44] Christianity does
[29:47] they're afraid of getting caught right
[29:49] or like I said they'll find them another
[29:51] church to go to that tells them it's
[29:53] okay
[29:56] come on they got homosexual preachers
[29:58] and everything else around the country
[30:01] they'll tell you everything's okie dokie
[30:04] but listen
[30:06] what must we do to be saved
[30:12] repeating everyone and be baptized in
[30:14] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[30:16] remission of sins and ye shall receive
[30:18] the gift of the Holy Ghost why if your
[30:20] repentance is genuine
[30:24] now it's easy to say I'm sorry go
[30:26] baptize me if you're offendency to
[30:28] genuine amen but that's where we miss it
[30:31] actually we look at it and we think well
[30:33] now I've done that but the Lord didn't
[30:35] save me it don't say immediately it says
[30:38] and you shall right and that's right
[30:42] you shall
[30:44] so if in the time of the shell which
[30:46] could be like me two years
[30:49] Amen Brother Gary one year
[30:55] like if you turn and go back what you
[30:58] prove
[31:01] you see salvation is in the soul amen
[31:03] because that's the real you that's what
[31:06] I've been driving at amen
[31:09] that's where salvation begins
[31:13] he's in that soul
[31:18] man we'll get around to it later where
[31:20] it says it's the earnest of our
[31:21] inheritance right you know the prophet
[31:23] said your soul is not complete yet it's
[31:26] only got the earnest right amen he's got
[31:30] to have a growth development it's got to
[31:31] have a I'm going on
[31:34] and that's kind of what we're going to
[31:36] be dealing with tonight all right
[31:39] but do you understand
[31:42] somebody comes along and they say well
[31:44] you know I want to be a Christian well
[31:47] come to our church
[31:51] right yep all right get baptized
[31:54] correctly
[31:57] oh that's well and good
[31:59] the worst of salvation
[32:01] right right that's right
[32:04] I believe in Deliverance
[32:06] I don't believe in quitting right
[32:08] you quit smoking you're gonna go right
[32:11] back and start smoking again amen you
[32:14] quit drinking you're going to go right
[32:15] back and drink again
[32:17] right why because you can't control it
[32:20] the devil is stronger than you are
[32:25] go to the Lord
[32:28] is it Lord
[32:30] I don't want to do that
[32:32] may you help me
[32:35] and watch you come on the scene
[32:37] help me Lord but I don't want to do it
[32:40] all right I want to be delivered amen
[32:43] you know that's why I believe in the
[32:45] total Deliverance
[32:47] amen what we need to do then listen is
[32:51] to get the one inside of us
[32:56] and the quitting will be on because of
[32:59] him
[33:03] well how do I do that repent be baptized
[33:06] in the name of Jesus Christ release the
[33:07] sin and you shall receive the gift of
[33:09] the Holy Ghost all right he said well
[33:11] I've done that all right I wanted to
[33:12] flip you in jail what must I do to be
[33:14] saved
[33:15] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and I
[33:17] shall be saved
[33:20] now that believing dire is not just well
[33:23] I believe
[33:25] my brother around says you go down there
[33:27] to get a drunk going down the road and
[33:28] he's you know you ask him so if you
[33:31] believe Jesus Christ
[33:36] get born again all right man that's what
[33:38] I'm trying to say because that's where
[33:39] the birth takes place he's in the soul
[33:42] amen
[33:44] amen see we try to conquer the body
[33:47] right
[33:49] it's honorable to quit things
[33:54] but run around City women said you can
[33:56] have a dress drag in the ground yeah
[33:58] yeah ain't no righteousness man
[34:08] but you get bored again
[34:10] it'll take care of everything
[34:13] that's my brother Dale's lucky is
[34:15] because I know what salvation is
[34:20] well you're just not a good pastor I'll
[34:22] agree with you
[34:24] not just what I am
[34:26] you tell me whether I'm right or wrong
[34:27] right
[34:31] see we try to deal with people to get
[34:34] them to us to a situation A Doctrine and
[34:37] Prophet what did he say he said I don't
[34:39] believe we're getting them to Christ
[34:46] he said I don't believe we're getting
[34:47] them to Christ
[34:49] because we're getting them to a doctor
[34:50] him
[34:52] that's great well then brother there you
[34:54] think it's all right and he's going to
[34:55] do that yeah you lost
[34:57] all right
[34:59] don't tell me you're saved and doing it
[35:01] you're lost
[35:06] well then I don't let you know plain
[35:08] enough where I stand
[35:10] you're going to tell me but I can't help
[35:11] it I do this I do that I can't help it
[35:13] you're lost
[35:15] wait a minute you need to be born again
[35:19] that New Birth has to begin in the show
[35:23] now watch that as we go along in the
[35:25] message
[35:26] see that new birth begins in the soul
[35:29] that's right that's why did you know the
[35:32] way that I believe it see then when
[35:35] you're born again
[35:39] in your soul is your theophany which is
[35:42] an upward going
[35:44] right
[35:47] before then you've got a Celestial form
[35:49] you can call it a theophany just don't
[35:51] carry it on over to a theophthy of
[35:54] Eternity right because you can't have an
[35:56] eternal Center
[36:00] basically for The Sinner in theophany
[36:04] lining up for a Christian Realm
[36:07] all right
[36:09] but you see
[36:12] just get born again and take care of
[36:14] itself in The Soul Man see big get saved
[36:18] first and get yourself saved and then
[36:21] apply it to your family
[36:24] don't know if I could just get my kids
[36:27] in church
[36:28] and then you lay out
[36:32] don't talk to me that's right too old
[36:34] I'm sorry
[36:35] you see a mom and daddy and they're
[36:37] goofing off and they don't go to church
[36:38] but every so often they just go
[36:40] sometimes special events or maybe every
[36:42] once in a while when you think you need
[36:44] to well I know you know what the kid's
[36:45] going to be the same way
[36:47] you know that kids don't have to
[36:48] overcome his mom and daddy
[36:50] to be able to go to church all the time
[36:52] because his mom and daddy says it's okay
[36:54] yeah
[36:55] we don't have to go to church ever
[36:57] service
[37:01] not that Lord have more amen
[37:03] especially in this day that's right
[37:07] you know in this day we ought to be
[37:09] having seven days a week Services amen
[37:13] oh well we'll see there you prove your
[37:16] loss right you don't want to come to
[37:18] church seven days you would sure go
[37:22] to the world I'm selling days
[37:26] and worldly events
[37:32] see then we prove where's your digging
[37:34] at
[37:35] we think salvation is right here
[37:38] well I don't go out and do them things
[37:42] now I like what the the colored ladies
[37:45] hit
[37:46] she said I ain't what I want to be and
[37:48] ain't what I want to be something like
[37:49] this but ain't what it used to be that's
[37:52] right she coughing somewhere something
[37:54] took over and she'd come she'd made a
[37:56] move amen all right that's salvation you
[37:58] got troubles Drive
[38:02] says you get borned again he said the
[38:04] devil turned over a gun he's got on you
[38:07] you know what you know what fool you
[38:10] before then
[38:12] so you see the world you want to steal
[38:14] me
[38:17] especially in this day right right when
[38:20] we're dealing with the change of this
[38:22] body right this is not the age to just
[38:25] go to church be good
[38:27] right it's the age of the Redemption of
[38:30] the body amen
[38:31] so we got a problem
[38:33] struggle
[38:35] right
[38:36] but what you gonna do is quit
[38:39] but now what's your point of what I'm
[38:41] trying to get to
[38:43] we've been over and over about the soul
[38:45] of God being the real you
[38:49] whether you're a sinner or a saint it's
[38:52] still the real you
[38:54] and it lives on no matter what right
[38:57] even after death all right
[39:00] see the sinner has a place to go to we
[39:03] have a place to go to right
[39:06] but let me just ask you something
[39:09] you know that when you was a sinner and
[39:11] I was a sinner you know what we was
[39:12] doing
[39:15] you really know what we were doing as
[39:17] sinners
[39:18] we were building us a house to go to a
[39:20] tabernacle right
[39:23] right yep
[39:27] yep come on that's why you loved it
[39:30] but you were not building a house now
[39:32] and out on the on the ground out there
[39:34] somewhere you know that ain't the
[39:36] Tabernacle that Paul was speaking of you
[39:38] know
[39:40] it's this Tabernacle amen
[39:44] our Dwelling Place
[39:46] we serve the devil right amen you know
[39:49] no problems with it
[39:52] I've watched them at General Motors I
[39:55] watched them in the world and the things
[39:56] of people
[39:59] and they come to work man
[40:05] you know what I wanted to do I know what
[40:07] I mean
[40:08] I wanted to take two big old cans and
[40:11] just crush them together
[40:17] see because they've been out all night
[40:19] drunk you've been there
[40:22] you wouldn't want nobody crashing the
[40:24] can around you would you
[40:28] but you know what next night you'll go
[40:29] right back and do it again you know what
[40:31] you're doing you're building your house
[40:33] to go to yep
[40:35] that's what I mean by the downward pool
[40:37] the prophet said one is going downward
[40:40] one is going upward right all right now
[40:44] I thought we believed as Christians
[40:49] now I'm getting down to something so
[40:50] listen
[40:54] that Jesus said in John 14
[40:58] I go to prepare place for you
[41:03] and if I go to prepare a place for you
[41:05] I'll come and receive you again unto
[41:07] myself
[41:10] now where did he go
[41:12] is he up in heaven
[41:14] when Hammers and Nails building a supply
[41:20] well now why does everybody think your
[41:22] soul is up in heaven or you see often is
[41:24] up in heaven right
[41:26] right that's what the basics of the
[41:27] message believe that your theophany is
[41:29] up in the oven somewhere
[41:33] but I thought Jesus went up and come
[41:36] right back inside of the person
[41:41] am I wrong
[41:43] you know
[41:45] Am I Wrong Jesus said I go to prepare a
[41:48] place for you
[41:51] you know he's building this place
[41:54] we build our own going down right right
[41:58] we supply all the material the devil
[42:01] needed amen
[42:02] Amen to build us a good house to live in
[42:04] down in hell all right all right A.D
[42:08] sugar honey anything you want to call it
[42:12] but it was a downward pull the prophet
[42:14] said
[42:16] but he said you get born again it starts
[42:18] an upward pull amen why because Jesus is
[42:23] building us a place to go to
[42:26] but where's he at inside of you all
[42:29] right where
[42:32] because you're in your body
[42:36] is he just an anointing upon your spirit
[42:41] or is the new birth in the soul
[42:45] see him the Christian is different from
[42:47] the center because in the center we
[42:49] would we were doing everything ourselves
[42:51] to go down we were trying to you know
[42:53] that said you got to go over the cross
[42:54] to get to hell that's right
[42:58] he said it's hard to go to hell
[43:00] because you had to get over the crowd
[43:05] so we sure did love the world didn't we
[43:12] but now we have someone inside of us
[43:17] that is building us a place to go to
[43:24] building National
[43:27] if we die
[43:30] right amen we have one lady
[43:34] right
[43:35] here's what we read in Corinthians
[43:40] feet Jesus Christ came back on the day
[43:43] of Pentecost
[43:45] you remember the other day now into what
[43:47] now in the form of the baptism of the
[43:50] Holy Ghost the soul of God came back on
[43:53] the death Pentecost
[43:55] to start building us a place to go amen
[43:59] so then it's all the building that's on
[44:01] the inside
[44:04] right amen right the workers on the
[44:07] inside
[44:09] now like I said if we act out here in
[44:11] these bodies and spirits and things like
[44:13] that if we act like the devil then the
[44:15] devil's on the inside so forget it amen
[44:20] that's why I said I don't believe in
[44:22] being good I believe in getting born
[44:23] again and let God come and live in our
[44:25] hearts and alive
[44:27] it'll take care of us
[44:31] but I can keep myself from doing wrong
[44:35] right amen yes
[44:39] I can keep myself from doing wrong
[44:45] see he came back into the man in the
[44:50] form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:52] to give the new birth
[44:56] listen now which is not the birth of the
[44:59] body our spirit but it's the birth and
[45:02] the Soul see then your soul is your
[45:05] theophany amen
[45:09] now that we read it that's only the
[45:11] earnest
[45:13] we'll get to that on another message
[45:17] go then write a random old paragraph 80
[45:19] or page 80 of the Hebrew Book and I
[45:22] tried my best to get you to see for 40
[45:24] years
[45:25] he said your soul is your theology
[45:30] no no no no no we got one up yonder
[45:36] well is Jesus up there working or where
[45:39] is he working right man
[45:41] that's right
[45:45] now according to the Bible he's gone to
[45:47] prepare a place for us he's up there
[45:49] working
[45:53] I even thought your Prophet said
[45:55] that the future home will be built
[45:59] because of your desires
[46:02] that's right is that true
[46:06] he said some people like mountains some
[46:08] people like valleys
[46:10] he's a little bit though thank you Lord
[46:13] God it's according to your desire
[46:16] he said what about if you could build a
[46:18] house
[46:20] you know
[46:22] that's your wife you know you could come
[46:23] and say well honey why do you want here
[46:25] why you won't die and it's just to all
[46:27] be there
[46:28] he said but he's going to prepare a
[46:31] place to live way on a greater needle
[46:33] house
[46:34] all right
[46:35] see when you're born again
[46:39] you start an upward pull instead of a
[46:42] downward pull
[46:44] in the same Soul right
[46:48] amen people of the message they say oh
[46:50] we get a new soul
[46:51] remember
[46:53] the quote get a New Soul
[46:55] was before the prophet or when the
[46:57] prophet was bringing it Body Spirit our
[47:01] body Soul spirit amen
[47:06] see we do get a new
[47:08] Spirit right Ezekiel says 36.
[47:12] you don't say we get in your soul
[47:14] but that was the Two Sold options you
[47:16] should get a New Soul
[47:19] then I hear it and the people of the
[47:20] message and they said they called it
[47:21] chains of the Soul
[47:24] all kind of things come off of that you
[47:27] know of doctrines but it's the same
[47:29] message
[47:31] for the rest of it wasn't your soul that
[47:34] died
[47:36] right
[47:38] he said it was the nature of your soul
[47:44] you said
[47:47] so was the nature
[47:50] that's what I told the man up in Jeff
[47:52] one time sitting there talking to him I
[47:53] said
[47:54] but around and said the nature of your
[47:56] soul is God if you're born again if not
[47:58] it's of the world he said how could a
[48:01] nature have a nature I said argue with
[48:03] the prophet
[48:07] he said this nature of your soul
[48:11] that's what I was trying to get you to
[48:12] see
[48:14] and we say the souls just the nature of
[48:16] spirit no it's not just the nature of
[48:17] the spirit right
[48:20] Satan took our soul
[48:23] and gave us a nature his own right God
[48:28] by the new birth comes inside and drive
[48:31] that nature out
[48:33] read future home
[48:35] page 15. the unclean Spirit goes out
[48:39] amen God came down and drove out that
[48:42] unclean Spirit right and it comes and
[48:45] dwells in that soul
[48:47] making our soul Eternal I didn't bring
[48:49] it on things but but I said don't get it
[48:52] on the next mansion He said that makes
[48:53] us as persons together
[48:57] you know you got no problem saying that
[48:59] God in your soul made you persons
[49:01] together
[49:05] your soul
[49:08] you remember the other day when we were
[49:10] bringing out
[49:11] said Adam was body and spirit and then
[49:15] just put a soul in there he'd be gone
[49:22] don't destroy the soul
[49:26] only God can do that
[49:30] the soul is a real you and God starts
[49:33] right in that soul
[49:37] mother New Birth
[49:40] all right
[49:43] clean Spirit out amen and covet and
[49:46] dwelling in
[49:48] see now when that unclaimed Spirit goes
[49:51] out we get new desires that's where the
[49:54] trouble
[49:55] when the unclaimed Spirit goes out of a
[49:57] man that gets new desires right
[50:00] see everybody say it then I'm saved
[50:01] because my desires change
[50:03] I used to love this but I don't anymore
[50:08] he said well when you preach I I can't
[50:12] find out whether I'm saved or lost
[50:15] well it gives you good reason to pray
[50:18] amen amen all right talk to God about it
[50:22] amen
[50:24] until he shows you what the truth is
[50:33] see salvation then starts in the soul
[50:35] making that Soul Eternal by the new
[50:39] birth and what is the new birth
[50:45] come on how many years have I been
[50:47] preaching to you what is a new birth
[50:49] the birth of the word amen
[50:54] you said what's the baptism now you can
[50:55] have the baptism about the daily life
[50:57] die and go to hell yeah that's right
[51:01] the new birth is the birth of the word
[51:03] he was the word right
[51:06] and if it's his soul coming and giving
[51:08] our soul eternal life
[51:12] it was he
[51:14] was his soul his theophany
[51:18] come on how many quotes do you need
[51:21] it is so histiochneous person of his
[51:24] being went to hell to preach to the soul
[51:26] in prison how many do you need
[51:29] to believe your Prophet is the one that
[51:31] said it Jesus's soul went to hell and
[51:33] preached to those souls in prison amen
[51:36] he didn't go down there as a spirit form
[51:38] to just look at him and they didn't even
[51:40] know he was around they knew who he was
[51:43] that's right
[51:47] as soon as you birthday is the birth of
[51:49] the word according to Romans 10 7 Faith
[51:52] cometh by hearing
[51:54] and hearing
[51:57] by the word
[51:58] amen so how do you start the New Birth
[52:00] by hearing the word
[52:02] oh I was just sitting out somewhere and
[52:03] all at once I just got saved
[52:05] man that's
[52:07] you've got to hear the word first you
[52:09] show me anybody in the Bible who's ever
[52:10] saved without hearing the word first
[52:14] right Philippian Jaguar what must I do
[52:17] they have any calls what must we do they
[52:20] heard the word it convicted them
[52:23] right
[52:25] that's right that's why a lot of people
[52:27] are not saved they're never convicted
[52:29] they're convinced
[52:32] that they need to do something else
[52:34] but around says you become sympathetic
[52:40] that's what a lot of people do they
[52:41] become sympathetic
[52:46] see God then
[52:48] by way of the new birth
[52:51] brains you and I part of his own life
[52:56] just like we did and covered the last
[52:59] message of 126 and 27 with Genesis
[53:02] that Adam received a part of God's life
[53:06] amen
[53:08] amen and his soul exists theophany
[53:16] he received part of Eternal part of
[53:18] God's life
[53:19] you and I receive part of God's life
[53:22] see the empathy is the soul of God or in
[53:27] other words the only form of God that's
[53:29] eternal
[53:30] I'm talking about an eternal fee off me
[53:32] I'm not talking about now just there's
[53:34] somebody to go to I'm talking about
[53:37] an eternal fee off me amen and there's
[53:39] only one Eternal right
[53:42] all right now if I was you I take a
[53:44] little pencil right in front of me show
[53:46] me the right notes right down
[53:48] right now
[53:50] there's only one eternal right
[53:56] but it can't be a whole lot of eternals
[54:02] the prophet said we start eternal life
[54:04] right here in the altar
[54:12] salvation there
[54:15] that's right we went through that
[54:19] now watch
[54:21] that's number six on your notes
[54:24] um paragraph 70 of manifest the sons of
[54:26] God he said you begin your eternal life
[54:30] right here at the altar amen
[54:35] that's where you begin eternal life
[54:36] right here talk
[54:39] now this is one I really like look at
[54:41] number seven on your notes
[54:44] paragraph 88 who is this male Chesney
[54:48] you left the Whirl in all of them things
[54:52] what did he say
[54:56] he said you heard look what's on the
[54:58] line
[55:00] he said you heard from your theosity
[55:03] right
[55:08] well
[55:10] I got a telephone call and the Lord
[55:13] called me from heaven and told me that I
[55:15] had some uh
[55:17] what did he tell you you had
[55:22] if you heard from you theophany you
[55:25] would have to have some form of
[55:26] connection
[55:28] right amen did you get that yeah
[55:32] I just now got it so I hope you did
[55:36] you have to have some form of connection
[55:39] sure
[55:43] then if it's not connected to the
[55:46] eternal life in you where it's connected
[55:48] to
[55:50] eternity can only come to Eternity right
[55:55] all right so keep in mind what we're
[55:57] saying that eternal life
[56:01] see then the real you at the new birth
[56:03] begins to develop by you eating the word
[56:09] and that started your upward
[56:13] agree
[56:19] I wrote it like this you say all that
[56:21] sounds so good brother Dale but I
[56:23] thought my theophany was up in heaven
[56:27] hey
[56:31] so now let's while we're at Dad if
[56:34] that's what you're thinking
[56:35] come on down to number eight on your
[56:37] notes expectations and look where your
[56:40] Prophet says
[56:42] that were now
[56:44] in Heavenly places is that what the
[56:47] scripture says
[56:51] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[56:55] already resurrected sitting in Heavenly
[56:59] places
[57:08] so now if you're saying that it's in
[57:11] Heavenly places
[57:15] then you're not saying it's your soul is
[57:17] in heaven
[57:19] right
[57:21] it hasn't left the body
[57:24] it's in the body right
[57:29] and if it's in the body then Heavenly
[57:31] places must have come here amen that's
[57:34] right that's right
[57:40] are we waiting to get to heaven to get
[57:42] eternal life
[57:45] or does our eternal life begins here
[57:49] see we can't even believe that and then
[57:51] turn around and say oh boy bless God one
[57:53] of these days this body is going to be
[57:54] changed
[57:55] some more we gonna do
[57:57] it you say yeah but you just gotta start
[57:59] eternal life in the soul I don't know
[58:01] about that
[58:05] but why not
[58:08] I thought we believed in Jesus Christ
[58:10] that the message I just previously
[58:12] preached and she said you enjoyed that
[58:14] having a nurse guess these times
[58:17] righteousness and peace
[58:21] push together
[58:23] in Jesus Christ
[58:26] and then by the new birth it's in you
[58:28] and me
[58:29] right right
[58:30] Heaven and Earth has kissed each other
[58:33] because you're not you United with him
[58:35] in the new birth that's right
[58:37] are you following me
[58:44] see I thought
[58:47] that we were already by the new birth
[58:50] resurrected and sitting in Heavenly
[58:52] place
[58:57] look at where he put it on questions and
[58:59] answers number nine on your notes read
[59:01] down to there where he said
[59:04] that you were already translated
[59:12] into Heavenly places
[59:17] already translated
[59:21] I thought we believe the soul was
[59:24] redeemed page 49 future home but we're
[59:27] waiting the Redemption of the body right
[59:31] I thought we believe we received eternal
[59:33] life in the new birth
[59:42] did we start our eternal life here right
[59:44] see that's what's going to take us there
[59:49] do we want this whole body to go there
[59:52] this body is going to go there because
[59:54] of what's inside of it that's right
[59:58] right
[59:59] all right
[1:00:02] okay already in Heavenly places look at
[1:00:06] number 11.
[1:00:07] Heavenly places brother Brown said what
[1:00:10] is it he said the believer's position in
[1:00:12] Christ
[1:00:16] the believer's position in Christ
[1:00:20] is Heavenly places
[1:00:24] when you receive the new birth that soul
[1:00:26] went into eternal life
[1:00:28] or became eternal
[1:00:31] because it's not Eternal you didn't get
[1:00:33] the new birth
[1:00:36] see we want to try to make it some kind
[1:00:37] of anointing when I said that while ago
[1:00:39] we only had the earnest of it you know
[1:00:41] what I'm talking about
[1:00:43] you got to add Faith Works or knowledge
[1:00:45] temperate faith has gone in this worldly
[1:00:47] kindness and all that got on to
[1:00:49] that's why we're here
[1:00:52] and that's going to bring us to a change
[1:00:53] in the body
[1:00:56] so it's only an Earnest when you get to
[1:00:57] New Birth
[1:00:59] I've got to the quotes laying on my desk
[1:01:05] would you say but brother Dale
[1:01:08] so go ahead and read number 13 while
[1:01:10] you're at it
[1:01:21] paragraph 22 God's only provided a place
[1:01:23] of worship 1965 11 28 in the morning
[1:01:26] service
[1:01:27] you helped me because I used to have an
[1:01:29] idea when a person died this their just
[1:01:32] their soul went off
[1:01:37] but when he quoted now who's he
[1:01:43] remember the he that's quoting this to
[1:01:46] him was that he that quoted to him when
[1:01:48] he was beyond the curtain of time and
[1:01:51] was questioning the situation and the
[1:01:54] angel of the Lord said this is Souls
[1:01:57] under the altar crying how long
[1:02:01] Angel the Lord referred to souls under
[1:02:03] the altar
[1:02:06] hmm
[1:02:08] when he quoted that to me that if this
[1:02:11] Earthly Tabernacle of our habitation be
[1:02:14] we already have one
[1:02:17] amen
[1:02:20] and we've got to have everything in
[1:02:22] trees to make a Perfection see and
[1:02:26] there's one body here
[1:02:31] then that body dire which is the
[1:02:33] celestial body
[1:02:36] that's what he's saying right and then
[1:02:38] the glorified body in the resurrection
[1:02:40] makes it complete
[1:02:43] now
[1:02:47] but brother Dale
[1:02:49] the prophet says we already have one
[1:02:51] amen the day you receive the new word
[1:02:55] you start eternal life in your soul
[1:03:01] and the positive of God's mind
[1:03:03] is then and in view right amen
[1:03:08] that's right
[1:03:10] that's why I love the scripture like it
[1:03:12] is so let's read it
[1:03:16] second Corinthians 5 let's read it
[1:03:19] see what it says
[1:03:28] for we know that if
[1:03:31] that if is past tense
[1:03:34] right
[1:03:35] that is
[1:03:39] that's past tense that if
[1:03:42] our Earthly House of this Tabernacle
[1:03:45] were
[1:03:48] hey
[1:03:50] dissolved
[1:03:53] we have a building of God
[1:03:56] a house not made with hands
[1:04:01] eternal
[1:04:02] in the heavens
[1:04:05] amen
[1:04:08] no
[1:04:11] if you die you step right over beyond
[1:04:13] the curtain of time right
[1:04:15] around and saw those people there right
[1:04:17] and they were in their theophanese
[1:04:20] he said they were
[1:04:23] and what was their theophany their soul
[1:04:25] right because the angel said this is
[1:04:27] sold under the altar
[1:04:32] the angel of God to referred to brother
[1:04:34] run these are sold under the altar now
[1:04:36] remember when he went to hell
[1:04:41] when the Lord Jesus Christ went to hell
[1:04:43] he saw souls
[1:04:45] in hell
[1:04:48] right right
[1:04:50] and when brother Brandon went beyond the
[1:04:51] curtain of time
[1:04:53] he saw Souls
[1:04:56] amen people
[1:04:57] that he could feel
[1:05:01] that he could hear that he could talk to
[1:05:06] not just folks floating around
[1:05:09] they were in their theophany body
[1:05:12] agree
[1:05:15] and it says we have a tabernacle
[1:05:19] and they see Turtle into heaven
[1:05:23] now maybe I shouldn't be so much to
[1:05:26] bring out things but I really like to
[1:05:27] bring them out to prove a point
[1:05:31] if that's not talking about your soul
[1:05:33] then that means you've got an eternal
[1:05:35] body somewhere
[1:05:37] a human body
[1:05:39] eternal
[1:05:40] come on
[1:05:42] did you get what I said
[1:05:45] you get it brother Gary
[1:05:48] if we have a tabernacle
[1:05:51] and that's a human body
[1:05:54] let me see turtle in the heavens
[1:05:59] so while we need a change for
[1:06:06] eign
[1:06:17] just like Jesus said I go to prepare you
[1:06:21] a tabernacle
[1:06:24] is that what he's saying oh no brother
[1:06:25] they only said a Dwelling Place well
[1:06:31] he said he went to perverse of Dwelling
[1:06:33] Place
[1:06:35] he went up come right back down into the
[1:06:37] soul to prepare Dwelling Place a
[1:06:39] tabernacle
[1:06:42] a dwelling place is a tabernacle and
[1:06:45] it's not talking about your physical
[1:06:47] body
[1:06:50] is talking about your theophany
[1:06:53] now remember the only difference in the
[1:06:56] way that we come in the way Jesus Jesus
[1:06:58] come a fool in morphe theophany body
[1:07:02] right
[1:07:03] and stood back there and said let there
[1:07:05] be and create it all things
[1:07:07] well we only received
[1:07:09] it in a part
[1:07:13] we only get a part of eternal life now
[1:07:16] part of eternal life don't mean that
[1:07:18] that there's a lot of it that ain't
[1:07:20] eternal
[1:07:22] that doesn't mean that it just simply is
[1:07:24] stating the fact we don't get all of God
[1:07:27] Jesus had all of God
[1:07:30] he was all of God
[1:07:32] but it takes all of us putting the parts
[1:07:34] together to make God you agree
[1:07:40] but you see
[1:07:41] sure the minute I die
[1:07:46] that's a prophet said it starts off as a
[1:07:49] little trickle so then it becomes a
[1:07:51] little small stream he said after a
[1:07:53] while it becomes a river and he said
[1:07:55] actor while it becomes an ocean and he
[1:07:56] says you're standing in the presence of
[1:07:58] God
[1:08:00] that's the way he describes it
[1:08:04] and that profit beyond the curtain of
[1:08:06] time he saw Souls under the altar
[1:08:08] right
[1:08:11] you know what they look like
[1:08:15] what they look like on Earth
[1:08:18] you know that he recognized his wife
[1:08:22] and you know that one of them was still
[1:08:24] on earth when he recognized the other
[1:08:26] one that one took him by one arm one the
[1:08:28] other one in another in a form that he's
[1:08:29] describing it
[1:08:33] you know he knew all about that
[1:08:35] like brother Stephen Wilson I know
[1:08:37] weights brought it out too said one
[1:08:39] times a good point you know that Sharon
[1:08:42] hope or what a name would hope that she
[1:08:44] was 18 months old when she passed on
[1:08:48] but when brother Brown saw her she was a
[1:08:50] full grown woman amen
[1:08:53] amen
[1:08:55] she then stepped into her theophany
[1:08:59] ain't gonna be no babies in heaven
[1:09:03] they ain't gonna be no old people either
[1:09:07] old age be gone
[1:09:11] we don't want to get a new body do we we
[1:09:14] want this body redeemed amen we don't
[1:09:16] want to get a New Soul do we
[1:09:22] that's what I'm explaining that's why
[1:09:24] that scripture says that
[1:09:27] we know that if our Earthly House of
[1:09:31] this Tabernacle were dissolved
[1:09:34] now he's not talking about this human
[1:09:36] body
[1:09:39] because if it was then you you would
[1:09:41] have to go down to the Life part of it
[1:09:43] and say that the body would be Eternal
[1:09:45] in heaven
[1:09:47] the body's not in heaven
[1:09:51] the body's in the grave wrote around his
[1:09:53] body feeling in the casket up here in
[1:09:55] Jeffersonville Indiana right
[1:10:03] so that's not the body that you're
[1:10:05] talking about
[1:10:08] that'll come forth in the resurrection
[1:10:11] into a glorified state
[1:10:13] the body I'm concerned with is the soul
[1:10:16] that's within us
[1:10:18] we heard from our theophany when we
[1:10:20] received the new birth
[1:10:24] the prophet said we become the word here
[1:10:28] he said Jesus was the word and a full
[1:10:30] word in morphe body he said we become
[1:10:33] the word here
[1:10:35] as we eat the word
[1:10:40] you said well brother Dale
[1:10:42] people say that you don't believe that
[1:10:44] we've got a body well you better get
[1:10:47] make sure you read the scripture
[1:10:48] correctly because it says you have one
[1:10:51] eternal in the heavens
[1:10:54] now here's my point
[1:10:56] if you have eternal life in the Soul by
[1:10:59] the new birth
[1:11:01] is there another
[1:11:03] eternal life waiting somewhere for you
[1:11:06] and brother Brown said is there any such
[1:11:09] thing as to eternal life remember the
[1:11:12] other day
[1:11:13] he said you couldn't answer that could
[1:11:16] you he said because it only won now a
[1:11:19] year back to where you're supposed to
[1:11:20] wrote that down while ago
[1:11:22] only one eternal life
[1:11:26] right
[1:11:29] you understand what the prophet is
[1:11:30] saying you understand what the Bible is
[1:11:32] saying I'm standing right here
[1:11:38] Body Spirit and soul
[1:11:40] my heart quits beating
[1:11:43] in just a Split Second
[1:11:46] even faster than that right
[1:11:48] my soul is there it's not here
[1:11:54] well because eternal life starts here
[1:11:57] there's the key that I want you to keep
[1:11:59] on your mind
[1:12:00] to remember
[1:12:02] the Old Testament people
[1:12:05] could not enter into that form of
[1:12:07] eternal life amen they could be anointed
[1:12:11] they could do great things
[1:12:14] that they could not have eternal life in
[1:12:17] their soul that's right amen
[1:12:20] because it takes the new birth to have
[1:12:22] eternal life in your soul or if you've
[1:12:24] got to go by the grave and come up now
[1:12:28] brother random says
[1:12:32] in Matthew 25 I mean that where's that
[1:12:36] Matthew wanted
[1:12:37] Matthew 17 excuse me let me get
[1:12:39] scripture right
[1:12:41] he said Moses and Elijah was there in
[1:12:44] their theophany
[1:12:47] you remember that
[1:12:50] you know what it looked like Moses and
[1:12:52] Elijah
[1:12:53] you know why because that was in their
[1:12:56] their soul not their natural body
[1:13:01] yep
[1:13:02] that was in our show amen
[1:13:04] see they had went on to their
[1:13:06] inheritance
[1:13:09] then they could stand there
[1:13:11] I ain't never said those Old Testament
[1:13:13] Saints didn't have no inheritance don't
[1:13:15] ever think anything like that don't you
[1:13:17] ever think that I've ever degraded Those
[1:13:19] Old Testament Saints which you better
[1:13:21] remember one thing they're called
[1:13:22] servants right
[1:13:24] right yes sir
[1:13:26] they're not called children
[1:13:28] it takes the new birth to be a child of
[1:13:31] God
[1:13:34] those were servants 144
[1:13:37] 000 that will even get eternal life
[1:13:39] after we leave here the Bible called I'm
[1:13:42] sure your Prophet said they will be our
[1:13:45] servants
[1:13:47] in the millennium
[1:13:50] servants
[1:13:53] a lot to receive in the new birth
[1:13:57] because the new birth makes you a child
[1:13:59] of God hear it
[1:14:02] nothing but in spirit but in your soul
[1:14:07] okay
[1:14:09] now if I'm a sinner and my heart quits
[1:14:11] feeding I'm going to where my body is
[1:14:14] being provided right
[1:14:17] I'm going to The Fifth Dimension Center
[1:14:20] day
[1:14:22] but if I'm a Christian
[1:14:25] and I die
[1:14:27] I just step right over there beyond the
[1:14:29] curtain of time
[1:14:30] and it's not a way off of younger
[1:14:33] that's what we all think
[1:14:36] that one of these days we're gonna have
[1:14:37] to make a long jump and run and go away
[1:14:39] up
[1:14:40] the prophet said it's 20 feet away to
[1:14:43] slant now you've explained that
[1:14:46] people have gone Haywire trying to
[1:14:48] figure out 20 feet at a slant
[1:14:51] my slant was it 45 degrees 33 degrees 60
[1:14:55] degrees what slang
[1:15:01] well you're worried about a slant for it
[1:15:03] in other words another dementia right
[1:15:06] right you step out of this Dimension
[1:15:08] into another dimension right but your
[1:15:09] body doesn't go there it goes to the
[1:15:11] Grave
[1:15:13] all right
[1:15:15] but one day
[1:15:18] you'll come back together here right
[1:15:19] right
[1:15:21] but you see we don't even have to do
[1:15:23] that
[1:15:25] wig stand right here
[1:15:27] be changed in a moment
[1:15:31] because negative and positive means
[1:15:35] partial becomes perfect amen
[1:15:38] amen Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the
[1:15:41] believer's position
[1:15:45] amen what do you think about it come on
[1:15:50] come on brother
[1:15:51] what do you think about it
[1:15:53] well I've always just believed in my
[1:15:55] theophany was up yonder I never said it
[1:15:57] wasn't that's the positive of God's mind
[1:16:00] right
[1:16:03] if there's a headstone the prophet would
[1:16:05] talk about and you get the new birth of
[1:16:06] Faith then that headstone is what's
[1:16:08] pulling you right
[1:16:11] the positive of God's mind is pulling
[1:16:13] you but you know the day Martin Luther
[1:16:16] begin to preach so just show me about
[1:16:19] faith
[1:16:20] he reached his positive position
[1:16:24] he had to go by the grave because there
[1:16:26] was nowhere else for him to go
[1:16:30] right right
[1:16:31] when Wesley began to preach
[1:16:33] sanctification
[1:16:35] when he reached the place there was
[1:16:37] nowhere for him to go
[1:16:40] there was no message to take him to a
[1:16:42] change when the Pentecostals received
[1:16:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the
[1:16:46] Zeus tree
[1:16:47] and they reached their place
[1:16:49] there's nowhere to go
[1:16:51] but then your steps of profit according
[1:16:53] to
[1:16:54] Leviticus
[1:16:56] 25 8. I believe it is
[1:16:59] verse 7 7 is 49 here come a prophet and
[1:17:02] a 49 on the South Church age
[1:17:06] proclaiming that we could step into
[1:17:08] eternal life
[1:17:11] but you know what you've got to have
[1:17:13] eternal life to go for eternal life is
[1:17:15] why you don't have to eternal life you
[1:17:18] only have one eternal life and your
[1:17:21] eternal life begins in the new birth and
[1:17:24] is completed when all of this is over
[1:17:25] with
[1:17:27] it eternity eternity then
[1:17:30] you can't have no more than eternity
[1:17:32] there's only one eternity
[1:17:34] there's only one Eternal must stand
[1:17:36] together what we got bro 103.
[1:17:57] foreign
[1:18:41] thing to happen
[1:18:46] Tom shout
[1:18:48] I could tell you things I had seen
[1:18:53] God in a church
[1:19:09] or anything I said I'm not free
[1:19:13] because it didn't accept Jesus Christ
[1:19:16] the first
[1:19:18] of the word
[1:19:21] and when he said that that
[1:19:24] one
[1:19:28] person is real
[1:19:35] Brian how loud you see
[1:19:39] Thanksgiving birth personate all of them
[1:19:44] and then we can't be the only
[1:19:45] problem
[1:19:47] s
[1:19:50] and they go on the basis of coming into
[1:19:52] this message gave me a new birth
[1:19:58] oh
[1:20:03] brother different
[1:20:06] I'm here if you're
[1:20:08] viewers until
[1:20:11] the new Earth
[1:20:23] God you are real you
[1:20:28] can use
[1:20:30] it no if I did anything
[1:20:37] help me I'll go straighten it up
[1:20:49] something smart every time I can get a
[1:20:51] travel I meant it
[1:20:54] go straight
[1:21:00] into all the ones that just became knees
[1:21:08] oh God in dreams
[1:21:25] if your mind go es real
[1:21:32] God is pretty bad
[1:21:38] I guess that's why I preached like I
[1:21:40] could do something awake experience he
[1:21:42] gave me I believe God is real full time
[1:21:45] so I'm not talking about something
[1:21:47] that's not real
[1:21:53] didn't they say I'm leaving that today
[1:21:55] amen
[1:21:58] so not to say I know I got the Holy
[1:22:00] Ghost because I believe the message
[1:22:03] I never said that right
[1:22:06] but for two years I read and studied I
[1:22:09] just rejected my family
[1:22:11] all I've done was work the doorbell and
[1:22:13] just cried and prayed out before God
[1:22:17] read and that's when I was reading six
[1:22:18] books a day and listening to two tapes
[1:22:24] but you see I knew that it wasn't a new
[1:22:25] bird
[1:22:29] the brother mode was not the kind of
[1:22:32] person to say brother Dale you got to
[1:22:33] quit this and you got to quit that
[1:22:36] thank God I run into him and not a lot
[1:22:38] of people because a lot of people would
[1:22:40] have said like one brother I said to him
[1:22:42] he said what do you mean you believe the
[1:22:43] message
[1:22:45] he said yeah and the devil believes it
[1:22:47] too
[1:22:48] absolutely I'm really Gary sitting back
[1:22:51] here behind us when he told him but he
[1:22:52] knows what I told him
[1:22:55] I said Brother Gary you're trying your
[1:22:58] best to figure out what the Holy Ghost
[1:23:00] is and stop it you're trying to find it
[1:23:03] through whatever you could do or not do
[1:23:05] whatever stop it
[1:23:07] yeah I should just simply get down and
[1:23:09] pray and say God give me the Holy Ghost
[1:23:11] because you promised it
[1:23:16] a phone call
[1:23:19] and he said it's over
[1:23:21] amen
[1:23:25] see because the new birth is a birth
[1:23:27] word
[1:23:30] and that way they can't take it out of
[1:23:32] you that's right you take my Bible you
[1:23:34] can take the prophet's message you can
[1:23:35] destroy everything but you can't destroy
[1:23:37] what's inside of me amen amen because
[1:23:42] that's where I am that's why I believe
[1:23:43] your soul then when you're born again
[1:23:46] he brings eternal life to you here puts
[1:23:49] you in Heavenly places
[1:23:54] because eternal life come here
[1:23:56] well what's dark the positive of God's
[1:23:59] mind
[1:24:00] waiting for me to reach that place
[1:24:03] and if I die before the change come
[1:24:06] don't say it brother deals are messed up
[1:24:08] no I'll never taught you nothing like
[1:24:09] that
[1:24:10] I've never said there was any disgrace
[1:24:13] in dying going by the grave
[1:24:15] just say he reached the place God saw he
[1:24:18] would reach that was it that's right and
[1:24:21] it was over with and I'll be just as
[1:24:23] happy
[1:24:25] the prophet said you just go to sleep
[1:24:28] and said you wake up and she might take
[1:24:29] in a nap
[1:24:30] anyway
[1:24:32] just be standing right back there
