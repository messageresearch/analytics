[9:38] scripture Revelations
[9:42] 1 1
[9:46] through3 the revelation of Jesus Christ
[9:48] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[9:51] servants things which must shortly come
[9:53] to pass and S he sent and signified it
[9:56] by his Angel and to his servant John who
[9:59] our record of the word of God and of the
[10:01] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[10:03] things that he saw blessed is he that
[10:06] readeth and they that hear the words of
[10:07] this prophecy and keep those things
[10:09] which are written our end for the time
[10:12] is at hand all right first Peter then 1
[10:18] ver9 receiving the end of your faith
[10:21] even the salvation of your souls of
[10:24] which salvation the prophets have
[10:26] inquired and searched diligently who
[10:29] prophesied of the grace that should come
[10:31] unto them searching what or what manner
[10:34] of time the spirit of Christ which
[10:37] within them did signify when it
[10:39] testified beforehand the sufferings of
[10:41] Christ and the glory that should follow
[10:44] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[10:46] themselves but unto us they did Minister
[10:48] these the things which are now reported
[10:51] unto you by them that have preached the
[10:54] gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent
[10:57] down from heaven which things the Angels
[11:00] desire to look into wherefore gir up the
[11:03] loins of your mind be sober and hope to
[11:06] the end for the grace that is to be
[11:08] brought brought to to unto you at the
[11:12] revelation of Jesus Christ you may be
[11:15] seated the Lord add his Blessing to the
[11:17] reading of the
[11:18] word
[11:27] and brother Joe gave me a thing so go
[11:30] ahead and pull up uh we want to read
[11:32] Revelations 5 cuz that's where we're at
[11:35] and brother Joe gave me a quote while
[11:37] ago that you know is a very good one you
[11:42] make a lot of statements you know and
[11:43] then you find out brother ROM said these
[11:45] things and you know you've heard them
[11:46] somewhere down the line before you know
[11:49] and uh the brother there your face is
[11:52] very very for meor
[11:54] see I'm talking about you brother The
[11:57] Visitor what's your name my name's uh
[12:00] brother Dan Roberts I'm from be Delaware
[12:03] all right okay glad to have you with us
[12:05] and you got to PR for me your face I
[12:07] don't know mean maybe we run in
[12:09] somewhere together again but we
[12:11] appreciate it but we you know we firmly
[12:14] believe that God sent a prophet in the
[12:15] end time so when we read these things
[12:17] you'll know that what we believe we
[12:19] don't believe that he was God but we
[12:21] believe God sent a prophet to us to
[12:24] speak to us the word of God Amen all
[12:26] right but now that saying let's read
[12:30] this from what the prophet I mean the
[12:32] Bible has to say now this is where we're
[12:34] at in Revelations
[12:36] 5 and I saw on the right hand of him
[12:38] that sat on the throne a book written
[12:40] within and on the backside sealed with
[12:42] Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel
[12:44] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[12:46] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[12:48] seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor
[12:50] in Earth neither under the Earth was
[12:52] able to open the book neither to look
[12:54] their own now remember it's looking for
[12:56] a kinsman redeemer amen right that's
[13:00] right and I we much because no man see
[13:02] it's not not an animal not a goat or a c
[13:05] or as we read it the minute a lamb would
[13:07] come forth it would have to be a man
[13:10] because no man was found worthy to open
[13:13] and to read the book neither to look
[13:15] their own and one of the elders said
[13:17] unto me weep not behold the lon of the
[13:19] tribe of Judah the root of David ha
[13:21] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[13:23] the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and
[13:26] low in the midst of the throne and of
[13:28] the four be and in the midst of the
[13:29] elders to the lamb as that had been
[13:31] slain having seven horns and seven eyes
[13:34] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[13:36] forth into all the Earth and he came and
[13:39] took the book out of the right hand of
[13:41] him that sat upon the throne amen now
[13:46] that's where we've been dealing with is
[13:47] trying to uh get an understanding to see
[13:51] these things and to follow their
[13:54] end now we have studied this and found
[13:59] out one thing for sure as I said it's
[14:01] not a a
[14:04] lamb the Bible says it's brother you
[14:06] know remember John he turned around and
[14:08] said Behold the Lamb of God that takes
[14:10] away the sin of the world when he was
[14:12] introducing Jesus Christ amen and so we
[14:14] know that's the lamb that we're looking
[14:16] for and all but we're trying to
[14:19] understand how it is to come up about in
[14:23] uh our day because the Bible has to be
[14:26] personal to you and I all right now we
[14:29] read in in uh and we've been over this
[14:32] and over in there in Revelations
[14:35] 1 that it's a revelation that God to
[14:38] give to Jesus to give to John you know
[14:40] to show into his Angel well that's not
[14:43] trinitarianism because that has no
[14:45] reflection whatsoever it's what would be
[14:48] used in the form of understanding in the
[14:50] Greek of imorph right e n m o r p h e IM
[14:56] morphe amen which means change changing
[14:59] your form that's right are something
[15:01] that can't be
[15:03] seen and then once it's I'll read that
[15:06] in just a minute but once it's open then
[15:08] you can see it amen and so then you know
[15:11] the the entire Bible is the revelation
[15:15] of Jesus Christ that's right revealing
[15:18] Christ to each one of us and looking
[15:21] back in the Old Testament you find the
[15:23] Christ you find who that was who it was
[15:25] back there that could tell Moses a
[15:27] better way of doing something when Moses
[15:30] was about to you know talking about the
[15:33] the the people and God was fixing to
[15:35] destroy them and he said if you destroy
[15:36] them destroy me right that was Christ in
[15:39] Moses so you look back in the Old
[15:41] Testament you look down through you find
[15:43] Christ Christ the anointing the anointed
[15:47] you know all right then when he came
[15:49] into
[15:50] flesh the it was the Lord Jesus
[15:54] Christ giv him the full benefit of the
[15:57] title of his name name and everything
[16:00] because father is not a name Holy Ghost
[16:03] is not a name son is not a name so who
[16:06] is it it's the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[16:08] all right the Jehovah the old you know
[16:12] Jehovah Jehovah of the old became Jesus
[16:15] Christ all right you didn't see any more
[16:19] Jehovah of the old now you can see
[16:21] references throughout the gospels about
[16:24] the father speaking and the things but
[16:26] remember you're looking at what we would
[16:29] call in our day the acts of a play
[16:31] that's right you know the scen of a play
[16:34] and that's what we've given the
[16:36] definition there from from the prophet
[16:38] of many times to you that chapter 5 is
[16:42] of Revelation is not a verse by verse do
[16:45] it it's a scene it's it's a it it's it's
[16:48] a uh preparing for the opening of the
[16:51] seals over in Revelation 61 getting the
[16:55] lamb in the right position getting
[16:57] everything set in and seeing it then we
[17:00] can see that truly it is a an
[17:03] understanding of one true and living God
[17:06] because we don't believe the the Trinity
[17:08] now we don't believe the Oneness right
[17:10] which is like your finger and Jesus they
[17:13] say would be the LI the imorph of God
[17:16] and we don't believe that because we
[17:17] believe the bride is the final imorphia
[17:19] in the Gentile
[17:21] dispensation and then when we leave out
[17:23] of here there'll be two witnesses come
[17:25] to Israel right and 144,000 taken out
[17:29] and they will be IM morphe of God or God
[17:32] using them God revealing himself through
[17:35] someone right see the body we we know
[17:38] for certain wasn't God right it was a
[17:41] creation according to Hebrews 10:5 a
[17:43] body thou H has prepared me all right
[17:45] but that Soul and Spirit that was within
[17:48] that body was almighty God or you you
[17:50] really messed up somewhere because Jesus
[17:52] said I and my father are one right all
[17:55] right then you know he said if you Se Me
[17:58] you've seen the father going through
[18:00] this the gospels so we're we're not
[18:02] Oneness and we're not Trinity that's
[18:04] right we're in the middle of those
[18:06] things trying to understand the the real
[18:09] truth of one true and living God Amen
[18:11] see Father Son and Holy Ghost I'm a
[18:13] father I'm a son I'm a human I'm a
[18:15] pastor I'm a a husband I'm a you know a
[18:18] granddaddy and a great granddaddy and
[18:20] all but it's just one of me yeah but
[18:22] I've got many ways of expressing myself
[18:25] right amen all right then to my kids I
[18:28] I'm not their husband right right MH
[18:32] that's a different form right right I'm
[18:35] a husband to my wife all right see then
[18:38] that way I'm keeping my forms correctly
[18:41] or in morphes or
[18:43] changing see and and that's what
[18:45] happened I married I became a husband
[18:48] but then through my wife and the and the
[18:50] lifetime and the doings of of life I
[18:53] became a father well see that's that's
[18:56] not another person no
[18:59] that's just another form of God as we'd
[19:01] say in trying to keep it straight of our
[19:03] understanding of the one true and living
[19:05] God God changed his form in many ways he
[19:08] appeared in many ways back there he
[19:11] appeared like the mzd the Bible calls
[19:13] him a man amen meled Paul did in his
[19:16] writings Y and and he said he was a man
[19:19] amen right but that man was God Amen cuz
[19:22] he had no beginning of days or ending of
[19:24] life right amen so then it had to be
[19:26] almighty God see then it would come down
[19:28] to to bring in the understanding of one
[19:30] God to where you and I can comprehend it
[19:34] and walk there in see then that's why we
[19:36] then uh I want to speak on it the Lord
[19:38] willing this coming Thursday I didn't
[19:40] get to go down this past Thursday to
[19:42] brother Collins say we had to call it
[19:44] off cu the boy and girl that was wanting
[19:47] he was wanting us to witness to some was
[19:50] not going to be able to be there so
[19:51] we're going this kind Thursday so you
[19:53] just pray for us that Lord would bless
[19:55] us and they want us to speak a little on
[19:57] the on the god head and to speak on
[19:59] water baptism amen then that's why we
[20:02] believe in water baptism in the name of
[20:04] the Lord Jesus Christ amen not father
[20:07] Son and Holy Ghost Father Son and Holy
[20:09] Ghost is not a name that's right it's
[20:11] the Lord Jesus Christ all right so we
[20:13] believe in in that and trying to bring
[20:15] it down to understand but see
[20:18] Revelations 5 then is a
[20:22] preparing for Revelation 6 to where it
[20:26] says and the lamb open the first
[20:29] seal all right so there a preparation
[20:32] getting ready right we went through
[20:34] chapter uh 4 of seeing that John saw a
[20:39] door opened in
[20:42] heaven all right then he heard a voice
[20:46] calling him up then he went up and then
[20:49] he saw a
[20:50] throne and then he saw one sitting on
[20:53] the throne right he was seeing the acts
[20:56] of a play you know close a curtain put
[20:58] up a throne close a curtain put one on
[21:00] the throne it was being done to give
[21:04] understanding to where we would know and
[21:06] it was getting ready to where we could
[21:09] understand the opening of the word all
[21:11] right now in doing that then see each
[21:15] one of those was an imorph
[21:18] amen the door opened in heaven who's the
[21:20] door Jesus said I'm the door all right
[21:24] he was the door to heaven the only way
[21:26] to get to heaven is through Jesus Christ
[21:28] so that was in in morphy right all right
[21:32] then he saw a throne right all right
[21:34] where's the Throne of God you say well
[21:36] it's setting up there well that's true
[21:39] but right here in our hearts by the
[21:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right
[21:43] came the Father Strong into being right
[21:46] to fulfill what Jesus said in
[21:48] Revelations 3 about 22 know where he
[21:51] said he that overcomes will sit with me
[21:53] in my Throne as I have overcome and sit
[21:55] with my father in his throne right amen
[21:58] it's not two different Thrones it's a
[22:00] changing of an am morphe it's changing
[22:03] your form
[22:04] right when he was here on
[22:07] Earth he would speak of the son of man
[22:11] amen and see none of the writers
[22:13] understood those things you know they've
[22:16] done the best they could do right
[22:18] through the gospels but even in the the
[22:20] uh writing of the New
[22:23] Testament even the ones that wrote some
[22:26] more like John
[22:28] that had wrote the the uh writings there
[22:31] in John and spoke of the son of man but
[22:33] when he come to the Book of Revelations
[22:35] and wrote that he never mentioned the
[22:37] son of man other than one standing in
[22:39] the midst of the seven gold cany like un
[22:41] the son of
[22:42] man because that was
[22:45] withholding that was a form of God that
[22:47] man did not comprehend right they were
[22:50] looking for a
[22:52] messiah and they believe that the
[22:54] Messiah a lot of the Jews even today
[22:56] still believe the Messiah will be and
[22:58] they believe it will be a man sure amen
[23:00] you know that's right all right and
[23:02] believing it will be a man to bring the
[23:04] word unto him see then they couldn't see
[23:07] it though right dire because it was
[23:09] withholding from them am all right you
[23:13] see it's just a change a form so amen I
[23:16] hope everybody understands what I've
[23:17] been trying to do see the throne was a
[23:20] form of God that's in our heart one on
[23:23] the throne is the Lord Jesus Christ he's
[23:26] living now in our heart matching EX L
[23:28] what's in heaven cuz if what we're doing
[23:31] here doesn't match that we've got a
[23:33] problem you say well when I get up there
[23:35] to Heaven one of these days I'm going to
[23:37] see three Gods well you you're getting
[23:39] in the wrong place because there's not
[23:42] three Gods that's right there's one God
[23:44] manifested in many
[23:46] ways many forms many Amores changing his
[23:51] form to reveal himself to to the
[23:54] different generations and things that
[23:56] was to be done all right and see then we
[23:59] come on over into chapter 4 and we
[24:02] picked up the 24 Elders you know and we
[24:06] spoke about that the 24 Elders being
[24:09] what the 12 apostles and 12 Patriarchs
[24:12] amen and who was that that was Christ in
[24:14] the
[24:16] Patriarchs coming down you know and then
[24:19] it was Christ in the right 12 Apostles
[24:23] right coming down see bringing his word
[24:25] so that's another form of God that's
[24:27] another name morphe that was God showing
[24:30] himself in another way right all right
[24:32] then you come on down to we went through
[24:35] the rainbow the different things and we
[24:37] know what that is a covenant and and all
[24:40] and then we got up to chapter
[24:43] 5 and we started on that and it says
[24:45] that there was a throne you know chapter
[24:48] 5 that where we started reading there
[24:51] was one sitting on the throne and there
[24:53] was a book in the hand of the one
[24:55] sitting on the throne all right see
[24:59] now you're catching and picking up more
[25:01] and more of God changing his
[25:05] form all right we know the throne is in
[25:07] our hearts we know the one sitting on
[25:09] the throne is Christ in our hearts all
[25:11] right then the book we went through that
[25:13] that you and I are the book amen it was
[25:16] book the book the Lamb's Book of Life
[25:18] written before the foundation of the
[25:19] world Amen you know and that then would
[25:22] be the book that was in the hand of the
[25:23] one sitting on the throne right that's
[25:25] right and it would be the book that had
[25:27] to go back when mankind failed right
[25:30] there was no way for mankind to do
[25:32] anything once Adam and Eve sinned there
[25:35] was no way for God to bring that book
[25:37] forth and manifest it so he would have
[25:40] to do it down through time right you
[25:42] know all right then e he would come
[25:43] forth he would come into the uh Church
[25:46] ages then as we call it or start on the
[25:48] day of Pentecost and that would be the
[25:51] amorphia of God God living in his church
[25:54] living down through time showing himself
[25:57] for the different ages and and revealing
[26:00] himself in that form all right see then
[26:03] when the book is
[26:06] completed then that would be the end
[26:08] time or the finishing up of the ages
[26:10] right and you and I are that book right
[26:13] right that book is sealed up because you
[26:15] find it over in chapter 6 that there was
[26:18] seven seals on that book and they had to
[26:21] be broken by the
[26:23] lamb because that would be the only one
[26:25] and that's what we're we're want to get
[26:27] to today is to see that he's the only
[26:30] one worthy amen you know because there's
[26:33] no way for anybody else the proclamation
[26:36] went in heaven or brother around said it
[26:38] one time like this it was really great
[26:40] he said heaven was search and Earth was
[26:42] rsck right said you couldn't find nobody
[26:45] worthy right right all right now you
[26:47] could find some worthy but they hadn't
[26:49] changed their form right the lamb was
[26:53] there sitting on the throne right right
[26:57] amen
[26:58] that was the lamb sitting on the throne
[27:00] cuz he said I've overcome and sit with
[27:01] my father and his throne all right so
[27:04] that Throne being the baptism of the
[27:06] Holy Ghost then see down to the ages it
[27:08] could be made manifest and that Throne
[27:11] then is here today in our hearts and our
[27:15] lives you know living out because we're
[27:19] comparing this with what's dark that's
[27:21] right looking at seeing why because
[27:23] there's one thing for
[27:24] sure if you can't find it d how do you
[27:28] know what you got here right right
[27:31] amen but if you can see here comparing
[27:34] to dark right yes sir all right now you
[27:37] know you got to be getting close that's
[27:39] why I said then you come down here and
[27:41] you say well brother Dale I I believe in
[27:43] three Gods well then read me the Bible
[27:45] for it right
[27:47] right right I mean show me in the Bible
[27:50] where it says God and three persons
[27:51] Blessed Trinity yes Co equal and
[27:55] coeternal now want scripture M but I can
[27:59] show you where it says there's one
[28:01] sitting on the
[28:03] throne and say there was three Thrones
[28:06] right there's one sitting on the throne
[28:08] so you're Bel living one of your Gods if
[28:10] you you know got a trinity thought and
[28:12] that's just you know to help us all but
[28:16] think about it the lamb was in was there
[28:19] but not being seen right
[28:23] right because the lamb was on the
[28:26] throne
[28:27] yes well that's what happened because
[28:30] that's what the scripture says then he
[28:32] went to the right hand of the father
[28:33] right is that scripture see when he died
[28:36] he went to the right hand of the father
[28:38] and Steven when he looked up he saw him
[28:40] standing there we see that's like the
[28:42] brothers there the other day and we
[28:43] leaving Lord willing um the 30th to go
[28:47] to Florida and fish for a few days and
[28:49] the brother that was there you know and
[28:51] we've talked with
[28:53] him D he has a little bit and you just a
[28:56] few things and
[28:58] he was he he said well I'd always
[29:00] believe that that was Jesus standing up
[29:03] there the father said no here you
[29:07] know and I said yeah he said but you
[29:11] took that out of my mind
[29:13] tonight well you know what it took to
[29:15] get it out of his
[29:17] mind just a simple
[29:21] illustration that God see we think we
[29:24] try to explain all about how that he's
[29:27] just one person he's just he said when
[29:30] you said that God wouldn't send his son
[29:32] to die for our sins that's right he came
[29:35] himself y That's Right
[29:38] amen he said that sealed it from me he
[29:40] said I seen it CU you think about it
[29:43] would you send one of your kids to pay
[29:45] you know you got a debt to pay you got a
[29:47] somebody going to be killed today you
[29:49] said well okay go ahead now wa you you
[29:51] go I'm you know I'm going no no a good
[29:55] to father wouldn't do that that's right
[29:58] Amen Let see God didn't step in heaven
[30:00] and send a son no that's right amen he
[30:04] was living in that flesh called the son
[30:06] right
[30:07] amen he dwelt on Earth that's why he
[30:09] said if you seen me you've seen the
[30:12] father amen that's right cuz he was here
[30:15] upon Earth all right see then that's
[30:17] that's where it comes down to sometime a
[30:19] simple
[30:20] illustration will break forth a lot of
[30:23] things right so this one is worthy let's
[30:25] let's read what the prophet had to say
[30:27] here I don't know where Joe cut this did
[30:29] you capture this brother Joe the one you
[30:31] gave me anyhow I can read it to you this
[30:35] is taken from Revelation 5 part 2
[30:39] 19616 18 paragraph
[30:46] 131 and now when John wept we read there
[30:49] in the scripture that he wept because no
[30:50] man was worthy now someone as I said
[30:53] last week they said John wept because he
[30:56] could find
[30:57] nobody
[30:59] worthy it wasn't that watch him now so
[31:04] you'll find him saying that he couldn't
[31:05] find somebody worthy but listen to his
[31:08] explanation he wasn't that a man under
[31:12] the influence of the Holy Ghost wouldn't
[31:15] weep for
[31:17] that thought that it cuz he wasn't
[31:20] worthy the that's what people think John
[31:23] wouldn't thought he wasn't worthy
[31:26] right there's nobody
[31:29] worthy but he didn't weep because of
[31:33] that now listen but this quote with all
[31:36] the other quotes that goes with it I
[31:38] believe he was weeping for
[31:40] Joy because he had seen the whole Plan
[31:43] of Redemption was wrote in this book
[31:45] here
[31:47] right it wasn't because there wasn't
[31:49] nobody
[31:51] worthy because D stood a lamb right
[31:54] d was Worthy
[31:58] so he was weeping there he said Oh Glory
[32:00] to God listen to him directly when he
[32:03] goes to shouting he was weeping because
[32:06] he was happy right see now that doesn't
[32:10] change a point of thought that you would
[32:12] think about that he was thinking it was
[32:14] nobody worthy and that the lamb you know
[32:18] the lamb was there sitting on the throne
[32:21] right all right he climbed upon the
[32:23] throne and sat down he was there but he
[32:27] was not coming forth as the lamb right
[32:31] the one to be the
[32:33] Kinsman all right now we know what the
[32:36] kinsman redeemer is according to the
[32:37] Book of Ruth there was a requirement for
[32:39] a Kinsman to come forth amen
[32:42] Boaz he was going to do the right of
[32:45] kinsman but you know there was one
[32:47] closer kin to Ruth yeah right and see
[32:50] when that happened he had to wait until
[32:52] that man decided he didn't want to take
[32:54] that R all right then he could take the
[32:56] r and you know you and I were born kin
[32:58] folks to the devil whether we like it or
[33:00] not right we wasn't certainly born kin
[33:03] folks to God that's right amen now I
[33:06] hope you don't believe that amen this
[33:08] thing out here wasn't born kin folks to
[33:09] God this old nature that we had in ways
[33:12] was born kin folks to the
[33:14] devil but see then that man refused to
[33:18] pay the price or to take off his shoe
[33:20] and show the sign in the Book of Ruth
[33:23] and when it did Boaz was capable of
[33:25] taking it because he was the next one in
[33:28] line of kin it had to be somebody kin to
[33:31] you right amen all right so the Kinsman
[33:33] we found would had to be almighty God
[33:35] had to come down in flesh right that's
[33:37] right amen
[33:39] amen now you wouldn't be kin folks to
[33:41] God if Jesus wouldn't God himself
[33:45] right you say well no no no he's just
[33:47] he's my brother well that's right he's
[33:50] your
[33:50] brother but God was in that flesh that's
[33:53] right that's right God was in Christ
[33:55] reconciling the world unto himself
[33:57] scripture that's right all right in him
[33:59] the Bible said dwelt what the fullness
[34:01] of the godhead
[34:03] bodily all right so then looking at it
[34:07] we see the IM morphe is the way to look
[34:09] at it he's changing his form so I hope
[34:12] you was listening the way I gave it see
[34:14] then when you see him in these in the
[34:16] chapter 4 and now in chapter 5 you see
[34:20] him as he's changing his form amen he's
[34:23] going from one form to the other all
[34:26] right
[34:27] now and when we got to that part of the
[34:30] Kinsman we found something that was very
[34:35] odd all
[34:37] right this lamb that we read
[34:40] of was a funny looking
[34:43] lamb remember the Book of Revelation
[34:45] written in symbols
[34:47] right all you got to do is find out what
[34:50] the symbols are that's right right we
[34:53] know who the lamb
[34:55] is the Bible declar is the Lamb of God
[34:57] that takes away the sin of the world
[34:59] Amen the proclamation went forth and the
[35:02] elders said as we read there the Elder
[35:05] said behold the line of the tribe of
[35:08] Judah amen has prevailed to open the
[35:14] book and loose the Seven Seals well now
[35:17] who was the line of the tribe of Judah
[35:19] where did Jesus come from the tribe of
[35:21] Judah a lawgiver was to come from Judah
[35:23] as a promise in the scripture all right
[35:27] well then he was the line of the tribe
[35:29] of Judah right but when John introduced
[35:32] him upon Earth he said Behold the Lamb
[35:34] of God that takes away the sin of the
[35:36] world Amen right but lamb is Kinsman
[35:39] lamb is Redeemer right cuz that's what
[35:41] they gave in the Old Testament they
[35:43] never put a Lon on the altar no that's
[35:46] right for a sacrifice right right Lon is
[35:49] King yeah Lon is symbolic of King right
[35:54] all so when he's coming forth in the end
[35:57] time to take
[35:59] possession of you and I to walk off this
[36:01] Earth in a Rapture you know going away
[36:04] caught up whatever word you want to use
[36:06] word rapture is not in the Bible but it
[36:08] caught up
[36:09] is but see he will come forth he will
[36:12] become the line of the tribe of Judah
[36:13] amen because the millennial Reign that
[36:16] what Jesus was speaking of when he said
[36:18] he that overcometh will sit with me in
[36:20] my Throne the his throne is Promised the
[36:23] Throne of David in the Millennium right
[36:25] David's son was to Reign on his throne
[36:28] Solomon in the natural reigned on the
[36:30] throne of David you know but Jesus
[36:34] Christ will reign on the throne of David
[36:36] in the Millennium as the son of David
[36:39] because he came Son of God Son of Man
[36:41] son of David the Manifest himself you
[36:43] know to show us where we're at and
[36:46] what's going on all right see that will
[36:48] be his in morphe changing his form do
[36:51] Israel he'll be the son of David do you
[36:54] and I you know who he'll be
[36:58] he'll be our bridegroom yeah he'll be
[37:00] our husband that's right amen he he'll
[37:02] be our
[37:04] father all of our beings and whatever we
[37:06] have need of right and we'll be in a
[37:08] millennial Reign for a thousand years
[37:11] upon the Earth right you know to show
[37:14] that the sin curse is gone from Genesis
[37:16] all
[37:18] now but that blood of the lamb as first
[37:21] Peter called it 1 Peter 1:18 there calls
[37:25] it the blood of the Lamb
[37:27] amen all see I said John he said the
[37:30] Lamb of God he didn't say the lamb he
[37:33] said the Lamb of God right but then he
[37:35] would have to be in Redemption he'd have
[37:38] to remain a lamb right right see then
[37:42] when we come to where we're at now we
[37:44] come to the basis of seeing that he is
[37:47] now to be we got to see him as the Lamb
[37:50] of God that takes away the sin of the
[37:52] world Amen in other words our Revelation
[37:54] has got to come to the position to wor
[37:56] that we can see Jesus Christ truly as
[37:59] almighty God right that's right not a
[38:01] second person or a third person that's
[38:03] what the Catholic Church taught us yeah
[38:05] and US Baptist and Methodist and things
[38:07] swallowed it down and thought it was
[38:09] true until we begin to read the Bible
[38:11] for oursel amen yeah see and that's when
[38:14] I was even in the Baptist I would argue
[38:16] with them I said wait a minute my Bible
[38:18] says there's one God something wrong
[38:20] here you're saying it's three now show
[38:23] me where that's in the Bible Well father
[38:25] son holy I
[38:27] said Jesus said I my father one right he
[38:31] said I come in my father's
[38:34] name well you know the father's name
[38:36] would have to be Jesus amen right the
[38:38] only name he ever had on Earth y you
[38:41] remember they made it Jehovah in the Old
[38:43] Testament that wouldn't correct it's jvh
[38:45] V or jvh uever which one you want to use
[38:48] they could not pronounce it right there
[38:51] was no way there was no vow heart added
[38:53] you know enough to it to be able to
[38:55] bring it down to a word to comprehend
[38:57] call it they call it g Das o d God is
[39:03] the way the Jews were WR it you know but
[39:06] they know that that means something you
[39:07] remember Moses at the burning bush who
[39:09] am I going to say he said go down there
[39:11] and tell them the god of Abraham Isaac
[39:12] and
[39:15] Jacob he said okie
[39:17] dokie I believe in the god of Abraham
[39:20] Isaac and
[39:21] Jacob but they had a personal experience
[39:23] with you now who do I tell them
[39:27] is sending me right he said I am that I
[39:31] am that means ever present for
[39:34] eternity you know wasn't it odd that
[39:36] when Jesus come along he said before
[39:38] Abraham was I
[39:41] am that's right then on the Revelation
[39:43] you find I am the Alpha and Omega right
[39:47] same God
[39:49] Amen changing his form changing his
[39:52] under you know to where we could look at
[39:54] him right and the morphy
[39:57] to be able to understand it all right
[40:01] now what I want us to think about for
[40:03] just a
[40:06] minute
[40:08] is as we read there and I'm quoted it to
[40:12] you did John knew who who spoke to him
[40:17] yes when he saw that door open in heaven
[40:20] and he knew who that door was he wrote
[40:22] about it yes in his writings you know I
[40:24] am the door of the sheep folk right
[40:28] he heard the voice yes and he knew that
[40:31] voice because he' walked with him for
[40:33] three and 1 half
[40:35] years now get up the setting of what I'm
[40:38] talking
[40:39] about he knows about the Throne of
[40:43] God because by the time John comes to
[40:45] patas about 1895 R in
[40:48] there he done had the baptism of the
[40:51] Holy Ghost and somewhere in the
[40:55] 830s on the day of Pentecost right he
[40:59] knows God is real
[41:02] amen he's not looking for a
[41:05] god he's looking and seeing who that God
[41:09] is and he sees the throne and then when
[41:11] he comes to Revelations 5 he sees the
[41:13] one on the throne and the book in his
[41:17] hand he knows what those symbols mean
[41:21] cuz he was chosen to bring to be there
[41:23] you know yes like I said the Holy Ghost
[41:27] what 60 years or
[41:28] something he
[41:32] understands but
[41:34] yet he knows there must be something
[41:39] happened all right and no reference have
[41:42] we ever made or ever will make that
[41:46] there was a lamb back dire you know the
[41:50] die for our sins and there's got to be
[41:52] another lamb over here that would be
[41:54] contrary to the explanation I've been
[41:56] giving you but if we can see that that
[41:59] lamb back
[42:00] there was the form of God upon human
[42:04] flesh to be a Kinsman
[42:07] amen all right then we can see that same
[42:10] God come
[42:13] forth in the form of the
[42:18] Lamb no there a funny looking
[42:21] lamb right now John knew the
[42:25] lamb
[42:27] but what was odd to John was to look at
[42:29] the lamb when the Elder said the line of
[42:31] the tribe of Judah had prevailed when
[42:33] John looked you know we read chapter 5 a
[42:36] lamb came forth
[42:38] right as it had been
[42:42] slain now John knew that was the Lord
[42:45] Jesus Christ
[42:46] right that's right but what was the odd
[42:49] part was the symbolics it came forth or
[42:51] every how you say it the symbol y the
[42:54] lamb had seven horns y and seven eyes
[42:57] that's right now we just read that in
[42:59] the Bible chapter 5
[43:01] amen that's an oddl looking
[43:05] lamb and like I told you when we started
[43:07] this series we we've been through it
[43:09] many times before that people told us
[43:12] stay out of the Book of Revelations you
[43:13] can't understand
[43:15] it why
[43:19] not why not since God sent a prophet to
[43:23] show us what the symbols were and some
[43:25] of those symbols didn't have to be
[43:26] broken by the prophet that's right John
[43:29] you read even Scofield will tell you
[43:31] about this lamb he tells you all this
[43:33] here that talking from Revelations 5 he
[43:37] said the two visions are identical
[43:40] speaking from Daniel I'm talking what
[43:42] what scoffield wrote he said the
[43:44] Revelation adding that which was hidden
[43:47] from Daniel that the Kings and the
[43:49] priests of the church age are to be
[43:54] associated with the son of man
[43:56] the lamb that had been slain so they
[43:59] knew some of those
[44:01] things they could write about it see all
[44:05] right so John knew who this was but the
[44:08] symbol was the thing that he needed to
[44:10] have an understanding why would it have
[44:12] seven horns and seven eyes
[44:16] right and the the the Proclamation was
[44:20] was a man
[44:23] worthy when was a lamb Worthy
[44:27] right a goat or a horse or a dog or
[44:31] a whatever
[44:34] see it was was they was a a man
[44:40] worthy well John looked to see this
[44:44] man that had been
[44:48] slain and he saw he had seven horns and
[44:50] seven
[44:52] eyes all
[44:54] right now we went through that couple of
[45:00] services through the
[45:04] candlesticks that Ezekiel speaks of
[45:07] right through the candlesticks in the
[45:08] Book of Revelation chapter
[45:10] 1 and them and John explaining that the
[45:14] candlesticks is the
[45:16] ages you
[45:18] know the messengers to the ages right
[45:21] and then you read them in Chapter 2 you
[45:24] know
[45:26] pergam t f you know right and you read
[45:29] the ages all right so there's where the
[45:32] horns come from in the eyes with a
[45:36] messenger to each
[45:38] age all right see then you can see back
[45:42] here behind it we firmly believe in you
[45:44] know the ages as they come down look a
[45:47] lot of people don't like to talk about
[45:48] Luther and Wesley and all of them people
[45:50] but you know I do amen because they had
[45:54] a truth for their day that's right when
[45:56] Luther walked out there with a J you
[45:58] live by faith now that was God's word
[46:01] you either believ that or you didn't get
[46:03] into the kingdom of God on that day amen
[46:06] no amen see then Wesley coming along
[46:09] preaching
[46:11] sanctification would work today wouldn't
[46:13] it get in the Methodist Church and try
[46:14] to preach sanctification amen my
[46:16] brother's a Methodist preacher so every
[46:18] year they get together and all of them
[46:19] go down to the beach and they got this
[46:21] big old house that they rent and they
[46:23] lay out there on the beach and their
[46:24] bikinis and they there everything things
[46:26] in the world and and they have
[46:29] church you know go by and see them
[46:32] walking into the church for short s you
[46:33] know and all kind of thing John Wesley
[46:35] turn over in his grave and you know that
[46:37] may be one of these earthquakes around
[46:39] every once in a while maybe he's rolling
[46:41] over and over because of what he knows
[46:42] they're doing right all right not make a
[46:44] joke but this is a point that's
[46:47] right right you know that John Smith the
[46:49] founder of the Baptist prayed for the
[46:51] sins of the people so much until his
[46:53] wife would have to lead him to the
[46:54] breakfast table I'm quoting history and
[46:57] feed him his breakfast
[47:02] right those people were sincere people
[47:04] to that day that's right yes sir we
[47:06] firmly believe in what they T amen the
[47:08] truth of what they T not the Trinity
[47:10] Doctrine Martin Luther taught a trinity
[47:13] baptized the father son Holy Ghost and
[47:15] said the Jews were to be killed he said
[47:18] because he was not the end time Prophet
[47:20] or the one set aside he was the one to
[47:22] bring the Jud to live by faith right and
[47:24] God used that amen so those seven horns
[47:27] and seven eyes we found to be the ages
[47:29] and The Messengers bringing their
[47:31] message
[47:34] mhm to see if there was anything worthy
[47:36] that's
[47:38] right but now here's the point I want
[47:40] you to look at I Tred to make it the
[47:42] other
[47:43] day that why would it come forth why
[47:46] would it we know that that that happened
[47:49] we know what happened at Calvary John
[47:51] and them knew what happened at Calvary
[47:53] they knew what happened to you know uh
[47:55] of the day of Pentecost and the coming
[47:57] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost right
[47:59] all
[47:59] right well why would it come over in the
[48:01] Book of Revelation to be calling for a
[48:04] lion or a lamb me to
[48:09] one what would be the purpose in the end
[48:12] time why would the Book of Revelation
[48:14] not simply have been written that Jesus
[48:16] Christ come and paid the
[48:21] price cuz you see on the day of
[48:23] Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:25] came into the heart of man that's the
[48:27] Throne of God right all right now that's
[48:31] your new
[48:32] birth but you see even though the price
[48:35] was paid for full Redemption by Jesus
[48:37] Christ he's not going to come back in
[48:39] the end time get up on a cross and die
[48:42] again no right but it's understanding
[48:46] what he has
[48:50] done understanding what has taken place
[48:53] amen all right it's like it is over in
[48:58] Leviticus over in Leviticus you'll find
[49:01] the 16th chapter of Leviticus they have
[49:03] a mourning for the kill they have a
[49:05] feast right and they have a Mourning you
[49:09] know a crying out a sincere time for the
[49:12] killing of the feast because that would
[49:14] mean the killing of Jesus Christ at
[49:16] Calvary that would be the tops and the
[49:18] Shadows that's that Christ that we were
[49:20] speaking of but see then you get over
[49:22] about the 23rd chapter of politicus and
[49:26] you find they having another feast and
[49:29] another
[49:30] morning a sadness a time you know for
[49:34] and it looks like it's for another
[49:35] killing right but it's not right it's
[49:39] not a
[49:41] reking see right it's bringing it back
[49:45] to understand
[49:47] amen you understand read it sometime
[49:49] when you get a chain I I used to preach
[49:51] a lot out of the Old Testament see
[49:53] Leviticus he he he he show Show Jesus
[49:56] Christ is going to die on the cross now
[49:58] Moses messed it
[50:00] up when he smoked the rock because he
[50:03] was to speak to the Rock right that's
[50:06] right but that didn't make Jesus Christ
[50:08] to have to die again in the end time it
[50:11] made him to where that he would be
[50:12] crucified by the effects of the people
[50:15] in the end time that's what Moses was
[50:17] doing when he smoked the rock instead of
[50:18] speaking to it right you so that it
[50:21] would come in the end time when it would
[50:22] set up organized religions and things
[50:24] and Jesus Christ would be crucified
[50:26] openly right what not crucified fleshly
[50:29] not back on a tree
[50:31] right but he would have to come back as
[50:33] a lamb to understand and to be able to
[50:36] reveal to
[50:39] John we have to come back and show us
[50:41] something it was not a re killing
[50:44] Leviticus wasn't a rilling
[50:46] right it was killed one
[50:48] time but it was a morning for the
[50:52] kill he didn't they realize what had
[50:55] happened that's right you think it ain't
[50:56] going to be a mour one day of a kill
[50:59] when those Jews threw two witnesses not
[51:01] through Jesus standing there in flesh
[51:04] because he doesn't come to this earth
[51:06] until the Millennium we meet him in the
[51:07] a according to the Bible amen that's
[51:11] right don't you think them Jews are
[51:14] going to be mourning when they separate
[51:15] apart amen and cry for days and they say
[51:19] where did you get the nail prints in
[51:20] your hands he said I got them in the
[51:22] house of my friends amen Amen in other
[51:26] words I was crucified for you you
[51:29] rejected the r of sunship Y the Gentiles
[51:33] accepted it right they became a gentile
[51:36] dispensation which would mean Jews or
[51:38] anybody can come in amen MH and said it
[51:40] was set up to where that could come into
[51:42] being yes Lord said now I've come to you
[51:45] he's not standing there when they prince
[51:47] in his hands
[51:50] right come on he's speaking through two
[51:52] witnesses Moses and
[51:54] Elijah
[51:56] and they're telling them the truth of
[51:58] the gospel righten and that 144,000
[52:01] would be called
[52:02] out amen all right yes but see that's
[52:06] not
[52:08] a literal the Lord Jesus standing there
[52:10] right right but it's God in another form
[52:14] amen through two witnesses amen amen
[52:17] they are so close to God until God can
[52:19] speak right through them
[52:21] amen and bring down the plag Moses was
[52:25] so close to
[52:26] God until Moses they had to put a fail
[52:29] over Moses's face you remember that in
[52:31] the
[52:32] Bible the people couldn't even stand to
[52:35] look at him why he was so in in that
[52:38] presence of God he had become so much
[52:40] close to God until literally the prophet
[52:43] said one day like this he said when he
[52:44] stepped forth and brought his word he
[52:46] said he was God to the people right he
[52:49] said but when he step back he become
[52:54] Moses
[52:56] that's why Moses could get in trouble
[52:58] that Christ in Moses couldn't amen
[53:00] that's right right that one that was
[53:02] leading Moses couldn't do
[53:05] that why can't we see it then the amorph
[53:08] the changing of
[53:10] form he won't be there right through
[53:13] those two witnesses that's right he
[53:16] won't be standing there with them you
[53:17] know they're two standing here and he
[53:19] standing
[53:20] here
[53:21] no but they see what the Moses the
[53:25] preaches by the baptism of the Holy
[53:28] Ghost that they can can receive them and
[53:31] they receive it and they see that that's
[53:34] Christ and they say where'd you get the
[53:35] nail prints in other words who crucified
[53:37] you right you've been telling us now
[53:39] you've been preaching to us quite a
[53:41] while about somebody killing who killed
[53:43] him
[53:45] right he said I got in the house my
[53:47] friends right then they realized they
[53:50] were the one that killed him right you
[53:53] said no they W the one that's th000
[53:55] years come on get the
[53:57] story they realized that their people
[54:00] the Jews was the one that killed Jesus
[54:01] Christ right was no Romans
[54:05] Spar the Jews put Jesus Christ on the
[54:07] cross they had their own soldiers had
[54:09] their own Army and thing on guards of
[54:12] the altar they were the one that took
[54:13] Jesus to the Cross right the Romans was
[54:16] just standing by witnessing the things
[54:20] it was my sins and your sins that put
[54:22] him on the cross but come on Church get
[54:25] what I'm trying to say yes he won't be
[54:27] there with the two witnesses right he'll
[54:29] be there so much in them speaking
[54:31] through them by prophetic utterance
[54:34] until the people will think we have
[54:37] killed Jesus Christ we have killed our
[54:40] God that's right now we
[54:44] realize that we've missed the ride of
[54:47] sunship the Gentile dispensation has
[54:49] taken it all right now so is it in this
[54:52] end time if you get what I'm trying to
[54:54] say you'll see what I've been driving at
[54:56] yes in this end time we gave Ezekiel see
[54:59] it's not a reking it's a mourning for
[55:02] the kill okay we gave the two witnesses
[55:05] all right trying to give you an example
[55:08] the two witnesses actually show Jesus
[55:10] Christ so much until they they see him
[55:13] but not physically with this lamb that
[55:16] you
[55:17] see this lamb in the Book of
[55:22] Revelations looking at it D you might up
[55:25] but he's not here
[55:29] right he's not here the coral bodies
[55:33] there
[55:35] right but when John begins to see what's
[55:38] taking place he sees a lamb
[55:41] yes that come from and I gave you the
[55:44] quotes from The Prophet right came from
[55:46] the church
[55:47] ages he died son of
[55:50] man there was no way to kill God right
[55:54] what happened to Calvary then
[55:56] simple they took a man that God was
[55:59] living within and nailed him on a tree
[56:01] yes and God came out of that if they
[56:04] took you and nailed you on a tree and
[56:05] you as a Christian you know what would
[56:07] happened God would come out of you
[56:09] that's right is that true amen you can't
[56:13] kill
[56:14] God Amen so he became son of man that's
[56:18] right God in human flesh amen and paid
[56:22] the price yes when that Holy Ghost came
[56:25] out of him on the day of Pentecost it
[56:27] didn't come back son of
[56:29] man it came back Son of
[56:32] God y the New Birth the baptism of the
[56:35] Holy Ghost to come and live in our
[56:37] hearts right but in the end time it's
[56:39] promised to come back when the son of
[56:40] man is to be revealed Luke 17:30 right
[56:44] reveal word back in his bride again in
[56:45] the end time by the word amen
[56:48] amen are we tring together all the
[56:51] thoughts then
[56:52] amen I thought i' just take this today
[56:54] is a message from
[56:56] this the IM
[56:58] morphy the
[57:01] changing shows who's worthy
[57:04] amen he changed his
[57:07] form you know what form he's in now
[57:11] bride amen come on right bride
[57:18] form okay yep would he in Bride formed
[57:22] in Revelations one that's right that's
[57:26] right doesn't it say in Revelation 1113
[57:29] he saw one standing in the midst of the
[57:30] seven golden counter sticks which is a
[57:32] church ages one La unto the son of man
[57:35] he didn't say he was son of man he said
[57:36] one La un the son of man the Bible's
[57:38] perfectly right right but he's G about
[57:42] there in Revelation 113 G about the PS
[57:45] mhm
[57:48] no that's not a male form
[57:53] right this G about the PS that's a
[57:56] feminist form right that's
[58:00] right that was the Bride of Jesus Christ
[58:02] in Revelation let me put it correctly
[58:04] where you won't misunderstand me that
[58:06] was almighty God in that is almighty God
[58:09] in his church right amen we gave you the
[58:12] quote from the prophet of that where he
[58:13] saw him in Bride form
[58:16] right saw him in Bride
[58:20] form in the Book of Revelations
[58:23] 1 all right then we went to Revelation 4
[58:27] we talk about The Throne BL that's in
[58:30] your heart amen and Bride for then we
[58:32] saw one on the throne and that's the one
[58:34] on the throne in Your Heart Right Now by
[58:36] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but a book
[58:38] was in the hand and that's you and I
[58:40] because we are the booken this Bible is
[58:43] just a record of my name while I'm here
[58:45] my name Samuel it's way back over here
[58:47] so don't get confused it's not my name
[58:50] written in here like writing Samuel it's
[58:53] what is going on while I'm here is my
[58:56] name in the book right
[58:59] right all
[59:01] right then doing it that way Samuel
[59:04] might have been right for Old Testament
[59:05] but you don't find Samuel written in the
[59:07] New Testament you it had to have
[59:09] change Samuel's okay for an Old
[59:12] Testament Prophet but the new birth in
[59:14] the New Testament brings you from Samuel
[59:16] of the Old Testament to the New
[59:17] Testament Christ right right amen puts
[59:20] Christ in you the hope of glory as the
[59:22] Bible say we see this book is a record
[59:24] of the people yes the book that went
[59:27] back in the hand of the one sitting on
[59:28] the throne wouldn't a Thompson Chain or
[59:30] a Scofield or a you know right King
[59:32] James version
[59:34] right that's right it's a book of names
[59:37] amen that's simple a book of names amen
[59:41] but then when it was put down here for
[59:42] us to read it was made in a book form
[59:45] right then we believe in the King James
[59:48] version being the correct one right Amen
[59:51] to give us the correct understanding but
[59:52] I read all the others I've got all kind
[59:54] of transl
[59:55] and I check them to read and see if
[59:56] they're
[59:57] right but this book see so you find Paul
[1:00:02] in this
[1:00:03] book but you know Paul you know who he
[1:00:06] was before
[1:00:08] then it didn't work as a new testament
[1:00:11] person he had a good name in the Old
[1:00:12] Testament didn't he his name was
[1:00:15] Saul you remember and his name was
[1:00:18] changed to Paul why because he was
[1:00:21] becoming a Christian amen Saul is okay
[1:00:25] he's Old Testament guy but he didn't
[1:00:26] work too good in the New Testament he
[1:00:28] needed a new birth amen so Saul got a
[1:00:30] new birth and he's named Paul se's got a
[1:00:33] new birth and he's called Peter that's
[1:00:36] right see that's where when you and I
[1:00:38] receive the new birth we have a new name
[1:00:41] amen that's right our name now is
[1:00:43] Christian amen written in this book amen
[1:00:46] this book is a record of you and I upon
[1:00:49] the Earth amen you want to read it like
[1:00:51] we talking about the other day the Bible
[1:00:53] says back over in here here said when
[1:00:55] the towers
[1:00:57] fall well we just remember two airplanes
[1:00:59] going up there taking down two
[1:01:02] towers check that and see if it's not
[1:01:04] talking to the end time amen then one
[1:01:06] time it says that they found a scroll
[1:01:08] and they stood before the water
[1:01:10] gate and read the
[1:01:14] scroll we've had a water gate in our
[1:01:17] day and the word came before The Water
[1:01:21] Gate the word began to be revealed
[1:01:23] before they had Watergate and The Nixons
[1:01:25] and all these other who that guy you
[1:01:28] know but listen church trying to make
[1:01:31] the Bible personal to you and I right to
[1:01:34] see ourselves written in the
[1:01:37] book because that's the only way that'll
[1:01:39] ever do the prophet said it like this
[1:01:40] one time he said when the bride realizes
[1:01:42] who she is and once she's here
[1:01:45] far she'll be gone you know what we're
[1:01:49] here for we're here to conquer death
[1:01:52] right that's right amen
[1:01:55] is what I said a moment ago on the day
[1:01:56] of Pentecost it was only the baptism of
[1:01:58] the Holy Ghost come in the heart of man
[1:02:00] the body was claimed sure Jesus Christ
[1:02:04] shed his blood on this Earth to claim
[1:02:06] our bodies right amen but they was not
[1:02:09] taken possession right but the new birth
[1:02:11] came in the heart of man and took
[1:02:13] possession of the heart soul of man not
[1:02:16] a heart thumping gizzard soul of man I
[1:02:20] mean your being of who you are yes all
[1:02:24] right but see these bodies has got to be
[1:02:26] redeemed are we going to lean back to
[1:02:28] the organized religion so we going to
[1:02:30] get me a new one when I show me that in
[1:02:31] the
[1:02:34] Bible I mean I just want one scripture
[1:02:37] show we in the Bible right then we're
[1:02:38] going to get a new body the Bible said
[1:02:40] we have a body like un his glorious body
[1:02:42] that's
[1:02:47] right then Jesus stood there after his
[1:02:50] resurrection with nail prints in his
[1:02:52] hand y That's Right put your hand in
[1:02:55] here
[1:02:59] Thomas Resurrection is not replacement
[1:03:02] right that's right what goes down comes
[1:03:05] back up right amen thank God for the
[1:03:08] truth amen that's right see we just what
[1:03:11] we was organized religion I'm not
[1:03:13] throwing off from nobody we all come
[1:03:14] from there right we're just talking

[1:07:29] eyes now come on folks who was it that

[1:07:34] random we don't believe in that that
[1:07:36] deity right right the lamb come forth
[1:07:40] and took the
[1:07:42] book and Loos the seals
[1:07:45] right if you don't have the baptism of
[1:07:47] the Holy Ghost you don't know what's
[1:07:49] going on today you want scripture for it
[1:07:51] that's right no man can call Jesus the
[1:07:53] Christ except it be what the by the Holy
[1:07:56] Ghost amen yes sir and you stop any
[1:07:59] drunk riding up down the highway and you
[1:08:00] say can you say Jesus is the Christ
[1:08:03] Jesus is the Christ they don't mean
[1:08:05] they're saved that's where we Baptist
[1:08:07] was doing it I argued with them in when
[1:08:09] I was in the Baptist Church the Bible
[1:08:11] don't say he that believe it said he
[1:08:14] that believeth right right and his
[1:08:17] baptized shall be
[1:08:18] saved it don't say he that believe well
[1:08:21] all you got to do is believe but you Jud
[1:08:24] believed where's he at that's right
[1:08:26] that's
[1:08:28] right Judas had a Ministry cast out
[1:08:31] devil heal the sick and everything
[1:08:32] where's he at that's right that's
[1:08:36] right don't tell me he wasn't a
[1:08:39] Believer
[1:08:41] sure the Bible said he that believeth
[1:08:44] and is baptized shall be saved amen
[1:08:47] right you stop believing you don't
[1:08:50] believe that's
[1:08:52] right
[1:08:56] right we get the point of what I'm
[1:08:58] saying this lamb that I've been talking
[1:09:01] about if you excuse me if you read what
[1:09:04] I asked you the breach in the seal book
[1:09:07] you'll know the things that I'm saying
[1:09:08] is right
[1:09:10] right this lamb came
[1:09:14] forth and took the book climbed upon the
[1:09:17] throne and sat down in other words
[1:09:20] became the one sitting on the throne
[1:09:22] right who sitting on your Throne today
[1:09:24] that's right who's sitting on your heart
[1:09:27] Throne today that's right well I think
[1:09:29] it's a holy ghost it may be the father I
[1:09:31] don't know who it really is but you
[1:09:33] better find
[1:09:38] out if Jesus said I and my father are
[1:09:41] one you better start thinking
[1:09:43] right well now brother what it is is
[1:09:46] like you was husband and wife you and
[1:09:48] your wife one not that kind
[1:09:51] no come on
[1:09:54] not that
[1:09:57] kind come on we illustrate not that kind
[1:10:01] you see my
[1:10:05] wife you see
[1:10:08] me might still be on the video part of
[1:10:11] it but everybody sitting here they can't
[1:10:13] see me so that ain't right
[1:10:18] right husband and wife are just an
[1:10:20] example or a Ty right that's right but
[1:10:23] Jesus said if you seen me youve seen the
[1:10:26] father right
[1:10:28] amen that's right so then he lied if he
[1:10:31] wouldn't him that's right that's right
[1:10:33] no problem with saying those words right
[1:10:36] why because when you line it back up
[1:10:37] with the Bible you can see it's right
[1:10:39] right get my point now trying to get
[1:10:40] through in a hurry this lamb that comes
[1:10:43] forth is not a mortal Corporal human
[1:10:45] being to take the
[1:10:48] book that mortal Corporal human being
[1:10:51] has done come and done his part
[1:10:54] right it's not that mortal Corporal
[1:10:56] human being coming again
[1:11:02] right he's in another
[1:11:06] form but when he changes his form is it
[1:11:09] not the same
[1:11:13] God Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:11:16] manifestation
[1:11:18] right many manifestations of
[1:11:22] God I'm just not trying to preach to the
[1:11:24] brother back there right whether he's
[1:11:26] trinitarian or Oneness or what it is
[1:11:28] that's between him and the Lord right
[1:11:29] I'm talking to you church amen I'm
[1:11:32] trying to get you to see
[1:11:34] something go don't just sit there and
[1:11:36] say p it on back to the brother he ain't
[1:11:38] never heard this before he might have
[1:11:39] heard it a whole lot more than you have
[1:11:42] cuz he might have believed what he
[1:11:44] heard and some of you still ain't
[1:11:46] believing what what your
[1:11:50] ear when all of the years are preaching
[1:11:52] I've tried my best has to do it and you
[1:11:54] know it to preach it down to show it to
[1:11:57] you this lamb is not a Corporal coming
[1:12:00] forth of a human being right the Lamb of
[1:12:03] the Book of Revelations is not a it's a
[1:12:05] scene of an opening in a stage play

[1:12:29] I've been preaching it to
[1:12:31] you but see this is not a natural lamb
[1:12:34] that walks out
[1:12:36] there cuz he got seven horns and seven
[1:12:38] eyes be funny looking
[1:12:43] lamb John says or the writer there says

[1:12:49] Calvary where he paid the price this is
[1:12:53] getting ready to Redemption right these

[1:19:22] at a Corporal being this taken of the
[1:19:25] Lamb I hope you catch that part it's not
[1:19:28] a physical being it's not a Corporal
[1:19:30] being that takes the
[1:19:33] book it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:19:36] being revealed to his bride right and
[1:19:40] her becoming what he's revealing to her
[1:19:43] right that she can see who she
[1:19:46] is and then we're going to walk off you
[1:19:49] amen you Lord what that's correct there
[1:19:53] where is anywhere else to go we're not
[1:19:55] going to
[1:19:57] Israel they not Gentiles going to Israel
[1:19:59] they going to be two prophets they're
[1:20:00] Jews right amen they'll go to Israel oh
[1:20:03] there's a bunch of garbage in the
[1:20:04] message of who this and who that and
[1:20:06] what's trying to be something you know
[1:20:08] Gentile Prophet the Gentile bride and I
[1:20:10] never have agreed with it n because it'
[1:20:12] be two Jews they won't receive a gentile
[1:20:14] n that's right that's right they'll
[1:20:17] receive a Jew that's
[1:20:19] right when we was over there in Israel I
[1:20:21] rejoiced
[1:20:23] because knowing that Moses and Elijah
[1:20:26] would come to Israel after we leave and
[1:20:30] that Jewish god that did not believe in
[1:20:32] Jesus Christ but yet know more about
[1:20:34] Jesus Christ than most of you and me
[1:20:36] know he knowed everywhere Jesus Christ
[1:20:38] was ever been where he preached and what
[1:20:40] he
[1:20:44] done he said I believe told Brother
[1:20:47] George Smith I
[1:20:49] believe this man y'all called Elijah
[1:20:53] was the one that preceded the coming
[1:20:58] Messiah cuz you see those Jews believe
[1:21:01] Elijah will come before the Messiah
[1:21:04] comes sure absolutely they got a place
[1:21:06] sitting at their table they opened the
[1:21:08] door remember way preaching they open
[1:21:10] the door and all of their eatings when
[1:21:12] they get together they open the door and
[1:21:13] they leave a place and they believe that
[1:21:15] one day Elijah will walk in you know
[1:21:18] those Jews believe
[1:21:20] Elijah I'm quoting this Jewish man now
[1:21:24] he'll know where to put the temple right
[1:21:27] sure cuz there's an argument over where
[1:21:28] to put it they can't get it exactly
[1:21:31] right they you can't get it he said
[1:21:33] it'll be Elijah will'll have to
[1:21:35] come and show him to where with the
[1:21:37] temple
[1:21:39] yes that's right we're not looking at
[1:21:42] the wrong Elijah right we're looking at
[1:21:46] the
[1:21:47] what the fourth coming of Elijah is in
[1:21:50] our day right the fifth coming of Elijah
[1:21:53] to the Jews remember
[1:21:56] Elijah a double portion was up on Elisha
[1:21:59] of Elijah's Spirit John the Baptist com
[1:22:01] into power in the spirit of Elias or
[1:22:03] Elijah in the end time according to
[1:22:06] Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation
[1:22:11] 10:7 that there was to be an Elijah come
[1:22:14] to us and then there's to be two
[1:22:15] witnesses go to Israel right and there
[1:22:17] is you five times right of
[1:22:20] Grace see these things we're looking for
[1:22:23] them to be literal that's what I'm
