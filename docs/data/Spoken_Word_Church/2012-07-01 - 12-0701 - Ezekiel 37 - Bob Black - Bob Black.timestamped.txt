[0:05] hey we need one of those little things
[0:06] like this
[0:09] hey we need one of those little director
[0:11] things all
[0:15] right all right good morning everybody
[0:17] good morning good morning M morning
[0:22] teacher how are you I'm doing one doing
[0:26] well all right you need to speak up for
[0:28] the F all right um so last time we went
[0:32] through um the sins of R jeroboam and
[0:36] the history of the Israel church and
[0:38] talking a little bit about the
[0:39] birthright now this time we're going to
[0:42] jump over to Ezekiel
[0:45] 37 um but before I get into that going
[0:49] to do a little
[0:52] background which I kind of Drew on the
[0:54] board a little bit up here um to talk
[0:57] about the seven Church ages in the Old
[0:59] Testament the seven Church in the New
[1:01] Testament how that um
[1:04] the the spirit that was in the palor
[1:08] locus Kor
[1:10] caterpillar away the word in the Old
[1:12] Testament and the New Testament and then
[1:15] in Ezekiel 37 it talks about the four um
[1:19] the four stages of the of the church
[1:22] coming forth through Luther Wesley
[1:25] Pentecost and then the word being
[1:27] restored so um just to read a few quotes
[1:32] about I think about jeroboam how it
[1:35] started at Solomon everything the golden
[1:37] age uh everything's wonderful they have
[1:40] time to read and study the word and
[1:42] Worship the Lord and then uh idolatry
[1:45] comes in the picture and remember
[1:47] idolatry is spiritual adultery getting
[1:50] away from the full unadulterated word of
[1:53] God uh one word off will put you into
[1:57] spiritual adultery and then uh the
[2:00] the spirit of the devil ate away down
[2:04] until remember Elijah when at the time
[2:07] of Ahab brother said Ahab was the dark
[2:09] ages of the Old Testament Elijah said is
[2:12] there anybody left that still believes
[2:13] God and it looked like it was nobody
[2:16] else that s stood with him um but it was
[2:20] not just a few but 7,000 it seems like
[2:23] um that's that's actually a pretty big
[2:26] number 7,000 um so it it it may seem at
[2:30] times like there's nobody else preaching
[2:33] the word and believing but that God has
[2:35] his his little few little few
[2:38] flock so in the invasion of the United
[2:41] States in 1954 brother Rand said many
[2:44] times someone has said brother random
[2:46] why is it you always take the Old
[2:48] Testament and we talked uh a long while
[2:52] ago about dispensationalism
[2:53] dispensationalism is the the kind of
[2:56] part of that is that you can understand
[2:58] the New Testament from the old test that
[3:00] God reveals himself through scripture
[3:02] you can look at the things in the Old
[3:03] Testament you can look at the the
[3:06] Tabernacle in the wilderness and
[3:07] understand the new birth going through
[3:09] the outer core the in core the holy of
[3:10] holies and the three pools and you can
[3:13] understand um what happens in the New
[3:16] Testament by looking at what happened in
[3:18] the Old Testament as they went through
[3:19] the Dark
[3:21] Ages nearly always taking a TT you go
[3:24] back to the Old Testament I do it
[3:25] because I like typology and he said in
[3:28] the Old Testament if the Lord willing
[3:29] make in the coming Services I'd like to
[3:31] show how that the seven Church ages
[3:32] typed out in the Old Testament how that
[3:34] they began just exactly like at the
[3:36] beginning of the church ages of the
[3:37] Gentile church and went right down
[3:39] through a similar Dark Age and come out
[3:41] into the Glorious time of Pentecost the
[3:43] following of the holy spirit in the
[3:44] early Church of the in the Jewish
[3:47] dispensation then going through another
[3:49] period of the Gentile Church through a
[3:50] Dark Age and then coming out again into
[3:52] the Millennium at the end and in
[3:54] separation from unbelief he said if you
[3:56] notice King Solomon in the day of
[3:58] Solomon Israel was at its bright briest
[4:00] turning then the king of Ahab time of
[4:02] King Ahab it was at its darkest just at
[4:05] the dark time of Israel where Ahab
[4:06] married a little old Idol worshipper and
[4:10] brought idolatry into Jewish religion so
[4:12] did the Holy Ghost Church marrying into
[4:14] the world and bringing idolatry in the
[4:17] Dark Ages very beautiful type on both
[4:21] churches and God keeps his word he said
[4:24] there was King Ahab of the Old Testament
[4:25] which king Ahab in his time is a
[4:27] beautiful type of the New Testament and
[4:30] notice just as Ahab married Jezebel and
[4:32] idolatry and brought idolatry into Egypt
[4:34] was a TI and the seven dispensations of
[4:36] the Old Testament as the seven
[4:37] candlesticks of the New Testament and
[4:39] the Dark Ages the 1500 years of Dark
[4:42] Ages protestantism married romanism and
[4:44] brought idolatry into the church just
[4:46] the same way watch the Bible and see if
[4:49] it doesn't say that that's right through
[4:51] that 1500 years of Dark Ages you come
[4:53] out with a false baptism sprinkling the
[4:56] false name false everything else and God
[4:58] said you have a little light and you
[5:00] have a name but you denied
[5:02] mine and I I read somewhere that the
[5:04] reason the the seven candlesticks type
[5:08] the the middle types the Dark Ages
[5:10] because in that Temple that when you
[5:12] went to light the middle ones they were
[5:13] further up it was still the same Holy
[5:15] Ghost it's still the same God in his
[5:18] church but the light was further up so
[5:20] down on the ground it was it was a
[5:22] little bit dark so that just a a type of
[5:24] God is still in his church but um the
[5:28] word had been eaten away we'll look at
[5:30] that in a
[5:33] second and in the darkest AG Elijah
[5:37] thought that there were no other
[5:38] believers and now at First Kings 19 he
[5:40] said I I have been very jealous for the
[5:43] Lord God of hosts because the children
[5:44] of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant
[5:46] throwing down thine altars and slain thy
[5:48] prophets with the sword and I even I
[5:52] only am left and they seek my life take
[5:55] it away when all hope looked gone looked
[5:58] like it was no hope at at all and we
[6:00] we'll see in Ezekiel 37 all Ezekiel saws
[6:04] Dry Bones it look like there's how how
[6:06] is anything good going to come out of
[6:09] what looks like
[6:10] death and but God Made A
[6:15] Way and then at the
[6:17] end of both Church ages he Elijah came
[6:21] Elijah John the Baptist to restore the
[6:24] Israelite fathers to the to turn the
[6:26] heart of the Israelite fathers to the
[6:27] children and at the end to turn the the
[6:30] children back to the faith of the
[6:31] original Pentecostal
[6:38] fathers see so now let's look
[6:44] at kind of kind of run through um I'm
[6:48] just do a quick overview of Joel's um
[6:52] and Joel one and we're all familiar with
[6:55] this scripture that which the Palmer
[6:56] worm has left at the Locust eaten and
[6:58] that which the Locust at left left ha
[7:00] the cankerworm eaten and that which the
[7:01] can worm ha left ha the caterpillar
[7:03] eaten and brother venam in Palmer Locus
[7:06] cat cankerworm caterpillar in 1953 he
[7:09] said during this time of Joel's prophecy
[7:12] here the church was in a terrible
[7:13] condition backslid just prior the coming
[7:15] of the Lord the first time and how did
[7:17] the Spirit come upon this prophet and he
[7:19] foresaw things and he saw the condition
[7:21] of the Jews and he saw the condition of
[7:24] the church in this
[7:26] day so it's the condition of the Jews
[7:29] and the condition of the
[7:36] church in the second seal 1963 he said
[7:40] that that wasn't
[7:41] done that wasn't what done it the first
[7:44] thing that's done the whole thing was
[7:45] that she turned from the word she turned
[7:47] from the word and the first thing
[7:48] started the prostitution in the Church
[7:49] of the Living God Christ bride she
[7:51] turned from the word and accepted Roman
[7:53] Dogma instead of God's word what's
[7:56] happened to every organization that's
[7:57] did the very same thing
[8:00] and then it started growing again
[8:02] through Luther Wesley Pentecost the word
[8:04] and these were all works of the spirit
[8:05] just like Ezekiel um the the Holy Spirit
[8:10] uh performing the four step the four
[8:13] stages you can't say that Luther wasn't
[8:16] uh wasn't a work of the Holy Spirit or
[8:17] Wesley it was all a work of the Holy
[8:20] Spirit the resume of the
[8:23] ages he said be uh he was reading Joel
[8:27] chapter 2 be in you children of Zion and
[8:30] rejoice in the Lord your God for he has
[8:32] given you the former rain moderately and
[8:33] he caus you to come down for you the
[8:35] rain the former rain the latter rain and
[8:38] then he continues on he says now it says
[8:40] God is going to restore the Lutheran age
[8:42] did not restore the church it started a
[8:43] Reformation the wesling age did not
[8:45] restore the Pentecostal W did not
[8:47] restore but God has to restore for he
[8:49] cannot deny his word this is not the
[8:51] resurrection of the church it is the
[8:53] restoration God will take the church
[8:55] right back to Pentecost till the
[8:57] beginning now notice in verse 2 it tells
[9:00] why we need restoration the Locust
[9:02] cankerworm caterpillar and palm worm
[9:04] have eaten all but the root and a small
[9:06] bit of the stem now we are told that all
[9:09] these insects are all one and the same
[9:11] in different stages that is right they
[9:12] are the Antichrist spirit manifested in
[9:15] organization denomination and false
[9:18] Doctrine Through the Ages and that poor
[9:20] little root and stalk is going to be
[9:22] restored God isn't going to plant a new
[9:24] church but is going to bring his
[9:26] original planting back to Original Seed
[9:28] he's doing it as state in verse 23 by
[9:30] the teaching of former rain next will
[9:32] come the Harvest rain or Rapture in
[9:35] faith so I have just a little summary of
[9:38] of the all all the different sermons
[9:40] that brother man preached from 1953 on
[9:43] about the the four stages palom the
[9:47] palor he said what did that eat away it
[9:49] ate away the um the nine spiritual gifts
[9:52] and he went through it in his sermon he
[9:54] said I got a whole page of what the um
[9:57] the palore made but it start the the the
[10:00] one thing that he always Associates with
[10:02] the Palmer worm was brotherly
[10:05] love and then it also ate faith in God's
[10:08] word CU if you the pomor meats away you
[10:12] don't know what's what um he ate he eat
[10:15] away he ate away the fruit of
[10:18] joy and your peace of mind knowing that
[10:21] you're
[10:24] saved and the restoration of the Bride
[10:26] free 1962 they said now let's picture a
[10:29] big tree of God's tree is bearing nine
[10:31] spiritual gifts they're Healing The Sick
[10:33] they're speaking in tongues they're
[10:34] casting out Devils they're doing great
[10:36] works and preaching the unadulterated
[10:38] word of God no denomination to tie them
[10:40] down they're free doing a great work so
[10:42] I think about this right here and right
[10:44] here the starting point everything's
[10:48] wonderful right here in Acts the spirit
[10:52] is completely being manifested the signs
[10:54] and wonders among the people so in come
[10:57] this little old devil setting up with
[11:00] his his two horns sitting out in front
[11:01] like a grasshopper you know and his
[11:03] little old greedy teeth that's his first
[11:04] the Palmer worm he come in to eat off
[11:06] brotherly love he said you know so and
[11:09] so did so and so over so and so's
[11:14] church I wouldn't believe that bunch of
[11:18] people see there he is first thing and
[11:22] we're all I I think the lack of
[11:25] Brotherly Love is what gives us all
[11:26] scars we've heard you know people along
[11:29] l Road people say hurtful things and um
[11:34] you know you say well so and so
[11:36] shouldn't be offended if I don't shake
[11:37] their hand but it's not their fault if
[11:39] they're offended you go ahead and Shake
[11:41] everybody's hand and make everybody feel
[11:43] really welcome because the sign in
[11:49] the you like that the sign in the early
[11:53] church was that Believers loved one
[11:56] another that was the evidence of what
[11:59] what a Christian
[12:00] was was love among the people in
[12:09] our excuse me all
[12:13] right our store
[12:16] 1957 he said if we need fences to build
[12:20] it ought to be denominational
[12:22] fences it ought to be love fences to
[12:25] keep the insect out to keep the pal worm
[12:27] out for he is the devil's number one
[12:30] Destroyer yeah
[12:34] yep and you know um we like we like to
[12:38] make fences I was thinking about all the
[12:39] the time somebody will uh associate uh
[12:43] just different things about what church
[12:45] you go to and uh different things about
[12:48] your character or whatever and they draw
[12:49] a little fence around you and put you in
[12:51] a category but he said don't don't do
[12:54] that draw your make your fence bigger
[12:57] and because that's the sign kind of a a
[12:59] real believing
[13:03] church he said this Jesus said this will
[13:06] all men
[13:07] know that you're my disciples when you
[13:10] have love one for the other that's right
[13:13] Pentecost had that I speaking Pentecost
[13:15] meaning the first group of the Apostles
[13:16] and the disciples they had that
[13:18] Brotherly Love they wasn't griev they
[13:20] sold everything they had for the
[13:22] furthering of the church they were so
[13:25] together till even one word the other
[13:27] one till one when till even when one
[13:30] heard the other one died they said let
[13:32] us go and die with you such a feeling
[13:35] now Jesus spoke of this and said that
[13:37] Paul did rather and said let Brotherly
[13:39] Love continue that was in the first
[13:41] church was something taking
[13:44] place and there was a fell come in the
[13:46] name of a pmer worm and when he began to
[13:48] eat on that vine of Brotherly Love he
[13:50] cut the very sapl line of it because it
[13:53] don't make any difference how smart we
[13:55] are how much we think we know or how
[13:58] much we want want to be different from
[13:59] somebody else as long as that brotherly
[14:02] feeling isn't among us we are fighting a
[14:04] losing battle that's right we can't win
[14:07] there's no way for us to win and the
[14:10] next one so the Palm worm took away
[14:12] brotherly
[14:13] love and the ne the Locust took
[14:17] away I kind of think of these two as um
[14:21] brother Way's going to start going
[14:22] through the seals the the Antichrist
[14:24] Peri this saing one out the doctrine and
[14:27] the and the and then Crown the
[14:32] Locust took away the leaves palor took
[14:36] away the fruit which is brotherly love
[14:39] the fruits of the spirit the Locust took
[14:42] away leaves Divine
[14:45] Fellowship which is knowing having a
[14:48] relationship with God you remember the
[14:49] story we all know the story of Billy
[14:51] Paul went out heard his his dad praying
[14:53] in that room and calling out Papa God we
[14:56] think well wow brother BR had such a
[14:58] relationship but what about me what
[15:01] about my relationship with God I'm
[15:03] supposed to know that I know that I'm
[15:07] saved and the restoration of the brid
[15:09] tree
[15:10] 1962 he said what is fellowship what
[15:13] does the leaves do makes it cool where
[15:15] the birds fly and under the leaves cool
[15:18] off there's your tree again and he shall
[15:19] be like a tree that's planted seed all
[15:21] right where people can come and sit down
[15:24] under the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[15:26] cool off a little bit you're all
[15:28] flustrated
[15:29] and don't know what's happening and
[15:30] whether you die whether you're shaved or
[15:32] not you don't know whether this church
[15:35] is right or that's right just come down
[15:38] under the tree that's got some leaves on
[15:40] it sit down there let the winds from
[15:42] Heaven go to blow like a Russian Mighty
[15:45] Man through the leaves you know begins
[15:47] and he begin to cool off a little bit so
[15:50] this is General down through the church
[15:53] he's eating away but it's also in each
[15:56] individual's life got to make make sure
[15:58] that the devil doesn't need a way it's
[16:01] your fellowship with God to know that
[16:03] you
[16:04] know and the canker worm ate away at the
[16:08] bark which is you covering your religion
[16:12] your Doctrine and our religion is the
[16:15] blood the life in the blood that covers
[16:19] the
[16:20] word the Kangle worm took away the
[16:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost because if you
[16:25] don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[16:26] you don't know where you are you can't
[16:29] understand the
[16:31] word and the restoration of the brid
[16:34] tree so then that same group of men sent
[16:37] a lady down said brother renom if the
[16:39] angel of the Lord told you the angel of
[16:41] the Lord you know his picture is there
[16:42] you see if the angel of the Lord told
[16:44] you that well will believe it I said
[16:46] anybody that a ministerial group that
[16:48] would be that weak if the angel of the
[16:50] Lord said if that angel said something
[16:51] contrary to this word it wouldn't be the
[16:53] angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord
[16:55] will vindicate the word that's exactly
[16:58] what what he's always done through every
[16:59] age he still does the same thing he
[17:01] stays with the word and any Minister
[17:04] Anointed with the Holy Ghost will stay
[17:06] by the same word because the Bible said
[17:07] that the entire Bible was wrote by the
[17:09] Holy Ghost and how can you have the Holy
[17:12] Ghost and deny what the Bible says the
[17:15] very spirit in you it Bears record that
[17:17] is not from God see the korm has been
[17:19] eaten that's all eating away the true
[17:22] things of God yes sir unauthoritative
[17:24] word is contrary to the doctrine of the
[17:27] Apostles oh my what's unauthoritative
[17:29] word everything the Bible says is true
[17:32] you can rest on that you can rest on on
[17:35] what brother Bram taught because he
[17:37] taught what Paul taught and when he went
[17:39] be the curtain of time they said we're
[17:41] resting on what that you preached
[17:44] nothing but what Paul preached the same
[17:52] thing and then the
[17:54] caterpillar sucks out the
[17:57] life
[17:59] and he said who do we call who we going
[18:01] to call him
[18:02] denomination that's that guy's right
[18:04] name why he's a destroyer sucks to life
[18:07] the restoration of the brid tree 1962
[18:09] he's already got the bark eat off and
[18:11] the fruits eat off of it and oh brother
[18:12] it's all gone all the gifts of the
[18:15] Spirit is gone no Divine Healing no
[18:17] speaking in tongues no prophecy no
[18:20] nothing don't believe in being prophets
[18:22] they don't believe in these things they
[18:24] don't know all manmade everything they
[18:27] got is man-made
[18:30] artificial the church natural there is a
[18:32] church natural that's the one is made up
[18:34] by
[18:37] man and then I will restore 1957 he said
[18:40] then the gifts will come and they say oh
[18:42] John said this was this and this was
[18:45] that it's the Holy Spirit truly but it
[18:47] can't get through to produce itself
[18:49] these little insects are keeping it down
[18:51] that's the reason we can't have real why
[18:52] this great power that's in the church
[18:54] should have swept her from the sea to
[18:56] shining sea the great church of the
[18:58] Living God should be every Power what
[19:00] does it just as soon as one raises up
[19:01] here comes the caterpillar and starts
[19:03] boring on but one great thing God said
[19:06] it will be that way we see it and God
[19:07] said I will restore I'm looking for it
[19:10] God bless you and um and in the
[19:12] restoration of the brid tree 1962 he
[19:15] said I know we got some late spring late
[19:17] season of Easter coming the Lord is
[19:19] tearing his coming they say everything
[19:21] like that and the cold winds killed a
[19:24] lot of them denominational branches but
[19:26] it can't kill that life that's
[19:27] predestinated because it might look
[19:31] like it's not being restored just like
[19:35] when Ezekiel looks at those Dry Bones he
[19:36] said that I Lord if thou
[19:39] sayest um and Elijah says where this is
[19:44] this is a difficult thing but the
[19:47] Lord the Lord promised it he said
[19:50] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[19:51] word shall not all that he fornew he
[19:54] called those who he called he is
[19:55] Justified those he had Justified he has
[19:57] already glorified hallelujah it's
[19:59] written in the book the Lamb's Book of
[20:00] Life and cannot die and Ezekiel 37 is
[20:05] associated with Hosea 61 through3 which
[20:07] says come and let us return unto the
[20:09] Lord for he hath torn and he will heal
[20:11] us he ha smitten he will bind us up
[20:13] after two days will he revive us two
[20:16] days in the third day he will raise us
[20:19] up and we shall live in his sight then
[20:21] shall we know if we follow on to know
[20:23] the Lord is going forth is prepared as
[20:24] the morning and he shall come unto us as
[20:26] the rain as the light L and former rain
[20:29] un the Earth so now let's go to Ezekiel
[20:32] 37 and start going through the four
[20:44] stages verse one the hand of the Lord
[20:47] was upon me and carried me out of the
[20:48] spirit of the Lord and set me down in
[20:50] the midst of the valley which was full
[20:52] of
[20:54] Bones so the nation of Israel is in a
[20:57] condition where it looks
[20:59] like they uh this the spir spiritual
[21:02] condition of the church the spiritual
[21:04] condition of Israel they've gone after
[21:07] idolatry this uh this this spirit is in
[21:10] four different forms is Whitted away
[21:12] down until they're in the Dark Ages look
[21:14] like looks like nobody has serving yet
[21:17] and and God's going to start restoring
[21:19] and calls me verse two and calls me to
[21:21] pass by them round about and behold
[21:23] there were very many in the open Valley
[21:26] and lo they were very dry dry because
[21:28] the flesh was completely consumed off of
[21:30] there was nothing left the marrow was
[21:32] all dried up there's no hope in the
[21:35] knle in Ephesians 2:1 it says and you
[21:38] hath he quickened who were dead in
[21:40] trespasses and sins in Colossians 2:13
[21:43] and you being dead in your sins and the
[21:45] uncircumcision of your flesh have he
[21:46] quickened together with him having
[21:48] forgiven you all
[21:50] trespasses and then verse three and he
[21:52] said unto me son of man can these bones
[21:54] live and I answered oh Lord God God thou
[21:59] knowest and he said thou knowest because
[22:03] if God has anything to do with it
[22:05] nothing is impossible nothing is
[22:07] impossible of them that
[22:09] believe and verse four guine he said
[22:11] unto me prophesy upon these bones and
[22:13] say unto them oh you bones oh you dry
[22:16] bones hear the word of the
[22:19] Lord the prophecy is not just somebody
[22:23] saying something halfhazard but this is
[22:25] going to happen remember when brother BR
[22:27] was preaching on the WRA he said now
[22:28] it's been spoken let it come to pass and
[22:31] there's nothing nothing in the natural
[22:33] no way anything can keep it from coming
[22:34] to pass it's going to come to
[22:36] pass and the prophecy was to the
[22:40] bones spoken to the bones as though they
[22:42] could hear he says speak to the bones
[22:46] and the bones obey the
[22:48] prophecy in verse 5 thus saith the Lord
[22:50] God unto these
[22:52] bones behold I will cause breath to
[22:54] enter into you and you shall live and I
[22:57] looked strongest Concord at what breath
[22:59] is the is the Hebrew word is haruach
[23:03] which means the spirit of God and
[23:05] inspiring ecstatic state of Prophecy as
[23:08] impelling Prophet to utter instruction
[23:10] or warning imparting warlike energy and
[23:13] executive and administrative power and
[23:15] if you look if you read ahead think
[23:17] about a warlike energy they became they
[23:19] stood up and they became an army is
[23:23] endowing men with various gifts as
[23:25] energy of life ain't ancient Angel and
[23:28] later
[23:29] Shaka in verse six and I will lay sinu
[23:32] upon you and will bring up flesh upon
[23:36] you and cover you with skin and put
[23:38] breath in you and you shall live and you
[23:41] shall know that I am the Lord so the
[23:43] four stages MH sinu flesh skin and
[23:47] breath breath is the last
[23:50] one the Living Word made manifest I
[23:53] think about that in in
[23:55] uh in uh the unpardonable s 1954 brother
[23:59] R said what does the flesh do the flesh
[24:02] only veils the blood the blood is the
[24:04] life that's the only way that keeps life
[24:05] in my body is for the skin and flesh and
[24:08] tissues and sign and so forth to hold
[24:10] the blood in their places so they can
[24:12] give life to this Tabernacle so that I'm
[24:14] dwelling in is that right that's what
[24:16] veiled God for mankind was the blood and
[24:19] sign you and skins of Jesus Christ the
[24:21] son of God the unadulterated birth of
[24:23] his who God the Father overshadowed the
[24:26] Virgin Mary and created in her the blood
[24:27] of his own being the creation and in
[24:30] there his skin kept it from man but one
[24:33] day the sin of man opened up his heart
[24:35] with a spear and his blood ran out on
[24:37] the ground it was give freely for the
[24:39] sins of the world and it's revealed
[24:42] today that's what Ezekiel was talking
[24:44] about the word being revealed
[24:47] today as that blood came forth also came
[24:50] spirit and through the washing of the
[24:52] Water by the blood through the spirit we
[24:54] are born into the kingdom of God new
[24:56] creatures in Christ Jesus
[24:59] in verse 7 so I prophesied as I was
[25:02] commanded and as I prophesied there was
[25:04] a noise and behold was shaking and the
[25:08] bones came together bone to his bone
[25:11] every bone had a match and they all came
[25:14] together in Perfect
[25:16] Harmony I think this is speaking of the
[25:19] Resurrection too if you were all the
[25:21] people that were buried at seed uh
[25:24] destroyed in a bomb or whatever at the
[25:26] resurrection the resurrection uh comes
[25:30] every atom every molecule is going to
[25:32] come back right into its place just like
[25:34] these bones return to their
[25:37] place and it was something done that
[25:40] naturally there's no way but God
[25:43] orchestrated everything just like he
[25:45] orchestrates a child being uh born
[25:48] formed in its mother's
[25:51] womb God keeps his word 1957 he said
[25:55] I've been down to the Pentecostals let
[25:57] me read this whole story and after we
[25:59] had our dinner he said I want to ask you
[26:01] a question Mr brand I said yes sir and I
[26:03] thought oh my here it comes now Lu and
[26:06] Dean and he said I've been down to the
[26:08] Pentecostals and see them kick the
[26:10] furniture around and everything like
[26:11] that but I want to ask you is anything
[26:13] to it I said yes sir there is I said
[26:16] it's like a little kid when he gets a
[26:17] toy he just Falls and I said like
[26:19] Ezekiel said there's a valley full of
[26:21] dry bones he said Can these live he said
[26:24] th know us so he said prophesy to dry
[26:26] bones and when the bones come together
[26:29] there was a rattling and a shaking a lot
[26:31] of noise but then when the skin come on
[26:32] or the meat come on them there wasn't
[26:34] much noise he said prophesy to the
[26:36] spirit now see I think that's what's
[26:39] going on see so I said they I see them
[26:41] make a lot of noise I said I think the
[26:43] bones are coming
[26:46] together and as these bones started
[26:48] coming together and Ezekiel Saw the
[26:50] prophecy coming to path coming to pass
[26:53] I'm sure that his faith increased and we
[26:56] can look around and see the signs of of
[26:57] the time how Israel coming together
[27:01] being joined we'll read further on the
[27:02] two sticks coming together should
[27:04] increase our faith because Israel is the
[27:06] timeline that we watch in verse eight
[27:09] and when I beh beheld L the S and the
[27:12] flesh Came Upon them and the skin
[27:14] covered them above it but there was no
[27:16] breath in it so the s in the flesh came
[27:19] up it gradually
[27:23] spread and started to look like men m in
[27:27] the shape of
[27:30] men but there's still no breath the sin
[27:33] are holding everything
[27:37] together into one cohesive hole and in
[27:39] verse n he said then said he unto me
[27:41] prophesy under the wind prophesy son of
[27:44] man and say to the wind thus sayith the
[27:46] Lord God come from the Four Winds oh
[27:48] breath and breathe upon these slangs
[27:50] that they may live now Israel was
[27:53] scattered to the Four Winds and the
[27:55] bride will be gathered from the Four
[27:56] Winds and in Matthew 2431 he said he
[27:59] shall send his angels with a great sound
[28:01] of a trumpet and they shall gather
[28:03] together his elect from the Four Winds
[28:04] from one end of the heaven to the
[28:07] other and a greater than Solomon is here
[28:09] 1963 brother say we try to bring it over
[28:12] in one of a bunch and say we got it and
[28:14] you ain't got nothing else to do with it
[28:16] because you don't see through my glasses
[28:18] we mustn't do that it's not right as
[28:20] long as the devil can make you fight one
[28:22] another he don't have to fight so when
[28:24] you see that uniting of the powers of
[28:26] God Gathering his church together from
[28:28] the Four Winds of the earth then you're
[28:30] going to see something take place the
[28:32] questions and answers 1964 and then he
[28:35] said and then shall he send his angels
[28:36] and gather together his elect from the
[28:38] Four Winds and shall it in the up utmost
[28:41] parts of the
[28:42] earth that's talking of the Resurrection
[28:45] the translation going up he'll send
[28:46] forth his angels together did you ever
[28:49] think what the angels are or Messengers
[28:50] he gather them together congregate them
[28:52] together bring them together bind them
[28:54] together from the utmost parts of the
[28:56] Earth to the utmost parts of Heaven the
[28:57] word that was been made manifest on
[28:59] Earth see get it the word has been
[29:01] spoken here it's
[29:03] manifested and then verse 10 so I
[29:06] prophesied as he commanded me and the
[29:09] breath came into them and they lived and
[29:12] stood up upon their feet an exceeding
[29:14] great
[29:15] Army brother randam said in the
[29:17] restoration of the brid
[29:19] Tre he's talking about the four stages I
[29:22] will restore sayith the Lord the fourth
[29:25] light is to come that will bring forth
[29:26] the same signs watch justification
[29:29] brought back the pul
[29:31] sanctification brought back the
[29:33] bar what brought back the leaf
[29:35] Pentecostals what is it Pentecostals
[29:38] leaves clap their hand re Joy rejoicing
[29:41] Pentecostal what the fourth was the word
[29:43] itself the word made flesh fruits of the
[29:45] proof of the Resurrection sign that
[29:47] Christ has finally after justification
[29:50] been planted sanctification been planted
[29:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations
[29:55] died out and Christ has again centered
[29:57] himself stuff like that cap of the
[29:58] pyramid first line justification
[30:00] sanctification bapt baptism of the Holy
[30:02] Ghost then coming of the
[30:04] cap and the restoration of the Bride
[30:06] tree he said prophesy so man can these
[30:08] bones live wish we had time I got it
[30:10] wrote down here but I have to miss that
[30:12] prophesy can these bones live what's the
[30:13] four stages of that coming forth of that
[30:15] church what's the four stages of
[30:17] ezekiel's dry bones coming forth but the
[30:19] life only come not when the sign new
[30:21] skin was on them but the when the wind
[30:23] blowed upon them that's when come back
[30:25] that fourth message of life let's skip
[30:28] down the fourth was the word itself the
[30:30] word made flesh fruits of the proof of
[30:32] the Resurrection sign that Christ has
[30:35] finally been
[30:37] planted and then paragraph
[30:40] 5:14 what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch
[30:43] being honed out so that it can fit with
[30:45] the same kind of ministry he had when he
[30:47] went away that when he come back he'll
[30:49] catch the whole thing in the Rapture
[30:51] with Justified Sanctified in the baptism
[30:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid
[30:56] will stand again the house of of God
[30:57] will live again the tree of life is
[30:59] growing again and I'm running out of
[31:01] time so I'm going to skip ahead down to
[31:04] the two
[31:06] sticks verse
[31:09] 15 so God's calling his bride from the
[31:12] Four Winds come come together to
[31:14] manifest his
[31:16] word and we got two sticks one
[31:18] represents Judah and one represents
[31:20] Ephraim remember here Israel turn down
[31:24] the word that were blinded and allow us
[31:27] to be the the wild tree to be grafted in
[31:31] to the tame
[31:32] tree and
[31:34] Israel's being joined together the two
[31:37] sticks were prophesy to be come together
[31:40] and and uh because at the end time
[31:42] brother R preach the sermon the uniting
[31:44] time we are coming together remember the
[31:47] birthright was a a natural many nations
[31:49] and a spiritual many nations uh the
[31:52] natural was uh we have Abraham to our
[31:56] father but Isaac was the seed of the
[31:58] promise and um so we're being united
[32:02] it's part of that the birthright many
[32:04] nations with Christ let me just read
[32:06] real quick Romans
[32:08] 4 um talks about what the birthright is
[32:11] at Romans 4:1 he he receive the sign of
[32:13] circumcision and seal the righteousness
[32:15] of the faith which he had yet being un
[32:17] uncircumcised that he might be the
[32:19] father of all that that believe that
[32:20] they be not circumcised that
[32:22] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[32:23] also therefore it is a faith that it
[32:25] might be by grace to the end the promise
[32:28] might be sure to all the seed not to
[32:30] that only which is of the law but to
[32:32] that also which is of the faith of
[32:33] Abraham who is the father of us off as
[32:35] it is written I made thee a father of
[32:37] many nations skip down to verse 18 who
[32:39] against hope believed in hope that he
[32:41] might become the father of many nations
[32:42] according to that which was spoken so
[32:44] shall
[32:45] ICB and in 1963 the uniting time and
[32:48] sign brother R preach there is a uniting
[32:50] time and that's on right now what is she
[32:52] uniting for the Rapture God's getting
[32:54] her ready yes her uniting what is she
[32:56] uniting in with the word for all heavens
[32:59] and earth will pass away my word shall
[33:01] never pass away she she's uniting
[33:04] herself with thus sayith the Lord
[33:05] regardless of what any denomination or
[33:07] anybody else says she's uniting herself
[33:10] she's getting ready why she is the bride
[33:12] that's right and she's uniting herself
[33:14] with her
[33:15] bridegroom I skip down to trying to do
[33:18] God is her without being the will of God
[33:19] in act 65 and today he's standing Among
[33:22] Us in the person of the Holy Ghost
[33:24] manifesting himself more and more coming
[33:26] into his church making himself known
[33:28] because him and the bride and the groom
[33:30] will be the same making himself known

[34:00] the bonds of the spirit
[34:03] um it it was the one that was with Moses
