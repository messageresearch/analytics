that know me were were pulling pulling on the lord you know that god would speak to us this morning and and any minister really wants that right to be an oracle of god to get out of the way and let the lord speak to his people through him so it's wonderful to be back and since i last met you uh we did go over to italian last year hope to go back to india this year uh looking forward to a great time god willing uh this is this november and india again and certainly and the dream brother brought him give me that god would bless my minister in india that's kim to pass folks the minute i touch down there i know god's going to bless everything everything you know it's wonderful and he's always done it you know and so we had a wonderful time last year and bob cased a few people over there but i forget how many it was five or six people there but led a good few souls to the lord and you know it's wonderful praise the lord over the years uh at the time i was in africa uh the brothers over there brother some of you wouldn't have me count up people you know i said how many people want to be baptized would you tell me tonight so i can go home and tell the people say oh brother don't you worry about that you know all right don't you worry about that you've seen the hands that's all right they'll be taken care of so so but uh amen it's not like that over in india and uh you know uh god is still moving he's still bringing on his bride and uh we had a wonderful few wonderful times i don't want to take up too much time i want to go to the word this morning really but uh some fun phenomenal things that that i can brother something about the little woman that that was uh was unconscious lying unconscious at death's door i i stand here behind this holy pulpit and i'll never get closer to someone actually being dead i'm coming back to life amen and it was just the grace and mercy of god uh that we prayed for her she was ice cold lying there on the little uh pallet and uh and the lord just touched her raised her up she asked for food later on about an hour and a half or so later on and she got on the side of bed and then the next day shots for more so still living today there's healing and the atonement amen and some things stick out in your mind really ah you know i see a lot of young people here and it's wonderful to see you amen and we know there's nothing in the world there's nothing in the world will take the place of god's love and i'll tell you what there was a young girl she was an indian girl she came up almost 70 miles almost 70 miles and a regularly old bus down from the mountains and when we got there was the evening service and when we were all finishing the bank eye i looked up at the clock was about 10 10 minutes to 10 o'clock and the brothers were talking to her and she'd come all that way to be baptized all that way to be baptized i tell you what i just admire so much and she was a real mccoy she was a real gem and uh when we were standing there uh i said that's wonderful i said well now i'm not able to do that because we're leaving in the morning and we we did we left at 10 o'clock in the morning on the train but she she wanted to be baptized and i said well the pastor will baptize and he said no she said you she just kept pointing at me i don't know where she got that from but but but so we had to say well what are we going to do and we ended up baptizing her just at between half seven and quarter late the next morning we went down to the the pool uh are down to the it's not a pool it's actually a canal and uh and we baptized her there and may i say this please because when i go away again and i'll be notifying brother samuel that i'll be going just to ask for your prayers you know when you step into these canals and things like that i mean it ain't going to some lovely uh perfumed thing or no i mean i felt someone something swimming by me and touching my leg i don't know what it was you know and and you know when you're in the clay and the muck down there and you know just pray about this because skin i feel in my skin at times and you know you can pick up things and i appreciate that just don't forget things like that you know and god would keep us that we wouldn't be food poisoned or anything like that so i appreciate that and um and we bob taster the next morning and of course the the daughter-in-law of the woman who had been raised up the day before was she cut you know something that i found brother samuel i find when god when people see god moving they move they start to move takes a lot to move them but boy when he starts to move they move sharp and the day before that woman was prayed for she was to be baptized the next morning she was at the pool or at the canal ready to be baptized so we got case that indian girl are they the ethnic girl we've updated her and then there's another brother from wherever he came from i don't know he was there as well so it was wonderful like that and we also and the day before had baptized that pastor and i just would show this for you because i think it's lovely that this pastor uh he he has a television think i don't know if he still hasn't got it i don't know but um he had heard from another pastor that i was coming to that area and so he'd come up to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ i had nothing to do with it i was just going to do it do the job and when we got into the pool uh he could speak english and he said to me brother gary he said brother he said i was raised in the hindu he said i did not know anything about this he said but when i became a christian he said i didn't know nothing about it he said i just was baptized in the trinitarian time and he said but you know when the other pastor told told him about it the truth he said i have not had one day's peace imagine that imagine people today you know hearing it oh yeah yeah yeah yeah but you know and they'll still go on that way well he didn't get a day's piece right and i said to him you know it's wonderful when you can raise up and speak in the name of the lord and i said to your brother today hallelujah you get your peace right right there in the water today brother i tell you what he almost killed him under the water like that i was so wonderful and if you think let me just give you honest testimony because i watched him for the rest of the day and he was just like a young he'd been about 50 i think or maybe 45 in that direction but i watched him for the rest of the day and he was serving everybody and smiling and going on and halloween and all the rest today and i stopped him at one one stage and i said tell me i said how's your peace all wonderful i could tell you so many kids for an hour folks tell me about them trips i could really you know just leave them so you don't have to pull you don't have to nothing like that you just leave it to god you may be walking walking out of the church that night and somebody will pull you over and say this this young man wants to become a christian yeah you know he's been in the meeting you lead them to the lord amen and you just go on your way it's just so wonderful so wonderful praise the lord and this year we also went over that was november and this year we went over to uh to thailand and vietnam and there's a couple of people that really come to hear me in thailand and then they go off again and wander off but this year when they came amen i don't think they maybe really expected to but the holy spirit got a real hold of them and so we ended up baptizing eight people in thailand this year here people thai souls hit people amen i can't some of them can speak my language and some of them can and it was it was wonderful praise the lord i just told my soul it amen a new beginning amen and so that was wonderful and also we used the money that with the moneys that we've got amen uh so to buy the food everywhere we go in india everywhere we go when we go up into the hills or something like that not to a rich church now some churches can take care of themselves um but you know when you go into the poor places we always buy them rice and good rice hey man i believe god does things good and those things and uh not just old scrappy stuff just good the best you can get and uh we leave it with the purse amen and to help them and so we did that in thailand as well and it was i just rejoice in it you know and sometimes you know you'd be watching a whole church like if we were all fed later on and you were all sitting around and a big again and all the rest is getting served out to you and you're eating it all the way in the end you know and they're happy so if you're happy they're happy and i'm happy and the lord's helping sure wonderful and we went on down to vietnam and we had another wonderful time all there was about 25 pastors there and i love it because when they go back even they're going to tell what they've heard they're going to tell what they've heard amen and i'm marvelous i'm getting to know some of them well and so we had three days of good teaching with them pastors amen and all the funds fed them i paid for their petrols and whatnot and their bus first some of them and someone won their motorcycles uh so it was wonderful that's where it all goes you know and then we went off to see one of the young pastors that was there and we went off to his little church he started six months prior and it was wonderful that day it was two hours on a motorbike now i have hit my 64th year two hours on the motorbike behind you know and i've had but the lord gave us the strength and we stopped off this lovely sunny day and the lord gave us a strength and we stopped off uh uh you know and so to have some refreshments and then we got to the police and they had to when we got to this place the pastor was there but when i got out of the bus the first thing they did was they gave me or sorry not the bus um uh we had to go by bus to this place and uh when we got off we had to get all the motorbike stuff on with a mask and and radar like that there and they gave me one of their jackets these vietnamese jackets so that would be disguised now i'm this morning i forgot to put my wife because of what's happened you know forgot to fill my wife forgot to bring the photographs i'm so sorry but about that i would love you to see them but i want to show them to your pastor and the stem few and uh anyway you wouldn't recognize it's me and somebody said what did you do with your hands i said i made sure my hands was like that so so nobody they could they really didn't want they didn't want any of the authorities of the place there's a big army camp and plenty of activity and they didn't want they didn't want them to know that i was there as a white man so that was fine and then we got into a little village away off the main road so nobody cared very much then and i could take it off and preach and that there's about 15 16 people there but about seven of them came to the lord amen accepted the lord so obviously we just weren't going to baptize them right away but that young man will do it and god love him he had a corrugated iron house maybe from that wall to where i am about that that long that's that's what he's got him in his wagon his little child and the little fella was out there with his uh little uh tricycle good running around there was all these trees with that oh uh what is it the rubber rubber trees that's the break in the middle and that little place and uh they don't have much i laid down on their wooden bed i was tired and i laid down on their wooden bed but what a wonderful time what a wonderful time it was and back back in saigon we had seen the hub last year when uh i was talking to brother joe there at the back and we got talking about that when i went home i thought you know that would be a wonderful thing to do and just coming up to one trip to go to india and spending all this money on a hub machine i thought oh that's going to be tight right but you know god provides he really does provide and so um i knew that the price of it and the taxes and all and to buy it and you know we don't send books over to vietnam we let them print their own books now and so that's a thrill of my heart that's a joy you couldn't imagine how much joy i've got in my heart to see this message that we love printed in vietnamese amen i know they've done it up in vancouver and all that that's fine but these guys have got it now they can print it i've left the money for for more uh paper and an ink and and they're printing it in in vietnamese you wouldn't understand a word of it but it's been all and he said it's good translation so thank god for that and it was wonderful to see that amen and brother david's doing a good job uh there in vietnam so uh we we dedicated his little baby as well uh that was a wonderful thing it was a wonderful thing and then when we come back up again to uh uh i was i was i was leaving i just tell you this i was leaving vietnam and this kind of soldiers you know with all these stars and all that and they're in there doing all the stamping and they don't even talk to you they just lift it look it put it through stomp and hand it back you know and i said man these people are real sad you know and he just here he was because he could understandingly share it to me went back up to thailand and and it was the last service actually took there and uh it was wonderful because two of the sisters that had been baptized had i speak apart more than that had been baptized and this other one whose daughters had been baptized they brought a couple of people in a couple of people and think about it folks invite somebody and amen don't matter if you can say no and fight them right some special meetings coming down and thank you and fight your name around them all right moving you haven't talked to them for years she's going to say lookers i want to go out coming you know amen and i tell you what uh there was two two women got saved i led them to the lord myself two thai people couldn't even speak my language i'll tell you what and that's the last thing that happened before i left thailand i'll lend them souls to the lord so i'm glad praise god i am so glad i've got some little trophies of grace amen but thank you very much for your prayers i appreciate it for your support amen and i tell you what it's just wonderful what the lord has done amen listen we we must go to the word of god and i amen and praise the lord if you you i know you have your bible amen and we want to read two little portions of scripture here amen and i think it's going to be a little bit different for you this morning praise the lord i hope it's not going to be too different but it's a little bit different amen one kings one kings is uh as our first reading seven one king seven i'm in and uh praise the lord we're just going to read two verses here and then we're going to read over in second chronicles but the verses are 49 on 50. and it says on the candlesticks i notice that word candle sticks uh this is this is this is the temple oh pure gold five on the right side and five on the left that is five candlesticks okay so there was ten in the temple before the oracle that's before the holy of holies with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold and the bowls and the snuffers and the basins and the spoons in the centers of pure gold and the hinges of gold both for the doors of the inner house uh the most holy place and for the doors of the house to wet off the temple but just wanted you to notice that there was ten pure golden candle sticks there now if you just follow over a lot of people don't know this but so just you might know it but uh the the kings the book of kings was written before the exile and the book of chronicles was written after they came back from babylon so in in second chronicles amen and we're going to go to uh chapter four i believe it is and we will just read a few scriptures this is just to get a little uh thought to you amen praise the lord amen and we will read it chapter 4 verse 7 here and it says on a midterm candlesticks of gold according to their form and set them in the temple and that would really mean that they were they were taped after moses candlestick and five on the right and five on the left and let me see if we go into verse 19 and 20 and solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of god the golden altar also and the tables were on the show bread was set moreover the candlesticks with their lumps that they should burn after the manor before the oracle of pure gold and the flowers and lamps and tongs made he of pure gold i'm just going down there again and it says uh that everything was a pure goal so that will get us through to what we want there's a slight little difference there in them two scriptures that's why i read them let us just please come this morning grace's heavenly father we thank you lord for gathering us together again lord the prophet told us that as we come to church on sunday morning we honor the resurrection of jesus christ and so father god this morning we just thank you we have done that and lord will do it and lord we just pray now father god lord as we come this day this first day of the week lord that you will just laid our candles lord that you will just touch us and feed us with your head man oh lord and bless us bless the thoughts lord and father god we just pray like as we look at that menorah that we will see no one save jesus only bless us to the same lord we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen praise the lord amen praise the lord well you you were reading the book i don't know if you know this or not i've got it just to remind me that uh we have a society over in britain uh uh and they're called the orange order amen and basically what they stand for is uh they stand for religious and uh civil liberties amen and they died for that and there's a whole history i could go into it on but i'm not but uh at their big parade this year in ross nila and we went down we know some of these people and they had a big banner at the front of the parade saying 400 years of the king james bible this bible is separate and celebrating this year it's 400th year amen thank god they've got their translation in vietnam thank god the message of the hour is in vietnam today hallelujah amen so so wonderful praise the lord um this morning amen and i'll take just 60 minutes for your song from about nine the i want to speak on a subject and i'm just going to tell you how i got to the subject but it's called the lighting of the lamps five and two amen and uh praise the lord there will be more food for thought i just want you to think about it praise the lord and and see what i'm trying to where i'm trying to go but um you know brother branham i remember he was on the trail one time and he walked past a cigarette packet and the holy spirit said pick it up and that's where you got your message amen are thinking man's filter on a holy monster amen praise god it didn't say that and said that said a smoking man's filter had a smoking man's tears but answer but he preached and he used that as an illustration to bring a message and uh last year i i uh brother samuel uh he let me have this here this uh picture of the menorah which i'll use uh briefly today when i'm speaking of this here and i picked up a few uh other uh little edisonites here uh from uh the temple institute amen about these things amen now praise the lord uh and uh when i was a child i learned i learned that sometimes you learn things as a child you'll never forget and at school we learned a little poem and i never forgot it amen and the poem at school was like the lamps upload letter the children are in the street and with their delight they have no sight and where will they plant their feet right some will fall in the gutter some will step in the street so let the lump sup knob later for the children to plant their faith amen well i'm god glad god let alone today for us hallelujah we'll go into it amen praise the lord now i noticed that there was ten lampstands ten light burs and i'm not going to do it in any particular order but just you follow it through it if i can it is awkward i'm going to have to make a few changes here like at intersections but i hope to the holy spirit helps me today i know he will amen and it was part of the furniture of the temple and to write the sanctuary amen that there's no doubt about it that you are and you are a priest amen and uh praise god but if that light had not been lit you would have been in the dark as simple as that amen you could not have got you probably failing over there and said a table or that shoe bread table amen but that was lit that you could have light hallelujah even the high priest that he could see his way into the holy holy spirit amen so uh amen and of course as i said it was based on the fashion of the original and the tabernacle uh in exodus 25 if you want to note it verse 30 uh 39 31 to 39 extremes of all and uh the lovely thing to note about it is this that it was a heavenly origin amen this was not thought of in man's head this came down from from god i'm glory amen and that's a wonderful thing praise the lord and it was pure gold and moses because all the other ones were based on moses one in the tabernacle and you run them and compare them uh and so um like uh if you just look at the tabernacle was a a desert floor they never had any flooring in the tabernacle but the temple did amen and of course it was covered in gold amen and it's symbolic that it's the church you're talking about in the temple and we will walk the streets of gold one day amen but here in the tabernacle on an earthly journey you're you know and that's what the man said some people are so heavenly minded that they're no earthly good all right so so you want to keep your feet on the ground all right nine praise the lord but it was pure gold amen and it was it spoke of christ the deity of christ pure gold absolutely the light of the world hallelujah and we know that i could give you more illustrations and take me to anoint me that i've talked to people muslims and i've talked to hindus and i've talked to all kinds of people showing them uh that they're too lit that we've got the message of the honor vindicated hallelujah feels amen he can't open anybody's eyes but jesus christ time amen hallelujah and that's the kind of thing i can say folks if i met somebody and i do meet people like that and i've seen these uh humans happen brother wait i can say then please you explain to me who did that exactly right who did that hallelujah amen see so amen here he is he's the light of the world the light of god amen and brother brother said life is the revealed word of god amen he said i'd say to that there is no light so he is the light of the revealed word of god that's what he is today amen and it was a pure amen amen a pure white light amen there was no sin or no impurity and him he was incorruptable that flesh amen never corrupted is that right right certain it is hallelujah and the light of the glory the shekinah of god was seen in the face of jesus christ amen so wonderful and it was a beating work amen it had to be molded and beaten and worked out amen and it speaks of the sufferings of christ honest church as you go into these these lamps same analogy i'll just go through it very soon this is just a background actually amen trying to get you up to your crescendo amen and uh praise the lord it was made of one piece of pure gold i remember robbie richie was saying that the one they i think the one they have nine is a gold plated but he said it is their desire that one day they will actually uh have a pure gold menorah okay all right principle we've got a pure gold menorah hallelujah amen uh dr uh zeon and we call it the zion but they call it the jews call it zeon when dr zeon every went back to israel he said i i pray for you at the western wall and he's the apostle of ireland i need to finish this tour and i said that's fine i said thank you very much and i said we'll amen one piece of pure gold speaking of the unity of christ and his church hallelujah that we're part of that amen we're going to show you that right now because you know uh the brother branham always taught us that no scriptures have any private interpretation amen but when it interprets itself god is his own interpreter and the the lovely thing about this is that he interprets it for us doesn't it amen and you just get it have you turned with me here i just in the very book of revelation one praise the lord and there he was in the midst of the seven candlesticks one leg unto the son of man clover the garment see and so write these things in verse 19 chapter one and what i have seen and the things that shall be hereafter and he said the mystery of the seven stars amen and we've got it they're not so little obscure uh things that are right in the right hand of jesus christ hallelujah and they're there and he says which thy source in the right hand that's the power and authority it says are the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels or the messengers of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sourced are the seven churches amen so each each part of that there would speak of each of the seven church teachers amen praise the lord that's wonderful amen and uh praise god a seven branch lamb stand because that's really what it was amen and you know that's what they represent and uh jesus said ye are the light of the world right praise god so we gotta let her shine you know let's let's never be ashamed praise god of people knowing that you're a christian amen you come around my area and people that know me you ask him am i a christian and let them answer the question for you matter of fact i'll give you a one little illustration you know uh we've got a couple of dogs that only keep golden retrievers but i we keep a few and we love them all we love doing the best you know and uh they usually miss me when i'm away but the thing is that uh i my boss came on the phone and i was answering the phone and of course the dogs had heard the phone ringing so they have to chirp up and they're all parking their heads up they're doing that they're barking about it but they're all bargaining and i i so i said be quiet you know the word listening they're still barking i'm saying excuse me excuse me and i said shut up well you know what that's a language understand you know so i i went back on the phone brother my boss says charge and i said yes she said that's the first time i've heard you raise your voice in nine years and actually my dog will understand you you say go home go home and just look up you know he's like go home get you know brother branham said there was seven church jesus in the old testament often worked it right and i'll tell you one thing i'm not gonna do it for you this morning because i'm you know i'm just not going to do it but if there's seven churches there have to be seven churches messengers amen i think truly and when i thought about it i'm not gonna go to the night but you know i mean moses moses and paul go along so so well because moses wrote the first five books and paul wrote the the two thirds of the new testament or whatever it was and uh you know the first church messenger we know john the baptist uh uh finished it up and we know brother branham finished the larger change so you can work out the rest for yourself i'll tell you what i could i could go through it and i'll tell you i've got a good idea of who them church messengers were i just got a little a little dirt in my mind you know because elijah uh brown said that the the the dark ages and the old testament was was right there under that king ahab amen so anyway we'll we'll leave that praise the lord and uh just go on but the branches the shafts the knots the little balls the flowers and the buds each group of three and three and three nine and complete everything's complete everything speaks to you everything is complete amen is the most beautiful thank praise the lord and the natural amen and uh nine at this fruit of the spirit amen completeness praise god do not tear fruit of the spirit there are nine for the spirit and the nine gifts of the spirit amen nine gifts also of the spirit meaning complete amman is complete praise the lord and i've always believed in the gifts of the spirit folks because you do not go one of the the brother whose wife as mother was raised his 12 year old girl they were in a village and the witch doctor put a curse on her and she died at 12 years of age and i was able to tell brother timothy where she is praise god amen where she is today she's in at the opening today hallelujah and he was so happy amen to know hallelujah that she's under that power of fire this morning and uh that that is wonderful but you know you cannot go to a place like that if you're not prepared to meet the devil amen and if he's going to go toe to toe with you you have to be prepared to to take him on amen and we're not afraid to do that because creator is he that's in us that he that's in the world so if you're in a job or something someone's getting on your back now why would i say that this morning amen you see and someone's getting on your back or the neighbors being nasty to you or something greater is he that is in you that he that is in the world praise god you just keep going being a christian amen and you will get the victory hallelujah i remember i know i'm not gonna tell you i'm gonna tell you one illustration but i'll leave that amen and uh praise the lord even on the main shaft there's four groups of nuts and bolts four groups of flowers and buds and you've got twelve just even in the main stem which speaks of christ when you're talking about the rest of the things and uh 12 is divine government amen divine government you've got the twelve apostles of the lamb the twelve trades of israel and there was twelve baskets full praise alone and it never misses brother brother said god's mathematics are correct hallelujah and so they are amen and it all sings that they were they were beasts uh maybe before i don't know but but aaron's rod that that the buddha amen speaking of the resurrection that this seemed to be based on that uh that three amen not that almond tree whatever it was these were put together and this in this shape and form but completely beautiful uh i'm sorry these are a little bit more than tour but but i mean that's beautiful if you want to have a look at that later it's so beautiful praise god the workmanship that that went into it amen and anyway let's go on praise god that uh uh so and there was 66 and all amen and we've got our 66 books of the bible amen now i praise the lord there was three million knots amen and the center one and they were supported they supported the six branches going out amen and of course that speaks of us as our own godhead amen not not three separate gods but one god and three officers amen and of course we looked at the lampstands the church ages and complete and perfect amen the churches are complete and perfect jesus is the light of the world and number 10 there was ten lampstands in the temple right five down this way five down that way amen and uh praise the lord and the in the tabernacle there was one just one christ but here there was five on each side that's ten and that speaks of the speaks of the uh the the church of jesus christ amen and ten in the scripture is the number of divine law amen will just got it right amen they're not 11 not 12 there's 10 divine law as in the ten commandments as in that ten lepers were healed amen the divine lord to heal the ten right amen and the disciples with it ten days for the coming of the holy spirit just after the law comes grace and it's also beautiful amen after the ascension amen they win at the ten days right praise the lord and uh divine law and order then grace and of course also a ten is the number of responsibility and i'm just going to give you a little quote out of revelation again in a moment but 10 is the number of responsibility and we know that because it was 10 virgins right amen they were responsible they were responsible as we often were talking even now over the time that god has no grandchildren right amen we're all responsible here today it's not your mom it's not your god it's you hallelujah you've got to meet god yourself and the god that i'm talking about is a stranger and i'm leaving you today you're going to have to to to have oil in your room amen praise god and then finally amen will if you've got ten uh ten uh uh candlesticks at all and uh you multiply that by seven little branches each you've got 70 and and 70 is always in the bible the number prior to increase amen amen and uh the 70 sons of jacob went into egypt amen prior to the killing within 70 souls and they come out like 2 million or something that's what the prophet said and then we know that to be true amen and so praise the lord there were 70 pounds of elim and they were 70 years in exile amen you know that jeremiah said you'll be there and and that temple amen jerusalem fell the temple was destroyed 586 amen right bc and because you're working backwards it was restarted again and in 5 16 amen and if you take that just a simple calculation you'll see that 70 years right amen and so the the mathematics are absolutely pure and true nine the improvement of the seven lumps that's what it's called when a priest if it was my uh a duty to look after the candelabra or the menorah uh or the menorahs as it was in the temple um amen uh i'll show you the position they were in a moment but it's called the improvement of the lungs so that's probably what you'd have been getting you know next week you'll be on the improvement of the lunch you know so praise the lord and as a priest we've got to keep the improvement of the lambs amen and of course if you think about the god that we know and look at all them the stars and space and harborings just burning around amen and perfect harmony you know you see that god is a god of harmony and perfection amen and he just does not do anything uh like haphazard right you know what i mean it's all ordered hallelujah by the lord amen and the candelabra it was i think it was uh it tells you it's eighteen hundredths now as someone said to me a home breath says four inches and might be but i think it may have been a little bit bigger than six foot because they had three steps of ascension amen praise the lord the three steps of attention and uh when the in the old testament talks about going up to the menorah it meant one two three amen so that's the way they did it amen and by the priest and you are a priest today amen and praise the lord you go up amen and you wrote eye level with this here amen you're not looking down trying to light it like that that's the way the catholic priest does it but you are laid it amen at eye level amen and you clean it all at eye level and put in the new uh uh things in it at that level amen and so amen now let me see here praise the lord it says in numbers it says aaron we're now lightest alums the seven lamps shall give light over the menorah on an exodus on you shall make the seven lobster off and the light of the seven lumps they're off that they may light over against it that it may shine towards the center no i what i'm doing and i'm just building you right up here for because i want to bring this into the message amen i want to show you something that happened to bring it into our day and to our edge amen praise the lord that's amen that my leg toward the center so that all lit would give a glorious light right across the whole of the holy uh place amen and of course we shouldn't even have to be told that the oil that pure olive oil that was used is a type of the holy ghost amen hallelujah and you we need your oil every day amen not just sunday morning monday morning praise god when you go to work when you come back from work in the house doing your dishes whatever you're doing you need the oil hallelujah to keep you burning amen praise god amen uh if i may just read this here amen to you praise god and uh i just want you to listen to this and you know you will get it praise the lord amen now the priest here when he comes in in the morning time and he look up the first thing you do look at the candelabra and he'll see if anyone have went out okay now i'm going to bring in a few little things here but he would see a better one and he just didn't start anywhere this was all ordered amen i mean he started and i had a fashion and uh so uh he he always divided that's why i called it the lighting of the lumps five and two he always divided his work between five and two he was either working with the two of them or he was working with a five now in the morning okay if the two were left he would immediately snowbird number five clean them all up fill them with oil and re-kindle them that's what he did amen and uh then even if the two had gone out and the five were lit he would still have done that he worked on the five uh at the start amen and i want to bring in that i hope you're with me that you can right away say well five is grace just keep that in thought five is grace hallelujah amen but that's the way he did it amen and it says even if he enters to find that the other five flames are still burning from the previous day he extinguishes them and replaces their oil and wicks uh and and and fills them again and rekindles them that's what he did now can you follow that so far okay amen now then you say what about the other two well if he looks over and says they're burning he lets them keep boarding and they are not touched until all the sacrifices of the day are over he might even be offering other sacrifices or he might be but he didn't touch them amen he didn't touch him until all them animals had been offered on the sacrificial altar amen and that was all done and even it is thought that the incense had already gone up before he worked on these last two amen and you know you look at the little steps baby steps i mean we we we have our sacrifice hallelujah we have the blood sacrifice for ourselves amen we're in a place night where we can pray hallelujah and prayer after that will bring testimony on witness that's the way it will work amen praise the lord right now praise the lord i want to just go on step up a little further here and uh i think we're doing all right for time i'd love to finish early but praise the lord amen amen okay now if you just can't have a look at that there i don't know what way this building's running brother brother dale but it doesn't really matter because that's the front door okay so let's just say uh it might not be but let's just say that's the east okay so that must be the west end and that's the way it is and and the temple and jerusalem amen and it's from east to west okay so if you come in and that door you would find five of these that way there the whole day one five la cantera they wouldn't be pointing that way when you come in the door they would be pointing that way so you'd have to come right okay and there'd be five here five five there amen and uh praise the lord as i say he would look at these five ones here and that's what he would first work on then an evening time he would work at these two because these two were kind of looked upon as special amen and uh praise the lord and let me just read what they say about amen that these flames had to uh be raised up constantly uh before the lord and uh it seems that if they did go out they would be relent amen but these two apparently for a long long time from the when when the altar the first time it came it was closed off the altar god lit that fire and from then on apparently either one of these or the two of them are born perpetually they didn't even have to change it and they would let them keep burning and that was a testimony that god was in with israel hallelujah that the priest could come out and say that is still burning and it was my grandfather's day we haven't put any oil in it we haven't changed the wick it's burning it was called the western candle amen and you know folks like i don't want to take you out of this church but you know something the western brother branham said that's coming from the east and it went to the west hallelujah and it's still burning hallelujah that to this day the light of god amen it was to be perpetual it wasn't the white amen and so uh praise the lord and uh the whole idea was that the improving uh the improvement of the the flames that's what you had been called the task the whole task but these these ones here were the improving of the flames and they happened after the blood sacrifice so you've got that so far it's not it's not too far on you okay praise the lord amen now the western candle yes amen and this this was this was this was quite something here because you can see him here working at the western candle amen so if you're coming in this one here is called the east actually and this is a bit irish to me you know but these two are called the eastern candles okay because they're closest to the east you see when you come in and under so they're closer there's this door you come in and the whole way down these two are closer they have to be closer to the least if they're pointed that way and so but this fella here the second one in was called the western candle you see although it was the too close and they were called the eastern but that one was called the western right now a brother saw me that probably never killed a man with us but if you left dublin airport and went down to the highway and it says sorry and you know i don't want to go outside i want to go north but actually you got to go right down south until you join the road that goes north that's the way it is both of them are called eastern but the one on the inside is called the western the western candle amen and praise the lord that was uh that was the one that had to be perpetually burning and uh well i i i i tell you what i suppose i could make a little uh a quote or not there amen fma as i say uh we just got some some time here amen the western candle uh one of the flames on the menorah the western which i just explained burned perpetually this is what they say and this love was never extinguished but it did it did go out in time so as i say he'd come in and he would work with them two at night after after all the sacrifices he would make sure if they're out they re-lit okay and then all the things burning into one light into one one lampstand amen and so uh here he is and uh it was to rise up constant constantly burning a lump amen and uh you know i was just thinking about it and i'm not here saying this this is a thoughts for you this morning amen that if you looked at it in the seven church ages well we certainly know on the day of pentecost god lit the light hallelujah that was the church he had started amen he certainly did like the light amen and if you looked at that and and the light of what just was said amen which i couldn't prove at all but the thing is that i can take it that that's the way they did it and uh that second what i was thinking well that would have been iranians and uh a perpetual late and brother branham said you know arenas was was the man that set the whole scriptures in order right iran as you ever read his writings he'll tell you that there was not five gospels there was four gospels now that might seem elementary to us but when you go deeper into it hallelujah around that tabernacle you had to for them tribes amen and around the throne you had the cherubims the fourth serbians and it has to be forward and you've got the holy ghost in the mirror you kind of fire gospels why because it's matthew mark luke and john goes to the middle of the book of acts so your your numerology is important hallelujah and it has to be correct amen and so i i was thinking about that and and and i really just did that for us hallelujah and then we could see why he did it right with the revolution we've got and then not only that there but brother brown said iranians taught the rapture like we believe it right he did hallelujah and the thing about it is this that folks that is a perpetual light all right man hey man they're not going to be too different they're going to be two different raptures right then poor are you going to go up first with his left and you know all willy nilly and god said hold on who's coming now it ain't going to work like that hallelujah amen it's a perpetual light hallelujah what a realist believe in his people and we believe i'm the dead in christ shall rise first and then we which elijah shall go to be with the lord i mean we'll meet the lord in there so it's a perpetual life and also he he he he taught the oneness of the godhead right i realized so the thing is amen thank you you know i praise god hallelujah that he had that revelation amen he didn't get sucked into some roman doctrine and you know where is every church in the world today that's hanging under the coattails of the church of rome right amen that's the ones that brought it in at the council of nazia that taught that there was a father son holy ghost and three persons something that the bible has never said i never will say right so he taught that as a perpetual night folks hallelujah whatever then to see uh last year when i left you and i got the dublin my wife was already waiting for me i'm my sister-in-law i could see drove and i changed into my suit and we went down to the israeli embassy i had all my luggage in the back of the car i thought they're going to make it hard for me here because but they didn't they just opened up the gate you're expected come on in so i parked the car jumped up we went through their little security thing not very much i can tell you and we had a little gifts on that the the the security people wanted to look at that and they did but then he brought it up to the ambassador and we were up in a suite and as we talked about the times we'd hired and and a lovely man he came right up the dummy goal and it was wonderful and uh so i was saying you know ambassador there's one thing i want to tell you before you go back to israel and he said yes because i always bring him back to scripture sometimes he would go off into the sector and bring them back again right and anyway it's a good job and i'll tell you what that i said mr ambassador i want you to know some things that i do not believe in a godhead of three persons right right i told him you see i asked and i know you're a good friend of john okay he said yes he said we never say too much about doctrine we're over there i said well i want you to know that the fellow you're talking to believes and the god god of abraham isaac and jacob hallelujah amen i couldn't expect them brother dick to go into the full revolution but i'll tell you what he believes in one god hallelujah they were slaughtered because they believed in one god right and that's the testimony they carried amen and that's the testimony we carry that's the testimony that an iranian amen and burning burning so ever brightly amen praise the lord okay well not doing so bad don't think for time praise the lord five five and two amen no i just so we've got that all laid down for you a little bit of foundation praise the lord you know i'll give you an opportunity here this morning just for a second where in the bible do you read a five and two just think about it no it's not a trick question and the life of jesus there was a time when there was five and two wasn't there what was it that's when a little boy brought his five years and two faces right now i'm not trying to make them in order five rules and two faces but i'm just trying to show you that it was the grace of god and it was a witness hallelujah and a testimony amen and there he was and why did he bring that bread it was that christ could feed a hungry people hallelujah why did he come that he could feed a hungry people amen the true bread of god that came down from heaven john 6 if you're looking it up john 6 33 35 51 read the whole chapter amen i am the true bread that is combined from heaven hallelujah amen and giveth life to the world right praise god you know we were making little jokes and all that but i remember hearing a story one time i don't know if i ever told you but i'll tell you not just very briefly and you know when you're rich and you can do a lot of things so there must have been a big cemetery hell and this little guy must have been a multi-billionaire whatever he was and he loved his gold-plated cadillac he loved that so he decided because money talks he decided that he was going to be buried in his gold plated cadillac well that's his business and so the day the funeral came and they were all organized and there he was he was placed into the front driver's seat hey man probably hold on to the weight don't know what he was going to drive to he's right and so anyway they got him up and it was just too much for one of these great gravediggers you know and there they were lowering them down you know i i this big lip was just lowered them down into the hole and uh one of the gravediggers looked over and the other one he said money said that's what i call living oh boy are you getting young people are you listening this morning i'll tell you something that ain't living you see hallelujah but what is living right why do we hear of the older people and you know millions of people that know the lord this morning is a testimony that there is true breath how are you amen you know when someone said i was reading a little daily reading and as someone went in there a burger king or something and said man he said your hamburgers are awesome well i'll tell you what they make me good but they're not awesome awesome hamburger i mean what's it going to do for you what have you done it's jesus christ the true bread like him died from heaven hallelujah i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger hallelujah hallelujah i am the living bread which came down from heaven out of honeymoon eat this bread he shall live amen forever hallelujah amen we have no doubt in our heart this morning that brother deal catch is with the lord hallelujah he served god as a faithful man i've known him all these years and he's with the lord this morning amen hallelujah and not the orphanage amen but the people of god in the presence of brother branham that's right amen wonderful hallelujah now let me just hit this for a little bit because i'm still getting you trying to get up to this claymax man number two two vicious amen i'm the number of witness and testimony amen and of course uh you know jesus said his disciples are two by two and i'm so glad that brother arthur came with me to this trip to him amen hallelujah and uh there was two witnesses not right moses and elijah the olive tree and that's what i love about that the actual sea of israel it's not the star of david that's the flag but the seal is the two golden olive trees hallelujah that's it moses and elijah praise the lord amen it's so wonderful aren't you glad you're there today actually we've got one of our catches books and it's just called israel and it's got all the quotes amen that he made about israel and it's so wonderful

type of the holy ghost just the type of the holy ghost amen and and the holy ghost here and not kiss would be a double witness to what jesus had just said about being the bread of the true bread of heaven amen praise god and uh of the grace of god amen as christ the true bread of god and when you think about it let me just take you down this path for a little bit when you think about a fish and when i think about a fish it speaks of freedom you know right there goes nobody there to tell it where to go or where not to go amen i can swim wherever it wants hallelujah and that's the same as you

no the pastor put it up and it will stay there as long as the pastor wants it out right if someone comes out of the street and they don't like it that's too bad amen a messenger of our age hallelujah malachi 4. amen that's right that's right the second one john forsen brother branham amen priest god the allege of our day amen the messenger of our lord hallelujah how could we have got it without him right amen praise the lord amen amen well let me just take you up a little bit further today praise the lord amen if i may sure and get you right on to where this came from i did tell you that it was from like brother brother picked up that that that packet that had that written on it the holy spirit had him to do that now when i got that menorah last year and i got these things here uh about the priest and harry did all that i i left other side i read that i said that's very interesting until some of you folks might have that book on the generation isn't it by by angel smith right right but this is where i this is what brought this message into being just a little message for a sunday morning praise god amen and uh uh that's where i got this five and two from and i'm just gonna read where i got it from and then we'll make our conclusions and then we'll we'll stop for lunch amen praise the lord now brother brother says in the book marriage in divorce and may i say this at the very beginning that it's not i'm not thinking about the marriage of marriage and divorce i'm thinking about that but i'm thinking about the whole message right okay so i want you to i'm not here to be preaching about marriage and divorce today but i'm only thinking about the whole message i'm sure you'll understand that my brother gonna say it here in uh in jeffersonville amen in 65 he said now this is to my church only not my church the little flock that believes in me ah on follows me this is to them he said the other day knowing that when i tell you something it must come thus saith the lord right right hallelujah then i have the scriptures as he revealed it to me but lord god what can i say to that congregation that's all you all know they're all messed up and everything thank god that's awesome that night i mean if you follow the word that's true and he said i'll have separations men will be sitting there on the porch and out in the yard and everywhere else and shall i leave her woman what shall i leave my husband what shall i do i said lord what can i do and something said to me go up yonder in the mountains and i'll talk to you praise god so here he is and while i was up in the mountain not knowing and down in tucson they were saying it but even the teachers called the children my little girl and them on the school from the school room and said look up yonder and they're a fiery looking amber crowd up in the air and coming back down and going up on the air and back down and now i want you to notice what but brother branham says here he brings in two witnesses here to this he said mrs evans are you here said brownie that's ronnie evans our son you here i i come on back down to the station this young boy by the filling station evans filling station there and before i know that what the boy was going to say he took me off my feet he said brother branham you was up in that mountain over here there wasn't you see and i said what do you mean ronnie see to see what what he's going to do a lot of times things happen i don't don't say that people are saying and the thing is you see so much happening it becomes common to you see i just didn't tell the people i said ronnie what was you and he said i can show you right where you were at and he pointed up if you've been to tucson some of you have there's a place called finger rock it's just sticks up there not right by the way and it sticks up there in the hill you can't miss it finger rock but we did miss it because brother ken and i was up in this little chestnut or plane or whatever it was apache whatever you call it i don't know and i was taking the point and they said brother george and i said yes he said if you're going to take it you better take it right quick and i just nearly took the top of a finger rock amen and then we went right down into the catalinas on the way up and it was wonderful he let me fly the airplane that day and it was wonderful wonderful i really enjoyed that and so here it was finger rob the little boy uh pointing up the finger lock amen and uh he said uh amen he said night praise the lord so i i said it's got to be brother brown up there and god's talking to him and the whole city looked up you see in that amber cloud seen it like a funnel coming back up and spreading out and down i want to go on a little bit deeper amen i said friends that's when this was being revealed to me when i'm what i'm going to tell you now she's talking about marriage and divorce but i want you to just generalize it the whole message amen because he got it he got the series by revelation he said i didn't know what it was and he got it by revelation praise the lord i'm just going to bring out something that this afternoon amen god willing no i praise the lord amen and he says here i was it's going to be revealed to me and he said i'm speaking to my followers only people in the message and uh a bear me record before god and he said now we find out this mess because of misinterpreted theology look at the many things theology has misinterpreted my mind they tell us so much hallelujah and they kind of they're so blind themselves blind ludacea they cannot see themselves amen praise the lord and here he was and then he talks about how the lord had granted moses a bill of divorcement amen because of the hardness of their heart and my brother brought him to stand up and in that tabernacle and say no i that every one of you here was waiting for this answer that up to that moment right to that moment if you have been married two or three times don't do it again stay with your partner don't leave or not you know the story as well as i do so that got sorted out but never do it again hallelujah so we don't marry twice or three times say man i'll tell you what it's a time that's a dodgy thing praise god you'll never break that claim amen so anyway praise the lord and you know i can even say that we talked about moses we talked about brother branham and you know these men of god do get these things from god right as he said he got it there god was speaking to him okay and when saint patrick was praying for ireland he had a special request to god that no irish man living would serve the antichrist and all i can tell you friends is this that god said i hear your prayer i hear your prayer i've got in my bible here a way back in the psalms or somewhere i got there don't know if i could even get it for you tonight it's but it's in here somewhere last year i've got it written down i've got brother uh raju babu his name on it i've got his little uh wife's name i think it's her rhea she's always corrected me or not and it's ria and they had no child amen and i'll tell you what i was delighted to come back from india last year and brother freddie wrote me this year that she's expecting her first baby amen and i've got it written down and all it was is the lord said i have heard your prayer right here that's all right praise god so it's wonderful hallelujah amen and and patrick got that from god that he heard his prayer no irish man will be living to serve the antichrist on ireland you know why because it will be flooded out right that's why there'll be none there over that great tribulation to serve the antichrist amen i'm so glad about that praise the lord so amen and here it was but i wonder just in the last couple of minutes of the of the ministry this morning and i want you to this is where i found it in that generation book sister evans and brother ronnie evans testimony of what they said and then tied them with what i told you this morning it says one morning welch had gone to the stage and that's her husband and ronnie and i took martha g and my youngest to school it was a beautiful day and there could be some beautiful days in tucson and there was not a cloud in the sky we dropped her off and we're on our way back to the station when ronnie said mama look at the mountains look at them clothes okay clouds not climbing clouds now broadband said cloud and it was a cloud because when you light the seven you get a cloud amen okay and so he says i looked it was right up the place called finger rock and there was this cluster of amber clouds amen and we watched them and sometime there would appear five and here too amen am i reading this right here yes i'm reading right then they changed the rhyme and then there would be two and five you see for about 45 minutes it was strange we sat there and we watched ronnie said i know where brother brown's at it's got to be right up there i said you know only god could do that it's so different i've never seen anything like that amen praise the lord never seen anything like that amen and that is wonderful praise the lord can you see god keeping his same order right as he had there let it in the tabernacle amen he's talking to his prophet right he hasn't changed this wouldn't mean i think i'd say this message people would incur anything you see about that and as i said earlier that first church is he said if you don't repent he said i will remove the candlestick i'll remove the witness right yep that's right and so here you have it email imagine five and two then two and five right now why was it not four and three and and or section one or not because god was keeping his order right that's what as he talked to brother branham and he's talking to us he said i am a god of order hallelujah my message is one hallelujah i'm unchanging my word doesn't change hallelujah how i did it at the beginning the original seed is the same way as it is the whole way through amen and praise the lord amen that's just wonderful praise god amen speaking forth the revelation amen of grace right grace to his bride hallelujah and witness witnessing to it as you have the two amber amber lumps praise god coming up and dying amen so that's just that's where i got them thoughts amen and just to see god keeping his continuity right amen not changing it five and two that's what you saw and then they would all come into one cluster and whatever not and it's beautiful hallelujah that god never changes his order he never changes his way to do things you know folks i think we started somewhere this morning your only belief i tell you what you get me somewhere where it says only believe on right right right god will not change his order amen praise god as you approach him right there in that tabernacle he will not change his order praise god and so it's so wonderful this morning hallelujah i'm glad we've got to go like that that's perfect hallelujah and all things are amen as brother ronald was saying up there i mean god doesn't have to call a crisis meeting we we might have to but i'll tell you what he certainly does not praise god yes amen i wanted i can't imagine one of the angels rolling down and saying uh dear lord you know the americans are in trouble you know their economy is about busted you know and he's still sitting on the throne yeah praise god i'll tell you a little thing that happened what this afternoon going william uh when i i had to go and there was a funeral i went to in a catholic church and i had to take four of our little fellows and their uh autistic fellows uh they wanted to go down to the church so i took them down and then as i said i took them into our tabernacle the next morning praise the lord and it was wonderful to have them there and there they were clapping away and thank this was great you know and they really enjoyed it i don't think they knew what they're saying about it but they really enjoyed it and i just said to the people you know i i read it up from the prophet he said that autistic people and down syndrome people like that have a special amen praise god and so thank god that they've got that special and they got that special relationship amen and i can trust the lord with them all well they love us dearly you know and uh they love to see us coming in and it'll be sad when i finish up there but i will be finishing up praise the lord did you get something this morning amen bless god hallelujah amen praise the lord amen amen praise the lord jesus gracious heavenly father again lord jesus we come father just at the end of this morning serve us and lord we thank you father god for your word we thank you lord right and not that desert amen many are of lord caravans perhaps passed it i never passed a bit of notice about it lord they would see a fence they would see a can of a a dark-colored kind of a tent over there beyond the seven foot fence but lord many would not have realized what was dwelling and not tempted that tent carried the shekinah glory of your own person lord that ark of the covenant that mercy seat where you dwelt and where the blood was shed father we're so thankful and lord i pray with all my heart as our heads are burned this morning lord that you will speak to every heart lord if someone hasn't been baptized or hasn't come and committed themselves to the lord father i just think back there just before i came here her my own niece's husband lord we were talking i'm lord har he just went home that night and gave his heart to christ lord granted the whole way through the building that we may all know that we're going in that rapture lord and so father god also you know those that need your touch this morning lord that fathers are just sitting in the seats lord we just pray that your holy spirit will touch us as you pass by yes amen and lord jesus we do pray for brother terence and sister lisa today dear god may your sweet holy spirit just be a comfort that we could never be and lord may you help them through this time i thank you for your anointing on that lord that prayer i thank you for it lord and i do believe you will anoint them dear servants of yours so lord we just pray that you will bless us now lord as we come to the end of this particular service lord that you will be with us lord until we meet again and father god let us feed on these spiritual things feed on these things lord amen and father god we believe lord we've something most beautiful lord in the afternoon as well so dear god have your way and bless us dearly for we ask it in the precious name of the lord jesus christ amen you know all the things and you wonder why did this have to be that way now but you know i was thinking while he's preaching is to show that god will keep his word right he will keep his word but if he makes all of that work and makes everything has to be done exactly right amen you'll keep his word that's right exactly thank god for that yeah just tell brother quinn how much you appreciate it anybody have a need to order something six five nine six i hear the call oh control i me and times things are falling apart all the way around the world that's where it's supposed to be we're supposed to be in that hour right now we're not happy about it we're just happy that we know the truth right and the truth before we go it i know is is he was oh oh two o'clock oh oh he speaks to me and i am oh i know he speaks to me lord please come and take control lord please come and take control i'll be
