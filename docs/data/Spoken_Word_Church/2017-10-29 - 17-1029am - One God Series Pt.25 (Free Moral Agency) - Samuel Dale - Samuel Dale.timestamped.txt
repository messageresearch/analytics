[5:53] we had a great time yesterday to the
[5:56] Fall Festival we had to have everything
[5:59] inside cause it was raining but that
[6:01] still made it everybody they had the

[6:10] people fixing you know and doing the
[6:12] things and in getting everything to
[6:15] where they could play the games and then
[6:17] those that were doing the games and do
[6:19] it in the cooking and the food and
[6:22] everything we appreciate everything it
[6:25] was great
[6:25] but is that a good time in - now
[6:29] remember there will be no Bible study
[6:32] this coming first Saturday because
[6:36] everybody's going to be gone waiting
[6:38] there's going to be gone - brother Tim
[6:41] hymns and a lot of people are going so
[6:44] we'll just not have that one this month
[6:46] on the Bible study so remember that the
[6:50] fellowship meeting will be the third
[6:52] Saturday that brother Tony's I think
[6:56] that's what about the 19th but any has a
[6:58] third Saturday and I also remember that
[7:01] the other announcements Terrence made
[7:03] them this morning
[7:04] get the announcements of when the
[7:07] Thanksgiving is coming when the
[7:09] Christmas parts coming and all of the
[7:11] things and we just decided that they're
[7:14] the Christmas will Christmas Eve will
[7:17] fall on the 24th which is on Sunday so
[7:20] we're going to have that week a Saturday
[7:22] night service on the 23rd all right so
[7:27] that will be on the 23rd of December the
[7:30] Saturday night service instead of having
[7:32] one on the Sunday because you know
[7:34] because everybody is going with their
[7:36] families and doing and everything like

[7:59] arrangements find out who's going to do
[8:01] what just contact these brothers and and
[8:04] try to get everything figured out

[8:21] family pray that the Lord would be with
[8:24] each one if she was about 90 something

[8:30] good to her so everything you know and

[8:38] on and we'll get to meet them later on
[8:40] all right amen all right John 1 and
[8:43] Joshua 24 father we thank you for this
[8:49] day in your grace Lord and we thank you
[8:51] for the opportunity to be able to set
[8:55] aside a day and just take a little time
[8:57] Lord that we can just fellowship with
[9:00] you around your word we ask you to bless
[9:03] each one remember all of the sick among
[9:05] us you promised it so you said you send
[9:08] your word and heal us and deliver us
[9:10] from destruction so touch each one
[9:12] there's many many sicknesses - Anna
[9:14] called us sick this morning Lord and
[9:17] just be with each one have your way Lord
[9:20] that your Grace and love may be
[9:22] sufficient for ever need that we have as
[9:24] we read your word you come and speak to
[9:27] us about it and guide us all in Jesus
[9:29] name John 1 in the beginning was the
[9:39] word and the Word was with God and the
[9:42] Word was God
[9:43] the same was in the beginning with God
[9:45] all things were made by him and what
[9:48] without him was not anything made that
[9:51] was made
[9:52] in him was life and the life was the
[9:55] light of men like Shina 'then darkness
[9:57] and the darkness comprehended it not
[10:00] nellis
[10:01] go to Joshua 24 and this is the time you
[10:07] know and it's kind of God reminding
[10:10] Israel of the things that they've done
[10:13] in all like that in showing and bringing
[10:17] forth Abraham
[10:19] I like verse 3 there of 24 said I took
[10:23] your father Abraham from the other side
[10:25] of the fluid that's a pretty good
[10:28] predestination and but anyhow let's go
[10:31] over about verse 12 and he's talking
[10:35] about the things that he done to the /
[10:37] Canaanites virgins I see Hittites and
[10:39] all like that and how he delivered the
[10:41] people and I said to Hornet before you
[10:44] which drove them out from before you
[10:46] even the two kings of the a mirage but
[10:49] not with thy sword nor with my boast he
[10:53] had done the whole thing yourself okay
[10:55] and I've given you a land for which he
[10:58] did not labor the cities which you build
[11:01] not and you dwell in them are the
[11:05] vineyards and the olive yards which you
[11:09] planted not do you eat now therefore
[11:12] fear of the Lord and serve Him in
[11:14] sincerity and in truth and put away the
[11:17] gods which your father's served on the
[11:19] other side of the flood and then Egypt
[11:22] and serve you the Lord and if it seem
[11:25] evil unto you to serve the Lord watch
[11:30] what he's saying now putting it plain to
[11:31] him choose you this day whom you will
[11:37] serve whether the gods which your
[11:40] father's served that we're on the other
[11:42] side of the fluid are the gods of the
[11:44] Emirates and whose land you dwell with
[11:47] as for me in my house we will serve the
[11:50] Lord you may be seated
[11:51] the Lord had his blessing to the reading
[11:55] of the word all right now we spent quite
[12:02] a time there this past Wednesday in
[12:06] referencing to the fall and bringing
[12:13] down and trying to get a good under
[12:15] standing and remember our main thought
[12:17] was that so we look at the fall as
[12:23] trying to figure out what happened or
[12:26] what caused or what took place or
[12:29] whatever you know and we're always
[12:32] trying to figure things out but remember
[12:36] the main point was that God cannot
[12:42] create anything wrong it doesn't matter
[12:46] what now there's no way that God can
[12:49] create anything wrong
[12:51] so then you say well what he done he
[12:54] created Eve this way or that way
[12:58] are you making some kind of a defect and
[13:03] I was bringing out Wednesday are you
[13:04] making some kind of a something that
[13:07] would cause her to do wrong are you
[13:13] trying to make it that away you know are
[13:16] you trying to make some thing that God
[13:19] done to her see that's not the point
[13:25] because we found out it's not the point
[13:27] of what she was doing or whatever we'll
[13:30] get back to that because there's only
[13:33] one sin and that's unbelief the acts and
[13:36] the things that happen is the display of
[13:40] unbelief or an attribute all right see
[13:45] then it's not on that basis of trying to
[13:47] think about her being made some way so
[13:51] she could do this I told you over and
[13:57] over and I've had always have that the
[14:00] only thing that I see that Eve was
[14:02] created in any way was the fact of her
[14:05] to be a mother right her to be a mother
[14:11] that would put a desire into her heart
[14:14] to be a mother to you know how children
[14:17] to do things and there's nothing wrong
[14:20] with that it was placed in the animals
[14:24] to have children there's nothing wrong
[14:27] with that
[14:29] we'll see don't get it into our eyes I
[14:32] mean our spiritual life thinking that
[14:37] you know something was made different is
[14:42] what I've drove over and over and over
[14:43] to you see that something was made to
[14:49] purposely to do this alright then see we
[14:55] we've been we'll we'll go to those lines
[14:57] and we'll spend our time trying to study
[15:01] some form or thought and we come up with
[15:04] doctrines and ideas and you know how
[15:07] they doing the message all you got to do
[15:09] is throw out something and here they go
[15:11] and they start running and you know
[15:13] everybody's got this idea about it and
[15:15] that idea about it all I can't but just
[15:18] remember we're not trying to argue ideas
[15:22] nor thoughts and I have no problems with
[15:27] anybody trying to I have never tried to
[15:31] straighten anybody out see that's what a
[15:34] lot of preachers say boy I straightened
[15:37] them out I've never had that thought in
[15:39] my mind it's not in my mind's eye view
[15:42] never has been to try to straighten
[15:44] somebody else it's try to help try to do
[15:48] the best I can to help you to get you to
[15:51] see things the way God wants it not
[15:55] something to try to straighten you out
[15:57] because that way we just get to an
[15:59] arguing with each other and it's it's no
[16:01] good but to put it to a basis that we
[16:04] try our best and I don't believe rudder
[16:06] Branum you know was that away
[16:10] I remember him making a statement one
[16:12] time and and he said oh I wanted that so
[16:15] much and then he stopped or something
[16:16] like that and he said you know I
[16:18] shouldn't talk to him he was just honest
[16:23] he he wasn't trying to straighten out
[16:26] anything he was trying to tell the truth
[16:29] about God in His ways and that's all
[16:32] that I've ever tried to do to get you to
[16:35] see the real thing so then we know it
[16:38] for a certainty that God cannot create
[16:41] it
[16:42] and anything wrong there was nothing
[16:44] wrong with Adam and his creation and
[16:47] remember if you say Adam was created
[16:50] perfect now listen to the point if you
[16:53] say Adam was created perfect but he was
[16:56] created a little imperfect
[16:59] now remember then Adam wasn't perfect Oh
[17:08] because if Eve was an Adam the little
[17:11] imperfect you think trying to make out
[17:14] would make Adam not perfect so you
[17:17] understand what I'm saying
[17:19] I try to get things like that to where
[17:21] your mind will think instead of trying
[17:24] to house it you're brainy ideas and
[17:26] thoughts because we'll get more to it
[17:28] Wednesday night on the the points of
[17:32] reasoning factors and stuff like that
[17:34] and watch how that it'll come right down
[17:38] to where it is because remember the
[17:41] point I kept making whatever the
[17:45] original fallen condition whatever you
[17:51] want to talk about it being it's still
[17:55] here now the original sin whatever it
[18:00] was is still here now right and if
[18:07] that's true then she didn't why not just
[18:12] look around you know just look around
[18:17] where we're at and think about ourselves
[18:21] it would sure help to understand what
[18:24] took place in the garden see we look at
[18:27] the things like we throw off on the
[18:29] people for saying that Eve ate an apple
[18:32] or this that of the other we go off on
[18:34] them but see then we'll turn around and
[18:38] say well it was this it was that would
[18:42] you just remember whatever eating Apple
[18:44] would have been would have been an
[18:45] attribute of something whatever you want
[18:48] to call it over here back between the
[18:50] even the beasts that's an attribute
[18:55] that's not a sin you remember brother
[19:01] branham was preaching so much about you
[19:02] know this wasn't saying that once then
[19:04] that lady said pray tell what is sin he
[19:07] said it's unbelief because you cannot do
[19:12] anything wrong until you first turn down
[19:17] the Word of God all right so then it
[19:21] lays in the basis of sin that when Eve
[19:24] accepted Satan's lie and I wish you'd
[19:28] listen to that message over and over
[19:30] because my emphasis was how small a
[19:34] thing it was that she done you know we
[19:43] always want to look at some great big
[19:44] outlandish nothing it was so small and
[19:48] so close to the truth
[19:55] were they not told to multiply and
[20:00] replenish the earth did not the Prophet
[20:06] as we'll go back to it again today
[20:10] didn't he say that he Eve would have
[20:13] finally brought that child oh no that
[20:20] can't be because of this then what are
[20:24] you dealing with just remember you're
[20:28] dealing with Almighty God not human
[20:31] terminologies that's no good you're
[20:34] dealing with what God says about
[20:36] something and what a prophet says about
[20:38] it or else why believe a prophet if
[20:43] you're not gonna believe what he said
[20:45] what I just know that ain't got nothing
[20:48] to do with it you don't understand it
[20:49] that's the sin that was in the garden
[20:52] that he didn't understand it we'll get
[20:57] to that Wednesday morning she didn't
[20:59] understand it that's exactly the same
[21:01] thing for you to sit and say I don't
[21:03] understand it
[21:07] why not we've had 50 years since the
[21:12] passing of the prophet or at least how
[21:17] the intellectual part of our minds set
[21:21] in the category afterward God can use
[21:24] them right at least by now but see I
[21:33] kept emphasizing the point what Eve
[21:39] doubted brother Branham said when the
[21:41] message all things are possible him that
[21:44] believeth Eve doubted God's Word that
[21:51] was the original sin was to doubt God's
[21:56] Word now what's the difference in that
[22:00] today you come up to somebody you talk
[22:04] to him about God and things you know and
[22:07] then then you mentioned water baptism
[22:09] how do you argue about - oh we're
[22:12] baptized according to the Bible oh yes
[22:18] it says in Matthew 28:19 the baptized in
[22:23] the name of the Father the Son and of
[22:25] the Holy Ghost you say yeah but that's
[22:31] not what I'm saying
[22:36] that's your interpretation of what it's
[22:39] saying because it's saying Lord Jesus
[22:43] Christ what do we say there in there in
[22:51] unbelief right they don't believe the
[22:55] truth moving a little more into closer
[23:01] in the Word of God we might find out
[23:05] there's a whole lot of unbelief left
[23:08] within us
[23:12] right mmm just keep those thoughts we'll
[23:17] try to get some of that Winston but Eve
[23:20] doubted God's Word
[23:23] there was the original sin the profit on
[23:29] the pie the Queen of the South he says
[23:32] talking about sin being unbelief and he
[23:35] said really unbelief is the only sin the
[23:41] only sin there is is unbelief we see we
[23:45] look at it that's hard for us to to get
[23:48] in our minds to think about the unbelief
[23:52] being first we put it all together as
[23:57] one thing we make the act of the even
[24:01] the beast and the unbelieving to be one
[24:04] thing when it's not what she done with
[24:11] the beast was an attribute of the sin
[24:16] that had already entered within her and
[24:23] caused her to do it we play the emphasis
[24:29] the Prophet did on what they she doubted
[24:31] one word all right
[24:35] now what does he go on to emphasize a
[24:38] lot of times with that doubt of one word
[24:41] that if one word brought us out now what
[24:48] did he say
[24:48] he said how do we expect to go back with
[24:52] one word oh you believe you're straight
[24:56] you you don't have one word now the
[25:00] reason we're here is because we do at
[25:02] least have something wrong
[25:03] now let's don't blame God I'm Sonics I
[25:07] can be about that I don't know where
[25:09] it's at and if you'll tell me where it's
[25:10] at
[25:11] I'll ask God to forgive me of that sin
[25:13] of unbelief at that point but I do admit
[25:17] to the human part of it evidently
[25:20] something's wrong
[25:25] no but you know what most of our doing
[25:28] is you know this is true
[25:30] most of our doings and we're waiting on
[25:33] somebody else we're waiting with
[25:35] somebody else to get straight if we
[25:37] could just get these people to we just
[25:39] get the women astray if we can just get
[25:40] this we can just get back how's that
[25:44] true instead of looking at our own
[25:48] selves we remember one word of unbelief
[25:54] to Eve cause the fall what are we going
[26:00] back with any of our thoughts and ideas
[26:01] you see that's why I'm so hard as being
[26:08] you know if I am going to be the pastor
[26:11] I'm going to preach what I believe God's
[26:13] Word is to the closest that I know of it
[26:17] and do the best I can because I'm
[26:20] responsible do you realize that you
[26:25] could go in upon the basis of what I
[26:27] would be saying but I could have an
[26:30] unbelief and miss it and yet you take
[26:36] what is said and go in on it yeah but I
[26:41] don't have no one believe brother Dale
[26:45] what about it hmm do you see Eve never
[26:56] doubted God you remember that one
[26:59] Crescent mister God revealed she had
[27:04] faith in God she never doubted God she
[27:09] didn't say they wouldn't know God she
[27:16] believed in God she had faith in God was
[27:22] she doubted one time who get down to it
[27:26] what did run around and say really is he
[27:27] doubted you know what run around said
[27:31] what eased out was was to doubt Hebrews
[27:34] 13:8
[27:36] he said that's where she was deceived
[27:38] that that's closed it ain't time for us
[27:45] to play and think about her ideas and
[27:48] and now here's the worst thing I'll
[27:50] emphasize this Wednesday because my
[27:52] thoughts here's the worst thing is to be
[27:56] sympathetic to be sympathetic with
[28:04] something is so close until it can take
[28:10] us and that's not realize it oh brother
[28:15] Shawn shows a good brother praise God
[28:18] Alcoholics Anonymous circuit well that's
[28:23] the way they believe praise God we don't
[28:25] have any right to believe right you see
[28:33] the point brother branham on the message
[28:36] queen of the south I'll tell you I'll
[28:39] give these because they're on the
[28:40] internet for them to use where they can
[28:41] do it brother Brennan said it's not a
[28:44] sin for immoral living well let go to
[28:54] the Beast and Eve wouldn't it right was
[29:00] not that immoral living within brother
[29:04] and said that's not sin he said that's
[29:07] an attribute he said the reason you do
[29:09] that
[29:10] he says because you don't believe right
[29:15] so it's not the act in the things that's
[29:21] a display of an unbelief all right now
[29:28] what happened to Eve let's get started
[29:33] on this we'll go ahead and give up
[29:35] brothers they're number five their notes
[29:38] and things and let's just think about
[29:40] some things now and then we're going to
[29:42] get down to a minute to to touch on a
[29:46] little point of free moral agents
[29:51] and try to understand that just a little
[29:54] bit but look what he says he's talking
[30:01] about that's how adults read in other
[30:02] words you know what happened
[30:03] that's how adultery is committed
[30:05] spiritually when you know better by the
[30:08] Word of God by the intercourse of the
[30:10] mind take in a lie of the devil
[30:14] against the Word of God and we're not
[30:17] talking about rape we're not talking
[30:21] about things that people do with drugs
[30:24] to get you we're talking about normal
[30:27] things normal things your prophet will
[30:30] explain it's got a first enter through
[30:33] the mind
[30:39] look alive the devil against the Word of
[30:43] God that's exactly what he's done with a
[30:47] spiritual intercourse first that come by
[30:52] believing Satan lie into the wound of
[30:59] her mind now what does he say that
[31:07] polluted her soul that death in the sold
[31:11] in the natural act implies there will
[31:14] express more in Wednesday some things of
[31:17] soul and spirit and nature and that's
[31:22] the only way that a woman ever can
[31:23] commit adultery against her husband is
[31:26] to first let some man talk her into it
[31:28] then receive another man that's not her
[31:30] husband then she's committed adultery
[31:33] yeah first it has to be in the mind your
[31:43] brain you're taking mechanism whatever
[31:47] you call it and it just keeps dropping
[31:49] downward into the parts of us until it
[31:55] becomes you know to where we live all
[31:59] right but it's got to be first in the
[32:02] mind
[32:06] so then before use
[32:08] Oh can I be plain now we know things
[32:14] happen in life because we're human being
[32:17] okay
[32:18] men women we're human beings and we've
[32:21] done things wrong okay
[32:23] so you want to know what the Prophet is
[32:26] saying dry I mean how do you sisters or
[32:30] to know what the Prophet says is right
[32:34] is that blood but not blurted out you
[32:39] ought to know that first thing had to
[32:41] enter through your mind whether it would
[32:45] be the first night of your wedding or
[32:47] whether it would be in life when you
[32:49] done wrong okay I'm sorry but a blunt is
[32:54] better way all right see it winners into
[32:58] your mind and then it goes from the
[33:04] human mind of sight see tail say taste
[33:08] feel smell hear you know it drops lower
[33:11] into your memory reason conscious
[33:14] sometimes and then it works on out into
[33:16] you but it's first it's got to be in
[33:21] your mind so it wasn't a five-minute a
[33:26] fire with even the beast she may have
[33:33] been talking remember I emphasize Sunday
[33:36] then it wasn't the devil up in a free
[33:38] holler down and talking is she talking
[33:42] to the Beast right but it was the devil
[33:45] to the Beast because the Beast remember
[33:48] was capable of talking he's the closest
[33:52] thing to the human being the only
[33:54] difference was he didn't have a soul all
[33:57] right so then being blind in blunt
[34:05] things first enter through into the mind
[34:09] and then it works out into other things
[34:15] let's see then that's where you make
[34:17] your choice now remember I will get to
[34:25] it probably this maybe Wednesday but
[34:29] remember these two thoughts about choice
[34:35] number one your choice is to believe
[34:38] God's Word you must make that choice
[34:45] number two is to believe Satan's choice
[34:49] about the word you choose to believe him
[34:53] so we'll get down to that see we get on
[34:56] to so much until we try to place it in
[35:00] the wrong way it's come down to a choice
[35:04] well brother Lu you you mean you believe
[35:07] that we have a choice I've always been
[35:10] told that we didn't have no choice I
[35:16] thought he chose us that's exactly right
[35:23] but you won't ride override your free
[35:26] moral agency you can choose you but he
[35:31] won't override it and make you take it
[35:33] so then you got a choice keep that in
[35:37] mind and don't lose it don't get so much
[35:40] we'll see you can say something bout a
[35:42] choice well he don't understand God
[35:45] chose us and it was settled before the
[35:48] world
[35:48] he chose us it was all over with I
[35:52] always was eternal well I don't I go
[36:01] along with what the Prophet said about
[36:03] the truth of being eternal yeah if you
[36:07] have eternal life the eternal life was
[36:10] eternal yeah I agree with that but I
[36:13] don't agree I we've got to leave it to
[36:15] where it's a free choice yeah but where
[36:17] while we were there in denominations we
[36:21] discussed about choices
[36:23] yeah what good is it choose what choices
[36:27] of what
[36:28] yeah my point is that we've argued all
[36:31] the way down about choice choices are
[36:34] very very essence of all there's no
[36:39] Christianity without choice it's like
[36:43] wait we're talking about Sunday you know
[36:45] saying if God just done it and never
[36:48] brought any sin involved or any devil
[36:51] coming we just be like zombies we
[36:54] wouldn't be making choices we wouldn't
[36:59] be people that we our choice is a
[37:03] wonderful thing we see we get it up but
[37:08] I don't I know where the prophets in it
[37:10] I know where the Bible said it they said
[37:13] we didn't choose him he chose us praise
[37:17] God we believe but just remember why did
[37:23] he choose you because he knew knew you
[37:27] would choose him am i right a simple
[37:32] Christianity and he knew you would
[37:35] choose him so then that was the choice
[37:37] before the world well I just don't have
[37:40] nothing to do with it free moral agency
[37:42] it's not for the bride you ever heard
[37:45] that one you ever heard the preachers
[37:48] preach on how that it's not a free moral
[37:51] agency it's all settled and done you
[37:57] don't have a free moral agency you're in
[37:59] that shape and remember free moral
[38:01] agency is what gives you a choice okay
[38:07] keep that thought before said but
[38:12] anytime a woman takes a wrong step she
[38:17] has to first receive it in her mind this
[38:20] is still often spoken word reading on CD
[38:23] so slicker has to precise weighed her
[38:26] when she listens to it against her own
[38:29] better judgment then the act is
[38:35] committed so first it hit
[38:40] seyton hit Eve's mind and in the wound
[38:45] of her mind she doubted God's Word then
[38:49] come the actual seed our is the original
[38:58] sin of unbelief we're not even into the
[39:06] literal acts or anything we're talking
[39:08] about first what happens it has to be a
[39:15] spiritual talk through your mind to go
[39:20] through the rest of you to bring your
[39:22] body into subjection yeah yeah I love
[39:33] this one I've quoted this quote of many
[39:38] a time but most people don't read the
[39:42] whole thing but around says Eve since
[39:47] but confused on one promise then he's
[39:57] the same yesterday today and forever
[40:00] so you know what that means is exactly
[40:04] what I said while ago whatever the
[40:07] original was whatever the first unbelief
[40:11] was it still comes down to you and me
[40:14] are facing the same thing this day
[40:23] remember what did he want wisdom what is
[40:27] the great thing today wisdom all we know
[40:33] more what is we talking about he was
[40:37] saying you know oh that beasts you just
[40:39] preach into it remember she just
[40:44] appreciated to him like everything cuz
[40:46] that's what she wanted to do and
[40:48] remember she is a woman Andrew
[40:53] member she is a type of Christ in the
[40:56] church so we should take that doubt to
[41:00] consideration
[41:02] whatever you original sinner thoughts
[41:05] are it will finally come to show up into
[41:09] the right across you can see how easily
[41:18] Satan can deceive the people of this
[41:22] endtime message if you don't think it's
[41:29] deceiving look at a lot of fun today
[41:30] going you Internet's and check
[41:32] everything 40 years or something
[41:35] somebody's priest floor by screen bite
[41:39] and everything in the book the prophets
[41:42] messages right didn't turn around
[41:45] and deny ever be that now that's what
[41:51] you call it deception right I mean they
[41:56] life and make fun of them and gonna call
[41:58] a name but one of the brothers it was
[42:01] with brother Branham that he called his
[42:02] name constantly we talked to brother you
[42:05] called his name in but we talked to this
[42:07] brother about this other brother and
[42:10] asked kind of what was he doing he said
[42:12] oh six months I had two brother around I
[42:13] said he went back to denominations well
[42:18] said we make light of that you know what
[42:23] would that something he stayed with the
[42:25] Prophet he seen all and died they need
[42:28] to go back to the denomination well
[42:33] what's the difference in going back to
[42:34] one and never coming out of them right
[42:39] you know denominations is ideas
[42:43] what about not never coming out of them
[42:47] but look I want to get this point right
[42:51] here see II stopped
[43:01] and didn't wait brother branham said it
[43:04] seems to presented to him with the
[43:07] versus faith she presented to satan and
[43:10] then she stopped to wait to see what
[43:12] he'd say she presented we could need a
[43:17] better tree with this one tree then she
[43:19] stopped to see what he would say it's
[43:25] always been to stop and wait right got a
[43:29] whole lot in here us where that was the
[43:32] problem one was she couldn't wait for
[43:39] God to fulfill his word what about us
[43:42] oh man I can well so remember when the
[43:47] 70s begin to hit and the people of this
[43:50] message then when it pi 77 boy that just
[43:54] went haywire it was dusts at the Lord it
[44:01] was coming got to be here got to be here
[44:04] and then after no I'm not doing no joke
[44:07] I'm telling the truth after it wound up
[44:10] in 77 pi style they saying brother runs
[44:12] message wouldn't nothing but the devil
[44:15] because he wouldn't ride come on church
[44:22] time we wake up alright what about it
[44:29] go ahead and pull it up number seven the
[44:31] god of this evil aid we're right around
[44:34] talks about that she was yeah but I want
[44:38] you to read all the way down you'll see
[44:43] the same sin is sitting right before you
[44:46] and I that was before Eve the reader we
[44:56] find now this evil age is to prove to
[44:59] Satan the bride is to prove to Satan
[45:07] what
[45:11] that she is not that type of a woman you
[45:18] know even all of the things in the world
[45:20] and situation denominations and she'll
[45:25] be tried by his word or you think we've
[45:28] been doing 50 years I glory in it myself
[45:31] I didn't want it to come this far but
[45:41] you know yourself its own record in 1974
[45:46] I proved by brother branham's message
[45:48] and the Bible that we could pass the
[45:51] Year 2026 and not break the message the
[45:57] people don't want to hear like that oh
[46:01] it was all over in 77 yeah well I'm
[46:06] still here what are they doing I love it
[46:12] she will be tried by his word what a
[46:20] wonderful garden knows how to try his
[46:21] breath see the bride as Adams ride was
[46:24] tried by the word and that of his bride
[46:27] believed every bit of the word all but
[46:30] confused on one promise that he's the
[46:40] same yesterday today and forever in
[46:43] other words he would keep his word
[46:46] now watch the rest of the park just
[46:49] remember all she was but confused on one
[46:54] promise the Hebrews 13:8 was written
[47:00] back tire and get the point
[47:07] she was confused on the fact that God
[47:09] wouldn't keep his word that would make
[47:12] him Hebrews 13:8 right whatever he was
[47:19] he still is and always will be so listen
[47:23] to the partner Adams bride believed ever
[47:26] been in the word all but confused on one
[47:29] promise listen he's the same yesterday
[47:33] today and forever
[47:35] but failed on one promise then what was
[47:41] that promise
[47:46] what was that promise that she failed on
[47:50] I preached it Wednesday night over and
[47:55] over well what was the promise when
[48:01] random relates it to Hebrews 13:8
[48:03] because it is what the word says the
[48:08] promise that he promised dire is the
[48:11] entire Bible tied together to show that
[48:14] he's the same yesterday today and
[48:17] forever
[48:19] she didn't doubt Hebrews 13:8 it wasn't
[48:25] written she doubted the promise what was
[48:30] the problem
[48:32] come on he's the same yesterday then too
[48:35] but failed on one promise under the
[48:38] temptation of enemy face-to-face and now
[48:40] the people that's called for his name of
[48:43] course is his bride she used to come
[48:47] into contact again by the same thing one
[48:51] promise what is the promise not by just
[48:57] denominational truth or something
[48:59] whatever word thank God we're gonna be
[49:05] tried by every word now if you believe
[49:09] when I was preaching a few weeks ago the
[49:15] fact that God which would be better for
[49:18] God to a done
[49:20] let us come without any problems any
[49:24] trouble to anything he would have been
[49:26] our Father cause he would have created
[49:28] us he could have give us eternal life we
[49:30] would have been his children but that
[49:34] wouldn't his plan and purpose would
[49:37] remember you know what his plan and
[49:40] purpose was a promise that he made he
[49:48] made a promise to Adam and Eve what was
[49:55] that promise
[50:01] yeah just a simple question if I said a
[50:06] brother down for deep we don't
[50:07] understand him we can't follow him
[50:09] Cody said of this and he said that we
[50:12] said we can't understand I just asking a
[50:13] simple question what was the promise
[50:18] that God made to Adam and Eve
[50:25] he made that promise before the foul
[50:32] what did he promise them according to
[50:39] Genesis 1:26 and 27 and 28 you City the
[50:45] story we dwell on 1:26 and 27 because of
[50:50] it being the creation right of who the
[50:55] one seed which is Christ according
[50:57] Galatians 3:16 because not many seeds
[51:03] was promised but what is chapter 28 I
[51:06] mean verse 28 say multiply and replenish
[51:11] the earth now brother Branham say it go
[51:20] in spoke a word original seed and listen
[51:22] he said if that had been kept they would
[51:27] have never been a problem you see I put
[51:35] a lot of emphasis on it Wednesday but
[51:37] I'm wondering did you follow it
[51:48] did you follow it the salt go ahead
[51:54] number eight taken from wisdom versus
[52:02] faith he said soak like the seed word
[52:07] cannot grow in the atmosphere of under
[52:10] knowledge and things right he can't grow
[52:13] under that and as soon as knowledge
[52:18] mixes with faith it dies right there not
[52:21] knowledge faith ok Eve come and said the
[52:27] Lord said the day we eat thereof that
[52:30] day we die then she stopped to see what
[52:34] he would say to the Beast he said but
[52:44] listen my dear you lovely little thing
[52:50] she surely God made you for a purpose
[53:00] you know he knew about multiply and
[53:02] replenish the earth right
[53:04] Satan knew about that come on
[53:11] you were made for this purpose that's
[53:15] what it is you don't know it now but you
[53:19] were made for this purpose oh you're a
[53:22] lovely little thing dear look look at
[53:26] those dainty little hands you know what
[53:29] I think about that I think about that
[53:31] one we're brother Reynolds saying to
[53:33] that girl see why do you like that boy
[53:35] said he ain't nothing but a scoundrel
[53:37] don't believe the word said why do you
[53:39] got she said Oh said he's got the
[53:42] prettiest little feet and said he smells
[53:46] so good you don't see what the fall was
[53:52] from a lot of silly stupid things yeah
[53:57] I'll say it again
[54:00] remember where you come from remember
[54:07] where you sold your virginity you're a
[54:17] lovely little thing but he said if we if
[54:20] we did we die now that's not him say it
[54:24] but he said they should have paragraph
[54:25] to stop that but he said if we if we did
[54:30] we die she said she said that did we die
[54:34] me I don't have no education but I got
[54:37] sense he said but old you think that's a
[54:41] good think that a good loving father God
[54:46] would do a thing like that
[54:50] what'd she do she listened to reason
[54:54] took his wisdom said it's a tree delight
[54:59] one can be desired of it and she fell
[55:03] for it that's exactly when she did what
[55:05] happened like it would to any woman as
[55:09] soon as you fall for it
[55:11] it's finished right there you don't have
[55:16] to go remember remember the scripture
[55:20] the Bible does not say in the Old
[55:23] Testament it said if you committed
[55:28] adultery goes wrong right that's the Old
[55:32] Testament but what's the New Testament
[55:34] say if you look on the woman to lust
[55:37] after in your heart what does it say
[55:39] you've done you've already committed
[55:42] adultery no that's what he's saying once
[55:48] it's accepted once Eve accepted that and
[55:53] said that does look good that was it
[55:57] right there that's all it took I was
[56:01] made for that purpose and I have this
[56:03] motherly instinct about me of wanting
[56:07] children and looking at the animals and
[56:09] they have children they have offspring
[56:11] but we don't have any
[56:14] that's all it took the act was an
[56:19] attribute because he said it's finished
[56:25] and watch it now you see the seed that
[56:28] she was holding now I didn't write the
[56:34] book I just read you see the seed that
[56:40] she was holding and would have finally
[56:44] become a mother watch by the will of God
[56:52] to a spoken word she would have a cold
[57:00] mother she was holding to see white seed
[57:06] you get over to Genesis what 3:15 I'll
[57:09] put in in between you guys see the seed
[57:11] of the woman the promise of the coming
[57:13] of Jesus Christ
[57:14] well I don't see I Eve could have
[57:17] produced Christ
[57:20] well we didn't need it anyway because
[57:22] he'd be the savior even see you got it
[57:25] all of your philosophies your ideas but
[57:31] you don't listen to the word she would
[57:37] have finally become a mother which you
[57:40] couldn't wait went him today what was
[57:46] the promise that we read up there
[57:52] then we emphasized that she failed on
[57:56] the promise god of this evil ain't
[58:02] confused of what promise she was
[58:09] confused on the basis of what God said
[58:13] multiply and replenish was not that what
[58:18] the beast explained to her as he was
[58:21] made far are you in me
[58:25] he explained that's what she would fight
[58:28] for you know what that's what she's
[58:33] might
[58:34] but according to brother branham she
[58:38] didn't wait what would have finally
[58:43] become a mother by the will of God to a
[58:47] spoken word okay she didn't you and I
[58:54] would have come forth I did not been
[59:00] aforesaid we know that was a fall that's
[59:03] your philosophy sir okay look at the
[59:07] next one let's go to number nine spoke
[59:15] words of reading those seat Ronna Christ
[59:17] was the top of the second Adams bride
[59:20] bride of Adam was the top of the second
[59:23] Adams bride I'm it's a bride Paul Adams
[59:26] bride could not wait God had told Adam
[59:32] and Eve multiply and replenish the earth
[59:38] it was an oncoming thing a promise you
[59:44] said you're just preaching over what you
[59:45] preach twinsies exactly and I'll do it
[59:47] this coming Wednesday if it takes it no
[59:52] problems just facts
[59:58] where were they gonna multiply and
[1:00:00] replenish what were they to be we've
[1:00:04] been through that we've covered that
[1:00:08] that were to bring forth the human race
[1:00:11] through the spoken word of the mankind
[1:00:14] that would have been the Genesis people
[1:00:20] but by the fall in the way that it came
[1:00:23] we are under the same thing the Bride of
[1:00:27] Christ is to multiply and replenish the
[1:00:30] earth not physically but by that's one
[1:00:36] seed which is Christ
[1:00:43] still got the same promise still in the
[1:00:46] same promise was he listening Wednesday
[1:00:53] what Adams bride could not wait God had
[1:00:58] told Adam and Eve multiply and replenish
[1:01:00] their it was an oncoming thing I promise
[1:01:05] she was not his wife as yet because

[1:01:23] one quote brother round talks about the
[1:01:25] promise what was the promise I kept
[1:01:28] asking the problem what was the promise
[1:01:30] the promise was that he was that they
[1:01:32] was gonna multiply and replenish the air
[1:01:37] would cien entered the picture they
[1:01:39] couldn't do it anyway
[1:01:41] it he's not told them physically
[1:01:43] dropping now to do it come on he's only
[1:01:47] told them in the spiritual but it's told
[1:01:52] Noah after the flood
[1:01:57] come on read your Bible I'll give it to
[1:02:00] you the other day he's in Genesis
[1:02:01] knowing the flood read it he's told Noah
[1:02:04] now multiply and replenish the earth
[1:02:07] physically and brother branham may I
[1:02:09] state him remember what he said he said
[1:02:13] then what reproduced the earth in Noah
[1:02:17] he said to see to the serpent
[1:02:24] it was the physical
[1:02:26] reproduction lissa going on the father's
[1:02:30] spoken words reading those seed number
[1:02:33] 10
[1:02:37] if Eve would have have brought forth
[1:02:41] that child right warned of water-borne
[1:02:46] to the spirit and John the spoken word
[1:02:48] again will pull it back down cuz that's
[1:02:50] a beautiful statement Lord back down
[1:02:53] where we can read the top part Oh
[1:02:56] remember what y'all do with it I don't
[1:02:58] know what you worked all of God's sons
[1:03:01] must be the same yes sir to be born of
[1:03:04] the word of spirit I love that one we're
[1:03:07] gonna get that statement over and over
[1:03:09] and over when we get in bring it in the
[1:03:11] kingdom of God go listen you'll be bored
[1:03:14] of the word the Spirit brings us back to
[1:03:15] the spoken word again like in John 3 to
[1:03:24] be born to the water to spirit what does
[1:03:25] it do then it brings you right back
[1:03:27] again unto the place where you should
[1:03:31] have been at the beginning that's
[1:03:35] wonderful see that's the reason to
[1:03:39] Christ death to bring us right back
[1:03:42] again to were sons of God if he would
[1:03:47] have have brought forth that child she
[1:03:51] would have finally done it did not God
[1:03:56] tell her multiply and replenish there
[1:04:02] but I don't believe that classy there's
[1:04:05] your unbelief we're reading where's your
[1:04:12] unbelief what's the next one where to
[1:04:16] number 11 still out of spoken words a
[1:04:21] regional seat they notice what happened
[1:04:23] in these children the first one that was
[1:04:26] born now God said multiply to his bride
[1:04:29] patterns bright and replenished multiply
[1:04:32] and replenish the earth that was God's
[1:04:34] commission there's the promise and she
[1:04:39] would have done it and he would mixing
[1:04:45] themselves together you see what he's
[1:04:47] saying
[1:04:47] well what happened when Adam got ready
[1:04:50] to come to his bride
[1:04:51] were already a mother God commissioned
[1:04:56] Adam and Eve to multiply and replenish
[1:04:59] the earth they would have brought it by
[1:05:04] as we just read another spoken word no
[1:05:10] problems right listen come on when God
[1:05:23] give a commission which cannot perish
[1:05:29] God's Word is eternal it cannot fail
[1:05:33] he said multiply and replenish the earth
[1:05:35] that was God's eternal purpose now
[1:05:38] listen to carry that out you cannot die
[1:05:43] because it's his word you have to live
[1:05:48] if that child been brought forth right
[1:05:53] there have been no death but she
[1:05:57] couldn't wait what was the promise Adam
[1:06:04] and Eve multiply replenish the earth
[1:06:08] bring forth the Christ but you don't
[1:06:12] need to Christ leanness see that's
[1:06:14] quicks mine there he goes your mind it's
[1:06:16] done gone and you didn't took Satan's
[1:06:18] idea we don't we'll need craft I would
[1:06:28] back up and follow you he might argue
[1:06:32] about the flesh of Jesus but remember
[1:06:36] Christ was the child then Adam and Eve
[1:06:39] was to bring I won't Christ don't you so
[1:06:43] you see how easy it is to be in doubt
[1:06:48] the same as Eve the Christ child there'd
[1:06:55] be no problem with the Christ child
[1:06:56] coming without sin
[1:07:01] there's no problem with the flash coming
[1:07:03] without seeing you know fan even though
[1:07:08] saying I went at a proper no crime yeah
[1:07:10] we don't need it see the arsy
[1:07:11] keep clicking buttons up right in that
[1:07:14] brain you know what we don't need it you
[1:07:18] don't want it you realize what I'm
[1:07:25] saying
[1:07:26] had they been no fall and there'd been
[1:07:28] no situation would we still wanted to
[1:07:32] just look up and and see God as father
[1:07:36] and time would you not want him to come
[1:07:40] down and dwell among you in flesh with
[1:07:43] you if you were in flesh you seaters we
[1:07:52] think we got it all figured out yeah and
[1:08:00] what was the rest that we kept talking
[1:08:01] about the only reason our only
[1:08:06] difference in the way he was made than
[1:08:09] any other of the other animal kingdom
[1:08:14] she was made to be a mother so whatever
[1:08:17] animal made to be a mother
[1:08:18] the only difference now forgive me for
[1:08:22] being blunt the only difference was in
[1:08:25] the animal kingdom it was only far and
[1:08:28] I'm quoting brother branham reproduction
[1:08:34] it would only been once a year or
[1:08:36] whatever for the puppies the woman
[1:08:42] wouldn't made that way you can call that
[1:08:46] a defect I don't I called it her
[1:08:49] god-given right to keep that free moral
[1:08:54] agency and stay with God's Word and not
[1:09:00] take Satan's lie to try to figure it out
[1:09:03] and to wait for God well you think we've
[1:09:06] been here 50 years waiting on God
[1:09:16] he said well he been ready oh so was it
[1:09:21] was Moses okay
[1:09:25] Moses got ready went down to Egypt he
[1:09:28] didn't work out too good he went back to
[1:09:30] the wilderness and stayed 40 years
[1:09:33] the waiting's on the people not waiting
[1:09:36] on God waiting on you and I to get out
[1:09:41] of our stupidity in human elements and
[1:09:46] to believe what God says without trying
[1:09:52] to reason it out just give me just a
[1:10:00] minute
[1:10:03] you realized then man has been put on a
[1:10:09] set wheel you can pull it up if you want
[1:10:11] to number 14 go jump over man's been put
[1:10:17] on a set wheel according to revelations
[1:10:19] chapter 4
[1:10:20] why will you call that set wheel let her
[1:10:24] random because it puts a man and a woman
[1:10:27] back again like Adam and Eve at the
[1:10:32] Garden of Eden yeah we don't want no set
[1:10:37] wheel what I said well go oh no we ain't
[1:10:42] got self well we he chose me did you
[1:10:50] choose you over yourself we'll all right
[1:10:59] the two trees set wheel this one is
[1:11:02] death this one is life self will the
[1:11:05] moral free moral agency God placed the
[1:11:09] first man Adam and Eve right down on
[1:11:12] free moral agency he places you the same
[1:11:16] place and the only way that you can get
[1:11:19] this thing fixed in here is your own
[1:11:23] self wheel
[1:11:25] hallelujah yourself will you have to
[1:11:30] wheel to do God's will I didn't write
[1:11:34] the book you read it off the page
[1:11:38] you have to get rid of your own wheel
[1:11:43] then let God's will come in for this is
[1:11:47] the only channel that leads to the heart
[1:11:51] and one-seventh leads to the hardest
[1:11:54] that wheel will get to that wind esteem
[1:11:56] okay come on the breech Adam fell to
[1:12:02] death he brought death upon creation he
[1:12:05] was given free moral agency was given to
[1:12:08] them just as we show to make a choice
[1:12:11] now Adam and Eve in the beginning there
[1:12:15] was a tree of right and wrong before
[1:12:17] them and that same tree sets before each
[1:12:20] and every one of us God is doing two for
[1:12:25] Adam and er4 even or would he see not
[1:12:28] changing it he said well he's their
[1:12:30] father no not now it isn't it's your
[1:12:35] fault you can't place you don't have
[1:12:38] them now you've got to place it on
[1:12:40] yourselves because right and wrong is
[1:12:42] set before you you're on the frame basis
[1:12:45] in Adam and Eve sev will free moral
[1:12:51] agency let's write it down I heard
[1:12:56] brother choice oh man he preached serve
[1:12:58] another sermon about that God chose us
[1:13:01] brother Dale's preach sermon after
[1:13:03] sermon about God's using us this is not
[1:13:09] changing it because I never had any idea
[1:13:11] there that he chose me above what you
[1:13:17] have to make a choice choose you this
[1:13:23] day whom you serve
[1:13:29] let's see we've got it all figured out
[1:13:31] with the great revelations he shows us
[1:13:34] we didn't how to do it
[1:13:35] we had eternal life or door Oh ain't
[1:13:36] inglorious we just come down to this
[1:13:38] world and we just we've just had to
[1:13:40] we've done this and we went out into the
[1:13:42] sin oh and we went out into adultery and
[1:13:47] we went out into all of these
[1:13:49] drinking's and yeah yeah where's the
[1:13:52] eternal inside oh that's funny
[1:13:59] come on if you come in the world with
[1:14:01] eternal life then what was the things of
[1:14:05] us doing wrong come on get it off
[1:14:12] what's the things that you're not doing
[1:14:14] wrong if we come into the world with
[1:14:16] eternal life that would put an eternal
[1:14:20] God into a filthy Center and that will
[1:14:23] not work
[1:14:25] that's the worst unbelief that there is
[1:14:27] a priest in about three months ago the
[1:14:31] worst unbelief is what for you to sit
[1:14:34] down and think you're right just because
[1:14:38] of your thinking that's the worst thing
[1:14:43] anybody could ever have free moral
[1:14:47] agency go ahead and number 15 what a
[1:14:57] wheel did we read that it says okay no
[1:15:01] 16 go into 16 a paradox you're on the
[1:15:05] same basis as Adam and Eve was if God
[1:15:09] puts you on anything else it would be
[1:15:14] unjust to Adam and Eve that solve it
[1:15:20] each Adam and Eve tonight has gotten to
[1:15:23] right and wrong sitting before him you
[1:15:26] can make your choice you can take God's
[1:15:29] Word or leave God's Word you can take
[1:15:32] God's Word or your denomination or
[1:15:34] Creed's about it you can take your
[1:15:37] modernistic ideas of what it is you can
[1:15:40] be born
[1:15:40] again and filled with the Holy Ghost or
[1:15:42] you can be Church eyes that's a good
[1:15:44] word either one you won't to church eyes
[1:15:48] I never heard that one it's a new word
[1:15:50] that's not in webstore don't get
[1:15:53] seventeen the power of transformation
[1:16:01] wonder number seventeen we gotta hold up
[1:16:09] someone this he just let him out there
[1:16:15] on free moral agency to let him act he
[1:16:20] couldn't make them do it and still be
[1:16:24] just me somewhat Adam and Eve right he's
[1:16:26] how much you and me but he's telling
[1:16:28] that Adam and Eve he just put him out
[1:16:31] there on the free moral agency look now
[1:16:37] you want to read something he just let
[1:16:41] him out their own free moral agency to
[1:16:44] let them act he couldn't make them do it
[1:16:47] and still be just but he could put them
[1:16:52] equal with him oh what's he mean equal
[1:17:04] with him Adam and Eve wouldn't equal
[1:17:07] with God God was the god of glory they
[1:17:10] would be the god of the earth even
[1:17:11] they're ruling the human person you and
[1:17:14] I are not equals with God on the basis
[1:17:17] of being that way it's guarding us that
[1:17:19] makes us what we are but you don't want
[1:17:24] God had a choice he had a free moral
[1:17:32] agency we have a free moral agency read
[1:17:36] it he could put them equal with him so
[1:17:43] thereby we know who they were created
[1:17:44] perfect nothing wrong look and free
[1:17:48] moral agency and then let them do it
[1:17:51] themselves
[1:17:53] and he knew they would do it so then you
[1:17:59] see then when Adams live with she
[1:18:04] brought four twins and one of them was
[1:18:07] of Satan the other one of them was of
[1:18:09] Adam which was of God Cain and Abel gave
[1:18:15] them a free moral agency let's get one
[1:18:21] more 18
[1:18:27] God's gift always find their place
[1:18:29] that's the reason that God does nothing
[1:18:32] outside of a man he always works through
[1:18:34] a man because he had to use a man a man
[1:18:37] is what he had to use to display his
[1:18:39] attribute a savior he had to make him in
[1:18:42] His image and make him something like
[1:18:45] him and put him on free moral agency and
[1:18:48] let him act any way he wanted to he
[1:18:52] could take his choice and he knew that
[1:18:55] man by giving him this choice would fall
[1:19:03] so being that he had to do he had to do
[1:19:08] that he turns back around and makes the
[1:19:11] man a partner to him and does nothing
[1:19:14] except he does it through a man the
[1:19:18] whole work of redemption come by man
[1:19:20] hallelujah death come by the first man
[1:19:23] life come by the second man see there
[1:19:25] you are
[1:19:25] he does nothing because he had to use a
[1:19:27] man for that then he uses a man redeemed
[1:19:31] by Christ had to come into being a man a
[1:19:37] mortal man the ability in flesh to die
[1:19:46] in flesh to die to pay the price but are
[1:19:51] you listening what was the promise God
[1:19:56] made it Eve dat it multiply and
[1:20:01] replenish the earth
[1:20:03] which was a spoken word being original
[1:20:06] word of God had she brought it forth
[1:20:09] correctly who would have come out right
[1:20:11] but giving them free moral agency
[1:20:13] brother Brennan said he knew they would
[1:20:15] fall but does that mean he made them
[1:20:18] fall no because there's for your problem
[1:20:22] I said it a minute ago you still got it
[1:20:24] in your mind choice deals with two
[1:20:26] things you can choose God and live or
[1:20:32] Satan and die the choice is yours
[1:20:38] you have no choice Allah word eternal
[1:20:42] you got a choice to believe that I have
[1:20:47] a choice not to believe it in the way
[1:20:50] you're trying to express it choose you
[1:20:55] this day whom you serve for me in my
[1:20:59] house will just keep right on going just
[1:21:05] keep right on going fifty years hasn't
[1:21:09] been no problem I'm 77 I don't want 50
[1:21:11] more that would kind of running things
[1:21:13] out a lot no we don't want to go that
[1:21:15] way but I ain't gonna argue with him I
[1:21:19] didn't want it to come this far when I
[1:21:22] said it but I stood in this pulpit and
[1:21:24] said it in 74 that we could go to 2026
[1:21:28] nobody wants to know why I said dad we
[1:21:33] get everybody else has got their
[1:21:34] predictions of this and it was supposed
[1:21:36] to be 77 it was supposed to be 73 and a
[1:21:38] high of his both the 80s as opposed to
[1:21:40] me I said it because of a promise who
[1:21:46] was in God's Word
[1:21:47] that I'll not leave you comfortless I'll
[1:21:54] come to you the bride is to prove to
[1:21:59] Satan she's going to be tried I was
[1:22:03] worried reading it go to this evil age
[1:22:07] we're even
[1:22:07] she's to prove to Satan that she won't
[1:22:10] fall
[1:22:15] what if he gives us another fifty year
[1:22:17] again but you see when you make
[1:22:25] statements outlandish things people
[1:22:27] don't remember and they don't want to
[1:22:29] I had no references and whatsoever of D
[1:22:35] Christianizing anybody in any form I
[1:22:38] told what God told me I said the biggest
[1:22:43] portion of people of this message will
[1:22:45] die and go by the grave because they
[1:22:50] won't be able to take the change now I
[1:22:54] said that 40 years ago no references to
[1:23:00] nobody god I may be the next one time
[1:23:05] runs on I will be one of them that will
[1:23:08] go to the grave i had no references to
[1:23:14] their christianity because you see the
[1:23:17] reference i had when you reach your
[1:23:21] position listen real careful when you
[1:23:25] reach your position in Christ
[1:23:27] why is they some here this 90 and some
[1:23:30] were forties or fifties you know when
[1:23:32] you reach the place in Christ the day
[1:23:35] Martin Luther preached the message that
[1:23:38] just shall live by faith his destiny was
[1:23:41] set to go to the grave because there
[1:23:45] would be no change preached during that
[1:23:47] age
[1:23:48] It didn t Christianized him did it
[1:23:51] it said him the way God wanted him he
[1:23:53] brought a message that we still believe
[1:23:55] today not decreasing isin nobody today
[1:24:03] may be a way ahead of us waiting on us
[1:24:07] to catch up to where they are yet people
[1:24:12] that want that they get the feelings
[1:24:14] hurt me thank you throwing off on
[1:24:15] somebody what if I'm the next one get
[1:24:18] right up behind the pulpit waiter who
[1:24:20] does a funeral get a better sight well

[1:24:25] that's gone home so he's waiting on us
[1:24:30] no let's tan
[1:24:32] come on musician free moral agency which
[1:24:38] is a right to choose and God will not
[1:24:42] override your free moral agency he ain't
[1:24:48] gonna make you saved and you don't want
[1:24:50] to be saved it gives us a choice and
[1:25:00] that choice lays before everyone of us I
[1:25:05] hope he caught what it's all about the
[1:25:07] promise
[1:25:08] I tried wins too but it didn't work the
[1:25:11] promise Eve would have finally brought
[1:25:16] that child we don't want to believe that
[1:25:23] what we all becaus who says that but he
[1:25:29] calls you out some idea this contrary to
[1:25:34] that right thought could that be our
[1:25:38] unbelief well we got breath okay you

[1:27:05] coming up highway I said son I said my
[1:27:13] horse is not in the resurrection of the
[1:27:17] Prophet I said my hopes is not in the
[1:27:22] resurrection I said listen to me
[1:27:24] it's not in the resurrection of Jesus
[1:27:26] Christ that's already been done
[1:27:36] 2,000 years ago he readies are you
[1:27:39] trying to make him rise again I said my
[1:27:42] hope is not in the resurrection of Jesus
[1:27:44] Christ back down we've preached at 2,000
[1:27:47] years of that resurrection but I thought
[1:27:50] your prophet said your resurrection lays
[1:27:55] inside of you in your spirit so where's
[1:27:59] my hope that in the resurrection the day
[1:28:02] of Jesus Christ that come from back
[1:28:05] there
[1:28:05] to give me a new birth here to let me
[1:28:09] rest in him now you misunderstand what I
[1:28:11] said on that and you'll think I'm
[1:28:14] throwing slangs in the mud

[1:28:21] back
[1:28:22] I look forward
[1:28:27] I've been there walked in the place
[1:28:31] stood down prayed in the tomb that is
[1:28:36] empty my hopes he's not building that
[1:28:41] part because that's what's already
[1:28:43] happened my hopes is building whether or
[1:28:46] not Christ is living within me now
[1:28:49] because a God of yesterday is no good
[1:28:54] [Music]
[1:28:56] doesn't mean that's what's wrong while
[1:28:58] we've been here 50 years it's God's
[1:29:01] waiting on somebody to say it and say
[1:29:05] we're here in its present tense and a
[1:29:07] reality of crises in our hearts that's
[1:29:10] all I've ever preached is the
[1:29:13] resurrection of Jesus Christ coming from
[1:29:15] 2,000 years ago and bringing him to a
[1:29:17] reality into our hearts and lives right
[1:29:20] now to see Christ alive that's what it
[1:29:28] is
[1:29:29] why
[1:29:31] [Music]
