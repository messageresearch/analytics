[2:55] the same thing
[2:57] we're not going to wish brother Dell
[2:59] another happy birthday that's okay if we
[3:01] do but tomorrow will be his birthday and
[3:03] he'll be 80 years old tomorrow so god
[3:06] bless him for living such a wonderful
[3:08] long laugh but sunday will service will
[3:11] start at 10 o'clock but as we were
[3:12] discussing now this friend he's going to
[3:14] be different because we're going to have
[3:16] two services so the second service will
[3:18] be just our normal what we have and I
[3:21] don't mean to exclude I say we the
[3:23] people that come every Sunday never wins
[3:26] didn't some musicians the deacons the
[3:28] ministers and some of the different
[3:29] lassie that comes
[3:31] that we're going to have second service
[3:34] will start at one o'clock so if you come
[3:35] Sunday morning that's okay we're still
[3:38] gonna do you know we'll be
[3:39] live-streaming Sunday afternoon if you
[3:40] want to go home that's fine if you want
[3:42] to stay you have to make arrangements to
[3:44] get you something to eat and eat in the
[3:45] car because you can't come in here and
[3:47] eat to keep our social distancing at a
[3:50] minimum so if you want to come please do
[3:54] for those of you that are coming Sunday
[3:57] school start at 9:30 just like we always
[3:59] do but regular services start at 10:00
[4:01] and then brother Dale will speak and
[4:03] then we'll have a break and then one
[4:05] o'clock one house that service so if
[4:08] you'd like to come we wish you would
[4:11] make sure you stay in your car though do
[4:14] not get outside and mingle between cars
[4:16] so as we don't cause any problems we
[4:19] don't want to any problems we've let
[4:21] this open a little bit I hear the
[4:24] government's doing that too so let's
[4:26] just pray for our leaders that
[4:29] you know it's it's kind of strange that
[4:32] you become human until you're a
[4:34] politician so you know and then they
[4:37] have to do everything perfect so they're
[4:39] there all over our government but I I
[4:41] just wanted I wanted to if I was trumped
[4:45] what I would do is is I would call one
[4:47] of them people that are bashing him from
[4:50] seeing in and all them different fate
[4:52] news networks I would say come up here
[4:54] and you stand behind this podium and you
[4:56] tell me what you can do better than I'm
[4:58] doing if you're gonna criticize me come
[5:01] up here if you got a better way I'll
[5:02] hear it but say they won't do that no
[5:04] they won't do that but just pray for our
[5:06] leaders the Bible tells us to do that
[5:08] told us to pray for those who have
[5:10] authority over so he's doing the best he
[5:13] can they're the group he's got us doing
[5:15] the best they can but we know one that's
[5:18] perfect and that's God Almighty and we
[5:21] understand too that all things happen
[5:23] for our good nothing happens to harm a
[5:27] Christian right so and then all that
[5:30] there is going to be weapons formed
[5:32] against us but he's already raised up a
[5:35] standard God didn't did this surprise
[5:38] him the other day when all this happened
[5:40] he knew exactly this was right in what
[5:41] he foresaw and the plan he foresaw and
[5:44] he knew whether you would pray are you
[5:46] where you wouldn't pray same way we need
[5:49] to pray for brother Joel Forney laying
[5:51] up there in the hospital and Charlotte
[5:52] he was life flighted in the helicopter
[5:55] because he had bleeding on his brain he
[5:57] had a blood clot there in his right side
[6:00] of his brain that thorny half stroke and
[6:01] they're waiting for him to wake up we're
[6:02] just gonna pray that God will
[6:04] supernaturally move on the same they
[6:07] bought man's already done what man can
[6:09] do man's done what man can do they went
[6:12] in they've operated they've done the
[6:13] best they could now we're we're gonna
[6:15] ask God to do something supernatural
[6:17] bring him out of that because we need
[6:19] him and he has a group of people now
[6:21] that needs him there in North Carolina
[6:24] and we pray for them also so god bless
[6:26] you let's turn our Bibles to
[6:28] galatians 3 we're going to continue on
[6:32] with this journey of believer part seven
[6:35] we're going to get into we know that as
[6:39] Sunday what we're going to do is is move
[6:41] over into another chapter in Ruth and
[6:45] see how another person made her way
[6:47] through a journey
[6:50] that is a parallel to what our Christian
[6:53] journey is just like Abraham but
[6:55] remember there was four parts to her
[6:57] journey
[7:00] okay deciding whatever it was resting I
[7:04] read it and then reward it we got to get
[7:05] the reward part is the adoption brother
[7:08] branham talks about it's good to be born
[7:11] again it's good to go through the three
[7:12] stages of grace and get to the
[7:13] circumcision but tonight we're going to
[7:15] get to where Abraham comes to a place
[7:18] where he meets God in human flesh and he
[7:21] gets a promise from God that promise
[7:23] comes to pass and then God tells him to
[7:26] take him out and kill him
[7:28] take him out and kill him I'll give you
[7:30] the promise son now will you do what I
[7:33] ask you to do okay so we'll read it
[7:35] through the scripture and we will take a
[7:38] little snippets out and move on as we
[7:41] can also I just want to tell you that
[7:43] all of y'all they got your stimulus
[7:45] package
[7:46] pay your tithe
[7:49] that is game pay your tithes on that
[7:53] money brothers and sisters that's just
[7:55] you should already know now but
[7:57] sometimes you get things and you go man
[7:59] this is great oh well I need to pay
[8:01] tithe on that cuz this game so
[8:05] and even Trump told you to do it
[8:09] he said don't forget your spiritual
[8:11] leaders don't forget your church that
[8:12] you attend and it's important I don't
[8:15] see where where that
[8:18] the world needs some form of religion
[8:22] whether it be whatever it is and and I
[8:25] was thinking today I thought well
[8:27] we as the bride we we're we're you know
[8:30] millions maybe across the world but
[8:33] there's gonna be untold billions of
[8:35] people in that new city I mean can go in
[8:40] and out of the new city we're only ones
[8:41] that can but the world itself will be
[8:44] populated by all these people in the Old
[8:46] Testament they died under the faith that
[8:48] God is little babies all the little
[8:50] babies that died all the little babies
[8:52] just died right on up to we've got 7
[8:54] billion people in the world now that's
[8:56] probably not gonna be but a million
[8:57] people make a rapture just say well
[9:00] that's six point nine nine billion
[9:02] people that God is gonna have to deal
[9:05] with and he will and he knows he's
[9:07] actually the dimensions of the earth and
[9:08] everything it needs well you know what
[9:09] we need but I was thinking though
[9:11] they're going to populate they're gonna
[9:13] be important
[9:14] they're important people there's
[9:17] somebody for us to congregate with and
[9:19] for us to talk about and talk to and
[9:22] listen to their experience as they come
[9:26] through the world and and I thank God
[9:27] that we know we're brother dick yes
[9:31] we can rest assured that will not heal
[9:33] not have to grown to get up out of that
[9:35] to get up out of that seat right there
[9:37] anymore he won't have to check his sugar
[9:41] anymore he won't have to worry about
[9:44] things anymore he's in a place of bliss
[9:47] and happiness
[9:49] that you and I will only attain to if
[9:51] we're born again my brother Dale was
[9:54] talking about Sunday you must be born
[9:57] again the resurrection you are not
[9:59] included in the first resurrection if
[10:01] you're not born again
[10:03] amen it has no you know ii remember the
[10:08] second death and all the second you
[10:09] don't want to see that second
[10:10] resurrection no you want to be in that
[10:13] first resurrection or be those that are
[10:15] alive and remain so god bless you let's
[10:18] read Galatians 3:16 but let's go to the
[10:20] Lord in prayer
[10:21] before we get started thank you Lord for
[10:24] having us a good day today Lord
[10:27] but now we remember in the forefront of
[10:29] our mind our brother Joel Forney Lord
[10:31] not just the Galant brother not just a
[10:34] soldier in arms he's a good friend
[10:38] and lord I pray that you would send the
[10:41] healing angels to that room Lord we know
[10:44] right now there's probably thousands of
[10:46] people lifting up prayers for that
[10:48] gallant man that has used the biggest
[10:53] part of his middle and toward the 50
[10:56] year old that he's been traveling around
[10:58] this world and no telling how many
[11:00] people
[11:01] have been blessed by his ministry and
[11:03] have been healed many people have have
[11:07] got families now that didn't have
[11:08] families because of this man speaking
[11:10] the Word of God we pray that you would
[11:13] touch him father also touch sister
[11:15] Vanessa and the girls and the boys Lord
[11:18] we pray that you just be with them give
[11:21] them comfort in this time of need Lord I
[11:23] believe Lord then you've never left that
[11:27] part of healing that you'll always be
[11:30] that until we get into that new home
[11:32] Lord you'll always be a healer you set
[11:35] it in motion a long time ago I am the
[11:38] Lord who healeth all thy diseases so
[11:41] father we pray that you would do that be
[11:43] with each one Lord take care of us on
[11:44] our walk of life this thing that's come
[11:47] upon the world Lord this virus Lord we
[11:51] knew they was things coming but I
[11:52] believe this is probably not the worst
[11:54] of it because there's some really bad
[11:56] things in Revelations that we don't even
[11:58] want to talk about that we're not going
[12:00] to see because we're going to Lord we're
[12:03] gonna continue as Abraham we're gonna
[12:04] walk walk walk walk walk right into a
[12:07] body change Lord I prayed this you just
[12:09] be with the ones that are not here Lord
[12:11] the ones that are here the ones that are
[12:13] sick the ones this lost loved ones
[12:14] brother Dick's family Lord give them
[12:17] comfort brother Al's family give them
[12:18] comfort the loss of this mother their
[12:20] Lord we pray this you just bind us
[12:22] together Lord in one unity as
[12:26] husband and wife of a great bride and a
[12:30] great bridegroom in us in town probably
[12:32] give us this day our daily bread and
[12:33] forgive us of our sins in Jesus name
[12:35] Amen
[12:36] collations 3:16 says now to Abraham and
[12:39] his seed were the promises made now that
[12:41] was a promise made he saith not and to
[12:43] seeds as of many but as of one not the
[12:46] full seed that was
[12:48] and let me bring us out just for a
[12:51] second because you know brother Dick was
[12:54] a seed of Abraham but that old person
[12:57] that sat there and that that expired a
[13:00] few days ago that wasn't the seed of
[13:02] Abraham that was the seed of mom and
[13:04] daddy that got him here so that he can
[13:07] declare the seed of Abraham that was
[13:10] inside of him and that city that Abraham
[13:13] was looking for what inside of him but
[13:15] brother dick and each one of us have
[13:17] their own have that city inside of us
[13:20] tonight amen so brother didn't knew that
[13:23] and you know why because he went right
[13:24] to that when he when he passed from here
[13:26] to there he left though the seed of mom
[13:28] and Daddy here what the seed produced
[13:31] the flesh and he took that seed of
[13:34] Abraham that face seed held on but as of
[13:37] one and to thy seed which is Christ and
[13:39] he just walked right over into where
[13:41] what all the other seeds of Abraham are
[13:43] amen what a joy I mean we missed by the
[13:48] day but what a joy that you can we can
[13:51] see that and know that it's a surety
[13:53] that that's what's going to happen and
[13:54] that a man of called Abraham walked on
[13:57] this earth physically just to show us
[13:59] what we're doing in this in time and
[14:01] this I say that's a covenant that was
[14:02] confirmed before God in Christ the law
[14:05] which was 430 years after cannot dis and
[14:07] all that it should make the promise of
[14:09] none effect in other words God put the
[14:12] law in he put it in effect to a certain
[14:14] degree but he did not dissing old that
[14:17] Covenant he made with Abraham it can't
[14:20] do away with that ma'am and though you
[14:23] got to be an Abraham to receive it he
[14:27] didn't give it a lot he gave it to
[14:29] Abraham
[14:30] for if the inheritance be of the law it
[14:34] is no more promise in other words if you
[14:35] do the Ten Commandments what did what
[14:38] did the rich young ruler said he said
[14:39] I've done them all
[14:41] but he found out he wasn't a seed of
[14:43] Abraham because you didn't give up at
[14:45] one thing and follow Christ but every
[14:49] seed of Abraham will follow Christ
[14:50] because it is the seed of Christ pretty
[14:53] simple for the inherence for if the
[14:55] inheritance be of the law it is no more
[14:57] promise but God gave it to Abraham by
[15:00] promise Hebrews 6 verse 13 from when God
[15:03] made promise to Abraham because he could
[15:05] swear my know by no greater he swore by
[15:07] himself saying surely blessing I will
[15:09] bless them multiplying I will multiply
[15:11] them and so after that he had patiently
[15:14] endured they gave him the promise at
[15:16] first but Abram had to become Abraham
[15:20] and had to walk 25 years and then after
[15:23] that 25 years he had to wait till that
[15:24] kid got 9 or 10 years old and then still
[15:27] was testing him being the seed of
[15:30] Abraham by promise so after he had
[15:33] patiently endured he obtained the
[15:35] promise you may be seated the Lord had
[15:38] his blessing to the reading of the word
[15:39] let's read this one quoting hood this
[15:41] milk as that we read it before but I
[15:42] want to read it more to get us to know
[15:45] that in this end time
[15:50] we have had this word home to an edge so
[15:56] there's no variation of saying well we
[15:58] might be or this might be the right way
[16:01] or this might be the right quote or this
[16:05] might be the right Bible know if you're
[16:08] guessing at that you need to be born
[16:10] again because when you get born again it
[16:13] will turn your sight right to the true
[16:16] true
[16:18] Bible and the prophets message and they
[16:22] dovetail so they can't be any different
[16:25] one from the other so this this man we
[16:27] call William Branham the prophet in the
[16:29] end time this is what he says about us
[16:31] when Abraham met him he was Melchizedek
[16:33] he unfolds here what all the attributes
[16:35] are doing the final end though you and I
[16:37] are attributes and this is the final in
[16:39] starts talking about us all right every
[16:42] son of Abraham every son of the faith
[16:44] will absolutely do the same things like
[16:48] I said before if you if you can't in
[16:51] some way put your Christian journey
[16:54] inside of what we've been talking about
[16:56] then I prop I begged you to
[17:00] start in Genesis chapter 12 and open
[17:05] your heart up and let God call you and
[17:06] you respond to what God said because God
[17:10] said then I'll make up the a great
[17:12] nation I'll bless thee I'll bless them
[17:16] that bless thee curse them to curse thee
[17:18] I'm gonna take you a land that I will
[17:21] show thee we understand now that that
[17:24] sure we have to connect to it because it
[17:27] doesn't make the promise
[17:29] somebody's gonna be the seed of Abraham
[17:32] amen you just gotta determine by your
[17:35] free moral agency if you want to be a
[17:38] part of that or not because that's what
[17:40] Abram ID and I just believe this I have
[17:42] no quote I have no I have no angel or
[17:45] light come into the room but I do have
[17:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe
[17:49] so it ought to be able to tell us that
[17:51] God may have spoke to many people during
[17:53] Abraham's time and they did not respond
[17:56] just because it can't be any different
[17:57] than now
[17:59] no one will go to the white throne
[18:01] judgment I don't believe no one will go
[18:04] to the white throne judgment and say God
[18:06] you never spoke to me because see he
[18:08] would he can't do that he can't be a
[18:10] just God unless he takes you to the very
[18:13] day and says I called you on this day
[18:17] and you did not respond then I called
[18:20] you on this day and you did not respond
[18:22] and I finally called you on this day
[18:24] right here and you never responded amen
[18:27] but the promise of Abraham was somebody
[18:30] said I'll go that's what Abraham said
[18:33] I'll go I'll go in that same way with
[18:36] Mary Mayer said being unto me according
[18:39] to thy word
[18:42] you say brother that's too simple that's
[18:44] just the way God is
[18:45] that's being a free moral agent yes and
[18:48] no two simple words but very powerful
[18:51] and Abram gets up and he walks with God
[18:54] and he accepts what God says and he just
[18:57] keeps walking into different journeys of
[18:58] his life and we're not gonna pull it up
[19:01] but we went through justification and we
[19:03] saw that justification in Genesis 12
[19:06] Genesis 13 the Bible tells us in the
[19:09] book of Romans I'm just gonna fly
[19:10] through these real quick to get to this
[19:12] last point because we've had had them
[19:14] before Romans 3 verse 24 says being
[19:17] justified freely by His grace through
[19:19] the redemption that is in Christ Jesus
[19:21] now Abram
[19:22] Abram trusted what a man said he trusted
[19:26] what a man said get up and walk you have
[19:31] to trust in yourself that the justifier
[19:35] can justify you
[19:38] listen if you don't believe God can
[19:40] forgive you of your past sins you're
[19:43] lost I
[19:45] have to believe just as much listen to
[19:48] me I have to believe just as much for
[19:50] justification as I did for
[19:52] sanctification and
[19:54] as I did for the baptism of the Holy
[19:55] Ghost
[19:57] because if you don't start out in
[19:59] justification and get your past sins
[20:02] chopped off they just they just like
[20:04] Abram
[20:07] all these past has the idol worshiper
[20:10] and I have the idol maker not that was
[20:12] all gone but what do you do he grabbed a
[20:14] hold of a lot
[20:15] he grabbed a hold of a lot and took lot
[20:18] with him same way with you and I we take
[20:20] some things with us we're already been
[20:21] through this before but the problem is a
[20:24] lot of times we justify herself
[20:27] you see many times in people's life
[20:30] that they try to justify what they did I
[20:35] can't and will not justify what I did I
[20:39] did him I was there
[20:43] hey man you did them you were there and
[20:47] the devil reminds you of them every once
[20:50] in a while once in the morning in awhile
[20:52] in the afternoon yeah mm-hmm me too but
[20:55] you know what that cannot be God if
[20:58] you're truly justifying
[21:00] he never he never looked at Abram when
[21:05] he got to Sarah and Hagar and that
[21:08] little deal they made which was
[21:09] permissive will not perfect well he
[21:12] never said now Abram I promised you way
[21:14] back yonder
[21:17] now I know you were in our work God's
[21:19] never seen what I I love that about God
[21:22] he's never gonna bring up your past
[21:24] cuz he don't remember it oh oh man he
[21:28] just doesn't remember it so he's not
[21:31] gonna bring it back you know what he's
[21:33] gonna bring back he's gonna say don't
[21:35] you remember that night I called you
[21:39] don't you remember that night I called
[21:41] you and you responded and you got up and
[21:45] walked with me
[21:47] you was a free moral agent
[21:52] because remember as brother Brahim tells
[21:55] us Jesus Christ came and died for
[21:57] everybody that would accept him but he
[22:00] knew who would accept him and who would
[22:02] not and man so he can let somebody
[22:04] that's why I've always on predestination
[22:07] you
[22:08] Adolf Hitler are people like that their
[22:11] heart I use him for the horribleness of
[22:13] it but God knew that if he let laid off
[22:16] Hitler live a million years he could
[22:18] come to Adolf Hitler every day
[22:20] enable and they in Adolf Hitler's life
[22:23] and say you know Hitler I am God
[22:26] walk with me he knows by foreknowledge
[22:30] and predestination especially by
[22:32] foreknowledge first that he would not
[22:34] ever do it give him a million years and
[22:36] he'd never do it so therefore he could
[22:38] take him whenever he wanted to
[22:40] because he knew that
[22:42] same way with you and I though
[22:45] he knew that
[22:47] you didn't doing the things you did the
[22:51] things I did the things birth boy did
[22:53] all the different ones you're not alone
[22:56] we all got a past God don't know it but
[23:00] we still do but he comes to a time and
[23:02] he says hey man come walk with me just
[23:05] just move away from that just a little
[23:07] bit come with to me all ye that are
[23:11] heavy laden and I'll give you rest now
[23:15] see that's where you gotta start having
[23:17] faith like a Brahma even had where Abram
[23:20] said ok God
[23:22] if I'm gonna be a father in many nations
[23:24] I got no kids with even Sarah I'm still
[23:29] Abram and I'm still walking around in
[23:30] Egypt and I'm going to Canaan and I'm
[23:32] going to live and I'm making mistakes
[23:34] over here and over there he says I don't
[23:36] worry about that I'm not worried about
[23:38] that he knows the end from the beginning
[23:43] you and I just have to do what I believe
[23:46] Abram just yielded itself to that voice
[23:48] and that voice led him through all the
[23:53] different stages same way with you and I
[23:54] on justification don't try to justify
[23:57] yourself
[23:58] let God justify you and when he does it
[24:01] is a finished work for those who he has
[24:04] justified he has already
[24:07] glorified so if he if he brings you to a
[24:10] place just like we're gonna read in a
[24:12] few minutes Abraham
[24:14] God knew we're gonna read in chapter
[24:17] about eighteen or nineteen that God said
[24:20] I know Abraham is going to take this
[24:23] journey and this part that he played in
[24:27] the earth and he's going to tell it to
[24:29] his son and his sons gonna tell it to
[24:32] his son and his sons gonna tell it to
[24:34] his son and his sons gonna tell it to
[24:36] his son all down through the generations
[24:38] God knew Abraham was going to speak of
[24:41] this man that met him in his life and
[24:44] now what you and I do when you become a
[24:46] Christian you want to tell you want to
[24:48] tell how I met this man who did you meet
[24:51] ho let me tell you about him well have
[24:54] you seen him no I hadn't physically seen
[24:56] him but I see maybe where and then when
[24:59] you get a little further in your journey
[25:00] when you become Abraham and you get some
[25:02] yet to be circumcised then you look
[25:04] exactly like and you say there's God in
[25:07] human flesh I have met God in human
[25:09] flesh I haven't met God in human flesh
[25:13] but maybe not in you first part of your
[25:15] journey because Abraham Abram didn't
[25:17] either but now remember
[25:20] here's a little key that I was thinking
[25:22] about a few minutes ago when Abram
[25:26] over in chapter 14 he goes and delivers
[25:31] lot all right he goes in delivers lot
[25:34] has a battle and who meets him
[25:37] Melchizedek
[25:38] God in human flesh
[25:42] meets him and gives him communion now
[25:45] listen that was such a that was such a
[25:49] life-changing thing for Abram he never
[25:52] forgot that guy's face because I want to
[25:54] tell you something that man that had no
[25:56] father no mother and the lending of days
[25:58] no beginning of life
[25:59] he didn't meet a different person over
[26:02] here when he was Abraham
[26:05] he met the same man
[26:08] same man and put on a little bit of
[26:11] flesh over that theophany and they
[26:14] commune with each other Abram and you
[26:17] and I always will always remember that
[26:20] God that you met in the first part of
[26:24] your journey because sometimes it look
[26:26] like he left and it looks like he did it
[26:28] looks like even in justification all the
[26:30] way to to when he met him in the plains
[26:33] of Mamre you don't see him appear in
[26:35] flashy anymore
[26:36] but he appeared just enough so that
[26:39] Abram could have what and I a
[26:43] singular I to know who that person was
[26:47] and who he'll know him much more when he
[26:50] gets over here in this part of his
[26:51] journey that's the same thing you do
[26:53] same thing all of us do thinking about
[26:55] this is today
[26:57] God's gonna come and he's gonna meet you
[26:59] in a powerful way somewhere
[27:03] now not every day sorry God don't work
[27:06] that way he's not a granddaddy he's a
[27:08] daddy
[27:10] daddy don't call me every day and say
[27:12] you behaving
[27:13] maybe should sometimes but he should
[27:16] have a long time ago but I mean really
[27:18] dining a bit know what you do son how
[27:20] you know y'all having a good day what
[27:22] are you doing today bowling ball of love
[27:23] you see you later what's what God is
[27:25] that's what God is he don't meddle in
[27:28] your business he knows what you're doing
[27:31] you don't have to ask
[27:33] but he's still down through your journey
[27:36] he just appears every once in a while
[27:39] gives you a little taste of this and the
[27:41] taste of that and he met Abram as
[27:44] Melchizedek in Abram the even the
[27:47] justification journey were he still had
[27:50] lot with him listen he had to go get lot
[27:52] so he had a lot with him but as he moved
[27:54] on into sanctification what God do God
[27:57] put Abram to sleep and said Abram you
[28:00] ain't got nothin to do with this
[28:03] I'm the one doing this because I'm gonna
[28:07] meet you again in human flesh and you're
[28:09] gonna identify who I am because they've
[28:10] already met you one time yeah
[28:13] amen
[28:16] Ezekiel 11 says
[28:18] and I will give them one heart and I
[28:21] will put a new spirit within you we
[28:23] already talked about this and I will
[28:25] take the stony heart of their out of
[28:26] their flesh and will give them a heart
[28:28] of flesh you had in justification you
[28:31] had that old stony heart hard man hard
[28:34] specially against other people specially
[28:37] against church folks really I mean you
[28:41] know you did because you're contrary
[28:43] Abram look Abram had lied that was that
[28:45] he hunted by Ellis he took his life with
[28:48] him that was about it pretty much but
[28:51] I'll give them one heart so in other
[28:53] words he he softens yup I
[28:56] love that in Ezekiel because that really
[28:59] tells you to what God is doing you can't
[29:02] change your heart
[29:04] you can't change your heart has to be
[29:07] God to change your heart from a stony
[29:09] heart to a heart of flesh so then so
[29:13] then let's identify that that was God
[29:15] that did it
[29:17] it wasn't you because if you justify
[29:20] yourself you still got the old stony
[29:21] heart it's gonna show up somewhere
[29:25] and you know what God's gonna make sure
[29:27] it shows up
[29:30] well him and his
[29:32] the devil is gonna do it but God is
[29:35] gonna show you who are you at hey you
[29:38] ain't got rid of that thing let me get
[29:40] rid of this and let me give you a softer
[29:44] heart so that I can start working with
[29:47] you and that's what he did with Abram
[29:48] but then Abram in chapter 18 comes into
[29:51] sanctification the Bible says after
[29:52] these things the word of the Lord comes
[29:54] to Abram in a vision so what you're
[29:56] doing is coming to Abram in a vision
[29:57] he's getting a little bit closer
[29:59] sanctification is getting just a little
[30:00] bit closer to God I
[30:03] mean God's right there the whole time
[30:05] you just gotta walk get rid of all this
[30:08] stuff
[30:08] so that God can deal with you because
[30:11] when Ezekiel tells us that he puts a new
[30:13] spirit in you
[30:16] its sanctification you get a new spirit
[30:18] not the Holy Spirit you get a spirit to
[30:21] be able to be a little to take that soft
[30:23] heart and be able to use it God can be
[30:25] able to use it a little bit more
[30:28] we know what the property guard said
[30:30] about sanctification that's cleaned and
[30:32] set aside for service not put in service
[30:34] but he cleans you up and sets you aside
[30:36] for service and he doesn't put anything
[30:38] in there yet because you've got a
[30:40] process to go through Abram you got to
[30:42] get to Abraham you got to walk this
[30:45] journey some of you some of us went
[30:49] through justification in a long period
[30:51] of time could be sanctification in a
[30:53] short period of time or it could have
[30:56] been a long period of time for us some
[30:57] of us not heads
[30:59] not you
[31:02] just your socks
[31:03] but some of us it took longer but you
[31:06] know what God it doesn't matter to God
[31:07] he knows the points
[31:09] he knows the points you've just got to
[31:12] get to them and when you get to him then
[31:14] God listen I'm gonna tell you Lord
[31:16] you're obligated to tell me where I'm at
[31:18] because he did Abram he told Abram
[31:22] robbery was that he told Ruth Robert she
[31:24] with that now not verbally but through
[31:27] somebody some preacher some elder some
[31:29] layperson some deacon somebody see mama
[31:32] your daddy whoever comes to you and says
[31:34] hey son I see you're not doing what you
[31:37] were doing before I see you in the room
[31:41] not slamming the computer when I
[31:45] walk in the door hello oh
[31:49] that's a good sign that they don't want
[31:51] you to see what you're looking at right
[31:54] okay but you've got that thing wide open
[31:57] and you hear good evening friends
[32:01] instead of trying to hide the volume
[32:03] from the rap music because all the other
[32:05] whatever's going on on the computer you
[32:08] know why because your life's open then
[32:10] you've got a new spirit you're heading
[32:13] toward the Holy Spirit but you got a new
[32:15] spirit that God is going man this is
[32:17] fresh I don't what did I see in that how
[32:20] many times that we looked at things even
[32:22] as I get older at sixty years old I was
[32:25] telling somebody work the other day I
[32:27] said the things that used to bother me
[32:30] don't bother me no more and I ain't
[32:32] talking about in Christian world so much
[32:34] I'm talking about just like general
[32:36] right
[32:38] we get our age you worry about survival
[32:41] oh
[32:42] I'm sorry you ain't this age you worry
[32:45] about survival he's not worried about
[32:48] survival he's
[32:51] like I gotta get a job
[32:55] the boys going y'all have more grandkids
[33:00] but you see
[33:02] my point is as we go through our
[33:04] Christian journey off a lot of the
[33:06] things that bothered us in our past
[33:07] don't bother us anymore it should not
[33:09] bother us anymore now don't say well now
[33:12] you well then well by the way this is
[33:14] gonna be easy no not easy
[33:16] it's not easy
[33:18] it wasn't easy for Abram look at the
[33:22] heartache and trials he went through
[33:26] God put him in a a vision in chapter 18
[33:31] our 6:15 put him to sleep and showed him
[33:35] hell
[33:36] this is what you deserve
[33:40] this is what you were headed to but I
[33:44] took you out you took the end it
[33:46] remember cuz what did Abram do before he
[33:48] got put to sleep he did everything God
[33:51] asked him to do take three Rams take
[33:54] three of this take two doves cut them to
[33:56] pieces push them out in front of you and
[34:00] keep the files off of them amen that's
[34:03] what that new spirit does it keeps the
[34:05] files out of off of you hey man keeps
[34:08] all them other foul spirits from coming
[34:10] back but you know what you were doing
[34:13] something to a point and then God shut
[34:16] it down God said now you're going to
[34:19] sleep Abram because I'm fixing to change
[34:22] you
[34:23] I'm fixing to change everything about
[34:26] you
[34:27] all these sacrifices and listen when
[34:31] you're in sanctification I know I did
[34:33] there was a lot of things I had to
[34:34] sacrifice my old friends the old way of
[34:38] what I was doing I had to get rid of a
[34:40] lot of stuff that I hid under the couch
[34:44] and then I had to get rid of that it was
[34:47] a sacrifice but you know what I was
[34:49] doing it because God had showed me
[34:52] what to do
[34:54] through the elders through the preachers
[34:56] through the message of the hour through
[34:58] the reasoning of the scripture God was
[35:00] showing me what I needed to kick out
[35:01] because remember in sanctification the
[35:04] Bible says the unclean spirit goes out
[35:05] now listen he doesn't go out willfully
[35:09] mine didn't
[35:11] my mines got my house and still got the
[35:14] claw marks on the wall as ice kicked
[35:16] that thing out
[35:17] all right I mean like
[35:20] and that's the truth because you had
[35:23] things in you that you had done for
[35:25] years
[35:26] didn't bother you to go sit and drink a
[35:28] beer
[35:29] we get my call here
[35:32] then Bobby go sent during late Louie's
[35:35] dick talking about didn't bother you bet
[35:37] now
[35:38] that demons gone because you don't want
[35:42] to do that no more because I'm
[35:44] gonna say that's probably get in trouble
[35:46] it's not the drinking part that bothers
[35:48] you because they tell you the Italians
[35:51] and all the different ones if you'll
[35:53] drink a little bit of wine every day it
[35:54] will help your intestines and it'll help
[35:56] you heart they have no heart trouble
[35:58] over there much at all anyway what I'm
[35:59] saying is it's all that stuff that goes
[36:02] with it right it's all them other demons
[36:05] that are hanging onto all that a man
[36:07] because you go to a bar in the first
[36:09] place you're you're not in the right
[36:11] place amen but you didn't mind going
[36:14] when you were a sinner because you know
[36:16] what that little guy inside of you was
[36:17] just as happy he's I thought we going
[36:19] the bar
[36:20] right we go on the bar right yeah boy it
[36:25] was like I got excited when I was but
[36:27] you know what he gets excited about
[36:28] something else now why because that
[36:31] demon
[36:32] had been kicked out and got sealed an it
[36:36] sealed it where that devil can't get
[36:37] back in there right okay but that's
[36:41] under sanctification the unclean spirit
[36:43] goes out not willingly but you know what
[36:46] he can't stand that new spirit you got
[36:50] cuz it's like this he can't stand it
[36:54] mine didn't oh thanks fog sure you get
[36:58] the same even your even your and I
[37:01] didn't drink a lot but even what I did
[37:03] my body craved and I know a lot of
[37:06] people were cigarette smokers but other
[37:07] time and different ones that that body
[37:09] was correct I didn't know you okay I
[37:11] mean three packs a day three demons a
[37:14] day all right great day so but that that
[37:17] has to do with your flesh a lot of times
[37:19] inside your body you did to inside your
[37:23] body now see I the problem with dipping
[37:25] or
[37:26] you know dipping scolding all that stuff
[37:28] but your body craved it well see you had
[37:31] to get rid of that when the demon went
[37:34] your body's still doing this hey man
[37:37] right yeah when I think god that's one
[37:41] thing he done for me because the day I
[37:42] walked up here and give my life to him I
[37:45] had pockets full of Scholl long cuts
[37:48] prayed I had it piled up in them you
[37:50] know if we're daddy couldn't see it I
[37:52] had hitting the house poor daddy mama
[37:55] couldn't see it but
[37:57] you know I didn't want that in the mall
[38:01] that demon just went on out
[38:03] and I said I know I don't need that no
[38:06] more so the very day and that you can't
[38:10] do that Coulter cued a lot of people
[38:11] even brother dick god bless him he had a
[38:14] problem with cigarettes a long time ago
[38:16] and he'll tell you they did he had
[38:17] brother Tom publisher and I you know you
[38:19] know you look at that demon your brother
[38:21] branham it's wonderful to have a prophet
[38:23] that tells you says I'd rather see my
[38:25] wife drunk on the floor right
[38:28] drunk on the floor then have a cigarette
[38:31] in her hand he knew the difference
[38:32] between the two demons he knew one had a
[38:35] bunch of tentacles than they were that
[38:37] thing was just gonna hold on to your
[38:38] body where the other one would not but
[38:41] we all had those but the unclean spirit
[38:44] goes out of sanctification because you
[38:46] know what you start going to church you
[38:47] start reading the Bible you start doing
[38:49] things you you change your environment
[38:50] Abram got up and left God took him to a
[38:54] places there are April I'm gonna you're
[38:56] dead cuz I'm fixing to kill you because
[39:00] remember Abraham's got to die
[39:02] so that Abraham can live I
[39:05] died like brother Dale said we our death
[39:08] has already happened
[39:11] death has no dominion over a Christian
[39:14] but like brother Clark said I do fear
[39:16] dying because there's always that
[39:20] you can't say when somebody puts a gun
[39:22] up to your head that you're not going to
[39:24] have a little sweat or a little
[39:26] sweat running down your armpits and a
[39:29] little bit of butterflies in your
[39:31] stomach why because you're still human
[39:32] even Jesus right before he went to the
[39:34] went to the crucifixion he said
[39:37] lord if this thing can pass for me let
[39:40] it pass the humanity part of me even
[39:42] when he was on the cross he said where
[39:44] are our lord who are you father where
[39:47] did you go in other words this hurts but
[39:50] he was so submissive just like Abram was
[39:53] so submissive to God that he just kept
[39:56] walking right on it doesn't matter what
[39:57] you know he had to get rid of lot
[39:59] he had to get rid of lot he had to keep
[40:02] walking then he comes to a place to
[40:03] where God brings a light down and he
[40:08] puts Abram to sleep and he says Abram I
[40:10] am going to do this for you
[40:15] because you can't do it by yourself
[40:19] that all right
[40:21] all these different things and then in
[40:24] chapter 16 we see that there was a wild
[40:26] child born out of Latin and we talked
[40:29] about that and discussed it but let's
[40:30] read this sanctification just for a
[40:32] second for both he that sanctifies and
[40:34] they who are sanctified are all of one
[40:36] Hebrews 2 verse 11 for which cause he is
[40:39] not ashamed to call them brethren saying
[40:41] I will declare thy name unto my brethren
[40:43] in the midst of the church well I've
[40:45] seen praises under the Ezekiel 36 25 go
[40:49] down to verse 26 a new heart also I give
[40:52] you now that was back there in
[40:53] justification all right a new heart also
[40:57] will I give you and a new spirit while I
[41:00] put within you why I'm gonna drive the
[41:02] unclean spirit out and I'm going to
[41:04] bring a spirit that we're gonna read
[41:06] about here in just a minute and I will
[41:08] take away the stony heart out of your
[41:10] flesh and I will give you a heart of
[41:11] flesh now number two his life in Christ
[41:13] brother Brown says he said he'd give you
[41:16] a new spirit now that spirit isn't God's
[41:18] Spirit that's your spirit God gives you
[41:20] a new spirit then he says I'll put my
[41:22] spirit in you but the thing God has to
[41:24] do is give you a new spirit make your
[41:26] nature a little more gentle and settle
[41:29] down or he couldn't even live with you
[41:32] so he has to get you fixed up first
[41:34] before he can come in okay and nobody
[41:39] knows that but God
[41:40] what you need and then and then if we
[41:45] try to figure it out sometimes we mess
[41:46] it up we just let God do it let right
[41:48] here I'm gonna fix you up before I come
[41:50] in I'll give you a new spirit then he
[41:52] take then you take him anywhere
[41:55] you go all kinds of places he's got to
[41:58] get you finished so you can entertain
[42:01] him right you're not going there
[42:03] tainting that new spirit in the bar room
[42:04] you're not going to retain that new
[42:05] spirit in front of whatever you've been
[42:07] watching on the Internet you're not
[42:08] going to entertain that whatever
[42:10] whatever just put it in there because
[42:12] God's not going to dwell in an unclean
[42:14] vessel that's why that's cleaned and set
[42:16] aside another in the analogy there's no
[42:19] water in here yet but it's clean on the
[42:21] outside it's clean on the inside
[42:23] so now God can at least put something
[42:26] clean inside of you and you want him to
[42:29] seal it in by the seal of circumcision
[42:32] so guess what
[42:36] if I had done that a few minutes ago the
[42:38] unclean spirit wouldn't went out and if
[42:41] I'd have done that and put it back under
[42:42] another spicket put it under a tap
[42:45] please put it under a tap you know the
[42:48] beer would go in it you understand one
[42:49] exam but when he seals it now when he
[42:51] gave Abraham a new name and the seal of
[42:54] circumcision he sealed that in no way
[42:59] that matter how much Satan shakes it
[43:03] it's God of what got a seal on it
[43:06] brother Brown said how dare anyone try
[43:09] to take that seal off of that boxcar
[43:11] what until its destination so you and I
[43:15] are coming to that now but we see that
[43:17] you get a new spirit
[43:20] Abram had a new walk of life
[43:23] he comes into chapter 18 and the Lord
[43:27] appeared unto him in the plains of
[43:29] memory now this is not in human flesh
[43:31] this is appeared it says in in
[43:35] the footnotes of doctors go fill the
[43:38] theophanies so he met God and that was a
[43:40] quote I was reading in there and I
[43:42] didn't have time to bring it out here
[43:43] where brother Brown said God hadn't met
[43:46] Abram in many different forms and heard
[43:50] his voice in many different ways he said
[43:53] but he's going to come down and he talks
[43:55] about it meeting him one time at the
[43:57] slaughter of the kings and meeting that
[43:59] same man over here when he gives him the
[44:02] promise of the promised child all right
[44:04] so look so God doesn't change
[44:07] God doesn't change he's if he met you
[44:10] and justification he's going to meet you
[44:13] at the baptism of the whole
[44:17] everybody got that say amen amen
[44:19] I love him how he's just absolutely to
[44:23] explain like brother Browns for the
[44:25] brother I'm saying I'm most illiterate
[44:26] person can understand the new birth why
[44:30] is the walk of life it's your physical
[44:33] walk how you walk in your line all the
[44:36] stories of Abraham Abram Ruth and Naomi
[44:41] we'll get into that Sunday I believe in
[44:43] an extra and all the different ones that
[44:45] that never had the new birth
[44:48] folks never had the new birth even an
[44:51] extra God's not even mentioned in there
[44:53] but we know that he was the one that was
[44:55] doing the leading
[44:56] but you see Esther walking through this
[44:59] whole part of this journey and it was a
[45:01] journey of what me and you same thing
[45:04] becomes the bride of all different
[45:07] brides has a little man named Mordecai
[45:09] little short guy means little man you
[45:11] know that what guides her along he's not
[45:14] the king
[45:16] mind you
[45:18] Mordecai was not the king the Kings the
[45:22] king that's why brother branham's not
[45:24] God
[45:26] he's the eliazar he's the he's the
[45:29] Mordecai he's the one that presents the
[45:32] bride to the bridegroom now he's part of
[45:35] that bride
[45:36] but he's never the bridegroom there's
[45:40] only one bridegroom and that's Jesus
[45:41] Christ hey ma'am so listen I know we
[45:44] don't have that problem but and somebody
[45:45] may have been listening in the end or
[45:46] watching in I don't know that wasn't in
[45:48] my notes but the Lord appeared him in
[45:50] the point it appeared to him now we're
[45:52] in chapter 18 so we can go ahead and
[45:55] take bring check chapter 18 up let's go
[45:58] through this real quick now remember
[46:01] we come to this part of the new birth in
[46:07] type that we went through justification
[46:10] he's he's chopped off her past sins
[46:12] Abram is still walking making mistakes
[46:15] taking a lot with him and then he's
[46:17] gonna have to separate from lot and then
[46:19] he goes into sanctification where God
[46:21] puts him to sleep shows him what hell is
[46:24] and shows him all the different things
[46:25] and that little white light brother
[46:27] Brown said that amber light
[46:29] he's right there with Abram
[46:31] he was right there with you the whole
[46:34] time you may not have physically been
[46:36] able to see it but you should have been
[46:37] able to see it in the characteristics of
[46:39] things that you went through in your
[46:41] journey a man because you say that was
[46:44] God you come through something you say
[46:46] there's nobody could know that do that
[46:48] or explain that but God Almighty and it
[46:52] might have come from a preacher
[46:54] talking to you our buddies talking to
[46:57] you a Christian man and then you go huh
[47:00] and then you realize that that was God
[47:03] talking to you the whole time
[47:05] Abram I believe when Abram comes down to
[47:08] Abraham and he meets milk is it for the
[47:10] second time we're gonna read it milk
[47:11] hesitate for the second time he's going
[47:14] taste something special about this guy
[47:16] right here there's something special not
[47:19] about me I'm not special no because God
[47:22] makes him special
[47:23] God said can I hold withholding anything
[47:25] from Abraham being that he's the heir of
[47:28] this earth I will read it in just a
[47:31] second but Abraham didn't get the big
[47:34] head and even if he did get the big head
[47:37] about ten years later God's fixing to
[47:39] Humble him
[47:41] he's fixing to tell him whatever I gave
[47:43] you you gonna take and kill it so here
[47:46] we go let's go to chapter 18
[47:49] all right now we know one thing's for
[47:52] sure chapter 17 we talked about the new
[47:55] birth right so we don't have to go back
[47:57] to that JEP chapter 17 was he gave him
[47:59] now listen let me read you a couple of
[48:01] things that brother Brown talks about
[48:02] just for a second about circumcision
[48:05] because in Ezekiel 36 in finishing the
[48:08] the scripture that we read he says I'll
[48:10] put my spirit within you so now we see
[48:13] that God is gonna put his spirit now he
[48:15] didn't he didn't give you his spirit of
[48:17] sanctification he gave you a spirit to
[48:20] deal with what's coming
[48:23] to deal with what's nice if you didn't
[48:25] see that in your journey
[48:27] that God changed you just a little bit
[48:30] so he could deal with you
[48:32] like he'd never dealt with you before
[48:35] but when you come to that part of the
[48:37] new birth he says in verse 27 don't go
[48:39] there I will put my spirit within you
[48:42] and call you to walk in my statutes and
[48:44] you shall keep my judgments and do them
[48:47] arts because you've got his spirit
[48:50] inside of you then you've not got a
[48:51] different spirit or a familiar spirit or
[48:54] any you've got him and that's the new
[48:57] Burke and and to confirm Abraham's faith
[49:01] God gave him the sign of circumcision
[49:05] let's read this right here real quick
[49:09] let's go to number four if you don't
[49:11] mind switch back to that I need to read
[49:13] that before we go through
[49:14] hidden life in Christ
[49:17] 1956 there you go many times God said
[49:20] I'll give you a new spirit that wasn't
[49:22] his spirit that's your spirit then I'll
[49:24] put my spirit in you I'll give you a new
[49:26] spirit then I will put my spirit in you
[49:28] and many times you get the new spirit
[49:31] and think you've got the holy spirit
[49:32] that's why it's real hard for us to just
[49:36] sit back and
[49:37] say this feels good and not going with
[49:42] God and listen if you don't get it
[49:45] sealed up guess what there's that
[49:47] entrance right back again to where that
[49:49] unclean spirit will go right back in
[49:50] there take seven demons worse than he
[49:53] was before and make you a religious
[49:56] person not a worse worldly person
[49:59] because if you want to be religious
[50:01] listen Satan will get you religious
[50:03] Satan is a religious person he's not a
[50:06] boring game person but he's a religious
[50:07] person
[50:10] remember he was the anointed cherubim he
[50:14] knows all about the feelings of
[50:15] anointing and how to bend you and move
[50:17] you into trying to say hey everything's
[50:20] fine listen even though I brother Dale
[50:23] at 80 years old been a Christian for
[50:24] probably 60 years or longer he's I
[50:27] believe he's never come to a day to
[50:29] where he says I'm satisfied
[50:31] you should never come to a day where you
[50:33] said this is that I'm satisfied I'm done
[50:35] I don't have to do any more I'm finished
[50:36] this is that
[50:38] and see what's gonna happen is though if
[50:40] you start saying that this is what's
[50:42] gonna happen and you see that not so
[50:44] much in this church but it has happened
[50:46] to several you see them come in and
[50:48] they're all on fire for God and they're
[50:50] all gonna do this and they want to do
[50:51] that because they got that new spirit
[50:53] they feel good they feel good they get
[50:55] onto the atmosphere but when the word
[50:57] starts pounding and it has nothing to
[51:01] respond to everybody got that there's
[51:05] nothing to respond to that
[51:07] where do they go they have to leave they
[51:11] cannot sit here and listen I mean
[51:14] anywhere I'm not saying just here in
[51:15] this physical place you can't sit in the
[51:17] place and keep hearing the Word of God
[51:19] every day every hour every time you come
[51:22] to church you hear in the Word of God
[51:23] you're hearing somebody preaching the
[51:25] Word of God and you're saying a man and
[51:27] you're going man this is good but I'm
[51:29] just maybe I just not gonna I think I'll
[51:32] go fishing next Sunday
[51:35] go ahead because you'll go fishing the
[51:38] next Sunday and the next Sunday because
[51:40] you know what that fishing spirit
[51:44] that maybe with something else that made
[51:46] you fish on Saturday it's now saying
[51:49] well that's okay brother Dale preaches
[51:50] the same thing over and over again
[51:52] brother Wade he just reads the same
[51:53] quotes five or six Sundays in a row I
[51:55] think I'll gonna go fishing well you
[51:57] know what that ain't the Holy Ghost
[51:58] water
[51:59] because that inside of you that is his
[52:03] spirit of where he is that's where you
[52:05] need to be right
[52:08] it's just real simple you see him come
[52:12] in there on fire for God they've got
[52:13] this new spear and they got this new
[52:14] attitude and then all of a sudden
[52:16] you see them six months later and
[52:19] women's cut their hair and you know and
[52:21] they're ashamed of themself like you
[52:23] wouldn't believe would hide under a
[52:25] penny if they could
[52:27] but you know what happened was they got
[52:29] a new spirit but they didn't get the
[52:31] holy spirit they still was Abram which
[52:34] was journeying around and making
[52:36] mistakes and flip-flopping listen not
[52:38] saying they can't come back
[52:41] never let God close the door we don't I
[52:45] want this church full of them people
[52:46] that's on this wall right down here
[52:48] under my feet because some of them is
[52:50] mine hey man I'll clap myself
[52:54] [Applause]
[52:57] but that's what happened when you don't
[52:59] get the Holy Spirit you'll get a spirit
[53:01] alright
[53:02] you'll get a spear and you'll get a
[53:04] religious spirit but what happened Abram
[53:07] Abram just kept on walking
[53:09] kept on walking God you promised
[53:12] now I've come to a place now where God
[53:15] says I'm gonna change your name to
[53:17] Abraham
[53:19] because as Abram you were high father
[53:21] now you couldn't do anything with that
[53:23] name of the promise I was going to give
[53:25] you but as Abraham
[53:28] brother Graham said give him part of his
[53:30] name ham him Elohim ham give me part of
[53:33] his name and he said now you're a father
[53:36] of many nations now
[53:38] it didn't even look good at that point
[53:41] it was Abraham dried up and dead Sarah
[53:45] womb was not able to conceive even when
[53:48] she was 16 so there was something going
[53:50] on there all right God had to totally
[53:54] change their body and change the
[53:57] configuration of her
[53:59] bride does he not have to change the
[54:03] configuration of me and you to receive
[54:07] the promised seed
[54:09] that's what he had to do to Sarah he
[54:13] didn't just change her body she was at
[54:16] one time 18 years old and lived with
[54:19] Abraham Abram for all them years and
[54:21] never had no kids but
[54:24] they come to a point to where God just
[54:27] kept on going I mean Abram just kept on
[54:30] going and Abram got to a place to where
[54:33] God said I
[54:34] trust you now
[54:37] go that's what he's gonna tell him over
[54:39] there in when he gets ready to kill
[54:40] Isaac he's gonna tell him to die that's
[54:42] what brother Branham says he says oh
[54:43] I've got you this point he said I can
[54:46] trust even the Bible says and and you
[54:48] say well was that God trusted no God
[54:52] already knew what was going to happen he
[54:54] just wanted Abraham to know
[54:56] that I am whatever I told you I am I'm
[55:00] still going to keep that promise
[55:02] I'm on the scene more now than I was
[55:05] then
[55:07] if we ever get to that
[55:11] we're man I'll give you a new spirit
[55:14] then I'll put my spirit in you and many
[55:16] times you get the new spirit and think
[55:18] you've got the holy spirit and trusting
[55:19] upon emotions and signs and things see
[55:21] that's why God put Abram to sleep they
[55:25] went a signer I wonder when Abram was
[55:27] asleep my brother Bram said he's zeroed
[55:30] you out
[55:31] Abram you have nothing to do with this
[55:34] alright and trusting upon emotions and
[55:37] signs and things when your life doesn't
[55:39] PV up to that see that's just a little
[55:41] wrong but remember it's the truth
[55:43] alright let's finish the rest of that
[55:45] one let's go to
[55:46] I
[55:48] want to read number six
[55:52] number six if you'll pull up number six
[55:55] we'll skip number five and number six
[55:56] why some people can't keep the victory
[55:58] it's a pretty good that's a pretty good
[56:01] that's pretty good sermon why some
[56:04] people can't keep the victory maybe we
[56:05] ought to read that everyone's name now
[56:08] many times we try to make that thing say
[56:10] just well as soon as you get the new
[56:11] spirit you quit you're stealing quit
[56:13] your line see what I mean unclean spirit
[56:15] goes out things like that you say Oh
[56:17] hallelujah I got it and you find out the
[56:21] first time anyone crosses your path a
[56:23] little bit old mercy what a difference
[56:24] sure
[56:25] you blow up like a frog eating buckshot
[56:29] we've seen that happen just
[56:32] because a certain person didn't get a
[56:34] birthday party and they went and brother
[56:36] Dale
[56:36] people left left the church that's the
[56:40] truth and ain't been back since
[56:43] so see what I mean with the Holy Spirit
[56:48] though you can't do that
[56:50] you'll do this right here you'll be like
[56:52] a frog eating buckshot but let me tell
[56:54] you brother that's the reason you never
[56:56] got God's Spirit that's true oh he
[56:59] stepped on my toe I'll just not put up
[57:00] with that alright that shows what you
[57:02] got in you that's true I'll put a new
[57:04] spirit in you then I'll put my spirit in
[57:06] you now the heart is the center of the
[57:09] emotions of the human being not this
[57:11] heart but the center part of you alright
[57:14] is the center of the emotions of the
[57:17] human being your heart is the middle of
[57:20] you that's exactly right so God puts a
[57:23] new spirit in the middle of the old man
[57:26] sanctification
[57:27] then he puts a new spirit in the middle
[57:31] of the new spirit
[57:32] or heart and put his spirit in the
[57:35] middle of the new spirit
[57:38] takes out the stony heart
[57:41] then he puts in his spirit to get along
[57:44] with us then he puts his spirit in the
[57:48] center of that because you know what
[57:49] well you don't get the Holy Ghost on
[57:51] your spirit you don't get it on just on
[57:53] your body you get it in the center in
[57:56] the middle of the new spirit God puts
[57:59] that down now that's not three or four
[58:01] spirits running around it's the same
[58:03] Holy Spirit doing different words at
[58:04] different times everybody got that same
[58:06] man I don't want you to be confused on
[58:08] that we got all kind of spirits running
[58:09] around in us if you're not born again
[58:11] you do
[58:14] you ain't got you ain't got the Holy
[58:17] Spirit you got ever spare in the world
[58:18] running around inside of you but when
[58:21] you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[58:22] your soul that's one
[58:24] that's one that's the I am NOT the I was
[58:28] not the I'm gonna be not the I'm three
[58:30] or four I'm one amen you didn't receive
[58:34] the third person of the Trinity
[58:38] you received the only person of the
[58:41] Trinity the
[58:42] Lord Jesus Christ in spirit form of the
[58:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost everybody know
[58:48] that I'm sure you do all right now look
[58:51] at number seven Israel in the church
[58:53] beautiful God took Christ at Calvary
[58:55] took him apart soul and body since the
[58:57] body upon his right hand and sent the
[58:59] Holy Spirit back to covenant with the
[59:00] people and you believe by faith like
[59:03] Abraham did and he was given the seal of
[59:07] circumcision for a confirmation of his
[59:10] faith
[59:12] okay for a confirmation of his faith
[59:17] and you believe and accept Jesus as your
[59:22] Savior then God gives you the baptism of
[59:24] the Holy Ghost as a confirmation of your
[59:26] faith and
[59:29] you say you say you believe and haven't
[59:32] received the Holy Spirit something's
[59:34] wrong with your faith God circumcised is
[59:36] the heart the minute the believer really
[59:39] comes in full surrender
[59:41] amen say Amen say that folks surely must
[59:46] have done something I felt that even
[59:47] come back he felt he was like I said
[59:50] before he was amongst a bunch of
[59:51] Pentecostals who said I shouted I spoke
[59:53] in tongues so I must have the Holy Ghost
[59:55] so he's the seller right here
[59:57] when the believer firmly believes on the
[1:00:01] Lord Jesus Christ God's under obligation
[1:00:05] see when Abram started this journey and
[1:00:08] this person this I am that's going to do
[1:00:11] everything for him when he met Abram it
[1:00:15] wasn't a different person then he met
[1:00:17] over here like I said before it was the
[1:00:19] same person with the same characteristic
[1:00:21] so Abraham or Abram could identify who
[1:00:24] he was you and I must identify where God
[1:00:27] is in your journey
[1:00:30] why by knowing where you are in your
[1:00:33] journey
[1:00:36] then God gives you the baptism of the
[1:00:38] Holy Ghost as a confirmation of your
[1:00:40] faith when the believer firmly believes
[1:00:43] on the Lord Jesus Christ God under his
[1:00:45] under obligation to give him the Holy
[1:00:48] Ghost confirmation of his face say
[1:00:50] what's the matter brother Branham just
[1:00:52] your faith that's all see he could feel
[1:00:55] it coming from them Pentecostals I
[1:00:57] needed to shout I need to speak in
[1:00:58] tongues I need to do this I need to do
[1:01:00] that and it that's not the promise the
[1:01:02] promise is an unconditional covenant the
[1:01:04] promise they're saying condition now
[1:01:07] they could do that afterwards they could
[1:01:10] do all that afterwards but he's got to
[1:01:14] it's just your faith that's all if you'd
[1:01:18] surely believed God's there to give it
[1:01:20] to you I was thinking about this
[1:01:21] yesterday the very reason that God could
[1:01:24] give listen to this the very reason God
[1:01:27] could give Luther the baptism of the
[1:01:29] Holy Ghost is that Luther believed that
[1:01:33] the just shall live by faith
[1:01:35] so God honored that faith and gave him
[1:01:39] the new birth now whatever he did after
[1:01:42] that he didn't have enough word to not
[1:01:44] know not to smoke or drink or no I mean
[1:01:46] yeah just smoking do that
[1:01:49] but right here I was reading this quote
[1:01:51] and I said man that's how God give the
[1:01:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost to Martin
[1:01:56] Luther who was a Trinitarian but he
[1:01:58] believed he has faith
[1:02:01] that's all if you'd surely believed
[1:02:05] God's there to give it to you and Martin
[1:02:08] Luther believed when he read that he
[1:02:09] said the just shall live by faith in
[1:02:12] Martin Luther said a man ain't God
[1:02:15] filled him with the baptism of the holy
[1:02:16] God hey man I love the Word of God
[1:02:20] it's good stuff
[1:02:22] good stuff
[1:02:24] number eight God's commissioning Moses
[1:02:27] three just real quick and then we'll get
[1:02:28] to
[1:02:29] because we got the circumcision lit it's
[1:02:31] not just a sign it's it's a sign of your
[1:02:35] faith
[1:02:37] he honored Abraham's faith by making an
[1:02:40] Abraham and then by that faith that
[1:02:43] Abraham now had God gave him a seal of
[1:02:48] circumcision and say okay I'm gonna give
[1:02:52] you a sign a
[1:02:54] physical sign now because I can't give
[1:02:56] you a spiritual sign I'm giving you a
[1:02:57] physical sign right now because I can't
[1:03:00] go inside of you because the blood of
[1:03:02] bulls and goats didn't clean Abram or
[1:03:04] Abraham enough inside so that God could
[1:03:07] dwell in him now it's just simple you
[1:03:09] can't get the new birth under bulls and
[1:03:11] goats
[1:03:12] it's just period you can't
[1:03:15] because remember it's only a covering it
[1:03:18] only pushes your sin to Calvary but by
[1:03:21] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:23] I thought you don't have a sin
[1:03:28] show me what oh I did oh there you go
[1:03:34] but God gave him the seal of
[1:03:36] circumcision as a seal of his faith
[1:03:40] brethren when you get pure genuine faith
[1:03:43] in God God will give you the baptism of
[1:03:47] the Holy Ghost as a seal of the promise
[1:03:51] which is a seal that you have faith oh
[1:03:57] that you have faith
[1:04:00] listen I gotta have faith like I said
[1:04:03] it's telling you before I gotta have
[1:04:05] that same faith that justification I've
[1:04:07] got to believe that a man called Jesus
[1:04:09] Christ died for my sin
[1:04:13] heroes to justify the world
[1:04:18] but only certain ones some justify
[1:04:20] herself if Jesus Christ justifies me I'm
[1:04:23] okay and man because he's covered all my
[1:04:27] sin took my justification and that's why
[1:04:30] he said the just and the justifier it's
[1:04:33] the same person you
[1:04:34] and I are just as eternal is God if we
[1:04:38] have the new birth
[1:04:40] amen and now what the prophet tells us
[1:04:43] which is a seal that you have faith you
[1:04:47] might make some kind of impression or
[1:04:49] make people believe or you might say you
[1:04:51] got faith but when you really got
[1:04:52] genuine ultra underrated faith God will
[1:04:56] give you the baptismal Holy Ghost as a
[1:04:58] seal of the promise that's not skim milk
[1:05:01] now children
[1:05:04] but remember Paul goes on in Romans will
[1:05:08] not read it now but Paul goes on there
[1:05:11] in Romans you can read it later on if
[1:05:13] you want to
[1:05:14] and he goes on in Romans and tells us
[1:05:16] what does he tell us he said it's not
[1:05:20] physical circumcision anymore it's a
[1:05:24] circumcision of the heart it's a
[1:05:27] circumcision to wear when you walk you
[1:05:30] walk different you talk different your
[1:05:34] whole makeup is different
[1:05:35] everything you do is different why would
[1:05:38] you want to do the same thing you know
[1:05:40] what I was thinking this other day that
[1:05:44] the definition of insanity is what doing
[1:05:48] the same thing over and over and
[1:05:50] expecting a different result
[1:05:52] that's insanity that is the true
[1:05:55] definition of insanity people that are
[1:05:58] insane do the same thing over and over
[1:06:00] again but expecting a different result
[1:06:02] something better something different but
[1:06:05] it's not
[1:06:07] that's the same thing with you and I if
[1:06:10] you're not born again you're insane
[1:06:13] because you're trying to do this you're
[1:06:15] trying to do that you're trying to and
[1:06:17] get the results that God wants to give
[1:06:19] you and you just you you don't have
[1:06:21] nothing in there but when you get God in
[1:06:24] there like I said before that's your
[1:06:25] spiritual rudder
[1:06:27] now you can pray for them people that
[1:06:30] are in borrow in bars you pray for the
[1:06:32] people that used to do what you used to
[1:06:34] do or that still does what you used to
[1:06:36] do
[1:06:39] listen
[1:06:41] but there was one thing for sure
[1:06:43] when you come to a place to where you
[1:06:46] get born again a lot of times for
[1:06:49] periods of time you have to walk alone
[1:06:52] just like Abraham did he had no friends
[1:06:54] right there until but remember lot had
[1:06:57] already moved to Sodom and Gomorrah all
[1:06:59] he had was him and his wife and his
[1:07:00] servants that's all he had he'd have
[1:07:03] nothing else he'd have a congregation
[1:07:07] but he's fixing the meet Melchizedek and
[1:07:10] when he meets Melchizedek
[1:07:12] there and we look in chapter 18
[1:07:16] finally
[1:07:18] now you can pull up chapter 18 now let's
[1:07:20] read chapter 18 we may not get to 20 I
[1:07:22] don't want to get past about 8:30 and
[1:07:25] the Lord appeared unto him in the plains
[1:07:26] of Mamre appeared
[1:07:28] unto him and the plains of Mamre and he
[1:07:31] sat in the tent door at the heat of the
[1:07:33] day and he lifted up his eyes and looked
[1:07:35] and lo three men stood by him now we
[1:07:37] know who brother Brown tells us that was
[1:07:40] that was God Almighty in human flesh and
[1:07:43] two angels that were going to go to
[1:07:44] Sodom now we know that the
[1:07:46] characteristics of that was all Roberts
[1:07:49] and Billy Graham they didn't stay with
[1:07:51] the elect by the branch then they went
[1:07:54] down to Sodom to do what blind the
[1:07:56] people
[1:07:57] right
[1:08:01] but I remember
[1:08:04] they weren't demons they were guarding
[1:08:07] human flesh -
[1:08:11] whoa
[1:08:13] Billy Graham or Roberts well they never
[1:08:16] come in a message Church they had a job
[1:08:18] to do
[1:08:19] they had a job to do I believe we'll see
[1:08:21] them there just as much and their whole
[1:08:23] crowd of people that they got saved
[1:08:24] under what they believed I
[1:08:27] don't believe they spoke to thousands of
[1:08:30] millions of people all their life and
[1:08:32] God's gonna come up to the end and say
[1:08:33] we didn't believe the Prophet
[1:08:35] no they believed who they were they
[1:08:39] believed they had message and they were
[1:08:41] identified by the messenger of the hour
[1:08:44] thank God
[1:08:46] that they were identified that they were
[1:08:49] to go to Sodom had a job to blind the
[1:08:52] people in Sodom and to call the lot
[1:08:55] group out so if they called the lakh
[1:08:57] group out they must have preached him
[1:08:59] some kind of truth or they wouldn't get
[1:09:02] in
[1:09:03] amen I just believe that you hear a lot
[1:09:06] of people in the message say that they
[1:09:07] can't believe that bro that Billy Graham
[1:09:09] had Holy Ghost and and didn't sit under
[1:09:12] brother Browns ministry he didn't have
[1:09:14] brother bountiful ministry he had his
[1:09:16] own ministry John G Lake all the
[1:09:19] different ones of Dwight Moody you can't
[1:09:21] say they weren't born again they were
[1:09:22] born-again believers
[1:09:24] Smith Wigglesworth all these different
[1:09:26] ones but brother Branham was the
[1:09:28] identified prophet in the Bible
[1:09:31] but you got to look into seeing the
[1:09:33] Bible there there's Billy Graham when
[1:09:35] Oral Roberts identified in the Bible as
[1:09:37] the two angels that went to Sodom to
[1:09:40] draw a lot out so let's read right here
[1:09:42] and three men stood by him and when he
[1:09:44] saw them he ran to meet them from the
[1:09:46] tent door and bowed himself toward the
[1:09:48] ground and he said my lord
[1:09:50] now I'm going to interpolate just a
[1:09:54] moment
[1:09:55] he said my lord
[1:09:58] good to see you again
[1:10:01] so that was Melchizedek then that was
[1:10:04] the same Melchizedek in verses in
[1:10:05] Chapter 15 or 13 right good to see you
[1:10:09] again Lord I know what you was then but
[1:10:12] I know what you are more now I know why
[1:10:14] you're coming I know why you're here
[1:10:17] we're fixing to we tried to fulfill the
[1:10:20] promise this way I made a mistake we
[1:10:21] tried to go over this way I made a
[1:10:23] mistake but no I'm going to meet you
[1:10:26] right here my lord if now I have found
[1:10:30] favor in thy sight pass not away from my
[1:10:35] servant
[1:10:36] stay here in commune with him because I
[1:10:39] know more about you now than I did when
[1:10:40] I was well we're not when you were
[1:10:42] Melchizedek to give me to give me
[1:10:44] communion you were a man that I was
[1:10:47] probably tired that day we'd been we'd
[1:10:49] killed a bunch of people and slaughtered
[1:10:51] the kings and we had brought lot and I
[1:10:53] was really tired I just really didn't
[1:10:55] have time to really recognize said but
[1:10:58] all now I know who you are I know why
[1:11:01] you met me then and I sure know how I
[1:11:04] you met me now because you're the same
[1:11:06] person and he didn't lose his
[1:11:08] characteristic either and man I mean we
[1:11:11] we do we put a lot on milk katsudon
[1:11:13] we're brother Brown says he put a little
[1:11:15] 16 elements over his body and he had to
[1:11:18] do the same thing to meet him in Genesis
[1:11:19] chapter 13 or he wouldn't have seen him
[1:11:22] he gave him communion and Abraham paid
[1:11:25] the man ties
[1:11:30] you can't pay ties to a theophany right
[1:11:33] he's gotta have some flesh on it so
[1:11:37] Abram I recognized him said my lord now
[1:11:39] he didn't recognize him other truth
[1:11:41] right
[1:11:44] my lord he knew who was the important
[1:11:48] one
[1:11:49] let a little water I pray thee be
[1:11:51] fetched and wash your feet and rest
[1:11:53] yourself under the tree and I will fetch
[1:11:56] a morsel of bread and comfort in you
[1:11:58] your heart after that you shall pass on
[1:12:01] for therefore you come to your servant
[1:12:04] and you said so do as thou has done has
[1:12:07] said and remember what Abraham done told
[1:12:11] of verse 8 God
[1:12:13] ate a cow
[1:12:15] he had a state had corn bread had to be
[1:12:19] southern drank some milk could have been
[1:12:22] could have been buttermilk never know
[1:12:24] but he had butter you know you
[1:12:26] understand what I'm saying you
[1:12:27] understand what I'm saying about this
[1:12:28] this was not a as brother Dale says many
[1:12:30] times this was not a we're not supposed
[1:12:32] to shake hands but hey no cousin ain't
[1:12:34] well god bless you I've got a cow
[1:12:36] already cooked for you know the Bible
[1:12:39] says he told his servant go out there
[1:12:43] now how many of you he knows one of them
[1:12:45] we've seen slaughter we we've even you
[1:12:47] know by the time you I'm sorry sorry
[1:12:50] ladies you go to deer skin and skin a
[1:12:52] deer go to deer skin a deer core terima
[1:12:55] it took an hour right resting at least
[1:12:57] an hour now listen he had to make butter
[1:13:00] he had to churn he had to milk the cow
[1:13:04] somebody did milk the cow what am I
[1:13:07] saying he communed with him a long
[1:13:09] period of time
[1:13:10] long period of time hours this man said
[1:13:14] in front of that tent as
[1:13:16] Abraham by faith
[1:13:21] produced
[1:13:24] meat that was cooked not only that you
[1:13:28] got to have the meat there he had it
[1:13:30] cooked and he made hoecakes brother
[1:13:33] breakfast as in one quote again hoecakes
[1:13:35] which for those of you that are not from
[1:13:36] the south that would be cornbread and
[1:13:39] for those of you that are not from the
[1:13:40] south that's not with sugar in it either
[1:13:42] cornbread is made with cornmeal
[1:13:47] and God liked it because he eat it
[1:13:50] so there was a period of time you see
[1:13:52] what I'm saying Abraham says right here
[1:13:54] watch this right here verse 5 go back to
[1:13:57] verse 5 for
[1:14:00] therefore are you come to your servant
[1:14:07] remember I said cleaned and set aside
[1:14:10] for service but what is the baptism with
[1:14:13] Holy Ghost God puts you in service you
[1:14:17] become a servant and you know what God
[1:14:20] did God said God set there you know what
[1:14:24] all milk has it what had to done says
[1:14:26] milk butter
[1:14:29] cook filets
[1:14:32] cornbread right he's Almighty God
[1:14:36] but he let Abraham show his face
[1:14:40] he lets you show your face
[1:14:43] he sat down watched Abraham
[1:14:46] not a pretty sight had to kill the cow
[1:14:49] get it skin it got it quarter it
[1:14:53] cook it
[1:14:55] while Sarah was probably cooking the
[1:14:57] whole case
[1:14:58] what flour eggs forgive me sister's not
[1:15:03] flour cornmeal and whatever else you put
[1:15:06] in it and you know what how long does it
[1:15:08] take to cook cornbread even in a
[1:15:10] conviction conventional good oven that
[1:15:12] we have takes 30 minutes or longer now
[1:15:16] they were doing it over a fire they
[1:15:18] didn't go out ask go to Longhorns
[1:15:21] here's my point God was watching Abraham
[1:15:25] and he was saying
[1:15:28] you're learning son you're learning to
[1:15:32] be a servant I've give you the seal of
[1:15:35] circumcision and two four and five
[1:15:38] thousand years later they're gonna talk
[1:15:40] about what you did as you just thought
[1:15:43] you were doing me a favor by cooking me
[1:15:46] a meal but now we're down come to the
[1:15:49] close to the end time and we're able to
[1:15:50] put it in our to put it in our language
[1:15:53] or to put it in our life that God wants
[1:15:56] to see a servant
[1:15:58] God wants to see a servant somebody that
[1:16:01] he he wants to make sure that you know
[1:16:03] your servant Abraham
[1:16:05] therefore are you come to your servant
[1:16:08] and I'm fixing to serve you cuz I gotta
[1:16:10] kill this cow I got to cook this cow got
[1:16:12] to make the whole cake and if she made
[1:16:14] butter I don't know how it takes a long
[1:16:16] time to make butter out daddy saying
[1:16:17] I've never seen they churn it they take
[1:16:20] butter and something else and they do
[1:16:21] this right here in a little stick going
[1:16:23] up and down the panel to turn to make
[1:16:25] butter it takes hours so what am I
[1:16:28] saying is it went just like well hello
[1:16:29] Abraham how you doing we got to go down
[1:16:31] beside him I see you later that's not
[1:16:33] the way God is God communed with Abraham
[1:16:36] he commits he love there's no other
[1:16:40] place
[1:16:41] there's no other place he'd rather be
[1:16:43] than commune with you
[1:16:45] he would have been somewhere else cuz
[1:16:49] he's Almighty God nobody came to Abraham
[1:16:51] and said Abraham
[1:16:52] Here I am let's talk for a little while
[1:16:59] and you say Lord let me cook you
[1:17:01] something he says okay where the carcass
[1:17:05] is
[1:17:06] there's were the eagle to be gay
[1:17:08] what is the carcass we're not cooking
[1:17:12] cows and hoe cakes we're coming to
[1:17:16] church
[1:17:17] we're being servants we're reading our
[1:17:19] Bible we're study and we're praying and
[1:17:21] God's going just like your father
[1:17:24] Abraham you're just like you cuz we're
[1:17:28] the seed of Abraham for the seed of
[1:17:30] Abraham we got act like our seed
[1:17:32] and man
[1:17:33] so let's go a little bit further around
[1:17:35] here real quick and they did eat verse 9
[1:17:41] then remembering you know they he says
[1:17:43] for Sarah you're the wife
[1:17:45] we're Sarah your wife he said behold in
[1:17:48] the tent and
[1:17:49] he said I will certainly return unto
[1:17:52] thee ah
[1:17:54] personally I'm not going to send up one
[1:17:56] of these two right here
[1:17:58] these two right here has got a job
[1:18:00] somewhere else these two angels that are
[1:18:03] eating and they're watching you and but
[1:18:05] their eyes if you'll notice their eyes
[1:18:06] was always turned to Sodom because they
[1:18:09] had a job to do down there they didn't
[1:18:11] have a job to do with Abraham because
[1:18:12] Abraham and had a name change and God
[1:18:15] was sitting there talking to him so they
[1:18:17] kept their mouth shut
[1:18:20] then alright I will certainly return
[1:18:25] unto thee according to the time of life
[1:18:27] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[1:18:31] remember what happened Sarah just kind
[1:18:34] of
[1:18:37] now Abraham and Sarah will well
[1:18:40] stricking the age that were nineteen
[1:18:42] nineteen ninety I guess you might say
[1:18:44] and it seems to be with Sarah after the
[1:18:46] manner of women watch she dried up for
[1:18:48] woman dried up she had no more
[1:18:50] she couldn't produce a child if she
[1:18:52] wasn't that way
[1:18:54] that's why I said God's not God just
[1:18:56] change us he's got to change us from the
[1:18:58] inside out first
[1:19:00] they been okay with what I just said he
[1:19:03] had to change Sarah from the inside
[1:19:06] to the outside I
[1:19:09] like that he did he had to change her
[1:19:12] physical inside her womb not just make
[1:19:15] it young he had to change it so that she
[1:19:18] could receive the promised child same
[1:19:20] well with you now therefore Sarah left
[1:19:22] within ourselves and my wife sold it and
[1:19:24] I have pleasure shall I have pleasure my
[1:19:27] lord being old also she remembered when
[1:19:30] you know what she's saying if we were
[1:19:33] young again
[1:19:34] we might have pleasure but I I can't
[1:19:38] conceive
[1:19:39] that's why she kind of giggled and said
[1:19:42] man this guy was telling us we're gonna
[1:19:44] have a kid
[1:19:46] but you know what God said and the Lord
[1:19:48] said unto Abraham he never talked to
[1:19:50] Sarah
[1:19:52] he talked to the head of the house
[1:19:54] the Lord sent and Abraham wherefore did
[1:19:57] Sarah laugh saying I shall of surety
[1:19:59] bear child which I'm oh is anything too
[1:20:04] hard for the El capital lort
[1:20:08] huh
[1:20:10] there anything too hard for the Lord at
[1:20:13] the time appointed I
[1:20:17] am will return unto the according to the
[1:20:22] time well that's why Jesus could stand
[1:20:23] there and I love that scripture where
[1:20:24] they're yakking about and I say yeah Kim
[1:20:27] the Pharisees is always yakking about
[1:20:28] something kinda like the press the press
[1:20:31] does brother brother Trump you know just
[1:20:34] aggravates him to death and you know
[1:20:36] what they just full of lives and
[1:20:38] everything else but here's Sarah and all
[1:20:41] these different things and here's
[1:20:43] Abraham's going man the promise this to
[1:20:45] me he really believed that that promise
[1:20:48] was his
[1:20:50] he put everything out of the way
[1:20:53] everything out of the way and here
[1:20:55] stands Abraham and here stands Sarah
[1:20:58] alright at the time appointed I will now
[1:21:04] there was a Pharisees and what did I say
[1:21:05] Jesus Jesus said
[1:21:07] they said we'd be the seed of Abraham
[1:21:10] he said before Abraham was
[1:21:14] he was standing right there don't tell
[1:21:17] me that Jesus it wasn't standing on the
[1:21:19] shores of Galilee speaking that was not
[1:21:21] that same guy that stood right there
[1:21:23] that's wanka said before Abraham was I
[1:21:25] am and then those carnal Pharisees what
[1:21:27] next day well you don't even look 50
[1:21:29] years old well they were that was really
[1:21:31] completely a little bit dumb that was
[1:21:33] like four thousand years ago
[1:21:35] right I mean they see you don't even
[1:21:37] look fifty years old
[1:21:39] well from the time he was standing there
[1:21:41] to this happening around here was about
[1:21:43] four thousand years or at least 2,000
[1:21:45] years
[1:21:46] you know even fifty years old just
[1:21:49] that's the devil for you picks and picks
[1:21:51] and picks at the time appointed I will
[1:21:54] return in other words Abraham I'm going
[1:21:57] to handle it
[1:21:58] when you listen when you get the new
[1:22:00] birth
[1:22:01] you ought to be the most settled person
[1:22:04] inside
[1:22:07] you should be the most now you're gonna
[1:22:10] have turmoil with the outside guy and
[1:22:13] the middle guy and the bills and the
[1:22:15] wife and the kids and the husband the
[1:22:18] wife and you understand what I mean but
[1:22:21] inside of the inside
[1:22:23] brother dick didn't have a struggle with
[1:22:26] leaving this world
[1:22:27] hmm no no you should not have a struggle
[1:22:33] if you know that you know that you know
[1:22:36] listen Abraham didn't struggle at all
[1:22:38] because God is telling him look he's
[1:22:40] believing what this man God is telling
[1:22:43] him at the time of point I will return
[1:22:46] unto thee in other words I'm the one I'm
[1:22:50] gonna change your body you can't do it
[1:22:54] according to the time of life and Sarah
[1:22:56] she'll have a son then Sarah denied
[1:22:58] saying I laughed not for she was afraid
[1:22:59] he said nay but thou did laugh in other
[1:23:02] words brother Branham said if it wasn't
[1:23:03] for Abraham God would have killed Sarah
[1:23:05] coach Sarah was calling God a liar and
[1:23:08] that's kind of hard you know that's our
[1:23:10] weakness we do that but you know what
[1:23:12] we've got headship we've got Jesus
[1:23:15] Christ our advocate we've got Jesus
[1:23:16] Christ our attorney we've got Jesus
[1:23:18] Christ our he's our judge he's our jury
[1:23:21] he he's our advocate our high priest to
[1:23:24] stand between when we make mistakes like
[1:23:26] that and Sarah denied and said I'll
[1:23:29] laugh not okay and the men rose up from
[1:23:31] this and looked toward Sodom see now
[1:23:33] they look towards Sodom and Abraham went
[1:23:35] with them to bring them on the way and
[1:23:37] the Lord said shall I hide anything from
[1:23:39] Abraham that thing which I do look
[1:23:42] here's the scripture right here seeing
[1:23:44] that Abraham says surely become a great
[1:23:47] and mighty nation now he didn't promise
[1:23:49] he miss before he promised him he was
[1:23:51] going to give him that but he's telling
[1:23:54] him exactly not Abram Abraham
[1:23:58] seeing that Abraham shall surely become
[1:24:01] a great and mighty nation and all the
[1:24:04] nations of the earth shall be blessed in
[1:24:06] him for I know him
[1:24:11] Wow for I know him that he will command
[1:24:16] his children and his household after him
[1:24:20] and they shall keep the way of the Lord
[1:24:24] to do justice and judgment that the Lord
[1:24:27] may bring upon who Abraham that which he
[1:24:31] has spoken of him
[1:24:34] he was telling Abraham I am giving you
[1:24:38] this promise because you're gonna take
[1:24:41] this and you're going to not just tell
[1:24:43] your people you're gonna live it
[1:24:46] you're gonna live it you're gonna live
[1:24:50] it in front of your kids and your kids
[1:24:51] are gonna live it in front of their kids
[1:24:53] and their kids because there comes Isaac
[1:24:55] and Jacob and Joseph and and all the
[1:24:57] different ones coming out of Abraham
[1:24:59] right coming out of that lineage of
[1:25:02] Abraham and the Lord said because the
[1:25:04] cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and
[1:25:06] because their sin is very Grievous I
[1:25:08] will go down now and see whether they
[1:25:10] have done altogether according to the
[1:25:11] cry of it which is coming to me and if
[1:25:13] not I will know and the men turned their
[1:25:16] faces from thence and went toward Sodom
[1:25:18] but Abraham stood yet before the Lord in
[1:25:20] other words like brother Aaron said they
[1:25:21] went to Sodom but God stayed with
[1:25:24] Abraham the promised seed because he was
[1:25:26] going to stay there with the promise
[1:25:28] now not to say those are not promises
[1:25:30] down there in the world but this is his
[1:25:33] seat this is his lineage this is the
[1:25:36] lineage of God and man
[1:25:39] spiritually not naturally now not seeds
[1:25:42] as of many
[1:25:43] because there stands Christ
[1:25:46] telling Abraham I'm going you're gonna
[1:25:50] have a promise child and he's gonna be
[1:25:51] named izing you're gonna have these but
[1:25:53] what was he saying in the love letter in
[1:25:57] the love letter he was saying exactly
[1:25:59] what he said there in Romans
[1:26:01] through Paul or Ephesians that it's one
[1:26:06] seed which is me now cuz he would have
[1:26:09] said if if Abraham could have swallowed
[1:26:12] that he said look Abraham I
[1:26:16] got some kids on there aligned some
[1:26:19] spiritual children and they got to act
[1:26:22] like you you're a wonderful example in I
[1:26:25] know you're gonna take your example and
[1:26:26] you're gonna go through generation he
[1:26:28] said but also my spiritual seed he's
[1:26:30] gonna go through generation to
[1:26:32] generation to generation come down to
[1:26:35] the end time
[1:26:36] seven church ages
[1:26:39] one on the day of Pentecost
[1:26:43] 123,000 and he says I know my seed one
[1:26:47] seat not meaning one seat when 120 got
[1:26:50] born again they got born again by one
[1:26:52] seed
[1:26:53] they had faith
[1:26:56] let's here we go
[1:26:58] but look at Abraham let's just do this
[1:27:00] real quick we're not gonna get to
[1:27:01] chapter 20 so we'll just stop right here
[1:27:03] but watch what Abraham did now watch
[1:27:05] Abraham says look God if they's fifty
[1:27:08] righteous will you not destroy the city
[1:27:10] I love those people I
[1:27:13] love those people I don't think you know
[1:27:15] like say about this world there's
[1:27:18] thousands of people dying not just of
[1:27:20] this coronavirus but everything else
[1:27:22] because of diseases and Abraham said
[1:27:27] fifty you know what God said and he said
[1:27:30] okay if you find fine fifty I'll not go
[1:27:34] down there and destroy in other words
[1:27:37] Abraham was typing the same thing Moses
[1:27:39] was when Moses stood in the gap brother
[1:27:41] branham said for the people and said God
[1:27:43] if you kill them you gonna have to kill
[1:27:45] me first he said you got to kill me
[1:27:47] first you know what Moses was saying
[1:27:50] Moses was literally saying God if you're
[1:27:52] gonna get to them people you got to go
[1:27:54] through me first and Bret brother Brian
[1:27:56] said that what Moses that was the Spirit
[1:27:58] of Christ in Moses so there's the Spirit
[1:28:01] of Christ in Abraham that it's saying
[1:28:04] God if you find 50 he said okay that'd
[1:28:07] be far from thee to do after this manner
[1:28:09] to slay the righteous with the wicked
[1:28:10] now because remember a lot was the Bible
[1:28:13] says it makes his righteous soul brother
[1:28:15] Aaron said he was like to the foolish
[1:28:17] virgin and the different ones they would
[1:28:18] be given eternal life that the righteous
[1:28:21] should be as the wicked that be far from
[1:28:22] thee shall not the judge of all the
[1:28:24] earth do right now look the judge
[1:28:25] capital he's he's acknowledging that's
[1:28:29] God standing there
[1:28:31] shall not the judge of all the earth do
[1:28:35] right
[1:28:35] Omaha same thing Moses said you know
[1:28:39] what Moses said to God one time he said
[1:28:42] God if you kill all these people he said
[1:28:44] it's going to be known that you took him
[1:28:46] out of he's ain't gotten you that but he
[1:28:50] wanted Moses to know that God honored
[1:28:53] what he said
[1:28:54] cuz he said God if you do that said hey
[1:28:57] yeah that's great God and if you kill
[1:29:00] all them people they gonna talk about
[1:29:02] you Raja what he said right but God knew
[1:29:06] what he was gonna say and God was going
[1:29:07] that's my boy shall not the judge of all
[1:29:11] the earth do right and the Lord said if
[1:29:13] I find in Sodom 50 then I'll spare the
[1:29:16] whole place and Abram answered and said
[1:29:18] I better lower that number a little bit
[1:29:20] we all now I've taken upon me to
[1:29:22] speaking to the Lord
[1:29:24] look what he's saying which I am but
[1:29:26] dust and ashes he's not puffing his
[1:29:29] shoulders out and saying God you going
[1:29:31] to do what I said you need to listen to
[1:29:32] me no he said Lord I'm ashes just like
[1:29:35] them people down there at you pre
[1:29:37] adventure that's y'all act 5 of the 50
[1:29:39] righteous will tout destroy all the city
[1:29:42] for lack of 5 he said if I find their 40
[1:29:45] and 5 I will not destroy him he's
[1:29:47] speaking to him yet and said pre
[1:29:49] adventure there shall be 40 found there
[1:29:51] and he said I will do not for 40 thing
[1:29:53] and he sent him old let not the Lord be
[1:29:56] angry and I will speak pre adventure
[1:29:58] that she'll be 30 and he keeps going on
[1:30:00] but watch what he gets down to him it's
[1:30:03] a little bit he goes down to 20 now when
[1:30:07] he gets down to 32 and he says oh let
[1:30:08] not the Lord be angry and I will speak
[1:30:11] yet but this one's pre Adventure 10
[1:30:14] she'll be found he said I'll not destroy
[1:30:16] it 14 and the Lord went his way as soon
[1:30:18] as he had left communing with Abram
[1:30:20] Abraham and Abraham returned into his
[1:30:23] place do you know how many you know do
[1:30:25] you know I believe if Abraham would have
[1:30:27] said four
[1:30:30] God want her destroyed Sodom and
[1:30:32] Gomorrah
[1:30:35] you explained it he kept going down from
[1:30:39] 50 to 40 to 30 to 20 if he had to say
[1:30:41] god if you'd find 4 because he found
[1:30:44] light his wife and the two daughters
[1:30:46] that was 4 but he didn't he didn't go
[1:30:49] that far Cody knew they were gonna have
[1:30:51] to be destroyed but then we know what
[1:30:53] the angels did let's stop right there
[1:30:55] y'all come on musicians
[1:30:57] we know what the two angels did they
[1:31:00] went to Sodom and they called out light
[1:31:02] and when light saw him he said my Lords
[1:31:06] he didn't have a revelation of one true
[1:31:09] and living God
[1:31:12] but Sunday we'll we'll get on the
[1:31:15] Genesis chapter 20 I hope you've kind of
[1:31:19] enjoyed this a little bit I've enjoyed
[1:31:20] it because even walking right walking
[1:31:22] through Abraham's life again but let's
[1:31:25] get into let's get in - lets get into
[1:31:27] Ruth a little bit let's see what Ruth
[1:31:29] Ruth is basically going through the same
[1:31:31] thing that Abram went through to Abraham
[1:31:34] because like brother Dale said it it
[1:31:37] really wasn't Ruth wasn't connected
[1:31:41] Ruth had no connection to what but to
[1:31:44] bow ass
[1:31:47] zero-zero
[1:31:49] she was a daughter-in-law of the sons
[1:31:53] that died but he was Ken - Naomi which
[1:31:59] is the old Jewish that's what he started
[1:32:02] with to bring them through Israel and to
[1:32:04] show us all the examples
[1:32:06] but when he got Ruth they had a promise
[1:32:10] son - just like Abraham and Sarah had a
[1:32:13] promise son so dear Ruth and Boaz have a
[1:32:15] promise son let's sing a song god bless
[1:32:17] you

[1:33:34] talks to me
[1:33:35] some 20 years behind me and the
[1:33:40] melody that he gave to me
[1:33:45] within
[1:33:47] my heart is ringing
[1:33:53] and
[1:33:55] he walks with me and he talks with me
[1:34:02] and he tells me I am his own
[1:34:10] and the joy
[1:34:12] we share as

[1:34:22] known
[1:34:25] oh

[1:34:31] [Applause]
[1:34:33] the overnight
[1:34:36] around me be
[1:34:39] falling bunny bids me go through the
[1:34:46] voice song
[1:34:48] his voices to me is
[1:34:54] calling
[1:34:57] and he won't think about that me and he
[1:35:03] talks with me and he tells me I am his
[1:35:10] own
[1:35:12] and the joy we share as
[1:35:17] we tarry
[1:35:19] them no no
[1:35:23] has ever
[1:35:27] you know abraham really enjoyed that
[1:35:29] whole day of communion with milk
[1:35:31] hesitant
[1:35:32] and he may not have totally understood
[1:35:35] exactly everything
[1:35:38] but
[1:35:40] the next morning or the next before the
[1:35:42] next 28 days something happened
[1:35:45] they woke up and looked at each other
[1:35:47] and sitting kidness
[1:35:49] Sarah you gotta look this way in 80
[1:35:52] years
[1:35:52] Abraham you haven't looked this way in
[1:35:54] 80 something here
[1:35:56] you know what Abraham said
[1:35:59] the promise Sarah the promise it's here
[1:36:05] it's here the promise is now ready to be
[1:36:08] fulfilled same way with you and I we're
[1:36:11] heading toward that body change we're
[1:36:13] coming to it coming to it coming to it
[1:36:14] we're realizing that God's ever closer
[1:36:17] to the promise that he promised us that
[1:36:19] we would take a body change
[1:36:21] promise that the dead Saints would walk
[1:36:24] back into the building those people that
[1:36:25] are downstairs and the ones that we've
[1:36:27] seen go on over in another dimension
[1:36:29] never to see them old again they went
[1:36:31] through that filter
[1:36:32] they went to that filter and left the
[1:36:34] old here and took the new over there on
[1:36:37] the other side never seen Mary hall in a
[1:36:39] hospital with a bad heart no not anymore
[1:36:44] where see a young girl with that poorly
[1:36:47] hair with a little with a little ribbons

[1:36:51] to folks it's not a promise it's a
[1:36:53] reality because prop Abraham said God

[1:36:59] next morning and they were both chains
