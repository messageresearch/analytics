========================================

uh this morning I got up took my blood pressure and it was 129 I think something like that that's the lowest it's been in the morning a long time needless to say I wish that blood pressure pill was back in that in that bottle so this morning and I made this statement too is around here we must be doing something right because I'll tell you what old Satan is really uh doing the work and so we're going to uh read from psalm 6. this morning we'll read all 10 verses y'all pray for me that this father we just praise you and we thank you for this time set aside this morning we can gather in lift up and glorify your name we just praise you in every way father that should be with this word it would read it might come and attach yourself to us father we might be able to Manifest this in our lives and we just praise Johnny be with those not here watch over be with brother Cauley there whatever his situation is father just touch him in a special way in Jesus name we're praying for his sake amen amen first verse Oh Lord rebuke me not in thine anger neither chasten me in thy displeasure High displeasure my soul is also Soul waxed but thou O Lord how long for in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who shall give thee thanks mine is consumed because of grief it waxed old because all mine enemies the Lord has heard my supplication the Lord will receive my prayer let them return and be ashamed suddenly stand not just my physical sight but by spiritual Insight we're able to see him the world will see him no more but you and I are going to see him because he'll be with us and even in us to the end of the world good to be in the house of the Lord again amen thanks for all the prayers and a week from Wednesday we'll be leaving for the Philippines for three weeks so we'll uh we'll be uh don't you get too comfortable sitting over here we'll be uh we'll be uh leaving for three weeks so just keep us in your prayer and uh those will go with me the prayers are the Saints but thank you for the uh for the offering it'll be used I won't be working for those three weeks so we we may use a little bit of that to pay some bills with but still the Lord knows all things he's going to take care of it all I am not worried one bit I am not worried I really am not worried a bit but I want to thank we're is hoping here hope Rebecca Sterling uh sister Trudy Mack where's Regina who else Mr John where's she at sister Johnny last night they did a wonderful job at the sweethearts banquet they came and helped that was one of the best ones we had a good time putting it up we had a good time taking it down and had a good time in between but a good time in the Lord I think I think Sister Christine found out that we were pretty crazy in the west I was surprised to see them back today you get into you get into asking questions in like a Newlywed Game you know you remember those from the old TV program The Newlywed Game we we always have fun with that and you kind of get uh you kind of get to know each other you kind of figure out too that the wives don't know much about the husbands and the husbands don't know much about the wives but some were in there the ones that won last night was brother Joe and sister Gwen they just beat everybody so bless their heart Terence and Lisa were second and uh sometimes the one you think that you know maybe not is going to do it will do it brother Tony and sister Esther won last year so uh we just you know what we're still human we still live in human life we still God gave us a mate and you're supposed to honor her right and you know what honor in a Christian way I looked at brother Louise last night and I said we're having all this fun and no alcohol involved we're having all this fun kids the greatest fun you'll ever have is with Christian people right you might think you'll have fun with them people out there in the world but no no no no no no it'll be for a fleeting moment only but this will endure forever this will take right over into eternity and have a good time with that so I want to thank also my mother for putting this together and I want to thank brother Dale too for paying for it because we have been to several that you have to pay a fee to go to which is fine I mean that's okay but but this church covers all expenses and everything's paid and actually we give out gifts and uh and prizes and things to uh to kind of help you along so so just Pat brother Dale on the back in sisterdale because they're the ones that's giving the time and the money for us to have a little bit of fun while we're still here on this Earth so and I believe like I said it'll carry on into eternity so let's turn to our Bibles to Second Peter chapter one and we're gonna we're gonna continue today we're going to try to get uh to the Holy Spirit today or get it finished and then start this afternoon on charity or love and go right into adoption which is a favorite subject of mine I I've been speaking several places I was at brother Joe Greene's last week and we spoke on the call to adoption so it was just kind of a uh a light version of what you know we would get here but but that is our call our call is to adoption it's not just to be good Christians there were good Christians all down through time but it's time for us to come up higher and the prophet of God said we can if you want to come up higher in God where that God doesn't have to treat you like a baby all the time where you can be a full-grown adult and God and God can use you any way he wants to and there's one thing for sure he will never use you wrong right all right so we depend on that and that's where we put our faith and our belief known that God will not do anything to harm you if anybody harms you you know who that is that's the Devil Himself so II Peter chapter one verse one and let's bow our head good to see our our friends with us they've been here before so good to see you again good good to be in the house of the Lord with you and the little brother back there with with Sterling good to see you you've been here before no well you're in for a treat and look oh hey sister well Lord bless you good to have you with us would you pick her on side of the road no oh wonderful that's good well good to see you good to have you here let's bow our hands before we get started Heavenly Father we pray Lord today that you come Among Us in a special way father not as we say being a bystander to record our thoughts and ideas but be an active participant in this service you do the speaking you do the hearing you do the revealing father because there's no way that a human will be able to do those things father we pray that you just be with the ones that are not here Lord we have a full house today but there are a few out that are sick we actually just bless them now Lord just in the name of Jesus Christ go and heal them now father one's Lord that are sin sick that we we stand every day I don't know the people on the internet know it or the people here sometimes realize that right under my feet is a group of names on a board and its family members Lord the ones that we've posted to keep us you said to continually to remember these things and we put their name up and they're right here under this sacred Pulpit Lord and Lord we pray that as we speak father that the Holy Spirit would go to that group of people and save their soul father bless them and take them Lord and and just stir their water so much to where they won't care about this life out there Lord but they'll want to have a life in Jesus Christ father just bless us Lord take care of us during this journey that we have we were the ones Lord that are on the foreign Mission fields that you'll bless them and give them fruit for their labor father just be with us Lord take care of us today forgive us of our sins in Jesus name amen also remembers brother Dale said Remember the the Dale and Sims family in the passing of the of dad's sister she was real sweet lady but uh we know how God gives rewards so we are like I said before we you look into life and the life lives she lived a good as much as she knew a nominal Christian life since Merle lived a good life so but now we are going to come into here and we're going to try to raise that bar up a little bit because God said we could all right Simon Peter servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained so they have to go get it like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God In Our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power so there's no demon power there it's divine Powers the power of God Amen hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness so we've been on this series now for seven or eight or nine services on how to live your life and live it Godly all right through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue we're by our given so these are gifts and they're given to us whereby are given unto us you know what though remember a pardon is not a pardon unless what it's accepted as a pardon the pardon's there but the man had to accept the pardon so you must accept these gifts God's not going to give you these gifts just because you're a good person he's not going to give you these gifts because you just in the message right whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these prophet of God said these promises ye might be partakers of the divine nature now that's not your nature that's the divine nature of God having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this so okay besides this do what giving all diligence right add to your faith virtue into verse of knowledge and all these temperaments Temperance patience patience godliness godliness brotherly kindness the brotherly kindness charity for if there's that big word if if these things be in you not on you these are not anointings right these are actual working gifts all right we'll talk about that a little bit when we get up to the holy spirit for if these things be in you and abound they got to be overflowing they make you it's going to turn you from that Old nature make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ who wouldn't want that neither Barry nor in fruitful but he that liketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off what rather cannot see Revelation and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence look at all these adjectives give diligence to make your pastors calling that's not what it says to make your calling an election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall right you may be seated in the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word I love that reading it never gets old to read that even though we've read it seven or eight times and about two years down in the Sunday school class but uh we want to today to kind of uh since we didn't do anything like you you know last Sunday uh brother Dale brought two wonderful messages there that um that would uh help you if you'd listen all right Ephesians 4 let's continue reading on because remembering this is just kind of background for the ones that have not been here what happens in second Peter Peter picks up the revelation of God right he picks up the revelation of God and he says okay we need these things Faith version always implications but he doesn't really tell you how to get them he just gets you on the road that you got to know you have to have a knowledge that you need them then Peter picks up the rebel yeah Paul picks up the Revelation and it tells you how to get them right all right so now here we go Ephesians 4 11 and he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers so that's the only way you're going to get it for the perfecting of the Saints all the way up for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ what tell so there's a journey till till we all come into Unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ which is all the way up there at The Headstone amen so Peter tells you what you need Paul tells you how to get it all right so see God has God has equipped this brother Louise he told us what we need and how to get it so what else do we need we need to get under this five-fold ministry that's a true faithful Ministry all right amen because there's some foals out there that's not that's not true but a true Firefall ministry will point you straight to Christ amen all right so now we go to the first quote that we've read every day every time and we're going to read it again brother Brown says notice you must be born again not up here we're going to talk about that today what this holy spirit is but you got to be born again right here at what faith right right notice you must be born again you can't have these Godly virtues unless God's in you to activate them amen amen all right and when you're born again you can't be born again without having Faith that's right down there so you see on my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of all of it all right but remember and I didn't bring that quote but remember the other quote brother Brown said faith alone won't do it right so faith alone is not going to do it all now scroll it all the way up you're possessed of one that dominates your life which you see it said that's either Faith or doubt so in your soul today in your soul we're talking to the soul of man in your soul today if you're born again it's faith if you're not born again it's doubt it's not faith and doubt it's Faith or doubt all right so there's not two people in your soul for the two Soul people went wrong you were born a living soul born in sin shaping iniquity a spouse from your mother's womb a liar brother Brown said doomed and on your way to hell right right then God comes in and burns that old nature of that soul out puts his soul in and then what it's you and God in there as persons right brother Brown said you in Christ in there as persons but you're possessed of one that dominates your life come on there's the control tower not up here down here right right just depends on how much faith you have how high you can rise all right so it's going to be left up to you you can't come you can't come even as a Christian you can't come up to God one day and say God why didn't you give me Temperance you know what he's going to say you didn't want it how much faith is how high you can rise and God has given us an ability to rise all the way up to the Capstone which is love amen all right so now can you bring up the chart um Brother Anderson to start with there you go now this is the full chart so let's just leave it right there for a little while because we're going to go through them real quick but you must be what Justified and Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost to get in this it's not a pyramid teaching but brother Branham used that pyramid as a as a symbol of showing like brother um Joe and I were talking you go over and remember at the very first we read about zerubbable oh thou great Mountain right zerubbable and a mountain that mountain will be a plane it'll start and grow and then The Headstone comes down crying Grace great but the only way to get into that is to what be justified by faith Sanctified by faith and then that faith God honors your faith by bringing the his life into your life is that all right say amen amen that's the way it is you can't come you can't go up here and then try to get down here you can't build that you must build through justification out of court sanctification inner court but the holy of holies is right here that's where God resides is the holy of holies you can have a lot of you can have some of these part of these and be just Sanctified sure but to have virtue Faith you got to have faith first right amen to have knowledge Faith you got to have what faith first Faith got to have faith faith is the whole Foundation now the word faith we looked at in the Greek and we're going to just go through this real quick but everybody see that that was a faith that's the new birth that's the Holy Ghost that's where you start you you cannot start with these virtues without being born again amen the Holy Spirit at the top I'll explain that this that today if the Lord willing all right but the word faith means Assurance or belief you must believe in something remember none of us saw Jesus die on the cross physically right but we must believe that he did and it becomes so much of a belief that we know that he did amen amen so then we accept what he did for us not what we do now what we do is later on works is Faith expressed right all right so we but we must come to a belief first so faith is believing you got to have faith in something amen the whole song You must believe in something or you'll fall for anything and that's what the problem is you got but what you how are you going to believe a five-fold ministry's got to bring you the word of God so you can learn how to believe because we believed in everything else we believed in this and that and the other but when we come and bring a five-fold Ministry that brings the word of God you say God I believe in that you know what he honors that he has to honor his own word hey man then our works then our works is our faith expressed right all right because you can't you can have a whole lot of work but I told you many times before if you look over there in Revelations the ones that are going to be judged they're judged by their works right I don't want to be judged by one work I do right right I want to be judged by The Works that Christ did and that way he's the perfect one so you and I are the perfect one in him amen we're not perfect in ourselves but we're perfect in him that's why we stand in judgment judging because we he took our sins and we accept that right but the ones that come up to the white Throne judgment that don't receive the new birth they have to be judged by The Works they did on the earth and I'm telling you I don't want to be judged by even coming to church and living a good life right amen right so faith is belief now let's go to Virtue now we looked up the word Virtue and we'll not go into the scriptures and will not read what brother random said because we've already done that several times but what did we find out virtue was strength all right it's strength it's power It's ability it's inherent power power residing In A Thing by virtue of its nature or which a person or thing exerts or puts for it Peter didn't have to go call another preacher Peter didn't have to go call the prophet he didn't have to go find Jesus Jesus was in him he said Silver and Gold Have by none but such as I have give I unto thee the power was residing in a Thing Called Peter amen you saw that was for Peter no that was for you amen because we can't have just Faith now we must have strength or a strong faith all right faith alone won't do it you must rise higher and have a strong faith so what so that that virtue or that strength can go out to other people amen now let's go to knowledge knowledge signifies in general intelligence understanding the general knowledge of Christian religion the deeper are more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion such as belong to the more advanced now see you went from Faith to Virtue or knowledge you're what you're advancing amen all right you're advancing belongs to the more advanced especially of things lawful and unlawful for Christians now what do we talk about what is discernment right things lawful and unlawful you're judging right now today you're judging whether I'm telling you the truth or not right all right so discernment we saw was a requirement of a Christian you're required to discern every day of your life right all right now when you were out in the world yeah sure you discern things you know you might want to kill that guy but you don't that's just a moral obligation of not killing another man but now you will come up a little higher come up a little higher in the word and Jesus said if you say one word against that person you're killing that influence of that person you've killed that person the prophet of God said same way with with uh you know we used to get away with looking at a woman in lust and after him Jesus said ah you can't get away with that no more because see the Pharisees could say look I've never touched a woman before physically Jesus knew though in their mind that they undress those women all the time because that's what he told him he said now if you look on a woman to lust after you've committed adultery so we're looking at lawful and unlawful for Christians all right that's why the Bible says don't take a Christian to court right judge right here this is where the judgment is right here don't take a Christian to court all right now don't let the people in the world run all over you okay but I'm talking about Christian versus Christians you should never take a Christian to court you should settle it what by the word of God moral wisdom such as seeing and right living but we looked at discernment so now we look at we have we have faith we have virtue faith strong faith now we must have discernment faith okay to discern right from wrong and then we looked at spiritual Insight so you've got to have not just not just that I can do calculus knowledge that I can take Matthew 28 19 and Acts 2 38 and see that they say the exact same thing amen that it's not two different things it's the exact see that to me that spiritual discernment but see spiritual discernment has been lost down Through the Ages by Creeds and dogmas and they said no that's not this is the way you do it and this is not so they've lost that spiritual discernment but God never lost his spiritual discernment the people just lost it because of what teaching the teaching of the people in the church ages down to not not the Christians but the ones that's made denominations set barriers right and they discerned wrong they did not have spiritual insight and brother Branham told us in the church age book that we must be Spirit have spiritual Insight in the end time or we'll get caught with some of these doctrines all right so now knowledge is discernment Faith all right now temperance we looked at the word Temperance and we all talked about Temperance being temper and things like that but for the ones that have not been here it is how to control your ungodly temper but it's also self-control of everything all right all right so it's a controlled faith Jesus had a control faith says the virtue of one who Masters his desires and passions especially essential appetite mastering controlling curbing restraining controlling oneself temperate our continent that means control everything control your tongue control all the things that you have around you but Jesus one time I I look at it like like that is when when Jesus was laying asleep in the boat and the you know all heck was breaking Loops outside there was uh uh the disciples were actually saying how can you sleep when this is going on well he had so much of a controlled Faith to all he done he got up and he said where's your faith he said peace be still he would come up to a demon and a demon would come and a demon would actually speak back and said thou Son of God there was so much of a controlled Faith there until Jesus didn't need to call he had that control faith you look at brother Branham when he walks in he says look I take every Spirit under my control see he was using that Temperance faith that he had he was using that controlling faith not to control you as mind over matter there's no way for God God doesn't do that that's the devil right right so that's what the devil tries to do the devil tries to get in there and control you but look it says self-control so it's got to come from what South all right self-control which is a controlled faith that all these things we were talking about um I was talking about in The Prayer you know you got downstairs we've got the wall with all of our children and our husbands and wives and all that are that are down under my feet here in the Sunday school class they're all looking for you to be in control see once you get out of control that's the first thing they're going to look at you start popping off at the lip and you start doing all these things all right kids are going to look at that and going to say wow do I want what he's got it okay right as for all others comes from up here back there we all need that self-control that look God you said it I believe it and let's just walk into it all right amen because that's what we got to do because if we look if Abraham looked at his circumstance he could have never produced that child but he came to a place he said God I can't do it you're gonna have to do it for me amen so controlled faith sure we have need to control our temper God is the only one who can do that because see we're fighting against that old nature the old nature is being we're fighting against it in all these we're fighting against all the uh the natural things of the world but God listen God has given us provision these promises told us how to what to get and how to get it so it's left up to me and you to say God I want you to control my temper I want you to control my whatever it's a controlled faith brother Branham you know the maniac comes running up the the aisle you know and a huge man and he says 200 preachers just left the pulpit they didn't have a lot of control but one man stood there and he said something came from what inside I was reading it the other day something came from here and he said you'll fall at my feet and still the demon said no I'm gonna I'm gonna break you in half and throw you off this pulpit and he said you'll fall at my feet well see that's a controlled temperate faith and that's what you and I must have because listen it's not going to get any easier the devil's going to get closer and closer and closer and closer and we're gonna have to have that controlled Faith to not be so out of control that's a good one all right you got to have control faith right now let's go to patience we saw patience with steadfastness constancy endurance all right in the New Testament the characteristics of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to Faith you never lose that so we're looking at patience faith our enduring faith our perseverant faith which is what the greatest trials in South piety by even the greatest trials and suffering because remember the Bible says the trial of your faith is more precious than gold and you're going to be tried tribulation I didn't put this in here but remember tribulation worketh what patience so you are going to have right here you're going to have to go through some tribulation remember this is not spoons and forks this is knives and swords and man we're not going to do it in a picnic it's going to be a bottle that we got to go through so you got to go through a battle but remember you must have endurance Paul said I come to the end of my road I run my I run my race and a Crown of Life Waits on me he knew he had patience and look the first thing brother Brown said do what have patience with who God right amen that God would do what he said he would do and then next have patience with the people all right but steadfastness now let's go to Godliness we spoke on Garland this couple of Sundays ago excuse me we saw that it was reverence respect piety towards God and remember what we talked about we talked about in godliness we talked about what respect respect for the gifts of God all right because you got to be Godly down here because you're talking about life and godliness you got to start acting like God once God comes in you all right but when you come here you have respect for what God give you to me that's to me that's a revelation it's respect for the gifts of God and you know what it's a respect for the gift that God gave you remember power without character is satanic that's right but Power with character is spit to rule now who you got to rule first you got to rule this first amen if you don't rule this first you forget about everything else right right all right so now let's go to uh the quote there number two and let's just we're going to background a little bit more with godliness umbrella kindness because we kind of flew through them last Sunday or Sunday two weeks ago fifth so my godliness to be added what does godliness mean I looked four or five dictionaries and couldn't even find what it meant finally I was down at brother Jeffrey's there we found it in her dictionary godliness means to be like God right all right oh my after you get Faith virtue and all his temper's patience then be like God he says sure you say I can't do that brother Branham this is the prophet we we we we he said right right I mean he wasn't wrong right he was sent to tell us what God Said right read that with me oh yes you can I don't need to read no more oh guess oh yes you can you know why because that Prophet was the mouthpiece of God he caught the mind of God and you know who said that God said that through a prophet I can't do that brother Brown oh yes you can right right then he talks about the scriptures what he goes right back to be therefore perfect and then he goes to what we read in Ephesians where Apostles prophets pastors teaches evangelists you get way up here now before you're asked to do that see you're not asked to have respect for the gift or to act Godly until you get way up there you get way up here before you're asked to do that all these things has to be added first right then when you get up here he asks you now to be perfect godliness Sons and Daughters of God then how many things he could say about on that line and we'll leave it there because it's a respect it's a respect knowing that God look when you get right here look what God's packed into you already right look what should be working in your life and what God has what he has he has said you're able to do these things and I'm going to give them to you because I know what you'll do with them when I give them to you right see this is why you get right here and you say well what that's respect for the gifts that God's already give you right you got that say amen that's the that's that's look what a what a wonderful God that gives us a new birth but he wants us to do more he doesn't want us to stay babies he wants us to be somebody that can respect the gifts of God and respect what God has already give you and you know what it doesn't put you up here if it does you're not down there if it puts you swells your head up you're not up here you're going to you need to go right back down here and get some of this then you're going to have respect or or be humble that God would even give you these things but you know what brother dick if God give them to you he know what you'll do with them right so if he's give those gifts to you and God said look you've got temperance and you realize you got Temperance you thank God that God was that God was had enough to give you that gift and then you in return you just let them work you're you're the vessel to let them work okay God doesn't want you to keep all these things inside right virtue goes out knowledge goes out ten percent patience that's something we got to work on godliness is something we got to work on probably kind of something we got to work on so he starts out with you able to give these things out but these things up to here you work in here and then watch what's going to happen up here when we get up to where God can really use you as a as a true vessel of God Amen not that you're not a true vessel down here remember those words true and and is not like true versus false because you're going to read in here we're going to read brother Brown said the true baptism of the Holy Ghost comes on you right there that doesn't mean you receive the false New Birth because remember in Revelation 3 14 says the faithful and true witness now there never was a time that Jesus Christ was wrong and had to be true so he's the faithful and true witness in other words it ring everything Rings just right yeah yeah all right because remember you're faithful and true witness here but my what God wants to do for you man I said before I I love our little children like they are but but God forbid if I want them to stay that way that's not God's plan it's for you to be is to stay a child they're cute and beautiful but God wants you to grow up into God hey man so now brotherly kindness the godliness remember what we said godliness was was what respect respect for the gift of God now brotherly kindness let's read a couple of scriptures here because like I said we wanted to get to get a little bit of this because I want you I want you to see something today uh that that was in the back that I kind of wanted to I didn't know how to go last week but or now I kind of know how to go let love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good Romans 12 9-10 be kindly affection one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one another all right so that that pretty much sums it up let's go to first Thessalonians which should be the next one he therefore that despises despise is not man but God remember be careful be careful ananas and Sapphira they didn't lie to Peter they lied to the Holy Ghost Peter probably had compassion for him as a human being but the Holy Ghost took over and said you lied to the Holy Ghost you didn't lie to me lie to Peter amen so you despise not man but God so like who was it that said God they've turned me down was it one of the prophets in the Old Testament uh Samuel or one of them said Lord they've turned me down he said no land turned you down he said they turned me down through you right that's why I said look right here let's go back to here respect for the gifts all right you learn to have respect for the gifts because I'm going to tell you something we can be taken off this Earth if we don't have respect for the gift of God right we can still be Christians I'm going to read you I'm going to read you something here in just a minute because I had some questions people ask me some questions about certain certain things about how to handle them and maybe we'll touch on that you know what if we don't get to it this afternoon we'll get to this afternoon uh later on but as touching brotherly love you need not that I write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another amen now let's let's look at something here that love is not filial love for those of you that don't know what filial love is feel your love is the love I have for my wife it's it's it's bordering on feelings emotions lust and all those things is that okay but agape love has nothing to do with any of that okay agape love is you love one another now it doesn't say we have to tolerate one another I'm gonna read you I'm more let's let's we'll read it that was a situation in the Bible with two Born Again Holy Ghost Phil Paul and Barnabas they had a problem for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another all right the Greek word for that though is watch it's Philadelphia but it's Brotherly Love or brother kind of so you can use both of that love of the brethren now that's not love that's what I said let's not feel your love you shouldn't have that that's what happened in the world they're having love for the Brethren out there and it's called homosexuality you see how Satan perverts it though I'm not being funny Satan perverted that he took that true love of God and now he's turned it into what the Bible says lasciviousness are men laying with men women laying with women he's turned that thing around and brought it from agape love that's what I said many times about Adam and Eve agape love had to take over Adam to not destroy Eve right I feel your love had nothing to do with that right no sex no anything like that you understand what I'm talking about the sex between Adam and Eve didn't save Eve it actually polluted her more and it polluted me and you because Adam sees what polluted the world not easy I know there's a Doctrine out there in the message that Adam had to had to have sexual relations with Eve to save her there's nothing in God of sex for salvation you can forget that Brothers I'm going to tell you something acts like brother that's like brother Joel said that's a false teaching I got enough knowledge to realize that sex don't save nothing sex is what kills us all right that's what gives us a nature I wouldn't have to preach this if all y'all was born right we wouldn't have to go to church don't get no idea but this is the love of brothers and sisters Brotherly Love in the New Testament the love which Christians cherish for each other as Brethren all right so now let's go to number three and read what brother Brandon said I will restore this is not in the Statue of perfect man this is before the statue of perfect man but watch what he says now he's talking about Pentecost was God's buying Ace talking about original Pentecost not 1906 but original Pentecost all right which was back at where in Paul's age all right now the first thing that Pentecost produced was brotherly love it tore down the middle wall of partitions and made a Brotherhood a real Brotherhood you see how Satan perverts all this he puts you into he'll put you into the Masonic Lodge or he'll put you into this or he'll put they say well it's a Brotherhood that's a Brotherhood see how Satan twists that thing and turns it around but there is a true Brotherhood in God and Sisterhood all right to such a way that they had everything in common now we're going to look at in a minute that word common is a good word to use you say well now that puts no well common does it puts everything level right because we're going to read tonight even when you start in the adoption stage that your join heirs with Christ now watch John heirs with Christ him up hearing you down here the Bible says that's not me the Bible says your Heir and join air with Jesus Christ that makes you whatever Jesus gets that's what you get amen so that brings everything in common a Brotherhood all right in the Bible days roll it all roll it up Pentecost had that I'm speaking Pentecost meaning the first group of Apostles and the disciples they had that Brotherly Love they wasn't greedy will make you greedy make you jealous right that's what brother Brown said you know somebody touch your wife and you're you're a sinner somebody touch your wife you want to kill him somebody touch your wife now as a Christian you want to pray for the man don't let him do it again but you want to pray for him pray for his bleeding pray for the broken bones and pray that he don't fall again like he fell the first time with your help but look they sold everything and for the ones of you that weren't here they sold everything they had for the white the furthermen of the church always together until even when one heard of the other one died they said let us go and die with him now that's not filial love that's agape love that takes over because look how close you are to that agape love here now remember it's all agape love all the way down amen because when you receive the new birth you receive a part of God which is agape love all right but remember we're going to read it this afternoon about in this stages of adoption your son and you're an heir but you got to grow up right amen you got to grow up let us go and die with him such a feeling so they had a common Faith or a commonness and that's the same way with brotherly kindness and there is a quote I was trying to find where brother Brown said there are some people Christians that you can't stand to be in a room with you it's just this old nature is still fighting people you're still fighting sorry it is but you must love with agape love because remember we're supposed to love the sinner but hate the sin right well when you love that sinner that's cursing you and doing all these things number one you better have some control faith to control your temper but it but if you do overcome that you look in the eyes of God God looked in the eyes of Jesus Christ and it was the same eyes right but he was looking at true human beings he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing right all right so that's what you and I must do to come to the place to where father forgive them they do not know what they're doing all right now I looked up the word common I wanted to uh to look that up and um because I wanted to find the word common if you'll pull that up we'll read it from Good Old Merriam-Webster's Dictionary belonging to or shared by two or more people or groups done by many people occurring or appearing frequently not rare I like that right occurring or appearing frequently of relating to a community at large public work for the common good known to the community belonging to or shared by two or more individuals or things are by all members of a group common friends are higher than or buried in a common grave belonging equally to two or more mathematical entities occurring or appearing it goes back again look look at this word familiar right we become familiar with who first God which is the author of Brotherly Love because he loved you when you hated him that's agape love God doesn't have feel your love it's agape love and then Satan watered it down to where it comes down to where God finally you know God God said okay you're gonna have to have feel your love because I bring you in the world now because I can't bring you here through agape love agape love is speaking the word of God Amen filio love is coming through sex desire and all those things but you know what it got you here to make a choice right so you're here to make a choice so you come to brotherly kindness and you look it says familiar a common sight listen we all have a common goal but it's like I was telling brother Joe and them last Sunday I'm not a I'm not a an evangelist I know that I don't have a pull to bring people to the altar like brother Joel Forney and some of those I don't want to be in that gift right because that's not what the way God made me he geared me to be able to I can break the word down and maybe teach the people and bring you know let let brother Louise bring him in that's why I was Illustrated let brother wait let an evangelist bring him in but somebody once you bring them in he's got to bring him up right right amen you can bring them in and be Spirit babies in Christ that's where you got to start from but somebody's got to come and then teach them the school Master brought him to Christ we'll talk about that this afternoon the school Master brought him to Christ convicted their heart brought them to the altar but somebody's got to what be a tutor and a governor to bring the people up in God because God doesn't want you to stay one more time doesn't want you to stay a baby so listen to say all all that to say this Paul and Barnabas if you'll read if you'll read about Barnabas in the book of Acts he was a man the Bible said full of the Holy Ghost going around doing signs and wonders right Paul obviously we know he was a prophet right yeah man Paul was the prophet of the church age all right look Paul also in Barnabas continued in Antioch teaching and preaching the word of the Lord with many others also and some days after Paul said unto Barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we'll preach the word of God they preached together for years three to four years they were together everywhere they went and signs and wonders followed them two Holy Ghost filled gentlemen see how and see how they do and Barnabas determined to take with him John whose surname was Mark but Paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from them from papalea and went not with them to the work and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other they didn't go together anymore they separated right and so Barnabas took Mark and sailed under Cyprus if you continue reading they still were successful okay so you can't you know even I like hunting and fishing but I I don't care much about you know flying kites or something like that so if you want to talk about flying kites I'll talk to you for a little while that's human stuff but now listen we should all they never had a contention over the word of God Paul and Peter never had a contention over the word of God Paul was telling Peter said look Peter you're not treating them people right in other words Paul was saying now Peter remember what you said Peter remember what you said because remember we have to be reminded we have to be reminded Peter had to be reminded of what position he was supposed to be in and it took a prophet to do that same thing with you and I took a prophet brother random to bring us to a place to see that we needed these and to what as we grow up through there somebody to say look you're not acting you know acting right but the contention was so sharp between them they departed so see you say well that's not brotherly kindness well obviously Paul had it okay so we can't look at brotherly kindness where we love everybody in the way we think that love should be all right there are some people you put up with there are some people that that you have differences but now look if it's ever a doctrinal difference there's a problem right right there's a doctrinal difference there's a problem right I got a problem with somebody that preaches a different Doctrine than what the pastor preaches in his church I told somebody the other day you know brother Brown said the Deacon is the policeman of the church and if a man comes in and preaches a Doctrine that's different than the doctrine of the church he's to handle it not the pastor that's what he said you're supposed to go to that person and tell them that that is not what the pastor or the teaching of this church is so we fell short as Deacon's doing that but listen but you gotta you gotta be able to discern whether that's it or not we've had you know we've had things preached in the in the Pulpit here that was that was a little bit uh off and uh you know you love the brother though you love the brother see you still can have Brotherly Love uh you know I and I want you to pray about I got a little something that that I am feeling that's going to go on in the Philippines but we'll see I've been praying about it but we'll see about how that feeling goes because some of those Brothers have preaching things in here I don't care if they know it or not they preach things in this Pulpit that's not exactly correct to the doctrine of of brother Branham so I I we may be questioned on that and we may not but we'll see but remember they may throw me off the island but I'm going to believe what I believe and I'm not saying anything against them you understand what I mean it may be that we can because one of the brothers wants to have a questions and answer session I don't know where that comes from so if he wants to have a question and answer session there must be some questions and there's got to be some answers so so we just you just pray for me that that I'll get me out that I'll leave me here and gotta go do it you know because you know me I don't have a lot of Brotherly kindness yet so I admit that I'm trying listen y'all have to tolerate me so I might as well tolerate y'all but look brotherly kindness is not not all sweetness and beautiful you understand what I'm saying this is my point it's not all uh you know roses uh because if you put your hand in a rose you can see in my hands I pruned some roses over at sister Julie's house the other day and I kind of brought some Thorns back with me so there's some thorns and among those Roses roses are pretty but and smell good but they have a few thorns in them but remember what we're supposed to do is though bottom line with brotherly kindness we're supposed to take out all the feelings we're supposed to take the lay the feelings aside that's what we're really supposed to do lay the feelings aside and love the person and I say brother but you sisters got to do the same thing right right all right your sisters we you know we you say well you've got you're supposed to do it this way or this is the right way well you know you go by the word of God because two people's not going to agree on worldly common not worldly but common things they're not going to agree that's why I said you got to have we'll come back to this you got to have common faith because common Faith brings the word of God on a level plane to everybody understand what I'm saying so brotherly kindness is not that you just see I and I don't here I go you know these people that come up so Meek and humble and you know they got their Bible like brother Branham and they sneak up on you I can't I ain't I want someone tell me what they believe and then I'll determine whether it goes through my filter or not I'll determine whether it's right or not all right all right so I like what the Bible says be bold be bold be confident that's what they said about me and brother Dale that ministers meeting they said they're they're arrogant and one brother got up and he said no they're not arrogant they're just confident there's a difference in arrogance and confidence I'm confident I was taught right so so I just have confidence that God and you know what God will back it up or he'll whip me one of the two you just leave that to God let him do it you don't have to do it he'll do it for you all right amen all right so now excuse me everybody all right with those so we got faith we got then we got virtue Faith knowledge Faith Temperance Faith because you never leave faith patience Faith godliness faith and brotherly kindness faith and we're going to look at this this evening we'll bring it all up and I want to bring all these definitions into the pyramid but let's talk about the Holy Spirit here for about 10 minutes and then we'll continue on this afternoon because we need to get out a little bit early to let brother down sister Dale eat and uh and don't worry about it we're going to have church at two o'clock we're gonna have church you can pray for brother Dale and let him you know let him go do what he needs to do with his family and and uh and the rest of us are going to have church with the church family Jesus said let the Dead bear the Dead now that's not being arrogant but your first duty is right here if you have a duty in this church if you have an office in this church this is your first Duty unless you get somebody to take your place and then you go like like Sunday school Bob asked me this morning he said well who's going to do this I said that's your problem that's yours not mine it's your problem it'll be my problem when I get back but it's his problem until I get back you got to build confidence and we all need to have confidence in that God is God never gonna he's never gonna tell you wrong and through a true faithful Ministry he's never going to tell you wrong so you must have confidence in the ability for God to send it through this got to go through this filter and then go out all right all right look but speaking the truth in love let's talk about the Holy Spirit now we're going to talk about the Holy Spirit right here just for a few minutes about 10 minutes from but speaking the truth in love May grow up into him now what's he talking about see he's continuing look for that Ephesians 4 and 12 is where we read he gave Apostles prophets Pastor teaching advantages now this is a continuation of what Paul's speaking of in the book of Ephesus now remember the Ephesians was what a very mature Church all right so they were understanding what Paul was saying but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ Now where's the head right here the head even Christ all right from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted not just put together but compacted you take that thing and you pack it down well once you pack something what happens you can't get a razor blade in between the the pyramid uh rocks over there right so same thing with God if you leave a crack and there's many quotes where brother Brown said you get up this far and you fall off why because you've left the crack somewhere and who you know who fills those cracks your friend the devil yeah from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies so it's got to come from the inside out right right according to the effectual working in the measure of every part these things are important this thing is important all these things are important all right but remember when we have brotherly kindness it puts everybody on the same level all right and the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love all right this I say therefore in testify in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having their understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through what the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over into lasciviousness is what we were just talking about a minute ago to work all uncleanliness with greediness now that ain't got nothing to do with statue of perfect man but watch but ye have not so learned Christ in other words you didn't learn this from Christ you didn't learn this from God all right if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that you put off concerning the former conversation of the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after God is what created created me a clean heart oh God which after God is created in what righteousness and true Holiness all right this is kind of long but listen wherefore putting away lying speaking every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one another be angry and sin not Paul I believe is going right through the virtues right here be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath so it's telling you how to handle temperance neither give place to the devil let him that stall still no more right that's pretty simple but very profound but rather let him labor working with his hands the things which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth in other words you're able to give right let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of Redemption all right so we can grieve it we received the new birth right here we can grieve God away in any of these virtues remember we talked about brother Brown preached doors indoors you you give your heart to God and God steps into your into your uh house but you got a door here and it's closed you got a door here and it's closed he said well God you can open that door because this one's got some dirty things in it but I cleaned this room out you know brother Brown said God was the Holy Ghost was a very tender gentleman he's not going to just bust into your door you're going to have to allow a man or not amen that's all these virtues this is look this is a door this is the door this is the door this is the door this is the door this door these are rooms in your person right right grieve not the holy spirit of God will buy you are sealed until the day of your Redemption so you're sealed down here at Faith amen please continue right let bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another brother kindness tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you I'm sure when Paul and Barnabas separated there was something in their heart that Paul probably said Lord forgive Barnabas he really didn't you know he didn't know what he was doing and I'm sure Barnabas didn't God forgive Paul or forgive me you know amen for Christ's sake has forgiven you God forgive you so you ought to forgive others amen so let's go to the next one just for a moment to uh yeah there you go it's actually a perfect man right here we'll read this quote and I'll stop right here now what this afternoon I want background so much on the virtues we're just going to continue right here and and go on to The Headstone is that okay we'll stop right here but I want you to read it this brother Bradman says he gets that this is paragraph 328 so in building The Virtue building this Monument building this stature not statue stature see it starts off with the foundation stone revelation faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness now what does it do then you're waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love and he controls and he is the strength of every one of these things that's right yes sir right in here right in here you see I got in between all these Works in here and here these little waves come now I I saw one original picture of this that was drawn and there's little waves going here right right brother you've got one somebody's got one because brother Brown's original chart he put Holy Spirit here and then he put little waves because it is it's it's God right putting it into you I mean it's God over all that sealing it together all right right in here right in here you see I got in between all these Works in here and here these little waves come what is that the holy ghost coming down through Christ see holy spirit so it's Christ sure it's Christ in you the hope of glory right here but this is crossing you the hope of glory mature right all right so we're going to look at in the Holy Spirit we're going to look at a mature face right come down here's Babyface that's baby Faith New Birth born baby all right the holy ghost coming down through Christ see Holy Spirit the holy spirit is above all this welding this together all right we're going to look at binding and Welding this afternoon or this afternoon with the Holy Spirit that's what that's put therefore amen that's why building a what a perfect church for the Capstone to cap it off what's it been done it's manifestation through seven Church ages and seven Church Messengers starting back here what was the church first founded what was the Pentecostal Church first founded by Saint Paul in Ephesus the star of the Ephesian Church age scroll it up please second Church age of Smyrna virtue irenius all the way down next Church age was Perkins he talks about all of them what then come Philadelphia godliness Wesley Holiness just shall live by faith then come in brotherly kindness here you are seven Church ages seven steps God building his church is like one person into an individual into itself the glory the power of God coming down through this right here coming down through this because remember look this if you pull it straight down to here it won't fit right everybody got that or can you see it will not fit he's drawing right Paul that's where you pulls come from your third pull it's not a third push you ever tried to push a rope okay you can't control that sucker but you can pull it wherever you want to so it's a pull it's the pull of God the glory the power of God coming down through this What welding it together therefore the Pentecostal people that let out Duluth the Westland and things doesn't know what they're talking about you see they lived in this part of the temple right right that's the way some people can come up that high and drop off but look but look there's a genuine part of that right keeps making that building come on I will restore saith the Lord and that's what he's doing now then he's talking about the the Bright Tree let me read this real quick they raise up another denomination but the heart of the tree kept growing and in the evening time it shall be light and that's where we're at right that swing come Christ the Holy Spirit Jesus comes down and sets himself at the head of the church then and he will resurrect this church being his own body in there is the body in there right right and the way God is expecting us as an individual to grow the way he has brought his church in to grow every Church age it becomes one big church coming amen one big church common these fellows wasn't required what these fellas were this wasn't required they weren't required this in Luther's day they were not required for the full virtue to come then he talks about faith virtue coming up and all this different places Godless brother kindness and brotherly kindness and then the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ and the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you now this is an anointing God's already in you this is an anointing all right it's an anointing the same anointing that came on Jesus right amen amen amen amen and then it lifted off of him at the Garden of Gethsemane what brother Brown said that's what's coming back in the end time amen that's the son of man Ministry listen we'll talk about this afternoon this is the Son of God message seven Church ages got the Son of God God in you Christ in you the hope of glory this is another anointing because that anointing came off Jesus and he could die if that anointing ever comes back on the bride she can't die right and you get all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place when a man possesses these kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him right it's already in you right you just get another anointing no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that God's Got You might do that but until these virtues here go into you the virtues go in then the anointing comes on but when these virtues grow in and you added that to that then you are a living Monument you are a living moving Idol let's stand and we'll get we'll go back into that this afternoon if that's okay Lord willing but that's what that Holy Ghost is for right there it's to seal all this in is to put that same anointing on you that Jesus Christ had the three and a half year message the son of man Ministry the church ages never had the son of man ministry right right they had the Son of God Ministry which was what the Holy Ghost in you sure absolutely but not working the way God wanted to work it was a very immature church now we've come to a place where we have to and if you want to do let's sing this right here and then we'll you got it okay in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus Amen amen we have the victory in the name of Jesus demons will have to have to
