========================================

be with our services here this morning bless the sick the ones that are unspoken lord you know what the needs are come down and bless them all forgive us all of our sins in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you saints how many come expecting this morning looking forward to another another good day well yesterday we had so much uh such a good time and in the lord and really enjoyed the services yesterday so we're um we made it to hebrews chapter four let's just let's just give the lord in prayer before we get into this study well we thank you god for your for allowing us to come together together around your word and we praise these we study these things out that you'll just be with us and open these things up to our heart lord and lord uh you'll just bless the service this morning lord and and let us receive whatever we have need of lord we ask in your name amen so before we get into hebrews chapter 4 i just want to kind of remind you of the the little pattern you know when you read the scripture you kind of look for a little for patterns and things and and to kind of help to help our understanding and paul was following this kind of a little pattern here in hebrews chapter one where he started off with saying who christ was and he said him that he sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high and we know that that kind of patterns out with with uh you know god has a throne in heaven and he and he sat down in the throne of christ and on earth and then he sat down in the throne of our heart when on the day of pentecost and so paul's setting down this pattern that you've got a starting point and then hebrews chapter three we were just going through it said he said harden not your hearts is in the provocation and the day of temptation in the wilderness so once you once you get started then you've got you've got a labor that you go through and you begin to labor and it's like like a ox labor and going going uh pulling a burden and uh you know brother branham would say he would say things like um you know you start coming to church and you you uh you don't quite fit in and you're wondering how things work and you try to work things out yourself so that you you try to you say well i'm gonna make it work and you try to you try to you you slip up and you fall you say well i'm gonna make it work and you try to try to get things going in your life and there's a labor but then then you come paul is talking about in hebrews chapter four let us therefore fear unless the promise being left of us lest us of left us of entering into his rest what we're laboring for is to enter into that rest less lest any of us let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it so now the reason that they did not come into the to the promise of the rest as they were journeying through the wilderness was because they failed to believe god's word they failed to as they as they came to each of those testing places they failed to believe that god was with them that god had raised up moses for the purpose that that their purpose was to go into the promised land the baptism of the holy ghost so on the next slide look at look at that pattern now so believe labor rest believe labor and rest and you know there's a quote that brother ram said in demonology where he said if you can be in a justified state without being sanctified you can believe so you start out believing some you hear a preacher preach about that you can be saved and start preaching things and you and it kind of catches your attention and you say you know i think there's something to this and you start coming to church and you can believe on the lord jesus christ christ and still carry your filth with you you believe but yeah there's you you start laboring out i i've got to i want to get rid of these things in my life and you try to do it your own self and you start working you try to work to get rid of it yourself and then you begin to realize that you can't do it yourself that it takes it takes more than than you're able to do there's got to be something else to happen and he said you can absolutely live in both a justified and a clean holy life and without the holy ghost so you can see that takes the holy ghost to live this life but look at this pattern believe labor rest so you're justified and then you begin to labor and then you're born rest you're born and then then that pattern then that pattern starts again you're born now you start laboring as you're trying to figure what is this seven seals about what is what are all these deep things and you're trying to be probing and pondering and you're you're going and you're studying things out and you're not at rest yet you're at rest what a paradox that you can be at rest but not at rest you're at rest but you're you're laboring and you're trying to get somewhere then finally you get to a place where these these this seven seals can be opened up to you and the the mysteries can be opened up to you and god can actually begin to reveal to you to think the word the message than the way that he wanted it to be taught to understood but yet yet then then you still got some more labor like remember jesus on when he went up to the mount of transfiguration and a voice from heaven said hear ye him and he was coming to that place you know in type of speaking conditions but yet he went straight to the cross straight to the garden of gethsemane labor and father let this cup pass from me labor because there's yet something that's got to die until you finally come what's our ultimate resting place your ultimate resting place was the baptist monolith will take you into the presence of god your body spirit and soul that your body will be changed and you'll be at rest with god that your body will be transformed so look at this pattern and the bible said now we're we're making our way to hebrews chapter four the bible says in john chapter 16 that before before you rest you got to have labor before a baby's born there's going to be labor it's called labor pains labor now think about that pattern that we just looked at before you were born there's labor that's what you can't take the labor out of it you can't take the crying and the praying and the all the the labor out of it and the searching through the scriptures and then after you're born again we're supposed to be born according to the malachi 456 born a new birth according to malafi 456 where we're restored back to the original faith of the fathers restore that kind of birth and that kind of birth also requires a labor you see see how these types these types is is simple but it repeats itself what's repeating itself justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost a woman when she is in travail she's laboring hath sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as she's delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world now what happens after all that labor a life comes into that baby now the baby is in his mother's arms and there's rest so see how this pattern repeats believe labor rest paul said in hebrews chapter 4 let us let us therefore fear unless the promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached and not profit them not being mixed with faith and them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest now see how even as i as as i read these words they mean things different things to different people depending on where you are are you born again now if you're not born again then you'll be you're laboring to get rid of things in your life that shouldn't be there you're laboring to come to a place where where you know what it means to be a christian if you're born again you're laboring to understand the deeper things of god to understand what work to be placed to understand how you how you're placed in the church you're laboring to and and you don't understand maybe you're trying to work those things out but what we're trying what we're going toward is rest now what is rest rest now i got this you just pick this maybe a little bit humorous but rest what what what is our rest from let's really nail that down remember when the last time we were reading where the the lie that satan told eve was thou shalt not surely die because god said god said if you eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil you're gonna die die so now now we're in this place where we're in a we're in a state of death you know you get sick and you're you're struggling and and if you're not born again you're wondering uh you you're wondering what's going to happen to me if i die and atheists in the world wondering what's going to happen after after death do we just kind of peter out and things go into darkness and your life ends and is there is there anything after death so what what were what we're not at rest of of in or or about is is the whole whole question of death death is is what we're we're laboring to escape death so now the bible says when we pass from death when we pass from death unto life when you pass from death to life then the death question is answered and now you're at rest you see rest brother brown said is to have everlasting arrest from all their troubles and all their worries no more task masters now these are brother brown's words no more taskmasters no what's the taskmaster taskmaster is is like the devil kind of he he'll get on somebody and they they feel like they just can't get away from cigarettes and they can't get away from doing things wrong and hating one another and and foul thoughts and foul ideas and foul things coming out of your mouth and the task master is just driving you and but but that's what rest is god god give us the holy ghost so that we could be at rest no more restless nights restless nights wondering what's going to happen to you if you die what restless nights worrying about your family worrying about things rest that's what god wants us to have is rest he said they were on their way to the promised land of rest it flowed with milk and honey the grapes was so big that two men packed one bunch over their shoulders that's the promise that god wanted to give them was that kind of arrest where well they had they had milk and honey all around and everything every every spiritual blessing that god could give on and one of the greatest examples i could think of rest you think about rest is rest is on the inside on the inside you know that the death question is settled that if you were to die you would go straight into the presence of god and so it doesn't matter when all of circumstances and things are tossed your way it doesn't matter i mean it's it's rough it's hard life is hard because they're still after you're boiling again there's still a labor that you're going through there's things that life squeezes in on you but yes yet the death question has been settled because you've passed from death into life now look at this picture jesus there in the boat asleep at rest because he knew who he was he was at rest that life was down on the inside and the boat was being tossed about the storm and all the other disciples were running about frantically trying to trying to figure out what what do we need to do do we need to bail the boat out do we need to do we need to get this get the sails erected do we do we need to row this way or that way and wondering what to do but yet jesus was at rest brother brown said in hebrews chapter four he said which is what we're talking about he said now the thought is if we are on our way to the rest what is the rest where is it i think about that this morning is it joining church if you join if you join church and sit in a pew is that does that settle the death question are you settled down on the inside to be to be sitting here next to other believers is it being baptized a certain way if we say we got well we got our doctrine right we know how to be baptized whether it's frontwards or backwards or all the way or part way if we got all these things settled does that settle the death question down on the inside are you at rest do you have peace that if you were to die on the way home from church tonight that you will go straight into the arms of god is it becoming a member of the greatest church in the city wearing better clothes is it education is it money so we can quit work and just lay down rest the rest of our life as we call it when you think about that look at all the rich people of the world the bill gates and elon musk and all the ones that have billions in the bank does that give you rest despite all the money that they've got in the bank yeah if that doesn't settle the that's quit the death question he said that's not it now the word sabbath i got this definition the jewish sabbath from it comes from the hebrew shabbat to rest it's observed throughout the year on the seventh day of the week saturday and the old testament the seventh day was saturday well the seventh day is still saturday according to biblical tradition that commemorates the original seventh day in which god rested after complete completing the creation because in genesis chapter two it says thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made let's see see that how that pattern repeats even and and he began to labor he labored and he labored at through six days and then he rested at the end and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in the he that because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made and in deuteronomy the fourth commandment was six days shout thou labor and do all that work but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy knox nor thine ass nor any of the cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou now the fourth commandment you remember that how we read about moses went up to the top of the the top of the mountain and he came down with the ten commandments and brother adam said those were the seals what what were the ten commandments the ten commandments were the attributes of god that he wanted to display in his people that you would you would serve the lord thy god with all your heart and all your soul and he would honor that uh honor that father and mother and you would uh love your neighbor and all of those things but you know when when jesus began to preach the ten commandments on the on the sermon on the mountain when he began to relay talk about the beatitudes and things brother brown said he left out he left out the fourth commandment he began to magnify the law and and and explain how that what those ten commandments really were the spiritual application but he left out the fourth commandment now now there there's something really important here that that we need to see because when when jesus was preaching about the the ten commandments there he he he preached it in a way so that you would they would begin to understand that there was something something about that something about the ten commandments that you could not satisfy yourself you could try to live a good life you could try to try to be a good person but he opened these things up in a way that that to begin to prick people in their heart to know that you need the spirit of god like like the brother was preaching yesterday about how the samson samson's life would have been nothing without the spirit of god in his life so let's let's look at what jesus said as he was preaching leaving out the fourth commandment as he was preaching all the all these ten commandments we'll just kind of examine a few things that he said because in matthew chapter five and again we're talking about rest coming to a place where we're at rest he said think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfill and how is he how is he going to fulfill the law in the prophets how he's going to fulfill it he's going to fulfill it by taking his life and yielding it on the cross and on the day of pentecost giving it back to you and that'll fulfill everything that was written for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one little one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven so let's take a look at the way that jesus broke these commandments down and i got these little images up here a little bit funny i guess but the point is we're trying to make the he as he broke these commandments down he he's explaining there's something that that you need beyond your own works there's something beyond just the the religiosity of the pharisees and the sadducees there's something beyond just just going to church and saying you're a good christian so in matthew chapter 5 he said ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of that now see how in the old testament you could say well i've met the requirement i've never killed anybody so i met the requirement but he magnified it to the place where you can't meet that requirement unless you've got the holy ghost unless you're at rest unless god's life comes and lives in you and changes your heart so now he exposes it that it's a heart problem how do you get where why are we not at rest if you're not born again because there's a problem with your heart that's where the problem is with your heart whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raqqa shall be in danger of the counsel but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and their remembrance that thy brother hath all against thee leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled with my brother and then come and offer thy gift now look at all these different examples he's he's using that that if you if you if you if you're angry with your brother without a cause you'll be in danger of the judgment if you say to your brother you're empty-headed like that's the insult that they use you're empty you're worth nothing you'll be in danger of the council but if if you say you you fool you're you're you're not even is there any good in you shall be in danger of hell fire in other words the problem starts from down in your heart in your soul the problem starts from there and if you're angry with your brother without a cause then you're just then you're guilty of murder just as the same as now see why why did he say you're guilty of murder as as we're running out of time here is because because that goes back to where the problem started with cain and abel that cain hated abel without a cause why did he hate him because because just because he told him the truth and he hated it there was something wrong with his heart he hated him without a cause and killed him and killed him and so jesus is going back to those those stories joseph's brother and hated him without a cause without a cause and threw him in the well saul hated david without a cause why did he why did he throw that javelin at him because david david was just trying to do right there was nothing wrong no nothing that david was doing that was wrong he was just trying to be a good god-fearing person and the pharisees and sadducees hated jesus without a cause you see how when you hate somebody without a cause many times it's because they're telling you the truth or because they're trying to live a godly life in front of you you hate them because they don't dress the way that you do or they you hate them because they don't drink alcohol with you after work after you go to work and they don't want to go to the places that you go to and you hate them you don't know why you hate them but you just hate them because there's coming is coming from a place a place of a of a a cankered heart but if you can get that heart problem fixed then you'll be at rest that's why i got this picture here see the guy with his hand over his heart because the heart is the problem in matthew chapter 5 you have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not commit adultery but i say indeed that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already where in his heart and his heart because there's something wrong with a man that would look after look after somebody that's not his wife and lust after her there's something wrong there's something wrong there and if you can fix that problem you can't fix it by your own works or your own doings or your own labor but you can fit get it fixed by the baptism of the holy ghost and jesus said if thy right i offend thee not listen to this if thy right i offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell now look at this parable that he's saying if you knew just think about this if you knew that your right eye would keep you from the kingdom of heaven wouldn't you want to get rid of it if you really valued going to heaven you would want to get rid of it what if it was your what if it was your right hand or your left hand or your uh you and you knew first certainty that that would keep you from going to heaven you'd want to get rid of it wouldn't you so what's jesus saying he's saying get at the root of the problem don't don't hang on to the thing that's that's keeping you from going to heaven and say i can't lay this down he's not he's not requiring it because your right eye is not going to keep you from heaven and your right your right hand or whatever is not going to keep you from heaven but what will keep you from heaven is the old cankered heart so so just like he's saying don't don't uh value your body part if that is what would keep you from going to heaven don't hold back the thing from god that if it was changed would would allow you interest into heaven give your give your heart over to god allow him allow him to come in and take his abode in you in matthew chapter five is we've got just a few more minutes he said it has been said whosoever shall put his way as a wife let him give her a writing of divorcement but i say unto you he's look he's exposing the heart problem but you know in the old testament if uh let's see i got the scripture here i thought in deuteron i think it was deuteronomy 19. you could you could put away your wife for you just you just got displeased with her maybe maybe she got older and and you say well i i don't think she looks nice anymore she didn't fix my grits the way i wanted to be fixed or whatever it is and you could just put so so what's jesus exposing where is the love where's the love where's it's a heart problem because you know where when you're at rest there's not going to be any more divorces if god brings rest to a home and you're at rest down in your heart there's going to be a true an atmosphere of true love and you love one another and and you're willing to to do for one another and and uh and and all those things i'm trying to teach now i'm not you could preach this he said but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of foreign occasion causes her to commit adultery cause so he's exposing that see what you're doing if you put away your wife just because you're displeased with her and you look what you're causing her to do to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committed committeth adultery and he said in in in verse 38 you have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but i say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn out thou away what's what's he saying he's saying we don't we don't yield from weakness just to the course of natural events but we if somebody does something wrong you don't withhold from them and say well it's my right but yet because you love one another you will and you're willing to let somebody not maybe not pay a debt back to you you're willing to suffer yourself as paul said to be defrauded because because your heart has been changed and the musicians can come forward and we'll we'll just stop on that why why are we laboring for rest because we need we need to there's something lacking in our lives we need the rest that only comes from the baptism of the holy ghost let's just go to the lord in prayer as we close god we thank you lord jesus for your grace to us lord and we just come expecting this this morning little god that you'll touch us and speak to every need lord and we just pray god at your lord help us to be receptive this morning and that you'll give brother matthew lord liberty to speak lord from his heart we pray we i just ask this blessing upon this service this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
