[20:55] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[20:56] Prudence have having made known unto us
[20:59] the mystery of his will according to his
[21:02] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[21:04] himself that in the dispensation of the
[21:07] fullness of time he might gather
[21:09] together in one all things in Christ
[21:12] both which are in heaven and which are
[21:15] on earth even in him all right now let's
[21:19] go to the revelations three and that was
[21:22] the hour that we're living in the time
[21:24] so we'll begin with verse
[21:27] 14 Revelation 3:14 and unto the angel of
[21:30] the Church of the lady of candr these
[21:32] things sayith the amen the faithful and
[21:34] true witness the beginning of the
[21:36] creation of God I Know Thy works that
[21:40] thou art neither cold nor hot I would
[21:43] thou W cold or hot so then because Thou
[21:46] Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I
[21:49] will spew thee out of my mouth because
[21:52] thou sayest why is he going to spew them
[21:54] out
[21:55] now because thou sayest I am rich and
[21:59] increase with goods and have need of
[22:02] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[22:05] wretched and miserable and poor and
[22:07] blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of
[22:10] me gold tried in the fire that thou
[22:13] mayest be rich and white Ramen that thou
[22:16] mayest be clothed and that the shame of
[22:18] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[22:21] thine eyes with i saave that thou mayest
[22:24] see as many as I love I rebuke and
[22:28] chasen be zealous therefore and repent
[22:32] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[22:35] any man hear my voice and open the door
[22:38] I will come into him and will shut with
[22:41] him and he with me you may be seated the
[22:45] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[22:48] the word all right now we try to pick
[22:52] back up where we left off in there
[22:56] talking this morning
[22:59] and believing
[23:01] that you know now I'm I'm asking you
[23:06] this message to listen very
[23:08] carefully because it it's it's going to
[23:12] be a little uh problem because it's like
[23:16] I
[23:17] said how could brother
[23:20] brandham now stand up and flatly
[23:26] rebuke the Pentecost
[23:29] in every message you know the
[23:32] Presbyterian Baptist Methodist and all
[23:33] the rest but didn't we say Pentecostals
[23:35] because that would cover why would he
[23:38] stand up and rebuke them and tell them
[23:41] that they had done this they had done
[23:42] that they lost their first love they had
[23:44] went away from the word of God uh and
[23:47] all like that and said you've turned
[23:51] away from God when in ever service they
[23:54] were
[23:55] having sick healed
[24:00] dead raised not just my brother random
[24:03] now limbs
[24:05] restored the greatest
[24:08] Revival brother brandham said now if you
[24:10] want this I'll be glad to find it the
[24:13] greatest Revival he said that had ever
[24:15] been for mankind was the isusa
[24:19] Street
[24:20] Revival now you know where he comes on
[24:22] up with that he doesn't just put it 1906
[24:25] and stop he comes up on up in into his
[24:29] ministry in the times 20s and 30s and
[24:33] 40s and he said the greatest Revival
[24:35] that's ever been said been going now he
[24:38] was saying it own for 15 years he
[24:41] said but
[24:44] why do you realize what's that
[24:50] saying come on do you do you realize
[24:52] what's being
[24:54] said wouldn't that be the same as taking
[24:57] some somebody that
[24:59] had everything in the world and all of
[25:01] the doings and everything and you walk
[25:04] right up in your fa their face and
[25:06] they're telling you they've got all and
[25:08] they and they have it and you walk up to
[25:10] them and said you ain't got
[25:15] it that don't don't on
[25:19] you I you you say he was a
[25:23] prophet you say that he was had the word
[25:25] of
[25:26] God and he preached a message called
[25:29] where Pentecost
[25:32] failed the greatest Revival the world
[25:36] has ever
[25:37] seen now I'm not I'm quoting him so see
[25:41] you got your ideas no that ain't I
[25:43] believe it's well now you can say what
[25:45] you want to I'm going to stay what he
[25:48] says the greatest Revival's ever been
[25:51] and then he's rebuking the people
[25:54] right right while it's going on
[25:58] it's easy to think of back in the say
[26:02] the 40s 50s coming on up into you know
[26:06] the 60s things had started drying
[26:09] away but still remember look at all of
[26:11] the great mve that was going on in the
[26:19] 60s that
[26:21] don't see you'll never understand what
[26:24] he
[26:25] means until you get it settled in your
[26:28] own heart and life of understanding how
[26:31] would it be that Christ would be as we
[26:34] read it just now on the outside of the
[26:37] door a church knocking to try to get
[26:39] back in you know what you're going to
[26:41] put
[26:42] it you're going to put it that they
[26:44] rejected brother
[26:48] brandham now he puts it
[26:51] different we know he done that we know
[26:55] he turned down the message and sent
[26:57] wouldn't let the messeng we know he had
[26:59] 500,000 here and 30 over here maybe 10
[27:02] in the meetings and that sure we know
[27:05] that but just remember he was already
[27:08] saying
[27:11] that 61 I got some in here 61 62s and
[27:15] there even before the seal broke and he
[27:17] was already rebuking the
[27:24] Pentecostals then how do you think that
[27:26] he was put out
[27:29] what was he
[27:30] saying how can you say that Christ is
[27:33] outside the door knocking trying to get
[27:35] back in when he's inside Healing The
[27:38] Sick great moves are taking place great
[27:42] things are
[27:44] happening but you say he's outside the
[27:49] door that that don't ring a bell with
[27:53] you or make you at least say hey well I
[27:56] wish I could know about this or why
[27:58] because you know you admit that it's
[28:04] true think we better settle down to find
[28:07] out what's going on could it be that we
[28:09] have him outside the
[28:11] door hope
[28:15] not no he's right here
[28:20] well do you get to
[28:22] setting your Pentecostal people had the
[28:26] great move they are still having great
[28:30] moves great things are taking
[28:34] place but yet we say he's not
[28:38] there well who's doing
[28:43] it who's who's doing it who's there
[28:46] Healing The Sick who's there in all the
[28:51] things you see we get it all we think
[28:53] well well and then see I know then I
[28:55] come along and say and then have I been
[28:57] become your enemy then because I tell
[28:58] you the truth you say but we've got this
[29:01] great moves and brother see we'll say
[29:03] here people will say but brother Dale we
[29:06] don't have the great moves like it's
[29:07] over in brother so and so's Church the
[29:09] great anointings the great things that
[29:11] are happening I agree with
[29:13] you I agree with
[29:16] you but are you going to say that we
[29:19] don't have
[29:20] anything but they
[29:22] do are you going to put it on
[29:25] the move the anointing or what are you
[29:29] going to put it on what is your reason
[29:32] for being in
[29:35] Lula well this ain't nowhere else to
[29:39] go I'm sorry that that don't fit too
[29:44] good so you see the setting of where I'm
[29:47] at of what I'm talking
[29:48] about and we talked about this morning
[29:52] we talked about coming from we we've
[29:54] been talking about the dispensations
[29:57] right
[29:58] and we talked about the great
[29:59] dispensations coming down and we spent a
[30:02] lot of services on the son of man
[30:04] dispensation getting that down and
[30:07] getting him as the Healer the Savior the
[30:09] Redeemer even to him that spoke us into
[30:12] being and that's the only way he can be
[30:15] the father that he wanted to be was to
[30:17] be the son of
[30:18] man and bringing it
[30:21] forth and then this morning we talked
[30:24] about going from changing dispensation
[30:28] and remember the quote I gave you I'll
[30:30] give it to you maybe in here I know I'll
[30:32] got it for Wednesday or not but for next
[30:34] Sunday you know
[30:39] that the great things always
[30:43] happen at the time of a changing
[30:50] dispensation it's always been he
[30:53] said when the change of dispensation
[30:55] come said there's a great
[30:57] things take
[31:00] place well you think about
[31:04] it this is an example when isusa Street
[31:07] came was not there a great
[31:12] move wouldn't that a change of
[31:15] dispensation all right then when brother
[31:17] brandham stepped onto the scene during
[31:20] the time of the ausa street moving that
[31:24] was still going on in the 40s and 30s
[31:28] great things were taking
[31:36] place we need to consider where we're at
[31:39] and what's going
[31:40] on so well we're in the message well all
[31:44] right that's that's
[31:48] fine as we'll get to it in a few minutes
[31:50] in the message in Isaiah 4 And1 it talks
[31:54] about and this is speaking of Israel I
[31:56] know but it's speaking of the last
[31:59] days that in that day seven women shall
[32:02] take hold of one man saying we will eat
[32:05] our own bread we our own garment only
[32:09] let us be called by thy
[32:12] name to take
[32:15] away our reproach
[32:19] amen it used to be that it was a shame
[32:21] for a woman to have a baby it's not a
[32:23] shame to have 10 or 15 long as she got
[32:25] somewhere where she got married one time
[32:27] down through life at least you
[32:31] know can't you see then the churches
[32:33] saying you know just let us be called by
[32:37] thy
[32:38] name I mean do you really think now
[32:41] listen I'm trying to be serious as
[32:43] serious can be do you think that the
[32:45] Baptist don't want God in their
[32:49] church I mean you is there a sign up at
[32:51] the door God you don't come in
[32:55] here but but yet the Bible says he's on
[32:58] the outside the door knocking that's
[33:02] right well the Pentecostal don't have
[33:04] signs all over the place God not
[33:06] welcomed in
[33:10] here
[33:12] no how about the people of this message
[33:14] is it signs over the door we don't want
[33:16] God inside here
[33:21] no let us be called by thy
[33:25] name come Among Us Lord and work all
[33:29] miracles and signs and wonders wasn't
[33:32] that what they done when he was
[33:34] alive was he not welcomed when he was
[33:36] Healing The Sick and casting out devils
[33:39] and feeding the
[33:45] people well what about the hour and the
[33:47] day we're living in right so we spoke
[33:50] this morning about how that he he was
[33:52] son of man you know and gave his life to
[33:56] to release that Son of God that was
[33:58] inside of
[34:01] him and when it did and on the day of
[34:03] Pentecost when it came back it started
[34:05] another dispensation the prophet said he
[34:08] said this is the dispensation of the Son
[34:10] of
[34:11] God he said it's not son of man now this
[34:15] is Son of God well then I even have
[34:18] given you illustration over and over
[34:20] that you have nobody mentioning son of
[34:24] man the great Apostle Paul and all of
[34:27] the writings they don't talk about son
[34:29] of
[34:30] man can't you see then that's what took
[34:33] place that was so hidden until the Son
[34:36] of God was
[34:39] there but it was not the
[34:42] dispensation if it had been the
[34:43] dispensation of you know of of that it
[34:46] would have come into being for the
[34:48] church what I
[34:50] mean so he gave his own
[34:54] life that the son of God God come in
[34:57] could come into being and on the day of
[34:59] Pentecost it would start another
[35:02] dispensation a dispensation of the
[35:05] baptism of the Holy
[35:07] Ghost a dispensation of Christ coming
[35:11] and living in
[35:13] you a dispensation of eternal life
[35:16] imparted to the people of
[35:20] God and Son of man's not mentioned
[35:23] because it's not supposed to be
[35:27] just as while Jesus was here he was son
[35:29] of man son of man son of man didn't
[35:31] mention Son of God now come on there is
[35:34] places in there that he says things and
[35:36] and all like that and that's one thing I
[35:38] like about brother brandham he he never
[35:40] made it to where he would say you can't
[35:43] find him saying Son of God then you'll
[35:45] hear him in the message and say see
[35:47] there he called himself Son of
[35:50] God but what he's meaning is what he's
[35:54] saying as a whole of the whole m message
[35:57] in the hour was son of
[35:59] man but at the same time he was the son
[36:01] of
[36:03] God all right so now as we're going into
[36:06] this don't lose what I'm getting
[36:10] at he gave his life release the life as
[36:13] son of man
[36:16] dispensation where the Holy Ghost could
[36:18] come into the
[36:19] people and be the Son of God and would
[36:23] be that we gave it over and over this
[36:25] morning son of God dispensation down
[36:27] through the church
[36:30] ages
[36:32] right and just as you would say that he
[36:35] never said anything about it when he was
[36:38] son of man he never mentioned Son of God
[36:41] he'd always say son of man all right
[36:44] then when you get into the church ages
[36:45] it's never mentioned in son of
[36:47] man because that's not the dispensation
[36:51] it was the son of God dispensation but
[36:53] all at once right at the end supposed to
[36:56] be the end of of the
[36:58] age a prophet comes on the scene and he
[37:01] begins to talk about son of
[37:04] man mankind couldn't understand why he
[37:06] was talking about
[37:08] that they couldn't follow him other than
[37:11] he was
[37:12] declaring they thought himself to be a
[37:16] prophet and that was great cuz that was
[37:18] what was taking place but that was not
[37:21] all of it
[37:24] remember I said this morning you know I
[37:26] could spend great times speaking and we
[37:28] could we could spend weeks and months
[37:30] talking about this son of God
[37:32] dispensation but the main thing I want
[37:35] you to get is the son of man and what he
[37:38] was doing made way that it could change
[37:42] dispensations and to come into Son of
[37:45] God dispensation
[37:47] right see now in this age and time it's
[37:53] going to have to come back to where
[37:57] that the Son of God
[37:59] Will Make Way for the son of
[38:04] man statue of perfect man all the way up
[38:07] through here till you get to where it
[38:09] says holy spirit is Son of
[38:11] God headstone is the son of man you tell
[38:15] me what else it would
[38:19] be right see then you'll see why I kept
[38:22] asking the question why is it the son of
[38:25] man had to return in the life last
[38:29] days it's just not as we say God sent a
[38:32] prophet God sent a prophet God sent a
[38:34] prophet thank
[38:40] God but what about the rest of the
[38:45] story didn't they preach brother brandom
[38:48] as a sheath
[38:50] wave right you've heard those things
[38:53] preached you that he was a she wave and
[38:55] know no Jes Jesus Christ is a sheep
[38:58] wave but he was waved through brother
[39:00] brandom we thank God for that see we
[39:02] know the truth but you know the truth is
[39:05] hard to
[39:08] believe
[39:10] right that's why there's so much lying
[39:12] okay all right let's get to
[39:16] going but
[39:18] now so we talk about this
[39:21] morning that the son of man gave his
[39:25] life just the son of God can come into
[39:27] being on the day of Pentecost all right
[39:29] now then we're going to deal
[39:32] with we'll mention a little bit about
[39:35] the son of man but not very much because
[39:38] it will take us into another message
[39:40] totally but we're going to talk about
[39:42] this son of man and what we're going to
[39:45] I mean Son of God and what we're going
[39:47] to talk about is how the Son of God was
[39:50] put out of the
[39:53] church and the Son of God is the spirit
[39:56] God God
[40:00] right am I right now Spirit
[40:04] God but how is the spirit God put out of
[40:06] the church when everybody in the church
[40:08] is crying and hollering and praising
[40:14] him well brother you're just you're just
[40:17] too strong them people they really love
[40:19] God with all of their
[40:23] heart I ain't saying it don't
[40:28] I ain't saying they
[40:30] don't I'm just asking what's
[40:34] wrong come on you've been in the message
[40:37] 10 20 30 40 years 50 60 50 years at
[40:43] least and going on into toward
[40:48] 60 and you don't think
[40:51] about what's going on in the hour and
[40:53] the time that we're
[40:55] living right or is it
[40:58] just woman in the White
[41:00] House Russia coming after
[41:04] oil may I say more or brother randam
[41:07] coming back and putting up a tent all
[41:09] across the
[41:10] country that goes with it just me to
[41:13] anything else cuz I done told you over
[41:15] and over where I
[41:17] stand I've done put that I done warned
[41:21] you too if you think brother Brown going
[41:23] to come back a tent and put it up and
[41:25] come across the country just remember
[41:26] the devil's going to beat him to it cuz
[41:29] he knows the
[41:30] story you say well he don't know about
[41:34] this he's heard brother randam and he's
[41:36] heard plenty of preachers talking about
[41:38] tents and you think he ain't going to
[41:41] forun it how are you going to know who's
[41:47] who well I'll know okay all right praise
[41:54] God I'm just trying to warn us not to
[41:57] put everything upon one point that's
[42:02] right brother bradam said the the Bible
[42:05] speaks of a time had come that the moon
[42:07] would turn to
[42:10] blood people are still in the message
[42:12] arguing by when brother Brown done said
[42:14] it he said I can show you where that's
[42:15] already took
[42:18] place well I don't know where it took
[42:22] place well you can say well it's the
[42:24] church it's this it's that and that I
[42:26] said all right brother Brown didn't tell
[42:27] us that's what it was he just told us he
[42:29] just said I can show you that's already
[42:30] taking
[42:32] place but what if we're looking for
[42:34] something that's already taking
[42:40] place no you're you're you're you're
[42:43] okay I'm putting all of that in one
[42:45] category the same category that I'm
[42:48] talking about when I
[42:49] started how is it that you got a church
[42:53] of a 100 people 100 people 500 people
[42:55] whatever and they're all clapping their
[42:57] hands and praising God and Glory
[42:59] Hallelujah I love the Lord and tears
[43:02] just rolling and they're crying and
[43:04] they're praying and they're they mean it
[43:06] seriously mean
[43:11] it and God's outside the
[43:14] door according to the
[43:17] Bible well now you don't well now that's
[43:20] up to
[43:23] you now the only thing I'm going to say
[43:26] is one point about
[43:29] it if you believe he's outside the
[43:32] church anything you want to make it
[43:34] Pentecostal Baptist Methodist brandit or
[43:37] whatever and keep our little group and
[43:38] said no he's not outside of our church
[43:39] he's he's inside our
[43:41] church if you're going to do all of
[43:44] that you
[43:46] know and have all of that I want to ask
[43:51] you why he's the outside the
[43:55] church
[43:59] well you say automatically in your mind
[44:02] that they've turned down the
[44:06] word well that's
[44:10] true but yet there were still rejoicing
[44:14] about the God I mean show me one
[44:17] Christian church with any sense
[44:19] whatsoever that would get up and say we
[44:22] don't want God in
[44:24] here no they're crying they're praying
[44:27] they're
[44:30] rejoicing and yet God has left
[44:35] them could it be again like it was in
[44:38] the
[44:39] Bible didn't Titus when he came into
[44:44] Jerusalem that the people run into the
[44:47] temple because it was a sensible place
[44:51] to go because they thought God would
[44:52] fight for them and they run into the
[44:55] temple
[44:59] but come find out they had killed the
[45:01] god of the
[45:03] temple now I didn't have nothing to do
[45:05] with killing
[45:09] him you make those statements to me you
[45:11] know what they mean what you're doing
[45:13] right now and what's in your mind God
[45:15] knows and he knows what you're thinking
[45:18] now and would do now you would have done
[45:21] then that's
[45:24] right okay
[45:26] trying to be sensible about the
[45:31] message and look at it straight
[45:36] blunt and
[45:38] see but brother Dale I love the Lord
[45:41] Jesus with all of my heart I would give
[45:43] everything and they truly mean
[45:47] it but why they will they not receive
[45:50] the
[45:52] word well that's just what you're saying
[45:54] about it we've got the word
[45:57] may I quotee brother brand he said they
[45:59] have just enough of the word to make it
[46:01] work do you need that
[46:05] quote they not a church that ain't built
[46:07] on something about the
[46:11] word what makes us different than
[46:13] anybody
[46:17] else you don't I know evidently you
[46:21] don't consider that but what about
[46:24] it so let's go ahead and get started on
[46:27] the quoting part all
[46:28] right because you can argue what I got
[46:30] to say but at least it's up here and you
[46:32] got to read it has left up to you go
[46:34] ahead with number one we pull it up it's
[46:36] the the mighty conqueror preached in
[46:40] 1956 all right look as he's coming down
[46:42] on Earth and was not to be made made an
[46:45] angel he came down on Earth and took the
[46:47] form of a bondsman not an angel not come
[46:50] down in great Jehovah
[46:52] Glory but and what but come came down as
[46:57] a man to redeem man to die for man to
[47:01] die for as a
[47:03] man he never died as
[47:05] God cuz God can't die that's
[47:10] sensible he died as a
[47:13] man the sin of man was upon the son of
[47:17] man and he had to become a man in order
[47:20] to pay the
[47:21] penalty so he paid the
[47:23] price the son of man
[47:29] he never died as God you can't kill God
[47:33] the people in this message about the
[47:34] river Jordans and this up there well it
[47:36] had to be this and it had to be that one
[47:37] of the men says you know my God can't
[47:39] die well brother Bram said God
[47:43] died then he says God can't
[47:47] die well he's confused I ain't cuz my
[47:50] God can't die go ahead I guess we need
[47:52] to be following
[47:53] you but come on Church
[47:56] but now look look at the next one just
[47:58] tying back to the morning where we'll
[47:59] get the talk and watch how it ties so
[48:02] perfectly
[48:04] to and shows you the end time that
[48:07] there's going to have to be two
[48:10] dispensations to come into being at one
[48:14] time which has never been
[48:20] before Son of God and son of man is
[48:22] going to have to overlap in this a is
[48:26] last
[48:29] dispensation cuz you can't take it with
[48:31] one by itself so listen to what he says
[48:34] he's talking about it the lest Church
[48:36] age 1960 he comes down the first back
[48:40] there I'm last over here and I'm the
[48:43] beginning of the creation of God once
[48:46] through the church
[48:48] ages that we're to have you will learn
[48:52] that I'm
[48:54] God
[48:57] did not each Church age get a revelation
[48:59] of the Supreme de deity right each age
[49:04] has got a revelation of supreme so you
[49:06] should be every age should be at least
[49:08] in every Age The Bride did have the
[49:12] connection to believe in God as real no
[49:15] matter what age it is all right now look
[49:18] he said learned that I God God created
[49:21] in a man
[49:24] form I'm the beginning of the creation
[49:26] of God he said I don't to make a
[49:27] presbyterian shout the creation of God
[49:30] when was God created when God was made
[49:33] flesh in Jesus Christ and dwelt Among Us
[49:38] right back to the son of
[49:41] man but it's to be known down Through
[49:43] the Ages what that he's
[49:47] God it will wind up in this age knowing
[49:50] he's the beginning of the creation of
[49:52] God there was God in human flesh
[49:57] the overlap everything is tied together
[50:00] all right so watch
[50:02] now watch the next one when then we'll
[50:04] get our
[50:05] Point look at number three the Mighty
[50:09] God then we find after his death burial
[50:13] and Resurrection he came on the day of
[50:15] Pentecost as Son of God God the
[50:18] spirit in the
[50:20] form Holy Ghost what was he doing he was
[50:24] changing
[50:26] himself making himself known to the
[50:29] people in a different
[50:32] form there's your dispensation like the
[50:35] Holy Spirit which is God he came to deal
[50:37] through the church ages as Son of God
[50:40] the Holy Spirit same God all the time
[50:43] right
[50:45] now so he's revealing himself to every
[50:49] age as a revelation of his
[50:53] deity but it winds up in our marvelous
[50:56] statement in the end time to this
[51:00] age as the age comes down to an end and
[51:04] he gets to the 20th verse which is
[51:06] automatically the 21st and 22nd is to
[51:10] the
[51:11] Overcomer but he rebukes remember he's
[51:14] preaching to both true and false in
[51:17] every age is that
[51:18] right and he comes down to
[51:22] say he's on outside the door knocking
[51:26] trying to get back
[51:28] in I'll quote one and then get back to
[51:30] it he said what about the Son of
[51:33] God outside of his
[51:36] church see because you're automatically
[51:38] going to run to the bases to try to prop
[51:40] up your thoughts and because you don't
[51:42] have any to understand the Str you're
[51:43] going to run back to well it was a son
[51:45] of man that will go with
[51:51] it but he was put out as Son of
[51:54] God
[51:58] don't you see the embarrassment of the
[51:59] situation I'm talking about brother R
[52:02] said ain't that embarrassing ain't that
[52:03] a
[52:04] shame that he's outside of his own
[52:07] church go home tonight put a tape on
[52:11] about 50 or early
[52:15] 60 and listen and hear him
[52:18] rebuking the
[52:21] Pentecostals that are still in the midst
[52:23] of a great Revival
[52:26] a great move among
[52:33] them you don't listen and think like
[52:37] that why would he be rebuking the
[52:40] Pentecostals why would not he be
[52:42] praising them all the time he does
[52:43] praise them because it's true but the
[52:46] biggest portion you know is a
[52:51] rebuke cuz remember what he would be
[52:54] saying if he said you methodists can
[52:56] look at the
[52:58] Lutheran he said you Pentecostals can
[53:00] look at the Methodist but he said I can
[53:02] look at
[53:04] you you say it was only sure it is in
[53:07] there the son of man is what gets turned
[53:11] down but remember his rebuke is before
[53:14] the son of man comes into being on the
[53:17] basis of the
[53:23] dispensation you
[53:25] I just don't understand you you just say
[53:29] things church I'm trying my best to tell
[53:32] you and
[53:33] me what if Christ is outside of this
[53:36] church trying to get in and yet we're
[53:40] crying and praying and singing and
[53:42] worshiping every bit of every
[53:45] service what if he cannot come in the
[53:50] door but I don't see that no it's cuz
[53:54] you don't want to see it because you
[53:57] realize what I'm saying that if he's
[53:59] outside the door of this church then I
[54:02] don't care what the worship is
[54:05] inside the worship inside and the great
[54:08] things and the movement is the
[54:14] anointing it is not the person of God it
[54:17] is the
[54:19] anointing the great signs and
[54:24] wonders
[54:26] is this the most deceiving age that
[54:27] there is is it the scripture would say
[54:30] that it would deceive the very elect if
[54:32] it was possible see I'm going to
[54:35] automatically quote but we can't be
[54:36] deceived brother randam said you need
[54:38] this one he said frankly he get the
[54:41] bride so messed up you know what he said
[54:43] he'd have to cut the work short you need
[54:45] that
[54:50] one see I just don't want you and
[54:53] I to settle in to a
[54:57] point we're in the message and then we
[55:01] settle in to a we know more about the
[55:04] message than these other churches
[55:10] do and I'm not going to back up and say
[55:13] we
[55:19] don't I hope you
[55:23] don't because if if you don't why don't
[55:26] you go to the other
[55:28] churches cuz you know what you're saying
[55:31] you're saying this is not right well
[55:33] then you need to go with what's right
[55:38] that's but brother Dale I've never heard
[55:40] nobody talk to way you talk you never
[55:42] will because I just talk like I
[55:45] am I've always been this way I've never
[55:48] had anything else why change
[55:52] now right but see think about about it
[55:56] he said he was changing
[55:59] himself he came and dealt Through the
[56:01] Ages as Son of God well see he's still
[56:06] dealing cuz listen you want the quote
[56:09] you got the quotes I know what you're
[56:10] talking about I know where they're at I
[56:12] don't mean the pay right now but I can
[56:14] find them in a hurry where brother Brown
[56:15] said the lady you see and age is over
[56:18] but then what about the quote I was just
[56:19] looking at a minute ago just out run
[56:21] across it he said the lady o age is not
[56:23] over he said it don't end
[56:26] until the Rapture or the tribulation
[56:30] would end the lady you'll see an age
[56:32] which you know what then I can give you
[56:34] another quote he said the lady see and
[56:36] age will go on until it strikes a
[56:39] millennium because it's still under a
[56:44] seven that's what to say we say we know
[56:46] all about
[56:50] it we're ready to
[56:53] go are
[57:00] we watch
[57:03] now go ahead to number
[57:07] four guess I got some A's on these so if
[57:11] I hit the wrong one I'll catch up with
[57:13] you which is the Feast of the trumpets
[57:17] 1964 now he's been revealed through the
[57:20] church ages now watch through the church
[57:21] ages as Son of God God being the spirit
[57:24] the holy Spirit he revealed himself in
[57:26] the church ages as in the congregation
[57:29] as the Holy Spirit among the
[57:31] people we find in the ladyo age the last
[57:36] Church age he is put out of the
[57:40] church nowhere else was he ever put out
[57:43] in any age but in the lady oan
[57:46] age say we're rich and have need of
[57:49] nothing he said was put out of the
[57:53] church
[57:57] don't say well it's only cause brother
[57:59] brandham came and
[58:02] started he came to rebuke them because
[58:05] they got away from Pentecost
[58:10] amen
[58:12] right see then they naturally turned him
[58:16] down but just remember the point I'm
[58:19] making to you is the if you throw the
[58:22] son of man out and you keep the son of
[58:24] got in what kind of a thing have you got
[58:27] you got a split part of your God that's
[58:32] right you said well I just don't see how
[58:34] they could how they could put out
[58:36] because if they're in there worshiping
[58:38] and having a good time that's what I'm
[58:39] telling
[58:42] you you can worship and shout and scream
[58:45] and holler the sick can be healed all
[58:48] kind of
[58:52] Miracles and yet God be on the outside
[58:58] no no I can't be because he's inside
[58:59] doing
[59:01] it well maybe we need to close our doors
[59:06] and go over
[59:10] there
[59:18] no if they've got the
[59:21] anointing and signs and wonders are
[59:23] taking place and we have not as much as
[59:27] they
[59:31] have don't you think we might order to
[59:33] change
[59:39] places and if that's true then I'll ask
[59:42] you the other part of the question why
[59:43] did you
[59:47] leave
[59:49] right why did you leave if that's what
[59:51] it
[59:53] is
[59:55] well I just don't understand how the the
[59:57] move of God can be you don't understand
[59:59] the end time as the anointed
[1:00:02] ones with the genuine baptism of the
[1:00:06] Holy
[1:00:12] Spirit
[1:00:14] right look what he says on number five
[1:00:17] and it says Investments
[1:00:20] 1963 in Revelations 3 we read that to
[1:00:23] the lest in church Chase we're pictured
[1:00:26] one of the most saddest pictures of all
[1:00:28] the
[1:00:30] Bible Revelation 3 at the lady ofan
[1:00:32] Church all the rest of the churches
[1:00:34] through the Lutheran age the seven
[1:00:36] Church ages each one it didn't said
[1:00:39] about Jesus being in the church in other
[1:00:42] words watch what he said he that's in
[1:00:44] the church but in the lady
[1:00:47] ofan he was on the outside in other
[1:00:50] words every age you know he's talking
[1:00:52] every age it was in the church it was
[1:00:54] speaking to the of the spirit in the
[1:00:55] church and the last one he's outside the
[1:01:00] church now you can like this or lump it
[1:01:02] I don't care because it's truth the
[1:01:05] first sermon I preached in this
[1:01:08] message was going Beyond man's
[1:01:11] Camp you know the Bible says that he
[1:01:15] suffered without the gate and you know
[1:01:19] what it
[1:01:20] says you know the rest of the scripture
[1:01:23] he suffered without the G it says we
[1:01:25] must go unto
[1:01:28] him if he's outside the gate get your
[1:01:31] scripture if he's outside the door we're
[1:01:33] supposed to be out
[1:01:36] there don't you want to be where he's
[1:01:40] at well you're over here where they're
[1:01:42] shouting Glory Hallelujah but there's
[1:01:43] something wrong cuz he's out
[1:01:48] there the Bible says that we've got to
[1:01:51] go out to him right
[1:01:57] okay but in the lady oan age lady he was
[1:02:01] on the outside knocking trying to get
[1:02:03] back in what a pitiful thing to think
[1:02:06] that the Son of
[1:02:09] God knocking on his own church trying to
[1:02:14] get back
[1:02:17] in now you better start with the Son of
[1:02:19] God being the one that's put
[1:02:22] out don't start with just son of man
[1:02:24] being put out start with Son of God
[1:02:27] being put
[1:02:32] out but yet do you see this whole story
[1:02:35] of what I'm talking about the most
[1:02:36] pitiful side in the
[1:02:37] world is what God can't get back in his
[1:02:41] own church but yet inside the building
[1:02:44] the people are shouting Glory Hallelujah
[1:02:46] wonderful shouting Glory great signs and
[1:02:48] wonders taking
[1:02:53] place
[1:02:55] which one do you
[1:02:59] want do you want to be outside the
[1:03:01] church where God is or you want to be
[1:03:03] inside Church where all the shouting and
[1:03:04] Glory Hallelujah
[1:03:08] is I didn't write the
[1:03:11] story I'm just reminding you of
[1:03:17] it it was a Son of
[1:03:19] God Spirit God we just read back before
[1:03:23] Spirit God
[1:03:26] God in spirit
[1:03:28] form put out of the
[1:03:39] church see that's why brother brandham
[1:03:41] will
[1:03:43] say listen he will say the lady oan age
[1:03:48] is
[1:03:50] ended he will say we're not in the ladyo
[1:03:53] see an age we're in the bride
[1:03:57] age but just remember ever Church
[1:04:00] age was in the bright
[1:04:04] age no matter what age it is that's the
[1:04:06] bright age because see the church it
[1:04:08] doesn't make no difference from the day
[1:04:10] of Pentecost is starting you got to go
[1:04:12] where God
[1:04:13] is but this is the only age that it
[1:04:16] pitifully looks like and sees it as him
[1:04:18] totally put out of his
[1:04:21] church what is put out of his church
[1:04:29] come on let think what's put out of his
[1:04:31] shirt when everything is still there and
[1:04:34] the shouting and the Glory Hallelujah
[1:04:36] and the Great Signs and wonder why is it
[1:04:38] you can't tell them the
[1:04:43] truth why was it brother brandham
[1:04:46] couldn't tell him the
[1:04:49] truth he had the signs and wonders and
[1:04:51] the Vindication to back it up do you
[1:04:54] think they wanted him come on folks get
[1:04:57] a little bit into the story if it hadn't
[1:05:00] been for who was it the the one over the
[1:05:03] businessmen say if it hadn't been for
[1:05:06] the one from who is it Louisiana where
[1:05:08] was from somebody say it because I can't
[1:05:12] remember if it hadn't been for him
[1:05:15] brother Brandon wouldn't have been in
[1:05:16] the businessmen's
[1:05:17] meetings they wanted to put him
[1:05:20] out and he say you put him out you put
[1:05:23] me out and he was the head of
[1:05:28] it
[1:05:30] right back more was one of it but there
[1:05:33] was others into the
[1:05:39] thing it's kind of like I remember the
[1:05:41] story happened brother molim was telling
[1:05:44] about and some of you can remember the
[1:05:47] the lady's name that was a great move
[1:05:49] know I thing and uh they asked her said
[1:05:53] what do you think about brother mine's
[1:05:54] meeting she said never seen nothing
[1:05:56] greater except in my
[1:06:00] own right except in my
[1:06:04] own do you think seriously I'm not
[1:06:08] degrading nobody do you think or Roberts
[1:06:12] thought that brother brandham was above
[1:06:17] him now if you do I I've got some stock
[1:06:19] in alcatra I'd like to sell you out of
[1:06:22] the church at the clothes
[1:06:25] in other words you ain't got sense at
[1:06:27] all oh Roberts thought brother
[1:06:30] brandamore would be sitting under
[1:06:34] him he was getting thousands of Miracles
[1:06:37] and signs and wonders and brother Brown
[1:06:39] getting this a
[1:06:40] handful did brother brandham say that do
[1:06:44] you need that
[1:06:48] quote that brother around and said that
[1:06:50] about all
[1:06:53] Roberts
[1:06:54] well why don't we go with all
[1:06:58] Roberts oh it's dead now well you got a
[1:07:01] good one don't
[1:07:04] you but what about this lady you see an
[1:07:06] age what about a
[1:07:10] situation that's the burden on my heart
[1:07:12] to think of because I've had it there
[1:07:13] for 40 50 years it's burdened
[1:07:16] it why you can't explain people to God I
[1:07:20] mean people about
[1:07:22] God
[1:07:25] I was talking to a man one
[1:07:27] time and I told him I said your problem
[1:07:31] is your
[1:07:35] gift brother dony to tell you about a
[1:07:37] certain man he knows if we talked about
[1:07:40] the reason he's not in this church today
[1:07:42] is because he's got a gift the man has
[1:07:45] in his life that'll
[1:07:49] work but he don't see it working in
[1:07:51] anybody
[1:07:52] else
[1:07:58] so why would he go with anybody else he
[1:08:00] goes by himself lives like the devil
[1:08:03] because God can't be mad at him he's got
[1:08:05] a
[1:08:12] gift he Church the burden has been on my
[1:08:14] heart for all these years about the
[1:08:16] Bride of Jesus
[1:08:20] Christ that you're so easily deceived
[1:08:27] I told you we sat one night and and this
[1:08:29] man preached a whole message and all
[1:08:31] that was totally wrong and the people
[1:08:32] was certain ones was running their
[1:08:35] aisles shouting Glory
[1:08:38] Hallelujah and the next day I
[1:08:41] said but he was
[1:08:43] wrong and never come back to
[1:08:47] church now you think I'm a nasty dirty
[1:08:50] old guy don't
[1:08:52] you I tried to save their
[1:08:59] souls I became an enemy to a man till he
[1:09:02] wouldn't even speak to
[1:09:05] me because I pulled his church out of
[1:09:09] polygamy that they were already talking
[1:09:13] about and I'm not telling it wrong
[1:09:16] telling it right they were already
[1:09:17] talking about who the women were to go
[1:09:19] home
[1:09:22] with
[1:09:24] and they asked me to speak in a
[1:09:26] Minister's
[1:09:28] meeting and I'm just plain as I can be I
[1:09:31] said why would you want 10
[1:09:35] wives I said you got a left demon on
[1:09:40] you until that man died right before he
[1:09:43] died I called him on the
[1:09:45] phone and his wife went and told him
[1:09:47] said brother Dale's called he said
[1:09:49] brother who I can hear him on the
[1:09:51] phone he come to home who is is this I I
[1:09:55] said brother Dale you know that used to
[1:09:57] be your
[1:09:58] brother oh oh brother
[1:10:02] Dale and I pulled a whole church two of
[1:10:05] them as a matter of
[1:10:07] fact out of
[1:10:10] polygamy but I become their
[1:10:14] enemy I'm sorry I'm not sorry for
[1:10:17] telling the
[1:10:18] truth I'm sorry really that I hadn't
[1:10:21] been
[1:10:22] harder about
[1:10:24] it because people are not going to
[1:10:27] listen to you
[1:10:28] anyway like just talking about it now
[1:10:31] what are you going to
[1:10:32] do we're in the end time when the
[1:10:34] anointing is poured out
[1:10:39] that's we're in the end time when great
[1:10:41] signs and wonders can take place even in
[1:10:44] churches that don't believe in the
[1:10:46] Virgin birth don't believe in brother
[1:10:47] brandom don't believe in one God don't
[1:10:49] believe the truth they're in polygamy
[1:10:51] they're in all kind of things you said
[1:10:53] don't worry yes it
[1:10:59] does if a person has ever heal God does
[1:11:02] a healing ain't nobody can heal the
[1:11:04] devil can't and you're sure can't and I

[1:11:44] me but
[1:11:47] listen you said no brother Dale it was
[1:11:49] the son of man that was put out I've got
[1:11:52] some more in here
[1:11:54] that we'll get back and you he'll keep
[1:11:56] talking about the Son of God being put
[1:11:59] out of his
[1:12:02] church
[1:12:05] see the Son of God is the holy
[1:12:09] spirit Spirit God that's right and he's
[1:12:12] on the outside of the church trying to
[1:12:13] get back in but he's on the inside the
[1:12:15] church Healing The
[1:12:19] Sick that can't be
[1:12:22] comprehended but are you going to tell
[1:12:24] me it ain't
[1:12:26] true are you going to be blind enough to
[1:12:29] tell me that that's not
[1:12:32] true that that's not
[1:12:35] happening if God comes right over there
[1:12:37] and heals one person God done the
[1:12:39] healing
[1:12:40] right yeah but he can't get in that
[1:12:46] door is he
[1:12:51] knocking I've been around I've been back
[1:12:53] there when they preached that I stand at
[1:12:56] the door knock is God trying to get into
[1:12:58] your
[1:12:59] heart but that's not just trying to get
[1:13:02] into your heart it's trying to get in
[1:13:03] the
[1:13:04] church and the church is when that put
[1:13:07] him
[1:13:08] out the church it claims him as their
[1:13:11] savior their healer their all in
[1:13:13] all and yet they've put him out let's
[1:13:16] read some things about what it is but
[1:13:18] I'm going to read this cuz where we
[1:13:19] won't get lost on it so we'll we'll read
[1:13:22] one where you won't get lost on what I'm
[1:13:24] talking about and you think I'm leaving
[1:13:26] the son of man out of it so we'll read
[1:13:29] one right here go ahead the message
[1:13:31] called the
[1:13:32] trial
[1:13:34] 1964 and
[1:13:39] look now what did he promise to
[1:13:41] vindicate himself in a
[1:13:43] man a human
[1:13:46] flesh like he did to
[1:13:48] Abraham brother randam right in a human
[1:13:51] flesh like he did to Abraham that man
[1:13:53] that stood out there talking to Abraham
[1:13:55] the flesh man outside wasn't
[1:13:58] God mzc was inside the man right so
[1:14:02] brother brandham is not God we're not
[1:14:03] going that route we're going look when
[1:14:06] the son of man it would be the son of
[1:14:08] man not not not not not Son of God now
[1:14:11] the Son of
[1:14:13] God in a son of
[1:14:18] man so God was using brother brandham
[1:14:22] and he was out of the
[1:14:25] church
[1:14:29] right we can look at
[1:14:31] that we can look at him being put out
[1:14:34] cuz you got where he couldn't go
[1:14:39] nowhere but what about God had already
[1:14:42] been put out of the
[1:14:46] church I just reading that with son of
[1:14:48] man so we just make sure you don't think
[1:14:50] it I'm just I'm just putting this on in
[1:14:51] one thing no
[1:14:53] because in the last days it was Son of
[1:14:55] God in a son of
[1:14:57] man to bring the message we'll get back
[1:15:01] to the AR where brother R said I am not
[1:15:04] the son of
[1:15:05] man he said I'm a son of man he said I
[1:15:09] wish you could get that straight the
[1:15:11] seventh angel messenger is not God
[1:15:16] Amen all right but
[1:15:21] look on the message Jehovah in 1962
[1:15:24] which would be number seven and we
[1:15:26] realize that the Pentecostal Church in
[1:15:29] the last
[1:15:30] days is the lady oan Church
[1:15:34] age the only one that Christ would put
[1:15:38] out of the church standing knocking
[1:15:40] trying to get back in he said God be
[1:15:47] merciful what was put out that would be
[1:15:50] talking about son of
[1:15:52] God
[1:15:53] go ahead number eight the
[1:15:57] trial and he said the seven Church age
[1:15:59] which is the L in in church age well we
[1:16:01] would admit that this is the Lady of in
[1:16:03] age congregation says amen remember he
[1:16:06] the word was put out of the
[1:16:12] church it's not the
[1:16:15] spirit to be put out of the church it's
[1:16:18] the
[1:16:19] word but just remember in final analysis
[1:16:22] God has to go where his word
[1:16:25] is so his word is
[1:16:29] outside okay remember he the word was
[1:16:32] put out of the church that's right put
[1:16:34] out of the church and he was on the
[1:16:36] outside trying to get back in I stand at
[1:16:37] the door knock brother around knock and
[1:16:39] and all like that noce th not that
[1:16:41] you're miserable blind
[1:16:43] naked what about what God is saying to
[1:16:48] them and don't know it he was on the
[1:16:50] outside the word what is it our
[1:16:54] Traditions our Methodist Baptist
[1:16:57] Presbyterian Pentecost Trad Traditions
[1:17:00] has rejected the word of God
[1:17:04] Amen and he can have no more corpor no
[1:17:07] Corporation nowh everybody is hands off
[1:17:11] of
[1:17:12] it and want to call it an evil
[1:17:16] spirit and you understand that Jesus
[1:17:18] said in the last days before the coming
[1:17:19] of the end time that he would be
[1:17:21] revealed as son of man
[1:17:23] not Son of God and that fulfills Malachi
[1:17:26] 4 and all these other Promises of
[1:17:29] Abraham the life sign that Abraham
[1:17:31] receive who was waiting for a coming son
[1:17:34] God revealed in a human be
[1:17:37] being and Jesus said as it was in the
[1:17:39] days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[1:17:41] coming of the son of man so do you won't
[1:17:44] misunderstand me and accuse me of
[1:17:46] putting brother brandom out of it just
[1:17:49] remember I'm putting him right where
[1:17:51] he's supposed to be right
[1:17:54] the word was put
[1:17:56] out but they
[1:18:00] wanted brother brandham to
[1:18:04] come am I right in his early Ministry is
[1:18:08] that identical to the Lord Jesus in
[1:18:11] Jesus's early
[1:18:14] Ministry they wanted him to come as
[1:18:16] signs and wonders right but the word had
[1:18:20] already been put
[1:18:21] out
[1:18:26] you said well no no they read it every
[1:18:30] day your
[1:18:32] Traditions your things see goes into
[1:18:37] this ecclesiastical look at the next
[1:18:39] let's do number nine then I'll quit
[1:18:41] reading CU I got a whole slew in here if
[1:18:43] you doubt me on it then uh one I like I
[1:18:47] I got one in here in a minute where he
[1:18:49] where he said said he he spewed us out
[1:18:51] of his mouth
[1:18:53] and the next statement was and we spewed
[1:18:56] and they spewed him
[1:19:00] out he spewed them out they spewed him
[1:19:04] out look the Bible said he would be put
[1:19:07] out of the church and the seventh Church
[1:19:09] age he would be put out of the church
[1:19:11] it'll go completely black is that the
[1:19:14] way the church Ages were
[1:19:15] Dro right where does it black out it
[1:19:19] goes into this ecclesiastical system
[1:19:23] into this ecumenical council World
[1:19:25] Council of churches she he has put
[1:19:28] completely out his word they can't agree
[1:19:31] with
[1:19:33] it you know they can't they can't even
[1:19:36] agree in their own little local groups
[1:19:39] how are they're going to agree and that
[1:19:40] you don't think about the people of this
[1:19:42] message how that there's so many
[1:19:44] different groups that won't even agree
[1:19:46] with each other and they got one message
[1:19:48] to do it
[1:19:50] by okay
[1:19:53] they can't even agree in their own
[1:19:54] little local groups how they going to
[1:19:56] agree in that so they take another mark
[1:19:59] of the beast an image unto the
[1:20:03] Beast what about
[1:20:05] people that are shouting Glory
[1:20:10] Hallelujah and God is among them doing
[1:20:13] signs and
[1:20:14] wonders and yet the people's already
[1:20:16] taking the mark of the
[1:20:19] beast come on that's why you got your
[1:20:23] anointed ones and remember in the
[1:20:25] Bible if a man give you a sign and it
[1:20:28] come to pass you're supposed to believe
[1:20:30] him that's one scripture another
[1:20:32] scripture if man gives you a sign and it
[1:20:34] comes to
[1:20:36] pass but he takes you to another God
[1:20:39] you're not supposed to believe and
[1:20:40] what's the rest of that
[1:20:45] scripture the rest of it
[1:20:48] says God sent him among you to try
[1:20:58] you God would do
[1:21:01] that he
[1:21:04] has like I said do you think or Roberts
[1:21:06] would agree that his ministry wasn't
[1:21:09] greater than brother
[1:21:12] brandham what do you think about
[1:21:16] it he didn't close his buildings and go
[1:21:19] with
[1:21:20] him till osbor all of them see that knew
[1:21:29] him see as I said about Jesus they
[1:21:33] wanted him as long as he was a prophet
[1:21:36] and Healing The Sick but when he begin
[1:21:38] to say I and my father one brother Bram
[1:21:41] said and these other things when brother
[1:21:44] brandham come forth preaching what was
[1:21:46] their problem what was against him what
[1:21:48] is it on God's
[1:21:50] generals you ever read the book it talks
[1:21:53] about brother randam and God's generals
[1:21:55] the only one in the book that they
[1:21:56] attacked his Doctrine check
[1:21:59] it what 50 or more people maybe in there
[1:22:03] that he spoke of the only one that they
[1:22:06] attacked his
[1:22:08] Doctrine and see what was their idea
[1:22:10] brother brandham you should have stayed
[1:22:13] with the
[1:22:17] gift
[1:22:19] right you should have stayed with the
[1:22:22] praying the sick said you got out of
[1:22:24] that when you started trying to preach
[1:22:27] the
[1:22:28] word and what did he say he said them
[1:22:31] people don't
[1:22:34] understand right he said the healings
[1:22:38] and signs and wonders would only get the
[1:22:39] attention to people where they listen to
[1:22:41] the
[1:22:44] word
[1:22:47] right you say they've got signs and
[1:22:50] wonders here the spirit's moving among
[1:22:52] them
[1:22:54] Glory you know the only thing I've ever
[1:22:56] said about
[1:22:58] that you said when brother so and so is
[1:23:00] preaching I can shout well you mean you
[1:23:02] can't shout when the truth is being
[1:23:04] preached but you can shout when error is
[1:23:06] being preached come
[1:23:09] on I'm not mean I'm just
[1:23:15] truthful is it
[1:23:21] right
[1:23:23] yes but I just feel so good why brother
[1:23:25] so and so is preaching well go
[1:23:28] on you're hindering me and I'm hindering
[1:23:30] you go with
[1:23:32] them I'm not trying to run nobody off
[1:23:35] but this church was never built on
[1:23:36] trying to get anybody to come to
[1:23:39] it I called a man the other day when I
[1:23:42] got through talking to him for about two
[1:23:44] seconds I wish to God I had never called
[1:23:47] a
[1:23:51] man
[1:23:56] I'm sorry that I called
[1:23:58] him that's why I'm like I am folks if
[1:24:01] you leave you're supposed to come tell
[1:24:03] me why you
[1:24:06] leave I'm not supposed to call you up
[1:24:09] try to find out why you
[1:24:11] left you're supposed to come tell me why
[1:24:13] you're leaving can I quote brother
[1:24:17] brand you have no right to leave a
[1:24:21] church this is not them days of
[1:24:23] spiritual husbands that we were down in
[1:24:25] Athens Georgia with years ago of trying
[1:24:28] to make you go to a church I'm just
[1:24:29] telling it like it
[1:24:31] is brother Brown says you have no right
[1:24:34] to read leave a church except it be over
[1:24:37] a
[1:24:43] Doctrine I didn't say that your Prophet
[1:24:48] did but you see I don't make those
[1:24:51] statements to lamb B
[1:24:54] you I've never felt bad at anybody
[1:24:57] that's left I've never said anybody
[1:25:00] that's left here left the
[1:25:09] word because that's not up to me it's up
[1:25:12] to you to go where God leads you to
[1:25:19] go but you say but you turn right around
[1:25:23] and say but you go after the
[1:25:27] anointing and you leave the word right
[1:25:30] is it
[1:25:34] true can you shout over Arrow when you
[1:25:37] can't shout when the truth is being
[1:25:50] preached do you you understand how that
[1:25:53] it was the son of God that was put out
[1:25:56] of the
[1:25:58] church then Here Comes brother Brown
[1:26:00] alone they had already denominated they
[1:26:04] had already split they' already pulled
[1:26:06] apart and all kind of denominational
[1:26:09] situations oness two this three this
[1:26:12] fourness is
[1:26:14] whatever and then brother brandham comes
[1:26:16] on the
[1:26:17] say and he's welcomed in the beginning a
[1:26:20] little bit because of the gift and the
[1:26:21] ministry reason it
[1:26:23] thing but when he begin to lay it down
[1:26:25] and begin to
[1:26:27] preach they gradually begin to walk away
[1:26:29] from
[1:26:34] him
[1:26:37] why because they had already put the
[1:26:40] word out before he started preaching
[1:26:44] listen if you can't agree whether it's
[1:26:46] Trinity or not if you can't get that
[1:26:49] straight or predestination or or
[1:26:52] eternal hell and thing the Bible said
[1:26:55] that in the faith of the
[1:26:58] fathers do you see what brother randam
[1:27:00] is saying they turned down this word
[1:27:04] this word never taught a
[1:27:07] trinity they never taught those
[1:27:10] doctrines they already had them
[1:27:12] doctrines before Brother brandom come on
[1:27:14] the
[1:27:15] scene they had already put the word
[1:27:21] out
[1:27:22] can we do the
[1:27:30] same and we put the word
[1:27:34] out but yet we want the god in do you
[1:27:41] understand there is nobody to put up a
[1:27:44] sign we don't want God in this
[1:27:47] church but by our Creeds and our dogmas
[1:27:50] and ideas
[1:27:54] is God in the church or outside the
[1:27:58] church we ain't even concerned about son
[1:28:00] of
[1:28:02] man cuz they'd already rejected God
[1:28:04] before brother brandham ever come on the
[1:28:06] scene that's what he
[1:28:11] said because come on he started out
[1:28:13] preaching against what they was
[1:28:17] doing
[1:28:20] right 40s
[1:28:23] that he was rebuking the
[1:28:34] Pentecostals see we can turn him out and
[1:28:36] he can be outside the church and we can
[1:28:38] be inside shouting Glory Hallelujah now
[1:28:40] answer me the one question and I'll
[1:28:43] quit when the people when Titus come
[1:28:45] into Jerusalem the people run back into
[1:28:48] the temple right what was they doing in
[1:28:50] the temple
[1:28:56] what was they doing in the temple first
[1:28:58] off they thought that's where God was
[1:29:00] right the reason it went which is inside
[1:29:03] they wouldn't sitting there we don't
[1:29:04] know what we doing we they was in there
[1:29:07] Glory Hallelujah we are the people of
[1:29:10] God he's not going to let them attack
[1:29:11] this Temple because we are the people of
[1:29:13] God and we're in the temple of God and I
[1:29:16] feel the
[1:29:19] anointing uh may I remind you
[1:29:25] about Moses and Aaron and
[1:29:29] them and the anointing was actually on
[1:29:32] some of those people that was against
[1:29:37] Moses where did Pharaoh's men get those
[1:29:41] snakes if you think there's not
[1:29:44] anointings and
[1:29:48] things
[1:29:50] right you haven't listened to the
[1:29:53] message anointing anointed ones the end
[1:29:55] time
[1:29:59] lately the genuine baptism of the Holy
[1:30:05] Spirit anointing the
[1:30:08] people and they've rejected the
[1:30:13] word he doesn't quit anointing them
[1:30:15] because they rejected the word he keeps
[1:30:18] anointing them until it's finished and
[1:30:21] then to judgment they will find
[1:30:27] out
[1:30:29] right because may I quote the
[1:30:34] scripture is it not so that it's a
[1:30:37] judgment they will say
[1:30:39] preachers have not I cast out Devils
[1:30:42] have not I healed a
[1:30:46] sick and he'll say depart from me I
[1:30:50] never knew you
[1:30:54] and the guy over on the other side he
[1:30:56] saids
[1:30:58] Lord I've never been worth nothing ain't
[1:31:01] never done nothing for you but one day
[1:31:04] Lord you cross my
[1:31:07] path and I deserve
[1:31:12] hell said you change
[1:31:14] that is that just a
[1:31:20] story
[1:31:23] no
[1:31:24] musicians is that just a story that we
[1:31:33] tell Christ could be outside the church
[1:31:36] yeah we got communion excuse me yeah to
[1:31:39] pull the thing up we got
[1:31:41] communion could it be that Christ could
[1:31:43] be outside of this little church in
[1:31:48] Lula course I know what everybody says
[1:31:52] no cuz I'm in
[1:31:57] here I'm not dirty I'm just
[1:32:01] straight if you are in here and God's
[1:32:04] out
[1:32:05] there you're supposed to go out
[1:32:14] there we're supposed to go out under
[1:32:18] him well bless God you're just trying to
[1:32:20] run me off
[1:32:22] I ain't never tried to run nobody
[1:32:26] off but I've always tried to be
[1:32:32] truthful I preach it like it is to give
[1:32:36] my
[1:32:37] family my children my Offspring and you
[1:32:40] that listen an opportunity to hear God's
[1:32:45] word as best as I can find it and preach
[1:32:48] it and never make it a lopsided one side
[1:32:51] of a fire
[1:32:58] right is it not
[1:33:02] true I'm quoting right have to from
[1:33:05] somebody else but is it not
[1:33:07] true that when brother brandham said
[1:33:10] that woman to die at 2:00 orever what it
[1:33:13] was you know
[1:33:16] right and they had a
[1:33:19] meeting and in the meeting they
[1:33:21] prophesied Di and then she's not going
[1:33:24] to
[1:33:25] die is it not true you've heard the
[1:33:27] story told Billy Paul went to his
[1:33:31] daddy and he said Daddy they had the
[1:33:33] meeting and said they prophesied and
[1:33:36] listen he said it was the spirit of
[1:33:43] God he said but Billy ain't God ain't
[1:33:47] spoke to
[1:33:48] me she died right on that time
[1:34:03] anointings I have to say what brother K
[1:34:05] Atkin said that time my life he said
[1:34:07] brother you told the truth he said if
[1:34:09] anointing is built upon anointing he
[1:34:11] said brother Dale he said me and you
[1:34:14] ain't much
[1:34:16] anointed I had to agree with him you
[1:34:19] know I had to say you're right because
[1:34:22] there not much anointing you know I have
[1:34:25] to agree to that all right let's stand
[1:34:28] together we're going into the communion
[1:34:30] and foot washing and I just hope you go
[1:34:34] home and think about what it said but
[1:34:36] the way that it's said and the love that
[1:34:38] I've sent it in for you to try to get
[1:34:41] you to see who you are and where you're
[1:34:46] at and what's going on in your
[1:34:50] life
[1:34:53] don't never place it on
[1:34:56] gifts and signs and
[1:35:00] wonders right was it not the prophet
[1:35:04] that said someday I'll show you even the
[1:35:06] gifts that he used he said someday I'll
[1:35:08] show you that that wasn't
[1:35:13] right why did he put everything he had
[1:35:16] on the
[1:35:20] word what does the word say for have
[1:35:24] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:35:26] delivered unto you let the Lord Jesus
[1:35:28] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:35:29] took
[1:35:30] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:35:33] broke it and said take eat this is my
[1:35:35] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:35:37] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:35:40] also he took the cup when he had s say
[1:35:42] it this cup is the New Testament in my
[1:35:45] blood this do you as often as you drink
[1:35:47] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[1:35:50] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:35:53] you do sh the Lord's death till he come
[1:35:55] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:35:57] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:35:59] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:36:01] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:36:04] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:36:05] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:36:07] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:36:09] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:36:12] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:36:14] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:36:17] and many sleep for we would judge
[1:36:20] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:36:22] when we are judged we are chasten to the
[1:36:25] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:36:27] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:36:29] when you come together to eat tarry one
[1:36:32] for another and if any man hunger let
[1:36:35] him eat at home that you come not
[1:36:37] together under
[1:36:39] condemnation the rest will I set in
[1:36:41] order when I come let's just take a few
[1:36:44] moments and pray silently before the
[1:36:46] Lord before we get into the communion
[1:36:50] part
[1:37:10] father you just make us all
[1:37:12] worthy to be the partakers of this part
[1:37:16] that's been delivered unto us you told
[1:37:19] us to do it until you return and we know
[1:37:22] for certain that you're not completed in
[1:37:24] your returning yet so we keep on taking
[1:37:27] communion just have your way with us
[1:37:30] sanctify the people and the
[1:37:34] partakers the food the
[1:37:38] things make it all for you and your
[1:37:40] honor we love you and we thank you in
[1:37:44] Jesus
[1:37:48] name the Bible said he took bread and
[1:37:50] blessed it father we thank you this has
[1:37:53] been made for this day and we thank you
[1:37:55] for that the hands that made it for us
[1:37:57] and now we just ask you we know it's not
[1:38:00] your body and we know it's not the word
[1:38:03] but we know that it's in
[1:38:05] representation of the word and the body
[1:38:08] so we just ask you to sanctify this as
[1:38:11] we eat it and we ask you to just make us
[1:38:14] to be what you want us to be in the
[1:38:17] Kingdom forgive our sins and cleanse us
[1:38:19] sanctify this food to the the
[1:38:21] nourishment of our bodies and because we
[1:38:23] know that it'll be doing that we love
[1:38:25] you and we thank you in Jesus
[1:38:38] name what a great time and understanding
[1:38:41] that we could have of what it is to
[1:38:44] about the communion and to not be so
[1:38:48] confused over
[1:38:50] something that would be make us to be to
[1:38:53] a point that we think we're right but
[1:38:56] we're
[1:39:02] not help us to understand as my
[1:39:11] prayer they started this out in the
[1:39:14] beginning and it'll be the last thing I
[1:39:17] hope that we're doing when the change
[1:39:20] comes because then we just step right
[1:39:22] over to the marriage supper and we'll
[1:39:24] just continue what we're
[1:39:27] doing what a wonderful
[1:39:30] opportunity you shall know the truth and
[1:39:32] truth shall set you free
[1:39:36] amen father we thank you for this wine
[1:39:38] as went through the process now getting
[1:39:40] better each day we ask you to just
[1:39:43] sanctify the wine in us with it we know
[1:39:46] it represents your blood for us we know
[1:39:49] it represents that the bread that we eat
[1:39:51] represents the word and we know that the
[1:39:54] the wine that we drink represents the
[1:39:56] spirit of God to Quicken that word it'll
[1:39:59] be natural blood cells created by eating
[1:40:02] and partaking of this and father make
[1:40:04] sure that it's spiritual to us also we
[1:40:07] love you and we thank you in Jesus
