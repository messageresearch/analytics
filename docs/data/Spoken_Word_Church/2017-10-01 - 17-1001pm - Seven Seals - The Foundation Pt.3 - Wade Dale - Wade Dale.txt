everything about it we've got your Bibles turn to the Book of Revelations where we've been reading revelations 10 and we'll get started on we're still on the foundations that all right but if you don't have a strong foundation somewhere along the line your house is gonna fall down so we're gonna have a strong foundation and we'll just bring a few things out if I can find the top of this thing I like this because it keeps that board from moving okay revelations 10 verse 1 through 7 way of announcements just remember everybody know now June's mom passed away Tuesday at 2:50 in the afternoon so just keep the family prayers like I said there'll be no service there'll be no any kind of memorial service at the moment but maybe later on but that'll be determined by the family so just honor

some of you are already making plans to go and I appreciate that I need all the support I can get and there was something else on my list when I find it oh now for the next couple of months if any of y'all want to go into Sunday School class and listen to somebody different we're going to I'm not gonna take a break but I told him in Sunday School class this morning that that there's always an interval you know it in the 6th chapter I mean in the 6th and the seals there are six seals and then there's a break then there's a seventh seal in the church ages there was six ages and then brother branham come in and preach the ten virgins and he kind of there was a gap in those so we're gonna stop at the sixth seal because I want to catch up up here with them and not have the strain of teaching it down there going into the seventh seal so I'm just gonna stop and let Louise take a couple of Sundays and let Bob take a couple of Sundays and who's ever out of the guy yes a couple of Sundays who is it Ryan yeah down with all the girls let him take a couple of Sundays so Feeny you want to go hear something new you can go down there to the Sunday School class and listen to them for a couple of months and give us time to catch up up here if that's all right hey man so how it gives them a chance to the guys and sisters in the sunday-school class don't have to listen to me come up here and repeat myself so well we we want you to pray for them that I told told them this morning we've got five me brother Dale Aaron Bob and Louise you got five four minutes here that was real good Wednesday night you the boy that was simple but you know what I got something out of wins you know if you don't get something out of a service you basically fell asleep and you didn't wake up and you're still asleep though you're awake but I never thought how that they even the witness of Jonah went with those guys to Joppa you know and and there was another witness that we didn't even think of in the Bible but that's that onion peel that's that's why I was saying about the seals the seals has a it has a meaning and then there's another layer and there's a natural happening then there's a spiritual happening then there's a supernatural happening so you've got different layers but the same onion peel now you can't start peeling bananas and you're supposed to be peeling onions you supposed to be peeling onions you peel that onion peel back then you get something every time you come to church so now that we know that we've got everything set up so far let's turn the revelations 10 verse 1 let's bow our heads before we get started tell me father Lord you surely are here with us today father because I believe we all brought our little lick of fire and I believe during the song service and all the things that we've done that we prayed we've done we've done all the duties of the church took up the offering prayed the prayer face for the sick now we pray Lord that you'll be with us in the further 'men of the service that you'll take control that you'll be the one that does the speaking in the hearing father we ask you Lord to bless the ones that are not here for many things that hinder people from coming to church father but we pray that you just clear those back in that that they'll be able to come on Lord's service father we ask that you just be with the missionaries on the foreign fields we always think about them Lord because our self have been there a few times and they give them their fruit for their labor and the things that they do Lord may it be for your kingdom just be with us today Lord may this be for your kingdom and your honoring Lord today Lord just take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name Amen and we are taking communion this afternoon so I want you to remember that Revelation is 10 verse 1 being first Sunday so I'll try not to be so I've been trying to keep another hour so it's not been too bad and I saw another mighty angel come from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head his face was it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire he had in his hand a little book open and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice it's when a lion roar and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein and what brother Dale talking about this morning we know who that is then that's the Creator God a man who created heaven and things that say and you know what he's not a things down here he just said the mighty angels come down all right so he come down here and we know the Prophet said that the seventh angel is on the earth at the time of that coming alright and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever he created heaven and the things that therein therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein he covered every bit of it that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound and we're gonna we're going to try to tie that in this afternoon and then move on to another subject in this foundation the mystery of God should be finished as yes declared to his servants the prophets now let's go to Ephesians four now that says the servants the prophets not servant the prophet it takes all the prophets to build the body it takes all the prophets take all the prophets out of the Bible and you have no Bible okay and like brother Dale said this morning the Prophet is is a prophetic person that speaks the mind of God all right so let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace into the hearers and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption that you may be seated in the Lord I just blessing to the reading of the word and just kind of settle back and let's see what we can get into this will be foundation part three and we'll get in back into the chart in a minute and try not to make it look so messy I didn't know it looks so messy though I looked over this morning and saw it over there but well maybe try to clarify some things today but I want us to see in this foundation I want us to see why that the Prophet did what he did at the time he did it because remember all prophets come at the time that they're needed Paul didn't come when Irina was needed no Paul came and then Iranians came when Paul's message not Paul's message but when the people started diluting the message of Paul God brings up an arrhenius and then when when man gets in and starts denominating or tearing apart anybody's message all the messengers when they start tearing up God raised up another prophet no man but we know in the end time will see that this prophet in Malachi 4 has got two things he's got to do now the other ones like we were talking about last Sunday the other prophets down through the church ages they had one message they had one job to do bring a message what sound a trumpet a mess sound a trumpet either pronounce judgment or grace because remember when the Prophet hits the earth there's a war stars what a spiritual war not a natural war a spiritual work of the Prophet in other words comes in the place of God being on earth he comes and brings a message from God to the people they either accept it or they reject it when our same thing went with Paul Irena smartin all the way down to the end time but we come to this messenger Malachi 4 and if you'll pull it up we'll read these just to recap and then we'll kind of start today on what I want to what I want us to see now this comes from the layout of Sein church age now this messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelation is 10 7 see you got to take these two scriptures and you got to pull them apart then you got to bring them together alright cuz there's two things according to the prophet there's two things he's gonna do one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the father's no we talked about that Sunday and we'll draw it again up here at number 2 he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals as we were talking before remember the the rolled-up scroll this is your seal this is not the seal this is the seal the seal had to be broke so you could see what was inside of it that all right that sealed the sealed this is the wild horse riders Antichrist and he rides off when he does there's a thunder that opens up what's underneath that seal all right remember we were talking about the the boxcar sure the seal is important but the seal if that seal stays on there doesn't matter if there's millions of dollars worth of say we wanted to send it to Puerto Rico today and we send a container of food to feed those people and one and a man keeps it sealed a man says no there's a seal on it you can't have what's inside well then people will literally die unless that seals broke do you understand what I'm saying a man I'm not talking about natural now unless that seals broke whatever's inside is not going to be brought out and then it will remain a mystery and down to the church ages that has remained a mystery but now according to Malachi 4 and revelations 10 7 this prophet is to do two things and the second one he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders now watch he didn't say the mysteries of the seven seals first he said reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers exactly so but consider this also this prophet messenger will be in his nature of manner as were Elijah and John now we know he's the fourth coming he's talked about itself the people of this prophet messengers day will be as they were in Ahab's day and enjoy and we'll cover that in just a minute and since it is only the children whose hearts will be turned by is only children who will listen so look it will only be the children that will listen because the children have to be raised up to a place to where you show as natural adoption you take a child and you raise and train him up to an adult or heading toward adulthood and then you give him responsibilities that all right mmm all right so let's go to faith I like this quote because I believe it's it's it's pertaining to us listen god bless you well tell you just one thing I know I'm holding along but want this one thing I know and I want you to remember there's something fixing to happen remember I told you that there's a step up coming in the church now see these things that you're now seeing are going to be just little things after a while see that's why you go to Paul and Paul said let's leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection he didn't say you raised him he said what in other words used them for a foundation he never said to do away with water baptism no but he said we don't have to preach on water baptism every service we don't have to preach on receiving the Holy Ghost every service now it's got to be hid we know that we know there's different levels but he said there's got to be in other words Paul said there's got to be a group that that goes higher than that that goes up more in same way we're brother branham watch some things are moving I say this by the power of the revelation of Jesus Christ whom I everyone in our doctrine in our baptism we come to a place but there's some key that unlocks something here now he saw the book sealed on seven seals and when the Daniel saw the same we will read it in a minute and when the thunders uttered their voices he said don't write what that was in the scripture but it be revealed in the last days we're at the time were at Kadish and that's 1953 a long time ago and then so he saw something coming and we know for a fact what he was it was that new ministry moving in he just didn't know what to call it it was in that new ministry part he was coming - alright number three let's read this again and I'm gonna condense this I'm gonna read I'm gonna read number nine or paragraph nine and then 27 I read this the whole thing last week but I just want to give you a refresher course questions and answers on the seals then also knowing that right among you things are happening that I just know I know that you don't see it now listen folks I'm not talking to you he's talking to them okay because somebody told me the other day said and said well we're trying we're I'm not talking to you he's talking to them I'm just telling you what he's telling them sitting physically in his congregation that day I know that you don't see it see I'm just positive that you don't see it see and you say brother Brown that's hard thing for you to say that I know it is but look me save this just say this now I suppose this is just taped for ourselves and so forth but let me say this I see that you don't you don't get it and you're not supposed to get it so don't try to interpret anything don't try to put your interpretation to it you'll only get further away now drop down to paragraph 27 you remember all that he went through about radio and all that but watch he left them on out he left them away just like a prophet left the way out David was dead as a hammer if if the Prophet didn't step on the scene and say David you won't die I prayed for you Nathan stood in the gap brother branham stood in the gap there's something was going to happen but he knew that it had to come from a certain group of people because watch now you might may believe that somebody's singing this certain song that might not even be there see but when it actually strikes the crystal that it's supposed to strike then it gives a true interpretation and vindicates it by showing the picture see what I mean so what is he telling them he said to go on with the same simple message in other words I was telling the church today this morning downstairs look we're a special group of people God is dealing with this bride God is dealing with his bride in ways that he's never dealt with his bride before because that group of people has never been on this earth before amen but we're here now this is our time this is our place you're talking about a place that when we realize what we're doing here and what part of this message that we're supposed to bring I was telling them this morning even with the church ages and the seals and all bringing everything together we can talk we can talk we can talk to thing we can talk to Iranian San Martin and even Paul to a certain degree and tell him things and he never knew but not head knowledge we can't it's got to be a revelation called Paul a no real quick if it was a revelation or if it was you talking Paul would know because Paul the Prophet same with brother branham that's why I brother Brad said this he knew that they were saying brother Branham great message and never heard anything like that before but it was not striking the right crystal that is supposed to strike it's supposed to strike somebody and what be and come into fruition come to a manifestation that he was not seeing at that time that's why the seals were for a special group of people it was not for them I'm not saying that he said it you're not supposed to get it I'm not talking to you I'm not talking to you on the internet brother Branham saying that to his group of people okay he said but go on with the same simple message and what happens is people has tried to make it all these different things and you see what in the world the mess it is it's surely become a mess agent no doubt so now let's read number four and then we'll read a couple of scriptures here number four is this the sign of the end sir now what are we looking at now brother Branham preached the message we got it in booking tape and I read where he said we got it in booking tape form and we've read it now for 50 something years amen we've read it in listen for 50 something years and you and I don't say some people may say nothing's happened I say that God's working and bringing people to a manifestation it's just not that manifestation that we're fixing to look at and then where some have went on with the same simple message some has like brother Dale and I were talking another day and it's true there's there's certain times and I'm gonna say this cuz he said it but I'm gonna tell you he said it that there's a certain group even message believers that the preachers preach just enough to keep you safe just enough to keep the Holy Ghost in you you say well you can't come out of me no but you can grieve it I just read that in from the Bible but message is coming to a place to where I don't know something you've got a little bit sideways when somebody said that somebody was preaching a Baptist doctrine that's exactly what it is if you're not preaching if you're not preaching this second part of brother branham's message you're preaching a Baptist dr. Paul dotes do you say man if you won't do I really don't care you're preaching a Baptist doctrine because that's not what that message that he brought is talking about the first part is to what turn us back to the faith of the father's Amen but that's not his message the seventh angels message was to bring the headstone and a Baptist came bringing a headstone sorry the mysteries here number four the mystery here is the mystery a mystery of Scripture is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation people got a revelation people got revelation of this and revelation of that but there's a supernatural part that only a supernatural group of people are going to get hey listen you get mad at me if you want to I don't care they got mad at Jesus when he told them they was of a Baptist faith you of your father the devil I'm not talking about people but I promise you listen folks i I took a quote out of here a brother branham or heat toward the nominations to pieces and I left it out but it's in there he wasn't nice when it comes to the nominations and we shouldn't be either could you know what that's a compromiser it's becoming now to where I am NOT a compromiser I'm not compromising I'm not even compromising with the people in the message not anymore and after all that junk I heard about different you know different things and you say well you're just you're just like brother Dale you know everybody says well you just you know you I don't think we're there enough I don't think we're to the place to where we can say you you are not preaching what Paul preached you know what brother I'm said we'd come to a place where you're not saying what Paul said why can't we stand up and say you're not saying what brother Branham said you're teaching the people wrong on the seals you teaching them wrong on Daniel 70 weeks you're teaching them wrong on the baptism of the Holy Ghost now all we got to do is just believe the message well that's a lie the devil if that's all we got to do I received it through justification sanctification in the baptism the Holy Ghost I was born of a man and a woman and so were you so you're not gonna get it any other way amen if not then God is a respect to a person so now let's read here in Daniel Daniel 2 verse 18 says now watch 1 this is Daniel that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret now remember Daniel is talking about the vision that one of them has the writing on the wall and he's waiting on God doing her to interpret it to him what that they would desire now we'll see we've we've had a writing on the wall we've had a writing on the wall that says what many many tinkle up or sin you better get ready now this is your time to get ready because you have been waiting the balances and found wanting alright then was the secret no let's read the first part what's this that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret that Daniel and his fellow should not perish with the rest of the wives men of Babylon what is God doing God is separating remember God is a segregationist prophet of God said he was he he wanted Israel to stay away from everything but you know what the problem was they all got mingled in together then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision then Daniel blessed the God of heaven Daniel answered and said blessed be the name of God for ever and ever for wisdom and miter his and he changes the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the and the light dwelleth with him Amen so now let's go to first Corinthians 2 verse 7 but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory now remember there's a supernatural element you can there's there's layers to this you can read the Bible all every day of your life and die and go to hell but you can't read the Bible read Revelation because revelation will change you amen so watch which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory now remember brother Branham preached the indictment what he indicted a generation for the second crucifixion of Christ who was he talking to the denomination but God but as it is written I'm not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love him but God have to reveal them unto us by his Spirit for the spirit searches all things you see that it searches all things yea the deep things of God never look the deep things of God are not going to come to you just sitting somewhere under a tree you've got what you've got to search them out and then you've got to assert you got you know the words you've got to want it because remember to me the deep things of God are the most simple things that we can understand how would God make it so deep that out what how would you make it so deep that an illiterate man can get born again how can that happen can't happen for what man knoweth the things of God save the spirit of Man which is in him so in other words in your natural spirit you can't understand God it's contrary to God we've stopped minded this morning there's there's things that that that bombard our minds and controls us yeah it still controls us a little bit we let them control us in our spirit realm not a soul but in the spirit realm we have a lot of things that's that still that we got to get we can't divorce there's no divorce in this message one more time there's no divorce in this message your husband's got to be dead before you can make Christ or what you are you're committing adultery amen now we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is of God we are the very manifestation of God what brother Devils how much this morning we are the manifestation of God on earth we have God has in more feed from all those in war fees brother Dale was talking about he's he morphing into a bride mmm and look we can't do anything but what the Spirit tells us to do that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak so in other words we have something to say but it's not us saying it not in the words which man's wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto Him neither can he know them because they are what spiritually discerned you and I listen we are third pool people amen the second pool was the discernment the third pool was the speaking of the word we should be through and we should be able to discern not by taking somebody by the hand but discern what discern with the spirit that's inside of you whether what somebody's telling you is the truth or not but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges to all things high in the world you think we're going to stand in judgment and go oh I don't know no judgment is sure judgment is true judgment will not fail God cannot say oops you and I can say us but oops it's not in God's vocabulary hey man so we must be able to spiritually judge all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him question but we have the mind of Christ that's the only way we can understand it is to have the mind of Christ is that Alright say ma'am amen so now let's go back to our chart just for a moment because what I want you to see something else that that we were talking about this morning don't collapse again now we were talking about the more draw a bigger one yeah buddy see that Danny can you see that you see it okay sure enough okay if you can't I'll turn it on around a little more but I want us to look how's that there glare that okay all right then remember now you and I you and I are looking at this as the statue of a perfect man which is fine and that's okay we can do that but I want you to see something that how that the Lord lays this in Scripture in two different ways that's why I want you to see that brother branham he tells us that that one seal can tie the entire Bible together so anything now that we look at we can tie back to what we have previously been taught if you've never been taught it how you going to get it that's a background that's that's looking at what you've already seen that's why brother Branham couldn't bring this statue of a perfect man after the seals he had to bring them before because this is to remember this is the faith of the fathers right here and then this is the faith of the fathers alright then you got your gap and then this is the headstone obviously but remember it was rejected and it's gone out of the church he built his church on the Son of God revelation amen this is your seven ages right here seven Church ages if I got that say Amen all right now look where were the seven churches in the Book of Revelations Revelation is one chapter one through Chapter three right is that right revelations one through three is the church ages all right then you've got chapter four I like what I like what I still feasting on what William said about that comma that comma in come past 2000 years so this line right here is going to be revelation 4:1 because remember in the seven churches when the rapture takes place is that right saying ma'am all right now remember we got to be called out of the age and we'll look at that in a minute but revelation is for one didn't watch his brother branham do when he comes in and preaches the breach which is revelations chapter five that all right now watch revelation 6 that's the opening of the seals one through the rest of the chapter cuz remember folks and we'll get to it a little bit later there's only really six seals that has any kind of that has any kind of commentary all right some of you just keep going to sleep that'll be fine with me you're going to sleep right on into the Tribulation Period this needs to be important you need to listen to this revelation 6 verse 1 through whatever is the opening of the seals so the seals weren't to open in the church ages per say we had to be called out of the ages revelations 5 is what Redemption a man are that's the breach between the two now watch this now brother Branham tells us into waters of separation now they've got that one I believe you can pull that one up if you want to I I inserted this one now look how many of you know but where you read the quote how many you know there were seven church ages in the Old Testament right and I can place a few of them but I don't have time that's not what I'm preaching on now all right but we know one thing's for sure the middle of the ages the middle of our ages was right here and that's when church and state married is that all right right going into the Dark Ages what Constantine married Rome proper with Rome spiritual and I use it as a lute very loosely right now brother Branham says here Watch Israel natural and the Gentile Church in spiritual seven Church ages right in the middle I didn't have time to put right here but watch what he says and Israel had seven church ages right in its bloom of its best came a hab and married this idolatry brought in an idolatry in and caused idolatry in Israel the Christian Church did the same thing in the Dark Ages come right in and made writing the same thing and brought our Dollar Tree so the seven churches in the Old Testament the Middle Ages was they having Jezebel remember when church and state married its again or the first time then churches stayed married again in the Gentile so there are seven church ages in the Old Testament and seven in the new now here's the whole thing I want you to see as the continuity of this is not just a pyramid doctrine brother Brown keeps telling us that and it's not because remember these seven church ages you had what you had seven ages well what was the seventh aged in the Old Testament John the Baptist Elijah coming at the end of the age that's not for me Elijah coming at the end of the age to what introduce the headstone John comes at the end of the church ages in the Old Testament to bring what he brings Redemption repent and introduces the head what did the property God do comes at the end of the age and introduces the head so there you got your time for your church ages even in the Old Testament New Testament brought into revelations one through three which is the church ages for one there's a rapture okay revelations five is showing the scene of redemption amen and then revelation 6 is that second part of brother branham's ministry so the ministry of brother branham it covers what all the church ages there's not a doctrine he brought that wasn't in the church ages in his first part of his message of his message right but now the second part light had never shined on that there was never a person preached and broke those seals except Jesus himself and he was rejected and cast away in the church ages right but now at the end of the age we have a prophet comes on the scene stands in the breech and brings a message and that message is the revelation contained in the seven seals which are the thunders that no one had ever looked at before now remember brother Branham also told us he said this Lavis in age is a very short age John's message was six months long John the Baptist message was only six months a great powerful message but it was only six months so it was a great message but what his only concern was introducing the head now what did John do John turned back remember hearts of the children to the father's fathers to the children John did one the property God did the other right all right so he's brought us up to a place so we're not caught in the church ages we got to be it's like Paul said Paul said we we're raptured already sitting in heavenly places and then people go to preaching we're already in the Millennium well hey guess what happens now people in Jamaica are preaching that we're already in the Millennium I told them I said take them to the zoo take them to the zoo put them in with the wine and let's see if that line will weigh down and not give you any problems so how foolish no but look people hang on that doctrine we laugh about these different doctrines but take some people hang their very soul on those doctors so we need to be careful all right so when I look so that's the great plan so we see now that that this is foundation and what was I mean you read the church age book all the major doctrines are in that church age book amen all the major doctrines of this message is in that church age book amen but we got a bit but we got to come up higher than that the call was come up get yourself out of the ages and come up into the headstone which the headstone will read it all while we know that's Christ that's the message of Jesus Christ back in its power in its position because remember the position that the I'm go back again that did I miss the mission of the denominations is just really that right there no right right right there they don't bring the headstone so they're stuck they're stuck in the church age that's why they you gonna go by the grave if you don't because you don't have enough to get all the way out you've got your forty nine seven times seven this is folks this is the Jubilee we've been looking for this is the Jubilee this will be the bride's revival sure they have small revivals in here but this is the bride's revival in the end time you and I have got listen there was no voice of the resurrection in here oh sure people will raise from the dead but they died again this right here this man died but will never die again why because there's where the body change comes from somebody's got to raise up in the lap we got to get off of our this and get into Christ you say I'm doing the best I can keep trying keep trying listen keep listening and don't just say well I don't believe that and just cut it off you go right ahead I'll do your funeral me a brother there one but that's the way it looks now dude this church ages because there was denominations in those churches right penticoff badness methods well I'm telling you you preach this right here then you preach this too you preach a Baptist message but that right there it's what they can't find they can't find that stone why because that stone is a revelation that they've never had before hey man you can live right sisters you can drag your dress to the ground hair whatever men you can say well I've been in this message 30-something years 40 something it doesn't matter until we received that message that message of the opening of the seven seals and in then into the deep things of God into the things that we need to listen there's only gonna be a few that will but you know what I'm dumb enough to believe it sister bail that I'm the one if there's one vowel said don't forget me don't forget I said God's not gonna forget you you got plenty of time you know what you decide whether you have time or not you decide because God's never gonna ask you Mark why'd it take you so long become a Christian you know why cuz y'all ready how long you become Christian you're just answering your own question no God's gonna say there's my son you gonna listen to what he says cuz he's come to a place that I can give him the sword and he can do the work you give some people a sword and they'll kill people with it right the wrong people but you give the sword brother Bramson in a skillful hand a hand of strong faith that's what we got to have we got to have faith that we are going to be raised up out of the church ages that we are going to come through and see the greatest plan of redemption that ever was to be told and that is what to wit the redemption of our body amen now listen some of your older ones some of you younger ones like Joe signs that names like why didn't all people talking about why don't they want body change I get up in the morning at night I run two miles and I need all I want I don't help me you what do you get 50 something years old 60 70 80 these places are hurting you you didn't even know you had that's why we're groaning we're groaning and travailing what together - what - wit the redemption of our body that's what we got to come to you all right so let's go to the next let's go to number five there by alright with that saying man so you had seven churches so you see how you see how parallels all this background that we've been through for all these years brother Adams message came perfect perfect staff step right up the line those messages were never preached out of order those messages were ordained of God it's the only way we're going to get it look spoken words original seed statue of a perfect man all preached before the seals but it's something that we had to have for a foundation to get us to the seals and then he gets to there and he says well this is nothing for you in other words stay back here eats what he told you in your Jackson what he tell junior Jackson stay here and look on this right staying here and look on this what brother brown said I left them and went to Arizona for what to see that and to come back with that man that all right say man I just want to get this is just the background this is just the foundation but I watch number five the breach we read this last Sunday and we're reading in and revealed as the seals break and are released to us then we can see what this great plan of redemption is and when and how it's going to be done it's all hidden in this book of mystery here next time about the Bible it's sealed up with seven seals and so the lamb is the only one who can break them and the whole thing here the seven seals got the mysteries of God from the foundation of the world all sealed up like we were talking about all sealed up in there and revealed by seven different seals that if God willing let him let us pull back those seals and look down through the book and find out what it's all about oh I hope we have a great time there the mystery of redemption is sealed until this book could not be broken until the last angels message the scrolls there we note it was there we knowed it was Redemption we believed it was Redemption all right so now let's go to the breach now see the mystery of the seven sealed book will be revealed at the sounding of the seventh Church ages message see the seventh angel begins to sound and there's the messages wrote out there and we got it and take that book for him he was pretty plain about who who where it was to come from I told him this morning I read a quote last night where brother Brown said please believe my message and he stops he says I mean his message it's his message not mine God corrected him he felt checked he said please believe in my message and then he stopped and he said no it's not my message it's his message hey man so this is all the message this comes straight from God this was not manhandle this comes straight from God so you believe it or not if you want to that's okay you have a free moral agency but look I want to show you - now look in the time that we have had all this teaching remember the teaching that we gave you brother Dale and I both was talking about the the messenger coming at the end of the age Amen you know you had seven you got seven Church agents right all right there by pay attention you had seven Church ages Paul though had to come at the end of the age well what do you come at the NDA of the first age he can't he can't he can't be the message of Ephesus and come at the end of the Ephesian age so he comes at the end of the Pentecostal age Pentecost 50 he comes at the age of Pentecost here is an age of Pentecost right here he comes at the end of the Pentecostals rebukes them and brings his message then hook eye rainiest comes in here at the end of what Ephesus comes and brings this message because when this starts going down there's a messenger brings it back up when this starts going down and it goes down after the messenger is gone some of these messengers like Columbo was dead before the age started but what he preached carried right over on into the age right but now you look here we see that if we have we got Paul Irina's Martin sometimes like in Calamba all the way through now we got would come up to brother Brown now watch let's read a quote him trying to do God a service without being his will 1965 now God hasn't provided an original way to do things and he'll never do it country I told him downstairs God is just he is just constant that's why I can depend on the word that's like independent God he's consistent like I said God never has an oops moment it's always exactly what he says that's how it's gonna be now he promised in the last days that what he would do and it sent them us the message and this message would have the same identification as Elijah had as he lost your head as John the Baptist head turned the hearts of the people not to the denomination but back to the original apostolate fathers back to the word see remember denominations didn't begin until about right here coming to the dark ages then Roman Catholic and then you come into y'all you about they weren't down here the first three ages were pure no dot indoctrination but little things were coming in but what but back to the original Apostolic fathers back to the word how these things have been have indicated how that in the sounding of the last angel revelations 10 in the days of the seventh angel these mysteries that's all been why did the Methodists do this and the Baptist's in the Church of Christ Jehovah Witness all do that the mysteries will be revealed in the last day when the seven angels seventh angels message when he not when he starts out doing this but when he begins to sound his message see not the years in preparation but when he begins to sound the message these mysteries will be revealed and here they are not knowing them and you people are a witness now let's go to work she's faced this press 1965 but remember Abraham wasn't in Sodom he was called out and there was one state and talked to him what brother there was someone this morning and the one stayed and talked to him showed him a sign with his back turned he and Sarah was gonna have the baby that he had waited on him with his back turned he called it God Elohim now that brings to pass today because we have faith and I know this is of God is because this in other scriptures point to this our revelations 10 said in the hour of the seventh angels message when he begins to sound forth his message not in a healing service but the message that follows the healing service amen then all rights amen now number nine let's read it - and then we'll stop and go back for a minute I have heard but now I see 1965 these are all after the seals they right before it God takes him off the scene now we're promised to church age through reformers and we've had them but he promised in Malachi 4 he'd keep his pattern in the last days that would take place to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Apostolic fathers for that very purpose and the church is so broke up in denominations and isms so in the message it's so tore to pieces till it's dead I didn't say that he did you know I told him other day when brother Branham called those denominational churches Raja's he pronounced judgment and they're nothing more than logic go to one and see so much confusion they just whatever they want to do they do it I mean there's no reverence they just completely got away from the Word of God sorry but that's just what it is it's been a carrier it had the word at one time and then he promised in the hour of the seventh angels message the seven seals would be revealed and the mysteries of God would be declared when the seventh angel begins to sound this message not the healing service the message that follows and they said that twice the message that follows the healing service that all right so in other words he did his first part from 47 to 63 he did his first party through the healing campaign he was getting the people's attention God was trying to tell the people listen the difference in William Branham and all those other great ones that he talked about they didn't have a vindicated message behind them there was nothing wrong with all robbers there was nothing wrong with well he had a message behind him because he was in the Bible but you take all the other ones dallying and moody and all them they were great powerful men and there was a lot of healings went on but they didn't have a vindicated message out of the Bible they said you're the one that's going to bring us to this spot so that's what we have we have that message that God gives a one man to bring to a group of people and not for us to just throw it under the under the seat the message that follows remember brother Brown said that was the healing was always the bein on the hook well what was he trying to catch the bait of the hook the bait was the healing service the hook was the message he was trying to get two people to take the message and they didn't to listen they did to a point I'm not belittling no one at all you know that but they're dead and gone they can't help us anymore lot of people why seek either living among the dead that's what the angel told him into cemetary they walked out so we're looking for Jesus's body and that angel said why are you seeking to live in the money bed that's the same way with you and I why are we seeking the living among the dead this message is life it will change your body but not in the years of preparation will it change your body it takes that place we are a that Plus people we are that plus we are that plus didn't bring the bamse we were headstone people well then there's this the headstone no that's the headstone we're heads don't people pray for a revelation but it's the message that follows the healing service so brother Branham comes at the end of what Pentecost again comes remember no mention to the aged Pentecost had the Holy Ghost right he comes at the end and brings his message and then brings his message right over into what there's not another eight search age so what is this message this message is the Eternity brought into time like brother Dale said the seven seals were not preached in one week the revelation of those seals went from 63 to 65 to 2004 to 2014 to 2017 how you gonna stop an eternal word you cannot stop it no what what Laodicean Church age I just want you to see in this foundation the position you're at I'm talking to you I'm not talking to nobody else talking to you I like to give you a quotation of what this angel beast fits and tell you exactly what this angels gonna be would it be alright congregation says amen being that we got a little time I just wrote a little quotation here what I thought the angel of this layout of sin Church age to end it up now he will be at the end of the age now look he couldn't come at the end allowed us there he came at the end of the Pentecostal age to bring his message his first part goes to the church who'da preached in church he didn't come up till about the end about when he started preaching the seals and saying now call you bride he will be at the end of the age like the rest of them like the Bible he'd be at the end of the age not the first of it at the end of it because the angel always comes to rebuke for them what they done to the angel the church allowed to see his write these things to the angel Church Smyrna write these things we've been through this preach meantime see each one is to the angel at the end of the age Paul the end of the age and on down into the age the lap over the end of the age into the age that's what makes it lap like this this laps over here to the angel to the end of that agency picking up right here and made the lap like stair steps going up seven Church ages that cleat actually this is the way the church ages should be drawn because here's here's where the porter comes in here's where the lap over is it's where the messenger comes in because God doesn't abruptly stop you know what he doesn't because of me and you it is for us not him it's for us he brings grace enough that's why I said many times that he brought grace to those Pentecostal people up to a point brothers and sisters but I'm gonna tell you something he don't wink at your ignorance all the time hey man 1977 I believe he quit winking at the Pentecostal ignorance because this message came you sure he was off the scene hold on I got a quote let me read it to you that alright can I read it number 11 I'm gonna read you two excellent now notice quickly now she is at that stage this is birth pains that's why I told them downstairs we'd be talking about bringing a breech birth I went back read birth plans and I believe I ever read that book before they must have printed a new one cuz I read that book 100 times sister Jeannie and I read it again and it's like I've never read it before but you know what I read it with the mentality that we are in that breech we were that birth but watch I'm gonna let him confirming not me she is that that stage beyond - our doubt were in the Laodicean Church age so he tells us right where we are now her messenger is promised in my LaCava fourth chapter he's promised to do it now this is 1965 after the seal the message is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth is to be she's to be delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 so Malachi 4 did not bring us a new new birth still justification still sanctification is still about - the Holy Ghost the Word of God but it was coming under our messenger that birth was coming under a messenger where we're able to one receive more we're beaten to be delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 look in the church world today there's two systems working I think this is where I cut some of this out he was you read birth plans and I promise you you'll see what I was talking about in the church today there's two systems are working now listen real close now I want to see if you're going to say Amen on this there's two systems working in the church world today I'm going to get this off my shoulder and then I have it over with we all know that that's the Word of God and the denominational system there is the two systems at work just as they was Jacob and Esau one after the spirit the other one after the flesh and what is it Esau and Jacob was fighting in the womb of the mother even to the time they were born and so is the denominational and the word fighting one against the other they have been since Luther first brought the first Reformation so this is not new I hope that simple enough that you can understand it now I like this part these men if they pick up this listen Louis if they pick up this and go out with it they can make more sense of it see to bring it to a place you would I just want to lay this seed that hope they make it come to life I believe I'm in that sentence right there number 12 birth pains 1965 it's always been there that's the reason she's bearing birth pains because there there's a fight in her there's an East Hall just a man of the world very religious and oh he's alright good fella clean moral as far as I know of but he don't know nothing about that birthright he's born that way he's shaped that way and Jacob I don't care what he is he wants that birthright he's the spiritual one listen now and them too today is in the womb of the church there's a great big system trying to be formed called the World Council of Churches and from the womb of the church is coming forth to children you just mark my word the world's the word must deliver the word bride church the church has got to be delivered out of her a bride for Christ then that fell asleep in all ages look we'll make up the bride that come out on the world that they come out on like from your feet coming to your head she gets gets greater and more you have to have so we gotta have more as the body grows up so does the body of Christ girl and then finally the head will come to it the head of it will now we notice because it's all weight to the head the head does the turning are the pulling all right now one morning well then we'll make a few comments and then we'll have communion adoption 1960 tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time now when were there ever a time in the history that man manifests the time to deliver all nature nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation while before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out before although all the Old Testament on down there that couldn't have been manifestation it had to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of sons of God coming back now look he's in the headstone to the manifestation of sons of God coming back and the Spirit of God coming into these men men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ to join him in his church together amen I believe that our problem is improper teaching I mean how can you set in a message church for 30 years and say that the seals with just the opening of the horse riders and I just can't see that because we've been well talked and I don't feel I don't feel no greater it actually makes you feel worse that all this time that people's had to - hey listen did I not read your quotes today did I read your quotes from out in space somewhere look those are quotes that are common in the prophets message right common it's not something that I had to read different than you've ever read like birth pains I've never read that book before I don't know where that book came from I just read it with more understanding hey man because remember brother branham I believe he preached a message in that days one thing for sure he preached at different levels because there was denominational people there they was people that was not getting anything at all just like here there's three times three kinds of people in the church to make believe we're nothing believer a true believer you gotta preach to all of them amen listen if you've ever prayed for your family pray for them now if you've ever prayed for your loved ones pray for them now because look the foolish virgin remember didn't have time they knew where the oil was they went to the wise virgins and said give us of your oil they knew weren't with that that in other words they knew where the word was but what did they tell them we don't have in other words let me put it let me paraphrase oh we don't have enough time to get you to the place you need to be yeah go find your own that sounds horrible but listen I don't know if you gonna make it but I know yeah but I know I'm gonna make it yeah okay so be careful we've got to come to a place though that we've never come before we've never walked this way before we have never come to a place where our mentality has got to be totally different even Satan in a message congregation we were sitting one day that was six hundred people in the church right at least six hundred people and this guy this well-known preacher that all we all listened to on one from up north he's preaching away just to worse doctor and I ever heard that Jesus went and gone to the river Jordan we heard that and then we hear this other well-known preacher that some of you listen to online that said that he Adam had to place his liberal seat into Eve the saber well that six hundred well know five hundred and eighty five people got on their feet and screamed hallelujah praise God jumping all over the place that was fifteen of us there we didn't get up we didn't clap our hands you say well y'all just know you know what I'm gonna tell you something we're gonna find out who's right and who's wrong if I'm wrong you'll know it if I'm right you're gonna know it all right Paul walked up one day and he said you will be judged by what I say now I know Paul was a prophet and you're not gonna be just what I say cuz without in other words he got it straight from God we should get it straight from God but we have to have a little help we have to have a prophet Paul was a profit goes remember profit only answers to God profit I don't see how these people in the message are saying they're above brother Branham how he's wrong here and he's wrong here and he's wrong here they must be closer to God than brother Adam boy cuz it's brother Branham in God folks and I'm sorry nothing in between now he turns and gives it to us and we're supposed to teach it right but there's nobody between the profiting God if if brother Branham needed correction God corrected him and that's it period if God had to correct him it mean if he needed correction God corrected him and listen I asked to know how much Antichrist can you be because Satan is created by this great man called God but yet ething seeking beat him look how deceived he is he deceived part of the angels to believe his plan that he being a created being can whip a creator that created him out of nothing you see our deceiving that is that's the same spirit now it's the same devil like we told him in Jamaica it's the same devil just got different names from there to here right but you and I must come to a place to realize and I want us to understand one thing if you think you better than somebody else Jesus never thought he was better than somebody else so that put that put you out of here yeah that's why we must be serviced that's why I like what brother Claude said he said look Rock there's for brotherly kindness is supposed to be right before the headstone comes because you know what brother branham they said he didn't you couldn't tell who his enemies or his friends were now listen I'll promise you one thing give me a few minutes with you and I can tell you who your enemies are because you'll tell me somewhere down the line and I'll tell you the same thing so I'm telling you it brotherly kindness right there is where that headstone come down and Father forgive them for they know not what they do have we ever said that when somebody persecute us or somebody bring something wrong against us says God forgive them they don't know what they're doing they're spiritually blind and spiritual blindness is way worse than natural blindness amen because you know what spiritual blindness you don't know you're blind poor wretched miserable blind and don't know it so we've come to that place here that we see now just recap the rest of this and then we'll we'll have communion we see that there was a message that brother Brown a message but at the end of the age at the end of this Laodicean age there was a message brought that was not different but it is different right same message but more of it amen not a different Bible brother branham this will be something outside nope this will be something so nope wouldn't it be no he just stops them right there it's gotta be right here everything the headstone like brother that's your word the word the word must come back in power like it was when Jesus was here because remember the voice of the resurrection was in Jesus I'm not looking for a rapture I'm telling you again I'm not looking for one it's going to happen but it will never happen till the dead come out of the ground or the Bible is not right the Bible says we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not what prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet of god shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain will be caught up see there so the rapture the rapture is something waiting over there we got to get the dead out of the ground we got to know that death is destroyed you think that bothered him death didn't bother Jesus sure the natural body cried out but he knew his job you and I must know our job is to get a group of people up in to the headstone so that we can see not that we can teach you anything I want you to get that out of your head but remember that scripture I read you in Corinthians that you will search for the spirit searches all things yay the deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of Man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God you can't understand without God being inside you can't understand when we come you can brother Brahim said what the first pull imitate second pole can be imitated right but the third pole cannot be imitated that's the third pole remember I read you the quote I cut it out to this but last Sunday he said realize this is that third pole this is the third pole this is the first and second pole this was getting the people to see the message that was coming not the healing campaign but at the end of his message with what when he begins to sound his message the mystery of God will be finished but it will take a group of people to carry this on brother I'm sitting men that'll take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord so that's our job without it you and I brother branham came in vain if somebody doesn't stand one day and say well I was gonna say this Ruth Kali come out of the ground Robert Tatum come out of the ground Garry we want you here brother Marlo you know what they're that far away that far away that far that far you know what it just takes us believing what's all ready here let's stand to our feet it's already here it's just gotta be broke so that we can what see or understand open the eyes of my heart Lord let me what see you let me see not what's coming what's already here brother Brown said I'm not saying he's coming I'm saying he's here then he is the one that's gonna hey you and I were in that man called Jesus right and when he said Lazarus come forth when he said Lazarus come forth that's right if he'd have said burn Bromstad if he would have said everything everybody come forth he would but you know what he wasn't to fulfill that you and I were to fulfill that he wasn't to fulfill all come out of the ground he brought Lazarus out of the ground but you know what when we bring the dead out of the ground they're not going back in the ground we're not going down we're going up hey man let's bow our head definitely Father we pray Lord it what says been pleasing to You Lord may not be pleasing sometimes this old flesh but Lord may we chew on these words and realize one thing for sure if we don't come to a place then your prophet came and preached all them years for nothing but we know that your word will not return void that it will accomplish everything that it said it would accomplish so now as we stand here as the alive living bride of Jesus Christ we are that we which are alive and remain right now we are preventing and hindering from those coming out of the ground but Lord not very far from now we're gonna see our loved ones again we're gonna see the one just went on and we're gonna have a time all won't it be a time brother jewel that he's talking with the Angels I want I really don't want to talk to the angel I want to talk to the people I know that have went to that other side Lord that your prophet saw and his brother Dale was talking this morning about God having been so real in the garden being a spirit he could still tear the skins well when the prophet went across the curtain of time he stood there and he said I could feel those people they were solid they had feelings so that's what kind of body that we're looking at we're not looking at some spook or some fake something Lord we're looking at a reality we're looking that that's been hitting the word and God I believe now in this time right now today that we will be able to see more of what you're doing not what you're gonna do show us today there's enough power in this room to create a whole universe but we're held by what a bar and a lot of it is our unbelief and I pray father that you would break that break that steel of unbelief I don't believe had you had any hesitation to come out of that tomb that morning on Easter morning I don't believe you hesitated one bit father I believe you came right into that body walked out stepped right out of that grave and said all power and heaven and earth being given unto me well Lord if it's been given unto you then it's been given to us to carry on this great Ministry of Jesus Christ Father forgive us of our sins and our mistakes that we make be with us now Lord and the further man the services would take communion may we remember Lord the last thing you told us to do before you left and that was to take the communion to commune with You Father but also to commune with each other to bring us closer Lord to You Father we pray these things in the lovely name of Jesus Christ amen let's go into the community anybody have a need we'll pray for you but I want you to believe in your seats that's the Gentile way laying on of hands is still in the Bible but it's not the way it's supposed to be brother Branham says it was a tradition that John Wesley started so I don't like traditions out for that too much I want to just believe believe were you sitting if you need to have a connection that's okay but I believe that was a Centurion one time looked right straight at Jesus and he said you are a man of authority and I'm a man of authority whatever you you know I say you know ten thousand go over here or one hundred go over here and they go you know what he was saying he was saying I know you are in a man of authority and whatever you say whatever demon that is that's taking over that servant of mine whatever you say that's what'll happen Jesus said I don't even need to go in your house I mean whatever distance it was it didn't make no difference because the person came running back and said well what time he said well about 11:30 he saw us about the time Jesus said that I said about 11:30 the man got better as a long arm reaching out but he didn't need it he just needed faith to believe that Jesus was a man of authority that's what he believed so let's go into the community Lord bless you till next Sunday take care yourself love the Lord love each other we're a special group of people don't forget that amen to the word you know you think about the closer we're getting to the rapture change the resurrection of things we did not mean that that's the closer we're getting to those that have gone on any problem that thought you or tinnitus ate it because you know won't say something else what about then if we're the prophets somewhere in the 50s 60s he said those people are destined to 20 feet away it'll slant well what that means I don't know but I don't worry about it but you know if you ever thought about that when you raised your hands up and you wave them to God they might be close enough to hold hands with you saw that's just crap well okay I'm just crazy the closer they're getting then maybe we could contact them a little more it might mean they just move right among this one dinner I thought that was what we believed and was waiting for that's why we got the pictures down stars to where we don't have no problems when they're raised to see how a young looking person will be so remember you might have raised your hand a little bit more you know if you enjoyed the message and make sure you tell my brother he enjoys the Lord for the word let's go right on into the communion first Corinthians 11 for I've received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye ye as often as you drink often oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew the Lord's death till he comes or for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge our if our if we judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord then we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home did you come not together under condemnation arrest what I said in order when I come let's just have a moment of silent prayer and just praying one for the other and praying the Lord with leaders and goddess father we thank you for the word that we heard today and we pray that you just bless us with understanding of you that your light would shine in our hearts and life as we go into now to the further minute of their service and taken to the communion we thank you Lord for your grace and your loving to each and every one of us cleanse us and make us worthy to partake of this communion we love you we thank you in Jesus name father we thank you for this bread is made and we ask you to just let it be in order to understand it from that bit we know it's not your blood or body that we're protecting of this day we know it is in representation we thank you we ask you to sanctify the bread and the partakers in Jesus name you know we we don't think too much about life and realities from time uShip but more to think about who we are what we here for we're here for a purpose to end all this up it's been children our lot to finish this bring everything to a conclusion and the brain fourth we did the comb that's left up to us they without us could not be made perfect and then they're waiting for that you know is that saying we might think it odd to think that we can reach out and touch someone well I don't have to worry about that too much I seem like I heard a prophet one day saying that he was standing and somebody reached over and put her hand on his shoulder maybe we could be a little closer than we think right say well if we can't do this we can't do that if we get our mind out of heavenly places to thank sensibly about the word we might find out this is closer than we think father we thank you for this wine has been made and purpose to represent your blood father we ask you to do is just strength upon it as we eat the little piece of bread and drink a little wine Lord tomorrow and be blood cells in our bodies we'll be able to live off of it we thank you thank you for the truth of knowing all what you've given unto each one of us sanctify the wine and the protector in Jesus name come morning walk by the river ah [Music]
