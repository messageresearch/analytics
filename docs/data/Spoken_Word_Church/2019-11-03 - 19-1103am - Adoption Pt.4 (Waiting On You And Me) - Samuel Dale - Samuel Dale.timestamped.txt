[31:57] Lord willing with us in December
[32:01] and preaching forests are the weekend of
[32:03] the the church together and you know
[32:05] that we have two times together or I
[32:07] don't know so remember that one will
[32:09] announce that any other Father we thank
[32:16] you for your grace and your love unto us
[32:18] thank you for everything Lord and we
[32:20] just praise your great name and we honor
[32:22] you and we ask you now that just be with
[32:25] us and coming this Lord you take over
[32:27] the service and just have your way in
[32:29] your that your heart and your love dwell
[32:32] among the people because that's our
[32:34] desire more than anything to see where
[32:36] we're at right now where we've been
[32:38] where we're going is wonderful but where
[32:40] we are now is very very important and
[32:42] guide us Lord and keep us forgive our
[32:44] sins
[32:45] you said you sent your word and healed
[32:47] us so remember all the sick ones among
[32:49] us sometimes and just touch these
[32:51] wounded remember sister Rebeka their
[32:53] Lord having a lot of problems touch her
[32:55] and all of the others that are sick lord
[32:57] have you where our hearts and desires
[33:01] there's one thing that we could Lord
[33:03] live before you as you desire for us to
[33:06] be got us now as we read your word you
[33:09] come and speak to our hearts in Jesus
[33:11] name I mean if you'd like turning these
[33:13] scriptures turn to Hebrews 11 and then
[33:18] we'll go to Romans 8 he roos 11 and
[33:23] Romans 8 they try to continue our
[33:26] thought on the adoption and also
[33:29] remember those things okay
[33:31] Hebrews 11 now I want you to think all
[33:37] of these in Hebrews 11
[33:41] they're basically now you can
[33:45] interrelate the life story verses of
[33:48] Hebrews 11 to come down to fear talking
[33:53] about us but the basics of Hebrews 11 up
[33:57] until you get to the lies - its reverses
[33:59] is actually to Israel all right now I
[34:03] want that in your mind because when we
[34:06] say it later on I don't want you to
[34:07] flinch or what women see it ends up by
[34:13] saying they went out
[34:14] us cannot be made perfect
[34:18] well now even if you had Jacob even if
[34:22] you had you know Israel even if you had
[34:26] just Joseph even she had one or two it
[34:30] would still have the same meaning right
[34:33] that they're waiting on us okay now what
[34:38] is our thought that we've we've having
[34:40] we're talking about adoption but what
[34:42] not looking back
[34:45] not looking forward but looking where
[34:49] we're at right now because to me that's
[34:52] the only thing important is what's
[34:54] happening now I was listening to her
[34:57] reading yesterday or day before wonder
[34:59] and brother branham it it shocked me
[35:01] what he said he said the sign of the end
[35:05] was the material building the building
[35:11] have you ever seen a time when they're
[35:14] building like they are now I mean these
[35:16] homes coming up there's there's just
[35:18] condominiums there's everything coming
[35:20] building is running just right down the
[35:22] road
[35:24] he said that was big one of the signs
[35:26] would be building and going on cuz you
[35:31] know the what is it and is it anyhow it
[35:35] says crash you'll prosper and things
[35:38] like that you know we'll be in this day
[35:41] you know and all of those things but
[35:43] just remember that okay so think about
[35:45] it now don't get lost in well now that's
[35:49] the bright no that's not the bride
[35:51] totally here so let's pick up what we're
[35:53] talking about on verse 33 and read down
[35:59] through this to pick up 11 to 40 okay
[36:04] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[36:06] wrought righteousness obtained promises
[36:08] stopped the mouths of lions quenched the
[36:11] violence of fire escaped the edge of the
[36:13] sword cut the sword out of weakness were
[36:18] made strong waxed violet in fight turned
[36:23] to flight the armies of the aliens women
[36:26] received their dead raised
[36:27] is to laugh again and others were
[36:29] tortured and accepted the and others
[36:33] were tortured and exit not accepting
[36:36] deliverance that they might obtain a
[36:39] better resurrection and others had trial
[36:42] of cruel mockings and scourgings yeh
[36:45] moreover of bonds and imprisonment they
[36:48] were stoned they were sawn asunder
[36:50] they were tempted they were slain with
[36:52] the sword they wandered about in
[36:55] sheepskins see that can come right down
[36:57] to where we're living right about us you
[37:00] can and goatskins being destitute
[37:01] afflicted tormented of whom the world
[37:04] was not worthy they wandered in the
[37:06] desert and the mountains and the dens in
[37:08] the caves of the earth these are all
[37:10] having obtained listen and these all
[37:14] having obtained a good report through
[37:17] faith received not the promise all right
[37:24] now they didn't get to promise what God
[37:26] having provided some better thing for us
[37:29] that they without us should not be made
[37:33] perfect all right that means complete
[37:37] that doesn't mean you were going to
[37:38] raise them up and preach to them in
[37:40] things it means to come to full points
[37:44] or what you're aiming at all right now
[37:46] let's go to Roman's eight twenty-two and
[37:49] twenty-three where we know that the
[37:54] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[37:55] in pain together until now and not only
[37:59] they but ourselves also which have the
[38:01] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[38:04] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[38:06] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[38:09] of our body you may be seated the Lord
[38:12] at his blessing to the reading of the
[38:15] word as I said what's been our point not
[38:17] to look back that's great that's faith
[38:22] builder right because you can see this
[38:24] did happen it took place but not to look
[38:27] back to that because that will not
[38:30] change you that is already past it's
[38:34] done it won't change you all right now
[38:38] the future is out beyond so if your
[38:41] thinking of the future being beyond how
[38:44] can anything beyond where we are now
[38:46] change us were rad so let's get to right
[38:49] here let's get right where we're living
[38:52] and just think about it as I said about
[38:55] that listening and thinking of a reading
[38:57] there and the Prophet said you know all
[38:59] of this building that was going on it's
[39:01] a sign of the end well
[39:04] alright all this be able to going on the
[39:07] side of the end that was his point that
[39:10] he was making and showing what we could
[39:13] look at we can look around us and see
[39:17] the things happening in the world today
[39:19] and realize the end of all things that's
[39:21] come upon man alright and in doing that
[39:25] then we can say our time is at hand when
[39:28] you see Jerusalem compassed about all
[39:30] right like I'm saying the other day you
[39:31] know there for a little while they kind
[39:33] of pull back away from them not all the
[39:35] countries in time with a pull back away
[39:37] just a little bit back a few years ago
[39:39] but what do they do it now slowly
[39:41] gradually putting our troops right back
[39:45] into harm's way
[39:47] you know and see it's compassionate
[39:51] about on all sides all right now see
[39:54] then that means this is the day because
[39:58] that'll that's our thought that's what
[39:59] we're talking about now the Prophet said
[40:02] and it will read it in a minute when is
[40:04] the time or today that was to be like it
[40:07] is today of the manifestation of the
[40:09] sons and daughters of God all right what
[40:12] is manifestation well we think it as
[40:16] being great signs and wonders okay
[40:19] that's part of it we think it's the dead
[40:21] raised the sick healed and the thing and
[40:23] we and that's part of it but our problem
[40:26] there is we say I just don't see that
[40:28] going on no more
[40:29] oh we saw it in the Prophet but we don't
[40:33] see it now well wake up look around the
[40:36] world I can stand here and preach about
[40:38] the denominations and show you they're
[40:41] having a great revival in a lot of
[40:43] respects right look like more than us
[40:49] but that's not what it is what is
[40:52] manifestation is to make known
[40:57] well see that's to me is all that I've
[41:02] ever thought about on making known as
[41:04] one thing if you make God known he'll
[41:08] make you know if you just make him known
[41:12] if you go out and talk about him and
[41:15] testify and do the different things like
[41:18] that and I'll he'll come behind that and
[41:20] heal the sick and cast out devils and do
[41:23] all kind of work why because you've
[41:25] brought him on the scene by your
[41:27] testimony about him are you're making
[41:31] known of him all right
[41:33] no see then we firmly believe that God
[41:36] sent us a prophet and he brought us the
[41:39] word we're not looking for another one
[41:41] to come we believe the word that we have
[41:43] and all but we believe that it has to be
[41:46] made known that's all that I'm trying my
[41:50] best to do is to peace to speak to you
[41:53] about what the Prophet brought to us and
[41:56] having to make you know doing with that
[41:59] being something that is being made known
[42:02] not future and not past I'll keep saying
[42:06] that over and over because that's where
[42:08] I want your mind thinking I want your
[42:10] mind thinking of what's happening this
[42:12] day because it was a time came to our
[42:16] that Jesus when he stepped over he said
[42:17] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[42:22] no all right out of 6,000 year or save
[42:26] for thousands or some 5,000 years up to
[42:29] the iron he was making something
[42:33] personal that day this day can we make
[42:37] it personal if we don't see it as to
[42:42] where God is personal to each one of us
[42:44] then what kind of a God do we have what
[42:46] are we doing what what's the point
[42:49] thing and like I said now you remember
[42:54] this point you make him known brother
[42:56] branham made God known and then what'd
[42:59] he say he said now if I've preached the
[43:01] word let him come well you know he never
[43:07] failed to come
[43:08] why because he's made he'd known even
[43:12] though the Prophet would say he'd say
[43:13] starting now I don't know whether he'll
[43:15] come or not
[43:16] right well because he's God he can make
[43:20] up his own mind what he wants to do or
[43:22] not do they said how nobody said we'll
[43:25] believe it well you know what he never
[43:26] failed he came on the scene and and
[43:30] brought the word through the Prophet all
[43:32] right now if that's the point then if
[43:35] it's a manifestation of the sons of God
[43:41] that the whole world is waiting on then
[43:45] it was not just and I don't mean
[43:47] derogatory I've been playing will you
[43:49] always have been that it's not to say
[43:52] that it's just waiting on the prophet to
[43:55] come he's part of it I think God there
[44:00] wouldn't be anything else there wouldn't
[44:03] be any manifested sons and daughters of
[44:05] God if the Prophet had not have brought
[44:07] the word how much more honor could a
[44:09] give to that and see that that means I'm
[44:12] not tearing it down I'm putting him up
[44:14] he's the one all right but to us to just
[44:19] sit down and wait I don't agree
[44:23] even though you might know exactly what
[44:25] you're doing
[44:26] I mean to me I'm like this if I knew
[44:30] three days from now God was gonna come
[44:33] at a certain time of the day what would
[44:35] I be doing I'm supposed to be planting
[44:40] potatoes ahead right is that his way of
[44:43] making it natural I'm supposed to be
[44:46] busy about wouldn't you want to be busy
[44:50] wouldn't you want to tell everybody
[44:52] wouldn't you want to call everybody and
[44:54] say the Lord's coming in three days yeah
[44:58] because I mean why would we like run
[45:03] around I remember your saying one time
[45:04] he was talking about you know you say
[45:06] something about God being this out of
[45:08] the other and it scares people and he
[45:10] said why would you be scared Wow why
[45:15] would you be scared why would you you
[45:17] think that brother Dale you shouldn't
[45:19] preach so hard you scare my children
[45:22] you know about the day that we're living
[45:24] I think it's time to defer them to get
[45:28] scared you know I think it's time for
[45:31] them to understand what's taking place
[45:33] right now I think that's what we've been
[45:36] missing and that's my whole point now so
[45:39] we we start from that to do all right
[45:41] now then as I said about Romans we take
[45:47] Romans to come up with the point of
[45:49] looking at there is to be manifested
[45:53] sons and daughters of God and the world
[45:56] everything is groaning waiting upon the
[46:02] sons and daughters of God to come on the
[46:03] scene to make him known right see if we
[46:10] think as I said I'll repeat it again
[46:12] where we understand we think that it
[46:14] signs and wonders well don't worry about
[46:17] knowing that's going to be signs and
[46:19] wonders that's my old point that's why
[46:21] I'm trying to get us looking something
[46:22] right now
[46:23] I turned the denominational world and
[46:25] their signs and wonders taking place
[46:28] there's healing tzer's delivered since
[46:30] there's all kind of things yeah until I
[46:35] say it and without words no backing up
[46:37] that sometimes look like they're doing
[46:39] better than we are
[46:41] listen it can't be based on that but
[46:47] it's got to be based upon what the
[46:49] revealing of God's Word because there is
[46:54] the making known it's not your standing
[46:59] up now I want to introduce God to you
[47:01] everybody here you do see me standing
[47:04] right here you know no but it's not
[47:07] signs and wonders and things like that
[47:08] either all that's well and good but it's
[47:11] when you preach the gospel because the
[47:15] gospel is the power of God unto
[47:17] salvation
[47:20] you say well I'm a woman I don't have to
[47:23] preach we preach to your kids all right
[47:26] but now follow that thought now as we go
[47:29] through because looking then taking that
[47:33] the whole world
[47:36] is waiting on you and I that's my
[47:41] thought for the point waiting on you and
[47:43] I all right now so if we're if the
[47:49] world's waiting on you and I we ought to
[47:51] be started trying to get on the line to
[47:53] what to find out what do you know we're
[47:56] we're living in what we're taking place
[47:57] on it see
[47:59] and then what was our last thought now
[48:02] our last thought was dealing with the
[48:07] dispensation of adoption the time of
[48:13] adoption all right now there was
[48:16] something now I'll click there so wait
[48:18] you you preaching Wednesday okay you
[48:21] ain't gonna believe in going on away you
[48:23] are for winners okay okay huh you're
[48:26] leaving Wednesday okay how do you get
[48:28] through preaching Iran are you gonna be
[48:34] here with him see he's in the moving
[48:36] process so Aaron I'll be ministering
[48:38] Wednesday okay now get that strap oh we
[48:41] go but all right waiting on you and I
[48:47] now if you're waiting on something it
[48:52] doesn't mean that it's already priced a
[48:57] little no Piper you know here if you're
[49:03] waiting on something it can't be what
[49:05] was you know heist that's done right yes
[49:10] that's plain sensible right they don't
[49:13] need a revelation it's finished you're
[49:16] not waiting on them to have a or go to
[49:19] the moon no they've been to the moon so
[49:23] all that's done so it's not waiting on
[49:26] it like that
[49:27] alright but it's neither is it to say
[49:30] I'm waiting on the future because a lot
[49:37] of things can happen alright and it will
[49:41] take place that what the world waiting
[49:43] on will take place but it's not waiting
[49:47] on a time or
[49:48] date or it's waiting on a group of
[49:51] people that's that's the thing that I've
[49:53] always tried to get you to see it's
[49:55] waiting on you with what part of God
[49:58] that you have we've all got to have a
[50:01] personal relationship with Jesus Christ
[50:05] all right now the Prophet said it I
[50:07] didn't he said that God is not complete
[50:11] without you
[50:14] well I this it was waiting there's there
[50:17] can't be as we're gonna read it in a
[50:19] minute where he says waiting on the
[50:20] manifest is right right here now it's
[50:25] not out there in the future all right
[50:28] let's see get the point of Hebrews the
[50:32] Hebrews 11 is talking basically of the
[50:37] Old Testament people now I know what
[50:42] goes with this line god I know the story
[50:45] but listen to what I'm talking about
[50:50] the Old Testament people are waiting on
[50:53] you and I no no no that was waiting on
[50:56] Jesus go well alright Hebrews 13:8
[51:01] doesn't mean anything in bringing Saint
[51:04] personal to you yeah but Jesus ray see
[51:09] I'm sory gonna say I know that people
[51:11] say well the Old Testament Saints was
[51:14] waiting on Jesus
[51:16] now in the New Testament we're waiting
[51:20] on somebody else yeah they try to make
[51:23] that part of the story but one night the
[51:25] story like that well not make it like it
[51:28] is you realize those Old Testament
[51:31] Saints are not in the seventh dimension
[51:39] they're not in the presence of God now
[51:43] if it is the Bible's wrong cause it said
[51:45] that he's the only one that's reached
[51:47] the immortality all right no all right
[51:51] they were waiting on him to raise yes
[51:54] they were waiting on him to come yes but
[51:57] that part never done anything for them
[52:02] right because they didn't accept it all
[52:05] right we're here in the end to her that
[52:07] they're waiting on you and I now we're
[52:09] gonna read what brother Branham says so
[52:11] you can you can argue the point was with
[52:13] him
[52:14] he says the Old Testament people waiting
[52:17] on you and me well I went way back under
[52:21] yeah they're not in there want to be
[52:25] right state all right then when it says
[52:29] how long how long they're longing to be
[52:32] changed and brought to a different
[52:33] position so they're waiting on something
[52:36] to take place if you understand what I'm
[52:39] getting at we'll catch it when we get
[52:41] back on another message or to see here
[52:44] is the day that God sent His Word right
[52:49] the Prophet came in this day to bring
[52:53] the word all right he had a lot to do in
[52:56] what he was doing okay and it's
[53:00] identically laying out to the same order
[53:03] as to the Lord Jesus and and what he
[53:05] done the Lord Jesus had a River Jordan
[53:10] right then he had a time through there
[53:15] of manifesting God then he had a time he
[53:18] had to go to mount Transfiguration okay
[53:22] that's no problem brother Branham had
[53:23] her Ohio River and then he had a time
[53:28] down through there trying to teach us
[53:29] the word all right
[53:30] and then he went to Aaron you know after
[53:33] Arizona met with the angels of God come
[53:36] back and preach the seven sails I saw
[53:39] well and good but you know what brother
[53:41] Branham said about it you've got to have
[53:46] your own Mount Carmel experience you
[53:51] heard him say that you've got to have
[53:54] your Mount Carmel I've told you about it
[53:57] when I was there in Israel you know and
[53:59] when we got to Mount Carmel well I
[54:02] learned is a great big image up here
[54:03] like you know Elijah with his foot down
[54:07] on the heads of the prophets Bale you
[54:09] know a veil and a big old knife and all
[54:11] like that well that was what everybody's
[54:13] going to look at this
[54:14] our lives are doing it well I enjoyed
[54:16] that but I just walking around and you
[54:19] know not going around looking and Peggy
[54:21] was following me and always walking
[54:23] along and while I said dirty wish I was
[54:28] looking for Sun you know what I was
[54:31] looking for they were how you pronounce
[54:35] that the Madonna though the Virgin Mary
[54:39] I knew there had to be somewhere because
[54:42] Mount Carmel was Catholic so I was
[54:47] looking for the shrine to her more than
[54:50] I was to a logical I knew what Elijah
[54:52] done but I knew also that would be there
[54:56] so I had to search and in there it says
[54:58] you know and I thought how many people's
[55:02] looking at this thing and some of them
[55:05] can even see Elijah but not seeing who's
[55:09] really in charge because Mount Carmel
[55:11] was Catholic Reverend said all of
[55:13] Christians have a Mount Carmel
[55:16] experience you're born to get experience
[55:22] and they were coming out of
[55:23] denominationalism the Mount Carmel
[55:25] experience see then that all ties
[55:29] together that's what I'm trying to get
[55:31] you to think about see those Old
[55:35] Testament Saints then they are waiting
[55:39] on you and I because the only one that
[55:44] has reached their mortality is the Lord
[55:46] Jesus Christ brother Branham when he
[55:49] went beyond the curtain of time he could
[55:51] not see the Lord Jesus he said he's
[55:55] above he's in another dimension now he
[55:58] couldn't do it we think we can do it no
[56:02] he couldn't do it he knew then he had to
[56:06] come back and bring the message to try
[56:10] to draw it dark he could see people dark
[56:13] but the people that I was depending upon
[56:15] him right that's a wonderful experience
[56:20] we're not two and brother round them up
[56:22] to a great big thing or not belittle
[56:24] laymen are doing we're trying to put him
[56:26] in the right place the world
[56:27] means a lot but yet to be there
[56:29] ourselves see they're waiting on you and
[56:35] I did a lot of people don't believe I
[56:39] was trying to get that point to you
[56:40] about dispensations I know the quote
[56:44] from brother Branham he will say one
[56:45] time I believe in dispensations you say
[56:47] the next time I don't believe in
[56:49] dispensation no he says both ways I've
[56:54] seen I don't want you to get lost and
[56:56] and we talked about dispensation and
[56:58] then you come up with a quote we look at
[56:59] this quote well see I'm already telling
[57:01] you the quote I've already studied the
[57:03] story
[57:04] alright see then that dispensation means
[57:09] a time a place position or whatever it
[57:15] can mean or Authority it can mean a
[57:17] person you know to deal with words
[57:19] dispensation honor but what would be our
[57:22] dispensation
[57:23] it's the dispensation were that we come
[57:27] to the position to realize who we are
[57:30] and what we're doing here why are we
[57:33] here I'll even drop in a little bit to
[57:38] you we're going to think about later the
[57:43] Lord Jesus wouldn't adopt it on the
[57:45] River Jordan it was adopted on the Mount
[57:50] of Transfiguration drop a little
[57:54] thoughts to you what do you think about
[57:57] that so what are they saying that all
[57:59] right then when I make the point see
[58:01] then you if you're listening you'll
[58:04] catch it all right listen
[58:07] but he said dispensations one time he'll
[58:13] say I don't believe in it negative time
[58:15] he'll say he believes in it but I tried
[58:18] to express that with allies point there
[58:20] last week of what of thinking about why
[58:25] would he make those statements that away
[58:27] and to realize then what he's saying is
[58:32] you can't change if you change you got
[58:39] the wrong dispensation
[58:41] you don't try to change it you leave it
[58:44] like it is and words that in Hebrews
[58:46] 13:8 of either the right point all right
[58:49] so brother Branham wasn't looking for a
[58:51] time to come that would change things
[58:56] what was he looking at what was
[58:59] happening was wonderful and all of those
[59:03] years it had been the message he was
[59:05] bringing and that was the dispensation
[59:09] comes to me the dispensation of adoption
[59:11] when we read here and the Prophet said
[59:13] that it was waiting on you and me to me
[59:16] that dispensation started back in the
[59:20] days of the early ministry of the
[59:22] Prophet and that's what he's here for to
[59:28] bring us to a time a dispensation a
[59:31] positional point in word that we can
[59:34] believe what we're doing here and think
[59:39] about why we here and think about why
[59:41] has it been 50 years just the going of
[59:47] the Prophet because we've been in a
[59:49] dispensation a dispensation that he
[59:54] started preaching in the 30s it wasn't
[1:00:02] meaning that it wasn't here before
[1:00:03] that's what's the work on how to get to
[1:00:05] and we'll get the message part of it
[1:00:07] those disciples listen we're in the
[1:00:11] dispensation of adoption of their day
[1:00:14] but that adoption part of their day was
[1:00:18] not the headstone coming it was not what
[1:00:28] we've looked for well yet they were not
[1:00:31] fully manifested adopted sons and
[1:00:34] daughters of God into bringing forth the
[1:00:37] word to change the bodies what the
[1:00:43] prophet picks that up cuz you picked
[1:00:44] that point up as we go along they watch
[1:00:46] them this is the time all right go ahead
[1:00:49] let's read number number three brothers
[1:00:56] well back up to number one let's get it
[1:00:58] if I this have to do with its read and
[1:01:01] we'll we'll get it eventually you know
[1:01:04] we'll get changed we've on the other
[1:01:05] side and we sat down talked about okay
[1:01:08] listen what's everything waiting on
[1:01:12] what's the whole creation waiting for
[1:01:17] the manifestations of the sons of God
[1:01:22] the making known of the sons and
[1:01:27] daughters of God if you don't see your
[1:01:29] day in this hour how can you be in the
[1:01:32] manifestation okay it's waiting for the
[1:01:39] church to become in to its position who
[1:01:45] was the sons of God when Adam where was
[1:01:49] his domain the earth he had dominion on
[1:01:52] the earth is that right he wasn't LOL
[1:01:54] l a-- him then he was jehovah and that
[1:01:58] is i am god and I've made some lesser
[1:02:02] ones under me who's that that's been
[1:02:07] kind right and I give them a Dominion
[1:02:11] and their Dominion the meant Dominion
[1:02:14] under them is the earth what was Adams
[1:02:17] domain the earth he had full control of
[1:02:20] the earth right that was set for him all
[1:02:26] the whole creation is waiting for the
[1:02:28] sons of God to be manifested another was
[1:02:30] wrought their way they're waiting on
[1:02:33] somebody to stand forth and say this is
[1:02:39] it right so what did the Prophet come
[1:02:45] forth he come forth back there in the
[1:02:47] 30s started preaching the great
[1:02:50] teachings of a lot of things he hits we
[1:02:52] don't go but 247 but then you jump up to
[1:02:55] about 1950 and he preaches the message
[1:02:58] of of the inner veil they've changed the
[1:03:01] title to another title later but go read
[1:03:04] that message and look at
[1:03:06] I'm talking about a living moving
[1:03:09] instrumentality walking on two feet of a
[1:03:12] people of God he was already preaching
[1:03:15] those things the denominations couldn't
[1:03:17] follow him because they knew nothing of
[1:03:19] adoption and I told you we taught
[1:03:22] adoption but we taught it as just a
[1:03:25] basis of an adoption that didn't relate
[1:03:29] to us having anything and surely we
[1:03:36] couldn't go on to the adoption of the
[1:03:38] change of the body call we all had to
[1:03:39] get us a new one cause we're smoking
[1:03:41] winter we couldn't do those things we'd
[1:03:43] waiting on another body well I showed we
[1:03:47] didn't understand what the Prophet when
[1:03:50] he did he didn't beat the pentecostal he
[1:03:52] tried to correct the pentacle he said
[1:03:54] that's where you've made your mistake
[1:03:56] thinking you've got everything to start
[1:03:59] with and he said you just got to the
[1:04:01] beginning no wonder he wasn't understood
[1:04:07] then surely as he goes along in the
[1:04:09] message and progresses progresses more
[1:04:12] and more they got less and less to be
[1:04:14] able to understand him but listen and
[1:04:17] all the whole creation is waiting for
[1:04:22] the sons of God to be manifested do you
[1:04:26] believe that well I see that brother
[1:04:30] Branham back yonder
[1:04:31] I've seen him back in all right now what
[1:04:35] you gonna do come on if it's back there
[1:04:40] I remember the story if it's back there
[1:04:43] you can't depend on that part well of
[1:04:46] course it's already finished
[1:04:50] and see it was it was not to be just the
[1:04:56] Prophet he was to come to make manifest
[1:04:59] make known God but where did he make God
[1:05:04] known
[1:05:11] or deported brother on him like God
[1:05:13] don't in a bride right it's that problem
[1:05:20] is that any trouble he made known abroad
[1:05:25] he was part of that bride didn't you
[1:05:31] know what he was waiting to Sam all
[1:05:33] right he's in the grave now weightings
[1:05:35] not that's just too much now you're
[1:05:37] doing away with ain't doing away with
[1:05:38] nothing I'm telling you the truth
[1:05:40] you're the one that's got it all built
[1:05:43] up doing away with something ain't doing
[1:05:44] away with nothing yeah I'm still
[1:05:49] standing exactly where I was nineteen
[1:05:53] what 58 60 excuse me I believe you damn
[1:06:02] I believe it now what there's no way in
[1:06:07] the world you and I could ever come to a
[1:06:09] change of the body outside of this
[1:06:11] prophet come on
[1:06:17] roll it on up a little to the next one
[1:06:20] is that right waiting God trying to
[1:06:24] place his church in position to manifest
[1:06:28] himself getting one that he can work
[1:06:31] through like this is ours there's my
[1:06:33] spirit flowing free nobody's exampling
[1:06:35] what's taking place you know there he is
[1:06:37] that I can work here get him another one
[1:06:40] over here and place him I can place them
[1:06:43] adoption placing manifesting taking him
[1:06:48] out and put a put a saw ceremony on it
[1:06:53] visit him with an angel tell him
[1:06:56] something well didn't brother branham
[1:07:00] come and make god no and then God took
[1:07:03] the prophet to the backside of the
[1:07:04] desert not in Arizona and made itself
[1:07:07] known to it he give him something he
[1:07:09] told him to come back to Jeffersonville
[1:07:11] it would mean the seal food we may know
[1:07:14] what if I always tried to teach to you
[1:07:16] what is the headstone the seal because
[1:07:21] that's part of the word and the
[1:07:23] cornerstone was the work
[1:07:24] so what about it and if he's told the
[1:07:27] truth now if he's just making up
[1:07:29] something like we were talking there
[1:07:31] kind of yesterday this this man in a
[1:07:34] certain place years ago he got up you
[1:07:37] know he's young and Overlord is a
[1:07:38] minister he got up and he said I take
[1:07:41] every spirit in this building under my
[1:07:43] control and I'm not making fun of it
[1:07:47] making no light I'm just telling what I
[1:07:48] thought okay I thought God don't let no
[1:07:51] demon in this building because he ain't
[1:07:56] got no authority over it and I ain't
[1:07:58] either so I know what's gonna happen the
[1:08:04] door is going to open he's gonna leave
[1:08:05] and I'm gonna be left so I said Lord
[1:08:08] don't let nothing come here
[1:08:09] he ain't got what he's trying to say
[1:08:11] he's got those he left town orden what's
[1:08:15] the money okay all right listen now if
[1:08:21] he's told the truth if he's just making
[1:08:22] up something won't work we've seen that
[1:08:25] it don't work we've had a lot of that
[1:08:27] but I mean but I mean manifestation of
[1:08:30] the sons of God when God manifests
[1:08:33] himself and he sends him out now how
[1:08:36] does a child of God go how did God send
[1:08:40] his son he came down and went in him
[1:08:43] right
[1:08:45] is that true now he came down and when
[1:08:47] he how did he send astir he came down
[1:08:49] and went in his church so it's him in
[1:08:52] the adoption not me and you this is not
[1:08:55] now I'm gonna say this it's gonna sound
[1:08:57] contrary to what that the point I'm
[1:08:59] trying to make but it's not he's not
[1:09:01] coming to make you and me me and you
[1:09:03] manifest God's coming to make yourself
[1:09:06] manifest the words God he's in me and
[1:09:10] you so automatically it's gonna make us
[1:09:12] manifest that's pointed out trying to
[1:09:16] get want to go we make him know he'll
[1:09:18] make us known right all right
[1:09:26] then he goes forth and what he says is
[1:09:28] true what he does is the truth what he
[1:09:30] does he manifest Christ how do you judge
[1:09:32] him by the way he stays with the word
[1:09:36] now how do you judge a son or daughter
[1:09:38] of God how they stay with the word all
[1:09:40] right jump on over to number two which
[1:09:48] is questions and answers on Hebrews
[1:09:52] until the Gentile dispensation now you
[1:09:54] people that don't believe in
[1:09:55] dispensation what about that that's what
[1:10:02] I don't understand it comes over here he
[1:10:04] says he believes in this Messiah over
[1:10:06] here he says he don't believe in this
[1:10:07] one so you get what he's talking about
[1:10:10] he don't believe in changes there's been
[1:10:13] no change
[1:10:14] listen Luther brought justification
[1:10:18] Wesley brought sanctification the
[1:10:21] Pentecost were brought to baptism when
[1:10:23] the Holy Ghost the Prophet stepped out
[1:10:25] on that right and he believed what they
[1:10:29] believed and stepped out with them
[1:10:31] because they were teaching the baptism
[1:10:33] of the holy ghost or it hasn't changed
[1:10:39] there's not a dispensation of let's say
[1:10:42] already than anyone said there's a
[1:10:44] dispensation of the Holy Ghost he says
[1:10:47] these discipline stations of John the
[1:10:48] Baptist
[1:10:49] but now put it all together and all that
[1:10:52] you've got what have you got you got
[1:10:54] Christ made manifest
[1:10:55] this is making known our Father it's not
[1:11:00] the son being known that's where we're
[1:11:03] going wrong in our thoughts listening to
[1:11:05] the point trying to make a son now it's
[1:11:07] us making our father don't see that we
[1:11:11] make him known he'll make us know right
[1:11:17] come on kids you you go to school and
[1:11:20] everything any and you ashamed of your
[1:11:22] mom and daddy and you walk around you
[1:11:23] know and you ashamed of them or you know
[1:11:28] what if I do if I seen one of my kids
[1:11:29] doing that when he come around for the
[1:11:33] paying ticket he'd be the problem when
[1:11:37] he come around to say daddy I need some
[1:11:38] money on sight I've not see daddy you
[1:11:41] want to go you had a daddy some
[1:11:43] whorehouse cuz and I'm on that you know
[1:11:45] you're crazy
[1:11:47] I agree we
[1:11:49] but it works alright so if you don't
[1:11:54] believe in dispensations you're out but
[1:11:56] don't believe in a changing dispensation
[1:11:59] that to me is what the prophets doing
[1:12:01] don't believe in things changing to
[1:12:03] another thing it's not it's the same
[1:12:07] Holy Ghost can I quote the Prophet the
[1:12:11] same Holy Ghost that justify the
[1:12:12] Lutheran sanctified the Methodist is now
[1:12:15] setting in order to coming of the Lord
[1:12:16] that God can pour into us his fullness
[1:12:19] and the Baptism and take us in the
[1:12:21] rapture they changed this is the same
[1:12:25] Holy Ghost that come on the dev's of
[1:12:27] Pentecost see and come right on down
[1:12:32] into the day of reducer Street Pentecost
[1:12:34] it's the same Holy Ghost it's not
[1:12:38] something different it's not a different
[1:12:40] dispensation it's all in the same
[1:12:43] dispensation this is the dispensation of
[1:12:46] making him know when that prophet
[1:12:48] stepped out there that's what God was
[1:12:49] waiting on right he was waiting on one
[1:12:51] band that could believe his word and he
[1:12:56] was pleased to dwell anyway now that's
[1:12:59] all I've ever asked to be in you and all
[1:13:01] of us is God pleased to dwell in minyan
[1:13:05] if we have the new birth he is if we
[1:13:10] have the new birth he's pleased to dwell
[1:13:12] in it oh you make it live it no I don't
[1:13:15] make it strong enough listen let's go
[1:13:19] ahead then I'm trying to find out one
[1:13:23] yeah this is one won't go ahead and
[1:13:26] number number three blowing up number
[1:13:30] three under the adoption the mystery how
[1:13:35] much serious this is where we ended up
[1:13:37] the other day
[1:13:38] and the scripture packed me back into
[1:13:40] the Old Testament then over into the New
[1:13:42] Testament I'd sewn together here well
[1:13:44] mr. Eve is coming mr. of his will
[1:13:48] mr. Evans setting of setting together
[1:13:51] remember it cannot be taught in a
[1:13:55] seminary it's a mystery
[1:13:57] you cannot know it by education by
[1:14:00] theology it's a mystery that's been
[1:14:02] hidden
[1:14:03] since the foundation of the world
[1:14:04] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:14:07] sons of God now read that with common
[1:14:11] sense what has been waiting for the
[1:14:13] foundation of the world
[1:14:16] do you read correctly I thought we're
[1:14:19] supposed to read all of us the same way
[1:14:21] and come out to the same point so listen
[1:14:23] what he said
[1:14:23] it's a mystery that's been hidden since
[1:14:25] the foundation in the world now there's
[1:14:29] a minister's been hidden with the
[1:14:30] Foundation's work I'm gonna read what he
[1:14:32] said on that in a minute so come on
[1:14:34] listen waiting for the manifestation of
[1:14:36] Sunday well what's been the mystery that
[1:14:38] that the whole world has been waiting on
[1:14:40] what's the mystery the manifestation of
[1:14:44] the sons and daughters of the Living God
[1:14:47] God living in his people doing and
[1:14:51] declaring these things the adoption of
[1:14:56] his children that's the mystery come on
[1:15:04] [Music]
[1:15:06] you are you listening to what I said
[1:15:08] well ago but a run said to God he is not
[1:15:11] complete without you you realize then
[1:15:17] according to Christ the mystery
[1:15:22] according to Christ the mystery the
[1:15:25] bride is part of the mystery and is to
[1:15:29] be revealed that's what your prophet
[1:15:32] said recross the mystery go back to it
[1:15:34] and listen to it the mystery is the
[1:15:39] brightest part of the mystery what I
[1:15:44] said you make him known
[1:15:47] he will then make you known and he'll
[1:15:53] say this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:15:55] pleased to dwell I'm pleased to take
[1:16:02] what he says I'm pleased to do what he's
[1:16:05] calling for but if you can't see it in
[1:16:11] the bride now listen if you can't see it
[1:16:15] in the bride it
[1:16:16] you need to look back and see it in the
[1:16:19] profit all right if it was in the profit
[1:16:21] that means they've got to be somewhere
[1:16:25] somebody to finish this that's no
[1:16:29] problem
[1:16:30] Twyla no problem looking back or
[1:16:33] whatever I have no problem with all of
[1:16:35] these returns and administrators that I
[1:16:38] believe in it I just believed a little
[1:16:43] bit different from what a lot of people
[1:16:44] thinks about it but I believe it but see
[1:16:49] that profit came to preach the message
[1:16:53] and you know what you and I are the
[1:16:55] message that he come to preach that were
[1:17:01] the bride across where God made manifest
[1:17:08] that's what he says now look waiting for
[1:17:14] the manifestations of sons of God now
[1:17:16] watch what he said tell me my brother
[1:17:17] tell me my sister when was the time that
[1:17:20] the sons of God was ever to be
[1:17:22] manifested outside of this time now when
[1:17:33] you come in through and got into
[1:17:36] Lutheran Westland him it had fallen away
[1:17:38] so far until you didn't have the faith
[1:17:42] of the father's being dealt with right
[1:17:45] and you couldn't call that adoption town
[1:17:48] yet they were children we'll get to that
[1:17:52] as we go along if you'll listen you'll
[1:17:54] understand Luther name had the baptism
[1:17:58] when the Holy Ghost but they were
[1:18:00] children that were born into the family
[1:18:01] but they had no tutor they had no point
[1:18:04] it didn't he didn't send that because
[1:18:07] that's not the time of it because
[1:18:08] there's a long gap now I'm saying some
[1:18:13] things that eventually when I say it
[1:18:14] you'll in order click the Lord Jesus
[1:18:17] Christ stood on the River Jordan and
[1:18:20] brought his message three years he
[1:18:27] walked in that message
[1:18:31] right telling all the things showing all
[1:18:34] of the thought Yeti wasn't adopted to
[1:18:37] the Mount of Transfiguration because the
[1:18:41] hearing him never come on the River
[1:18:44] Jordan it came about a transfer garage
[1:18:49] right and you know he didn't have but a
[1:18:52] six months message come on you pick up
[1:18:59] right around his ministry in about sixty
[1:19:01] two spoken word to regional seed right
[1:19:03] in there or where he's talking about
[1:19:05] what is it uh is this the time search
[1:19:11] right in there 62 and you go through his
[1:19:15] ministry and you got three and a half
[1:19:16] years everything lays perfectly in top
[1:19:22] if you listen and think about it so
[1:19:27] brother branham didn't have a long
[1:19:28] ministry you have short ministry the
[1:19:32] Lord Jesus had a short ministry but we
[1:19:36] got so far away we've had fifty years
[1:19:39] that God is waiting on me and you 50
[1:19:46] years since they're going to the Prophet
[1:19:52] waiting on me and you well I didn't know
[1:19:57] what's waiting on me well who's it white
[1:19:59] now a bus okay outside of this time when
[1:20:10] were there ever a time in the history
[1:20:14] that manifests the time to deliver all
[1:20:18] nature now he's getting into adoption
[1:20:21] about total deliverance he's coming into
[1:20:23] the change of the body right so that's
[1:20:26] not coming till this in time the next
[1:20:28] were self groaning waiting for the time
[1:20:29] of the manifestation of wine before the
[1:20:31] atonement was made before the Holy Ghost
[1:20:34] would ever poured out before that all
[1:20:36] now that's Old Testament right and I'm
[1:20:38] down there there couldn't have been
[1:20:41] manifestation he it had to wait till
[1:20:45] this time I told you what I said while
[1:20:49] ago was you listening
[1:20:51] I believe this dispensation of adoption
[1:20:53] started with the prophets ministry back
[1:20:55] to her in like 33 or something when he
[1:20:57] began to bring forth that's just their
[1:21:00] personal opinion we'll see he had to go
[1:21:04] to Arizona and connect with the angels
[1:21:07] of the Lord before he could come back
[1:21:09] and tell you what the seals were right
[1:21:13] so he must have had his adoption
[1:21:15] he said well brother dad when do you
[1:21:17] think brother Branham was adopted I
[1:21:18] believe he's adopted dinner and it in
[1:21:22] Ohio River I don't you don't my Bible
[1:21:29] the church people don't have thinking
[1:21:31] about what the Bible means you take
[1:21:35] brother runs ministry and compare it
[1:21:36] exactly with the Lord Jesus it comes out
[1:21:39] right - exactly
[1:21:42] River Jordan Mount of Transfiguration
[1:21:46] Ohio River Tucson Arizona opening of the
[1:21:51] seals bringing forth of things the plan
[1:21:55] of redemption perfectly identically lays
[1:21:58] that away but now where's our part
[1:22:03] they've got to be a people to make the
[1:22:06] word manifest
[1:22:07] that's all I'm preaching there's got to
[1:22:10] be somebody to make manifest what the
[1:22:12] prophet talk I'm not trying to teach
[1:22:16] something else no I'm not trying to
[1:22:17] teach something else he didn't teach I'm
[1:22:18] trying to teach what he taught because
[1:22:22] only through that can it be broke all
[1:22:25] things is broke comes shaping up to a
[1:22:27] headstone to the manifestation of the
[1:22:29] sons of God coming back and the Spirit
[1:22:31] of God coming into these men right so
[1:22:35] perfectly until their ministry will be
[1:22:38] so close like Christ too little join him
[1:22:41] and his church together why can't we
[1:22:45] believe then the Prophet brought the
[1:22:48] message but there's a fivefold ministry
[1:22:49] to take it on right
[1:22:54] how are you gonna get it all right
[1:23:00] listen
[1:23:04] go ahead to number five what was the
[1:23:08] Holy Ghost given for but now when we
[1:23:13] need it the Spirit of God raises a
[1:23:16] standard now what is the standard is
[1:23:26] that what he's saying the Spirit of God
[1:23:29] raises up a standard what is it what's
[1:23:32] the standard now Azusa Street you know
[1:23:39] had it fine but the book of Acts is you
[1:23:42] standard right come on I go way back
[1:23:46] there that was the standard now watch
[1:23:48] what he's just saying though Spirit of
[1:23:51] God raises up a standard what is it he's
[1:23:53] pouring in his spirit and those who are
[1:24:00] resting out younger in the grave are
[1:24:03] under the altar of God as the scripture
[1:24:06] says are crying how long Lord how long
[1:24:09] how much longer God's waiting on me and
[1:24:13] you am I reading something strange
[1:24:20] the church is waiting on me and you
[1:24:23] adoption time when God can pour into his
[1:24:26] and to us his fullness his power his
[1:24:29] resurrection that when the church in
[1:24:32] Christ becomes so close together till
[1:24:34] Christ becomes visible among us and
[1:24:36] raises the dead and we go in the rapture
[1:24:39] that was after a while that just those
[1:24:43] who are he wanted to talk about it later
[1:24:45] filled with the Holy Ghost goes in that
[1:24:48] rapture for the rest that did live not
[1:24:50] for the space of a thousand years that's
[1:24:52] right
[1:24:53] just Holy Ghost filled people is what
[1:24:55] went in the rapture so we know what's
[1:24:59] going in the rapture all to go still
[1:25:00] people but the whole world is waiting on
[1:25:05] you and I
[1:25:09] you said well brother tail I want to
[1:25:12] find my place all right
[1:25:15] my place is in the word I know mine I'm
[1:25:19] a minister I know what I'm supposed to
[1:25:22] do that's supposed to preach the gospel
[1:25:23] I know that how that's to be what do you
[1:25:26] know yours it can be just a benchwarmer
[1:25:32] you remember the story that the lady
[1:25:35] that was cleaning the Pew in the church
[1:25:38] the seats and she was praying lord
[1:25:41] blessed this person here Lord blessed
[1:25:44] this person and just going down the line
[1:25:46] just cleaning the pews and spraying for
[1:25:49] the people that sit there you know what
[1:25:51] it started a revival it can work
[1:26:01] what about it authority go to the next
[1:26:09] one we pick up to hear him those that
[1:26:15] were at the end of something everybody
[1:26:17] knows that civilization can't stand any
[1:26:19] longer she's just weaving and shaking
[1:26:22] what's it waiting for it's way past view
[1:26:25] as it was in the days of Noah
[1:26:27] long-suffering it slapped over for the
[1:26:30] elects sake it's left over for the elect
[1:26:35] state way pious but God's waiting to get
[1:26:38] his church in order he's waiting on you
[1:26:41] and I may he grant the blessing now God
[1:26:44] now listen to the point where I'm trying
[1:26:46] to make we've read I know to God's
[1:26:51] waiting on you and I but we don't have
[1:26:59] nothing to do we just sit around waiting
[1:27:01] on the bus full of and God's waiting on
[1:27:06] you and I when he can pour in his
[1:27:09] fullness and the baptism and take us in
[1:27:13] the rapture you say well what's wrong
[1:27:16] why are we here fifty years and because
[1:27:20] we have
[1:27:21] I realize yet that he's waiting on us
[1:27:24] and what's it matter to me if it's fifty
[1:27:27] more I'm gonna be old but if he's
[1:27:30] ordained it to me I'll be right here
[1:27:33] right if he's ordained it to me I'll be
[1:27:37] right here
[1:27:38] what about you well I think don't know
[1:27:42] imma call it a fifty years a lot of
[1:27:44] times well you don't believe in God
[1:27:46] correctly then cuz why can't he bring us
[1:27:49] another hundred years what about God
[1:27:53] waiting on you and me I thought was
[1:27:58] waiting on him waiting on him to do what
[1:28:05] he wants us to call him on the same row
[1:28:12] try it sometime
[1:28:14] you know what it might work you know I
[1:28:20] don't mean that Crockett or making a
[1:28:22] joke I means the truth sometimes the
[1:28:26] reason we don't get what we ask well I
[1:28:28] mean what we're wanting is cause we
[1:28:30] don't ask for it I was just looking at
[1:28:34] one there's one right here somewhere
[1:28:36] close we're brother Branham it may be
[1:28:37] the next one where brother man's talking
[1:28:39] about it and he says not now you
[1:28:42] remember mark 11 not if he says if you
[1:28:48] say not if God says it if you say it and
[1:28:56] doubt nod your heart it take place well
[1:29:01] if it don't take place you know what I
[1:29:02] got enough sense know one thing boy
[1:29:05] ain't got writing my heart good he said
[1:29:09] it a lot let's quit blaming him and
[1:29:14] waiting on him and start moving out into
[1:29:16] the message 50 years it are the week we
[1:29:20] can move a little bit we order at least
[1:29:23] me to the basis that we're not
[1:29:24] flimflamming along in the message and
[1:29:26] don't know what this is
[1:29:27] what brother Sorrell said this is what
[1:29:29] brother listen said is that whenever we
[1:29:31] just don't know what to believe
[1:29:35] why did the Bible change did the
[1:29:41] prophets message know well I just don't
[1:29:47] I I just can't see nothing going on what
[1:29:51] does that mean it ain't going on at
[1:29:57] least you'll have enough sense to say
[1:29:58] that's what I think you know instead of
[1:30:02] trying to make it that it ain't working
[1:30:05] we have seen God move among us you're
[1:30:10] looking for great manifestations why not
[1:30:14] look at the simplicity and see that God
[1:30:18] has moved among yeah but he's that see
[1:30:20] there you got the whole time he's out
[1:30:22] there you know cuz he's poured out his
[1:30:25] spirit now if you're gonna holler he's
[1:30:28] out there I'll holler with you
[1:30:29] let's go out to our if you think God is
[1:30:35] more than he is here let's go there
[1:30:37] right oh you don't talk my language
[1:30:44] hungry way I talk different because I
[1:30:48] know what I'm talking about
[1:30:50] God is waiting on me and you he's done
[1:30:54] everything he could do he's give us the
[1:30:57] message he's give us tapes books etc
[1:31:00] until everything is our fingertips we
[1:31:04] just push a button we used to I have
[1:31:06] spent three months trying to find one
[1:31:08] quote to preached one sermon from back
[1:31:12] in the old days right now you just there
[1:31:19] it is and even if you do wind up with 50
[1:31:24] you can still sit down until you find it
[1:31:31] because you know it's one of the 50
[1:31:33] right and God's give us many shortcuts
[1:31:39] you know who I'm talking about
[1:31:40] we had to come through the dots to learn
[1:31:42] a lot of things but then you know that's
[1:31:44] all right I learned how to shortcut the
[1:31:47] message
[1:31:48] so I wanted to get what I wanted but
[1:31:52] when they come up with the winders that
[1:31:54] was exactly what I was doing I just did
[1:31:56] now the ability to shortcut it enough I
[1:31:58] could cut it from 50 quotes to 30 but
[1:32:03] when they come up with a Windows they
[1:32:04] can cut it from 50 to zero or one
[1:32:09] right he said what are you getting that
[1:32:11] I'm saying Church God has done
[1:32:13] everything he could do he has put
[1:32:16] everything at our fingertips put it to
[1:32:21] where we have it we can read it we can
[1:32:24] pull it up in an instant then what's he
[1:32:32] waiting on but God's waiting to get his
[1:32:43] church in order he's waiting on you and
[1:32:46] I may he grant that blessing what's he
[1:32:51] waiting for God is waiting now here's
[1:32:56] the emphasis will drop back the Old
[1:32:59] Testament Saints have not reached
[1:33:05] immortality you said I don't agree with
[1:33:07] that okay go ahead
[1:33:08] that's alright you show me how they can
[1:33:11] that's all I ask for when the Lord Jesus
[1:33:15] was the only one that reached
[1:33:16] immortality and brother branham verified
[1:33:19] it or cleared it up for it when he went
[1:33:21] beyond the curtain of time and he
[1:33:23] couldn't go where Jesus was
[1:33:24] he said well words all rest up Matt
[1:33:27] don't ask me but I know this has to be
[1:33:29] cubicles or something up in heaven
[1:33:31] places for these people to go because
[1:33:33] you've got foolish virgins you've got
[1:33:35] filled sealed you you've got a lot of
[1:33:37] things that God has to have a place for
[1:33:39] them to be because they're not dire
[1:33:41] we're talking about it yesterday he can
[1:33:44] run around and wet be under curtain or
[1:33:46] town he didn't see Paul's people he saw
[1:33:50] his people right why because the others
[1:33:54] was in another dimension and you can't
[1:33:56] put them in another dimension because
[1:33:58] you can only put them into six dimension
[1:33:59] so that six dimension must be
[1:34:01] monstrosity of people right because
[1:34:08] every Church ages there we get there in
[1:34:10] different places and brother Brennan
[1:34:14] went back there and saw his people he
[1:34:18] didn't see Paul's people he didn't see
[1:34:20] then he saw his own people and they told
[1:34:24] him he said do I have to go back and he
[1:34:28] said you know go back and they said well
[1:34:29] we're depending on that in other words
[1:34:33] what about this age depending on the
[1:34:36] Prophet but you see I can make it
[1:34:39] stronger than that from the foundation
[1:34:44] of the world to where we are today
[1:34:47] God was waiting to bring a message in
[1:34:51] this life days through a little man
[1:34:53] named William Branham to bring it to the
[1:34:56] basis of Malachi 4 and fulfill it he
[1:34:59] doesn't understand a lot of times if you
[1:35:04] don't believe me go read spoken words
[1:35:06] original seed he gets over there and he
[1:35:10] said Lord I got him out on a limb what
[1:35:13] can I do the Lord says pick up your pen
[1:35:17] and write he picks up his pen and rots
[1:35:20] and there is exactly his answer because
[1:35:23] in that he says as of yet God telling
[1:35:27] him he had to tell that prophet he said
[1:35:29] as of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled
[1:35:33] there's a brother I won't call it or to
[1:35:35] put it on the internet but as a brother
[1:35:37] that said at one time he said he said to
[1:35:39] brother Branham said brother Branham are
[1:35:41] you Malachi 4 you know is that your
[1:35:44] ministry he said yes
[1:35:45] he said what why don't you tell
[1:35:46] everybody he said I can't do it he
[1:35:52] couldn't go forth and tell it he had to
[1:35:55] keep moving slowly see and he didn't
[1:35:59] know his part but when he told he was
[1:36:02] forward reading a seed
[1:36:03] oh what a part he had to tell he said to
[1:36:07] think about that new birth if you're
[1:36:11] born of the word and spirit
[1:36:15] he said it puts you back like who should
[1:36:17] have been without the fall what a
[1:36:21] wonderful thing this message has
[1:36:23] declared unto us to look at it and see
[1:36:30] that you're now are not just sitting
[1:36:32] here waiting
[1:36:32] we have supposed to have been studying
[1:36:35] the message to prepare now I don't make
[1:36:39] statements to make it derogatory and
[1:36:42] make it hateful or anything but I do
[1:36:43] make straight statements if you're
[1:36:46] looking for brother Branham to come back
[1:36:47] and preach now I'm saying this if you
[1:36:54] don't know what he's already saying it
[1:36:55] what's any need of him coming back right
[1:37:03] is that is that trying to make a
[1:37:06] doctrine or an idea
[1:37:08] no it's telling the truth we've got to
[1:37:14] be prepared for whatever God does and
[1:37:20] see that's what I've been doing for 40
[1:37:23] years is trying to provide this church
[1:37:25] for a short ministry because I've always
[1:37:28] known what the Prophet says he said
[1:37:30] Jesus come to mount Transfiguration I
[1:37:33] mean unnoted from when I first read it
[1:37:35] he said he went straight to Calvary it's
[1:37:40] about six months difference between
[1:37:41] Mount of Transfiguration and Calvary and
[1:37:46] the Lord Jesus was heading towards his
[1:37:48] death and I've always said it because
[1:37:55] I've always believed this message if it
[1:37:59] don't take me and you to our death to
[1:38:01] our self then we're not in the message
[1:38:07] we're not in the message if it's not
[1:38:09] killed us I ain't meaning physically all
[1:38:13] right
[1:38:14] spiritually if that brought us to a
[1:38:18] place that we're dead to ourselves and
[1:38:19] walking in Christ then the message
[1:38:21] hadn't done us any good
[1:38:23] so you said brother down what do you
[1:38:25] expect in the message to do kill every
[1:38:27] one of us
[1:38:28] how many of you remember brother Fred
[1:38:31] Hooper you remember the Jim Jones
[1:38:34] situation that happened down there you
[1:38:35] know nothing and at that time they asked
[1:38:38] Fred don't work they said Fred said if
[1:38:40] Sam ever tried to get you to kill
[1:38:42] yourself
[1:38:43] he said everday that ever died all
[1:38:50] around he trying to get me to kill
[1:38:51] myself the work roschin live see that's
[1:38:59] what God's waiting on a church like that
[1:39:02] not the fact of you saying it I mean him
[1:39:05] saying you must say it let me find one
[1:39:07] in it then we'll quit okay well this is
[1:39:16] often the message adoption in in number
[1:39:19] 17 with with learners for expectation
[1:39:22] the whole creation is waiting for the
[1:39:23] manifestation the manifestation what is
[1:39:26] the manifestation making known the whole
[1:39:29] world the Muhammadans
[1:39:30] are we under there looking for it the
[1:39:35] Muhammadans are looking for the sons and
[1:39:39] daughters of God yeah cuz the whole
[1:39:40] world is waiting right there looking for
[1:39:44] it where is there those people or where
[1:39:50] is these people excuse me where's the
[1:39:53] people he's looking for but we fail to
[1:39:57] hear looking at all of those things fell
[1:40:00] to hear this steal small boys I'm
[1:40:07] looking for one specific
[1:40:16] is groaning waiting the whole world is
[1:40:19] waiting he's just waiting waiting now
[1:40:24] with his long suffering that his coming
[1:40:29] already past due waiting to get the
[1:40:33] church in order so the Second Coming can
[1:40:36] take place waiting on the church to get
[1:40:42] the Second Coming to come to pass I'm
[1:40:52] trying to find one certain quote if God
[1:40:56] be in you all that God was he poured
[1:40:59] into Christ and all Christ was he poured
[1:41:01] poured into the church so it's God above
[1:41:06] us God with us God in us we followed in
[1:41:09] a lot anything but listen and bring his
[1:41:12] people God kind of sending down making a
[1:41:17] way for me to get back and bring his
[1:41:21] people back to manifested sons of God
[1:41:24] like they had them in the manifestation
[1:41:28] of the sons you know in the Garden of
[1:41:31] Eden the whole world groaning waiting
[1:41:34] for that hour for the manifestation of
[1:41:37] sons of God he has no voice with our
[1:41:46] voice he has no hands with our hands
[1:42:01] he said I'm divine you're the branches I
[1:42:03] was looking for the one where he's
[1:42:05] talking about the Old Testament Saints
[1:42:06] but that's alright I'll find it can't
[1:42:09] even find something my own notes
[1:42:14] go ahead masseuse musicians coming here
[1:42:17] and I'll see if I can find that while
[1:42:19] you're coming cause I wanted to read
[1:42:20] down this is one I like Melchizedek the
[1:42:31] Great Prince number 11 when we're really
[1:42:38] when we rally dire with Abraham Isaac
[1:42:42] and Jacob those who were heirs of the
[1:42:46] promise looking forward to us not to
[1:42:51] fail
[1:42:55] you mean Abraham I don't know for
[1:42:59] without us they can not be made perfect
[1:43:02] looking for us not to fail you mean that
[1:43:09] all that happened down through there is
[1:43:11] gonna wind up with us sitting in church
[1:43:13] glory we're in the message we believe
[1:43:16] that everything we're ready for the Lord
[1:43:18] we just don't know what's holding it off
[1:43:21] I know what's holding it off me
