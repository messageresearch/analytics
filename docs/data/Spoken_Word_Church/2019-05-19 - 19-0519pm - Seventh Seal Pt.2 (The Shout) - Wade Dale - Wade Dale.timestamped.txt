[0:20] god bless the Hyneman when they ring the
[0:23] Golden Bell
[0:47] I sang this song in church when I was a
[0:49] very young teenager in front of about
[0:50] 600 people our church had about 600
[0:53] people and I still loved the song and I
[0:56] hope God blesses you with it when they
[1:04] ring the golden bells for you and me

[12:45] each one today Lord just give a
[12:46] supernatural strength and supernatural
[12:49] revelation we ask these things in Jesus
[12:51] name Amen
[12:53] all right and we were talking last
[12:56] Sunday on the Seventh Seal just trying
[12:58] to get the seal part out which there's
[13:00] really nothing to it just when the seal
[13:02] opened there was nothing there was
[13:03] silence in heaven right here verse 8 or
[13:06] 8 verse 1 and when he had opened the
[13:08] Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven
[13:09] about the space of a half an hour you
[13:12] may be seated in the Lord at his
[13:14] blessing to the reading of the word now
[13:16] with this being one of the greatest
[13:18] times that's ever been on the face of
[13:22] the earth brother Branham said he'd
[13:23] never worked in a greater realm he had
[13:26] seen many things go on in his ministry
[13:29] starting back in the early even in the
[13:32] in the 30s in the 40s 50s and 60s there
[13:37] early 60s but he was working in a realm
[13:39] that white had never he had never worked
[13:42] in that spear before why because the the
[13:45] totality of the word was opening up God
[13:47] was bringing something that he had not
[13:50] he had not given to any one man except
[13:54] the man himself Jesus Christ that when
[13:57] he was on the earth he preached the very
[14:00] word of God without any any error so now
[14:06] if Jesus Christ can come and preach
[14:09] three-and-a-half years with no error
[14:10] then certainly we should know that Jesus
[14:13] Christ coming back in the end time in a
[14:16] bride would do the same thing not have
[14:20] all this confusion that we have and all
[14:22] these different doctrines and we can do
[14:24] this and we can't do that when we go do
[14:25] this and you know they made the seventh
[14:28] seal the reason they made the seventh
[14:29] seal everything in the world but what
[14:31] it's supposed to be is because they
[14:33] don't have a revelation
[14:34] all right need to get a revelation
[14:36] you've got to really pray to God that
[14:39] he'll reveal this because like I said if
[14:41] I put the black ball
[14:42] today it would just stay blank the whole
[14:44] time
[14:46] there's nothing to write there's nothing
[14:49] to write on that board anymore no we've
[14:51] been through a whole year of writing
[14:53] things on the board and putting this up
[14:54] here and putting that up here but with
[14:57] the seventh seal that was silence in
[14:59] heaven so there's nothing to write it's
[15:01] just a whiteboard and it will stay that
[15:03] way because there's nothing else to be
[15:06] revealed as far as like we were talking
[15:08] about seal number one two three four and
[15:11] one each one meant we've come to a seal
[15:13] now to where it's a total mystery and
[15:16] even brother branham said said that that
[15:18] Satan is not even going to be able to in
[15:20] person they'll see Satan can impersonate
[15:22] a lot of things but when when you come
[15:25] up to a time where the word of God's
[15:27] preached in its fullness and its
[15:29] entirety and its maturity then we know
[15:33] one thing for sure Satan cannot
[15:34] impersonate that now he can go so far he
[15:39] can go so far and he can get so close
[15:41] because remember we're talking about
[15:43] Christ in you the hope of glory but
[15:44] remember the Bible says that there will
[15:46] be false Christ's false anointed ones in
[15:49] the end time they'll try their best to
[15:52] get so close but they'll never be able
[15:54] to break open the mystery of that seal
[15:57] you and I are the only people the people
[15:59] that are here at the end those who
[16:01] endure to the end shall be saved I still
[16:03] enjoy that that scripture there in
[16:05] Matthew because that's what it is it's
[16:07] going to be an endurance a you know it's
[16:09] there's gonna be battle-scarred veterans
[16:12] the prophet of God said this is not a
[16:14] picnic when it bring knives and forks we
[16:16] brought swords and shields and Spears to
[16:19] this battle and then you know why it's a
[16:22] battle for you to overcome just to come
[16:24] to church that's why it isn't overcome I
[16:27] may be really easy for us all to set
[16:29] home this morning in and you know made
[16:31] us a couple of eggs and a biscuit and
[16:33] turned the tape recorder on and hit play
[16:37] that has nothing in the Bible to do with
[16:42] your Christianity
[16:44] zero hone Sundy brother Brown said you
[16:48] can't wait till the doors open to get in
[16:51] church what to fellowship not with each
[16:53] other but to fellowship with God right
[16:56] and so to overcome it was an overcoming
[16:59] battle for us to get up and have to come
[17:01] it's an overcoming battle for you to sit
[17:04] here without going to sleep
[17:05] hey man right so I preach to the
[17:08] overcomers you just get the regular ones
[17:10] that come I get all the overcomers well
[17:14] some don't that he does that's right
[17:17] that would thank you that's good
[17:19] yep brother Dale helps you to overcome
[17:21] to get to this point yeah but really
[17:25] enjoying the series there this morning
[17:27] if you don't know if you don't know
[17:29] anything about being being spiritual
[17:31] that goes right with what we're talking
[17:33] about right now right here same you
[17:36] there is no way you can get you can get
[17:40] out of the seals and then out of the
[17:43] Bible it's all in the Bible it all is
[17:46] the part of salvation it's a part of
[17:49] your Redemption in my Redemption all
[17:52] right it has nothing to do with this
[17:55] outside world because the seven seals
[17:56] are to us now sure it occupies I mean it
[18:01] happens out there but now right now none
[18:05] of that is happening you don't see the
[18:07] Antichrist has not become incarnate yet
[18:10] he's working toward it but what God is
[18:14] doing is he's becoming incarnate in us
[18:17] at first and then Satan's going to do so
[18:21] see we get we get even even though we
[18:24] we're not going to be here when the
[18:25] actual play happens we're actually the
[18:28] participants where were the recipients
[18:31] of all this we get to see the the
[18:33] preview you know and when you watch
[18:35] movies they give you a trailer give you
[18:38] a little snippet of what's going on well
[18:39] this is not a trailer this is not just a
[18:41] snippet this is the movie this is the
[18:44] preview God's already previewing what's
[18:47] going to happen through us and then it's
[18:49] going to happen to the outside world now
[18:51] we've been through that many many times
[18:53] even in the sixth seal how the
[18:55] disruption of nature is going
[18:57] happen because of you what are you
[18:59] saying brother wait listen the seventh
[19:00] seals not going to open without you
[19:02] oh yeah it's open to the airwaves and
[19:07] it's been preached by the Prophet and
[19:08] and it's been revealed to him I would
[19:10] say what was going on but he found out
[19:13] he wasn't a real recipient of it it's
[19:14] just gonna be the ones that are here now
[19:16] that are alive and remained because the
[19:18] seven seals not to the sixth dimension
[19:20] it's to this dimension all the seals are
[19:24] to this dimension and it's in your
[19:25] dimension that you're gonna be able to
[19:27] see it
[19:27] amen so it is for all of us it's not
[19:31] something that we can we can't shun this
[19:34] we can't kick it over to the side this
[19:37] is something you and I have to
[19:38] participate in this the seven seals is
[19:42] the mystery of everything that's been
[19:45] holed up in the Bible has been revealed
[19:48] to you and I it's been brought to us now
[19:51] we've had 50 something years 60 years
[19:53] since the prophets gone and what have we
[19:55] done I don't think we've went up the
[19:57] elevator far enough I was telling this
[20:00] morning where I was kind of you know
[20:04] sometimes you sit back and go well God
[20:05] why'd you send this message I mean well
[20:06] we know why but then you look at and say
[20:09] well you know what came to me was is
[20:12] you've got this big beautiful skyscraper
[20:14] and and this thing they build it you
[20:16] know 100 and something storeys high and
[20:18] it's really pretty but what's the
[20:21] essence of that of that building that
[20:23] building sure number one is there's not
[20:25] enough space so they're gonna let you
[20:26] you know build vertically but it's the
[20:30] view you go up to the top of this and
[20:34] you have a view or you see more than
[20:38] you've ever seen before when you get to
[20:40] the top I think josh has been to the
[20:41] Empire State Building have you yes josh
[20:43] is putting an interstate building twice
[20:45] and I mean you can see forever because
[20:49] you're up there but how did you get up
[20:50] there and sister Trudy McMillan said
[20:53] well steps I said well if you want to go
[20:54] 150 floors and steps you go right ahead
[20:56] but God's give us an elevator we've got
[21:00] an elevator that goes all the way to the
[21:03] top and then you know if you ever rode
[21:04] in an elevator like when I was in the
[21:05] Philippines you're you know you get into
[21:07] elevator and there's a guy standing
[21:09] there or
[21:10] girl that matches the buttons for you
[21:12] that's kind of a perk of being in a
[21:15] five-star restaurant
[21:16] but brother wishing normally get so high
[21:18] you can only go to a certain level
[21:19] because the rest of that's private it's
[21:22] for the penthouse this for the people
[21:24] that pay more than you paid but you know
[21:27] what that little girl you don't have a
[21:28] key but that little girl of that guy
[21:30] he's got a key or he's got a code that
[21:33] when you go to for 142 there's eight
[21:36] more floors left well now you don't get
[21:39] a real good view at flow 142 but now at
[21:43] 150 if when you walk out on top of that
[21:45] penthouse but you gotta have somebody
[21:46] there to turn the key that's why God
[21:48] sent a prophet God didn't send a prophet
[21:51] for us to become religious God didn't
[21:54] send a prophet to tell us how to dress
[21:56] and how to do all that sure he had to do
[21:58] it because a man because of man putting
[22:01] their ideas in it brother brown did
[22:04] changed the Bible I'm sure he met people
[22:09] he said he met people that had the Holy
[22:11] Ghost the same as as he did in a long
[22:14] time before the message see sometimes we
[22:16] think the message is this whole know the
[22:19] message is what we're talking about
[22:20] today the essence of the message or the
[22:23] opening of those seven seals something
[22:25] that's never been where that man had to
[22:27] turn that key so we could go on up for
[22:28] that eight more floors or ever how many
[22:31] floors let's say seven let's stay with
[22:33] number seven seven more floors so that
[22:35] we can see what night wasn't that there
[22:38] was nothing there the landscape has
[22:42] always been there
[22:43] right and that's why I say with the word
[22:46] of God the landscapes already been there
[22:48] God wrote this Bible a long time ago
[22:50] we're just thinning the image that he
[22:53] saw and it's become a reality because
[22:56] remember Jesus Christ was a lamb slain
[22:59] before the foundation of the world right
[23:00] is that good enough that's not good
[23:05] enough that was in his mind Christ had
[23:09] to come down here and physically do it
[23:11] because it was the mind of God it had to
[23:14] develop God doesn't have a thought that
[23:16] that well I'll think of listening oh no
[23:18] that's not the way you want to do that
[23:20] way let's try another way no God's
[23:22] thoughts are eternal
[23:23] so as his thought goes out it's got to
[23:25] happen and he became material one day
[23:29] 2,000 years ago that this man we called
[23:31] Jesus Christ came on the earth and he
[23:33] was literally crucified so that you and
[23:36] I could see it by our faith we see it
[23:41] amen we see that Christ was crucified
[23:44] and he was crucified not for you he's
[23:46] crucified for me and you got to feel the
[23:48] same way because it's a personal
[23:50] revelation as brother Dale is talking
[23:52] about the new birth is a personal
[23:54] revelation of Jesus Christ to you a
[23:57] personal revelation something that you
[23:59] can take and hang on to and sometimes
[24:01] you can when you walk out the doors of
[24:03] this church you still got it
[24:04] man that's what I like you still got it
[24:07] when you go out there and get on the job
[24:09] and you got y'all you still got it when
[24:11] you're out there and you got the storms
[24:13] of life or beating against your against
[24:15] your ship you still got it a man is
[24:18] still there to hold on to you where you
[24:20] don't hold on to it a lot of times that
[24:21] holds on to you so talking about the
[24:27] simple plan of salvation is what this
[24:29] seal is all about you said well it's the
[24:33] greatest thing said what's the greatest
[24:35] thing ever happened to you salvation the
[24:39] greatest thing ever happened to you is
[24:41] you got born again and then you say well
[24:44] I know it's the change of the body if
[24:46] you don't get born again first you can
[24:48] forget about the change of the body
[24:49] forget about the journey down through
[24:51] the road down the road the over comings
[24:53] and all that because there's got to be
[24:55] over cuz you've got to overcome a lot of
[24:56] things but when you get down to the end
[24:58] of the road that's when your body's
[24:59] gonna be changed well listen we're
[25:00] almost down to the end of that road now
[25:02] something had to come to us though to
[25:05] turn us to turn us not not just turn now
[25:09] I just turn us to well I used to smoke
[25:11] now I don't I used to cut my hair now I
[25:13] don't I used to wear makeup now I don't
[25:15] that's not what this message is all
[25:17] about folks it's not that's what we have
[25:23] spent 50 years majoring on a minor
[25:28] we have majored on people not doing this
[25:31] and doing this and not doing that and
[25:33] we've not got down into the depth of the
[25:35] message - what brother Brown -
[25:37] true essence of this message is that you
[25:40] and I are there's going to be a
[25:41] resurrection and a body change and it's
[25:43] going to come through you and me it's
[25:46] gonna come through you and me it's not
[25:48] gonna come through a book or a special
[25:51] tape no it's gonna come through what you
[25:54] have inside of you when Jesus walked up
[25:58] to the tomb of Lazarus
[25:59] he'd have to pray he had already seen it
[26:03] happen four days ago he didn't have to
[26:06] pray but you know what he said he's a
[26:07] father for the people around me what the
[26:09] weak ones around me
[26:11] I'm gonna pray this prayer but in other
[26:13] words he should have just walked up and
[26:14] said move out of the way Lazarus come
[26:18] out of the grave I know that's it
[26:20] essentially that's what happened anyway
[26:22] all right so that's what we have to come
[26:24] to I was telling them this morning I
[26:25] think that that our Commission should be
[26:29] that we brother Brown tells us and I'll
[26:32] read it it's gonna be on a part of
[26:34] another service besides this one where
[26:36] he's trying to get the people into
[26:38] speaking condition that's something you
[26:42] need to keep in your in your back of
[26:43] your head speaking condition you so I'm
[26:47] I'm what are you gonna put your little
[26:51] whatever's in the blank
[26:52] I'm insufficient I'm I'm I'm embarrassed
[26:56] I'm ashamed well don't worry about that
[27:00] I'm a child of God and I'm gonna do what
[27:04] the Bible says because I have got the I
[27:06] am inside of me and that's what's gonna
[27:08] work out and that's what's with you and
[27:10] I the same thing we've been to these all
[27:12] these great waves and different things
[27:14] that we've come to but we're gonna have
[27:16] to come to see that that if we don't get
[27:19] this and we'll get to in a second about
[27:20] the shout when somebody shouts what do
[27:24] you do
[27:25] I mean if brother Ryan no ain't no way
[27:28] he'll shout if breath if no brother
[27:32] Anderson either they ain't nobody back
[27:33] there that Boyd yeah thank you sure it's
[27:36] sterling with if brother Boyd were to
[27:39] shout right in the middle of the sermon
[27:41] and y'all didn't know anything about it
[27:42] and he just all of a sudden got up and
[27:44] said I don't know if that really then
[27:46] what would your attention would be
[27:48] turned to him
[27:50] why because you heard something that you
[27:53] weren't expecting and ma'am so we'll get
[27:56] into that in just a second so let's read
[27:58] John 19 because this remembered last
[28:01] Sunday we were talking about the number
[28:04] seven I hope yeah if y'all do all
[28:05] weren't here Sunday and you want to get
[28:07] that list that I've pulled off of the
[28:10] internet about the number seven there's
[28:12] several of them right here on the front
[28:14] row if you want to pick them up
[28:15] and sister cleda found out she was born
[28:18] the same day Adam was same year sister
[28:27] Clara is she she calls on the phone and
[28:30] she just left my grandmother my
[28:32] grandmother used to call and she said
[28:33] wait I need you to cut the grass grandma
[28:39] grandma grandma nope
[28:41] that's what she wanted you to do and she
[28:43] hung the phone up there wasn't nobody
[28:45] forced you hung her phone so clean a
[28:46] call though that I hung my phone she
[28:47] said I just want you to know that that's
[28:50] the same man Adam going on the same or
[28:52] that same day that I was born Dale Adam
[28:54] was born his young phone
[28:57] - me this morning she did you get my
[28:59] message I said I got it loud and clear
[29:05] lady a few words and that's okay but we
[29:12] were talking about the segment about the
[29:14] number seven but then we got into where
[29:16] brother Branham will read in a minute
[29:17] cuz I want you to keep this in your back
[29:19] to your mind cuz we got to fit this
[29:21] puzzle together
[29:21] brother Brown said the Seventh Seal is
[29:23] the end of all things now the end of all
[29:25] things does not mean remember with God
[29:28] and end it's not a total annihilation
[29:33] because even when he can't we come to
[29:36] the end of the world everybody talks
[29:37] about the end of the world well now
[29:40] listen the end of the world is just the
[29:42] beginning of the world that God's gonna
[29:43] produce amen yeah man the end of the
[29:47] play even when you come to the end of
[29:49] the play and there's no more acts what
[29:51] do you do you have that play to remember
[29:54] you have all the motions that got you to
[29:56] the very end of the play and it was just
[29:59] an end of that scene so this is just an
[30:02] end of the scene just like brother
[30:04] Dale's tell about this morning your life
[30:06] in my life when it comes to if it does
[30:09] come to an end that's just the beginning
[30:12] for a Christian it has come to an
[30:14] earthly end and even when Jesus said
[30:16] hear Jesus therefore receive the venery
[30:18] vinegar he said it is finished bowed his
[30:21] head and gave up the ghost now there was
[30:22] not one other word said not one other
[30:26] word said by Jesus Christ himself in
[30:29] this dimension until he walked out of
[30:31] the tomb on Sunday morning but now
[30:33] remember one thing according to the
[30:35] world nothing was going on I said
[30:39] according to the world nothing was going
[30:41] on they had already put this guy this
[30:44] lunatic was dead he was in a tomb they
[30:48] had sealed it up and put a Roman seal on
[30:51] it sealed that baby up and put guards
[30:53] beside just to make sure nobody got in
[30:55] there to get him out right so he was
[30:58] dead to the world he was dead there was
[31:01] nothing going on that Saturday was a
[31:03] high silence so all of your Caiaphas and
[31:06] all those different priests they had to
[31:08] do the Passover lamb they had to do
[31:10] judi they had to do whatever they did on
[31:14] the on the high Sabbath is with the
[31:15] Passover and all that and then it was a
[31:18] day a Sabbath day so they just continued
[31:22] on Jerusalem and the whole world just
[31:24] continued on just as they were not sure
[31:27] there was a small group of people but
[31:29] now remember even that small group of
[31:31] people that were Jesus's closest closest
[31:34] followers thought he was dead right they
[31:39] thought he was dead
[31:40] it was done it was over with I heard the
[31:42] one that we thought was going to come in
[31:44] and take over the world he's gone and
[31:48] we've never seen somebody come out of a
[31:52] tomb like that not sure now they might
[31:53] have stood around at Lazarus tomb and
[31:55] saw Lazarus raised from the dead
[31:56] but eventually Lazarus was gonna die
[31:58] again alright so they weren't looking
[32:01] listen to what I'm saying is they
[32:02] weren't looking for anything special
[32:03] they weren't looking for anything
[32:05] supernatural their Lord had died whoever
[32:07] that was that they thought he was the
[32:09] Messiah you see all the doubt that Satan
[32:12] puts in the mind when when we get to
[32:14] looking at things on the surface and we
[32:16] say he's dead just like right now I'm
[32:19] telling you everybody takes well the
[32:21] words dead there's nothing going on
[32:22] there's no there's no great move of God
[32:25] well the great move of God better be
[32:28] inside of you that great move of God
[32:31] better be something that on Monday
[32:33] morning you get up and say God thank you
[32:35] for getting me up tell me something else
[32:36] about you hey man and then you know what
[32:40] the world is not gonna know anything
[32:42] about it but God he was dead
[32:44] the body was cold dead in the grave on
[32:49] Saturday all day Saturday it was until
[32:54] dead and you know what the people could
[32:56] walk by they see that ceiling they see
[32:58] the guard standing there and they see
[32:59] that seals stuck up there nothing was
[33:02] going on but the greatest thing in the
[33:04] world was happening is this man called
[33:07] Jesus Christ was now in his theophany he
[33:09] had went to another dimension to fulfill
[33:12] Scripture to preach to the souls that
[33:14] were in prison
[33:15] what condemning that group of people but
[33:18] then he steps into paradise another
[33:20] dimension and picks up all those people
[33:23] in paradise
[33:24] and takes them wherever they go so he
[33:26] wasn't was he busy absolutely there was
[33:29] no there's no time that God's not busy
[33:31] we're talking about God being you know
[33:33] taking a rest day the seventh day my he
[33:36] hasn't rested he just rested from making
[33:38] everything amen
[33:40] he rested from the creation God's never
[33:42] had to rest thank God for that can you
[33:44] imagine us being in a glorified body
[33:46] Colette's exactly what you and I are
[33:47] going to believe we're not ever gonna
[33:49] have to rest if we sit down it's because
[33:52] we want to and when we stand up brother
[33:56] Holly won't be will have to get up in
[33:57] parts right how many of y'all are to the
[34:03] point to where you have to get up and
[34:04] shifts oh yeah yeah you have to get up
[34:07] and shift legs legs move one of them
[34:14] goes off amen
[34:16] second one goes off then you say back
[34:19] can you get me up yeah then you stand
[34:22] down June June will stand up for me and
[34:24] she'll go and then she'll start walking
[34:29] I think she's getting her get she's
[34:30] getting in gear so she can so she can
[34:33] move but but that's what we got to look
[34:35] forward to because you know what when
[34:37] this thing is over with we ain't got to
[34:38] do that in the morning so that's why
[34:40] we're heading toward that body change
[34:42] that us older people are looking more
[34:44] forward to than the younger ones the
[34:49] time goes on you younger ones to realize
[34:51] that you have to get up in shifts so
[34:55] Jesus was dead I mean it looked like
[34:56] there was nothing going on same thing
[34:58] when you come to this great Seventh Seal
[35:00] like I said no blackboard with nothing
[35:03] on it
[35:04] whiteboard with nothing on it so where
[35:05] you going you go man this is the board
[35:07] this thing never happened well it's the
[35:09] greatest thing that ever happened
[35:10] because what God's doing is is God has
[35:13] moved us into the Holy of Holies where
[35:17] remember the Holy of Holies unless
[35:18] somebody told them what was back there
[35:20] nobody saw what was in that Holy of
[35:22] Holies is that one person and then he
[35:25] had to come out and tell you what was
[35:28] going on inside there but now what
[35:30] happens now that when Christ has died
[35:33] and come back in the form of the Holy
[35:34] Ghost inside of you then that Holy of
[35:37] Holies
[35:37] has been opened up the the veil was
[35:40] ripped from top to bottom they ought to
[35:42] realize something in that temple only
[35:45] something supernatural could have rent a
[35:47] 20-foot veil from top to bottom now from
[35:50] bottom to top you could have done it you
[35:52] could got to people and pulled it but if
[35:54] things 20-foot high God ripped that
[35:57] thing open to show in plain view what
[35:59] the Seventh Seal or Christ Jesus Christ
[36:02] hanging on the cross but when he said it
[36:04] is finished we've got to get to a place
[36:08] to where we see the word finished and
[36:09] end and all that now what do you and I
[36:11] think of we think of you know done but
[36:15] listen when we get to the end of this
[36:16] service is that end does that end
[36:19] everything no you got to go outside
[36:21] fellowship get in your car go home get
[36:23] up tomorrow go back to work we've ended
[36:26] this service but we've not ended life
[36:30] and even when your life ends and we
[36:33] looked at you and say well they look
[36:35] just really nice there's nothing going
[36:39] on in this dimension but they're over
[36:42] there in another dimension shouting and
[36:44] praising God and meeting all the ones
[36:46] that are already over there so when we
[36:48] get to this the seventh seal is the end
[36:50] of all things we must remember that it
[36:53] is only the beginning of the greatest
[36:56] thing that will ever happen to you and
[36:57] that'll be your body changing and then
[36:59] the greatest thing that will happen and
[37:01] it'll have to come from nothing external
[37:03] will change your body we've tried to do
[37:06] that before we were talking about stuff
[37:08] downstairs you know if you don't have a
[37:09] hair put some hair on if you don't have
[37:11] teeth put teeth in you know all these
[37:12] thing you do that because you're human
[37:14] because you do it on this side okay but
[37:18] now God's not that way God's adding all
[37:21] the time he's adding should be at should
[37:23] be adding to your spiritual walk every
[37:26] day some little something some little
[37:29] some little way and and maybe even your
[37:33] husband or wife or you children don't
[37:35] know anything about it at the time but
[37:37] something's going on inside of you and
[37:40] Manco that's the real person is the real
[37:41] user once inside we're brother Branham
[37:43] said I'm not looking at the real youth
[37:44] he said you're not looking at the real
[37:46] man the real me is inside here and
[37:49] that's what God's doing
[37:51] that's what I'm telling you the greatest
[37:52] mystery the great mystery of revelations
[37:55] ten seven when the mysteries to be
[37:58] revealed is that God sent a prophet to
[38:00] tell you your God take seals vials
[38:06] plagues Daniel seventy weeks all the
[38:08] great marriage and divorce boil it down
[38:11] to one thing
[38:12] God's gonna do all that through somebody
[38:15] in human flesh and Satan can't stand it
[38:19] cuz remember what brother Brown said
[38:21] brother Brown said if I long as I hide
[38:23] it where'd he hide it he's not hiding in
[38:25] a in a box or hiding it in a book
[38:28] he's hiding it in his heart he says long
[38:31] as I hide something in my heart he said
[38:33] the devil he can't get in there said but
[38:35] now when I start speaking it out and I
[38:36] say I'm gonna go this way he said you
[38:38] want kids we'll start crying and you
[38:41] know mother-in-law's will come over and
[38:43] father-in-law's will come over and all
[38:45] these things will happen you know right
[38:46] brother Anderson said yesterday man you
[38:51] didn't have to raise your hand brother
[38:56] that's all right gotta have him what
[38:59] about Solomon he had a thousand wives
[39:00] and a thousand mother-in-law and he was
[39:05] the wisest man on earth that's why it
[39:09] was wise he had a thousand
[39:11] mother-in-law's we'll talk about that
[39:14] one after church Ephesians 4:30 says
[39:17] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God will
[39:18] buy your sealed until the day of your
[39:20] Redemption as brother Dale's talking
[39:22] about now and I wanna I didn't oh I did
[39:27] I brought the quote listen to this you
[39:28] don't have this so just listen to it
[39:30] it's on the breach a seal signifies now
[39:33] this word I got from the dictionary a
[39:34] seal signifies a finished work alright
[39:38] and when the seventh seal is broken the
[39:41] mystery of God mystery one mystery of
[39:43] God that sealed in these mysterious
[39:46] seals is finished until the day that
[39:50] seal is broken then it's revealed what's
[39:53] on the inside of it
[39:55] listen if the man's wondering what's in
[39:58] that boxcar you say it's supposed to be
[39:59] such and such they're supposed to be
[40:01] he's presuming but
[40:04] when the seal is broken and the door is
[40:06] open we see into it then and see exactly
[40:10] what's in there you see and that only be
[40:13] done at the end time and that's exactly
[40:15] what's happened it's been sealed you
[40:18] have been sealed but you've got to be
[40:20] able to produce what's inside amen we
[40:24] will every person will produce what they
[40:27] are inside you won't be able to help it
[40:29] not in the end time you can hide it in
[40:31] different places but you can't hide it
[40:33] now you will be made known one way or
[40:36] the other
[40:37] either God or the devil so let's read
[40:40] this right here real quick number one
[40:42] we're just gonna go over a few uh a few
[40:46] from last Sunday if that's all right
[40:48] review it just a little bit let's go
[40:50] down to where it says this is
[40:53] revelations chapter five I love this
[40:54] quote he breaks the seals go down to the
[40:56] rib or up to the red he breaks the seals
[40:59] reveals gives us his inheritance to his
[41:01] people he gives the inheritance that he
[41:04] inherited becoming kinsman redeemer and
[41:07] freely gives it out to us it all belong
[41:10] to him and he's the one who redeemed but
[41:14] instead of keeping it his self he gives
[41:16] it back to his people
[41:18] that's his love for us now we know what
[41:20] now he didn't have to inherit eternal
[41:22] life in his spirit or his soul he was
[41:24] Almighty God he was eternal life but he
[41:28] inherited eternal life in his body he
[41:31] went through that process well remember
[41:33] when we were talking about the silence
[41:34] the sigh Jesus Christ's body was laying
[41:37] there cold and dead but that was it was
[41:40] getting ready to produce something that
[41:42] had never been produced before when that
[41:46] Christ came back into that body it
[41:49] changed that body into an eternal body
[41:54] that's the inheritance that he inherited
[41:57] by going and doing what the scripture
[41:59] said because remember brother Brown said
[42:01] God was withheld by his own word in that
[42:06] three days period right he couldn't come
[42:11] out because the Bible says he will not
[42:13] leave a soul in Hell neither stuff with
[42:15] my Holy One to see corruption
[42:17] so he had to wait go and do the work
[42:19] that he was doing and then when he come
[42:22] back and brother aid when he when he
[42:24] stepped in that body it changed that
[42:26] body into a young eternal person and he
[42:32] inherited that and now he's going to
[42:35] freely give it to me and you it's just
[42:37] what the problem is is we've had to wait
[42:38] 2,000 years and it seems like they're
[42:41] silenced it seems like there's nothing
[42:43] happening oh sure they had great
[42:45] revivals but they're all dead
[42:47] Wesley Luke or all those people they're
[42:50] all in a grave I mean they're all their
[42:52] bodies in the grave but they're over in
[42:53] another dimension waiting on one group
[42:56] of people one group of people to catch
[42:59] this mystery sure they knew that Christ
[43:02] was in them the hope of glory they could
[43:04] read the Bible but they didn't get the
[43:06] hold they didn't have the guy that
[43:08] turned the key to get them on up seven
[43:10] more floors to get the seven seals open
[43:13] to where you get to the seventh seal and
[43:14] all you do is you see just what as far
[43:16] as you want to see a man and that's what
[43:18] I think that's what the Bible when they
[43:21] become a brand-new book to the Prophet
[43:22] it's become a brand-new book to me and
[43:24] it should become a brand-new book to you
[43:25] it should be where you when you read
[43:27] this Bible I'll promise you if you'll
[43:30] read the Bible with a Holy Ghost
[43:32] revelation you will say in yourself
[43:35] where did that come from
[43:38] cuz I just read that the other day
[43:41] I think somebody added something that's
[43:43] how much you'll read that and you'll
[43:45] think man I've read that 14 or 15 times
[43:47] and all of a sudden right I'm have you
[43:50] done that you just just you almost swear
[43:53] that wasn't in there two weeks ago
[43:55] why because God's bringing you step by
[43:57] step as you need it and that's the same
[44:00] way with these seven seals he didn't
[44:02] just drop the seven seals not 7th
[44:04] ceilings preach on it no he started with
[44:07] one two three four because remember
[44:09] seven is his completion or his perfect
[44:11] number and we'll read that but he breaks
[44:14] the seals and gives us the inheritance
[44:16] so that inheritance that break in that
[44:19] seventh seal is eternal life in your
[44:21] body
[44:22] you already got eternal life in your
[44:25] body I mean it's our life of your body
[44:28] amen
[44:31] folks were either heading to that and
[44:33] we're heading to agree because we're not
[44:36] going to keep going on and and this is
[44:38] going to stay the way it is it's gonna
[44:40] be one of the two all right so let's
[44:42] read the next one the breech number two
[44:44] now when we go to breaking the seals
[44:46] you're gonna see it goes plumb back in
[44:48] the scripture all the way back
[44:50] well now what does he go back to it goes
[44:52] all the way back to Genesis we're gonna
[44:55] say that brother Donnie this is not far
[44:57] from that Genesis 1:26 man when the
[45:01] seals are broke you're gonna see that
[45:02] Genesis 1:26 man is you it's you because
[45:07] that's Christ but it's you then when we
[45:12] get into breaking these seals you're
[45:13] gonna see it goes plumb back in the
[45:15] scripture all the way back for each one
[45:17] of these seals the whole thing together
[45:19] the whole mystery now if you want to
[45:22] know mystery you're met the mystery is
[45:24] Christ in you the hope of glory the
[45:26] mystery in you is is that your body is
[45:29] going to be changed while you're
[45:30] standing here alive the whole mystery
[45:33] lays right here in these seals not any
[45:36] other things not new years of
[45:38] preparation not let no in the seals see
[45:43] every mystery of the Bible lays in these
[45:46] seals and the seals cannot be broken
[45:49] until that time what this time alright
[45:52] notice now the book remember seal here's
[45:54] one here's a seal it's a book of
[45:57] redemption
[45:57] so anything when you talk about seven
[45:59] seals that's why that people they make
[46:05] it everything in the book but Redemption
[46:07] because you know what redemption is too
[46:08] simple for people supposed to be
[46:11] supposed to be well that's just getting
[46:13] saved brother wait that's just you know
[46:14] turning a new leaf or that's just crying
[46:17] and shouting why brother that's just you
[46:18] know laundry list that's I believe in
[46:21] the message no it's not you can believe
[46:25] its message every day you're laughing
[46:27] you're dying go to hell but you can't
[46:30] have the one that brought the message
[46:32] inside of you you can't have the one
[46:36] that brought this message inside of you
[46:38] and dying go to hell I'll promise you
[46:39] that cuz it'll take you right to heaven
[46:42] and
[46:44] whole thing together makes the book but
[46:45] it's the book of redemption so
[46:46] everything we need to think about it's
[46:48] just like I said before it should be the
[46:50] book of redemption from Genesis to
[46:52] revelations a complete plan of
[46:54] redemption is revealed in these seven
[46:57] seals oh it's an important time god help
[47:00] us to get and I see that was on the
[47:01] breach brother Graham hadn't even
[47:03] started on the seals and my when he
[47:06] started in them did he have a did he
[47:08] have a shock cuz all the one yeah all
[47:12] the old notes he used to have he had to
[47:14] throw them away this is all new to me
[47:18] said this there's not anything compared
[47:20] to what I had before
[47:21] Wow but you know once he had it he gave
[47:25] it to me in you so you and I should have
[47:28] it the same way if God corrected the
[47:30] prophet and brought the word to us what
[47:32] is our problem he's brought the pure
[47:36] word let's just do what he says
[47:38] number three look what we've seen in
[47:42] this day the quickening power has come
[47:45] to us to open the Seventh Seal now like
[47:48] I said last Sunday now when you say
[47:51] quickening power that goes back to that
[47:53] old Pentecostal idea that we have that
[47:55] we got to be speaking in tongues
[47:57] shouting throwing hair pins and all that
[48:00] other stuff right all of that quickening
[48:03] none of that happened during the whole
[48:05] week of opening the seals sure they
[48:08] rejoice and had a good time amen but
[48:10] there was no brother Brown had a healing
[48:12] service after the questions and answers
[48:15] right and it was just laying hands on
[48:17] the people there wasn't so much
[48:18] discernment or hardly anything he would
[48:20] just lay hands on the people and going
[48:22] through the line so what what is the
[48:24] quickening power it's the opening it's
[48:26] God coming in opening the seals and
[48:28] bringing them to you what was it the
[48:31] intelligence of a man no the quickening
[48:34] power of God see when you get a
[48:36] revelation from God it has to come from
[48:38] God number one and it has to be
[48:40] something that quickens you God don't
[48:42] just that's all the way in you you know
[48:44] you get a revelation is that God has
[48:46] quickened something in your life because
[48:48] it has to be personally to you so I
[48:50] can't say well I got the same revelation
[48:52] brother ray did that's the same exact
[48:54] time he did no that's he's personal and
[48:56] he
[48:56] person he's a person God can reveal to
[48:59] him tomorrow what God's revealed to me
[49:01] today God can reveal to him tomorrow
[49:02] God's sovereign but God knows when you
[49:05] need it and that's the whole thing
[49:08] God knew when we needed this he brought
[49:11] it through brother Branham he brought
[49:13] the quickening power to open the book up
[49:15] well now who closed the book back come
[49:19] on our problem is we closed the book
[49:21] back off well God came on the day of
[49:23] Pentecost he came down with a quickening
[49:25] power he must have left I don't think
[49:29] he's ever left when God comes down he
[49:33] don't ever go back up unless he takes up
[49:34] with him because he's coming down here
[49:37] in the shout we're getting to in just a
[49:39] minute he's descending with a shout so
[49:42] that you can hear it he's not shouting
[49:47] so the whole world can hear it now
[49:50] what's happening when we leave that seal
[49:53] that opens the whole world's gonna hear
[49:55] it officially through those two prophets
[49:57] in the sixth seal the whole world's
[49:58] gonna be against them two people but
[50:00] you're not gonna be gone and there's not
[50:02] even going to be listen there's not even
[50:03] going to be a mention of spoken word
[50:05] Church in the newspaper that's ain't
[50:07] nobody there anymore right there's not
[50:11] gonna be in the Gainesville Times
[50:13] they're not gonna write an article said
[50:14] well we don't know about lose the church
[50:16] now they've had a hundred people now
[50:18] ain't nobody see their I believe all
[50:20] y'all go making you didn't catch that
[50:24] did you you should have said Amen but
[50:25] you look but the church is empty let's
[50:30] write an article now they'll never even
[50:31] know we're gone maybe just tell me you
[50:34] acquaintances how many family members
[50:36] might know you're gone but the world's
[50:38] not gonna know we're gone all right
[50:41] let's go to number no let's go down to
[50:44] the oh my god quickening power has come
[50:49] to us to open the seven seals
[50:50] what was that the intelligence of a man
[50:52] no the quickening power of God now look
[50:56] going down to the red keep going he is
[50:59] the one who opened those seals he is
[51:02] those seals but the whole Word of God is
[51:05] Christ so what is the seal what is the
[51:09] opening
[51:10] the seals damn brother branham revealing
[51:13] Christ and where is Christ right now who
[51:19] said are you thank you
[51:21] oh yeah sure freedom okay
[51:27] no really revealing Christ
[51:30] and where's Christ Christ in you the
[51:33] hope of glory so where is this revealing
[51:36] of the cells in you I'm standing fall
[51:40] here all day and have that blank board
[51:43] in front of us it'd be more silence in
[51:44] heaven for hours not just 30 minutes
[51:48] why because I couldn't say anything
[51:50] about what was on that board
[51:51] you couldn't either but if God reveals
[51:54] something to you he can tell you and
[51:56] your secret of your heart and you can
[51:58] keep that thing and we do that he's the
[52:01] one who opened those seals he is those
[52:03] seals for the whole Word of God is
[52:04] Christ and Christ is the seals that was
[52:06] opened
[52:07] what is the opening of seals then
[52:10] revealing Christ now that's own it is
[52:15] the rising of the Sun in 1965 preached
[52:18] after the seals were open so he ought to
[52:20] know what he's talking about now let's
[52:22] go to number 4 the seventh seal we must
[52:26] remember that this seventh seal is the
[52:28] end of time of all things that's what
[52:30] we've been talking about that's right
[52:31] the things written in the seventh sealed
[52:33] book sealed up of the plan of redemption
[52:35] from before the foundation of the world
[52:37] it every bit ends it is the end it's the
[52:41] end of the struggling world it's the end
[52:43] of struggling nature it's the end of
[52:46] everything and there is the end of the
[52:48] trumpets remember all trumpets sounding
[52:50] on the sixth seal amen and the seventh
[52:53] trumpet and the seventh seal is the same
[52:55] we'll get into that later on it's the
[52:57] end of the vials it's the end of the
[53:00] earth now if you take that right there
[53:02] then brother Brown was wrong when he
[53:03] preaches the future home when he says
[53:07] it's not gonna be annihilated it's gonna
[53:09] be renovated we're gonna have a new
[53:13] heaven and a new earth but it's not
[53:14] going to be this earth blown away and
[53:16] God create a new one no it'll be the end
[53:19] of the earth the way we know
[53:21] amen it's the end of the vowels that's
[53:24] the end of the earth it's even the end
[53:26] of time time runs out the Bible said so
[53:29] remember in Revelations 10 7 everything
[53:33] runs out in this time the end of the end
[53:36] of this seventh seal so I don't want you
[53:39] to see something we're going to read
[53:41] several quotes here we're brother
[53:43] Branham talks to end of the seventh seal
[53:45] so the seventh seal is not just I I
[53:48] think that sometimes we take well the
[53:50] seventh still open no it's a
[53:54] continuation right it's a continuation
[53:56] it if you want to be real technical if
[53:59] you want to say something anything about
[54:01] the seals when you got born again I just
[54:03] read you what the Bible says grieve not
[54:05] the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're
[54:06] sealed until the day of your redemption
[54:09] well the seventh seal produced itself
[54:10] when Christ came in you even in your
[54:14] baby form but you didn't know how to
[54:15] handle it like we were talking this
[54:18] morning you know babies are wonderful
[54:20] but you know what if you take a baby and
[54:22] you send it right out there on that
[54:23] street it's gonna go right across that
[54:27] road even if it has to crawl but now at
[54:31] 10 years old hopefully he'll know that
[54:36] the cars are gonna kill him watch the
[54:38] same baby so God's the same way God's 1
[54:41] it's gotta guide us and that's what he's
[54:42] done through these seals and through
[54:44] your journey he's guided you so we're
[54:46] coming up to the end of the 7th seal the
[54:49] end of the seventh seal will be your
[54:50] body change everything runs out at the
[54:55] end of this seventh seal comes remember
[54:57] the seven seals in a three fold it
[54:59] opened in three folds everybody got that
[55:04] notice it's the end of the church age
[55:07] it's the end of the seven seals it's the
[55:10] end of the trumpets it's the end of the
[55:12] vials it even ends the ushering in of
[55:15] the Millennium that's on the seventh
[55:19] seal everybody got that say Amen alright
[55:22] so now let's get reading number five and
[55:25] in Sabina canyon he said this is the
[55:28] third pole and there's three great
[55:30] things that go with it one unfolding
[55:32] today or yesterday the other one
[55:33] unfolded today
[55:34] and there's one thing that I cannot
[55:36] interpret because in an unknown language
[55:38] now don't get caught up with that we'll
[55:40] break that down later on but I was
[55:43] standing right there and look straight
[55:44] at it and this is the third port of what
[55:46] brother Brown what is the third Pole
[55:47] it's the opening of the word you can
[55:50] call it everything in the world but it's
[55:51] the opening of the word all right the
[55:53] third pull is the opening of the word
[55:56] all right and this is the third pole
[55:58] coming up the Holy Spirit of God oh my
[56:00] that's the reason all heaven was silent
[56:03] oh my just shows us from God for it fits
[56:05] exactly in the promises of God from the
[56:08] end of the message you notice now for
[56:10] the end of time message remember I told
[56:14] you that's the name of this seal this is
[56:16] the end of time seal I'll tell you
[56:19] because that's what he said with him for
[56:21] the end of time message this seal after
[56:23] all he's revealed all the six seals but
[56:26] it don't say nothing about the seventh
[56:28] in other words put the board up here and
[56:31] draw me the seventh seal can't do it
[56:34] it's nothing all right and the end time
[56:38] seal when it starts will be absolutely a
[56:41] total secret according to the Bible all
[56:45] right what's it now what does he go to
[56:47] revelations 10 1 through 7 at the end of
[56:49] the seventh angel's message all the
[56:51] missions of God will be known we're at
[56:52] the end time the opening of the seventh
[56:55] seal now the Seventh Seal was spoke of
[56:58] since Genesis when God said let us make
[57:01] man in our image he started the process
[57:04] of the seventh seal because that was
[57:08] Christ amen now Christ didn't have a
[57:11] beginning but the Bible says the
[57:13] beginning of the creation of God so we
[57:15] got to see a beginning of our beginning
[57:18] for us a development of God I want I
[57:21] want to ask you something
[57:22] can you see more about God now than then
[57:25] then when you started your journey think
[57:27] about that now that's not you because
[57:31] Satan don't want nothing to do that he
[57:34] hates your progression he don't want us
[57:36] to grow up amen because see he met a
[57:39] growing God one time that defeated him
[57:42] by the word amen and that's what he's
[57:45] gonna meet again he's gonna meet a grown
[57:47] God not a baby God a grown-up God to
[57:51] defeat him by the word alright for the
[57:55] end of time seal when it starts will be
[57:57] absolutely a total secret according to
[58:00] the Bible and I believe that if it
[58:04] started then right here we're close to
[58:06] the ending of it what we say the ending
[58:08] are the culmination of what redemption
[58:13] for us now remember this is special it's
[58:18] for us
[58:19] this seventh seal in sting all things
[58:23] for me and you because listen when we go
[58:25] ahead when we step out on this earth and
[58:29] our body has been changed the dead
[58:31] Saints have already come here so death
[58:33] has been destroyed your body is going to
[58:36] be changed what's left you're finished
[58:40] it is the end of redemption for you amen
[58:46] that's why many people misinterpreted
[58:47] brother Branham when he was talking
[58:48] about Redemption being over now when the
[58:51] seventh seal produces itself Redemption
[58:53] will be over but now remember it won't
[58:55] be over for the world it won't be over
[58:58] for the 144,000 it won't be over for the
[59:01] foolish virgin a cup of water in my name
[59:06] Redemption will continue all but for you
[59:08] and me it will produce itself and
[59:10] that'll be the end of it like I said
[59:12] many times here we go again we don't
[59:15] have to stand any judgment
[59:18] we're already judged we're already
[59:22] judged so there's no judgment of that
[59:24] sure there's little things but I'm
[59:26] talking about whether you're gonna be go
[59:28] to heaven or go to hell that got settled
[59:31] when you received the baptism of the
[59:33] Holy Ghost cuz the baptism the Holy
[59:34] Ghost only went to hell one time and you
[59:37] went there with him God Himself went to
[59:40] hell and you went there with him she
[59:42] ain't gotta go no more alright so thank
[59:44] God for that so I see our judgment is
[59:47] over even right now your judgments over
[59:51] but we got to come to a place to where
[59:55] that what's inside of us is working its
[59:58] way out all right let's look at number
[1:00:00] six let's read this
[1:00:01] quit God 7 is God's perfect number
[1:00:05] that's what we were talking about last
[1:00:07] Sunday God's perfect number is 7 now
[1:00:10] remember what is 7 7 is 4 plus 3 4 is
[1:00:17] the number of redemption 3 is the number
[1:00:19] of perfection in 7 your complete all
[1:00:24] right God's perfect number 7 and we're
[1:00:27] read to you how many there was 800 and
[1:00:28] sometimes in the Bible it's on that
[1:00:30] piece of paper if you want one number 7
[1:00:32] and count now what does God do he starts
[1:00:34] with his number 7 that's God's number
[1:00:37] all right that's why the 7 still when it
[1:00:39] produces itself that puts God on the
[1:00:41] scene that's his number all right let's
[1:00:44] look at number 8 now the church has 7
[1:00:48] Church ages and that's a complete number
[1:00:49] of the church age that's all 7 7 is
[1:00:52] God's completed number everybody
[1:00:58] remember that 7 is God's completed
[1:01:00] number and I want you to understand
[1:01:04] something
[1:01:04] I know worse I know that we go into an 8
[1:01:08] we all know that but you got to go
[1:01:11] through 7 first you gotta go through 1 2
[1:01:15] remember he read on countdown he said
[1:01:17] man starts backwards and counts down 10
[1:01:19] 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 he said God doesn't
[1:01:22] countdown God counts up oh wait a minute
[1:01:25] God comes up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 he counts up
[1:01:29] not down like man does so remember that
[1:01:31] so now let's read first of all that
[1:01:33] solonian let's get into this just for a
[1:01:34] second everybody all right say ma'am
[1:01:42] first Thessalonians 4
[1:01:49] now when we start reading this I'm gonna
[1:01:53] give you the quotes and it took a
[1:01:56] prophet to tell us what this was all
[1:01:59] about it took a prophet to separate this
[1:02:04] and bring this because you just read it
[1:02:07] you know what denominations they read
[1:02:09] that and they go well one day one day
[1:02:12] this is just gonna happen Lord's going
[1:02:16] to sin with a shout you know like I told
[1:02:18] you that brother that denominational guy
[1:02:20] said I'll be glad when Jesus comes down
[1:02:21] splits the eastern sky and comes down
[1:02:24] through the through the clouds and I
[1:02:26] said well you don't miss the rapture cuz
[1:02:28] that's after the rapture takes place
[1:02:29] that's when the whole world ceasing we
[1:02:32] don't want that no I want the secret
[1:02:35] part I don't want to be standing here
[1:02:37] and watch him come down out of the
[1:02:39] clouds he's all ready to send it out of
[1:02:41] a cloud amen
[1:02:43] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:02:46] the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:02:48] remain who is that you remain unto the
[1:02:53] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:02:55] them which are asleep for the Lord
[1:02:59] Himself now that's Himself is personal
[1:03:02] he's not sending a second person he's
[1:03:07] not one
[1:03:07] he's sending himself the Lord himself
[1:03:11] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:03:13] with the voice of the Archangel with the
[1:03:16] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:03:18] shall rise first that's what I'm telling
[1:03:20] you don't look for a reservoir and all
[1:03:22] of for a rapture don't look for your
[1:03:24] body change we got to get two dead
[1:03:26] Saints out of the ground first
[1:03:28] remember God don't skip God goes that
[1:03:32] God goes you know why because we don't
[1:03:33] shouldn't skip we should go right in
[1:03:35] continuity right here the dead in Christ
[1:03:37] shall rise first then we which are alive
[1:03:41] and remain shall be caught up together
[1:03:44] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[1:03:46] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[1:03:47] the Lord now that's the end that's the
[1:03:50] seventh seal that's the end of our
[1:03:52] journey when we go over into another
[1:03:55] dimension we've ended our earthly time
[1:03:58] as far as human time
[1:04:02] right but now I want to ask you a
[1:04:05] question that's we which are alive and
[1:04:09] remain shall be caught up or changed but
[1:04:13] now the dead in Christ they're not
[1:04:15] finished cuz they got to come back here
[1:04:16] and get their earthly bodies so their
[1:04:19] journey continues
[1:04:20] remember the brother branham I'll read
[1:04:23] you the quote later on the 7th seal
[1:04:24] brings him back to earth you say well
[1:04:28] that's that one person Jesus don't come
[1:04:30] back to earth people until the Millenium
[1:04:33] so who is Christ Christ is those people
[1:04:36] that are in that sixth dimension that's
[1:04:38] what we're missing
[1:04:41] those people are Christ that's in that
[1:04:46] sixth dimension right now and they're
[1:04:48] gonna come into this dimension that's
[1:04:51] bringing crops back to earth because
[1:04:54] who's Christ Christ is what in you the
[1:04:56] hope of glory
[1:04:57] that's his bride so the Lord himself
[1:04:59] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:05:01] and that's the first thing we got to
[1:05:02] look at hey alright well let's say man
[1:05:05] cuz this is how we get now remember
[1:05:08] God's been here the whole time
[1:05:11] he has just been bound up with so much
[1:05:14] tradition and so much this and that and
[1:05:17] I didn't do this and I don't do that and
[1:05:19] this one he's been here the whole time
[1:05:22] when God came down here on the day of
[1:05:24] Pentecost he never left he stayed right
[1:05:26] here alright now let's go to the rapture
[1:05:29] message now I want you to notice a great
[1:05:33] thing take place and I don't miss it the
[1:05:36] word says here in 2nd Thessalonians that
[1:05:38] there's three things notice from the
[1:05:40] 13th to the 16th verse there is three
[1:05:43] things that happens before the Lord
[1:05:45] Himself appears now remember three is
[1:05:47] the number of perfection brother Branham
[1:05:50] saw the seventh still open in a
[1:05:51] three-fold manner thereby alright the
[1:05:53] man okay
[1:05:56] so there's three things happens before
[1:05:58] the Lord Himself appears now he's not
[1:06:04] gonna appear in a physical form we got
[1:06:07] to get away from that he's appearing in
[1:06:12] you
[1:06:14] you're the you're the second coming
[1:06:19] crunch don't come back at the second
[1:06:22] coming we go meet him in the air Christ
[1:06:26] only comes into millennium when wind 144
[1:06:29] thousands already been sealed the world
[1:06:32] already been through arming go out wait
[1:06:34] a minute we've already been changed the
[1:06:36] earth goes through two witnesses been
[1:06:38] our 144,000 there's a Battle of
[1:06:41] Armageddon and then it wipes us off for
[1:06:44] the Millennium and that's when Christ
[1:06:45] comes down with us now that's when you
[1:06:47] see him in a physical form you will not
[1:06:51] see him before then in a physical
[1:06:54] one-man form so it has to be bride form
[1:06:58] from today even if you just take it from
[1:07:01] today it's got to be bride form from
[1:07:02] today until that day that he comes into
[1:07:05] millennium he's always got to be showing
[1:07:08] him bride form to the Gentiles no not to
[1:07:12] the Jews but remember he's not going
[1:07:14] personally the Jews he sent the two
[1:07:15] prophets a man he's sending two prophets
[1:07:18] he's not coming himself he's sending two
[1:07:20] prophets which is what the Word made
[1:07:23] flesh in two men which is Christ read
[1:07:30] zechariah they preach Christ so real
[1:07:33] till they don't say how did you prop two
[1:07:36] prophets get here the Bible says they
[1:07:39] they say where did you get those scars
[1:07:42] he says in the house of my friends now
[1:07:45] that's got to be two witnesses talking
[1:07:47] to them and preaching them Christ Oh
[1:07:49] real till they see what they've done
[1:07:52] amen
[1:07:53] they said they see what they've done
[1:07:55] through them two witnesses and that's
[1:07:58] the same way with you and I this world
[1:08:01] is only gonna see Christ through me and
[1:08:02] you look quickly now we can close we can
[1:08:08] quickly now we can close the first thing
[1:08:10] happens a shout a voice of trumpet let's
[1:08:13] read it now keep going up for the Lord
[1:08:15] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:08:17] shout and with the voice of the
[1:08:19] Archangel and the Trump of God three
[1:08:22] things happen a voice a shout a voice a
[1:08:25] trumpet
[1:08:26] to happen before Jesus appears now a
[1:08:30] shout Jesus does all three of them when
[1:08:33] he's descending so when he's descending
[1:08:38] these three things are gonna happen a
[1:08:39] shout what is the shout it's the message
[1:08:43] going forth now not the message in books
[1:08:47] our quote books the message in you if
[1:08:52] the message going forth first the Living
[1:08:55] bread of life bringing forth the bride
[1:09:03] bringing forth the bride talking up to
[1:09:08] you what about that let's keep reading
[1:09:13] the rapture number 10 this is goes on
[1:09:15] down a little bit further I cut a few of
[1:09:17] the paragraphs out the first thing comes
[1:09:19] when he starts descending from heaven
[1:09:21] there's a shout now we got to understand
[1:09:28] some things and look at these remember I
[1:09:32] talked about the onion peel onions got a
[1:09:34] real thin layer and you just keep
[1:09:36] peeling it off and you just keep peeling
[1:09:37] it off and peeling it off
[1:09:39] same way with the Word of God because
[1:09:41] remember this is this is saying if you
[1:09:44] read it like brother Brown said it that
[1:09:46] means that God didn't come into that pen
[1:09:48] or the Holy Ghost didn't come on the day
[1:09:50] of Pentecost it that we've had nothing
[1:09:52] from now that's not true we've had the
[1:09:55] Holy Ghost in its part in its part but
[1:09:59] this is coming to the seventh seal the
[1:10:01] completed part all right when he starts
[1:10:04] descending from heaven he's talking
[1:10:07] about this church age he's talking about
[1:10:09] this age we're living in now alright
[1:10:12] what is it a message to get the people
[1:10:15] together now I don't know if that's
[1:10:17] happened or not
[1:10:25] let's read it real slow it's a message
[1:10:31] to get the people together has he got us
[1:10:40] all together yet hmm we can't get 10
[1:10:48] preachers to step in the same building
[1:10:50] together without having an argument but
[1:10:54] you know what like brother Dale said you
[1:10:57] know the the disciples walked with him
[1:11:00] for three and a half years saw him go
[1:11:05] through all that resurrect and they
[1:11:08] still wondered what he was doing are you
[1:11:11] going to restore Israel are you gonna do
[1:11:12] this yeah but we should be way past that
[1:11:17] to get the people together a message
[1:11:21] come forth first that message we've had
[1:11:24] now now now now lamp trimming time the
[1:11:31] message has come forth first stop right
[1:11:33] here
[1:11:34] now now lamp trimming time rise and trim

[1:11:56] them found out they didn't have oil in
[1:11:58] their lamps see but its lamp trimming
[1:12:00] time now he goes back to the five wise
[1:12:02] and the five foolish virgins the but the
[1:12:05] five foolish virgins they were virgins
[1:12:07] and they were wise some of them but then
[1:12:13] you had five foolish virgins
[1:12:15] the wise virgins trimmed their lamp and
[1:12:17] went up what they got called away behold
[1:12:20] the bridegroom cometh in other words the
[1:12:22] shout what's the shout coming from the
[1:12:24] shout is not coming from William Miriam

[1:12:48] they say in that scripture what did they
[1:12:49] tell them we've only got enough for
[1:12:52] ourselves
[1:12:53] you want me to interpret that for you
[1:12:55] let me interpret that whole scenario for
[1:12:58] you the five wise virgins came to church
[1:13:06] the five foolish didn't they were
[1:13:11] foolish the five wise virgins studied
[1:13:15] their Bible the five wives of virgins
[1:13:17] did what the Bible said the five foolish
[1:13:21] virgins did some of what the Bible said
[1:13:26] they buy all right and hurt your
[1:13:29] feelings dinner if you don't come to
[1:13:31] church I guess I did but it wasn't me
[1:13:38] listen it's time to either be part time
[1:13:40] if you don't be a part-time Christian
[1:13:42] you need to go to Baptist Church

[1:13:50] Baptist Church get in or get out mo
[1:13:58] football coach said lead follow or get
[1:14:00] out of the way so that's exactly what we
[1:14:03] need to be now because look brother
[1:14:04] branham didn't say now it's time maybe
[1:14:07] that we we might need to trim our lamps
[1:14:11] maybe not no he said now lamp trimming
[1:14:15] time now either get in or get out rise
[1:14:20] and trim your lamps where were they
[1:14:23] they may have been asleep rise and trim
[1:14:27] your lamps and they did because remember
[1:14:30] they came in the seventh watch which was
[1:14:31] later on it was at the end time
[1:14:33] all right there bouquet with that now
[1:14:36] that word shout we're gonna go right
[1:14:40] here and then we'll be done mm-hmm
[1:14:42] because we're gonna get into something
[1:14:42] else I want to stop here we're getting
[1:14:44] something else two Sundays from now not
[1:14:46] this coming Sunday y'all pray for you
[1:14:48] brothers it's going to be
[1:14:49] wasn't y'all this weekend the word shout
[1:14:52] is an order a command some people take
[1:14:59] this message as a suggestion or even the
[1:15:03] Bible that's what said about the
[1:15:04] commandments it's not Ten Commandments
[1:15:05] anymore 10 suggestions I mean really an
[1:15:10] order a command specifically a
[1:15:15] stimulating cry specifically a
[1:15:19] stimulating cry either that by which
[1:15:23] animals aroused and urged by man as
[1:15:25] horses by charioteers hounds by hunters
[1:15:28] etc or that by which a signal is given
[1:15:31] to men what to start a race a lot of
[1:15:38] times you have somebody say go or start
[1:15:40] or blow a whistle or blow a trumpet to
[1:15:44] rowers but at watch will they loud
[1:15:46] summons a trumpet call to soldiers by a
[1:15:50] commander that's what I want to say an
[1:15:52] order or a command that shout came from
[1:15:56] God to wake up the bride and then we're
[1:16:03] to trim our Lambs
[1:16:05] it's lamp trimming time the bride has
[1:16:08] made herself ready no the wife has made
[1:16:11] herself ready not the bride we're not
[1:16:14] bright anymore oh yeah we say that
[1:16:17] because it's terminology but June's my
[1:16:19] wife there's a lot of things in 40 years
[1:16:22] that we've learned about each other that
[1:16:23] she's not my bride anymore she's my wife
[1:16:26] she's me in that same way with God
[1:16:28] there's not a time where brother Brown
[1:16:30] said yeah I'll call you bride but that's
[1:16:32] been 50 something years ago we should be
[1:16:34] off to the wife now now watch this real
[1:16:41] quick let's look at this let's go to
[1:16:43] Joshua everybody knows the scenario but
[1:16:47] watch what happened
[1:16:49] remember the Seventh Seal There was
[1:16:51] silence in heaven from the space about
[1:16:53] half an hour and it came to pass when
[1:16:55] Joshua spoken to the people that the
[1:16:56] seven priests bared the seven trumpets a
[1:16:58] ram horn
[1:16:59] passed on before the Lord remember the
[1:17:01] around Jericho listen and blue with the
[1:17:04] trumpets and the Ark of the Covenant of
[1:17:07] the Lord followed them and the armed men
[1:17:10] went before the priests that blue with
[1:17:12] the trumpets and the rear awards which
[1:17:14] is the rear of the army came after the
[1:17:17] art the priests going on and blowing
[1:17:19] with the trumpet and Joshua had
[1:17:22] commanded the people saying ye shall not
[1:17:26] shout or make any noise with your voice
[1:17:37] but look all that but now what am I
[1:17:40] saying everything is going on though
[1:17:42] he's setting up God setting up to
[1:17:44] destroy Jericho gods give Joshua all
[1:17:47] this command to put these people in
[1:17:48] certain places but Joshua says you shall
[1:17:52] not shout nor make any noise with your
[1:17:56] voice
[1:17:57] neither shall any word proceed out of
[1:18:01] your mouth until the day I bid you shout
[1:18:06] that's our problem
[1:18:08] we've been shouting presumptuously
[1:18:09] because of all these false doctrines
[1:18:11] somebody will have a shout and people
[1:18:13] will follow it let's just really dig
[1:18:15] down into this thing people will follow
[1:18:18] it Joshua said don't shout don't make no
[1:18:25] noise neither shall any word proceed out
[1:18:28] of your mouth until the day I bid now
[1:18:31] what is it Joshua what is Joshua on top
[1:18:34] of the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost in
[1:18:37] you until the day I bid you shout then
[1:18:43] show you show you know what was so
[1:18:46] miraculous here's Jericho this is the
[1:18:49] whole scene then we'll close here's
[1:18:50] Jericho Jericho had walls so big till
[1:18:54] chariots could run chases run run races
[1:18:56] around the top of it it was so big there
[1:18:58] was like a million or so people inside
[1:19:00] that City they had shut the doors up no
[1:19:05] doubt they had a big army had to of
[1:19:07] having a city that big to protect them
[1:19:09] with but they all shut their self up in
[1:19:11] the city and now you got now you
[1:19:14] got the children of Israel and Joshua
[1:19:18] says don't say a word don't even talk
[1:19:24] until I tell you to so remember the
[1:19:27] scenario then they walked one time
[1:19:30] around for six days then on the seventh
[1:19:33] day they went seven times but now
[1:19:36] remember there was silence listen I get
[1:19:43] unnerved at silence don't you and when
[1:19:49] these little things going on you know
[1:19:50] it's so heat coming but when it's dead
[1:19:52] silence what do you think about that
[1:19:57] whole big say you take now tape Atlanta
[1:20:00] and circle it in a big old big old wall
[1:20:04] all the way around the perimeter of
[1:20:06] Atlanta that wouldn't be too bad around
[1:20:08] the perimeter of Atlanta and then here
[1:20:12] you got this little army of several
[1:20:14] thousand people they got no guns or
[1:20:20] anything all they gots them and a couple
[1:20:22] of trumpets and an art they carry this
[1:20:24] funny thing around you see what I'm
[1:20:26] saying if you were looking out from
[1:20:27] Jericho and you're looking out from
[1:20:29] Jericho you would think man all the man
[1:20:31] of war they're getting you can hear the
[1:20:32] you can hear the spears coming together
[1:20:34] and you can hear them you know they're
[1:20:36] getting their gear on and they're
[1:20:37] putting everything together maybe
[1:20:38] somebody pops off a few shots just to
[1:20:40] make sure they're practice and make sure
[1:20:41] the gun goes off dead silence dead
[1:20:46] silence
[1:20:48] for a week they go around the city seven
[1:20:54] times six times and then on the seventh
[1:20:58] day they go seven times they don't say a
[1:21:03] word
[1:21:04] there's nothing going on but there's
[1:21:07] something fixing to happen that's what
[1:21:10] it is will mean you were to the place
[1:21:11] right now we're getting ready to go
[1:21:14] around Jericho because the last wall we
[1:21:17] have is that wall that we have a problem
[1:21:21] with and that's the body change but what
[1:21:25] did God say God said Joshua you tell
[1:21:27] them
[1:21:28] go around and Joshua said now when I
[1:21:29] tell you to shout you shall they go
[1:21:34] around that last day you see the people
[1:21:36] in Jericho they're just watching them
[1:21:38] nothing not saying a word zero going on
[1:21:43] and all of a sudden Joshua says shout
[1:21:49] and they bring this great shout out of
[1:21:53] their out of their lungs because you
[1:21:55] know what they've been seven days ain't
[1:21:57] said nothing specially the sisters they
[1:22:01] were busting that's the Saints bent no
[1:22:04] but left oh that's true with everybody
[1:22:07] not say something for seven days try but
[1:22:12] you see this great city and that's what
[1:22:14] we're looking at now we're looking at
[1:22:15] the walls of Jericho because there's no
[1:22:18] way we can knock him down by our own
[1:22:19] himself but they just walked around it
[1:22:22] seven times and just stopped and when
[1:22:25] Joshua said shout they shouted the walls
[1:22:29] didn't collapse they disappeared they
[1:22:34] went straight down into the ground cuz
[1:22:35] there's no way they could have crawled
[1:22:36] over all that rubble the the ground
[1:22:38] opened up and the thing went straight
[1:22:39] down in the ground
[1:22:40] that was a burial and you know what
[1:22:44] happened and if you read the rest of
[1:22:46] this story God put a curse on that city
[1:22:49] he said cursed be the man that ever
[1:22:51] makes this city again I tell you cursed
[1:22:55] be the devil that ever gonna come up
[1:22:57] against us again he will not win this
[1:23:00] time he will not win the next time and
[1:23:02] he will not win any other time so the
[1:23:05] walls of Jericho are getting ready to
[1:23:07] come down
[1:23:07] but what by a silent group of people but
[1:23:13] remember when they shouted they knew
[1:23:17] what they were shouting about Joshua
[1:23:20] told them the seventh time you stop turn
[1:23:24] toward the wall and shout they got their
[1:23:27] instructions before they started you and
[1:23:29] I have got our instructions before we
[1:23:32] started in this journey we're getting
[1:23:34] our instructions every Sunday every
[1:23:35] Wednesday every time you might play you
[1:23:38] get your instruction because that great
[1:23:40] big wall of Jericho
[1:23:41] you know what we got to get through it
[1:23:43] you we got to get through it we can't go
[1:23:48] around why don't you why don't you think
[1:23:49] the children of Israel didn't just go
[1:23:51] around Jericho hey it was plenty of land
[1:23:54] thousands of acres on this side of
[1:23:56] Jordan and thousand acres on this side
[1:23:58] of Jordan they could have just walked
[1:24:00] somewhere else brother Danny they could
[1:24:01] have went and just aborted Jericho no
[1:24:04] God didn't want them to avoid Jericho
[1:24:05] God wanted to show the people in Jericho
[1:24:10] and the people that were his people that
[1:24:12] he was in command but God didn't come
[1:24:18] down in a whirlwind God didn't come down
[1:24:20] in the cloud he came in a group of
[1:24:26] people he ain't coming all the
[1:24:29] clattering and all they didn't have the
[1:24:30] biggest fears and they didn't have the

[1:24:57] talking you can talk to them for hours
[1:24:59] and they'll not know what you're talking
[1:25:01] about and sadly to say half the people
[1:25:04] in this message you start talking to
[1:25:06] them about certain things and they'll
[1:25:07] look at you with that far-off gaze like
[1:25:10] I'm not supposed to know this and
[1:25:17] they'll swear that we're living under an
[1:25:20] open book I mean that's what life is an
[1:25:24] open book we're living under the age of
[1:25:27] the open book hallelujah how about to
[1:25:29] see if no I don't think we'll worry with
[1:25:30] Emily what about Daniel sander nah
[1:25:33] that's too tough and that's too tough no
[1:25:34] if we're living under open book if that
[1:25:37] books open now God ought to be able to
[1:25:40] speak to you through that that's the
[1:25:44] shout the shout is you and I there's a
[1:25:48] shout of the King in the camp the Bible
[1:25:50] says you and I are not recipients of
[1:25:55] the shout we are the shout sure we had
[1:26:00] to hear all these things sure we had to
[1:26:01] have a Joshua on the scene we had to
[1:26:03] have the Holy Ghost to instruct us on
[1:26:05] what to do but on the very day that they
[1:26:07] took the walls of Jericho down Joshua
[1:26:10] blew it and set up on a hill somewhere
[1:26:13] just wasn't with him he was looking far
[1:26:16] off I think the Bible says he's up here
[1:26:18] watching his people that's what God is
[1:26:20] doing he's watching his people and
[1:26:22] they're doing what he tells them to do
[1:26:25] and if they do it the right way the
[1:26:27] walls of Jericho will absolutely
[1:26:29] disappear anything you need it will
[1:26:32] disappear let's sing a song god bless
