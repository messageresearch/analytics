[24:19] uh you know god i'd rather amen
[24:23] well god bless you all
[24:25] um you want to know how i broke my arm
[24:29] eve fell and i broke my arm
[24:33] but i'm grateful to be a christian today
[24:37] this message has been very special to me
[24:38] i don't really have anything planned to
[24:40] say it's not my time to speak anyway but
[24:43] i want to be found faithful during hard
[24:45] times and
[24:46] if you've ever prayed for the kishan
[24:48] family now be a good time
[24:50] i guess i get to be like job just a
[24:52] little bit
[24:53] and uh
[24:54] i'm proud because i already know the
[24:56] answer
[24:57] i will never give up my faith
[25:00] the harder things get the harder i'm
[25:02] going to pull myself to calvary's hill
[25:05] amen
[25:06] i don't care what happens
[25:08] i don't care if i fail i'm still going
[25:10] to calvary's hill
[25:12] and i'm grateful i found in life too you
[25:14] can't get along without another part of
[25:16] your body
[25:18] my life is messed up right now
[25:20] every time i go to do something my right
[25:22] hand wants to work but it's broke
[25:24] amen and i think of the body of jesus
[25:26] christ we need one another
[25:28] we need one another i look i look out
[25:30] here and through the years you've given
[25:32] me your friendship i appreciate that so
[25:33] many of you have helped me i appreciate
[25:35] that now i need your help i need your
[25:37] prayers amen amen and uh i'm grateful
[25:40] the bone will heal why because the word
[25:42] promises the bone will heal amen the
[25:45] body of christ is going through lots of
[25:46] struggles and lots of trials and i think
[25:48] why would my arm break when nothing
[25:50] happens by accident and i think of the
[25:52] story of gideon when he had all those
[25:53] soldiers to fight the enemy with lets me
[25:57] always lean into the arm of the flesh to
[25:58] fight my battles so he took care of that
[26:02] and i found out that i can do more with
[26:04] the broken arm than i could do with true
[26:05] strong arms
[26:07] if that would be the lord's will and
[26:08] that's the lord's will
[26:11] we've come a long way in this message
[26:13] and we've got a little ways to go it's
[26:14] no time to quit
[26:16] it's time to you know i think if god has
[26:18] honored me to take the place of job and
[26:21] if there was a conversation in heaven
[26:23] and he says look at the crescend family
[26:25] the good lord would say look at how they
[26:26] please you look at how they love you and
[26:29] satan says yeah but i can turn that
[26:30] around i'll start messing with their
[26:32] health i'll start messing with their
[26:33] kids i'll start messing with uh with uh
[26:36] i'll create misunderstandings and the
[26:38] lord said
[26:40] do it
[26:41] and if that be the lord's will and if
[26:43] that is what happening let me tell you
[26:46] right now i will never leave this
[26:49] message i will never stop serving god
[26:52] if i'm dying don't be crying for me put
[26:54] my hand in the air so i can worship the
[26:56] lord i have never been more convinced of
[26:59] this gospel i have never been more
[27:02] convinced of healing deliverance
[27:04] and i need your prayers and i need your
[27:06] support
[27:07] and i've got it and i know i do and
[27:09] that's love feels really good
[27:11] amen this message will never fail
[27:13] because love lifts it up
[27:15] i remember praying and praying brother
[27:18] samuel it just didn't look good for
[27:19] brother youssef did it
[27:21] and i remember we kept praying and kept
[27:22] praying and kept praying and something
[27:24] started knocking on the door of heaven
[27:26] and you know what today i saw a picture
[27:28] of on on the internet he's over by the
[27:30] beach with his with his wife
[27:32] and he's walking with his two boys and
[27:34] he's a free man why because that's the
[27:36] god we serve
[27:38] but you know we have to have patience
[27:40] sometimes
[27:41] and if god you know we tend to fight our
[27:43] battles with the arm of flesh and he
[27:45] doesn't want us to
[27:46] we tend to be
[27:48] filled with great faith when we see
[27:50] things going well or when we hear things
[27:52] going well
[27:53] so god took my sight and showed me
[27:56] things that i need to see in the
[27:58] spiritual
[27:59] we need to fight by what we believe
[28:02] because if we look at the political
[28:03] realm if we look at the
[28:05] educational realm if we look at the
[28:07] moralistic realm or the religious realm
[28:09] you won't be happy
[28:10] if you look at your financial situation
[28:12] you won't be happy
[28:14] but if you continue to look to what you
[28:16] believe something he can't touch and
[28:18] i've learned one last thing i'm sorry
[28:20] i'm talking too much but in dealing with
[28:22] the devils
[28:23] you better just tell them the truth
[28:25] because they know if you're bluffing
[28:27] you make sure look him right in the eye
[28:28] and say you know what devil the word of
[28:30] god is stronger than you isn't it it'll
[28:32] have to say yes
[28:34] jesus promised healing for his children
[28:36] didn't he he'll have to say yes but
[28:38] don't go saying you're going to get a
[28:40] milky way candy bars from mars because
[28:42] he don't have to say yes
[28:45] stick with what's the truth and they
[28:46] have to listen amen learn to fight the
[28:49] way the bible says to fight these things
[28:51] and god help us to do it because if you
[28:53] don't fight it right
[28:55] he will bring troubles to you
[28:57] he'll bring trials to you and someone
[28:59] says you can be honored because trials
[29:00] are upon you that means god can trust
[29:03] you so i want to be trustworthy i will
[29:06] serve god
[29:07] if i come back next time and both arms
[29:09] are broke and both legs are broke you'll
[29:11] see me in a wheelchair up here telling
[29:13] you i trust god
[29:15] because i will
[29:16] you know he said he'll never leave me
[29:17] nor forsake me and if he's inside of me
[29:20] guess what i won't do with him
[29:22] i will never leave him nor for save him
[29:24] amen how could i leave someone who saved
[29:26] me how could i turn down this great
[29:28] message this great christian life if he
[29:30] saved me we need to just know what we
[29:33] have
[29:34] know what you have and stand on what you
[29:36] have anything extra unique god will
[29:38] bring to pass but i love him with all my
[29:41] heart and i can't explain why part of my
[29:43] life is just going through torture in
[29:45] the other part of my life i never felt
[29:47] such peace
[29:48] and i don't understand all that's going
[29:50] on but i know one who does so be praying
[29:54] for the christian family i guess uh some
[29:56] grew up on me and they got jobs and
[29:59] others got things i don't know how that
[30:01] happened i brought a bunch of nice young
[30:03] kids and now they turn into young ladies
[30:05] and gentlemen
[30:09] my oh my look at christopher they're in
[30:11] your
[30:12] crutches and i feel right at home here
[30:13] up there
[30:16] but uh come on up anna and the boys i
[30:18] guess we got a song and sarah said will
[30:20] you sing with us daddy i said i sure
[30:22] will honey i love singing to the lord
[30:25] amen
[30:26] she said i'll get your words
[31:00] last one

[31:18] little david oh so small
[31:23] the giant oh so tall
[31:28] the odds were just too high for little
[31:32] david
[31:36] so we shook off all of his foes
[31:40] but with the power of god he was close
[31:44] the battle's not blind i give it to you

[32:36] before the giant he stood that day
[32:41] it seemed
[32:42] to be the end for little david
[32:49] but like the lion and the bear that he
[32:52] flew
[32:53] that old giant would come down too

[38:17] one
[38:18] willing to
[38:21] be
[38:25] the supreme
[38:28] sacrifice

[40:12] oh
[40:15] had it not been
[40:17] for a place called mount calvary
[40:37] had it not been
[40:39] for a man
[40:42] called jesus

[1:21:26] to spirit amen
[1:21:27] if we just bow our hearts before we
[1:21:29] enter the word
[1:21:30] heavenly father
[1:21:32] lord it's such a wonderful day to serve
[1:21:35] you and a beautiful time and season
[1:21:37] father and lord as your people have
[1:21:40] gathered in this place this morning lord
[1:21:42] and they've begun to worship you and
[1:21:44] love you and lord we feel the the
[1:21:47] atmosphere lord the spirit of grace
[1:21:50] that's moved among us and lord we're
[1:21:52] just asking you now that you would help
[1:21:54] the speaker and lord help us to say
[1:21:56] something lord that would would prick
[1:21:58] the hearts of the believers lord that
[1:22:00] would lord help us to take another step
[1:22:03] lord encourage our faith strengthen us
[1:22:05] lord as we love you and want to serve
[1:22:07] you with all of our minds father we ask
[1:22:10] you to bless these people father that
[1:22:11] have come now help us father in jesus
[1:22:14] name we pray
[1:22:15] amen
[1:22:17] and amen uh we're going to look into the
[1:22:21] bible in the book of luke
[1:22:23] in the book of luke the fourth chapter
[1:22:26] and we want to look in the
[1:22:29] in the 17th verse
[1:22:32] and i know that i'm not going to be able
[1:22:34] to say a lot about this but i won't just
[1:22:36] take a few minutes and
[1:22:38] the lord would use something here in our
[1:22:40] hearts
[1:22:42] and that was delivered unto him
[1:22:45] the book of the prophet isaias
[1:22:48] and when he had opened the book and he
[1:22:49] found written
[1:22:51] found the place where it was written
[1:22:53] and book of isaias of course is the book
[1:22:55] of isaiah and this was handed to jesus
[1:22:58] when he was in the synagogue on the
[1:22:59] sabbath day
[1:23:00] and that book of isaiah having 66
[1:23:03] chapters in it but said it was a
[1:23:06] conclusive bible in itself that he wrote
[1:23:09] of everything from the beginning plum to
[1:23:10] the end and so jesus had in his hand the
[1:23:14] compiled bible
[1:23:15] that was from eden all the way over and
[1:23:18] he chose the place
[1:23:20] that was written in the book
[1:23:22] for the morning that he was ministering
[1:23:24] to the people that he was speaking to
[1:23:27] so he found the place where it was
[1:23:29] written and then the spirit of the lord
[1:23:31] is upon me he began to read isaiah 61
[1:23:33] and verse 1. the spirit of the lord is
[1:23:35] upon me because he hath appointed me to
[1:23:37] preach the gospel to the poor he has
[1:23:40] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:23:42] preach deliverance to the captives
[1:23:44] recovering of the sight to the blind and
[1:23:45] said it liberty them that are bruised
[1:23:48] and to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:23:50] lord
[1:23:51] and then he closed the book and he gave
[1:23:53] it again to the minister and sat down
[1:23:55] and the eyes of them that were in the
[1:23:56] synagogue were fastened on him now you
[1:23:59] that know isaiah 61 knows that he didn't
[1:24:01] finish that's that's that sentence there
[1:24:04] he left a portion because it wasn't for
[1:24:06] that morning and the following statement
[1:24:08] he was going to say and this day this
[1:24:11] scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[1:24:14] amen we just asked the lord to bless the
[1:24:16] word as you may be seated this evening i
[1:24:18] want to talk to you just for a few
[1:24:20] minutes on a reflection
[1:24:23] of the seasons and you know i've been
[1:24:26] studying on the seasons the last little
[1:24:27] bit the lord been dealing with my heart
[1:24:29] and and you know i i've been looking at
[1:24:32] something that that i think that is is
[1:24:34] the time and the the season that we're
[1:24:36] living in and you all know what brother
[1:24:38] branham had to say about it that of
[1:24:40] course it's the greatest seasons that
[1:24:41] could be ever lived in is a season that
[1:24:44] we're living in and the bible uh
[1:24:46] predicts about it i i look at how the
[1:24:49] bible speaks of the coming of the lord
[1:24:51] and brother brahm said you know he said
[1:24:52] our lord jesus when he was dying he said
[1:24:55] he had more to say about his second
[1:24:57] coming than he even did about his death
[1:24:59] burial and resurrection he said because
[1:25:01] it was something that was of great
[1:25:03] importance
[1:25:04] amen and we know that we're living in
[1:25:07] the season of that coming and and
[1:25:10] looking at the time and the seasons i
[1:25:12] believe that that god by a divine
[1:25:15] intelligence anoints people to live in
[1:25:18] the season that they're put in i i don't
[1:25:21] i don't believe that we can just say
[1:25:22] it's some kind of an accident that we're
[1:25:24] all sitting here today and and we've all
[1:25:26] gathered in this building at this
[1:25:28] particular time and out of 6 000 years
[1:25:31] we've got breath to breathe right now
[1:25:33] that we have a body to to reflect in
[1:25:35] this time and and having done that we
[1:25:38] know that god himself picks the and
[1:25:40] chooses the ages where he reveals his
[1:25:43] word and it's up to him to make that
[1:25:46] season live and it lives by the word
[1:25:48] that's revealed in its time the prophet
[1:25:50] of god told us he said you see the
[1:25:52] catholics didn't know nothing about
[1:25:54] martin luther's message and john wesley
[1:25:56] know nothing about luther's message and
[1:25:58] the pentecostals he said they know
[1:26:00] nothing about this message he said see
[1:26:03] he's going to reveal it in its season
[1:26:05] because it's a seed and it grows and
[1:26:08] matures he reveals himself
[1:26:10] in one place brother branham says see
[1:26:12] god reveals this word in the season and
[1:26:14] to whom he chooses to reveal it to isn't
[1:26:17] that something that god holds the
[1:26:19] sovereignty of this he's going to reveal
[1:26:21] a word in a season but then he even
[1:26:24] chooses who he's going to reveal it to
[1:26:26] so hey man so you know you look at how
[1:26:29] that people set up all these
[1:26:31] organizations and all these great plans
[1:26:33] and this is going to be the way god's
[1:26:34] going to do something but god is always
[1:26:37] bypassing what man plans to do and he
[1:26:40] comes and gives it to a person or a
[1:26:43] people that he chooses to give it to god
[1:26:45] don't have to use the programs man sets
[1:26:48] up god's got his own program
[1:26:50] and he's by divine intelligence lays
[1:26:52] that program out and puts a people in it
[1:26:55] that he can choose it himself you know
[1:26:57] to think that god chooses to who he will
[1:26:59] reveal it and he done this choosing
[1:27:02] before the world even began all of his
[1:27:04] doings were foreknown by him but they're
[1:27:07] hidden from the man see god reveals them
[1:27:10] as he will in a chosen season to a
[1:27:12] chosen person and he never did choose a
[1:27:15] party or sect he chooses a person and
[1:27:18] that's how that god does it god chooses
[1:27:21] now if there's going to be a choose and
[1:27:22] it's it's hidden from man but it's
[1:27:25] something known to god so therefore god
[1:27:27] can display it in all of the attributes
[1:27:30] of the of the world and of the other
[1:27:32] plants and in the word he could write it
[1:27:34] all there and it's all hidden from man
[1:27:37] but for known of god so he can lay it
[1:27:39] out just as it would do it but it's
[1:27:41] still hid from man of what he's going to
[1:27:43] do it's a divine intelligence it's a
[1:27:46] wisdom that's higher than man and and
[1:27:49] when you look and see how that god's
[1:27:51] intelligence that that intelligence is
[1:27:53] what planted a cactus out in the deserts
[1:27:56] it's the same intelligence that put a
[1:27:58] pine tree on the mountain when you look
[1:28:00] at that intelligence that intelligence
[1:28:03] is what we're looking at today when the
[1:28:05] prophet of god said that divine
[1:28:07] intelligence put those things where they
[1:28:09] are because he knows what it takes for
[1:28:12] that to live in a certain atmosphere or
[1:28:15] a certain time when you when you think
[1:28:17] of the the atmospheres that it takes for
[1:28:20] a cactus it's a lot different than that
[1:28:22] what takes for a pine tree but the god
[1:28:24] of heaven knows where the atmosphere is
[1:28:27] and what it is this this is the same god
[1:28:29] now amen that created the world and
[1:28:32] before he could ever bring adam and eve
[1:28:34] god had to create an atmosphere to put
[1:28:37] them in so
[1:28:38] for out of six days god was going to
[1:28:40] create he spent five of them days
[1:28:42] creating an atmosphere just to bring his
[1:28:45] children into and when you look and see
[1:28:48] that for six thousand years man has been
[1:28:50] on the face of the earth but god has
[1:28:53] been hiding something from man amen
[1:28:55] since the beginning something that's
[1:28:57] been hid and the prophet of god said the
[1:28:59] reason is there wasn't a people who
[1:29:02] could comprehend what god was wanting
[1:29:04] them to see so there was something god's
[1:29:06] been waiting on there is something he's
[1:29:09] been waiting on what he's been waiting
[1:29:11] on it's a bride that could understand
[1:29:14] the revelation of of the manifestation
[1:29:16] of who that he is when you think of this
[1:29:20] today that divine intelligence amen to
[1:29:22] build an atmosphere when you look at the
[1:29:25] atmospheres that god has built the
[1:29:26] atmosphere for the last 2000 years
[1:29:29] leading up to something leading up to a
[1:29:32] great something knowing this that man
[1:29:35] does not live in the top of the mountain
[1:29:38] he knows that the lion doesn't live in
[1:29:40] the top of the mountain he knows that
[1:29:43] it's only the eagle that lives in the
[1:29:45] top of the mountain this bright church
[1:29:48] was not anointed to live in the faith
[1:29:50] age she was not anointed to live in a
[1:29:53] knowledge age she wasn't anointed to
[1:29:55] live a man in an age of virtue or
[1:29:57] knowledge of patience or godliness but
[1:30:00] she went plumbed to the top where the
[1:30:02] cat stone is coming down because the
[1:30:05] anointing that is on her is to receive
[1:30:08] christ not not a teaching a man she's
[1:30:11] not anointed to receive a church or an
[1:30:14] understanding of man but divine
[1:30:16] intelligence is so anointed this people
[1:30:19] to receive christ in the hour that he
[1:30:22] would reveal himself amen i'll tell you
[1:30:25] this it's a divine intelligence that
[1:30:27] puts her there see it's brother by him
[1:30:29] says you know you can take a bunch of
[1:30:31] trumpets and lay them all out he said
[1:30:33] but there's no difference in the
[1:30:34] trumpets he said the only thing you're
[1:30:36] going to know any difference is the
[1:30:38] intelligence of the one playing it
[1:30:40] hey man he said he said i'm just a
[1:30:42] trumpet he said but there's some
[1:30:44] intelligence that's behind it when you
[1:30:46] when you think of what a trumpet player
[1:30:48] can do they can take you know the
[1:30:50] greatest music in the world could be
[1:30:51] written on the sheet of paper and handed
[1:30:53] to you but if you don't understand sheet
[1:30:55] music it has no value to you you could
[1:30:58] be holding a beethoven's work or
[1:31:00] mozart's work and it wouldn't mean
[1:31:02] nothing to you because you have no way
[1:31:04] to interpret the symbol that's written
[1:31:06] on the page but if somebody who has an
[1:31:09] ability to interpret the symbol can put
[1:31:12] a sound out that'll bypass the borders
[1:31:15] come on of religion it'll bypass the
[1:31:18] borders of language one beautiful thing
[1:31:20] about music is it has no boundaries it
[1:31:23] has no education or no education it has
[1:31:26] no boundaries it has the same sound and
[1:31:29] a man with a trumpet that understands
[1:31:31] the symbol can give a sound of
[1:31:33] understanding to all walks of life amen
[1:31:36] and so has been the manifestation of
[1:31:39] christ in the hour that we're living him
[1:31:42] when that manifestation takes place it
[1:31:45] goes across the borders of societies of
[1:31:48] languages
[1:31:49] of racial differences it bypasses the
[1:31:53] whole thing and raises christ among the
[1:31:55] people the symbol that was written in
[1:31:58] the bible is no longer a symbol it is a
[1:32:01] divine intelligence made manifest in our
[1:32:04] hour to bring a group together that
[1:32:06] would be called believers
[1:32:09] oh brother when i think of this when i
[1:32:11] think the trumpet sounding amen oh how
[1:32:14] he can pick it up amen when that when
[1:32:17] that in the beginning god had something
[1:32:18] in his mind but when he wrote it out in
[1:32:20] the bible it was a book of symbols and
[1:32:23] it laid there as a symbol and said it
[1:32:26] would remain as a symbol it would remain
[1:32:28] in silence until the end time there was
[1:32:31] going to come somebody with an
[1:32:33] understanding that would sound the
[1:32:35] mysteries of this bible and make the
[1:32:38] symbol a meaning to the people that is
[1:32:40] sitting there i'm on the white horse has
[1:32:42] a meeting now
[1:32:44] that black horse has a meaning now the
[1:32:46] pale horse has a meaning now but so does
[1:32:49] the eagle have a meaning it means power
[1:32:52] to the church it means life to the
[1:32:54] believer it means rapture to the saints
[1:32:57] of god it's amen it means something
[1:32:59] today
[1:33:00] the prophet of god said see the next
[1:33:02] thing to come is the divine intelligence
[1:33:04] we're not living in a foot age no longer
[1:33:07] we're not in a hip age this evening
[1:33:09] we're not standing a shoulder age or a
[1:33:11] mouth age or even the ih but a divine
[1:33:13] intelligence has come down among the
[1:33:15] people it's god's thinking about god's
[1:33:18] own word
[1:33:19] oh when i think of this i'll tell you
[1:33:21] this we're at the top of the mountain
[1:33:23] now
[1:33:24] hey man the place where the headstone
[1:33:27] comes and meets the body
[1:33:29] under that meeting what a beautiful
[1:33:31] thing
[1:33:32] it's a time when god
[1:33:34] is calling his people to him
[1:33:36] when god is calling his people out of
[1:33:38] this babylon system and all the ideas of
[1:33:42] man and bringing them out of the
[1:33:44] filthiness of the understandings of
[1:33:46] man's ideas and bringing them out in a
[1:33:48] place where they can believe god and
[1:33:50] into an atmosphere where all the
[1:33:52] unbelief is done away with and all the
[1:33:54] ideas of free gods and
[1:33:56] misunderstandings of being a church
[1:33:59] member and living in sin and ungodliness
[1:34:01] in their life amen god is bringing the
[1:34:03] people out to an atmosphere to believe
[1:34:06] every word the bible says i believe
[1:34:08] everything that god says about it in his
[1:34:11] word when i look at the scriptures jesus
[1:34:14] picked the season and then he picked the
[1:34:16] word and identified the season they was
[1:34:19] living in in the word he took the word
[1:34:22] and said to them if you were living in
[1:34:24] jesus time and you were poor do you know
[1:34:26] you could have got up and began to shout
[1:34:29] if you were captive you could have got
[1:34:31] up in claim i'm free what was bringing
[1:34:34] it the word in its season had brought an
[1:34:37] anointing to the people that were
[1:34:40] declared in the scriptures
[1:34:42] oh brother
[1:34:43] when you begin to look in this bible and
[1:34:45] see that god has a season he has a word
[1:34:48] for a season and the hearer of that word
[1:34:51] reflects the season they're living in
[1:34:54] all the people that heard martin luther
[1:34:56] left with something they didn't just get
[1:34:59] a shot in good time they left with
[1:35:01] something they left justified the people
[1:35:04] that was under john wesley they didn't
[1:35:06] just hear something amen that they could
[1:35:08] leave and say i was a good sermon they
[1:35:10] left sanctified by the word that they
[1:35:12] were hearing those pentecostals got an
[1:35:14] anointing of visions and gifts and
[1:35:17] prophecy and tongues but this bride is
[1:35:20] going to leave with something brother so
[1:35:22] he's got her arm in the arm of the word
[1:35:24] and god's going to leave with something
[1:35:26] he's going to leave with a pride we're
[1:35:28] taking a rapture church we're taking it
[1:35:31] by the season by the word and the season
[1:35:34] we're living in
[1:35:37] oh when you look in this bible
[1:35:39] it reflects what time we're living in
[1:35:42] in revelations the 18th chapter he said
[1:35:44] i saw another angel coming down from
[1:35:47] heaven having a great power and the
[1:35:49] earth was lighted with his glory and he
[1:35:52] cried mightily with a strong voice
[1:35:54] saying babylon the greatest fall and
[1:35:56] it's falling look at what he had to say
[1:35:58] about her she's become the habitation of
[1:36:01] devils and the hold of every foul spirit
[1:36:04] and the cage of every unclean
[1:36:06] and hateful bird
[1:36:08] amen i'll tell you what for the believer
[1:36:09] it's a powerful thing the one that makes
[1:36:11] this known amen this is a this is a very
[1:36:15] prophecy out of the book of isaiah the
[1:36:18] 21st chapter and the ninth verse it and
[1:36:20] it's beautiful for the believer to know
[1:36:22] brother branham uses for a text watchman
[1:36:25] what of the night isaiah chapter 21 that
[1:36:28] watchmen on the watchtower had the same
[1:36:31] thing to say in the book of isaiah that
[1:36:33] this angel in the book of revelations is
[1:36:35] saying amen babylon is falling it's
[1:36:39] falling when ezekiel saw her he said
[1:36:42] she's become foul and unclean and the
[1:36:45] gods of the earth amen it was full of
[1:36:47] the whole thing you know what it says
[1:36:49] she become the habitations of it brother
[1:36:51] man preaches blasphemous names he
[1:36:54] preaches broken cisterns he said why is
[1:36:56] she full of it he said because it's
[1:36:58] cages that are blasphemous names who are
[1:37:01] living in broken sisters
[1:37:03] sisters of the world made man-made
[1:37:06] systems to attract every unclean loving
[1:37:09] bird every person that wants to live in
[1:37:12] filth and sin and ungodliness amen
[1:37:15] there's a cage built for them this
[1:37:17] morning it's a religious cage that they
[1:37:19] built but the prophet said it was going
[1:37:21] to come
[1:37:23] now look look at the beauty of this the
[1:37:25] prophet of god said here's the thing the
[1:37:27] blasphemous names see a power has
[1:37:30] written a name on the church amen it's a
[1:37:32] blasphemous name what they've done is
[1:37:34] they've taken a crowbird
[1:37:36] and they put some dove feathers and then
[1:37:38] they call it a dove
[1:37:40] now that ain't a dove that's a crow with
[1:37:42] their feathers and that's what the world
[1:37:44] has done they take a
[1:37:47] sin uh
[1:37:47] person put them in the church and say
[1:37:50] that's a real believer
[1:37:52] the prophet of god said see it's a
[1:37:53] blasphemous names and what is happening
[1:37:56] is now watch the beast power of rome
[1:38:00] has wrote their name on the people
[1:38:04] they've written their interpretation of
[1:38:07] the scripture right in the life of the
[1:38:10] people how did they do it they took over
[1:38:12] pulpits
[1:38:14] they took over schools they took over
[1:38:16] seminaries and taught the people a
[1:38:19] religious deception that would fill up
[1:38:22] these cages
[1:38:24] oh now think of this
[1:38:25] because this prophet that sees it
[1:38:28] he don't say this is just america
[1:38:32] he said they have drunk of the wife of
[1:38:33] the wrath for fornication and the kings
[1:38:35] of the earth have committed fornication
[1:38:37] and the merchants of the earth and
[1:38:39] through the abundance of her delicies i
[1:38:41] heard another voice saying come out over
[1:38:43] my people
[1:38:44] and be not partakers of her sin that
[1:38:46] received not her pledge for her sins
[1:38:48] have reached unto heaven and god has
[1:38:50] remembered her iniquity now watch this
[1:38:52] after this thing i saw this angel come
[1:38:55] down i love how brother branham says it
[1:38:57] he said after this thing what is after
[1:38:59] this thing he said see in revelations 10
[1:39:02] the seventh angel's coming and he's an
[1:39:04] eagle to make all the mysteries known
[1:39:06] now john is set marveling at this
[1:39:09] horrible thing he's marveling at her
[1:39:11] beauty and the angel says to him don't
[1:39:13] marvel at it john she's full she's drunk
[1:39:16] with the wine of the saints that has
[1:39:18] been before you this woman is the killer
[1:39:21] of the people of god she slayed the word
[1:39:25] of the lord and and john's marveling at
[1:39:28] her but the angel amen says don't marvel
[1:39:30] at her john and reveals her whoredoms he
[1:39:33] reveals what's behind her come on church
[1:39:36] the prophet of god said it might look
[1:39:37] like a pearly gate but behind it is a
[1:39:39] gate of hell hey man she's painting
[1:39:41] herself up hey man she's put on a i feel
[1:39:44] a theological makeup is that right but
[1:39:47] behind her is the gates of hell
[1:39:50] what has she done now watch what she's
[1:39:52] doing she's made this come forth and
[1:39:54] this angel as he begins to reveal her
[1:39:58] is the same time the revelations are
[1:40:00] breaking that reveals all the secrets
[1:40:02] that's in the bible when those secrets
[1:40:04] are beginning to be revealed it reveals
[1:40:07] this church is falling but at the same
[1:40:10] time he says to another people come out
[1:40:12] over my people now amen i don't know
[1:40:15] about y'all some people seem to be
[1:40:17] ashamed to be called the people of this
[1:40:19] message but amen in light of this i'm
[1:40:22] not ashamed at all to hear that come out
[1:40:24] of her my people
[1:40:26] isn't it something when he preached
[1:40:28] marriage and divorce and brought pardon
[1:40:30] to them that was in trouble amen what he
[1:40:32] said this is to my congregation this is
[1:40:35] to those that follow after me look at
[1:40:37] vacant man's filter this ain't for
[1:40:40] everybody but for the congregation of
[1:40:42] israel when he met him in the sixth
[1:40:44] dimension the bible the angel said to
[1:40:47] him these are your people oh my the
[1:40:51] people of god that was called by a
[1:40:54] message
[1:40:55] it's the people that's coming out
[1:40:57] oh my to think of this
[1:40:59] these faithful and unclean birds you
[1:41:01] ain't finding no eagles in there they
[1:41:04] don't say a thing about eagle being
[1:41:05] there you know why because something's
[1:41:07] been revealed fresh man has been laid
[1:41:10] out and the eagles have left the filth
[1:41:13] behind them and come out for fresh word
[1:41:16] that they might be now the beauty of
[1:41:18] this is coming out of her come out now
[1:41:20] you know there's no other age to go into
[1:41:24] so this call to come out is a call to
[1:41:26] come up
[1:41:27] it's not a call just to come out to
[1:41:29] another age it's a call to come up to
[1:41:31] come up into another faith into another
[1:41:35] atmosphere and not everybody can take
[1:41:37] the step not everybody can reach the gap
[1:41:40] from church to bride not everybody can
[1:41:42] take a step of faith and walk with the
[1:41:44] word of the hour we're living in but
[1:41:46] there is a predestinated bride there is
[1:41:49] a people of god amen that they are
[1:41:52] anointed for the season to believe the
[1:41:55] word of the age they're living in
[1:41:58] well when i think of this this bible
[1:42:00] said this messenger he said he come with
[1:42:03] great power and he lighted the earth
[1:42:05] with his glory
[1:42:07] you know that word power there you know
[1:42:09] in bible power is represented by a beast
[1:42:13] when you when you look in daniel 7
[1:42:15] you'll see four beasts back there that
[1:42:17] daniel sees and he sees the kingdoms of
[1:42:19] the world divided in four different
[1:42:21] kingdoms and when he sees that he
[1:42:24] excelled these as kingdoms they were all
[1:42:26] gentile kingdoms and those kingdoms when
[1:42:29] when you look at them it calls them a
[1:42:31] beast which is an untamed therion it's a
[1:42:34] it's something can't receive headship
[1:42:36] but that same beast is seen in
[1:42:37] revelations 13
[1:42:39] but it's all together and o rome
[1:42:42] resurrects itself now and comes back to
[1:42:45] the earth and here it is with a false
[1:42:47] interpretation of the word to bring the
[1:42:50] power of death right on the people
[1:42:52] now watch it death is going to ride his
[1:42:55] horse that pale is going to ride death
[1:42:57] and hell is going to follow after it
[1:42:59] disbelief of the word it's going to
[1:43:01] bring hell it's going to bring death
[1:43:04] it's going to bring filthiness and
[1:43:05] uncleanliness but there's a bride that's
[1:43:08] fallen another power the power she's
[1:43:11] following it's an eagle power
[1:43:14] oh brother let me tell you this the
[1:43:15] power that god's got is not just for
[1:43:17] heaven it's for the church
[1:43:20] the bible said and it was lighted with
[1:43:22] his glory
[1:43:23] the earth was lighted
[1:43:25] you ever study there where brother
[1:43:27] braham talks about the four anointings
[1:43:29] he calls them powers
[1:43:31] he calls them powers he says they call
[1:43:32] them beasts he said but there's a better
[1:43:34] word living creature revelation chapter
[1:43:36] four a living creature he said watch the
[1:43:38] number of them there's four of them man
[1:43:40] lion oxen eagle
[1:43:42] now those four anointings he said the
[1:43:44] number has relevance to us it's an
[1:43:46] earthly number
[1:43:47] amen he said watch four days lazarus was
[1:43:50] raised watch how jesus and the son of
[1:43:52] man was the fourth man in the fire he
[1:43:55] said four represents earth deliverance
[1:43:57] on the earth that's why the first time
[1:43:59] they come up what are they doing they're
[1:44:01] protecting the garden of eden
[1:44:03] the tree of life is there
[1:44:05] they're protecting the garden eating
[1:44:07] next time you see them in the scripture
[1:44:08] what are they doing they're protecting
[1:44:10] the word among israel
[1:44:13] got two million people and they're all
[1:44:15] camped out and got squadrons they got
[1:44:17] three camps in the north they got three
[1:44:19] camps in the east three camps in the
[1:44:21] south three camps in the west and
[1:44:23] they're all camping under banners lion
[1:44:26] ox man eagle
[1:44:27] what are they doing they're all
[1:44:29] protecting one thing there's a tent out
[1:44:31] in the middle of it and there's a banner
[1:44:34] over that tent but it's a pillar of fire
[1:44:36] banner amen and inside the tent is
[1:44:40] another four creatures
[1:44:42] the cherubims are sitting on the mercy
[1:44:44] seat and they're protecting one thing
[1:44:46] again they're protecting the word that
[1:44:49] is among the people the place that god's
[1:44:52] gonna meet with him the cherubims are
[1:44:54] there at that place
[1:44:56] oh brother little did we understand when
[1:44:59] we saw that until matthew mark luke and
[1:45:01] john come along and when they come along
[1:45:04] there were four gospels surrounding one
[1:45:07] book of acts that wasn't the acts of
[1:45:09] apostles that was the acts of god in the
[1:45:12] apostles
[1:45:14] the four anointings was perfecting one
[1:45:16] thing god acting at his word in the
[1:45:20] flesh of humankind
[1:45:22] no wonder it was protecting that tent
[1:45:24] back there oh i'll tell you this god's
[1:45:26] anointing is his power his power is a
[1:45:29] quickening power it's not just a bunch
[1:45:32] of dead letters on a page
[1:45:34] it's a quitting power
[1:45:37] when you see those anointings up through
[1:45:38] the ages they're protecting something
[1:45:41] they're not just protecting they're
[1:45:42] empowering now think about they they
[1:45:45] they're all warring with these horses
[1:45:46] coming up through the you all believers
[1:45:48] so i won't have to explain it but
[1:45:50] they're all warring coming up to the end
[1:45:52] and all the time death is getting
[1:45:54] stronger
[1:45:55] but life is getting greater two
[1:45:58] influences are happening babylon begins
[1:46:00] to fall the power of death has begun to
[1:46:04] take her the same anointing that
[1:46:06] anointed the serpent in the garden
[1:46:09] that his influence caused god to curse
[1:46:11] the serpent and put him on his belly to
[1:46:14] never rise again
[1:46:16] is that right that same anointing has
[1:46:18] fell on the end time and the churches
[1:46:20] have fell under it and they're falling
[1:46:23] they're falling under the influence of
[1:46:24] confusion and death and ungodliness amen
[1:46:28] but there's another anointing the one
[1:46:30] that adam walked away from the one that
[1:46:33] he walked away from has been loosed out
[1:46:36] of the blood cell and come back on the
[1:46:38] church again in the power of the holy
[1:46:41] ghost not a man to bring the church down
[1:46:44] but to pull her up to bring her up to
[1:46:47] another level the power
[1:46:49] the power of the resurrection see we're
[1:46:51] receiving the life of christ but it's
[1:46:53] not just the life it's the resurrected
[1:46:56] life
[1:46:58] oh my think of this now
[1:47:00] coming right into the end
[1:47:02] no wonder he's calling him out of the
[1:47:04] church
[1:47:05] church is falling
[1:47:07] brides rising
[1:47:08] two different things are happening at
[1:47:10] the same time why is it happening
[1:47:12] because see sin and ungodliness has
[1:47:14] brought a fall but the word has brought
[1:47:16] deliverance for the children of god
[1:47:18] look at the seas that we're living in
[1:47:20] rising and falling at the same time once
[1:47:23] being built up in faith while the other
[1:47:25] is driven down in death and ungodliness
[1:47:28] why is that church falling they put
[1:47:30] cursed things in her foundation
[1:47:33] they put cursed things in her wall amen
[1:47:35] they put un un uh um how would i say it
[1:47:39] uh time don't lock me a long time here
[1:47:41] but i'll say this i used to be an
[1:47:43] inspector in a city and i would go
[1:47:44] inspect some bridges and things like
[1:47:46] that you know what we had to watch
[1:47:49] we had to watch the steel that went in
[1:47:50] the concrete
[1:47:52] and we had to measure the concrete what
[1:47:53] poundage they put there because them
[1:47:55] contractors knew
[1:47:57] that they knew what the specs called for
[1:47:59] but they had buddies in the companies
[1:48:01] that got the concrete and the steel and
[1:48:03] all this stuff and what they do is
[1:48:04] they'd make a deal behind the scenes and
[1:48:06] they'd say now the specs call for this
[1:48:08] so you send this and call it this
[1:48:11] you you it calls for a number one steel
[1:48:13] bar to go on the bridge great
[1:48:15] you know maybe it's costing number one
[1:48:16] but they'd make a deal so tell you what
[1:48:18] you do you send number four bar it's
[1:48:20] it's a dollar and a half bar cheaper and
[1:48:22] if you're gonna spend a thousand bars
[1:48:23] and start making some money so he said
[1:48:25] you send the other bars and just send
[1:48:28] the manifest to say it's a number one
[1:48:30] bar we'll give it to the inspector we'll
[1:48:32] split the money but what goes in the
[1:48:34] building is not what the spec said it
[1:48:36] should be unless you know what you're
[1:48:38] looking at
[1:48:39] unless you know what you're looking for
[1:48:42] they then it's put in the building and
[1:48:44] nobody knows the difference till the
[1:48:46] thing falls down
[1:48:48] are you with me and the whole world
[1:48:50] thinks the church is standing they think
[1:48:52] it's in power but when the great shaking
[1:48:55] begins which we've already begun to
[1:48:57] arrive even at the same time when she
[1:49:00] starts falling
[1:49:02] the church has already been mourned come
[1:49:03] out of her because she's gonna fall down
[1:49:06] now they had sense enough to listen
[1:49:08] no different than that bunch of cattle
[1:49:10] and birds and everything else over in
[1:49:11] india when the earthquake started coming
[1:49:13] they got away from the walls brother
[1:49:15] because they knew the things that's
[1:49:16] gonna fall down that's why the church
[1:49:18] got away from systems of organization
[1:49:20] man-made ideas of the word they got away
[1:49:23] from it because god's instrument of
[1:49:26] divine intelligence has told them to
[1:49:28] come
[1:49:29] come right out of this thing see the
[1:49:31] church has fallen down
[1:49:33] but the bride she's rising up
[1:49:36] she's coming up higher than she's ever
[1:49:38] been before what's god doing he's
[1:49:40] building her up he's building her up
[1:49:43] upon divine
[1:49:45] revelation
[1:49:47] building her up on divine revelation
[1:49:51] now i want you to think of this this
[1:49:53] ain't much different brother i'm
[1:49:54] spreading spiritual food and due season
[1:49:56] it's not much different than elijah's
[1:49:58] day
[1:49:59] something happened in elijah's day ahab
[1:50:01] married jezebel
[1:50:03] and jezebel bewitched the country into
[1:50:05] evil things
[1:50:06] and what her greatest sin was they
[1:50:08] worshipped other gods and when they
[1:50:10] started worshiping other gods god sent a
[1:50:12] man who wasn't tied to none of them he
[1:50:15] wasn't tied to none of their systems or
[1:50:16] their ideas he comes stepping out of the
[1:50:18] wilderness and had divine authority he
[1:50:21] come stood right before ahead and said
[1:50:23] is god liveth i'm his servant and they
[1:50:25] ain't even ring on false i ask it to
[1:50:27] come
[1:50:28] well who do you think you are
[1:50:31] i'll tell you who he was he was god's
[1:50:33] servant
[1:50:34] and he was there to proclaim the god you
[1:50:36] quit serving still alive
[1:50:39] just because israel didn't serve him
[1:50:40] anymore didn't mean he wasn't still god
[1:50:43] and god was going to show him through
[1:50:44] judgment the same way he showed them
[1:50:46] through mercy i'm still a living god
[1:50:48] and look at what he done he dried up the
[1:50:50] heavens and elijah goes down the brook
[1:50:52] chair for a while but the rain still
[1:50:54] didn't come so drought settled on the
[1:50:56] whole country of israel and if you
[1:50:58] follow luke chapter four you'll find in
[1:51:00] the next few verses from where i read
[1:51:02] jesus begins to refer to this and he
[1:51:05] said listen now it was an elijah's time
[1:51:07] when a drought come he said there were
[1:51:09] many widows in israel why was it elijah
[1:51:13] went out to the widow of xeropath who
[1:51:15] was down at zion
[1:51:16] amen there's a lot of people in israel
[1:51:19] but that elijah anointing
[1:51:21] left israel and went to a little widow
[1:51:24] woman who was a gentile who had a child
[1:51:27] that was perishing among church she
[1:51:30] without a vision she was going to perish
[1:51:33] but there was no prophet's promise to
[1:51:35] her but god showed a symbol that he knew
[1:51:39] what he was hiding from other men and
[1:51:41] sent elijah to a gentile woman
[1:51:45] oh
[1:51:46] hallelujah and you're glad elijah went
[1:51:48] to her
[1:51:49] what a symbol that was in the bible that
[1:51:52] god hid from the theologian but he knew
[1:51:55] by foreknowledge he was laying out a
[1:51:57] plan
[1:51:58] i'm going to go to a little woman who's
[1:52:00] a gentile woman wow while israel is over
[1:52:03] there and this other thing i'm gonna go
[1:52:05] minister to her
[1:52:07] when he found her she was out getting
[1:52:08] her last bit of meal
[1:52:10] she ran out of food brother
[1:52:12] she yeah things would have gotten bad
[1:52:14] shape
[1:52:15] and when he walked over to her and asked
[1:52:16] her what she was doing she began to tell
[1:52:18] him he said well i'll tell you what you
[1:52:19] do go get me a drink
[1:52:21] he said why are you in there fix me kate
[1:52:23] and bring it to me and that little
[1:52:25] sister god bless her heart she said you
[1:52:27] know what preacher i ain't got a cake i
[1:52:30] just got a morsel he said bring it to me
[1:52:32] then
[1:52:33] hey man i'll tell you what she didn't
[1:52:34] have much left brother crow but the
[1:52:36] elijah demanded all she had he demanded
[1:52:39] the last morsel she had amen to give up
[1:52:42] every bit of i hope you're listening to
[1:52:44] me i'm not talking about something back
[1:52:46] there i'm talking about today
[1:52:50] we got these little ideas left around
[1:52:52] we got these understandings that's
[1:52:54] laying around
[1:52:56] oh but brother if elijah's going to give
[1:52:58] something to this church they got to
[1:53:00] give every bit of it up they got to say
[1:53:02] hey that's the lord liveth i got one
[1:53:04] morsel but i'm going to give it away i'm
[1:53:07] going to turn it all over this morning
[1:53:12] when she turned that over you know what
[1:53:13] happened to her
[1:53:15] she heard atomic words
[1:53:17] thus saith the lord
[1:53:19] your meal barrel will never go dry
[1:53:22] and you're cursive oil and never go down
[1:53:24] look at what he began to do and she
[1:53:26] began the bible says by the word of the
[1:53:28] lord that came through elijah she began
[1:53:31] to live on it
[1:53:32] it was a sustaining food it was a
[1:53:35] sustaining life in the middle of
[1:53:37] judgments in the middle of the greatest
[1:53:39] drought and the great wickedness of the
[1:53:41] age she was sustained because she met
[1:53:45] elijah
[1:53:46] hallelujah that's coming today church
[1:53:49] and it already is now that the world is
[1:53:52] going to take the food away from the
[1:53:54] children of god and and give them humble
[1:53:56] pie the witches had to hold up
[1:53:59] gonna give them poison food some witch
[1:54:01] is doctored up somewhere and they'll
[1:54:02] call it an apple or a humble pie or
[1:54:05] whatever they want to call it but it'll
[1:54:06] be indoctrinated with doctrines of
[1:54:09] devils but god has a church that don't
[1:54:12] have to eat it
[1:54:14] because they got a food that's been
[1:54:16] hidden
[1:54:17] they don't have to eat it
[1:54:18] don't have to worry about it
[1:54:21] can you can you imagine
[1:54:23] can you imagine this little woman in
[1:54:25] here
[1:54:26] a few days later
[1:54:27] and her son dies by some other cause
[1:54:30] and she goes in there and says elijah
[1:54:32] what happened i was good to you and it
[1:54:35] seems like god has brought memory to my
[1:54:37] sin
[1:54:38] now the bible says that's what happens
[1:54:39] to babylon
[1:54:41] that god remembers her seeing he takes
[1:54:42] the covers off of her and he brings
[1:54:44] judgment on
[1:54:45] she knows this elijah is bringing
[1:54:46] judgment
[1:54:48] and it seems as though this judgment's
[1:54:49] fell on her home
[1:54:51] and she says what's the matter elijah he
[1:54:52] said wait a minute and he shows the
[1:54:54] restoration doesn't he he takes that
[1:54:56] little boy and lays him in there on the
[1:54:57] bed of the prophet and lays right over
[1:55:00] and begins to sneeze seven times and
[1:55:02] breath becomes back into his body
[1:55:04] amen
[1:55:05] and when he brings forth the child and
[1:55:07] says see it still lives it's been
[1:55:09] revived from the dead this will be good
[1:55:11] for you and your children believe me
[1:55:13] amen and and watch what happens now
[1:55:16] maybe she goes out that morning brother
[1:55:18] homer and somebody stand out on the
[1:55:19] fence out there and she can hear the
[1:55:20] people talking out there well someday
[1:55:23] god's gonna do something great in our
[1:55:24] country
[1:55:25] someday god's gonna do some great things
[1:55:27] among us and i'll tell you one day it's
[1:55:29] gonna come some cloud of rain somewhere
[1:55:31] that god god's gonna have to do
[1:55:33] something someday to bring revival you
[1:55:34] know and can you imagine that little
[1:55:36] woman over her arm about knee deep over
[1:55:39] in a mill barrel with her hand full of
[1:55:41] meal that was completely supernatural
[1:55:43] food and there she sat without in her
[1:55:46] hand and they was over saying one of
[1:55:48] these days god's going to i'll tell you
[1:55:50] this she took that mill barrel out there
[1:55:52] and said i've already got my revival
[1:55:55] amen i'm in the middle of a great
[1:55:56] revival
[1:55:58] oh i'll tell you this people are waiting
[1:55:59] on god to do something but this blind
[1:56:02] knows god has done something
[1:56:05] you know why they can't get nothing
[1:56:06] because they won't give everything over
[1:56:08] they got to keep a hold of their ideas
[1:56:10] and systems of man but that's what
[1:56:12] caused the whole church to fall was
[1:56:14] contaminated ideas of man
[1:56:18] when she gave everything what's the
[1:56:20] power she found
[1:56:21] right in that same bucket brother said
[1:56:23] that hidden man was christ
[1:56:26] that hidden man was christ and she
[1:56:27] reached in there and got a handful of
[1:56:28] christ every morning you know what
[1:56:30] happens when you open up spiritual food
[1:56:32] and due season today
[1:56:34] i'm on the property god said i thought
[1:56:35] these seals and thunders was something
[1:56:37] that was going to come later that was
[1:56:38] written on the backside of the book he
[1:56:40] said oh no he showed me the other day
[1:56:42] these were lost things that were already
[1:56:44] written but they were just hidden from
[1:56:46] man
[1:56:49] but when god began to reveal them
[1:56:51] they're no longer hidden they're food
[1:56:53] for the believer that's hearing the
[1:56:56] words of elijah yeah
[1:56:58] and the hours she's living in
[1:57:00] look at this
[1:57:02] i'm closing look at this
[1:57:04] look at this power she lived on daily
[1:57:07] feasted daily on power
[1:57:09] the power she made steps by coming out
[1:57:11] of that mill burrow the power that her
[1:57:13] little boy played out in the yard come
[1:57:14] out of that mill barrel her revival
[1:57:16] brought power to her the world didn't
[1:57:17] know nothing about
[1:57:18] it was hidden away that same hidden man
[1:57:21] it was what moses put it back there in
[1:57:22] the intervale
[1:57:23] he put it in the holy of holies it was
[1:57:25] the same manner that fell for moses
[1:57:28] hundreds of years later a young priest
[1:57:29] come to maturity they'd take him behind
[1:57:31] the veil
[1:57:32] and they'd give him a taste of that
[1:57:34] original manna and he could come out of
[1:57:36] there and his mouth would be a witness
[1:57:38] our god lives he's the same that was
[1:57:40] there he's still the same today but he's
[1:57:43] the same in behind the veil
[1:57:48] now think of this
[1:57:50] because the same thing that peter and
[1:57:51] paul had
[1:57:53] way back here they had it
[1:57:55] they had that manner they had the
[1:57:57] original word they had the original
[1:57:58] blood they had the original way of god
[1:58:01] but then jesus said unto them yet a
[1:58:03] little while the world gonna see me no
[1:58:04] more he said but i will be with you
[1:58:08] as i will be in you and the prophet of
[1:58:11] god said see there he's hidden manna
[1:58:13] today steel he's hidden from the world
[1:58:16] but he's our power our quickening power
[1:58:20] look at the bible it said they'll
[1:58:21] they'll have a form of godliness but
[1:58:23] they'll deny the power thereof
[1:58:28] oh we thought that was this power to
[1:58:29] speak in tongues and see visions the
[1:58:31] prophet of god said the power thereof
[1:58:33] vindicated word resurrection power what
[1:58:36] is jesus the word made manifest in the
[1:58:39] hour you're living here what did they
[1:58:41] kick out in revelations 3 jesus was on
[1:58:44] the outside of the church it was the
[1:58:46] revealed word that they put out of the
[1:58:48] church
[1:58:49] and they invited man's ideas in
[1:58:52] but i love that little person that he
[1:58:54] put there for you and me he said but if
[1:58:56] any man will come unto me
[1:58:58] i'll come into him and i will sup with
[1:59:01] him brother man said see he'll reveal
[1:59:03] all these secret things to you
[1:59:07] friends because we got elijah
[1:59:10] because we got the ministry of the hour
[1:59:13] god has given a revival to this church
[1:59:16] quickening power
[1:59:17] what happened on mount sunset probably
[1:59:19] god says it's not the intelligence of a
[1:59:21] man he said it was the quickening power
[1:59:23] of god
[1:59:24] coming back to the church
[1:59:27] dynamics
[1:59:28] has hit the mechanics the power of the
[1:59:30] word has strengthened the believers now
[1:59:32] we're living you love him won't you
[1:59:34] stand your feet with us
[1:59:37] there's a power
[1:59:41] hey man these musicians come
[1:59:44] you know the prophet said one day he was
[1:59:45] standing
[1:59:47] he was standing out next to a garage
[1:59:49] he'd seen a man pull up and he had a car
[1:59:52] all the mechanics was there he said but
[1:59:54] it just wasn't running
[1:59:55] and he asked the mechanic over there to
[1:59:57] fix it for him he's in a hurry
[1:59:59] and that pressure got on him
[2:00:00] get this thing fixed
[2:00:02] and he couldn't get it and some feller
[2:00:04] stand over beside a minute walked over
[2:00:05] and said let me help you fix it
[2:00:08] he said you know what's wrong with it
[2:00:09] they just ain't no current in it
[2:00:11] and the old boy tweaked this and tweaked
[2:00:12] that and the car started right up
[2:00:15] he let all the pressure off the mechanic
[2:00:17] yes because the one that had built the
[2:00:19] car showed up on the scene all right
[2:00:22] i'll tell you what friend brother
[2:00:23] brandon said what's wrong with our
[2:00:24] revivals
[2:00:25] he said this is what's wrong when we let
[2:00:27] go of every creed
[2:00:29] in every dogma
[2:00:30] he said then the dynamics construct the
[2:00:32] mechanics
[2:00:34] for the going away of the church you
[2:00:35] love him
[2:00:36] god bless you brother homer
