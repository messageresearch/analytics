[31:47] in the name of jesus christ we pray amen
[31:50] amen
[31:53] so
[31:54] matthew chapter 15 beginning at verse 1
[31:58] says then came to jesus scribes and
[32:01] pharisees which were of jerusalem
[32:04] saying
[32:06] why do thy disciples transgress the
[32:08] tradition of the elders for they wash
[32:11] not their hands when they eat bread but
[32:14] he answered
[32:16] and said unto them
[32:17] why do ye also transgress the
[32:19] commandment of god by your tradition
[32:22] for god commanded saying honor the
[32:24] father and mother and he's he that
[32:27] curseth father or mother let him die the
[32:30] death
[32:31] but ye say
[32:32] whosoever shall say to his father his
[32:34] mother it is a gift but whatsoever
[32:39] thou mightest be profited by me and
[32:42] honor not his father or his mother he
[32:45] shall be free
[32:46] thus have you made the commandment of
[32:48] god of none effect by your tradition
[32:50] you hypocrites well did isaiah prophesy
[32:54] of you saying this people draweth an eye
[32:57] unto me with their mouth and honoreth me
[32:59] with their lips but their heart is far
[33:01] from me
[33:02] but in vain do they worship me
[33:05] teaching for doctrines
[33:08] the commandments
[33:09] of men
[33:10] amen so god bless you you may be seated
[33:13] tonight
[33:15] and
[33:17] i take a little title in vain they do
[33:19] worship me
[33:23] and
[33:31] you know the word the word vain
[33:34] when you look it up in
[33:36] in the dictionary when you go back and
[33:38] and you look at the definition
[33:42] it means in vain
[33:44] means a an emptiness
[33:47] or a
[33:48] a hollowness
[33:51] or a uselessness
[33:54] and so you know he said in vain do they
[33:57] worship me so it's a
[33:59] you know as a uselessness it's a useless
[34:02] thing that they're doing or you know
[34:04] it's a shallow or a hollow thing that
[34:07] that they're doing
[34:09] and
[34:10] you know he
[34:11] when jesus comes here and
[34:13] and the disciples or i'm sorry the
[34:15] pharisees and the scribes when they come
[34:18] you know
[34:19] they were so
[34:22] enjoying they were so connected to their
[34:25] tradition
[34:27] because you know their tradition
[34:30] had had taken on the same
[34:33] uh
[34:34] equivalency
[34:36] as the law as the as the word did
[34:40] and you know when they come they said
[34:41] you know
[34:42] why is it that that you have your uh
[34:45] disciples not wash their hands
[34:52] but jesus
[34:54] coming and he said but why is it that
[34:55] you transgress the commandment of god
[34:59] by your tradition
[35:03] he said hey when he come here and he
[35:05] said the scripture says for god
[35:06] commanded to honor your father and your
[35:08] mother
[35:12] you know it's the it's the first uh
[35:16] it's the first commandment with promise
[35:19] but here you come and he said why is it
[35:21] that but he said y'all
[35:23] you you've made this rule
[35:26] that if if you say well um
[35:29] i would like to help you but i can't
[35:33] and it and it's it's very interesting
[35:34] when you when you look at it is they say
[35:36] well everything that i have i've
[35:37] dedicated to god
[35:40] well i can't i can't help you because
[35:42] whatever i would use to profit you
[35:45] it belongs to god has been dedicated
[35:48] but the interesting point about that is
[35:50] when you look at that
[35:52] if it was dedicated and if and if it was
[35:54] consecrated it was given to god then why
[35:56] do they still have possession of that's
[35:58] right
[35:59] so they were here they are and they were
[36:01] saying well it's been dedicated to god
[36:03] but but i'm going to be the one that's
[36:04] going to be the uh
[36:06] caretaker of it
[36:08] i'm going to be in possession of it but
[36:10] i can't give it to you
[36:13] and they said well you know because now
[36:15] it's okay because uh we've bypassed
[36:18] we've bypassed the word because we've
[36:20] not broken the law
[36:23] and jesus and jesus is saying but yeah
[36:25] but the scripture says
[36:27] to honor your father and mother
[36:30] and and so he said that that's what it
[36:33] says
[36:34] and so when you look at how you honor
[36:37] your father and your mother
[36:40] it's not it's not just by lip service
[36:43] but by an expression by an action
[36:47] so when you do these things then you
[36:49] honor your father and your mother
[36:51] but see when he take when he goes to the
[36:53] scripture and he takes this as a natural
[36:55] scene and then when he continues on in
[36:57] this
[36:58] then he comes to isaiah and he says see
[37:01] you fulfilled isaiah's prophecy
[37:05] because he said not only do you don't
[37:07] you don't honor your father and your
[37:09] mother
[37:10] in a simple thing that you could do but
[37:12] all of a sudden now we look and he said
[37:15] isaiah prophesied of y'all and he said
[37:17] he said that the people draw now with
[37:20] their mouth
[37:21] and their lips but he said their heart
[37:23] is far from me
[37:25] and he said it's the exact same thing
[37:27] it's the same fulfillment of the word
[37:29] that they do with their father and their
[37:30] mother they do with god amen
[37:33] and it's a very simple thing
[37:35] because you know that you would take
[37:37] care of your your your parents you would
[37:39] try to help them
[37:41] but all of a sudden he takes it right
[37:43] back to the scripture and says he said
[37:45] but in vain do they worship me
[37:49] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[37:51] of men
[37:54] and so i want to i want to look at this
[37:56] tonight
[37:58] when he speaks of in
[37:59] worship
[38:01] what does it mean to worship
[38:04] and so he said in vain do they worship
[38:06] me teaching for doctrines the
[38:08] commandments of men
[38:10] so they laid all this you know they lay
[38:13] all their emphasis upon the teaching of
[38:15] the elders
[38:18] now and when we go to mark chapter 7 and
[38:21] and jesus speaking to the scribes and
[38:23] the pharisees when when they come in and
[38:25] mark's account of it he says for laying
[38:28] aside the commandment of god ye hold the
[38:30] tradition of men as the washing of pots
[38:32] and cups and many other such things such
[38:35] like things you do
[38:38] and he said unto them full well ye
[38:40] reject the commandment of god
[38:43] that ye may keep your own tradition
[38:47] so you know as jesus said hey full well
[38:50] you've turned the word down
[38:52] because you've held because when you you
[38:54] can't place anything
[38:57] god will not have anybody that's going
[38:59] to be higher than him
[39:02] they're not there's not going to be any
[39:03] other worship but god
[39:05] amen he's not going to have
[39:07] the word take second place
[39:10] the word will have preeminence he will
[39:12] have preeminence in all things
[39:15] so when he said you've taken it and
[39:17] you've turned the word down full you
[39:18] reject the word the commandment of god
[39:21] that you can live your tradition
[39:24] so when when we go back and we as we
[39:26] were speaking previously when when
[39:29] the word came
[39:31] when the people were connected to their
[39:33] tradition
[39:35] to what what they had been taught as we
[39:37] talked about before when the when the
[39:39] people they didn't understand what to
[39:41] believe because even when when they you
[39:44] know when even when when peter and them
[39:46] came to jesus and they began to speak
[39:48] even they had questions on what he had
[39:50] taught because the elders had taught so
[39:53] many things because the priest had told
[39:55] such
[39:56] doctrines that that they were confused
[39:59] on things
[40:01] even when they saw jesus come and he
[40:03] preached the word to him and then he he
[40:05] told him he said and destroy this temple
[40:07] in three days i'll rise again when he
[40:10] came and he fulfilled the scripture and
[40:13] even when when he fulfilled the
[40:14] scripture and he told him that he would
[40:16] do that and he went and he spoke to
[40:18] cleopas on the road to emmaus and he
[40:20] spoke to him all along the way
[40:23] and he told him what would take place
[40:25] beforehand and when it came to pass and
[40:28] then when he told the disciples that
[40:29] i'll go meet you in galilee he said go
[40:31] tell my disciples and peter
[40:34] to come meet me
[40:36] and yet yet they were slow to believe
[40:38] what was told of them
[40:40] when he when he told them continue to
[40:42] tell them what would take place and then
[40:43] when he told them that they saw him
[40:48] when over 500 saw him resurrected
[40:50] standing in the body with nail prints in
[40:52] his hands and he stood there and he
[40:54] began to talk to them
[40:56] and yet they were still connected to an
[40:58] earthly kingdom that when when they when
[41:01] he was ready to ascend they were saying
[41:03] are you going to re-estate you're going
[41:04] to establish the kingdom now
[41:07] when he stood there and he told when he
[41:09] told pilate he said listen he said if my
[41:11] kingdom was of this world he said my
[41:13] people would stand up and fight but he
[41:15] said we're not of we're not of this
[41:17] world
[41:19] it's not in this kingdom right now in
[41:21] this earth one because i have a i'm
[41:23] doing a work now a ministry now but you
[41:26] know what all of this will come to me i
[41:28] will reign over all of this one day
[41:32] but i'm not coming to that now i'm as a
[41:35] servant
[41:36] fulfilling the scripture
[41:38] but he's pointing the people back to
[41:40] what was already written but they missed
[41:42] it
[41:44] they're still connected to that
[41:46] tradition
[41:53] and even today
[41:55] we have many people that that believe
[41:58] but you know that's the one thing that
[42:00] we have to get over the one thing that
[42:02] the word is to do is to break our own
[42:05] ideas
[42:06] our our traditions our thoughts
[42:09] one because we still haven't why because
[42:11] we're still connected to a carnal mind
[42:15] we still have carnality so we still have
[42:17] thoughts
[42:19] but what does the scripture tell us that
[42:21] we're supposed to bring all thoughts
[42:23] everything under subjection to the word
[42:30] so when when we take these things we
[42:32] must look to see what god wants us to do
[42:34] amen
[42:38] and you know
[42:41] the word
[42:42] worship
[42:45] the word worship means to honor or show
[42:48] reverence for a divine being
[42:52] or supernatural power
[42:54] to regard with great or extravagant
[42:57] respect honor or devotion
[43:00] a form of religious practice with its
[43:03] creed and ritual
[43:04] the act of paying divine honors to the
[43:07] supreme being religious reverence and
[43:09] homage
[43:10] adoration or acts of reverence paid to
[43:13] god
[43:14] or are being viewed as god
[43:17] so when you look at worship
[43:20] many people think that worship has to do
[43:22] with
[43:23] uh
[43:25] you know coming to come into church and
[43:30] uh
[43:31] you know we come in before before the
[43:34] church service and we and we sit down
[43:36] and we read our bible or we listen to
[43:38] brother branham and we get up and we
[43:40] sing three songs and somebody sings a
[43:41] special and you know as brother branham
[43:43] said you know somebody has an
[43:44] outstanding solo and we hear that and
[43:46] then the preacher gets up and preaches
[43:48] you know 45 minutes or 50 minutes and
[43:50] you know we sing two songs and we go
[43:51] home
[43:53] and he's like well that's my duty
[43:55] well that's only part of your duty
[43:57] but people look at worship as well i
[44:00] come to church and i play a musical
[44:03] instrument or i come to church and i
[44:04] sing or i come to church and i clap my
[44:07] hands and they say well this is worship
[44:10] but that's not but that's not all that
[44:12] is that's tied to worship
[44:16] as a as a script you know we say many
[44:18] times people always said let's worship
[44:19] in tithes and offerings one because
[44:22] that's an action so that's something
[44:24] else that we do
[44:26] but many people don't see that as
[44:27] worship
[44:30] they just say well that's something
[44:31] that's just something that we do but no
[44:33] when when you look as doing a religious
[44:36] practice
[44:38] something that you do that honors god
[44:42] whatever that you do
[44:43] honoring god is an act of worship
[44:47] so when it says to give homage to
[44:50] something homage means a special honor
[44:52] or respect shown publicly
[44:55] a formal
[44:57] public
[44:58] acknowledgement of a superior
[45:01] something that shows respect or attest
[45:04] to the worth
[45:06] of
[45:08] worth or
[45:09] influence
[45:10] of another
[45:12] a tribute
[45:17] so when you begin to look at this
[45:19] to understand
[45:21] it's a is a formal public
[45:23] acknowledgement
[45:25] not not just
[45:27] um
[45:29] a
[45:31] you go to a certain
[45:33] place as you know we go to we go to a
[45:36] church to worship god
[45:37] we do but
[45:39] but there's more than than just coming
[45:40] into this four walls and worshiping god
[45:44] an act of worship is something larger
[45:47] and and seeing worship as something that
[45:49] you go and do all the time
[45:53] you know brother branham said in in
[45:57] in the in the message adoption you know
[46:00] he was talking about being in the in
[46:02] heavenly places
[46:04] you know and and he goes and he speaks
[46:07] spanish he said we are assembled in
[46:08] heavenly he said it means the position
[46:11] of the believer
[46:13] it's the position of the believer in
[46:15] christ
[46:18] and you know when we talk about coming
[46:20] into heavenly places it's not the
[46:22] position of the person in church
[46:24] but it's the position of the believer in
[46:26] christ
[46:30] so you know he said he said you know
[46:31] when i'm prayed up and you're prayed up
[46:33] and the church is prayed up then we're
[46:34] ready to hear the message we have
[46:36] assembled ourselves together as saints
[46:37] called out baptized with the holy ghost
[46:40] filled with god's blessing and then he
[46:42] begins to talk about oh brother there
[46:44] you are heavenly atmosphere oh what
[46:46] could happen tonight what could happen
[46:48] tonight if we would be sitting here in a
[46:50] heavenly atmosphere
[46:54] now if we were sitting here because if
[46:56] brother branham said one time he said he
[46:58] said in the pews
[47:00] the empty pews he said if we could look
[47:01] into that other dimension and see the
[47:03] angels that are here
[47:06] see then then we then we'd have a whole
[47:08] different concept of what's going on
[47:09] here
[47:11] because if we could look into that other
[47:13] dimension and see what's going on then
[47:15] you know what we wouldn't be so tired
[47:17] sometimes
[47:20] we we wouldn't we wouldn't allow things
[47:22] to to hinder us so much
[47:26] you know you know
[47:28] this time of year is is one of the most
[47:30] uh
[47:31] for a lot of people's the most exciting
[47:33] time of the whole wide the whole year
[47:36] they wait for this time of year amen
[47:38] you know why
[47:40] because of a eight-letter word
[47:45] you know what it is
[47:47] football
[47:52] you can't spell brother
[47:55] no
[47:56] that would be dear dear
[47:58] dear dear
[48:00] no it's football
[48:03] i mean you got you got everybody you got
[48:05] you got all the clemson people out here
[48:06] and they're riding up and down with
[48:08] tiger tails hanging out the back of
[48:10] their car
[48:12] you got you got people they'll go out
[48:15] someplace and sit and pay hundreds of
[48:17] dollars to go sit in a plastic seat
[48:19] somewhere and don't even have a shirt on
[48:21] to paint their half of their body in a
[48:24] color sometimes two or three colors
[48:28] and you know if you walked out on the
[48:30] street the way some of those people were
[48:31] dressed they'd rest you
[48:34] but you know people dress like that so
[48:35] they can get on tv
[48:39] you know those people you know they get
[48:40] everywhere they everywhere they go it
[48:42] doesn't matter what's going on
[48:44] they got their big g on on their shirt
[48:46] their car
[48:47] everything every every piece of clothing
[48:50] that they have has got a big g on it
[48:53] and everywhere they go you can they
[48:54] can't say hello sometimes people get so
[48:56] excited it's like how about them dogs
[48:57] how about them dogs that's all i can say
[49:00] they can't say nothing else why cause
[49:02] that's football season
[49:04] and you know what it wouldn't matter
[49:06] there's people there's people's been in
[49:08] car wrecks broke bones all kinds of
[49:10] stuff and you know what they'll get in
[49:12] the car and go sit in the sanford
[49:15] stadium and wait till the ball game's
[49:17] over with and then they'll take them to
[49:18] the hospital
[49:21] there's been people that's had heart
[49:23] attacks and they sit there and say don't
[49:24] wait
[49:26] when the game got ahead when they got
[49:28] ahead and their team was winning they
[49:30] said well you can take me to the
[49:31] hospital now
[49:33] you know
[49:34] they excited why because there's
[49:36] something about football that grips them
[49:40] and you know i mean
[49:42] there's some people there's somebody
[49:43] fell at one time he's an alabama fan and
[49:45] he had a tailgating rig and everything
[49:47] like that and he said if alabama played
[49:49] on the moon he'd be taking that stuff
[49:51] and he'd be up there because he'd be
[49:53] watching him play football because
[49:54] that's where his his team is going to be
[49:56] there
[49:59] they get all excited about it
[50:02] but let me tell you something brother
[50:03] sister sometimes what we do is the devil
[50:05] allows we allow the devil to put stuff
[50:07] over our eyes and we don't pay attention
[50:09] on what's going on
[50:11] but you know the man the the one that
[50:14] created all heaven and earth
[50:16] created all things he spoke everything
[50:18] into existence he sent his son he came
[50:22] and died on a cross that for your sins
[50:24] and my sins that he paid the price that
[50:27] you can have healing
[50:29] that you can have all things that you
[50:31] can sit in heavenly places and he's here
[50:33] tonight to meet with you and speak to
[50:35] you but you know what people's
[50:39] it's a like aaron tonight
[50:42] brother
[50:44] maybe he won't be so long
[50:46] but see we miss our opportunity
[50:49] all right
[50:50] come on
[50:51] it's like well it's just brother dale
[50:53] or brother bob
[50:55] no sometimes we fail to realize it's
[50:58] jesus christ
[51:01] when we've come together in his presence
[51:03] he said where two or three are gathered
[51:05] in my name he said i'm go i'm there in
[51:07] the midst
[51:08] so when we come tonight it's not just a
[51:11] tradition it's not just some idea but
[51:13] you know we've come to hear from god
[51:16] and he's come to meet with you and you
[51:18] know what it doesn't matter whatever
[51:19] your problem is whatever he's already
[51:22] got the answer for it he's already got
[51:24] your answer before you even call he said
[51:27] i would have the answer he said i would
[51:29] answer
[51:34] so you know
[51:35] we if we if we this reason that we have
[51:37] to get into this heavenly atmosphere and
[51:39] allow the devil the lord to break this
[51:42] spell that the devil has on us to cast
[51:45] him out why because then we can get in
[51:46] the atmosphere of the holy spirit and he
[51:49] begins to speak to us and he begins to
[51:52] move
[51:54] and it's like well it's not just another
[51:56] service no no it's the time that all of
[51:59] a sudden the heavens open up and the
[52:01] glory fills the building and everybody
[52:04] has what they have need of but he said
[52:06] he said do you come in here he said but
[52:08] if you're prayed up and i'm prayed up he
[52:10] said then we can hear from heaven
[52:15] but you know what we don't see that as
[52:17] an act of worship
[52:20] we don't see that as worshiping god it's
[52:22] like we're going to come in here and
[52:23] clap our hands no when we prepare
[52:25] ourselves when we listen to the right
[52:27] things and we feed on the right things
[52:28] all week long
[52:30] amen when we prepare ourselves
[52:34] and it's not just the fivefold ministry
[52:36] that's to prepare ourselves but it's for
[52:38] every one of us to prepare ourselves for
[52:40] church to come into this place and you
[52:43] know and it's just like you know it's
[52:44] it's
[52:45] when we it's not just a a ritual
[52:51] but it's a life live
[52:56] if we can step into that heavenly
[52:57] atmosphere and have the heavenly sinning
[53:00] in heavenly places
[53:02] to know what god will
[53:04] what god can pour out his
[53:07] his
[53:08] blessings on us
[53:10] amen
[53:11] brother brahman said did you ever sit in
[53:13] one he said oh i've set till i would
[53:15] weep for joy and say god never let me
[53:18] leave here just heavenly places in
[53:20] christ jesus
[53:23] you know you get in you get into the
[53:24] atmosphere of the holy spirit sometimes
[53:26] it's like i don't want to leave amen
[53:30] and you know what this is what it's
[53:31] going to be like when we get out of here
[53:34] amen
[53:35] when we tell you when we when we get
[53:37] raptured out of here that's where it's
[53:38] going to be every single day
[53:40] all the former things are going to be
[53:42] passed away
[53:56] but an act of worship
[53:58] an act of worship is the things that you
[54:00] would do
[54:02] not
[54:03] that
[54:04] as as a definition
[54:06] what you would do
[54:08] to show your homage to your adoration
[54:11] identifying who this person is
[54:16] brother branham said in in god's gifts
[54:18] always find their places he he was
[54:20] speaking of the wise man he said that
[54:21] the wise
[54:22] men are clearly identified that they are
[54:26] offering their gift to him showing that
[54:28] in their heart they knew who he was and
[54:30] what he was going to do for them
[54:33] so no wonder the first thing they did
[54:35] they fell down perfectly in order and
[54:37] worshiped him before they could even
[54:39] understand it they fell down and
[54:41] worshipped him and then presented their
[54:42] gifts
[54:44] he said that's the way we have real
[54:45] christmas worship him then present your
[54:48] gift presenting your body as a living
[54:51] sacrifice holy and acceptable
[54:54] to god
[54:56] and he says he said
[54:58] after the wise
[54:59] but do you see
[55:00] what after the wise men did that
[55:03] and he's talking about mary and joseph
[55:06] he said
[55:07] but we find out they that they accepted
[55:09] the gifts from these wise men no wonder
[55:11] they were called wise men they were wise
[55:14] they really had wisdom if if men today
[55:16] would just be that wise just as wise it
[55:19] takes a wise man to come to christ the
[55:21] man that turns away from him is uh is an
[55:24] unwise man but it takes a wise man to
[55:26] come to christ
[55:29] so they their act of worship
[55:32] was not just coming and and bowing down
[55:34] before him but their act of worship was
[55:37] that they brought what he was
[55:39] identifying who he was because they
[55:41] identified the value in him they
[55:44] identified who he was so when they
[55:45] brought their gifts and testified
[55:48] who they who they said he was
[55:51] and so you know brother and said that
[55:52] they were wise because they saw and
[55:54] understood that and knew what he would
[55:55] do for them
[55:58] now in in the uh in the middle ages and
[56:01] in our in in the world many times in
[56:04] europe we find out that uh you know they
[56:06] had the feudal system
[56:08] and some of y'all probably know what
[56:10] that is and and for those that don't
[56:12] know that's not the hatfields and mccoys
[56:16] but but in a feudal system is when you
[56:19] have a a landowner who owned a large
[56:22] portion and he had a castle and and then
[56:25] he would give out so much to those that
[56:27] were around him
[56:30] but when they had they had a man that
[56:32] was called the word is called a vassal
[56:34] vassal is the is the name of the word
[56:36] and it's a man that has authority but he
[56:38] doesn't have the the authority
[56:41] that that the landowner did but he had
[56:44] people under him and he had certain
[56:46] things
[56:47] but one of the things that this man done
[56:49] was when he went and he always wanted to
[56:52] make sure that he made his allegiance
[56:54] and he and he gave his honor
[56:57] because one of the definitions is to
[56:59] recognize someone that's a superior to
[57:02] you
[57:02] and this man he would always know the
[57:05] landowner and always want to honor him
[57:07] and show respect to him that who he was
[57:11] and he said through that the man was
[57:13] given favor
[57:14] amen
[57:16] so here's a man that has this man that
[57:18] has all of his vast wealth and all of
[57:20] this land but you know he would come and
[57:22] he would swear his allegiance to this
[57:24] man and he would honor this man and with
[57:26] through that this man was given uh favor
[57:29] through through this man and then he
[57:30] would be he would be given those things
[57:32] that he had need of he would be blessed
[57:34] by lands and all these other things so
[57:36] then if he had a small portion then all
[57:39] of a sudden he had a greater portion
[57:40] because of his reverence to the man to
[57:43] this landowner in the in this system
[57:46] and then he would be blessed and then
[57:47] when this man would go out and he would
[57:49] do the right the right things and act
[57:51] correctly then that he would be even
[57:54] even blessed more because of the way he
[57:56] conducted himself
[58:00] and so when we see these people that
[58:01] that when they recognize somebody
[58:04] and he recognized who this who this man
[58:06] was and that he had power to to do
[58:10] things for him and he honored him not
[58:12] just not just with his mouth
[58:15] but he honored him through his actions
[58:20] and in the scripture we find a man that
[58:22] does just that to jesus
[58:26] we know that the centurion and and in
[58:28] the book of matthew you know he he came
[58:31] to
[58:31] jesus and and he spoke to jesus and he
[58:34] honored jesus because he knew who he was
[58:37] and what he could do
[58:38] and he said lord he said come and touch
[58:41] my
[58:42] servant because he's very sick
[58:46] and jesus was i was was moved by the way
[58:48] this man conducted himself and how he
[58:50] honored jesus and he said he said i will
[58:53] come to your house
[58:55] and i will heal your servant
[58:58] but you know what this man had the same
[59:01] reverence as that vassal did in the
[59:03] feudal system and he came and he told
[59:06] him he said he said lord
[59:08] he said he said i'm not worthy for you
[59:09] to come to my house
[59:12] he said he said lord i'm a man of
[59:14] authority
[59:15] and he said i have servants i have
[59:17] soldiers and he said i tell them to go
[59:19] and they go they'll come and they come
[59:21] he said my servant he said i tell him to
[59:23] do certain things and he does it
[59:27] but he said he said lord i see who you
[59:29] are and i see the power and authority
[59:32] that you have he said i'm not worthy for
[59:34] you to come to my house but he said i
[59:35] know who you are he said if you just
[59:37] speak the word
[59:39] he said my servant will be healed and
[59:41] you won't even have to come
[59:44] and jesus was so moved by this man's
[59:46] faith he said i'm not seeing faith like
[59:48] this in israel
[59:50] i'm so amazed by this man's uh faith
[59:53] but but look at the honor look at and
[59:55] and
[59:56] this being an act of worship to jesus
[59:59] that he brought up before him and said
[1:00:01] lord he said you don't have to do that
[1:00:02] just speak the word
[1:00:05] and that's what he did and jesus was so
[1:00:08] moved by his by his actions
[1:00:11] and it was an act of worship to him he
[1:00:12] said your servant's healed
[1:00:15] and that's all he had to say and he said
[1:00:17] from that same hour that he was healed
[1:00:20] he didn't have he didn't have to come
[1:00:22] and speak to him but he was already
[1:00:24] healed
[1:00:26] just by his act of worship
[1:00:38] brother brahm said in the message
[1:00:41] that day on calvary
[1:00:44] he said forgive me my pentecostal
[1:00:46] friends i am pentecostal but my
[1:00:48] pentecostal friends has got to a spot
[1:00:50] where there has to be a lot of fast
[1:00:52] music
[1:00:53] beating up some bands or clapping hands
[1:00:55] or tambourine to bring up a shout
[1:00:58] he said that's only emotions
[1:01:01] they play the bands before they go to
[1:01:03] battle to get people in the emotion of
[1:01:05] battle
[1:01:06] he said i believe in music i believe in
[1:01:08] cal happen of hands but i believe in
[1:01:10] these
[1:01:11] but i believe in these things that's
[1:01:12] exactly true
[1:01:15] we ought to have that
[1:01:17] but you have left the great things
[1:01:18] undone
[1:01:20] he said is that self-sacrifice life that
[1:01:23] god gives in you automatically doing
[1:01:26] that which is right because it's right
[1:01:28] just going on don't even think nothing
[1:01:31] about it just living it then what you
[1:01:33] just
[1:01:34] you see what's going on
[1:01:36] you don't
[1:01:38] you're on the highway
[1:01:40] that's what calvary meant to you
[1:01:42] on the highway open up that day for you
[1:01:50] you know there's many people that you
[1:01:51] know you know and and and i like i like
[1:01:54] i like fast music and and i like
[1:01:56] wonderful worship and all these type
[1:01:58] things but you know you know as
[1:02:00] when we're speaking of worship you know
[1:02:02] like brother branham was speaking here
[1:02:03] you know you know pentecost they made it
[1:02:05] all about the the church and this and
[1:02:08] the emotions and everything like that
[1:02:09] but you know when he turns it around he
[1:02:11] says he said the thing that has to be
[1:02:13] done the thing that you've left undone
[1:02:15] is living a life
[1:02:17] he's living a self-sacrifice life
[1:02:21] we can have worship we have a great
[1:02:22] worship but the greatest worship that if
[1:02:24] you want to worship god you want to
[1:02:26] honor god is the best thing that you can
[1:02:28] do is live the life kind of life to live
[1:02:30] the life of of jesus christ
[1:02:33] i like to honor jesus christ
[1:02:36] where he has the preeminence
[1:02:40] where he's he's the one that's honored
[1:02:44] but
[1:02:46] brother branagh was speaking
[1:02:49] when he was
[1:02:50] when he was speaking of the of the
[1:02:53] pharisees and and the sadducees and the
[1:02:55] scribes when they when they lived there
[1:02:57] you know when they went about their
[1:02:59] their business
[1:03:00] and he was talking about how how smart
[1:03:02] they were and how how brilliant and the
[1:03:05] uh ecclesiastical and all these things
[1:03:07] how they how they lived their lives and
[1:03:09] all these things but he said you know he
[1:03:11] said they had turned the commandments of
[1:03:13] god in in in traditions and he said he
[1:03:16] said you you've made them of none effect
[1:03:20] and he said you know then when when he
[1:03:23] was speaking of the life that they had
[1:03:24] lived
[1:03:27] you know it's the right kind of life
[1:03:29] because when he was speaking of them
[1:03:31] you know the the life that the scribes
[1:03:34] and the pharisees live he said you know
[1:03:36] you could trace it back generations and
[1:03:38] and all of their
[1:03:40] great-great-great-grandfathers or
[1:03:41] whatever all of them had you couldn't
[1:03:42] put a finger on their life
[1:03:45] all the things that they had done all
[1:03:46] the way through
[1:03:48] you know you could you couldn't argue
[1:03:50] with what they had done
[1:03:52] but the problem is is when when the one
[1:03:54] thing that they had to hold on to was
[1:03:56] the word was the law and when it came
[1:03:58] through it there was only one way that
[1:04:01] the word would be manifest and and
[1:04:03] brought and uh revealed
[1:04:06] was by the prophets
[1:04:09] but they had gotten away from all that
[1:04:11] and you know then they they had to well
[1:04:13] we have to find out who's in who's in
[1:04:15] charge and well you know rabbi so and so
[1:04:17] says this and this one says that and you
[1:04:19] know then it all became so muddled up
[1:04:21] that nobody knows exactly what to
[1:04:23] believe and then there's like well we're
[1:04:25] going to have these um
[1:04:27] well rabbi so-and-so says these things
[1:04:29] and you know then all of a sudden
[1:04:32] we prescribe to these things
[1:04:34] and then all of a sudden then it becomes
[1:04:36] this is more important
[1:04:39] then then what the law said
[1:04:43] and then and then we see people that
[1:04:44] that have come and he says brother brahm
[1:04:46] says
[1:04:48] he said they didn't know what to believe
[1:04:50] he said believe me it's the same thing
[1:04:52] again it's repeated itself
[1:04:56] so the same thing that they done back
[1:04:58] then is the same is the same thing that
[1:05:00] is today
[1:05:05] you know many times we have people
[1:05:06] that and we understand that
[1:05:09] and the day that an hour which we live
[1:05:11] this is this is the things that we're
[1:05:12] supposed to take place
[1:05:15] well because we know that there's going
[1:05:16] to be a falling away
[1:05:19] but you know what it's go it's a shaking
[1:05:21] time but you know what the ones that
[1:05:23] that can be shaken are going to be
[1:05:25] shaken
[1:05:26] but you know what the ones that cannot
[1:05:27] be shaken cannot be shaken
[1:05:30] but we see this you know this
[1:05:32] where
[1:05:33] we have
[1:05:34] people and you know there's there's so
[1:05:37] many people that you know they they they
[1:05:39] think that that it has to be a certain
[1:05:41] uh person a certain personality a
[1:05:44] certain a certain church
[1:05:47] you know everybody thinks well you know
[1:05:49] though you know if you go to brother
[1:05:51] so-and-so's church you know those are
[1:05:52] the people that's going to make the
[1:05:53] rapture
[1:05:55] you know it's just like you know you
[1:05:57] know i you know i we're we're living in
[1:05:59] we're living in in the greatest time
[1:06:02] because we're going by the so-and-so's
[1:06:03] church
[1:06:05] and when people get up there and they
[1:06:06] say you know if if brother branham was
[1:06:09] alive today he'd be sitting in our
[1:06:10] church listening to our pastor
[1:06:16] and you know they they become so
[1:06:18] arrogant and and it becomes such a such
[1:06:20] a uh
[1:06:21] a rebuke
[1:06:23] the way people are the way people draw
[1:06:25] and it's like no no we're not we're not
[1:06:27] trying to look for man
[1:06:29] it's not looking at a man it's not
[1:06:30] looking at a ministry it's looking at
[1:06:32] christ
[1:06:34] so when so it's not it's not just one
[1:06:36] person
[1:06:39] but it's christ
[1:06:41] when and we get to when people get to
[1:06:43] the place where they can't see christ in
[1:06:45] every and every brother and sister
[1:06:48] and it's not and it's and there's more
[1:06:49] emphasis on this one than that one
[1:06:54] you know the problem is is we we get so
[1:06:56] people get so wrapped up and it's like
[1:06:57] well you know i can't go to i can't go
[1:06:59] to a little church
[1:07:03] you know then they start looking well
[1:07:04] you know
[1:07:05] they got 200 people in their church i
[1:07:07] might be able to go there
[1:07:11] oh yeah
[1:07:12] and it's not and it's not like going and
[1:07:15] sitting and listening you know where do
[1:07:16] i get fed
[1:07:20] where where where where is it the word
[1:07:22] being preached
[1:07:24] you know all of a sudden then it seems
[1:07:26] like you know i you know i can i see
[1:07:28] something there that i don't see
[1:07:30] anywhere else
[1:07:31] that's right and you know not ever not
[1:07:34] every place is everybody's cup of tea i
[1:07:36] understand that
[1:07:38] even brother branham stood up one day
[1:07:39] and when they were asking him questions
[1:07:41] and answers and he said he said i'm not
[1:07:42] the only pebble on the beach
[1:07:47] but when we get to the place where you
[1:07:49] know everybody starts to look at the
[1:07:50] external things instead of looking at
[1:07:52] the eternal things when they start to
[1:07:54] begin to look at things that have no
[1:07:56] that have no business in the in the plan
[1:07:58] of god in the house of god and that's
[1:08:00] what they get so wrapped up in
[1:08:06] then we begin then brother brown says he
[1:08:08] said the gospel sounds in the purity of
[1:08:10] its word and its manifestation and he
[1:08:12] said they still don't get it
[1:08:15] so when the word has went forth they
[1:08:16] miss it why because they're looking at
[1:08:18] things that have no place
[1:08:23] you know it's like well you know what i
[1:08:24] could go i wouldn't go to that church
[1:08:26] because their music is not just
[1:08:31] well you know what that doesn't that
[1:08:33] doesn't change anything
[1:08:36] it's like boy i love this church we pull
[1:08:37] up in the parking lot we hear the music
[1:08:41] it's like we you know we just come in
[1:08:43] and almost have to pass out earplugs to
[1:08:45] everybody so everybody can have come in
[1:08:47] church and worship
[1:08:50] and i'm not knocking any anybody i mean
[1:08:53] if people like that that's fine but the
[1:08:55] problem is is when it comes down to the
[1:08:57] word
[1:08:58] what what is what is that what is the
[1:09:00] emphasis there
[1:09:03] you know when when as brother way just
[1:09:06] as mentioned before
[1:09:09] you know when you have when you have
[1:09:10] ministers and and you go to these
[1:09:12] ministers meeting and you talk to some
[1:09:14] of these brothers and you and you ask
[1:09:15] them and you know it's like you know
[1:09:17] certain brothers and it's so amazing
[1:09:19] they've not read certain books or they
[1:09:21] don't even own certain books of the
[1:09:22] prophet
[1:09:26] and it's like you know they they i i've
[1:09:29] been in this message 30 years
[1:09:31] and it's like well have you ever read
[1:09:33] the 70 weeks of daniel
[1:09:34] maybe once
[1:09:37] you know and there's so many things that
[1:09:38] people people they don't even know
[1:09:40] simple things
[1:09:42] i like like brother matthew bray says
[1:09:44] you know have you been in the message at
[1:09:46] least two weeks he said well then you
[1:09:48] can understand this
[1:09:50] well some people you've been in it for
[1:09:51] 30 years and they still can't understand
[1:09:53] it
[1:09:55] and it's what why is it because they
[1:09:57] don't study they don't look into the
[1:09:58] word of god they've not read the word of
[1:10:00] god so when it when they don't look into
[1:10:03] it and it's not studied and it's not an
[1:10:04] emphasis
[1:10:07] then that all we do is come to church
[1:10:09] and all this is hair and dress and and
[1:10:11] all these things and you know we try to
[1:10:13] figure out you know whether whether our
[1:10:14] young people can go this place or that
[1:10:16] place or play ball or play volleyball or
[1:10:18] whatever
[1:10:21] people put so many emphasis on those
[1:10:23] things
[1:10:25] well i don't know i don't know if you'll
[1:10:26] make it and i don't know if you're going
[1:10:28] to make it in the rapture brother i
[1:10:29] heard your kids watch cartoons
[1:10:37] i mean you think it's silly but i mean
[1:10:39] people get so wrapped up on things like
[1:10:40] that i mean what is it
[1:10:43] i mean it's so it's so silly
[1:10:45] but that's what that's what they hold on
[1:10:47] to
[1:10:48] and what is that what what is those
[1:10:50] things it's tradition
[1:10:53] well because many times it's the same
[1:10:55] thing that mama told his grandma taught
[1:10:57] him great grandma taught him it's the
[1:10:58] same thing
[1:11:02] we're we're holier than y'all because we
[1:11:05] don't do those things
[1:11:10] well you know what you work out your own
[1:11:12] salvation with fear and trembling
[1:11:15] but some people they they who praise the
[1:11:17] lord
[1:11:18] i don't put up a christmas tree
[1:11:22] and and and you know and i've heard
[1:11:25] people stand up and say if you put up a
[1:11:26] christmas tree you identify yourself to
[1:11:28] the whole world as a heathen
[1:11:30] i was like well brother branham
[1:11:32] identified himself to the whole world as
[1:11:33] a heathen
[1:11:38] and then everybody gets upset
[1:11:41] i was like well you know that's that's
[1:11:43] the rule that you said
[1:11:45] that's the standard you put out there
[1:11:50] then that's the standard
[1:11:53] oh no brother branham is different
[1:11:57] no say it's another it's another
[1:11:59] tradition that people have
[1:12:05] because you know
[1:12:06] you know when you when you look at
[1:12:07] brother branham's life people people
[1:12:09] want to put all this you know brother
[1:12:10] branham was so great and he was he you
[1:12:12] know we we honor the the prophet we
[1:12:14] honor the office that he had but you
[1:12:16] know he was still a man
[1:12:18] and he still lived he still lived a life
[1:12:21] and he still had faults
[1:12:23] and he still sinned
[1:12:27] but that didn't change what he done
[1:12:30] they did not change the message that he
[1:12:32] brought
[1:12:33] that was still an office that god used
[1:12:35] and he still spoke through the man
[1:12:40] but that didn't that didn't change any
[1:12:41] of that
[1:12:47] but you know i've heard people talk
[1:12:48] about you know when you when you begin
[1:12:50] to look at these things and and you and
[1:12:52] you see that the kind of
[1:12:55] uh
[1:12:57] you know they they try to put brother
[1:12:58] branham out ahead of everybody else and
[1:13:00] he's greater than everybody else and and
[1:13:02] you know and then they come in there
[1:13:04] well brother branham could do things and
[1:13:06] you know because he was a prophet and
[1:13:08] all these things he's like listen
[1:13:10] he had he had to be saved just like you
[1:13:12] and i had to be saved
[1:13:15] he still he still had to repent just
[1:13:17] like the rest of us had to repent
[1:13:20] now everybody puts that he was on he was
[1:13:22] on a fast track with the lord and that
[1:13:24] he didn't have to do the things that the
[1:13:26] rest of us have to do
[1:13:30] and i thought well you know what i said
[1:13:32] when was the last time any of y'all ever
[1:13:33] stayed eight hours or longer praying
[1:13:36] because you told a half a lie
[1:13:41] when he went when he told the people
[1:13:43] that he wasn't home on the tax case and
[1:13:45] he ran out the door and he told sister
[1:13:46] me to tell him i'm not home
[1:13:50] and then he went out the door and he
[1:13:51] went to pray for that baby and the lord
[1:13:53] tell him why are you putting your hands
[1:13:54] on him
[1:13:55] why you put your hands on that baby
[1:13:58] and he come back and told him said
[1:13:59] listen i can't pray for your child right
[1:14:00] now he said i got to go do something
[1:14:04] and then he went he didn't he didn't run
[1:14:05] up to green's mill and just hang out for
[1:14:06] a little bit and get on his knees and
[1:14:08] say lord you know i'm sorry and jump up
[1:14:10] and take off
[1:14:14] but you know he went up there and prayed
[1:14:15] through
[1:14:18] before he came back to play his hands on
[1:14:20] that baby
[1:14:23] i said when was the last time you done
[1:14:24] that amen
[1:14:27] and everybody thinks that you know
[1:14:30] brother branham had greasy grace
[1:14:33] many times when we began to look at the
[1:14:35] well actually when you begin to look at
[1:14:36] the life of the prophets you know what
[1:14:38] there was a higher standard that he
[1:14:39] lived by
[1:14:44] and because he lived the kind of life
[1:14:46] that he did then god honored him and was
[1:14:48] able to do the things that he was able
[1:14:50] to do
[1:14:52] and you know sometimes when we when we
[1:14:54] begin to look at things you know well
[1:14:56] that's that's one of the problems that
[1:14:57] we have in our lives is because we allow
[1:14:59] things to get slack we get likes about
[1:15:02] things
[1:15:04] when we give when we give place to the
[1:15:05] devil
[1:15:07] and then when these things happen then
[1:15:09] we wonder why things have come to the
[1:15:10] way that they have
[1:15:13] when people wonder about they well lord
[1:15:15] i've got cold in the spirit well what is
[1:15:17] the problem
[1:15:18] the lord didn't move
[1:15:22] that's right
[1:15:23] you know like brother ram said and be
[1:15:24] certain of god you know when you come to
[1:15:26] these things he said you know then you
[1:15:27] just go back through everything and you
[1:15:29] stay there
[1:15:30] and you keep going back through
[1:15:32] everything
[1:15:35] but you know sometimes we say you know
[1:15:36] we don't have time for that
[1:15:40] but you know that's what some people
[1:15:42] that's what we need we need to go back
[1:15:43] and get down and stay before god until
[1:15:45] we get an answer
[1:15:48] amen and find out what exactly is the
[1:15:50] problem
[1:15:53] just like when the children of israel
[1:15:54] you know when there was death in the
[1:15:55] camp then it's like hey it's time joshua
[1:15:57] hey time to hold up
[1:15:59] we're going to stop right here
[1:16:01] we're going to start waiting this thing
[1:16:03] out
[1:16:05] we're gonna start bringing all the
[1:16:06] tribes by and all the families and we're
[1:16:08] gonna start weeding this thing out till
[1:16:10] we figure out who's who's at fault
[1:16:14] but many times people don't want that
[1:16:16] kind of preaching
[1:16:17] why because it puts too much pressure on
[1:16:20] but you know that's what the scripture
[1:16:22] tells us in the last days that's where
[1:16:23] it's going to be that's what the word is
[1:16:25] to do
[1:16:27] and so you know you're going to have
[1:16:28] you're going to have to come to church
[1:16:29] you're either going to get better or
[1:16:31] you're going to get leave worse
[1:16:33] you're either going to draw closer to
[1:16:34] god or you're going to be further away
[1:16:36] from god
[1:16:37] but you're going to have to make you're
[1:16:38] going to have to make that decision
[1:16:42] you're going to have to come to that
[1:16:43] place
[1:16:56] here in the in the scripture
[1:16:59] we begin to look at the the scripture
[1:17:01] that that came and
[1:17:04] as as we were speaking before
[1:17:07] you know the they were
[1:17:09] the old testament
[1:17:11] when when they began to look and and the
[1:17:13] prophecies had been to go begin to go
[1:17:15] forth
[1:17:16] the prophets began to speak and and you
[1:17:19] know they began to look forward to to
[1:17:20] these prophecies
[1:17:23] and as we were speaking before you know
[1:17:24] it was the prophets that came later that
[1:17:27] pointed them back to the prophecies that
[1:17:30] came and even even when jesus came and
[1:17:32] he began to minister then he began to
[1:17:34] turn the people back and say look there
[1:17:36] isn't that's what the prophet said and
[1:17:38] the psalms
[1:17:40] and as and as you know
[1:17:42] daniel was talking about he said i
[1:17:44] understood my books
[1:17:47] and he began to look back to see what
[1:17:48] jeremiah had to say
[1:17:51] because brotherhood said a true prophet
[1:17:53] when he came he would look back to see
[1:17:55] what the previous prophets had said
[1:17:58] so he knew what was prophesied ahead of
[1:18:00] time so when he began to speak he knew
[1:18:02] if he was right or not because his
[1:18:03] message he knew his message had to line
[1:18:06] up with the previous message
[1:18:08] there was no there was no deviation
[1:18:12] just like just like when uh jeremiah and
[1:18:15] the different ones you know when when
[1:18:16] they had other prophets that would come
[1:18:17] and prophesy wrong and they would you
[1:18:19] know then he would turn them back and
[1:18:21] say well let's look and see what they
[1:18:22] said what was previously spoke of
[1:18:27] and so in the scripture we see a lot of
[1:18:30] a lot of these scriptures that they
[1:18:31] begin to point back
[1:18:33] and you know then they begin to look at
[1:18:35] these things and people not seeing
[1:18:38] what we call it but you didn't have the
[1:18:40] eye salve if you didn't have you had to
[1:18:42] have a seer to point you back to that
[1:18:45] and you know in in the scripture
[1:18:49] in matthew chapter 2 verse 23
[1:18:52] and you're speaking of jesus and and his
[1:18:54] life
[1:18:55] and you know that that was one of the
[1:18:57] questions that the the pharisees and the
[1:18:59] scribes in them had was when they began
[1:19:01] to look back at jesus's life
[1:19:04] they began to look to find out what the
[1:19:05] prophets had previously spoken
[1:19:08] and it's like when was he in egypt
[1:19:12] you know and the scripture tells us here
[1:19:14] he says and he came and dwelt in the
[1:19:16] city of nazareth that it might be
[1:19:18] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[1:19:20] prophets he shall be called a nazarene
[1:19:24] now this is one question that people
[1:19:26] that they have it says the prophet said
[1:19:28] that he would be called a nazarene well
[1:19:30] then they go back to the old testament
[1:19:31] and they all stood you know calling the
[1:19:33] scripture trying to find where is this
[1:19:36] in the old testament
[1:19:39] and it's like well we can't find that
[1:19:43] but in but in isaiah 11 1 says
[1:19:47] and there shall come forth a rod out of
[1:19:49] the house of the stem of jesse a branch
[1:19:51] which shall be
[1:19:53] shall grow out of his roots
[1:19:55] so he begins to speak of of the house of
[1:19:58] jesse and the and the branch that's
[1:20:00] coming there would be a springing forth
[1:20:05] now
[1:20:06] you know people people look at this and
[1:20:07] they say well when you look at the word
[1:20:10] the branch
[1:20:12] it means though that the actual word is
[1:20:14] netster netzer
[1:20:17] but when you look at that then they say
[1:20:18] that that applies to nazareth because of
[1:20:21] the of the names and the way they they
[1:20:23] were connected and they say well we
[1:20:25] don't we don't see it that way and some
[1:20:27] say well that's what they say this this
[1:20:29] scripture is speaking when you look
[1:20:32] because when they look back at this this
[1:20:33] is they say well this is speaking of him
[1:20:36] being coming from nazareth
[1:20:38] and then a lot of people say well
[1:20:40] i don't see it that way and then they
[1:20:42] want to argue over whether it matches up
[1:20:44] or not
[1:20:46] and and it's like well you know let me
[1:20:48] tell you something
[1:20:49] the scripture says that he said he would
[1:20:51] become that he would be a nazarene the
[1:20:53] scripture says the prophet said that and
[1:20:56] he come from nazareth
[1:20:59] and he was a nazarene so whether whether
[1:21:01] or not that scripture refers to that or
[1:21:03] not that's not that's not the issue the
[1:21:05] scripture tells us that he did come from
[1:21:07] nazareth and that he was a nazarene
[1:21:11] and so you know then whether you argue
[1:21:13] over the this point whether it matches
[1:21:15] up or not that's that's irrelevant
[1:21:17] because the scripture says that he would
[1:21:20] and we know we know that not every
[1:21:22] prophecy was written in the scripture
[1:21:26] and so we you know we don't know where
[1:21:28] it was written but you know i i honestly
[1:21:31] believe that somebody spoke it
[1:21:34] it had to be spoken somewhere and
[1:21:35] somebody knew about it
[1:21:39] and it was spoken and then when when the
[1:21:41] writers came when matthew and them came
[1:21:43] in there and they began to speak of that
[1:21:44] you know what they weren't confused on
[1:21:46] that
[1:21:48] that wasn't that wasn't just some kind
[1:21:49] of hidden hocus pocus or something that
[1:21:51] was thus saith the lord
[1:21:55] so you know that's all that's all i got
[1:21:57] that's all i got to believe it was
[1:21:58] spoken and it come to pass
[1:22:01] whether we're going to split hairs over
[1:22:03] it or or not that's not that's very
[1:22:05] irrelevant
[1:22:08] and many times people have taken the
[1:22:10] scripture and that and that's that's
[1:22:11] where they want to put their emphasis on
[1:22:13] these things he's like well you know
[1:22:14] brother madam said this here and brother
[1:22:16] madam said that there and they spent all
[1:22:18] their time trying to split hairs and
[1:22:20] argue over one thing and another
[1:22:24] and it's like well let me let me tell
[1:22:25] you well have you sat down and prayed
[1:22:27] about it
[1:22:28] have you read have you allowed the lord
[1:22:30] to speak to you about it
[1:22:35] and we realized you know as as brother
[1:22:37] uh aaron mcgeary was talking about one
[1:22:39] time he said you know the one of the
[1:22:40] problems that people have in this
[1:22:42] message is is they think we have to
[1:22:43] become apologetics
[1:22:46] we're not you know because you know
[1:22:48] we're not going to know we're not going
[1:22:49] to be able to dot every eye and cross
[1:22:51] every t because if you get to the point
[1:22:53] where you can answer every question and
[1:22:55] there's no kind of
[1:22:57] hiccups and there are those kind of
[1:22:58] things that just stand out that don't
[1:23:01] match up and you have questions and
[1:23:02] everything like that he said you can't
[1:23:04] have faith but it takes faith to take
[1:23:07] god at his word and say you know this is
[1:23:09] just what he said
[1:23:12] i'm just going to believe what he said
[1:23:20] i don't i'm not i'm not here to argue
[1:23:22] over the points or or whatever i know
[1:23:24] what god showed of me
[1:23:26] i know what god revealed to me and and
[1:23:28] you know you you may not see that and
[1:23:30] that's okay
[1:23:33] but i know what god showed me
[1:23:35] what god's revealed to me and i you know
[1:23:37] and maybe you don't see that that's okay
[1:23:42] brother brown said one time he said it
[1:23:43] would be it would be a special class of
[1:23:45] people that would understand this it
[1:23:47] would be people that had supernatural
[1:23:49] understanding
[1:23:51] you know it's not it's not for the world
[1:23:57] it's not it's not for the whole world to
[1:23:58] see these things
[1:24:01] this is from uh greater than solomon is
[1:24:03] here and brethren says and and believe
[1:24:05] now he said now jesus was rebuking that
[1:24:07] generation generation for not believing
[1:24:09] his sign that he was that he was had
[1:24:11] proved to them that he was the messiah
[1:24:14] no
[1:24:15] no you know we took that last night how
[1:24:16] he was the messiah because he was the
[1:24:18] word is that right messiah means to
[1:24:19] christ the anointed one and then he was
[1:24:22] to be the king god the god prophet and
[1:24:24] there was the spirit in him and here was
[1:24:27] a spirit in him now remember the ones
[1:24:29] who really stayed with the scripture
[1:24:31] teaching they recognized him but those
[1:24:34] who went off
[1:24:36] the other
[1:24:37] with the other church in their
[1:24:39] traditions they missed it see
[1:24:41] and jesus told those teachers he said
[1:24:43] you with your traditions you take the
[1:24:44] commandments of god and make them of
[1:24:46] none effect
[1:24:48] now though what would they do with their
[1:24:50] tradition today saying the days of
[1:24:51] miracles has passed that's a tradition
[1:24:54] there's no such thing as divine healing
[1:24:56] that's tradition
[1:24:57] that's not the bible i can show you
[1:25:00] i can show any man where jesus ordained
[1:25:02] his church and commissioned
[1:25:04] it to all the world
[1:25:06] to every creature and these signs shall
[1:25:08] follow them that believe
[1:25:10] now i want somebody to show me a spot of
[1:25:12] scripture where he taken it away from
[1:25:15] the church he said it's not there it's
[1:25:17] still in the church it's the traditions
[1:25:19] that's twisted it out
[1:25:22] and he said that's the reason they did
[1:25:24] not they didn't recognize jesus
[1:25:27] so when you when you began to take these
[1:25:29] things see he began to expound to them
[1:25:32] who he was
[1:25:33] and he began to open up the scripture to
[1:25:35] them
[1:25:36] and he began to make it known but you
[1:25:38] know they had to receive that
[1:25:40] and he said they couldn't because they
[1:25:42] were so tied up in their traditions they
[1:25:44] didn't see who he was and they couldn't
[1:25:45] put their finger on who he was they
[1:25:48] couldn't they couldn't line it all up
[1:25:51] when he began to speak to the 70 and
[1:25:53] peter come to him you know and p and
[1:25:56] jesus told him said are you going to
[1:25:57] leave also
[1:26:00] and you know peter still had questions
[1:26:02] peter still had doubts he was still
[1:26:03] trying to work everything out but you
[1:26:05] know what he had a revelation
[1:26:08] he said thou art the christ the son of
[1:26:10] the living god he said and jesus said he
[1:26:13] said blessed art thou
[1:26:14] simon bar jonah he said of course flesh
[1:26:17] and blood didn't reveal that to you
[1:26:20] now that didn't change all the other
[1:26:21] problems that peter had in his life
[1:26:24] that didn't change it he was still he
[1:26:26] still had a he was still a man but still
[1:26:28] had a temper
[1:26:31] he still had faults and failures but you
[1:26:32] know what he had a revelation
[1:26:35] and he said lord whom
[1:26:36] to whom shall we go
[1:26:40] thou hast the words of eternal life
[1:26:43] amen lord where are we going to go
[1:26:46] amen
[1:26:47] we're walking in all that we see and we
[1:26:49] and we may not have all the answers and
[1:26:51] but we know might see everything but you
[1:26:53] know what we're walking and what we see
[1:26:56] and that's what we begin to do we begin
[1:26:57] to see these things and they begin to
[1:26:59] talk about you know the traditions
[1:27:04] that everybody had
[1:27:06] and the ideas that they'd been taught
[1:27:10] but you know they had to override those
[1:27:12] things
[1:27:15] oh you know you and i we we still have
[1:27:17] questions we may still have doubts about
[1:27:19] things
[1:27:21] you know we all still have terminals
[1:27:22] about things
[1:27:24] why because you're still in a battle
[1:27:28] but you know if if god has showed you
[1:27:30] one thing if god has brought you this
[1:27:32] far that he's going to continue on he's
[1:27:34] going to continue to carry you on
[1:27:47] brother bram says and faith that was
[1:27:49] delivered to what's delivered to the
[1:27:50] saints
[1:27:52] and he was talking about
[1:27:54] he said you've taken your traditions and
[1:27:56] made them
[1:27:57] the commandments of god and none affect
[1:27:58] you but a bunch of snake in the grass he
[1:28:01] said now he said we can't stand that
[1:28:03] anybody goes to hear that stuff is that
[1:28:05] he said he can just take his church
[1:28:07] papers and walk away
[1:28:09] he said it hasn't changed a bit
[1:28:12] the seeds are coming right on
[1:28:15] trees
[1:28:16] going right on the same they didn't
[1:28:18] believe him but but why was he right and
[1:28:20] the rest of them was wrong god was with
[1:28:23] him and when after they crucified him in
[1:28:25] acts 2 4 acts 2 24 he said you men of
[1:28:29] israel
[1:28:30] said let it be known to you jesus of
[1:28:32] nazareth a man approved of god among you
[1:28:34] by signs and wonders and miracles which
[1:28:36] god did by him in the midst of you all
[1:28:39] that's how they know he was a man of god
[1:28:41] because god was with him performing
[1:28:43] signs and wonders
[1:28:45] he said they were sitting back saying
[1:28:46] the days of miracles has passed there's
[1:28:48] no such thing
[1:28:51] they didn't believe his his miracles but
[1:28:53] nicodemus come and told them said we
[1:28:55] know that you're a man of god because no
[1:28:57] nobody can do these things unless god be
[1:28:59] with him
[1:29:00] but they stood up and testified there
[1:29:02] was no there was no such thing as these
[1:29:04] things
[1:29:06] the guy's a
[1:29:07] a mind reader a fanatic
[1:29:09] there's nothing to him
[1:29:11] he don't even believe in our churches
[1:29:14] he don't belong to any of them thank god
[1:29:16] for that
[1:29:17] he stayed where god wanted him didn't
[1:29:19] make any difference he preached the word
[1:29:21] uncompromised he throwed like john the
[1:29:23] axe
[1:29:24] to the root of the tree let the chips
[1:29:26] fall where they wanted to what we need
[1:29:28] today is an old preacher like john the
[1:29:30] baptist amen
[1:29:33] but you know we see that today is when
[1:29:35] when the word goes forth you know then
[1:29:38] they say well we don't we don't believe
[1:29:40] those things and he said you know then
[1:29:42] they just take their papers and walk
[1:29:43] away well you can leave
[1:29:45] well that's what a lot of people do
[1:29:49] you got you got people that they want to
[1:29:51] claim to know so much and to be so
[1:29:53] revelated and have a certain place and
[1:29:55] they're and they run from pillar to post
[1:29:57] and they never sat under nobody any
[1:29:58] length of time and they never tried to
[1:30:00] learn anything but they want to tell you
[1:30:02] how to live your life
[1:30:07] you know and you see these people and
[1:30:08] they so wrapped up in trying to tell
[1:30:10] everybody how to live and how to do
[1:30:12] everything and it's like you know the
[1:30:13] bible has a name for that
[1:30:16] you know what that's called that's
[1:30:17] called a busybody
[1:30:22] and everybody's in everybody else's
[1:30:23] business
[1:30:25] you see these people jump up the first
[1:30:26] thing they do he's like
[1:30:28] well do you believe so-and-so has the
[1:30:29] holy ghost
[1:30:32] do you see the kind of life they live
[1:30:35] and it's like well let me tell you
[1:30:37] something
[1:30:38] brother sister
[1:30:39] the only thing i need to worry about is
[1:30:40] whether i got it or not
[1:30:44] and you need to worry about whether you
[1:30:46] got it or not
[1:30:51] you know brother they always talk about
[1:30:53] how the old pentecostals you know they
[1:30:54] always like to
[1:30:57] they're going to discern your spirit by
[1:30:58] looking at you an eye
[1:31:00] and they're going to look you and i will
[1:31:01] discern your spirit
[1:31:05] but you know they you know they get so
[1:31:07] wrapped up in all these things and you
[1:31:08] know
[1:31:09] and you you're so you know it's so
[1:31:12] and it's and it's like listen
[1:31:15] you need you need to worry about
[1:31:16] yourself
[1:31:18] you know the scripture is it's a very
[1:31:20] interesting thing i was i was looking
[1:31:22] and you know um
[1:31:25] in the in the scripture when i believe
[1:31:27] was paul when he was speaking of a
[1:31:29] busybody
[1:31:31] no i might be on on a tangent right now
[1:31:33] but that's all right i'll be back uh but
[1:31:35] you know he puts murder and
[1:31:37] and theft and all these other things in
[1:31:39] that same group
[1:31:45] and it's so amazing because do you know
[1:31:47] real and what's so amazing is you don't
[1:31:49] realize when you when you
[1:31:51] people are well i'm trying to help
[1:31:54] well you know what if you're not if
[1:31:55] you're not led of the holy ghost to do
[1:31:57] that
[1:31:59] you don't realize you can do more harm
[1:32:01] than good absolutely
[1:32:03] you're not you're not a you're not a
[1:32:04] help you're a hindrance
[1:32:08] you can be right in the way
[1:32:10] you know he didn't he didn't say you
[1:32:12] know uh
[1:32:13] busybody's in the same class as being
[1:32:15] getting mad or getting angry
[1:32:19] but you know he's a he you know when he
[1:32:21] when he lists these things he's like you
[1:32:22] know you don't need to murder
[1:32:24] people well you know and then he's like
[1:32:27] look you're destroying you know you're
[1:32:28] you're a fail you're a thief
[1:32:31] and don't be a busybody either
[1:32:35] one because you can do the exact same
[1:32:37] thing
[1:32:38] what you can you can murder some you can
[1:32:41] you can destroy somebody's influence
[1:32:43] you're you're a hindrance if you're
[1:32:44] still because you know you can take
[1:32:46] something from somebody
[1:32:49] you can be you can be more of a
[1:32:50] hindrance and hurt to somebody
[1:32:54] then you can be a help
[1:32:57] well i'm just i'm just trying to i'm
[1:32:59] just trying you know that's the reason
[1:33:01] that you know when when you speak
[1:33:03] then then the life that that you live
[1:33:06] you know it's you don't have to preach
[1:33:08] somebody a sermon live a sermon
[1:33:12] and it's like well you know i you know
[1:33:14] the lord told me to tell you this and
[1:33:17] the lord told me to tell you that and
[1:33:18] it's like well you know
[1:33:20] you know you see these people and it's
[1:33:22] like well you know it's like the lord
[1:33:24] told me to tell you this and the lord
[1:33:25] told me to tell you that it's like well
[1:33:26] let me tell you something the bible said
[1:33:29] and he said and then you meet these
[1:33:31] people and say well let me tell you what
[1:33:32] the bible says the bible says is that
[1:33:34] forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[1:33:36] together
[1:33:38] well why are you assembling
[1:33:42] the the prophet told us that you need to
[1:33:43] have a pastor and sit under them who's
[1:33:45] your pastor
[1:33:49] you know where do you where do you pay
[1:33:50] tithes
[1:33:54] so when we begin to look at you know
[1:33:56] we've got people's answers and people
[1:33:58] people want to share with you it's like
[1:34:00] well you know will you tell you tell me
[1:34:01] where you where the life that you live
[1:34:05] it's like well you know i would i would
[1:34:06] much rather just just hold my you know
[1:34:08] just hold my peace and wait for the lord
[1:34:10] to speak to me before i tell somebody
[1:34:12] something because i don't know if
[1:34:14] they're in the position to receive it
[1:34:19] but i would much rather i would much
[1:34:21] rather just wait until the whole you
[1:34:23] know the lord
[1:34:26] you know it's just like paul when paul
[1:34:27] was walking and it was on the the road
[1:34:32] and the and the girl with the spirit
[1:34:34] kept you know was walking behind them
[1:34:36] and kept identifying who they were
[1:34:39] well you know he didn't just turn around
[1:34:40] the first time that she said that and
[1:34:42] said and rebuked that thing
[1:34:44] but you know he he was long suffering
[1:34:46] and he began to walk with that for a
[1:34:48] while and then when the lord spoke to
[1:34:49] him then he could tell that thing to
[1:34:51] leave her
[1:34:53] and many times you know we need to come
[1:34:55] to the place where we can we can wait on
[1:34:56] the lord and have the lord speak to us
[1:34:58] that we and when we speak to somebody
[1:35:00] then then it's the right time
[1:35:03] you know there's many times that pastors
[1:35:05] have people say well well you know
[1:35:07] there's something going on in the church
[1:35:09] or you know something's happened or
[1:35:10] whatever and it's like well the pastor's
[1:35:11] not said anything about it you know it's
[1:35:13] like you know and i know times that
[1:35:15] people have said things about brother
[1:35:16] dale it's like well why hadn't brother
[1:35:18] dale said this why hadn't brother dale
[1:35:19] said that or or anything and it's like
[1:35:21] why because you know what he's me he's
[1:35:23] waiting on the lord
[1:35:26] he's like you know you're not you're not
[1:35:28] privy to the things that he is
[1:35:31] and when you when you become the pastor
[1:35:32] then you can make those decisions
[1:35:35] but when people come to those things and
[1:35:37] it's like listen he said i'm i'm not in
[1:35:39] that position
[1:35:41] so you know what i'm not trying to
[1:35:42] second-guess him
[1:35:46] he's like well i don't want to be in
[1:35:47] that position but the one thing that i
[1:35:49] can do is is pray
[1:35:52] and i can pray for him
[1:35:55] then it's like you know what lord hey
[1:35:57] you know i just i can do this this this
[1:35:59] is what i can do
[1:36:02] because if not then you become a
[1:36:03] hindrance
[1:36:07] and then as the scripture says we should
[1:36:08] not have any schisms in the body but but
[1:36:11] all of a sudden these things happen and
[1:36:12] people wonder why these things have
[1:36:13] happened
[1:36:15] it's because people allow themselves to
[1:36:17] get out of place to get out of position
[1:36:20] amen
[1:36:24] so
[1:36:26] i'm trying to i'm trying to stop but
[1:36:29] y'all just pray for me but
[1:36:31] you know i you know because everything
[1:36:33] that we do
[1:36:34] is an act of worship
[1:36:39] everything that everything that we do
[1:36:40] and you know as the scripture tells us
[1:36:42] in in psalms
[1:36:44] he said he said let the words of my
[1:36:46] mouth and the meditation of my heart be
[1:36:48] acceptable in thy sight
[1:36:51] you know and every and everything that
[1:36:52] we do let me be honored to god
[1:36:57] because you know the things that we
[1:36:58] meditate on you know brother brown was
[1:37:00] talking about the things that you
[1:37:01] meditate on the things that you feed on
[1:37:04] then it becomes a you know an act it
[1:37:06] becomes a word and it becomes a thought
[1:37:07] an action so it's the things that you
[1:37:09] feed on the things that you looking at
[1:37:11] and how what you know then all of a
[1:37:13] sudden that's how you live
[1:37:15] why because you're creating that
[1:37:17] atmosphere
[1:37:20] and so if we would come that we always
[1:37:23] look to god
[1:37:24] always look always have him before us
[1:37:27] you know the thy word have i hid in my
[1:37:30] heart that i might not sin against thee
[1:37:32] as david said you know we always put
[1:37:34] these things out before us that we don't
[1:37:36] always you know
[1:37:37] get out of place but do the things that
[1:37:39] are honorable to god
[1:37:41] to fulfill the word and and you know to
[1:37:44] be led of the spirit
[1:37:49] here in in matthew finishing
[1:37:52] i'm going to finish this the the last
[1:37:54] part of the the reading here from
[1:37:56] matthew 15 when when uh jesus spoke to
[1:37:59] the
[1:38:00] the disciples and he said by their
[1:38:02] commandment by your commandments
[1:38:04] you've made the word of god known effect
[1:38:07] and ver and verse 10 says
[1:38:09] and he called the multitude and he said
[1:38:11] unto him
[1:38:12] to them hear and understand
[1:38:15] he said no
[1:38:16] not that which goeth into the mouth
[1:38:18] defileth a man
[1:38:20] but that
[1:38:21] but thou that
[1:38:22] thou that the pharise no sorry he said
[1:38:25] but that not that which goeth into the
[1:38:27] mouth that follows with a man but that
[1:38:29] which cometh out of the mouth this
[1:38:31] defileth the man
[1:38:33] then came his disciples and said unto
[1:38:35] him know us thou that that the pharisees
[1:38:38] were offended after they heard this
[1:38:40] saying
[1:38:41] and he answered and said every plant
[1:38:43] which my heavenly father hath not
[1:38:45] planted shall be rooted up
[1:38:47] he said let them alone
[1:38:50] they be blind leaders of the blind and
[1:38:52] if the blind lead the blind both shall
[1:38:54] fall into the ditch
[1:38:55] and then answered peter and said unto
[1:38:57] them declare unto us this parable
[1:39:01] and jesus said are ye also yet without
[1:39:03] understanding
[1:39:05] do not yet ye understand yet understand
[1:39:08] that whatsoever enter into the mouth go
[1:39:11] into the belly and is cast out into the
[1:39:12] drought but those things which proceed
[1:39:15] out of mouth come forth from the heart
[1:39:17] and they defile the man for out of the
[1:39:19] heart proceedeth evil thoughts murders
[1:39:21] adulteries fornications thefts fault
[1:39:23] witness
[1:39:24] blasphemies these are the things which
[1:39:26] to follow man but to eat with unwashed
[1:39:28] hand and washing hands
[1:39:30] defile
[1:39:31] followeth not a man
[1:39:34] so
[1:39:37] we'll begin to speak in this
[1:39:39] when jesus began to to speak of this and
[1:39:42] it's to understand what what comes out
[1:39:45] of a man
[1:39:48] you know they were so the pharisees were
[1:39:50] so connected to the external to what was
[1:39:52] on the outside what was looking
[1:39:56] but god looked on the heart
[1:39:59] and he said what's on the inside
[1:40:02] you know they were so connected that
[1:40:04] that you know with the external and the
[1:40:07] life that they live and how how close it
[1:40:09] was and and all these things but when
[1:40:11] they didn't recognize the word
[1:40:13] and even those that recognized the word
[1:40:15] did not believe the word
[1:40:18] even when jesus began to speak to the
[1:40:20] the pharisees and the scribes and he
[1:40:22] began to point the scripture out to him
[1:40:24] and identify who he was
[1:40:28] and you know he said he said he said if
[1:40:30] i hadn't come
[1:40:32] he said you'd had a covering
[1:40:35] he said you'd have been okay
[1:40:38] but he said you've seen this and you've
[1:40:40] heard this
[1:40:42] and he told them then then you'll be
[1:40:45] responsible for this
[1:40:47] you don't have a covering anymore
[1:40:50] and they were going to have to answer
[1:40:51] for that
[1:40:53] but he said he said the things that were
[1:40:55] inside of a man
[1:40:58] not not the outside
[1:41:00] when
[1:41:02] peter was asking him
[1:41:04] about
[1:41:06] those things what's what comes from the
[1:41:08] inside
[1:41:10] the scripture says from the abundance of
[1:41:11] the heart the mouth speaketh
[1:41:15] so
[1:41:16] what do you feed on
[1:41:18] the things that you do
[1:41:23] you know there's a a song and i can't
[1:41:25] and i can't remember who's saying it but
[1:41:28] uh
[1:41:29] y'all y'all might know it but you know
[1:41:30] it's a little song called every little
[1:41:32] thing i say and do
[1:41:34] ought to be pleasing to the lord
[1:41:37] every little thing i say and do ought to
[1:41:38] be pleasing to the lord
[1:41:42] and and what's the other part of it
[1:41:47] every every little thing in my life
[1:41:49] ought to reflect the lord jesus christ
[1:41:53] everything i say and do ought to be
[1:41:54] pleasing to the lord
[1:41:57] so when we come to to worship
[1:42:00] everything we all everything that we see
[1:42:02] in our lives
[1:42:04] we ought to see that as an act of
[1:42:05] worship
[1:42:07] let's all stand have the have the
[1:42:08] musicians coming
[1:42:18] i didn't think i'd go this long tonight
[1:42:20] but
[1:42:22] you know everything that we do
[1:42:26] i just you know that we see it as an act
[1:42:28] of worship that when when we see these
[1:42:30] things in our lives
[1:42:34] you know when
[1:42:36] you know
[1:42:37] when you see the
[1:42:39] certain times you see people it's got
[1:42:42] things wrong with them
[1:42:46] and you know it's it's so
[1:42:49] in
[1:42:52] medically people have things wrong with
[1:42:54] them
[1:42:55] and
[1:42:57] i've known i've known people has had it
[1:42:58] you know they had infections and and
[1:43:00] different things and and you know and
[1:43:03] and then they said well i'm okay i'm
[1:43:04] okay
[1:43:07] and they just continue to go on
[1:43:11] and you know and it's like well i'm okay
[1:43:14] i'm going i'll make it
[1:43:17] but you know everybody else around them
[1:43:18] sees it you know you're getting worse
[1:43:20] you're not making it
[1:43:22] you're not going to make it and then
[1:43:24] people people's like well you know i i
[1:43:26] felt funny the other day but you know i
[1:43:28] just kept going going
[1:43:30] then all of a sudden they take him to
[1:43:31] the hospital and said you know what if
[1:43:33] you wasn't here within the hour you'd
[1:43:34] have been dead
[1:43:39] and it's like well you know i i i
[1:43:41] thought it was gonna be okay
[1:43:44] and there's people that's this i i knew
[1:43:46] a man that he had
[1:43:49] epilepsy
[1:43:52] and you know he kept having problems
[1:43:54] with it and instead of going to the
[1:43:55] doctor
[1:43:56] he just stayed home
[1:44:00] and you know it's like you need to you
[1:44:01] need to go see the doctor you need to
[1:44:03] find out about this you need to get
[1:44:06] well then all of a sudden nobody heard
[1:44:08] from him they went to his house they
[1:44:09] found him dead
[1:44:11] and he was he'd got up in the middle of
[1:44:13] night went to the bathroom went back to
[1:44:14] bed and fell before he got there
[1:44:19] and it's the same thing with you and i
[1:44:22] you know sometimes the lord will speak
[1:44:24] to us about things and we'll say well
[1:44:26] i'll be okay
[1:44:27] i'll be okay
[1:44:30] and it's like no the lord's speaking to
[1:44:31] you need to do something about that
[1:44:34] when the word comes and it's like well
[1:44:35] you know then you know we say well you
[1:44:37] know i i love the lord and i want i want
[1:44:39] to do so i want to serve the lord i want
[1:44:41] to do these things and it's like you
[1:44:42] know
[1:44:43] you know when we come to church and we
[1:44:45] want to worship god and we want to we
[1:44:46] want to
[1:44:48] adore him and we we want to honor him
[1:44:50] and we want to we want to show that we
[1:44:52] want to magnify him and we want to have
[1:44:53] a public acknowledgement of what he's
[1:44:56] done for us
[1:44:58] but when he comes and he speaks to us
[1:45:00] and then if we don't act on that
[1:45:04] then you know what that's not that's not
[1:45:05] an honor that's not that's not adoration
[1:45:08] that's not a part that's not a a public
[1:45:11] acknowledgement of his glory
[1:45:14] but if we don't act on that then you
[1:45:16] know what we then we've then we've
[1:45:18] turned him away
[1:45:21] and we've dishonored him
[1:45:27] and if we and if we if we are so you
[1:45:30] know if we see things in our lives and
[1:45:32] you know we say we love the lord and we
[1:45:34] want to worship him
[1:45:37] then everything that we do every little
[1:45:39] thing that we do is an honor to him
[1:45:42] to live the life
