[9:28] with he's gonna have knee replacement so
[9:30] I don't he might get him gave him a
[9:32] prayer cloth
[9:34] so y'all just remember him
[9:38] Daniel chapter 6 verse 1 says
[9:41] it pleased Darius to set over the
[9:44] kingdom an hundred and twenty princes
[9:47] which should be over the whole kingdom
[9:51] and
[9:52] over these three presidents of whom
[9:55] Daniel was first that the Prince might
[9:58] give accounts unto them and the King
[10:00] should have no damage then this Daniel
[10:04] was preferred above the presidents and
[10:06] princes because an excellent spirit was
[10:09] in him and the King felt to set him over
[10:11] the whole realm
[10:13] then the present presidents and princes
[10:16] sought to find occasion against Daniel
[10:18] concerning the kingdom but they could
[10:20] not find not occasion nor fault for as
[10:22] much as he was faithful neither was
[10:24] there any error or fault found in him
[10:26] then said these men we shall not find
[10:29] any occasion except this Daniel against
[10:32] this Daniel except we find it against
[10:34] him concerning the law of his God then
[10:37] these presidents and princes assembled
[10:39] together to the king and said thus unto
[10:41] him King Darius live forever all the
[10:45] presidents of the kingdom the governors
[10:48] and the princes and the counselors and
[10:50] the captains have consulted together to
[10:52] establish a royal statute and to make a
[10:54] firm decree that whosoever shall ask a
[10:57] petition of any God or man for thirty
[10:59] days save of the O king he shall be cast
[11:02] into the den of lions a man god bless
[11:05] you tonight you may be seated
[11:08] we've all we all know the story of
[11:12] Daniel in the lion's den
[11:14] that's not
[11:17] that's not gonna be anything new to us
[11:20] but you know the one thing that I kept
[11:23] coming back to this the scripture where
[11:26] it talks about Daniel was faithful
[11:29] and it's and that we're just you know
[11:32] being faithful you know God is faithful
[11:37] you know God's not faithful to me he's
[11:40] not faithful to you but he's a fake but
[11:42] he's faithful to his word because he is
[11:44] he is his word you can't separate the
[11:47] two and he's faithful to what what the
[11:50] word says and that's the reason he said
[11:53] the only way that you can approach God
[11:54] is by the word it's through the word
[11:56] that's how we approach God to know and
[11:58] you know there's there's many scriptures
[12:00] in the in the Bible and I didn't I can
[12:03] give these scriptures to them
[12:06] you know just y'all just pray for me
[12:11] you know sometimes like I think we're
[12:15] brother wake was talking about some time
[12:16] back you know you can try to get a
[12:18] sermon together and
[12:20] some are easier than others sometimes
[12:23] you know you feel like you're
[12:24] I
[12:27] don't know you're fighting all you know
[12:30] appeal all the way you know you ain't
[12:32] you know it's like you know it's like
[12:34] trying to push a rope you know you're
[12:35] not getting anywhere
[12:38] but you know God's faithful
[12:41] and you know it's one of the things I
[12:43] was thinking about you know if we try to
[12:46] do anything in ourselves if we try to
[12:48] use our own intellect your own ability
[12:50] to do anything you know we're an
[12:52] ultimate failure
[12:53] you know we mess up anything and you
[12:56] know that's one of the things that God
[12:57] wants us to do sometimes we have to go
[12:59] through trials and tribulations you know
[13:01] to show who we are
[13:04] you know there's many people and and you
[13:07] know I want to look at a couple of
[13:09] different a couple of different people
[13:12] but you know I love some of these things
[13:15] in
[13:18] this is a from the book of psalms psalms
[13:22] 36 5 that David says thy mercy O Lord
[13:25] is in the heavens faithfulness reaches
[13:29] unto the clouds
[13:35] he says I will sing of the mercies of
[13:38] the Lord forever with my mouth will I
[13:40] make known by faithfulness to all
[13:43] generations Psalms 89
[13:46] verse 1 verse
[13:50] 89 verse 2 says for I have said mercy
[13:54] shall be built up forever thy
[13:56] faithfulness shall doubt establish in
[13:58] the very heavens
[14:00] Psalms 89 verse 5 and says and the
[14:03] heavens shall praise thy wonders o Lord
[14:05] thy faithfulness also in the
[14:07] congregation of the Saints
[14:12] Psalms 89 verse 8 says O Lord God of
[14:15] hosts who is a strong Lord like unto
[14:17] thee or to thy faithfulness round about
[14:20] thee
[14:24] and so their
[14:28] Psalms 119 96 thy faithfulness is and
[14:32] all generations thou has established
[14:33] earth and it abideth
[14:36] and limitations tells us that he says
[14:40] talking about the mercies and everything
[14:42] limitations 323 talks about the mercies
[14:45] everything and it says they are new
[14:47] every morning great is thy faithfulness
[14:50] so many times but I you know sometimes
[14:53] if you ever get I don't know if you ever
[14:56] get
[14:57] down
[14:59] if you if you ever get
[15:03] if you get depressed I
[15:07] don't think there's a better book in the
[15:10] Bible to me sometimes than to get in the
[15:11] Book of Psalms you
[15:13] know you start reading you start reading
[15:16] the things that David starts talking
[15:18] about and he starts talking about how
[15:20] God how great God is and had the mercies
[15:22] of God and the grace of God and the
[15:25] healing power of God in his deliverance
[15:28] and all these different things and you
[15:29] know you start realizing you know that's
[15:31] to you
[15:32] and I tell you what you know it's just
[15:34] like a good it's like a good drug
[15:36] sometimes you know everybody wants to
[15:38] find a find the new drug for this and
[15:40] you know they to have a prescription but
[15:42] I tell you what the prescription is this
[15:44] right here doctor Jesus has a wonderful
[15:48] prescription I tell you what you get in
[15:49] the Word of God and you know what it
[15:51] just seems to uplift you and you know
[15:53] what because you can draw on that and
[15:55] you know that's the thing that we have
[15:56] to do is get in to stay in the Word of
[15:58] God because you know you know you can't
[16:00] fight a battle without being behind the
[16:03] word being fortified in the word
[16:06] but I'm so glad that he's faithful he's
[16:09] faithful to us even we're not faithful
[16:11] to him and I want to be faithful I want
[16:13] to be found faithful I want to be as
[16:15] faithful to him as he is to me I want to
[16:19] be found faithful and you know here in
[16:21] the scripture you know I kept coming
[16:23] back to this this this story about David
[16:26] I mean Daniel and you know Daniel was
[16:30] was such a
[16:32] wonderful man he was such such a servant
[16:36] of God that people realized what kind of
[16:39] person he was Darius the King wanted him
[16:42] to be over everybody to be his
[16:44] right-hand man but you know he had such
[16:47] it he had such a a spirit about him you
[16:50] know nobody said they could put a fault
[16:52] a finger on any fault that he had
[16:54] anything that he had done wrong and they
[16:56] said and they said but you know they
[16:57] said the only way that we're gonna get
[16:59] to him why because they were jealous of
[17:01] him and you know you know I want to look
[17:05] at it a thought tonight you know you
[17:07] know what we look at many times we look
[17:09] in the scripture we see things in the
[17:11] Old Testament we look in the scripture
[17:12] we think and you know we don't realize
[17:14] you know those things are the very
[17:15] things are today you know there's no
[17:18] time stamp on the Bible we see those
[17:21] things exactly some why because you know
[17:23] God's Spirit is still moving today in
[17:26] the spirit the devil still moving today
[17:29] this you know the evil spirits are still
[17:31] moving today the same demons that we're
[17:33] back there are still moving today you
[17:37] know we find even even in the scriptures
[17:39] you know we start to see you know the
[17:41] script the scriptures are repeating
[17:43] themselves because those Devils had a
[17:45] had a position they had a job back there
[17:49] and you know what they have the same job
[17:51] today so whatever whatever the that they
[17:54] were doing back there because even you
[17:56] know
[17:57] we'll look at some of that later on but
[18:00] you know hey they still have that
[18:02] position you know what they have come
[18:03] after you that's their that's their
[18:06] position today is to be after after the
[18:08] bride
[18:11] now you know hearing this here in the
[18:14] scripture it says that they Daniel being
[18:18] a being the the greatest one of them all
[18:21] but they all of the other presidents and
[18:24] priests and the counselors and all you
[18:26] know they tried to find something
[18:27] against him and you know they knew the
[18:30] one thing that they could get Daniel act
[18:36] and you know the scripture tells us that
[18:38] Daniel done something three times a day
[18:40] and everybody knew it
[18:43] he had a prayer life
[18:45] you know he was a prayer warrior you
[18:49] know there's a lot of people they don't
[18:50] know what that means
[18:52] well you know and and I find myself
[18:55] lacking in in that you know we all we
[18:59] all can probably do a better job because
[19:01] that's one thing brother brems said we
[19:02] can't do enough of you can't pray enough
[19:05] and you know there was
[19:07] the story
[19:09] and I can't remember who was talking but
[19:13] you know the Stonewall Jackson you know
[19:18] you know there was a man that wrote to
[19:21] General Jackson was was asking the was
[19:24] talking about the scripture where it
[19:25] says pray without ceasing and he said
[19:28] how is it that you can pray all the time
[19:31] he said I find that very difficult to do
[19:34] that and you know what was so amazing
[19:37] was Stonewall Jackson's answer was you
[19:40] know he said that anything that he done
[19:43] revolved prayer you know brother bream
[19:46] tells us the story that he said General
[19:48] Jackson said that I don't open my mouth
[19:50] to drink water if they don't give thanks
[19:52] to God for the water and he said he said
[19:55] it becomes such a such a action he said
[19:59] just as I would pick this up and open my
[20:01] mouth to drink he said that's how
[20:03] natural it was for me to pray for it and
[20:06] you know when he told it Virginia Ella
[20:08] Terry Institutes you know he said before
[20:09] I go into that classroom he said I pray
[20:12] to God that he prepares me to teach
[20:14] those young men and he said I pray for
[20:16] them to learn from me that they've come
[20:19] in the spirit of you know and he said I
[20:21] didn't drop he said I don't drop a
[20:22] letter in the mailbox and he said until
[20:24] I pray for the person that receives it
[20:27] receives it in the spirit that it's sent
[20:29] in he said I don't open a letter he said
[20:31] until I pray to God for him to prepare
[20:34] me for the contents he said everything
[20:37] that I done revolved around God and you
[20:40] know it you know it seems like it seems
[20:43] like a very simple
[20:45] thing to do but you know that's what the
[20:48] devil fights you that you know many
[20:50] times you know people ask brother
[20:52] Branham you know
[20:53] you know how do I get closer to go
[20:55] what's the simple thing to do he said
[20:58] pray and read your Bible but you know
[21:00] that's what that's what the devil wants
[21:02] that's where the devil wants to hinder
[21:03] you it's a simple thing but you know
[21:06] here in fight you at it
[21:09] you know any time you try to do good he
[21:12] wants to be there he wants to hinder you
[21:16] and
[21:18] you know I like that little song you
[21:22] know the Lord will make a way somehow
[21:25] said wind beneath the cross I bow you
[21:28] know because he said you know and he
[21:30] said when I try to do the right thing
[21:32] evils present on every hand anytime you
[21:35] try to do right the devil is going to be
[21:37] right there to stop you
[21:40] but you know you know Daniel he had he
[21:44] had a prayer life with God and he you
[21:46] know he everybody knew what he done and
[21:50] they knew about his God
[21:52] and you know it's so interesting the one
[21:55] when you read in the scripture that when
[21:57] they said well we have that's the only
[22:00] way that we can get to Daniel is through
[22:01] his God through his belief and so you
[22:05] know they went to the king and they said
[22:06] well we have to we want to create this
[22:09] decree you know according to the laws of
[22:12] meze the Medes and Persians you know
[22:13] whatever the King decreed it couldn't be
[22:16] changed it couldn't be altered and so
[22:19] you know when when he brought that for
[22:21] you know here they are they go in there
[22:23] in the first thing they say and the one
[22:26] thing that you find out was and and it
[22:29] stands out to me when you read this
[22:30] story is that Daniel was not part of
[22:34] this committee
[22:35] and you and you would think that you
[22:39] know it just stands out to me that if I
[22:41] was Darius the King and I seen all of
[22:44] these great counselors and presidents
[22:46] and princes and everything like that the
[22:49] head man that's over everybody that's my
[22:51] right-hand man's not there
[22:54] you know you know that's just stood on
[22:57] media why wasn't there you know the
[22:58] first thing you would think that's the
[23:00] first thing that would happen if Darius
[23:02] was there's like where's Daniel
[23:04] but you know he doesn't say that but you
[23:07] know they go in there and as in the
[23:09] modern term you know they stroke his ego
[23:13] you know Oh Great King Darius live
[23:16] forever you know you're so wonderful you
[23:18] know and they know yeah they know how to
[23:21] get to him
[23:23] you know lots of times if you if you pet
[23:26] somebody and you know and you say the
[23:28] right thing and you smooth them and you
[23:30] know stroke their ego and you know
[23:31] everything
[23:34] then all of a sudden sometimes people
[23:36] don't think
[23:37] before they act
[23:39] you know and so here's Darius oh yeah
[23:42] yeah yeah like that
[23:47] what would you like
[23:50] and then all of a sudden well we have
[23:52] this decree we have we have set and
[23:54] counseled together that we want to pass
[23:56] this decree that nobody
[23:58] nobody will pray or consult anybody but
[24:02] you o Great King for 30 days
[24:07] well all of a sudden the King son sounds
[24:10] good yeah I like that
[24:13] when before he had it in his mind that
[24:17] Daniel was such a part of this kingdom
[24:21] that you know I got to put Daniel over
[24:23] everybody and you know when they were
[24:26] doing all that he didn't even come to
[24:28] and say well you know what let me
[24:30] consult Daniel about that he didn't do
[24:33] any of that
[24:35] and so you know he got all wrapped up in
[24:38] his self and he bypassed his right-hand
[24:42] man and then he went right in and said
[24:44] sure let's pass that I think that's a
[24:46] great great law let's do that and then
[24:48] what happens
[24:51] the scripture tells us that when Daniel
[24:54] hears that Darius decreed this law
[24:59] that made him praying to his god
[25:02] illegal the scripture says that Daniel
[25:06] went home and opened up his windows and
[25:09] pulled back the sashes and prayed to God
[25:12] as he had done at every other time
[25:18] and no and no doubt the scripture tells
[25:21] us that the spies were there because
[25:22] they were there to make sure to see
[25:24] Daniel breaking the law
[25:27] but you know what Daniel Daniel didn't
[25:29] change his you know he didn't say well
[25:31] I'm gonna pray to God but I'm gonna pray
[25:33] in the closet you know I'm not you know
[25:36] I'm not going and you know and the thing
[25:38] is is Daniel didn't go out in the street
[25:40] and stand in front of everybody and pray
[25:42] he didn't go with before King Darius and
[25:45] get down on his knees and pray he didn't
[25:48] be he didn't number one he didn't hide
[25:50] from from his convictions neither did he
[25:52] become a show-off
[25:53] but he went before the but as he done
[25:56] every single day was he went before God
[25:58] in his window and done the exact same
[26:01] thing on the roof of his house and went
[26:03] and prayed before God and the spies were
[26:05] there to watch him and they come and
[26:07] told the King Daniels broke your law
[26:12] well you know what then all of a sudden
[26:15] then we find out that the King is now
[26:18] he's all worked up because he realized
[26:20] the mistake he's made because now he's
[26:23] put Daniel in a life-threatening
[26:26] situation and they're really in the
[26:29] thing and you think about it the first
[26:31] thing that Darius thinks is I've just
[26:33] signed Daniels death for it
[26:35] he's a dead man
[26:37] because he's going in he's going in the
[26:39] den of lions
[26:44] and you know and the scripture says that
[26:46] when when Daniel come up to this and
[26:49] then when Darius ceasing you know dead
[26:52] Darius is so worked up but you know the
[26:53] first thing that Darius tells Daniel he
[26:56] tells Daniel he says your God will
[26:59] deliver you
[27:02] had had some confidence in the in the
[27:04] god of Daniel the scripture tells us
[27:07] that Darius when he when he went and
[27:09] told him then he went home and said he
[27:12] didn't eat he didn't sleep nobody done
[27:15] nothing but he prayed all night and he
[27:18] tossed and turned because Daniel had
[27:19] been thrown in the lion's den
[27:22] and what a what a horrible situation
[27:26] that we you know the scripture tells us
[27:30] and brother Branham tells us you know
[27:31] you never sim alone anything that you do
[27:35] that's wrong you you don't sin by
[27:37] yourself
[27:39] and you know we and you all will fight
[27:42] all the way through the scripture you'll
[27:43] find anybody that breaks God's rule it
[27:46] comes down it's calamity you don't just
[27:49] you don't do it by yourself you
[27:54] know so many times we we look through
[27:57] all the way through the scripture and we
[27:59] see all all the ones there's so many
[28:03] people that are that in the scripture
[28:04] you know that we that we see that when
[28:06] they come to these places you know they
[28:09] why it's so important for us to consult
[28:13] God with every decision that we make
[28:16] but you know here's here's Daniel you
[28:18] know when he goes in the lion's den and
[28:20] brother Branham says you know what you
[28:23] know
[28:25] it's just like when we had a wooden the
[28:27] three Hebrew children were cast in you
[28:30] know they were on a death march and you
[28:32] know when they went on this death march
[28:34] you know the people that went before
[28:35] them died and the people that tried to
[28:38] put them in the in the furnace died
[28:42] you know they make the furnace hotter
[28:45] but you know and you know
[28:48] you know you it was so amazing because
[28:51] you know they went out there and they
[28:52] said well this is this was the decree
[28:54] but you know we don't care our God's
[28:57] more than able to deliver us but if he
[28:59] don't you know we're not going to change
[29:00] your mind we still believe what the
[29:02] Bible says what the Word of God says and
[29:04] we're still not going to bow we're still
[29:06] going to change our way of living
[29:11] and here's Daniel you know I don't think
[29:15] you know when they when they threw
[29:17] Daniel in you know I don't think Daniel
[29:19] was calling the walls I
[29:22] don't think they had to tie Daniel up to
[29:25] throw him in
[29:26] you know they didn't you know they
[29:28] didn't have to you know beat and force
[29:30] him in no I think I think he was ready
[29:32] to go
[29:34] and your brother branham tells us in the
[29:37] message God hath provided a way you know
[29:40] brother brendham says he let Daniel hear
[29:44] the roar of the lion
[29:45] maybe his hot breath right against him
[29:48] that Lions were with their mouths open
[29:52] hungry down in this pit and the Lions
[29:55] rushed right at him and with a great
[29:57] roaring blast till they were ready to
[30:00] seize on to Daniel
[30:01] so right up until the time not only did
[30:04] he throw in but I mean right there they
[30:06] were right on top of him he said all at
[30:09] once he was covered with an angel amen
[30:11] lights swirled around him no doubt it
[30:13] but it was the pillar of fire that led
[30:15] the children of Israel
[30:18] he said God because he says God is a
[30:21] consuming fire suit you know there he
[30:23] was so you know it it didn't just you
[30:25] know you know God just didn't allow you
[30:28] know have this circle around Daniel when
[30:31] he went in
[30:32] no he got the he got to get the full
[30:34] effect of it he got to go through the
[30:37] whole thing but you know what God was
[30:38] there with him
[30:40] and you know many times we wonder why
[30:43] things happen the way they do and we see
[30:46] things how bad they have to get
[30:49] but you know those things happen because
[30:51] God wants us to put our faith in him not
[30:55] to have faith in us or see confidence in
[30:58] and other things you know you know it's
[31:03] just like you know another another story
[31:06] that in the in the Old Testament you
[31:08] know David you know
[31:11] when when we go back to the the Old
[31:13] Testament there in 1st Samuel
[31:17] you know if the children of Israel had
[31:20] to fight the Philistines many times
[31:23] and you know what was so amazing you
[31:25] know I wasn't one battle I think its
[31:26] first samuel chat
[31:29] but you know it talks about there was
[31:31] thirty thousand men were killed the
[31:33] Philistines over them the
[31:36] children of Israel and thirty thousand
[31:39] men were killed in one time in one
[31:41] battle
[31:42] but you know what you go back and you
[31:44] read right after that
[31:46] and it you read right after that and you
[31:49] know what the children of Israel in
[31:50] another battle and then they win another
[31:53] battle and then they take the Ark of the
[31:56] Covenant and you know God smoked them
[32:00] and they give back the Ark of the
[32:02] Covenant and you know all the things
[32:05] that they were just continuing the the
[32:09] fighting that went on between the
[32:10] Philistines and the of the children of
[32:13] Israel well you see all of these dis
[32:14] fighting going on and then and then when
[32:18] they can continues and you know we find
[32:20] out that the children of Israel win
[32:22] another battle and they win another
[32:24] battle
[32:26] and then all of a sudden so it's not
[32:30] like the the Philistines overrun them
[32:33] all the time but you know they did lose
[32:36] too
[32:37] but you know what they had a hero the
[32:41] Philistines brought their you know
[32:42] Goliath came out to them you know he was
[32:45] their hero he was their superstar he was
[32:48] he was to everything it were the whole
[32:50] Philistine army was wrapped up in that
[32:52] one man and you know he went out there
[32:55] and and it was so amazing the the one
[32:58] man that shit'll went out there to fight
[32:59] Goliath was Saul Saul of the solar
[33:03] salts should have been the one to fight
[33:04] that man but you know he didn't and say
[33:08] instead of fighting you know he stayed
[33:10] back
[33:11] and you know the one thing that solder
[33:14] Psalm didn't create any kind of
[33:16] faith he didn't create any kind of
[33:19] courage he didn't do anything to them
[33:21] but he created a whole Atmos a fear
[33:25] and he led Goliath stand out there and
[33:29] continually call for them
[33:33] and you know you know it's such a
[33:36] psychological warfare
[33:38] you know they talk about the the Battle
[33:41] of the Alamo and how Santa Anna when he
[33:43] had the Alamo surrounded you know he
[33:46] kept playing the same tune and you know
[33:48] all of the psychological warfare things
[33:50] that he'd done to those people we don't
[33:52] hear that here they are these people you
[33:56] know they've seen God move on the scene
[33:57] before and fight the same battle yeah
[34:02] it was the same people that they thought
[34:05] before God had defeated the flesh things
[34:07] before and here it is one more time
[34:12] and yet and yet they they let their
[34:16] their surroundings dictate to them what
[34:21] was going to take place
[34:24] you know here's here's the men it was
[34:27] head and shoulders above everybody the
[34:28] men that that Israel wanted for King and
[34:31] he was afraid
[34:35] you know and and you know what kind of
[34:37] what kind of God you know or King is
[34:39] this this is the person that you wanted
[34:42] to rip didn't you
[34:43] they turned they turned the prophet
[34:45] Samuel down and they bring this great
[34:47] man in
[34:48] and he can't do anything for them
[34:52] but here's here's David you know David
[34:57] passed all that by
[34:58] hey you know David come out there and
[35:00] totally listen I don't care what you
[35:03] have that that you have to say I know
[35:07] what God's done for me you know and he
[35:10] had a whole different mindset and you
[35:12] know he wasn't testified to saw what God
[35:15] had done for him what God had done what
[35:17] he had seen God do he didn't worry about
[35:19] what took place
[35:20] and you know when he went past all of
[35:23] that you know Saul wanted to you know
[35:25] train him and mold him into his own
[35:28] image and you know let me give you some
[35:30] armor let me know I don't need any of
[35:33] that let me tell you what God's done for
[35:35] me let me show you what God is because
[35:38] God's been faithful to me he said when I
[35:41] was on the back sheep on the backside of
[35:44] the desert nobody was there but me and
[35:46] God
[35:47] you know what God showed me God showed
[35:50] me that this little slingshots deadly
[35:53] that's all I need is that little
[35:55] slingshot it'll do the job
[35:58] and so you know when he went out there
[36:02] you know he went out there and he took
[36:04] on the life
[36:06] you know everybody else was afraid
[36:10] but you know he said well
[36:13] I'm gonna I'm gonna do what I do because
[36:17] he said you can't you know he said you
[36:19] send me a doll glass said you send me a
[36:21] dog you send me this little little ruddy
[36:22] fella that's that's the best you got
[36:25] and he said listen he said you come at
[36:28] me and if we throw your armor and
[36:30] cursing me and all the names of your
[36:33] gods and everything he said you made a
[36:35] mistake
[36:36] he said the battle is not mine
[36:39] they said I'm just representing one I'm
[36:42] just hearing representation of one he
[36:45] said you defied God you said you defied
[36:47] the Living God the armies of God he said
[36:50] this battle is not mine but he said I'm
[36:52] gonna be the one that God's going years
[36:54] why because it's just being faithful to
[36:57] what God said and he went out there and
[37:01] you know he didn't have to
[37:04] fight
[37:06] he just had to do what he what he knew
[37:08] what to do
[37:11] wound up that little sling there that
[37:13] rock
[37:15] killed a man killed the Goliath the
[37:18] giant their hero
[37:21] and it's the same way with you and I you
[37:24] know many times we going around the same
[37:26] mountain so many times we fake that we
[37:28] fight the same battle
[37:30] and you know what if God's done it one
[37:33] time you know what he's gonna do it
[37:34] again if you if you God has ever met
[37:37] your need one time whatever it is if you
[37:40] meet him in the same conditions he said
[37:42] he's got to do it again if he's ever
[37:44] done it for one he's got to do it again
[37:49] you know so many times we think well you
[37:51] know I'm
[37:52] I'm praying for healing and I'm
[37:55] believing for my healing on whatever it
[37:57] is and you know one day we wake up and
[37:59] and whatever it whatever devil you want
[38:02] a name you know if it's sugar diabetes
[38:04] and your Sugar's shooting
[38:05] through-the-roof one day and it's
[38:06] bottoming out the next whatever it is
[38:08] and you can't control it in that and the
[38:10] doctor so what we got to do this or or
[38:11] whatever else so we're gonna change your
[38:13] medicine or or whatever the problem may
[38:15] be you know what the Word of God never
[38:18] changed and if he said and by my stripes
[38:21] you're healed he said so though it's a
[38:23] finished work well you know if you know
[38:25] and many times we've gone to places
[38:28] where you know we don't wait you don't
[38:29] see a way well God touches you one time
[38:31] and he touches your diabetes and you
[38:33] know it goes and your body's fine within
[38:35] the next day you know then he's
[38:36] attacking you again well you know what
[38:38] it's just like a boxer you know it's
[38:41] just like a boxer you know many times
[38:42] when you went up when a boxer is
[38:44] fighting you know he's he's throwing one
[38:47] punch and he's trying to set you up
[38:51] you know because when you study a boxer
[38:55] you know you know it's just like
[38:56] throwing a punch you know you sometimes
[38:59] I just throw a punch just to get you to
[39:00] move just to see how you're gonna react
[39:02] to it but you know the other punches on
[39:05] this daily that's the one he wants to
[39:06] punch you with well you know the thing
[39:09] is the same way with the Word of God is
[39:10] if you if you've lined up the devil and
[39:13] you keep punching you know what you're
[39:14] gonna knock him out and if you've
[39:16] knocked him out one time then you know
[39:17] what you just keep waiting because it's
[39:19] going to come the time you're gonna
[39:20] knock him out again
[39:23] the problem is is you've got to keep
[39:25] fighting you got to be faithful to the
[39:27] Word of God you got to keep punching the
[39:29] devil well because if he keeps coming at
[39:31] you then you got to keep coming back at
[39:33] him because you know the thing is if we
[39:35] ever give up and you know many times we
[39:37] get down and we get discouraged but the
[39:38] thing is is you got to keep fighting you
[39:41] still got to keep going and so the thing
[39:43] is is you got to keep walking the same
[39:45] road that you've been continuing only
[39:47] just continue on that the same simple
[39:49] message that same simple walk and you
[39:51] know what you'll meet God there
[39:56] one because he's gonna meet you there
[39:58] you know it didn't stop Daniel because
[40:01] he just kept going on kept praying the
[40:03] same thing that he had always done he
[40:04] just kept on doing it and dead and David
[40:07] went out there and done the exact same
[40:08] thing he went out there and he met
[40:09] Goliath why because he knew what God
[40:11] would do and he was just done what he
[40:13] had done before
[40:14] and if you and if you and I are the same
[40:17] way because you know the same one that
[40:19] found you wherever you were at in your
[40:21] life you know if you were sitting on a
[40:23] Pew every day of your life and you just
[40:24] sit in church and you said in church and
[40:26] you said in church and you heard brother
[40:28] branham all your life and you and you
[40:30] knew everything ever since you were
[40:31] knee-high to a grasshopper you knew
[40:32] brother branham was a prophet but it
[40:34] never was real to you that you know the
[40:36] thing is is one day God had to cross
[40:38] your path and touch your heart and open
[40:40] your eyes to understand that you know
[40:42] you need a Savior and if it didn't
[40:46] matter if he was in a Catholic Church
[40:47] he's on a barstool wherever you were at
[40:50] wherever weary God found you God had to
[40:53] cross your path and bring eternal life
[40:55] to you to bring it to you so that you
[40:58] could see it because the first thing you
[41:00] got to do you've got to see it before
[41:02] you can receive it and the thing is is
[41:05] wherever you were at hey if he brought
[41:07] it to you and you know the thing is is
[41:09] if it was just if you just
[41:11] justification if it was just
[41:13] justification then you know what just
[41:15] because he come by your way and brought
[41:18] you justification then you know what
[41:19] that automatically sets you on a journey
[41:21] to sanctification
[41:24] because you know what whatever it may be
[41:27] whatever God has brought you to then you
[41:29] know what if you keep looking and you
[41:31] keep desiring then God's automatically
[41:33] gonna start bringing you to something
[41:35] else god god never hold you back the
[41:38] only thing the hinders God is us is our
[41:42] unbelief we're the only ones that hold
[41:44] God back
[41:48] while God wants us to get ourselves out
[41:51] of the way so that he can minister so
[41:53] that he can move
[41:55] but we stand in the way
[42:00] but I want to be found faithful
[42:04] what's faithful what God told me to do
[42:10] but walk by faith and not by sight
[42:14] to pray and seek his face
[42:19] and he said he'd hear from we'd hear
[42:22] from heaven he'd speak to us
[42:25] but do we keep doing that just keep just
[42:28] keep pressing keep pressing be faithful
[42:30] and what God has called us to you know
[42:33] many times we end up you know brother
[42:36] Branham said that you know everybody
[42:38] likes those mountaintop experiences you
[42:41] know he talks about
[42:42] Mount Sinai and Mount Carmel and all the
[42:46] different ones he said everybody likes a
[42:48] mountaintop experience he said but you
[42:50] know what you never can grow up there he
[42:52] said real growth takes place in the
[42:54] valley he said you got to go through
[42:57] some valleys in your life
[42:59] and so you know we have to go through
[43:02] these hard times you know just like
[43:04] that's where you know David met Goliath
[43:07] he had to go in a valley in a low place
[43:09] you know that's where God wants us to be
[43:11] at sometimes why because that's where we
[43:13] actually stand
[43:17] we can see where God comes and ministers
[43:20] to us and gives us what we have need of
[43:28] now here in this here in the scriptures
[43:32] back in Daniel chapter 6
[43:40] and it says in verse 10 says now when
[43:43] Daniel knew that the writing was signed
[43:45] he went into his house and his windows
[43:47] being opened in his chamber toward
[43:49] Jerusalem he kneeled down kneeled upon
[43:52] his knees three times a day and prayed
[43:54] and gave thanks before his God as he did
[43:57] a four time then these men assembled and
[44:00] found Daniel praying and making
[44:01] supplication before his God then they
[44:03] came near and spake before the king
[44:05] concerning the Kings decree hast thou
[44:07] not de signed a decree that every man
[44:09] that that shall ask a petition of any
[44:13] God or man within 30 days save the O
[44:15] king shall be cast into the den of lions
[44:18] he answered said the thing is true
[44:21] according to laws of bees and Medes and
[44:23] Persians it's all turth not
[44:27] so
[44:29] verse 14 says and when the king when he
[44:32] heard these things were sore displeased
[44:34] with himself and he said his heart on
[44:36] Daniel to deliver him and he and he
[44:38] labored till the going down of the Sun
[44:41] to deliver him then these men assembled
[44:44] unto the king and said unto the King
[44:46] know o king that the law of the Medes
[44:48] and Persians is that no decree or
[44:51] statute which the king establishes may
[44:53] be changed
[44:55] then the king commanded that they
[44:58] brought Daniel and cast him into the den
[45:00] of lions now the King spake and said
[45:01] unto Daniel thy God whom thou service
[45:05] continually he will deliver the in a
[45:08] stone was brought and set upon the mouth
[45:10] of the den and the King sealed it with
[45:12] his own signet and with the signet of
[45:14] his lords that the purpose might not be
[45:17] changed concerning Daniel says then the
[45:20] King went to his palace and passed the
[45:22] night fasting neither was there
[45:24] instruments of music brought before him
[45:25] and his sleep went from him then the
[45:27] King arose
[45:29] the rose very early in the morning and
[45:32] went in haste in unto the den of lions
[45:35] and when he came unto the den he cried
[45:38] with a lentil more lamentable voice
[45:41] unto Daniel and the King spake and said
[45:44] unto any old Daniel servant of the
[45:46] Living God is like God then thou service
[45:48] continually able to deliver thee from
[45:50] the lambs then said Daniel unto the king
[45:53] Oh King live forever my God has sent his
[45:57] angel and has shut the lion's mouth and
[45:59] they have not hurt me for as much as
[46:02] before him in its NSE in its
[46:06] in it in its in see who tongue tester
[46:12] tongue-twister yeah
[46:14] most the time I can talk I don't know
[46:18] amen amen
[46:21] what's found in me and also before the
[46:24] Oh King have I done know heard then this
[46:27] then was the King exceeding glad for him
[46:31] and commanded that they should not take
[46:33] they should take Daniel up out of the
[46:35] den so Daniel was taken up out of the
[46:37] den a no matter of hurt was found unto
[46:39] him because he believed in his God and
[46:43] the king commanded and they brought
[46:46] those men which had accused Daniel and
[46:48] they had cast cast them into the den of
[46:51] lions them and their children and their
[46:54] wife say you don't send by yourself and
[46:56] the Lions had the mastery of them and
[46:59] break all their bones in pieces or ever
[47:03] they came at the bottom of the den
[47:08] so Daniel went in and obviously made it
[47:13] to the bottom and they come at him but
[47:16] when King Darius made the decree to cast
[47:19] the men in that tried to kill Daniel
[47:22] they didn't make it to the bottom
[47:26] the scripture if you read that or ever
[47:31] they came at the bottom of the DEM said
[47:35] that lions killed the people they were
[47:38] throwing in and breaking their bones
[47:40] before they ever made it to the bottom
[47:41] of the den
[47:45] yo
[47:48] so you know
[47:52] it works amazing how that how that takes
[47:55] place
[47:57] you know we we've we look in the
[48:00] scripture and you know there's times
[48:04] that people
[48:06] you know things happen and it's so
[48:09] amazing that you know when you when you
[48:11] look at that just like the children of
[48:13] Israel when they're when they're
[48:14] crossing the Red Sea and all of a sudden
[48:16] this great miracle takes place and the
[48:18] Seas parted now all of a sudden three
[48:20] and a half million people start walking
[48:21] across dry land and all of a sudden the
[48:24] Egyptian army you know if if my enemies
[48:28] God can do that
[48:31] I would get the thought maybe I
[48:33] shouldn't go that way
[48:36] you know listen I mean usually if you
[48:40] study tactics you don't walk into you
[48:43] know if you see people going a certain
[48:45] way you know many times when when you we
[48:48] talk to soldiers and and people that's
[48:51] this fault and different Wars or
[48:53] whatever you know lots of times they'll
[48:55] see people going a certain way
[48:56] well you know sometimes they think well
[48:59] you know what we're not gonna go that
[49:00] way
[49:01] because you know there's danger there
[49:05] you know just like the little story I
[49:07] don't know if I ever told you the story
[49:09] about the three preachers that were
[49:10] walking across the water the first two
[49:13] started walking across the water and the
[49:15] third one couldn't figure out what was
[49:16] going on and he got over there and they
[49:18] and he took one step and he went up over
[49:20] his head and the second one turned to
[49:22] the first one said do you think we
[49:23] should have told him where the rocks
[49:24] were
[49:28] you know sometimes when there's a
[49:30] certain way you know if you if you don't
[49:32] know where you're going you don't go
[49:34] that way
[49:35] you know sometimes you know they're the
[49:38] you know you talk to the bro you know
[49:40] different ones that served in like
[49:41] Vietnam in different places you don't
[49:43] take that you don't take the trail that
[49:45] looks the easiest
[49:48] you know they're the ones that you know
[49:50] they walk up and take the long way
[49:52] around and you know they take the
[49:53] hardest way why because you know what
[49:55] your enemy's not going to booby-trap the
[49:57] hardest way to go
[49:59] he's gonna booby-trap the easiest path
[50:02] and all of a sudden here they are you
[50:05] know the Egyptian army they're right
[50:07] behind them hey you know they're going
[50:08] across we're going across
[50:10] well you know that's not that's not
[50:12] that's not good warfare
[50:16] but yo there they are going across and
[50:18] all of a sudden when when the children
[50:20] of Israel get across you know what it's
[50:22] death - all of a sudden you know the God
[50:25] holding them back it collapses on them
[50:27] you know many times
[50:29] people set a trap for somebody and you
[50:32] know what in the middle of that trap the
[50:34] person that it's set for is not the
[50:36] person that ends up in the trap
[50:39] and you know even even when you look in
[50:41] the Book of Ruth you know they did you
[50:43] know
[50:44] they said a
[50:46] trap for Mordechai well you know what
[50:48] Mordechai didn't end up in
[50:50] you know all the way through the
[50:52] scripture you find these things why
[50:53] because God delivers them out of
[50:58] and you know God is wanting us to walk
[51:01] with Him walk through these these things
[51:04] and you know what whatever God brings us
[51:06] to we want to be faithful to that to
[51:08] make our way through
[51:10] you know brother Brennan was talking you
[51:13] know he said you know
[51:14] when you when you look at the Word of
[51:16] God you know he was telling one time he
[51:18] said you know I don't care he said he
[51:20] said if my if my clothes you know my
[51:22] clothes match or or nothing he said the
[51:24] one thing I've got he said I want to
[51:25] make sure that my experience match God's
[51:28] Word that's why that's why I would be
[51:30] faithful to that that my experience
[51:32] matches what God says you know Abraham
[51:35] Lincoln said one time and he was
[51:38] during the Civil War he had a head and
[51:41] advisor to him in you know me at many of
[51:43] you've heard the expression that he said
[51:45] you know he said we're so glad that the
[51:47] Lord's on our side and and Lincoln
[51:51] turned to him and said you know he said
[51:52] he said my concern is not whether God's
[51:54] on my side or not he said he said my
[51:57] greatest concern is to be on God's side
[51:59] he said because God's always right he
[52:02] said that's what I want to be where God
[52:03] said I want to be what God's doing
[52:05] because God whatever God's doing is
[52:06] right I could be wrong
[52:08] you know Lincoln said one time you know
[52:11] he said he said you know there's there's
[52:13] a pretty good chance he got to people
[52:15] arguing he said one of us gonna be wrong
[52:20] he said you know people people trying to
[52:23] argue and he said he said how can you
[52:24] have people praying on both sides
[52:25] fighting the same thing and he said God
[52:27] can't be for something and against some
[52:31] and people arguing over the same thing
[52:34] and you know you know brother branham
[52:35] said you know here you got that you've
[52:37] got one group on this side one group on
[52:39] this side and here they are arguing back
[52:40] forth of who's right who's wrong and
[52:42] then you know brother brems says well
[52:44] let me just stand in the middle
[52:47] you know because people people make that
[52:50] make this
[52:51] assumption that's this sometimes very
[52:55] wrong that you know if you're wrong
[52:57] automatically right
[52:59] well sometimes you know we find out -
[53:01] both of them are wrong
[53:02] you're wrong and I'm wrong
[53:05] because you know if I've got an opinion
[53:07] you got opinion we run the real risk of
[53:09] both of us being wrong but you know what
[53:12] that what does God say what does God's
[53:13] Word say you know do we walk the same
[53:16] way that God wants us to walk that's
[53:18] what that's what we have to do can we
[53:20] walk the same way that God's walking you
[53:23] know do we follow the way God wants us
[53:25] to do you know because if we try to
[53:28] figure things out on our own we don't
[53:30] get anywhere we can't figure it out
[53:33] it was just like brother Graham tells
[53:36] the story about the Jeffersonville Fire
[53:38] Department I'm pretty pretty familiar
[53:40] with everybody but you know he jokes
[53:43] about the Jefferson Fire Department
[53:44] comes to fight this big fire and the
[53:46] man's out there spray a little water
[53:47] here spray a little water there and then
[53:49] he said he said the Clarksville Fire
[53:50] Department comes in their spray a little
[53:52] water here spray a little water there he
[53:54] said you know what he said they brought
[53:55] trained men in real men know how to
[53:58] fight a fire knew what they were doing
[54:01] and he said the first thing they done he
[54:03] said the fire chief was up the ladder as
[54:04] soon as they threw the ladder up he was
[54:06] up there and told him said come on boys
[54:08] knock the wind out went right in he said
[54:11] didn't take long the fire was out why
[54:13] because it took somebody who knew what
[54:15] they were doing you know thing is you
[54:18] know he said many times it's just like
[54:20] preachers that you have preachers that
[54:21] you know that you know if you if you
[54:24] don't follow God's plan you say you
[54:26] spray a little water here spray a little
[54:27] water there you know what you're not
[54:29] going to get anywhere why because you
[54:31] got to get to the root of the problem
[54:33] you got to get to the down to the very
[54:34] root you got to get to the base of it
[54:36] and that's what this this other fire
[54:38] burner he was able to do and you know
[54:39] what God won't says don't get a weekend
[54:41] we can march around and and try to do
[54:43] things in ourselves but wouldn't ever
[54:44] get there but you know what God he wants
[54:47] us to get down to the root of the
[54:48] problem you know what God can find the
[54:50] root
[54:51] well because the scripture says the Word
[54:53] of God is quick and powerful with
[54:55] sharper than any two-edged sword and
[54:57] it's a discerner of the thoughts and
[54:59] intents of the heart so he knows what
[55:02] the heart of the matter is and he can
[55:04] get to that point and you know the thing
[55:06] is is we want to you know have have a
[55:10] great
[55:12] thing take place but you know God wants
[55:14] us to walk the way he wants us to walk
[55:16] he wants us to walk the journey that we
[55:18] walk you know
[55:21] Braille Ramblers I think some somebody
[55:25] was talking to brother Branham one time
[55:26] and they asked him said brother Brown
[55:28] what you think about this you know
[55:30] juvenile delinquency problem and you
[55:32] know asking about juvenile delinquency
[55:33] and he said well one juvenile
[55:34] delinquency sperry delinquency
[55:37] you know everybody wants to beat on the
[55:39] children well it's all your fault so
[55:40] your oh no lots of times you said it's
[55:42] the parents fault
[55:44] well because if the parents and parents
[55:47] are more responsible than the kids are
[55:50] because if you don't train them up if
[55:52] you don't stay up because you know
[55:54] you're you have to be there Holy Ghost
[55:56] you have to be the one that oversees
[55:58] them and leads them and guides them
[56:00] until until they're accountable for
[56:01] themselves
[56:02] but you know if we don't do that that we
[56:05] can't you can't hold anybody else
[56:06] responsible but for yourself
[56:11] you know sometimes it's like you know
[56:13] what's wrong with you
[56:15] well sometimes if you look at the
[56:17] parents that's that's where your answer
[56:19] is that
[56:24] well that's what that's what I see
[56:26] because you know what you can't you if
[56:28] you anything that you say or you try to
[56:31] do you the thing is you've got to do it
[56:32] in the and the understanding and to the
[56:35] Spirit of God you've got to have the
[56:37] Lord working in the situation because
[56:39] you know you can you can do more damage
[56:41] than you do good
[56:44] you know that's tonight when I was when
[56:48] I was getting ready
[56:50] Adam he likes to ask me so well you
[56:53] don't preach on that daddy where you
[56:54] gonna preach on what you gonna preach
[56:56] other say they didn't know I was gonna
[56:58] talk about this not but I am and Mike's
[57:01] know where you preaching though wait for
[57:02] it so I told I'm gonna preach on the
[57:04] little boys and don't listen
[57:06] that's when I'm gonna preach on I'm
[57:08] gonna preach on the little boys I don't
[57:09] listen
[57:11] well all of a sudden he's older brother
[57:14] jumps up yeah yeah yeah and all of a
[57:17] sudden the other ones going yeah yeah
[57:19] and so they're back and forth at each
[57:21] other going yeah so you see you do this
[57:23] and you do this well I know it and all
[57:25] of a sudden they start giving
[57:26] percentages
[57:27] why listen 74 75 percent of the time
[57:31] well I like ninety no 95 no 99 percent
[57:35] of the time and
[57:37] it's like no you know yeah I do
[57:40] but you know what sometimes we you know
[57:43] God don't want on don't want us to come
[57:44] up there and say well Lord you know what
[57:46] I'm doing ninety-nine point nine percent
[57:49] if you're not sold out all the way you
[57:51] know what don't tell God how good you
[57:53] are cuz you know what God God don't care
[57:56] about your goodness because he ain't
[57:57] looking at your goodness he don't need
[57:59] any of that the only thing we can do is
[58:01] come before God in time Lord we need we
[58:03] need help because you know what we can't
[58:05] do it in ourselves God don't want us try
[58:07] to keep scoreboard you know many people
[58:09] that they spend more time interested in
[58:11] knowing what everybody else is doing and
[58:13] trying to keep score on everybody else
[58:15] you know the thing is is you know I
[58:18] hope you hope y'all don't mind
[58:22] go go ahead thank you brother you know
[58:25] that was a man years and many many years
[58:28] ago and some of y'all probably know the
[58:30] song but you know the man says you know
[58:32] he said if you mind your own business he
[58:35] said then you won't be mind in mine
[58:38] and that may be the bad song to be
[58:41] singing it told about in church but you
[58:43] know what to send them it's correct
[58:45] you know what if you know people if we
[58:48] spend less time talking to each other
[58:50] about everybody else's problems or
[58:52] trying to analyze everybody else you
[58:54] know the only person you ought to be
[58:56] talking to about everybody else's
[58:58] problems in the church you ought to be
[59:00] talking to God
[59:01] if you ain't talking to God about
[59:04] everybody else's problems you ain't got
[59:06] no business talking to nobody
[59:08] but you know what we try to figure out
[59:11] whatever well I don't like the way that
[59:12] person does well you know what that
[59:14] ain't your problem
[59:16] if you ain't you know what the first
[59:18] thing to do if you ain't got on your
[59:20] knees and pray for somebody before you
[59:21] got up and said anything then you know
[59:23] what you don't need to say nothing
[59:26] you know what I get so irritated with
[59:29] people sometimes it just rubs me wrong
[59:35] yes sir
[59:37] I'm just gonna I'm just gonna say how I
[59:39] feel
[59:44] but you know you know you know it's so
[59:47] it's so amazing you know because you
[59:49] know we live we live in a godless
[59:51] generation we live we live in an
[59:54] absolute godless world and you know you
[59:59] know the you know the people the people
[1:00:00] that you know because you know what it's
[1:00:02] it's not the person sitting down here in
[1:00:04] the in the bar somewhere that's the
[1:00:06] problem it's not the person in in some
[1:00:09] in some
[1:00:11] house of ill-repute somewhere that's the
[1:00:13] problem it's the problem there's
[1:00:16] somebody that actually says there are
[1:00:18] Christian and tries to put fingers at
[1:00:20] people and you know what they got so
[1:00:22] many skeletons in their closet nobody
[1:00:24] wants to look
[1:00:27] well the scripture tells us you know
[1:00:29] while we trying to pull a speck out of
[1:00:30] our brothers eye when we got a beam in
[1:00:32] ours but we don't want to deal with the
[1:00:33] beam that
[1:00:39] might be off the subject but that's just
[1:00:41] the way I feel
[1:00:42] one because you find people that believe
[1:00:45] this message you know what if we're if
[1:00:47] we believe this message and we need to
[1:00:48] be sold out to this message we've got to
[1:00:51] be faithful to what the Prophet said it
[1:00:53] didn't matter whether whether it makes
[1:00:56] us over the coals or it hurts our
[1:00:57] feelings or whatever else you know we've
[1:00:59] got to be faithful to what God's called
[1:01:01] us to and you know the thing is is
[1:01:03] everybody collects two folk the
[1:01:04] scripture where brother the quote where
[1:01:06] brother Branham says yeah well you know
[1:01:07] you know you know you better not shout
[1:01:09] you better not jump too high if you fall
[1:01:10] to come back down you better better walk
[1:01:12] straight line don't jump no higher than
[1:01:13] you can live well you know what the
[1:01:16] problem is is nobody nobody and I don't
[1:01:18] believe in living right I
[1:01:21] don't believe it I don't leave no greasy
[1:01:23] grace or nothing else but there's one
[1:01:25] thing about it is when you try to
[1:01:27] measure everybody by your experience and
[1:01:28] by your yardstick that ain't no none of
[1:01:30] your business
[1:01:35] you know God measures somebody
[1:01:39] and you know and if we ever if we ever
[1:01:42] got to the place you know because
[1:01:44] there's times people want to say things
[1:01:46] and and
[1:01:47] and people don't realize this that if
[1:01:49] you say things and your mind and
[1:01:52] sometimes people say things and that you
[1:01:54] might have the right intention what's
[1:01:56] being said but you know what if you
[1:01:58] don't pray over it and seek God's face
[1:02:01] before you say something sometimes
[1:02:03] people take take offense at what you're
[1:02:05] saying and you've hurt somebody and you
[1:02:09] know the thing is people don't realize
[1:02:10] that what you're saying is actually
[1:02:12] doing more harm than good
[1:02:17] if we just if we just wait on the Lord
[1:02:21] can we just wait on the Lord
[1:02:24] and say what the Lord wants us to say
[1:02:27] Lord let us to be faithful to you
[1:02:33] the scripture tells us to judge not lest
[1:02:36] we be judged
[1:02:38] well let's be it let's you know the
[1:02:41] thing is is do we approach everything
[1:02:43] the right way because you know
[1:02:48] you know if you find a brother in a
[1:02:51] fault
[1:02:53] if you can find if you can find me a
[1:02:56] scripture on how to handle that
[1:02:59] you know not not the way some people
[1:03:01] handle it but if you can if you I would
[1:03:04] I'd like to see that because you know
[1:03:07] the scripture tells me if you find a
[1:03:09] brother in the fault you're supposed to
[1:03:10] go to him and try and try to restore
[1:03:13] that one I
[1:03:16] hadn't found one yet where you're
[1:03:18] supposed to if you find a brother in the
[1:03:20] fault where you're supposed to put him
[1:03:21] under he'll I don't know what your
[1:03:23] problem is or
[1:03:27] grabbing by the shirt collar what's your
[1:03:29] problem you
[1:03:30] don't get anybody that way you don't
[1:03:33] help anybody that way
[1:03:35] let's let's be faithful to what God
[1:03:38] called us to
[1:03:40] you know if we if if we if we show the
[1:03:44] love of God because if the love of God's
[1:03:46] been shown to us whatever you went
[1:03:47] through when we were in sins and
[1:03:48] trespasses and we didn't have anything
[1:03:51] and we were nothing in this world but we
[1:03:53] were lost in sin separated alienated
[1:03:55] from God and you know what the love of
[1:03:57] God come to us and you know that's all
[1:03:59] the way that you're ever going to store
[1:04:01] one is by the love of God to have to
[1:04:04] help someone that you've got to be able
[1:04:07] to help someone that way and know that
[1:04:09] brethren said you can't help someone if
[1:04:11] you don't know how to feel for that
[1:04:13] person if you can't be in their shoes if
[1:04:14] you don't know the situation they're in
[1:04:16] you're never going to help anybody
[1:04:20] and that's what I want to do I want to
[1:04:22] be found faithful to what God is cause I
[1:04:25] want to be a person that shows the love
[1:04:29] of God that I can restore something that
[1:04:32] I can help somebody
[1:04:33] because you know what many times in this
[1:04:36] world you you find a lot of people and
[1:04:38] you said you see that the things that
[1:04:40] happen to people and they don't see
[1:04:43] anybody they don't see any help well you
[1:04:46] know that's a shame that the people that
[1:04:48] go to the house of God can't find help
[1:04:51] if you can't and you know the thing is
[1:04:52] is you don't have you don't have to Pat
[1:04:55] them on the back and you know just go
[1:04:58] along we'll know but you know what you
[1:04:59] can be you can be there for them you can
[1:05:02] stand there you can pray for them and
[1:05:03] you know what you can encourage somebody
[1:05:05] and but you got to correct them in love
[1:05:08] the scripture tells us to
[1:05:11] reprove rebuke exhort with
[1:05:16] all long-suffering and doctrine
[1:05:21] and many times people have forgot that
[1:05:24] on how to rebuke reprove to exhort
[1:05:27] somebody
[1:05:28] they just want to rebuke somebody but
[1:05:31] you know there's a time you got to build
[1:05:33] people up you got to encourage somebody
[1:05:35] you've got to know how to deal with
[1:05:38] these things that he's quit preaching he
[1:05:41] started meddling
[1:05:44] but you know what you know it's and then
[1:05:48] and then yes but why are you talking
[1:05:51] about this well you know you know you
[1:05:53] look at the world today and you know
[1:05:56] especially you look at kids today and
[1:05:59] and it seems like it doesn't go a week
[1:06:02] and you find some kid that's on the news
[1:06:04] somewhere and it's
[1:06:07] there they're bullied
[1:06:11] you know you say you see all these kids
[1:06:14] and you the first thing you read about
[1:06:16] here's some kid and they hung themselves
[1:06:19] you find a kid that's bullied and you
[1:06:22] know and and they they went out and done
[1:06:24] whatever and they end up killing
[1:06:27] themselves they end up taking medicine
[1:06:29] or whatever else to kill themselves
[1:06:31] people who they've taken guns and shot
[1:06:33] themselves and you know the first thing
[1:06:35] you start reading about their lives and
[1:06:36] you know they can't find anybody that's
[1:06:38] on their side
[1:06:41] well you know what you're not you can't
[1:06:43] help anybody like that
[1:06:46] but you know because so many people have
[1:06:50] because they're looking for a God with
[1:06:52] skin
[1:06:54] and you know what you and I are that God
[1:06:57] to reach these people
[1:07:00] that people you know because
[1:07:02] years ago we went to Richard on my
[1:07:07] sisters we went to a Christian school
[1:07:08] and there was these little girls that
[1:07:09] were in the Christian school and they
[1:07:11] had come from a really messed-up family
[1:07:14] and you know one of the questions was
[1:07:18] they had to answer who loved
[1:07:21] that you know they were they wanted
[1:07:23] somebody and you know the only person
[1:07:24] that those kids knew that that loved
[1:07:27] them that they that they had love from
[1:07:29] was their teacher
[1:07:32] nobody that when they went home nobody
[1:07:34] that they lived with they felt that they
[1:07:37] had love they had any kind of affection
[1:07:38] from but it was this Christian lady in
[1:07:43] the school and she said that's the
[1:07:46] person that loves me that's love and you
[1:07:50] know many times you know we can feed
[1:07:52] kids we can clothe them we can do a lot
[1:07:54] of things but you know what they need to
[1:07:56] know that they're loved that they're
[1:07:57] supported and you know you can you can
[1:07:59] the scripture tells us you know we can
[1:08:02] we can take care of the natural needs of
[1:08:05] a person but you know what we need to be
[1:08:07] as a body of Christ we have to stand
[1:08:09] behind each other and support each other
[1:08:11] in this in a spiritual realm to know
[1:08:14] that people hate I know you know because
[1:08:16] it is you know sometimes you feel like
[1:08:18] you know I'm on an island by myself but
[1:08:21] you know the thing is it's nice when you
[1:08:23] get a phone call or something and you
[1:08:25] and somebody you know because the
[1:08:27] greatest
[1:08:28] you can do many things UK you can see
[1:08:30] miracles take place or different things
[1:08:32] but you know one of the one of the
[1:08:34] greatest things that's ever happened in
[1:08:35] my life is when I pick up the phone and
[1:08:38] I'm able to call somebody because
[1:08:39] they're on my heart and I tell them I
[1:08:41] say listen I don't know what you're
[1:08:42] going on I just want to let you know I
[1:08:43] love you I prayin for you you just been
[1:08:46] on my heart or whatever and all of a
[1:08:48] sudden they're out there and they're and
[1:08:50] you know they're thinking I'm on an
[1:08:52] island by myself I'm fighting whatever
[1:08:54] I'm fighting and I'm trying to fight
[1:08:56] this battle by myself and you know what
[1:08:58] it's great to know that we have a
[1:09:00] Heavenly Father that's on our side and
[1:09:02] many times when we think we're going all
[1:09:04] by ourselves just like Elijah said you
[1:09:06] know Lord I'm all by myself he said no I
[1:09:08] got 7,000 more that's never bow to me
