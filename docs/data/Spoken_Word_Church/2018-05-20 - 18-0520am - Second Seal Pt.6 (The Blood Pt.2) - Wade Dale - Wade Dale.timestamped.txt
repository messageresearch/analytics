[6:38] standing so long and it's coming up with
[6:42] the Father's Day fishing trip we always
[6:46] have it every year Father's Day but this
[6:49] year the devil saw fit to wash the road
[6:55] out so we can't get in to the to the
[6:58] campsite so we're going to have to
[7:00] readjust so what we've done is is we
[7:03] took a little trip up to to Guillou
[7:04] State Park which is about 30 minutes up
[7:07] the road and it's a really nice place is
[7:11] run by the state of Georgia and we're
[7:13] going to this is the only problem we're
[7:15] going to have it's just I'm going to try
[7:17] to make this announcement and then Joe
[7:19] will give you all the information you
[7:21] need so if you have any questions it'll
[7:23] all be on sheet of paper so there Bob
[7:29] I'll get you one witness tonight we'll
[7:32] trade the favor how about that okay that
[7:35] all right well you got a high and tight
[7:37] didn't you
[7:38] ma'am Monica get a hold of your head
[7:43] good thing about hair when somebody
[7:45] messes up it grows back but we're going
[7:49] to its death right instead of us going
[7:53] up on Thursday and fishing and doing the
[7:55] camping until Saturday we're going to
[7:58] have to do this on Father's Day we will
[8:02] be going up right after church at 3:30
[8:06] on June the 17th that is father's days
[8:10] for all you men and then we will stay in
[8:13] till Tuesday morning the 19th all right
[8:17] all the information will be there we
[8:19] have three campsites and a cabin and I
[8:24] always think of brother Gary Krantz
[8:26] every year because most of you don't
[8:27] know this but he drags that big old
[8:30] Outfitters tent up there every year and
[8:32] it's about as big as half of this
[8:33] building literally and about him taking
[8:38] it up you know he's not getting any
[8:39] younger
[8:39] so we're trying to no he said no it's
[8:43] not so what we've done is is we're in in
[8:46] three years you know what a year it is
[8:49] yard is a looks like a teepee on
[8:52] steroids what it is I miss you it's a
[8:57] big round thing you know with with six
[8:59] bear or six to futons in a bed short of
[9:02] sleep six and full power we will have
[9:05] showers for those of you that need it
[9:07] most of you that need it and it sleeps
[9:11] six so that would be 18 people in the
[9:14] Ertz and then we rented one cabin which
[9:18] sleeps eight and for some of you older
[9:19] ones that want to come that have never
[9:22] been before brother Colley you can this
[9:26] air conditioning and it has full kitchen
[9:30] so that's what we'll be doing all the
[9:33] cooking so we've kind of upgraded a
[9:34] little bit you know dad said one time we
[9:36] brother Joe green I'm have you been to
[9:38] the camp meeting to brother Joe greens
[9:39] for years it was under a what under a
[9:42] shed eight hundred and fifty degrees no
[9:46] doubt you sweat when you were just
[9:48] thinking much less singing and praising
[9:52] the Lord so
[9:52] then now they got they have it at the
[9:54] college up there which is fully
[9:56] air-conditioned really nice padded seats
[9:58] and dad told brother Joe brother Joe
[10:01] green was kind of saying one day he said
[10:04] well I you know this just don't feel
[10:05] like camp meeting you know Davis said
[10:08] look brother we getting older this feels
[10:11] just fine so you know and then brother
[10:16] Joe said that when he where'd the gap me
[10:18] brother brother Joe said well brother
[10:19] Dale thinks it's a good thing we're
[10:20] having it here
[10:21] so the same way with the Father's Day
[10:24] fishing trip it's always been fun we've
[10:25] always drug stuff up there you know 30
[10:28] mile or eight miles so it took you 30
[10:30] minutes to get there and we were you
[10:33] know trout fishing and having a good
[10:34] time we're just going to readjust this
[10:36] year though and it really for those of
[10:38] you older ones that want to come because
[10:39] it was a rough trip for the older ones

[15:34] us this day our daily bread in Jesus
[15:35] name we pray amen
[15:38] feel kind of comfortable because I don't
[15:40] like to rush through this and I got this
[15:42] afternoon you know so this is pretty
[15:44] good revelation 6 verse 1 and saw when
[15:47] the lamb opened one of the seals and I
[15:48] heard it were the noise of thunder one
[15:50] of the four beasts saying come and see
[15:52] and I saw him behold a white horse and
[15:54] he's telling them how to bow and a crown
[15:55] was given unto him and went forth
[15:57] conquering and to conquer alright we've
[15:59] been through that and now this is going
[16:00] to be the last one last service on the
[16:04] second seal we'll be starting on the
[16:06] third seal this afternoon and when he
[16:08] had opened the second seal I heard the
[16:09] second beast say come and see
[16:11] and it went out another horse that was
[16:13] red and power was given unto him to set
[16:14] thereon to take peace from the earth and
[16:16] he should kill they should kill one
[16:18] another and that was given unto him a
[16:20] great sword and may be seated in the
[16:22] Lord as blessing to the reading of the
[16:24] work go get char now I get it not you
[16:28] stay right there
[16:39] one day we might get one of these it
[16:41] comes down out of the ceiling you never
[16:43] know wasn't much of an amen to that and
[16:51] because y'all don't use it you know just
[16:54] watch it we are we are actually working
[17:04] on that we have probably discussed that
[17:07] this morning actually brother so we are
[17:10] we are coming together on some of these
[17:14] things you know we voted the other day
[17:15] to spend some money on getting them
[17:17] redoing this whole system so I've always
[17:21] wanted one where you I could sit here
[17:23] and control the the quotes not waiting
[17:26] on them not saying anything to them but
[17:27] still when you won't make a thought you
[17:29] can sit down and hit that button and
[17:31] it'll it'll you know you control it so
[17:34] anyway that's technology all right so
[17:40] now here we go we were looking at the
[17:43] first seal just for a background just
[17:44] for a minute which was the lion we see
[17:48] there's Lion ox man and eagle all right
[17:50] so that's your for combat beast and they
[17:53] were present with John on the Isle of
[17:58] Patmos now John John didn't see these
[18:06] separate and think man let's no
[18:08] John knew John had to holyoke John knew
[18:11] what that was that said come and see it
[18:15] was the spirit of the odds the spirit of
[18:17] the man the spirit of the eagle the
[18:19] spirit of the line alright because those
[18:22] for combat beasts are present today so
[18:26] what I was thinking about it yesterday
[18:28] so what we're looking in this second
[18:30] even in the second seal of
[18:32] sanctification that we see that it's a
[18:36] work and we'll get into it just a minute
[18:38] it's a work that we have something to do
[18:39] with because you can't justify yourself
[18:47] no way
[18:49] but you can help in the sanctification
[18:52] because remember the unclean spirit goes
[18:53] out why does the unclean spirit goes out
[18:55] how do you cast out demons in the name
[18:58] of Jesus Christ and man you cast out
[19:00] demons in the name of Jesus Christ not
[19:02] in your name but you in listen but
[19:04] remember to remember brother Branham and
[19:08] the maniac he said that man loved some I
[19:13] asked and said brother roundest didn't
[19:14] we that spirit was cast out of him he
[19:16] said but he came back he tells the
[19:19] people in the prayer line he said you
[19:20] believe because this thing will come
[19:22] back why you like it
[19:25] what our problem is as we like some of
[19:29] these demons hello somebody we like some
[19:33] of these demons they're good to us
[19:35] they're really nice they're sweet but
[19:38] they're demons bottom line all right so
[19:42] in this in this what I think about
[19:46] yesterday in this sanctification process
[19:48] the unclean spirit goes out and we were
[19:50] talking about last Sunday about
[19:52] compartmentalizing these things take
[19:54] away the flesh take away the flesh I am
[19:58] NOT trying to get this thing perfected
[20:01] it will follow it will come and I'm
[20:06] gonna read your scripture this afternoon
[20:08] before we get started in Isaiah and
[20:10] it'll help us kind of give us a little
[20:12] boost because I think there's something
[20:13] coming you know talking about the
[20:15] volcanoes in in Hawaii and the different
[20:19] things that are happening look at the
[20:20] world in so much turmoil why is the
[20:23] world in turmoil this because you and I
[20:25] are in turmoil something is going on
[20:27] that what the things that we have let
[20:30] reside
[20:31] I said reside not in the soul see so
[20:35] take the soul out if you're born again
[20:38] the souls just as perfect as God is
[20:40] actually the soul is not just as perfect
[20:42] as God is it is God all right so I can't
[20:46] you can't up and down in the soul if
[20:49] you're born again push it out it's that
[20:51] spirit realm the memory reason conscious
[20:53] affection imagination that's where Satan
[20:56] can still roam around
[20:59] amen but by the sanctifying process at
[21:03] first baby form sanctification he has to
[21:07] clean that out of the soul so that God
[21:09] can come in I read your quote the other
[21:10] day so God can come in God's not going
[21:15] to dwell in an unclean vessel
[21:16] something's got to be clean and set
[21:20] aside for service then the Holy Ghost
[21:22] can come in or if you leave it open the
[21:25] devil is going to come right back in
[21:27] gonna put you in the message church
[21:30] hello I may put you in the message
[21:33] Church you say yeah I believe brother
[21:35] Browns a prophet so does the devil the
[21:42] devil believes in one Garden feeds us a
[21:44] Trinity the devil knows there's not
[21:48] three people standing up there because
[21:51] you know what he's in that same realm he
[21:53] talks to that guy he's been talking to
[21:56] him since he created him Satan has been
[21:58] talking to God since God created the
[22:00] devil let me put that right amen
[22:02] he's never come to a place and said well
[22:05] I think there's three no he knows
[22:06] there's one but two what to dilute our
[22:10] to water the word down he says I think
[22:14] I'll get them to believe in three that
[22:18] way they get so confused they don't know
[22:20] who they talking to you know there's
[22:23] only one God we know that and Jesus
[22:26] Christ is his name and to me that's why
[22:28] it's so important with that first seal
[22:30] when that first seal opens and shows one
[22:32] true and living God that ought to settle
[22:35] everything because remember in that
[22:38] first part of justification those who he
[22:40] is justified he's already glorified so
[22:43] once you start into that justification
[22:45] process not baby for me baby form
[22:50] justification you can be saved and be
[22:52] lost a man because it doesn't do
[22:56] anything to the unclean spirit the first
[23:01] baby form justification just chopped
[23:03] your past sins off and God don't
[23:05] remember them no more but the prophet of
[23:07] God said that thing still there that
[23:09] root of evil so you just keep going and
[23:11] why
[23:11] you just get worse you just keep going
[23:13] and piling it up well yeah if you die
[23:15] you have a chance but you still got to
[23:17] go to the white throne judgement
[23:18] collects not bribed see I'm talking to
[23:21] bride when we're talking about these
[23:23] seals I'm talking about Bryce my brother
[23:25] Ram said he said I can call you bride
[23:27] now why he knew who he was talking to he
[23:30] had what he had come and he'd look at
[23:32] this big scope of people that he was
[23:35] preaching to and as he got more and more
[23:37] into the word of his message and then
[23:39] not the signs and wonders that brought
[23:42] everybody that brought the mixed
[23:43] multitude that brought everybody in but
[23:45] when he started preaching his message in
[23:49] the seals and past that he told him he
[23:52] said thousands of my friends will why he
[23:54] was narrowing down sure there was a
[23:58] bride for that age there was a bride for
[24:01] that Pentecostal age but he's not
[24:04] talking to that age he's talking to me
[24:07] and you remember you remember the
[24:10] crystal that we talked about that
[24:13] crystal is here that this is the people
[24:15] he was talking to amen so we listen were
[24:20] the people that should understand we
[24:23] should be understanding that that there
[24:26] is a baby for justification but when you
[24:27] come into the body of Christ when you
[24:30] come to that day of rest never brother
[24:33] Brown they asked him questions about
[24:34] that he said up there rest is not Sunday
[24:36] it's not Saturday
[24:38] he said you enter into rest when you get
[24:40] born again amen
[24:42] but see now that to me is a catch-22
[24:45] because you enter into the day of rest
[24:48] but today you get born against when all
[24:49] your trouble starts
[24:51] why because Satan keeps doing this you
[24:55] know why he keeps trying to get back in
[24:58] I liked it in there you were my good
[25:03] soldier what's going on so he works with
[25:06] the spirit realm if he can't get you in
[25:09] the soul he's gonna work on that spirit
[25:11] realm he's gonna remind you of
[25:12] everything you don't a mint he's gonna
[25:15] make you reason own things and that's
[25:17] why these cells what comes brings
[25:20] everything to a point laser-focused
[25:25] your I must be single you know when you
[25:29] look with a pair of binoculars sure you
[25:30] got two eyes you got one on each side of
[25:32] your nose but when I'm looking I don't
[25:34] see two images I see one why because
[25:36] it's a focus but now you take a
[25:38] binoculars and you move them just a
[25:40] little bit and get them out of focus
[25:41] what you still see but it's real fuzzy
[25:44] what we're trying to do now is by the
[25:46] Word of God by the preaching that's been
[25:48] in 50 something years since the Prophet
[25:50] left
[25:50] we're trying to thinking about this
[25:52] yesterday hold in get everything down to
[25:57] forget about this forget about that
[25:59] forget about what people think about you
[26:02] forget about what this and that and the
[26:04] other listen focus on the Word of God it
[26:11] will never fail you never I failed it
[26:14] many times but it's never failed me once
[26:16] I go to it hey man never has it failed
[26:19] me alright so in in baby form
[26:23] justification yes you can fall you can
[26:26] still be lost but when this
[26:28] justification comes in talking about the
[26:30] seal when you see there's one true and
[26:33] living God you know that it's names the
[26:34] Lord Jesus Christ you know that you're
[26:36] not talking to a third person that has
[26:38] to talk to a second that needs to talk
[26:40] to a first and what's inside you it's
[26:45] not a third person because most people
[26:48] think well yeah I got the Holy Ghost
[26:49] well who is that like the third person
[26:51] of the Trinity
[26:51] no no it's eternal God eternal God so
[26:59] don't worry about the salt like I said
[27:02] before watch the redemption redemption
[27:03] pull it back up one more time the break
[27:06] in the seals is not necessarily for the
[27:08] soul the soul is redeemed by the new
[27:10] birth what we were just talking about
[27:11] because you can't understand any further
[27:13] what we're talking about unless you're
[27:16] born again like brother down same thing
[27:17] see we're marrying this thing together
[27:19] he's preaching on this I'm preaching on
[27:22] this but it's basically the same thing
[27:23] you got to be born again and at faith
[27:27] before you can add any of that you got
[27:31] to be born again before you can add any
[27:33] of this we might the problem this is
[27:37] problem number one problem sure was okay
[27:41] we're boarding in but I don't think I'm
[27:44] good enough you never thought that
[27:48] before well you need to take a body
[27:51] change then go that's our problem what
[27:55] we do is what we make lists just ran a
[28:01] canard we make lists we list I did this
[28:06] I didn't do that I can't do this I can't
[28:09] do that get rid of them list get rid of
[28:16] the list list
[28:18] that's why I listen that's why we think
[28:20] whoa the seals is the greatest message
[28:22] sure it is but listen if Jesus Christ
[28:24] was the seal he was all of them he was a
[28:28] seventh seal he was all the seal amen he
[28:32] preached a simple message that common
[28:34] people heard him gladly so it's not this
[28:38] great mystery sure the mystery was to
[28:40] the outside people you a man make
[28:44] yourself God no it was God they'd made
[28:48] itself into a man amen
[28:50] pretty simple that's the same thing with
[28:53] the seals that's why the thunder of the
[28:55] seal was not some mysterious thing but
[28:58] he had it so mysterious to his head from
[29:00] everybody because remember dawn was
[29:01] getting ready to write it down the full
[29:03] plan of redemption John knew listen John
[29:07] knew when he wrote revelations five john
[29:11] weeped right john wept why john knew he
[29:16] was born again john knew he was born
[29:20] again he knew that that man that walked
[29:23] on the shores of Galilee was now inside
[29:25] of him but he still didn't think
[29:27] yourself worthy he still didn't think
[29:30] itself worthy who is worthy to open the
[29:33] book but when John saw Jesus take the
[29:40] book and then saw his name in that book
[29:44] he identified with that and remember he
[29:47] stopped crying
[29:48] and he started shouting and the whole
[29:51] everything hurt him from heaven to earth
[29:54] what a thunder while thunder that was
[29:58] the voice of God right through John
[30:01] worthy like I said before when Jesus
[30:07] took that book from the hand of the one
[30:10] sitting on the throne that book was
[30:12] already worthy he had paid the price
[30:16] he was just what getting the title deed
[30:20] back that Adam had lost Adam had the
[30:28] ability to bring us to pass no words he
[30:36] had the book okay when I look now look
[30:43] that book though was transferred from
[30:49] Adam back to who God the Father and then
[30:56] when the fall happened when God comes
[30:59] down in the garden and says I'll put
[31:00] enmity what do you do
[31:02] he drew a division or a chasm that man
[31:05] can't get back this away and God can't
[31:08] get this way at the moment then he set
[31:13] up bulls and goats so that they could
[31:15] converse but it's not full fellowship
[31:18] but he did give them away he did give
[31:21] them a example in the Old Testament I'm
[31:27] coming I will put enmity or division
[31:30] between what thy seed the seed of the
[31:32] woman he put a division there but when
[31:34] Christ came heaven and earth kids can
[31:36] brought it right back together hey men
[31:38] brought it right back together and you
[31:40] say oh that was God in human flesh
[31:42] that's exactly what Adam was before the
[31:45] fall now sure he was still after the
[31:48] fall but remember Adams carnal mind is
[31:51] what killed him compartmentalize it it
[31:55] wasn't his flesh his flesh only was
[31:58] motivated by what he was thinking
[32:01] his soul was the soul of God he was a
[32:04] son of garden he put he turned life into
[32:07] Adam soul but there was a spirit realm
[32:10] that what Adam do Adam stepped out of
[32:12] that he stepped out of that his step out
[32:15] of his soul but you understand what he
[32:16] stepped out of that realm and he began
[32:19] to reason in his spirit that's our
[32:23] problem we reason in that spirit realm
[32:27] we reason that we can't understand these
[32:29] things because it's so great no simple
[32:31] plan of redemption Redemption Redemption
[32:33] Redemption but this is what God wants
[32:38] I was thinking yesterday in that fourth
[32:44] church age that's where we're at now
[32:46] with the with the second seal we're on
[32:48] the fourth church age there had to be a
[32:52] time that they had to go in the ground
[32:57] all right I will restore now what do you
[33:02] do he watch now look Peter on the day of
[33:08] Pentecost when he said this is that this
[33:13] the Prophet Joel spoked I will restore
[33:16] the years of but now remember he was
[33:19] prophesying because the because the corn
[33:23] of wheat had wit in the ground yes sure
[33:25] Jesus did Jesus was the first fruit but
[33:29] remember here they started as a full
[33:31] mature church then it went in the ground
[33:34] and Nicaea which is right here we're
[33:37] going to talk about that in a few
[33:38] minutes right here because they suffered
[33:41] that woman Jezebel that was a jazz about
[33:43] religion come somebody able to preach a
[33:47] sermon now brother Bram did a good job
[33:51] with Jezebel religion he didn't get
[33:52] y'all with Allah but what he was showing
[33:54] he was showing that in that fourth
[33:56] church days they're gonna accept because
[33:59] remember this horse was white the horse
[34:02] we're talking about now is red same man
[34:05] he just got on a different ministry he
[34:08] just got on a different power so that he
[34:12] could ride through but you know what he
[34:13] was doing he was full
[34:14] well into very plan and purpose of
[34:16] Almighty God they had to go in the
[34:19] ground here why so that they can come
[34:22] back up because you don't start with a
[34:28] full grain of wheat you have to bury
[34:30] that grain of wheat then you have to
[34:32] bring two shoes listen the plan of God
[34:34] never changes that's why I like it
[34:38] planned God never changes even when you
[34:41] walk out here and plant something in the
[34:42] garden it don't come up seed first right
[34:47] it starts in a process of two ships then
[34:51] a stalk then a tassel and then at the
[34:55] end when you come out to the very end my
[34:57] apple trees are just mad my bees are
[34:59] doing a good job they really pollinating
[35:02] those apples and I got pear trees I mean
[35:04] yeah pears hanging like this and plums
[35:07] too but you know what the tree has the
[35:13] life but when that tree gets finished
[35:15] all that life is going to be in the
[35:16] plums and the apples and in the pears
[35:20] why because that's the fruit and that's
[35:23] what you and I are supposed to be
[35:24] bringing we're supposed to be bringing
[35:26] forth what fruit meat for repentance
[35:29] fruit that is that's what Jesus says
[35:31] Jesus was the master sower he had to sow
[35:34] the seed of the word not a seed because
[35:40] the sees the Word of God listen it's
[35:44] always been laying him and then we just
[35:48] got put in good ground give us some
[35:51] water
[35:51] give us some sunshine and guess what let
[35:54] God do is you know you know you have to
[35:56] stay you don't have to stand out there
[35:57] and say now now corn you got to start
[36:00] with just two shoes and then you come
[36:03] back about three weeks later and you say
[36:05] oh good now you need us no you don't
[36:07] have to tell it anything the law of God
[36:10] was put in motion when he said I'll put
[36:12] enmity that's the whole plan that's the
[36:19] whole plan you're lost and I'm gonna
[36:23] come and I'm gonna bridge the chasm and
[36:26] when I bridge
[36:28] chasm then you know what it's not this
[36:30] look at me it's not this Romans 8 says
[36:33] we are white heirs and joint-heirs
[36:37] whatever Christ gets we get you know
[36:41] what that's not me saying it the Bible
[36:44] says that that's our problem sometimes
[36:49] we read the Bible we go man I believe
[36:52] that and then you really look at and you
[36:53] say maybe I don't maybe I don't
[36:59] can I see myself doing that God didn't
[37:04] ask you he told you this is the way it's
[37:08] going to be hey man I was thinking about
[37:11] the other day but white throne judgment
[37:13] we were talking about something me and
[37:14] somebody but you need to come to the
[37:16] White Throne judgment the people who
[37:18] come up to the white throne judgment are
[37:19] going to be judged by their words boy
[37:23] but you're gonna have to go through all
[37:25] those if you're not born again you got
[37:27] to stand for that white throne judgment
[37:28] and you're gonna have to be judged by
[37:31] your words what you did and man because
[37:34] look those who is justified he's already
[37:37] glorified you and I are shielded
[37:38] completely from that completely no
[37:42] judgment why don't I make you happy when
[37:48] that first seal open that that's what
[37:50] showed me that God has took everything
[37:56] everything I mean everything oh yeah we
[38:01] have up days and down days what in this
[38:02] in the spirit realm but that soul of God
[38:06] listen when a saint walks across the
[38:08] curtain of time what a power he saw
[38:14] their dead know they just don't reside
[38:17] in the flesh you used to see their more
[38:19] live now than he ever was
[38:22] [Applause]
[38:23] and what listen once we see now that
[38:27] even though we are dying in the flesh
[38:30] we'd buy the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[38:33] and the opening of the word are more
[38:35] alive we're that crystal that God can
[38:39] turn the channel in the whole world can
[38:41] hear us because listen I'm gonna read
[38:45] you the quote this afternoon the bride
[38:48] because brother Brian picks it up the
[38:50] listen the first seal is super important
[38:53] the second seal is super important this
[38:55] third seal we're coming to is super
[38:56] super important we'll talk about this
[38:59] afternoon super super important because
[39:02] even on that third seal brother Branham
[39:04] says the bride hadn't had a revival yet
[39:11] so guess what you know what yeah we have
[39:16] individual revivals then we have
[39:20] individual PD parties amen been to those
[39:25] a few don't get an invitation I just go
[39:27] myself I don't have to have an
[39:32] invitation to go to a pity party no I
[39:34] just walk right on into it but the whole
[39:37] break the bride as a whole has never
[39:39] looked bad the bride as a whole has
[39:41] never been oh well people are leaving
[39:44] the message and it ain't bride bottom
[39:49] line they're not bright but you know let
[39:52] God do that let word we're like you said
[39:55] let's hone this thing let's get all this
[39:58] stuff out of the way and watch God
[40:01] because like I said when we come up to
[40:02] the see when we get to the third seal
[40:04] we're getting closer to the rapture
[40:07] rapture hot happens on the fourth seal
[40:10] amen so we're getting closer to the time
[40:13] of of body change and then getting out
[40:17] of here and to me that's super important
[40:22] Amen because remember it's going to have
[40:24] to be something supernatural because
[40:26] nobody ever done it no ever done it you
[40:30] say oh well you just said nobody ever
[40:32] done I said nobody's ever done it yet
[40:36] nobody's ever done it yet but we which
[40:39] are alive and remain I think we ought to
[40:43] put that somewhere on the wall we which
[40:46] are alive and remain my name is we
[40:53] listen what is our problem from the time
[40:57] of Adam we have disconnected from God
[41:01] have not had full fellowship until Jesus
[41:05] walked on the earth and it was only in
[41:07] one man but now that man the first fruit
[41:12] it's now inside of you what does that
[41:16] make you right here will bring full
[41:23] fellowship into manifestation and listen
[41:28] it's not I'm going to pray that God
[41:32] would give you this the Bible says if ye
[41:39] say to this mountain the biggest
[41:43] mountain we are ever going to face is
[41:45] death I don't know why I'm going this
[41:49] way
[41:49] bein the biggest mountain is death you
[41:52] show I'm worried about my job you bury
[41:55] work about death that's your biggest
[41:59] mountain and if you say to this mountain
[42:02] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[42:08] then it will happen that mountain will
[42:12] be moved but you can't do it as a baby
[42:22] can't do it as a baby up here I'm not
[42:25] saying a baby up here
[42:30] because you say that to a baby you feed
[42:33] that meat to a baby and it'll choke it
[42:35] amen
[42:37] it's slow wait a minute its food its
[42:41] food but food put in the wrong place
[42:45] will choke you amen so we got to be
[42:48] mature listen we have got to come to a
[42:51] place that like brother Brown said one
[42:56] time he said you job won't matter
[42:57] anything to you
[42:59] you got to even say your family it's you
[43:04] you know Jesus was so loving and kind he
[43:09] said if you don't forsake your mother
[43:11] your father your sister and your brother
[43:14] and follow me he said you'll have no
[43:16] part in his kingdom Wow somebody walked
[43:19] up and said no Jesus I need to bury my
[43:20] uncle and then I'll come with you in
[43:24] another day or two he said let the dead
[43:26] bury the dead you know what he was doing
[43:30] he was getting rid of the foolishness
[43:31] let the dead bury the dead
[43:34] listen if they're dead there's nothing
[43:37] you can do about it anyway like daddy
[43:40] always said we something we've talked
[43:42] about hunting one time and this guy's
[43:44] didn't want to walk through this
[43:45] graveyard they just said daddy said it
[43:49] was actually Daniel Wyatt he said Daniel
[43:54] he said them dead ones won't hurt you he
[43:59] said it's the live ones that will hurt
[44:00] you
[44:03] profound so don't worry about the dead
[44:07] ones it's the live ones that'll urge you
[44:11] alright so look we got to get to the
[44:13] second seal cuz they got to finish it
[44:15] now we know that the seals is a plan of
[44:18] redemption right it's what we just been
[44:19] talking about redeem redeem means to
[44:21] what bring back so we're trying to bring
[44:24] back full fellowship now listen let's be
[44:27] honest we fellowship with the devil a
[44:29] lot
[44:33] let's just be honest we fellowship with
[44:36] the devil a lot in other words he tells
[44:39] you something and you go well maybe
[44:44] maybe Bob did look at me kind of wrong
[44:45] another day you shake my hand that's for
[44:49] sure
[44:50] I think I'll just mark him off all right
[44:56] you know why and you say well you can't
[44:59] help those thoughts from coming you can
[45:03] but I have come to the conclusion that
[45:06] 99% of the things that you think are
[45:09] worthless and 1% is when God talks to
[45:14] you and that's worth something
[45:16] hey man he's all of that don't worry
[45:19] about that worry about we which are
[45:24] alive and remain worried about though we
[45:26] all right then okay because remember the
[45:33] full fellowship is not always with the
[45:35] brother and sister the full fellowship
[45:38] is with God and then when you get full
[45:40] fellowship with God that'll put you in
[45:42] fellowship with the brotherly kindness
[45:44] the man where you love somebody whether
[45:46] they don't like you're not a man and
[45:48] truly love them now look I truly love
[45:52] them not put on amen because you know
[45:55] what put on is if you put on that's the
[45:57] devil because the devil put on all this
[46:00] show to destroy the church all this
[46:05] horse riding and bow gathering and sword
[46:08] getting and it's all the devil's planned
[46:12] of what derail the Christian not to
[46:15] derail the sinner
[46:17] he's got them already but he feels the
[46:21] power I want to preach on that maybe in
[46:24] another month or so when we get finished
[46:26] with this the power that lays inside a
[46:28] Christian and I said lays because most
[46:32] of time we don't use it if we lay
[46:36] something down we're not using it amen
[46:38] but the power that we've been given but
[46:42] what is Satan done Satan says no I don't
[46:44] think you can do that
[46:47] you're not good enough well you know
[46:50] what Satan those who he's justified he's
[46:52] already glorified just leave me alone
[46:57] but we come to this one right here we
[47:00] come to the second seal and we we've
[47:02] been on it for a little while so let's
[47:04] the breaking of the seal remember it's
[47:07] not the white horse and the red horse
[47:09] it's what's underneath it and man go to
[47:12] tell you what just go ahead to review
[47:14] and we'll skip the two the two other
[47:17] quotes was about the the line ox man and
[47:20] I mean about the the first seal second
[47:22] seal third steal in a force field that
[47:24] was just the seal that was tore off what
[47:26] happened was is is satanist what he's
[47:28] done he's just throat all these things
[47:30] up he even got people to believe that
[47:34] the wild horse rider was a Holy Ghost
[47:35] that wasn't God did did that God can't
[47:40] deny his word or go against it so
[47:42] anything false doctrine wives never come
[47:45] from God so compartmentalize that move
[47:49] it out of the way if it's false doctrine
[47:51] it didn't come from God and it's not
[47:53] even worth to be talked about and then
[47:56] but review their sanctification under
[47:59] the seal clean and set aside for service
[48:01] that's what these things do so as we
[48:04] come through not baby form
[48:06] sanctification but a sanctification in
[48:08] the pyramid where what I'm shoveling out
[48:12] impatience well the deal will cover this
[48:17] hey I'm shoveling out in PI am shoveling
[48:22] out impatient so that God can give me
[48:24] patience I love that quote from Dwight
[48:27] Moody somebody made it the other day
[48:29] said he said God will only fill those
[48:32] who are not full of theirself amen
[48:36] profound God will only fill those who
[48:40] are not full of their self why because
[48:42] if you full of self there's no room for
[48:44] God but see this makes room because look
[48:50] this guy I'm going to say this guy this
[48:53] this anointing is already in you the Ox
[48:57] anointing the man anointing
[49:00] see when we get to that man anointing
[49:02] look that's not man's knowledge and that
[49:07] man anointing is not human man that's
[49:11] intelligence of God amen
[49:15] cover this afternoon going into the next
[49:17] seal but see Satan had to do that Satan
[49:21] had to bring it up to where that the
[49:24] intelligence of man were getting away
[49:26] but right in the middle that what God's
[49:29] raising up by Reformation my brother
[49:35] they'll remember but it is part of
[49:37] restoration because remember the
[49:40] Reformers can only go so far
[49:42] right because Martin Luther's
[49:46] justification listen you can't smoke a
[49:47] pipe and drink a beer and be in the body
[49:49] of Christ today but they could because
[49:51] they only they had a narrow view
[49:53] remember remember one thing for sure
[49:56] look at where Martin Luther was he was
[49:59] in the Catholic Church pennis try to
[50:03] beat these things I love me one day you
[50:06] know what he done one day God revealed
[50:08] that one scripture Martin Luther you
[50:12] can't justify yourself but if I justify
[50:15] you you live by that faith that I did
[50:19] the work remember he was a prophet I
[50:22] believe God came to me and said look
[50:24] forget penance forget all these things I
[50:28] saved you because you believed of Who I
[50:33] am and God was pleased with that then we
[50:38] come more what to sanctification where
[50:40] now we don't smoke him we don't drink we
[50:43] don't do the things that are the little
[50:45] frivolous things that that maybe Martin
[50:47] Luther did and got by with it because it
[50:49] wasn't the word for that day
[50:51] okay just widen even though they were
[50:55] that's what's so stranger's is they were
[50:58] writing the word at the time you know
[51:00] putting it together during Martin
[51:01] Luther's time Tyndale and all those
[51:03] people we're writing the word and
[51:05] putting it together but Martin Luther
[51:06] saw to just shall live by faith
[51:09] in see the rest of this he saw that but
[51:12] you know what God said okay I'll start
[51:13] right there
[51:14] because I got to build my church back up
[51:16] a man because the church went down here
[51:19] then it's got to come back up in this
[51:20] age and this age come here then alright
[51:23] say Amen
[51:24] alright so the Red Horse remember red is
[51:28] white red the red power of the Red Horse
[51:30] go to the next one
[51:32] the red power of the Red Horse was what
[51:34] to kill and what did he do he physically
[51:38] killed Satan what listen Satan got in
[51:41] the church and did the killing that's
[51:45] what you better pay attention to right
[51:46] now Satan got in the church and did the
[51:48] killing and then he didn't bring some
[51:53] barbarian from from Norway or the
[51:56] Netherlands and some big Viking didn't
[51:59] come up and kill all the Christians no
[52:00] he did it right there in their own yard
[52:04] the decree came from the very church
[52:07] that God had established you hear what I
[52:10] said God had established Satan said I
[52:13] think I'll just slide on into this one
[52:16] I'll kill 68 million listen Satan wants
[52:19] to kill all of us
[52:20] Satan's job is to kill what seek and
[52:22] destroy he wants to destroy all of us
[52:27] when we had opened the second seal I
[52:29] heard the second beast say come and see
[52:31] which was the Ox now the options of
[52:33] burden bear he's not real pretty I've
[52:36] never seen a real pretty ox but you know
[52:40] what God thought enough of that spirit
[52:42] of the Ox of the labor and the burden
[52:45] and the pulling and the things that he'd
[52:48] done that's what happened in that church
[52:50] age because remember anybody that said
[52:52] they were a Christian that's 168 million
[52:54] them got killed and at that time Satan
[52:56] was so closing that's in that fourth age
[53:00] till you couldn't hardly tell
[53:02] I mean look here comes the Crusaders
[53:04] with crosses on their backs and on their
[53:06] shields telling you if you don't see it
[53:10] my way then that Satan if you don't see
[53:12] it my way I'm gonna kill you so he
[53:14] physically killed Christians that same
[53:19] spirit moved right over into Eichmann
[53:21] and Hitler and still living today still
[53:25] wanting to kill all those people over
[53:27] there over there
[53:28] now and remember a yesterday or day
[53:31] before yesterday remember was the 70th
[53:33] year of the Israel being a nation there
[53:38] since pretty significant but that's not
[53:43] for us I'm s for them that's professed
[53:45] for that we just watch those things
[53:47] cause remember when if nothing can
[53:50] happen spiritually listen to me nothing
[53:53] can happen spirit we'll get to that
[53:54] later on in the seal because there's
[53:55] something coming up there in the sixth
[53:57] seal but the Jews nothing nothing you
[54:02] hear me God cannot now listen he can
[54:05] work but he can't deal with the Jews
[54:08] while he's dealing with us amen so so we
[54:13] watch Israel we look at the times
[54:16] because remember remember jesus said the
[54:20] parable of the fig tree so they're
[54:24] living a parable at the moment because
[54:27] we're here comes remember he's not a
[54:29] parable to us he's a reality then he's
[54:32] going to walk when we get out of the way
[54:34] he's not going to be a parable to the
[54:37] Jews he's going to become a reality to
[54:39] them amen and then he's going to save
[54:42] them can't save us both at the same time
[54:45] amen so now look compartmentalize that
[54:48] don't worry about the Jews don't worry
[54:51] about the world don't worry about the
[54:53] denomination worry about what you're
[54:55] doing here amen and when I mean worry I
[54:58] don't mean worry about biting your
[55:00] fingernails worrying I don't do that you
[55:03] shouldn't do that okay
[55:05] you should what you should watch be
[55:08] vigilant and be careful but don't fear
[55:13] how you gonna fear if you're already
[55:16] sealing in with God Bible says what are
[55:18] you gonna fear what the man do to the
[55:20] body he said you better fear the man
[55:22] that can do something with your soul
[55:23] amen why are we here we're here not to
[55:31] be like God that's our problem and I
[55:37] don't mind that someone to be like Jesus
[55:39] that's okay we need that we need
[55:41] be more like him but I thought if that
[55:43] same spirit that raised up Jesus from
[55:49] the dead dwells in you he will quicken
[55:52] your mortal body by that spirit that
[55:56] dwells in you we'll get to that in
[55:58] Romans downstairs in a little bit I like
[56:03] the book of Romans it's really good book
[56:05] good book to read but here we come we
[56:08] got here and then went out another horse
[56:10] that was red and power was given him
[56:12] look power was given he had no power and
[56:16] then God permitted him to do these
[56:19] things what to fulfill his word
[56:21] kornel he's got to go in the ground and
[56:24] power was given him that sat down to
[56:26] take peace from the earth and that they
[56:28] should kill one another kill one another
[56:33] and that was given unto him a great
[56:36] sword or a great word amen
[56:39] now let's see what that word does that
[56:43] word in the fourth church age-wise we're
[56:45] going to read revelations 2 verse 18
[56:50] cuz I'm telling you God allowed this to
[56:54] happen go to the next one there you go
[56:56] unto the angel of church the thigh tyre
[56:59] now that's the fourth church age right
[57:01] then alright this is the fourth eighth
[57:03] word and look we're talking lap overs
[57:05] here but still that that middle church
[57:08] age was like a thousand or so years it
[57:10] was the longest one God let it go and
[57:13] let it go and into the angel of church
[57:14] the thought I'll write these things
[57:15] saith the son of God who has his eyes
[57:17] likened to flame a fire at his feet fine
[57:19] brass I know thy works and charity and
[57:22] service and faith in thy patience and
[57:24] thy works and the last to be more than
[57:26] the first notwithstanding I have a few
[57:30] things against thee because remember he
[57:35] had bride in that age so we had to give
[57:38] him a blessing he has to bless his
[57:41] children and man thought you know why
[57:43] cuz he said he would God has to do
[57:46] things because he already said he was
[57:47] gonna do hey man we can't demand God do
[57:50] something just read the word he already
[57:52] wrote it we don't have to demand him to
[57:54] save my
[57:55] children he said in Isaiah 66 you'll be
[57:57] there with y'all for an offspring right
[57:59] mmm so I just rest on that that's see
[58:03] that's my rest I'm not gonna bite my
[58:04] fingernails I'm a rest on what he said
[58:07] notwithstanding I have a few things
[58:09] against thee because thou sufferest that
[58:12] woman Jezebel which calleth herself a
[58:17] prophetess to teach and look seduced My
[58:21] servants Wow
[58:25] seduce my servants to commit fornication
[58:29] because remember Father Son and Holy
[58:33] Ghost I read it to you nothing long ago
[58:36] was formulated in hell remember it did
[58:40] not come from God amen my servants to
[58:45] commit fornication and eat things
[58:47] sacrificed unto idols because look if
[58:50] you baptize that's why brother Bram said
[58:53] all these things he's talking about
[58:54] casting out demons in the name of the
[58:56] Father Son Holy Ghost in the demon just
[58:57] stays there there's no power in that
[59:00] but look Satan put it so much as an idol
[59:06] till they believed it you said Oh eat
[59:11] things like no I'm talking about baptism
[59:14] the name of Father Son Holy Ghost
[59:15] Trinitarian doctrine that was all from
[59:17] Jezebel you said she never preached that
[59:19] yes she did she's gonna kill the
[59:23] prophets she was going to she demanded
[59:26] to kill Elijah amen and she got her own
[59:29] church together and thought she could do
[59:32] what she said she was gonna do but she
[59:34] never did why because God killed her and
[59:37] I gave her space to repent of her
[59:39] fornication and she repented not behold
[59:42] I will cast her into a bed and then they
[59:44] committed adultery with her into Great
[59:45] Tribulation now that's the
[59:47] denominational world I'll read it to you
[59:49] brother Bram said that's the reason in
[59:51] the third churches he said I see now why
[59:54] I'm so against organized religion
[59:55] because that's what he done to him it
[59:58] gave them idols they committed
[1:00:00] fornication you remember when brother
[1:00:03] Branham was discerning that man remember
[1:00:06] the man walked through the room and he
[1:00:08] desert
[1:00:08] it as as adultery against his wife and
[1:00:12] he went to that brother and he found out
[1:00:15] then it was more clear when he got to
[1:00:16] talking to the brother picked up his
[1:00:18] spirit it wasn't that spirit of
[1:00:19] committing adultery physically he was
[1:00:22] what'd he say
[1:00:24] leaning toward organized religion same
[1:00:26] spirit and then same spirit behold I
[1:00:30] will cast her into a bed and then the
[1:00:32] committed adultery with her into Great
[1:00:33] Tribulation except they repent of their
[1:00:35] deeds and I will kill her children with
[1:00:38] death now God said that God said that
[1:00:43] devil didn't say that God said that I
[1:00:45] will kill her children with death and
[1:00:47] all the church don't know that I am he
[1:00:49] which searches the reins and hearts and
[1:00:51] I will give unto every one of you
[1:00:52] according to your what works but unto
[1:00:56] you I say unto the rest and time tires
[1:00:58] many has have not this doctrine and
[1:01:00] which have not known the depths of Satan
[1:01:03] as they speak I will put upon you none
[1:01:05] of the burden they just made it through
[1:01:07] that listen they didn't have a statue of
[1:01:09] a perfect man to listen to sermon they
[1:01:15] didn't have a sealed sermon to listen to
[1:01:17] you they just believed on the Lord Jesus
[1:01:19] Christ and they were saved
[1:01:21] amen but that which you have already
[1:01:24] hold fast till I come and he that
[1:01:27] overcometh keepeth my works unto the end
[1:01:29] to him will I give power over the
[1:01:31] nations and then we keep on reading but
[1:01:33] just going through now I want to get to
[1:01:35] a point right here so what did God what
[1:01:40] did Satan do Satan changed his doctrine
[1:01:43] Satan's always changing his doctrine
[1:01:46] he's changing his doctrine he has a
[1:01:49] ministry of this in a ministry of light
[1:01:51] and hey he's got 960 some of them well
[1:01:54] that was when brother Brown was here
[1:01:56] there's like 13 thousands of nominations
[1:01:57] now they can't all be of God and then
[1:02:01] their Creed is not from God their
[1:02:05] denominational idea under their
[1:02:07] denominational idea at this moment it's
[1:02:09] no good that's why when you get up into
[1:02:12] the seal see here we go we
[1:02:13] compartmentalize you can't be an adult
[1:02:16] denomination and know this message and
[1:02:18] be safe you just can't
[1:02:21] the door shut somewhere I believe that's
[1:02:24] what happened in 1977 instead of us
[1:02:26] going in a rapture I believe in 1977 God
[1:02:29] shut the door he said I'm not dealing
[1:02:32] with his father son Holy Ghost baptism
[1:02:33] anymore
[1:02:34] I'm not dealing with this Trinitarian
[1:02:36] doctrine anymore of course remember
[1:02:38] there were people during brother Browns
[1:02:39] time like I said he preached to
[1:02:40] Trinitarians a lot probably 90% of the
[1:02:44] people in there in the service were
[1:02:46] Trinitarian God winked at that ignorance
[1:02:49] but there come a time when brother Brown
[1:02:50] said now bride I'm talking to you God
[1:02:53] said bride I'm talking to you it's in
[1:02:57] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:02:59] angel amen
[1:03:01] which is right now so this is who he's
[1:03:04] talking to
[1:03:05] when you match play'd God's talking to
[1:03:08] you not somebody else he's talking to
[1:03:12] you right so he changed this doctrine he
[1:03:17] changed his tactics he's fixing to
[1:03:20] change it again though because when we
[1:03:22] get into the black horse he's going to
[1:03:24] change it again he's going to bring out
[1:03:26] a new doctrine brother Brown sent an old
[1:03:29] trend and you try to become out of the
[1:03:31] new Trinity you know what the new
[1:03:33] Trinity is ain't gonna say it not only
[1:03:40] somebody happens to do with a couple of
[1:03:42] people that are still alive
[1:03:50] well you figured out I mean they they
[1:03:56] brother branham was God and Joseph God
[1:03:59] please people yeah where God made
[1:04:01] manifest in another form but we're not
[1:04:03] God himself
[1:04:07] there's a big difference
[1:04:09] brother Brown said if you call me what
[1:04:12] Jesus Christ that makes me Antichrist
[1:04:16] let's just stop right there
[1:04:18] all right amen
[1:04:24] let's get through some of this because I
[1:04:26] want to finish go to quote number four
[1:04:33] now remember when the unclean spirit
[1:04:35] goes out of a man that sanctification
[1:04:36] that's clean and set aside for service
[1:04:38] like we were talking about
[1:04:39] oh you're sitting on the front row today
[1:04:41] where does that that black always in the
[1:04:45] back well nevermind I'm gonna use you
[1:04:47] daddy
[1:04:50] get behind me get behind me Satan when
[1:04:55] the unclean spirit goes out of a man you
[1:04:57] ain't clean thing now that happened
[1:05:02] before you were born again they meant to
[1:05:05] start with baby form sanctification just
[1:05:08] to cover something real quick but now
[1:05:10] what happened was is in baby form
[1:05:12] sanctification if you don't fill it with
[1:05:15] the Holy Ghost it comes right back in
[1:05:19] and he hides deeper than he hid before
[1:05:23] and then that's why the sanctification
[1:05:25] process is so dangerous to stay there
[1:05:28] because he didn't come back as an
[1:05:31] unclean spirit like you went out he came
[1:05:34] back more smart more subtle oh you got
[1:05:38] the Holy Ghost you believe the message
[1:05:39] don't you
[1:05:40] you have to holy go yeah you got the
[1:05:43] Holy Ghost but boy there's some things
[1:05:44] you really can do you know you do some
[1:05:47] things that nobody know cuz you hid see
[1:05:51] but no we're not talking about that when
[1:05:52] an unclean spirit goes out and then the
[1:05:54] Holy Spirit comes in there's no room for
[1:05:56] that unclean spirit that's in your soul
[1:05:59] compartmentalize that's in your soul
[1:06:01] amen but now when you're born
[1:06:03] in you've still got things you got to
[1:06:07] worry about temper see right there
[1:06:14] you need virtue knowledge temperance
[1:06:15] patience godliness now when that goes
[1:06:17] out he's still working on me see the
[1:06:23] Bible says even Paul says I die daily
[1:06:26] well that's what it is the daily killing
[1:06:28] now sometimes you let that thing come
[1:06:31] back but it's in the spirit realm but
[1:06:33] remember in the spirit in Sedona in this
[1:06:35] please don't get comfortable but
[1:06:42] remember in the spirit realm listen to
[1:06:44] me in this in the in the soul of you
[1:06:48] there is no lie no deceit it's the Word
[1:06:53] of God that all right if you're born
[1:06:58] again today and your soul is God brother
[1:07:02] Brown said you and God in there as
[1:07:03] persons all right but now in that spirit
[1:07:07] realm God comes in and he works but
[1:07:11] Satan comes in and he works because
[1:07:12] you're still living in a dual world is
[1:07:16] that okay
[1:07:17] because remember remember one thing's
[1:07:20] for sure Satan can't get in your soul if
[1:07:22] you're born again so he can't deceive
[1:07:23] you in your soul but then he can water
[1:07:27] down in that spirit realm make you lean
[1:07:33] member brother Brian preach that
[1:07:34] wonderful sermon lean not to what your
[1:07:36] own understanding all right that's our
[1:07:40] problem we have we have come to where
[1:07:42] man has told us even in the
[1:07:45] denominational world and coming right
[1:07:47] over the message that that there's such
[1:07:49] a crust on that soul that it can't work
[1:07:52] well I can't help you know like I said
[1:07:54] before I I still hate I just can't stand
[1:07:57] it is what it is cuz it ain't what it
[1:07:59] ain't can I say that yeah I still hate
[1:08:04] it is what it is because it ain't what
[1:08:06] it ain't okay because you know it is
[1:08:09] what it is puts you in the grave because
[1:08:11] you know what grandma died mama died
[1:08:12] daddy died right here the womb of our
[1:08:17] mind
[1:08:17] we got to be changed a man goes listen
[1:08:21] be honest with yourself if you're born
[1:08:24] again in your soul there's no death
[1:08:25] nothing in your soul tells you you don't
[1:08:29] die nothing there's no death in God off
[1:08:36] we believe that you got to keep
[1:08:37] cultivating that though go Satan sitting
[1:08:41] are you gonna die don't argue with him
[1:08:46] either because he'll win because you
[1:08:49] know what he's gonna do you're gonna say
[1:08:50] no I can't die I'm not gonna die he said
[1:08:52] someone chose in the grave didn't say no
[1:08:55] devil I got your answer buddy he's
[1:08:59] hiding from you God has hid him from you
[1:09:05] but he'll be back or she'll be back amen
[1:09:11] I love that we're joke says hide me hide
[1:09:16] me till the storm goes by hide me in
[1:09:20] other words put me in a place where
[1:09:22] nothing can bother me I mean you think
[1:09:25] they're worried about something in the
[1:09:26] sixth dimension you think they're
[1:09:27] worried there is no worry there there is
[1:09:29] no fear listen whatever is in that sixth
[1:09:34] dimension is the same power in this
[1:09:36] dimension that's something we go up
[1:09:39] there over there and we're over here
[1:09:42] they got the same Holy Ghost you got and
[1:09:46] they're over there waiting on us to cast
[1:09:51] out the fear you and I are the blood we
[1:09:57] read this last Sunday we are the blood
[1:09:59] by the spirit the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:10:01] his blood relation to him a blood-bought
[1:10:04] bride remember Adam and Eve like I said
[1:10:08] before take Adam and Eve and put them in
[1:10:10] a put them in a hospital and let them
[1:10:14] draw blood from Adam and go to the next
[1:10:15] room and draw blood for me do a DNA test
[1:10:18] and they'll swear that one person
[1:10:23] that's why we'll have a body locking to
[1:10:28] his glorious body but we got to believe
[1:10:32] that now look blood relation a blood
[1:10:37] ball bride no wonder she was led by the
[1:10:40] spirit there is a connection coming
[1:10:43] together there's a union coming together
[1:10:46] that's the reason I think today that the
[1:10:48] born-again listen the Holy Ghost filled
[1:10:50] people is connected with God and are led
[1:10:53] by the Spirit of God that's why they act
[1:10:56] so peculiar to people they've made their
[1:10:59] decisions they're going to go on out
[1:11:02] regardless if the rest of them don't go
[1:11:04] out they're going out anyway I like that
[1:11:06] don't care if this one walks this way
[1:11:08] listen don't care for I don't listen you
[1:11:11] got to come to a point to where if this
[1:11:13] whole church leaves a message are you
[1:11:15] gonna just leave and follow no there's a
[1:11:19] top post they don't keep you here I mean
[1:11:24] not here physically hearing this message
[1:11:26] because listen if the Holy Ghost can
[1:11:28] feed only on the word amen only on the
[1:11:31] word then if this is the word they kind
[1:11:35] of connect why the life is in the blood
[1:11:39] and the life is in the church the
[1:11:43] Christian that's born again by the
[1:11:45] Spirit of God that's the spirit of life
[1:11:47] blood relation to Christ the Spirit of
[1:11:51] Christ in the blood of Christ leading a
[1:11:53] child of Christ the seed of Abraham
[1:11:55] that's why they move peculiar you're a
[1:11:59] little bit elite that's one of the world
[1:12:02] thinks so strange of them let's go to
[1:12:04] the next one Christ is a mystery we're a
[1:12:06] distant lest
[1:12:07] last Sunday it by all rights amen all
[1:12:13] right watch redeemed by Christ the
[1:12:15] second Adam so remember whatever the
[1:12:16] first Adam lost its back I'm not saying
[1:12:20] it's coming back its back amen cuz
[1:12:25] remember anything that goes on this
[1:12:27] world like I was saying before about
[1:12:28] Hawaii in all those places anything's
[1:12:30] going on in this world is because of you
[1:12:32] and me
[1:12:35] birth pains this world is groaning to
[1:12:39] get back up right
[1:12:41] the animals are groaning to get back up
[1:12:43] right why cuz this is not subtle this is
[1:12:48] not supposed to happen
[1:12:50] amen I told them out in Arizona and I'll
[1:12:53] tell you you know we think we here we go
[1:12:55] let's compartmentalize this remember one
[1:12:57] thing's for sure once would we still
[1:12:59] live in this flesh body and man we still
[1:13:02] live in this flesh body and it's gonna
[1:13:04] get weak and it's going to get sick and
[1:13:05] it's gonna get different things don't
[1:13:07] worry about that it's just not so you
[1:13:11] wake up in the morning it's not supposed
[1:13:14] to be you eating a meal cuz you have to
[1:13:20] it's not supposed to be you doing all
[1:13:24] the other function that we don't want to
[1:13:26] talk about that should have never
[1:13:29] happened
[1:13:30] so put that out of the way don't worry
[1:13:33] about what why is my buddy don't worry
[1:13:35] about it don't worry about what your
[1:13:38] body's saying cuz remember it's always
[1:13:39] contrary to God always cuz it wasn't
[1:13:44] supposed to be
[1:13:45] but the groaning is from the inside
[1:13:46] wanting to get that man back a wretched
[1:13:50] man that I am you just keep going we'll
[1:13:51] read it later on
[1:13:52] that's Christ in the church today taking
[1:13:54] his wife back see the threefold mystery
[1:13:58] now God manifested in Christ Christ
[1:14:00] manifested in the church all together to
[1:14:03] bring back the original Adam and Eve
[1:14:04] again men and woman which are one made
[1:14:07] of the same blood and same spirit and
[1:14:10] everything else the church is the blood
[1:14:13] of Christ by the spirit because the life
[1:14:17] is in the blood
[1:14:18] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:20] that baptizes an end the body that
[1:14:22] recognizes only his body as Fletcher's
[1:14:24] word now look if you're already been
[1:14:26] baptized by the Holy Ghost if you
[1:14:27] already been born again what's he
[1:14:28] talking about I die daily it comes back
[1:14:31] to this right here you see that right
[1:14:33] there
[1:14:33] that's where people they they have them
[1:14:36] you know they have a brain burp you
[1:14:39] can't have all this and then get the
[1:14:41] Holy Ghost up here you got to have the
[1:14:44] Holy Ghost down here to respond to that
[1:14:46] thing that's
[1:14:47] bringing you up that's molding it
[1:14:51] together where you used to worry about
[1:14:53] something you used to have a temper lord
[1:14:57] I love it
[1:14:59] listen to me I love it when I see things
[1:15:02] that were wrong in my life and they're
[1:15:05] not there anymore now you need to
[1:15:08] realize that you said oh you're special
[1:15:11] you're a preacher please people Lord we
[1:15:12] have more problems than y'all do if the
[1:15:15] devil kills us he's got you
[1:15:19] hello
[1:15:21] what the devil gets us he's got you
[1:15:23] because you can't go no higher on your
[1:15:24] pastor you can leave him go somewhere
[1:15:26] else
[1:15:27] so Satan hates us I'm heat you know
[1:15:29] right now you know who's listening in my
[1:15:33] brain who's listening ain't nobody
[1:15:36] listening to you they're looking off
[1:15:38] into space they're staring off into the
[1:15:42] Holy Ghost we'll listen to what the Holy
[1:15:46] Ghost says every time the church is the
[1:15:51] blood so I don't worry about those
[1:15:52] things
[1:15:53] I really don't it bothers me because
[1:16:01] that's why you know it's why brother
[1:16:02] Brown had a complex he had a complex why
[1:16:04] the ever complex cuz he could see he
[1:16:07] could see who was not just think he
[1:16:10] could see and I'm not pointing to you
[1:16:12] sister well you I am he could know
[1:16:14] really he could see a black shadow come
[1:16:17] up out of a person they said man they
[1:16:19] ain't getting it
[1:16:20] or are they come and shake his hand
[1:16:23] and he knows there's a knife coming in
[1:16:25] the back I couldn't do it he's the only
[1:16:30] man on this earth that could ever take
[1:16:32] that and guarding you that that's why
[1:16:34] he's the Prophet amen he's
[1:16:36] characteristic you and I couldn't do
[1:16:39] that be honest
[1:16:40] that's the baptism how would you be
[1:16:42] looking out in the audience of people
[1:16:43] going you see this demon pop-up now you
[1:16:49] see the Holy Ghost too but you see this
[1:16:51] thing pop his head up you know he said
[1:16:53] you look like a bat or a cat or
[1:16:55] something like that you know her well I
[1:16:57] like the one where he I don't like it
[1:16:59] but remember he tried to describe one
[1:17:01] the devil's now I'm talking about the
[1:17:03] realm he lived in that what was it the
[1:17:06] what demon was it looked like the that
[1:17:08] old cartoon Ali he said some demon
[1:17:13] whatever it was looked just like that I
[1:17:15] told him he saw demons it look like that
[1:17:19] but now thank God you and I don't want
[1:17:24] to see that we see enough with
[1:17:26] expressions on faces don't need a don't
[1:17:32] need a black cat selling your shoulder
[1:17:33] when I conceive or this is what I like
[1:17:39] to sit the whole service me the Hmong
[1:17:45] people face the Spirit of God inside of
[1:17:46] you you're alive
[1:17:47] and at least it will respond at least
[1:17:49] say amen to something that's about
[1:17:54] giving the Holy Spirit that baptizes us
[1:17:55] into the body that recognizes only his
[1:17:58] body his flesh is his word like I said
[1:18:00] compartmentalize it only recognize you
[1:18:05] word for the day your word for the day
[1:18:07] is go to the statue of a perfect man
[1:18:13] these things are what required so that's
[1:18:18] a requirement in this age so we must
[1:18:21] come to the statue of a perfect man
[1:18:23] we must I'm just going to say it we're
[1:18:27] gonna have to see understand more than
[1:18:30] anybody
[1:18:30] even the Apostle even the disciples
[1:18:35] because they all look to a glass darkly
[1:18:37] they all looked and knew something was
[1:18:39] coming but here it is this is what they
[1:18:43] saw and it was it was you know Paul said
[1:18:45] I looked through a glass darkly but man
[1:18:48] group of people they can see clear why
[1:18:52] because we've got foundation amen
[1:18:58] all right let's go to adoption let's go
[1:19:03] to number seven let's read this and I
[1:19:04] want you to read we're gonna read this
[1:19:05] from then we'll quit this will be the
[1:19:07] end right here watch don't you watch but
[1:19:11] a real spirit-filled Church full of the
[1:19:13] power of God
[1:19:14] sitting together in heavenly places this
[1:19:16] is 1960 we should be further up the road
[1:19:21] sitting together in heavenly places
[1:19:23] offering spiritual sacrifices praises of
[1:19:25] God the holy spirit moving among them
[1:19:27] discerning sin calling out the things
[1:19:29] that's among them that's wrong
[1:19:30] straightened out and making it flat and
[1:19:32] level because why always in the presence
[1:19:35] of God is that bloody sacrifice now
[1:19:38] remember we went through it this morning
[1:19:39] you wasn't saved by the blood that's
[1:19:41] right you were saved by the life in the
[1:19:43] blood I mean but you're kept saved by
[1:19:46] the blood what that daily washing
[1:19:48] washing out all the trash like sister
[1:19:51] Sheppard's dreaming blasphemous name
[1:19:53] washing all the trash out being born
[1:19:55] again
[1:19:56] I died daily and all these things second
[1:19:59] Timothy Paul says if a man therefore
[1:20:01] purge himself from these he shall be a
[1:20:03] vessel unto honor sanctified and meat
[1:20:06] for the Masters use and prepared unto
[1:20:07] every good work that's pretty neat huh
[1:20:10] but you were saved by grace through
[1:20:11] faith believing it God knocked at your
[1:20:13] heart because he predestinated you you
[1:20:15] looked up and believed it and accepted
[1:20:16] it now the blood makes an atonement for
[1:20:19] your sins listen to this remember I said
[1:20:22] God does not condemn a sinner for
[1:20:25] sinning all right he's a sinner to begin
[1:20:30] with he condemns a Christian for sinning
[1:20:33] now look compartmentalizing you don't
[1:20:35] send in your soul you don't send in your
[1:20:38] body your body's just a product of sin
[1:20:40] it's only motivated by what's inside and
[1:20:45] then because he has condemned him Christ
[1:20:49] took our condemnation
[1:20:51] so there's no condemnation to them which
[1:20:54] are in Christ Jesus that walked out
[1:20:56] after the flesh but after the spirit and
[1:20:59] if you do anything wrong
[1:21:01] it isn't willfully you don't sin
[1:21:04] willfully now if you sin wilfully you're
[1:21:07] not born again that's what he says a man
[1:21:09] that sins willfully goes out and
[1:21:11] willfully sins never come into that
[1:21:14] buddy yet but a man that's once in there
[1:21:17] he's dead and that's what we're getting
[1:21:19] to that next seal the next seal is what
[1:21:22] black death all right and his life is
[1:21:26] hitting God through Christ he said why
[1:21:28] didn't
[1:21:28] did happen in this them in this church
[1:21:31] is part of it did but the death that
[1:21:33] we're fixing to talk about is not
[1:21:34] physical death
[1:21:37] I'd rather die physically than to be
[1:21:40] dead spiritually amen
[1:21:44] I'd rather be dead physically than to be
[1:21:48] dead spiritually because there's a lot
[1:21:49] of people that's dead and don't know it
[1:21:51] amen
[1:21:52] but a man that's once in there he's dead
[1:21:55] and his life is hitting God through
[1:21:57] Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost and the
[1:22:00] devil can't even find him he's so far
[1:22:05] back in there now what brother branham
[1:22:06] say said if you and the devil get into a
[1:22:09] conversation what have you done you have
[1:22:10] stepped out into his ground his ground
[1:22:14] is memory reason conscience affection
[1:22:16] imagination you've took him stepped out
[1:22:19] of the realm into his realm all right
[1:22:22] and the devil can't even find him he's
[1:22:25] so far back in there he would have to
[1:22:28] come out of there before the devil can
[1:22:31] ever get in for you or dead man you are
[1:22:36] dead that's what we're going to get to
[1:22:39] next the next one next seal we're coming
[1:22:41] to is the black horse death and we'll
[1:22:46] see how that all fits in the brothers
[1:22:50] and sisters that second seal is you dine
[1:22:55] you dine but let God do the killing
[1:22:58] let God kill that thing amen let's stand
[1:23:01] our feet
[1:23:02] let God kill that thing you know that
[1:23:10] song I surrender all you know we was
[1:23:13] saying I surrender on we do this you
[1:23:18] walk up to a guy with a gun and you say
[1:23:23] I surrender he's gonna shoot you because
[1:23:27] you're not surrendering he don't know
[1:23:29] what's in this hand but when you got
[1:23:31] both arms up and you got them palms up
[1:23:34] in the air it's a lot more safe to say I
[1:23:37] surrender because there's nothing else
[1:23:39] that you're keeping in hiding
[1:23:42] from God he loves Lord we gotta love his
[1:23:50] word we gotta feed off of it that's the
[1:23:52] whole thing on these seals it's not
[1:23:55] something that's just it's not
[1:23:57] mysterious folks it's just everyday life
[1:23:59] it's overcoming he that overcometh he
[1:24:02] that overcometh he that overcometh so
[1:24:05] you know what when God said you can
[1:24:07] overcome he put a provision in there for
[1:24:10] you to overcome whoa stop stop that's
[1:24:16] what we got to stop doing well he don't
[1:24:18] under
[1:24:19] don't tell me an eternal God don't
[1:24:20] understand what he knows what you gonna
[1:24:22] go through before you go through it
[1:24:24] there's no surprise he never has enough
[1:24:27] moment oh he never says well I shouldn't
[1:24:29] have done that to brother Donny know
[1:24:30] whatever happened to him if he's a child
[1:24:33] of God God meant for it to happen and he
[1:24:35] knew what would happen in the outcome
[1:24:37] that's what I have to believe that way
[1:24:40] you can go through problems in your life
[1:24:43] and you can say God I am your child
[1:24:48] don't don't don't
[1:24:50] God why did you do this to me why not
[1:24:53] forget that it's for a reason the reason
[1:24:59] he knows but remember one thing it's
[1:25:05] still your choice so I love what brother
[1:25:09] Dale said nothing long ago God knew
[1:25:13] every Avenue that you could have took if
[1:25:18] you hadn't have been this is that you
[1:25:20] understand predestination we say boys
[1:25:22] just thought pull you through a tube now
[1:25:24] brother Ram said that's not the way it
[1:25:25] was so it's not stamped sure in God's
[1:25:28] mind it is so they knew what you do
[1:25:30] before you did it but remember God's
[1:25:34] nose are the best yeses you will ever
[1:25:37] get but if you think oh god I got this
[1:25:40] thing figured out if I could just and
[1:25:42] you see this wall come up or God says no
[1:25:45] you don't need to do that
[1:25:46] you know what you can press yourself
[1:25:49] into it and make a foolish mistake but
[1:25:53] if you listen to that know that God
[1:25:55] knew that if you went on through with it
[1:25:58] that's why you need to pray about
[1:25:59] everything you do anything you do job
[1:26:02] life life family whatever because if God
[1:26:06] said no then he knows that you if you
[1:26:08] went down that path you would go wrong
[1:26:11] he can't let a child of God go wrong if
[1:26:14] you do it the right way you hear what I
[1:26:16] said one more time he can't let a child
[1:26:18] of God go wrong if you'll do it the
[1:26:20] right way go to God seek ye first the
[1:26:23] kingdom of heaven and all these other
[1:26:25] things what will be added to you let's
[1:26:28] see God bless you the second seal it was
[1:26:31] good I like sanctification it just gives
[1:26:33] you a good washing we come every Sunday
