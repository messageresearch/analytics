[22:48] out you know we you know we get ready to
[22:53] to have a gap and God's already got to
[22:56] fail you know so that's just the way it
[22:59] is he knew before the foundation world
[23:02] what we needed anyway so he's not
[23:05] surprised about anything what we were
[23:06] talking about this morning you know it
[23:09] how could God have fear he knows what's
[23:11] gonna happen he's already seen it happen
[23:14] how can you be afraid tomorrow we're
[23:16] afraid what happens because we don't
[23:18] know what's coming tomorrow or the next
[23:19] day but God knew it from the foundation
[23:21] the world what's coming so he has no
[23:24] fear but I'm gonna read you a quote here
[23:26] in a minute I read last Sunday where we
[23:27] are prophetic people so we should be
[23:29] able to have no fear we should trust in
[23:32] the one that's already been there the
[23:34] one that's already done it you know so
[23:36] good to be in the house of Lord let's
[23:37] turn to revelation 6 and go ahead and
[23:39] get started
[23:39] and it's not six one seven through eight

[25:23] revelation 6 verse 7 through 8 let's bow
[25:26] our heads before we get started the Lord
[25:29] Jesus we know Lord that without you here
[25:33] today it's just a meeting of of opinions
[25:37] and minds and and almost like a brother
[25:42] Browne said called the Church of the
[25:44] lodge Lord we don't want this to be a
[25:46] lodge we want this to be a supernatural
[25:49] happening today Lord that you break
[25:52] through Lord and reveal yourself to us
[25:55] through your word that you'll break back
[26:00] the scales from our eyes and Lord that
[26:02] you will help us to understand more
[26:04] about you father we pray that you'd
[26:07] forgive us of our sins and our many
[26:09] mistakes that we make Lord bless each
[26:11] one that's here Lord
[26:13] that are sick you said you sent the word
[26:15] and healed them and delivered them from
[26:16] their destructions the Lord his word
[26:18] goes forth we've seen it many times
[26:19] before that you'll heal them sitting in
[26:22] their seats Lord because they're
[26:23] listening to the Word of God Lord would
[26:26] pray that you just bless and take care
[26:27] of us be the ones that are on the
[26:29] highways brother John and sister my lord
[26:32] what a kindred spirit that we feel that
[26:35] we've had torn from us but Lord we we
[26:37] pray that you'd keep them safe get them
[26:40] back home Lord for with their family
[26:42] father be with each one take care
[26:44] brother the rest would be with him
[26:45] tomorrow Lord as he flies back home that
[26:48] we will get a good report from told him
[26:52] when he got here that we'd try our best
[26:55] to fill him up so maybe we can fill him
[26:57] up and he can go speak your word up to
[26:59] those people up there father
[27:01] we asked your blessings on this service
[27:03] now the words already anointed now I
[27:05] pray that you anoint us father give us
[27:08] this day our daily bread and Jesus name
[27:10] we pray amen revelation 6 verse 7 and
[27:13] when he had opened the fourth seal I
[27:15] heard the voice of the fourth beast say
[27:17] come and see and I looked and behold a
[27:20] pale horse and his name that sat on him
[27:22] was death and hell followed with him and
[27:24] power was given unto them over the
[27:26] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[27:28] the sword and with hunger and with death
[27:31] and with the beasts of the earth and you
[27:33] can be seated in the Lord at his
[27:35] blessing to the reading of the word
[27:36] we'll get started we won't need the
[27:38] chart today so I think we pretty much
[27:40] caught up on the chart as far as the
[27:45] church ages because I was reading last
[27:47] night or this morning earlier where
[27:48] brother Branham said that that's been
[27:51] vindicated the church ages have been
[27:53] vindicated all the messengers have been
[27:55] vindicated the messenger the message to
[27:58] the aged what's going on in that church
[28:00] age has all been vindicated even before
[28:02] the seals broke and then when the seals
[28:04] broke there they were that's why that
[28:08] God had to line the church ages at first
[28:10] before he brought the seven seals
[28:12] because they had to coincide our
[28:15] carburetor with each other they had to
[28:17] be like we're gonna read today a few
[28:19] things that happened and we've read in
[28:20] all the church ages when we have the
[28:22] chart up here so we're not gonna bring
[28:23] the chart anymore I think you understand
[28:26] that the rapture takes place on the
[28:28] fourth seal and it is in the seventh
[28:30] Church age first three ages first seal
[28:34] right Amen second seal the dark ages
[28:40] third seal Luther and Wesley fourth seal
[28:46] is the Eagle age which is our age right
[28:49] now that's what the rapture takes place
[28:51] on the fourth seal now there's three
[28:52] more seals to go and we must see the
[28:55] revelation of those all those like
[28:56] brother Dale will come up this morning
[28:57] Christ in on the seventh seal if Christ
[29:00] is not here we're not going anywhere
[29:02] that's the problem now you say well no
[29:04] yeah Christ is in you the hope of glory
[29:06] but there's more for us to get there's
[29:09] more for us to get or we would already
[29:11] be gone because when we get enough to
[29:14] get the Dead out of the ground then
[29:16] we're done here I said we're done here
[29:19] all right so and then God goes over to
[29:21] Israel but we must see these seals open
[29:25] you must see them for yourself you got
[29:28] to see it whether I see it or not is
[29:31] really no concern to you it just we need
[29:34] to all help each other that's why we
[29:36] have questions and we we have the Bible
[29:38] study there at downstairs for a couple
[29:41] hours and and we just kind of you know
[29:44] sit around informal and ask questions
[29:46] and they was one guy said one time he
[29:48] said well here we are Bible study and
[29:51] we're not a moment in the Bible well
[29:52] then you know we then we we titled it
[29:55] wrong maybe we should call it questions
[29:58] and answers of for anything because we
[30:00] don't really pick a scripture we used to
[30:03] but now that everybody's bringing
[30:05] questions in then we just have questions
[30:06] and answers so it's just a real nice
[30:08] thing to do and it's free some of it
[30:13] some of you'll pay and go see a movie or
[30:15] a car race or something but you won't
[30:16] come to Bible study so you know all
[30:19] these other things that goes on you know
[30:21] what I'm sorry but like would say right
[30:24] here the last plague to hit the Church
[30:28] of spiritual death that's the last
[30:31] plague that's the last one there's not
[30:34] another one spiritual death is it one
[30:37] spiritual death comes then then you know
[30:39] what
[30:40] did there's no reviving someone
[30:42] spiritually dead now physically dead the
[30:46] dead is going to come back but if
[30:48] they're spiritually dead they're not
[30:50] coming back to the white throne judgment
[30:51] and they're gonna have to be judged by
[30:53] their works amen so we want to be dead
[30:57] in Christ and man we want to be dead
[31:00] there's nothing wrong with being dead
[31:02] but dying to the world is what we're
[31:04] talking about not being spiritually dead
[31:06] because brother Branham he comes and
[31:08] tells us I think it I pulled up a quote
[31:11] that they don't have I was just looking
[31:13] it was on unveiling of God before right
[31:17] before the Exodus what happened right
[31:20] before Israel's exodus there was a death
[31:23] the Death Angel came through and killed
[31:25] all the firstborn a man but we are the
[31:28] Church of the firstborn so we are
[31:30] firstborn so we have to be concerned
[31:32] that not only the bloods over the
[31:34] doorpost and whoever that was it was
[31:36] preaching brother Danny and one of them
[31:38] was preaching on that and I thought well
[31:40] man that's good to have the blood but
[31:44] what I want to say is is because the
[31:47] blood was there there was a lamb in the
[31:50] house it was a lamb in the house and
[31:54] that lamb dying is what took their place
[31:57] and that's what you and I should never
[31:59] forget what Jesus Christ did for us
[32:02] sometimes we we you know we forget
[32:06] Calvary but we should never forget what
[32:08] Christ did at Calvary greatest things
[32:12] ever done by human mortal man and he was
[32:14] a human moral man but it was God
[32:15] Almighty and human flesh that man so in
[32:17] Joel 2 let's get started because we were
[32:19] talking last Sunday about coming back in
[32:23] four stages well what we've got to see
[32:25] then in this seal is is that we've got
[32:29] to see that you and I let me put it me
[32:34] let me put it softly nobody nobody has
[32:42] come to this till now that's why I want
[32:47] to put it softly
[32:48] yeah not be Christianizing anybody but
[32:51] nobody because remember
[32:53] and I'll read the quote in a minute
[32:55] after I read the scripture you gotta
[32:56] remember I will restore now when did God
[32:59] start restoring when we know when the
[33:00] day of Pentecost he started restoring
[33:02] the the church bride but it went back
[33:08] down so it going back down it's coming
[33:12] out on the other side to go back to what
[33:15] go back to the full-grain again and
[33:17] that's me and you that's not Luke so
[33:19] that's not Leslie that's not Pentecost
[33:21] that's you and I at this fourth seal
[33:24] because remember the fourth seal you and
[33:26] I somewhere in that fourth seal we've
[33:28] got to take a have a resurrection of the
[33:32] body change some were in there and then
[33:35] which is right now so I will restore you
[33:40] know many people are thinking this many
[33:42] people have read that and preached a
[33:45] restoration message all down through the
[33:48] ages but you know what they were doing
[33:51] they were looking for another day
[33:53] because they never come to full
[33:54] restoration but you and I have come to
[33:57] the full restoration when we come to
[33:59] that fourth beast that combat beast
[34:01] being the eagle that comes to a place
[34:04] that no one's ever been before even
[34:07] though they may have been thousands of
[34:08] sermons preached on I will restore and I
[34:10] can see some of them old you know free
[34:13] will Baptists and fire baptized holiness
[34:16] they probably jump up I will restore and
[34:18] they'll beat the pulpit I'm going to
[34:19] restore I'm going to restore they were
[34:22] just part of it they were just part you
[34:27] and I are the recipient of this
[34:30] scripture being fulfilled that great
[34:33] army I sent among you a master let's
[34:36] read this be glad they're children of
[34:37] Zion which is you and huh and rejoice in
[34:40] the Lord your God for he hath given you
[34:41] the former rain moderately and he will
[34:44] cause to come down for you the rain now
[34:48] what is the form of rain teaching rain
[34:52] all right brother branham you know
[34:54] that's why did brother Dale talk about
[34:56] this morning the latter rain people the
[34:59] latter rain movement was saying latter
[35:01] rain let it rain let it rain brother
[35:02] sounds like your teachings wrong he
[35:07] didn't really say that but that's what
[35:08] he was meaning you gotta have somebody
[35:10] to line this up and teach you the
[35:13] teaching rain has to come first and you
[35:16] don't even have your saying ladder rain
[35:19] you're saying you're already harvesting
[35:22] mmm they weren't harvesting they didn't
[35:25] know what to harvest they weren't in the
[35:27] same field that we're supposed to be in
[35:30] they didn't know what to harvest but
[35:31] when brother Branham comes he brings
[35:33] what the former rain teaches us that's
[35:36] what's going on now up to a point
[35:39] but remember the latter rain the former
[35:42] rain and the latter rain comes in the
[35:44] first month 30-day period
[35:46] you go from a teaching to a harvest well
[35:49] that can't happen in natural plants but
[35:53] it can happen to me and you a man that
[35:56] 11th island worker like this one sitting
[35:58] here on the front row that's just been
[36:00] listening for two years you know I mean
[36:03] but I was telling him the other night I
[36:04] said man you ain't going to go through
[36:06] all the junk that we went through I
[36:07] don't have to go through the junk he
[36:09] went through so we see the ones that
[36:11] went on before and just kind of cleared
[36:14] back you know the bushes so that we can
[36:16] see better they brought the former rain
[36:19] they brought the teaching rain and we
[36:21] listened and then now there's a harvest
[36:24] coming from that teaching rain there's a
[36:27] latter rain or a harvest and we're
[36:30] coming up here in October and November
[36:32] and that's how our harvest for this part
[36:35] of the country amen and one day God's
[36:37] gonna have a harvest he's gonna harvest
[36:39] but remember he's not going to harvest
[36:44] corn plant this this high was just
[36:47] tassel and I mean stalking to leaves
[36:50] it's a mature plant it's already come to
[36:54] full fruition and it's already brought
[36:56] the fruit and god's gonna harvest that
[36:59] amen and the floor shall be full of
[37:02] wheat and the facts shall overflow with
[37:04] wine and oil showing that the wine and
[37:07] all you got holy ghost in the
[37:09] stimulation of the revelation and I will
[37:11] restore to you he's talking to you today
[37:13] talking to you
[37:15] and me I will restore to you the years
[37:18] that the locust has eaten the cankerworm
[37:20] the caterpillar to Palmer my great army
[37:22] I sent among you and you shall eat
[37:24] implanting that's what we're doing now
[37:26] we're eating in plenty we've never had
[37:31] this kind of word to work under even
[37:34] with brother Branham here they didn't
[37:35] understand what he was saying but we do
[37:40] amen we do understand and you shall eat
[37:44] in plenty and be satisfied and praise
[37:47] the name of the Lord your God that has
[37:49] dealt wondrously with you and my people
[37:52] shall never be a shame let's just go
[37:55] over this just for a minute I feel we
[37:57] need to the Palmer worm remember what
[37:59] was the Palmer worm the Palmer worm was
[38:01] the first one though these are not in
[38:02] order brother Brennan puts them in order
[38:04] on restoration of the broad tree
[38:05] the Palmer worm is what the fruit so
[38:08] that's the first thing he started eating
[38:10] on was the fruit of the Spirit so Satan
[38:12] eats the fruit out of the out of the
[38:14] building then you started with what the
[38:18] locust next what does the locust the
[38:20] eats the leaves which is the preys which
[38:24] is the fellowship what they keep
[38:26] fellowship they're all in different
[38:28] ships Baptist Presbyterian brand of
[38:31] mites whatever you want to call them
[38:32] they're all in different ships the
[38:34] cankerworm which is eats the bark the
[38:37] bark is a covering which is a religion
[38:39] or doctrine all right and then the
[38:41] caterpillar actually sucks it to life
[38:45] but remember what happened was is it was
[38:48] eating down to a stump but it didn't
[38:50] kill the life because the life went in
[38:52] that root the Bible says I am the root
[38:55] and offspring of David amen so he was in
[38:59] the root and then what he was what I am
[39:02] the vine ye are the branches we're going
[39:06] to bear the fruit that's what's coming
[39:09] back but it had to come back if it died
[39:11] in four stages which it really didn't
[39:13] die it would just eat away it didn't die
[39:15] it was either way but to bring it back
[39:17] you have to bring it back in four stages
[39:19] now why that's why they had to be a lie
[39:21] knocks a man or an eagle for you look in
[39:23] the Book of Ezekiel there's always for
[39:25] you got four beasts that come in the
[39:27] line ox man an eagle
[39:28] to combat the four horse riders to
[39:33] combat what the four spirits of Satan
[39:35] that come into the world even the pom
[39:37] warm glow cos caterpillar in the
[39:38] cankerworm caterpillar that was four so
[39:42] with four def messengers that eat it
[39:44] away they had to be for life or life the
[39:46] messengers bring it back which is what
[39:48] we've been talking about in the seals
[39:49] justification sanctification baptism of
[39:52] the Holy Ghost and the word incarnate
[39:53] now I want to explain something to you
[39:56] about that let's stop from it he said
[39:58] well then Luther wasn't the word
[39:59] incarnate
[40:00] yes Luther was the word incarnate for
[40:01] his day but remember I want to read you
[40:04] that quote bring up that next quote if I
[40:08] get too loud borrow his earplugs yeah at
[40:14] least you can hear me say that that's
[40:17] alright I am a little loud sorry but
[40:19] what I'm going to set this box look this
[40:22] was so profound that a prophet would say
[40:25] I'm gonna set this box up right here to
[40:29] represent that if God sends a certain
[40:31] spirit among them that's the only thing
[40:33] they can work by is the spirit that
[40:37] works among them now will prove to you
[40:40] by the history of the church by the
[40:41] opening of the seals and the power that
[40:43] let loose and what's exactly the church
[40:44] respond to the anointing they couldn't
[40:49] do nothing else
[40:50] Luther couldn't do anything else but
[40:53] believe the just shall live by faith
[40:55] that was gardening Curnutt but that
[40:58] wasn't God couldn't work in completeness
[41:00] or in his fullness he could not work
[41:03] pleased to dwell in lucre absolutely
[41:06] pleased to dwell in let Wesley
[41:08] absolutely but like somebody out with
[41:12] you telling us about the Lutheran had a
[41:15] Lutheran priest woman somebody was
[41:17] telling us that the woman yeah and said
[41:19] her dress was so short well I'm not
[41:22] gonna tell you what happened but anyway
[41:23] this blue Turin woman is standing up
[41:25] preaching the Lutheran Church with a
[41:27] skirt that if you raise their hands you
[41:28] could anyway but now Luther did not that
[41:35] was had nothing to do with Luther
[41:39] that was all what happened after Luther
[41:42] left what that bug got in there and got
[41:47] to eating at that denomination they
[41:49] started what disfellowshipping
[41:51] Lutheran's has got it and the Westlands
[41:53] has got it and this one's got it but
[41:55] Martin Luther would absolutely well he'd
[41:57] try the church up if he saw that
[42:00] Lutheran doctrine from what he said the
[42:03] just shall live by faith to come to that
[42:05] that's what we've come to and that's why
[42:07] we want to speak today on on spiritual
[42:09] death because that's the worst natural
[42:10] deaths not bad spear for death is worth
[42:12] because if we keep living long enough
[42:14] who naturally where most of us are gonna
[42:16] die but you can be spiritually dead and
[42:20] sit right here amen so so Martin Luther
[42:24] had the word for this day but when we
[42:27] say justification sanctification baptism
[42:29] the Holy Ghost and the word incarnate
[42:30] that means that if God is excuse me God
[42:35] has come to a place to where there's no
[42:37] more there's no more denomination
[42:40] there's no more doctrine there's no more
[42:42] church age messenger there's no more
[42:44] group of people coming up this is it
[42:46] this is it this is the completion the
[42:49] fullness Auerbach's is look their box
[42:53] was this our boxes we're going home
[43:00] there's no more box that's going to be
[43:03] we don't have another you know we're not
[43:04] doing this now this is that this is us
[43:06] this is done there's nothing here we're
[43:09] going home
[43:10] alright but we got to get ready it's not
[43:16] just gonna automatically happen amen
[43:18] so let's go to number number two and
[43:23] just prove one thing here now the fourth
[43:25] beast that was sent forth we're gonna
[43:26] background a little bit the fourth beast
[43:28] that was sent forth to combat the
[43:29] Antichrist in this last beast are you
[43:33] ready the last beast that was sent forth
[43:35] or the last power to combat the
[43:37] Antichrist who was against the teaching
[43:39] of God the Antichrist was an eagle the
[43:41] fourth living beast was an eagle now you
[43:45] just study the ages study the scripture
[43:47] it's an eagle and in the Bible the last
[43:50] age was an eagle age and guard
[43:52] like in the Eagle to his prophet now
[43:54] watch the last days the Eagle aid a
[43:57] revealer of the true word in other words
[44:01] a revealer of all the word a man a
[44:03] reveal of a revealer not just of the
[44:05] just shall live by faith
[44:07] that was a box that was a church age but
[44:12] then God moved well what happened
[44:14] Lutheran's stayed where they were but
[44:18] God moved on into Wesley into Pentecost
[44:21] into the message of the hour and then
[44:22] we're going out of here but what
[44:24] happened with the Lutheran's they said
[44:26] well this is all we got and that's it
[44:27] until they stayed right there all right
[44:29] and they spiritually died amen let's go
[44:36] to number three now notice we find this
[44:43] fella here as an eagle this man this
[44:45] living creature that's poured forth here
[44:46] now or in other words there's four
[44:49] different ages of it there's an age of
[44:50] the line we find out that this being the
[44:53] fourth age and he said come and see the
[44:56] fourth mystery of the book of Redemption
[44:58] that's been hidden in this book so don't
[45:02] forget that the seals are for our
[45:04] Redemption not just to reveal the devil
[45:09] no it's for our Redemption but it's
[45:13] showing where he is amen John went to
[45:20] sea and he saw a pale horse and again
[45:22] the same rider upon this pale horse now
[45:25] he has a name called death now notice
[45:27] none of the other riders none of the
[45:29] other horses or no time that this rider
[45:32] ever rode they didn't have that man had
[45:35] no name but now he's called death it's
[45:39] not mentioned see he's revealed now what
[45:41] he is is death well how do we linger on
[45:44] that for a sermon and make it real plain
[45:46] how we could but anything that's an tyre
[45:49] that's against the real has to be death
[45:51] because there's only two subjects life
[45:53] and death all right so that's all we're
[45:55] talking about today there's two subjects
[45:57] life and death that's it and that proves
[46:00] that the Holy Spirit's revelation of
[46:02] this and this day is exactly the truth
[46:06] so we're living under the full truth of
[46:09] the of the of the age and then and the
[46:13] anti he's death because the word as we
[46:15] see it later on is life and this man is
[46:19] called death let's go to the fourth
[46:22] number four still in the fourth seal now
[46:26] it's not mention of the other times of
[46:28] this writer but since now it's mentioned
[46:29] that he's called death but under the
[46:32] revelation of the line now I want you to
[46:34] read this close I'll be sure he wrote
[46:36] that down under not under the revelation
[46:39] of the line age or the first day now
[46:43] remember that was part of it was
[46:44] revealed because Paul even said Grievous
[46:47] wolves are among you that different
[46:48] things you know that he knew there was
[46:50] an anti spirit among the people then
[46:56] John goes to Patmos and sees all the
[46:58] things happen and then he comes back and
[47:00] calls it the Antichrist he didn't say it
[47:03] was the anti devil he said it was
[47:05] Antichrist Amen so he knew what it was
[47:08] we were talking the other night you know
[47:10] John even admired we see these big
[47:13] churches and we see these big programs
[47:15] and we see these big things they're
[47:16] doing it's beautiful but so was Cannes
[47:22] Cannes offering was probably looked like
[47:24] you know a cornucopia of of colors and
[47:27] all the harvest and if you were standing
[47:30] there you go I might just pick this one
[47:33] instead of that bloody lamb over there
[47:35] squirting blood all over them you know
[47:36] the rock and Abel probably looked like
[47:38] he had been slayed itself you know but
[47:41] which one would you pick same thing but
[47:44] it's not by sight it's by what the word
[47:46] says amen now under the revelation of
[47:49] the line age of the first days the early
[47:50] age this wasn't revealed the next age
[47:55] was the age of the arts which is the
[47:56] dark age we just said that in the middle
[47:58] age the dark ages it wasn't revealed as
[48:01] what it was
[48:02] nor the man-like beasts of wisdom which
[48:05] is what Luther and Wesley Church age
[48:08] five and six trying to back up for I
[48:11] know this is we've done this over but
[48:13] they some here that had been here so
[48:14] we're gonna back up we're gonna listen
[48:16] we all gonna go together or we ain't
[48:18] going
[48:19] we all going together oh we're not going
[48:21] Lutheran Wesley and so forth it wasn't
[48:24] revealed but in the Eagle Age the last
[48:27] stage watch this now this is what I want
[48:29] us to see that we are in the Eagle lays
[48:32] the last days the prophetic age where
[48:35] there is to rise prophetic utterance now
[48:39] we know that utterance came from a
[48:41] prophet called William Branham but when
[48:45] he passed on he didn't take it with him
[48:49] he called us little Messiah he called us
[48:53] eaglets
[48:54] so whatever prophetic utterance he had
[48:57] is going to rise in a group of people
[49:00] and it's literally gonna bring that man
[49:05] out of the ground that who was gonna
[49:13] happy even the things we were talking
[49:16] about in the book of Romans you know
[49:17] Paul preached and prophesied many many
[49:20] things which are alive and remain and
[49:23] like my brother Dale was coming out you
[49:24] know they without us cannot be made
[49:26] perfect Paul was sitting there but Paul
[49:28] knew in his mind he wasn't gonna see it
[49:33] he knew he wasn't gonna say it but he
[49:36] was writing the very thing that we need
[49:38] to see so the same way with brother
[49:41] Branham he preached a prophetic message
[49:43] but preaching the preaching a prophetic
[49:46] message had to be to a group of people
[49:48] that was coming not the people that were
[49:51] sitting there a group of people that was
[49:56] coming not you you we are the recipients
[50:02] of this prophetic message so now you and
[50:06] I are not prophetic we're here we're in
[50:12] other words we're not prophesying of
[50:13] another group coming there's not brother
[50:16] Nels not standing up and saying you're
[50:19] not getting this this is not even for
[50:21] you this is for somebody else brother
[50:23] I'm stood up on the only question as an
[50:25] answer to the seals he said it's not
[50:26] even for you it's not even for you
[50:31] greatest message he ever preached he
[50:33] never preached
[50:33] anybody that understood it but you and I
[50:36] are here we are recipients of a
[50:40] prophetic utterance and receiving that
[50:43] prophetic utterance we get the benefit
[50:49] of whatever he preached we get the
[50:52] benefit of and like I said before it
[50:57] will get him out of the ground because
[51:01] he said rapture and faith lies in the
[51:03] books and tapes it just takes a fivefold
[51:05] ministry to put it together to put it
[51:08] together so that what so that that
[51:11] quickening power that's already there
[51:14] can work because we just read this
[51:17] morning in Romans 8 and says the same
[51:19] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[51:21] dead being you
[51:23] it'll also quicken your mortal body by
[51:27] that spirit that dwells in you well if
[51:29] you've got the new birth you've got the
[51:30] resurrection inside of you
[51:33] our problem is is we like to keep it
[51:36] wrapped in a cocoon of unbelief hey man
[51:40] yeah that's exactly right you a man or
[51:42] I'll just a man for you for those you
[51:46] there asleep I'll go ahead and a man for
[51:47] you two all right number five let's read
[51:51] this and then we'll make a few more
[51:52] comments hmm cuz this is all background
[51:54] we've this is probably the second time
[51:56] we've done this so so we're just
[51:58] background so watch see the writer the
[52:02] first place as an antichrist he was
[52:05] death to begin with when he started in
[52:06] his infancy when he started in back way
[52:10] back when when the Bible told her that
[52:14] it was just a saying yeah that was death
[52:18] because what happened was somebody
[52:20] believed that and began a new doctrine
[52:24] or a new something else right but it was
[52:28] not named death because it wasn't
[52:31] revealed at the time they had a box all
[52:35] right the Antichrist was death to begin
[52:38] with but he's innocent then sure he was
[52:42] innocent then he received a crown
[52:46] the crown the Pope a triple one and when
[52:49] he did then he United Satan United his
[52:52] church and state what under Constantine
[52:55] because he was over both of them then
[52:57] Antichrist was Satan in the form of a
[53:00] man now we find out his mystery here in
[53:03] this church and state the fourth stage
[53:05] of his ministry he's called the Beast
[53:07] first he's called the Anaconda we got to
[53:10] get through this then he's called false
[53:12] prophet and he's called the beast you
[53:14] know we find here being called as the
[53:16] Beast now I want you to notice this
[53:17] after the fourth horse in this fourth
[53:20] horse if you'll notice the first one was
[53:22] white then the next one was red the next
[53:25] one was black and the fourth one all of
[53:27] these other three were represented in it
[53:30] because pale is red and white and so
[53:32] mixed together it's all mixed in this
[53:35] one horse see there's become four or
[53:38] actually the three in one because
[53:40] remember there's not four stages of a
[53:42] new birth there's only three but you got
[53:48] justification sanctification the baby
[53:51] but the baby's got to grow right
[53:55] Satan the same way he comes from white
[53:59] to red to black to pale which he's what
[54:04] going to be incarnate in a beast kind of
[54:08] funny he incarnated the Beast and went
[54:09] in the garden and now he's going to
[54:10] incarnate a beast and take over the try
[54:13] to take over the world
[54:14] it began with codes remember that's the
[54:16] continuity of God Satan started his the
[54:20] beef he's going to end up as a beef he
[54:24] just had to deceive one woman back then
[54:27] see now he's deceived one woman the
[54:30] church but many members of that now
[54:34] right that's what he's trying to do with
[54:36] me and you he's trying to pull us over
[54:39] to just be one word off that all right
[54:45] all of these three were represented
[54:48] because pale is red and white and so
[54:49] mixed together mixed into one horse so
[54:52] don't get it wrong it's three-in-one so
[54:54] it's it's justification sanctification
[54:56] and baptism the Holy Ghost God incarnate
[54:58] God
[54:59] moving in human being same way with
[55:03] Satan white red black and Satan moving
[55:05] in a human being a man so that's what's
[55:08] coming up now but remember one thing
[55:12] here's a good little point for you to
[55:14] ponder if we go up on the fourth seal if
[55:20] we take a rapture then Satan is
[55:24] destroyed in us under that fourth seal
[55:28] Satan's destroyed in us now he's not
[55:31] destroyed he's still doing his work but
[55:34] remember I read you that scripture they
[55:35] laid Jesus stood one day and said the
[55:38] prince of this world has come and has
[55:40] nothing in me now we can say that and
[55:44] then tomorrow he's gonna make you prove
[55:47] it tomorrow Satan's gonna make you prove
[55:50] that amen
[55:52] but one day you know what he's going to
[55:54] try to make you prove it and it's not
[55:55] going to happen
[55:56] he's gonna try to make you prove it and
[55:58] it's not going to happen because
[55:59] remember he just keeps going and keeps
[56:01] going but watch this right here
[56:06] number six go the next one fourth seal
[56:10] now I want you to notice the four of
[56:12] them notice the off mark of four of the
[56:15] spiritual mathematics because God is 3
[56:18] this is 4 here is 4 here first
[56:21] Antichrist white second false prophet
[56:26] red third VY kyrov heavens and earth and
[56:29] purgatory black fourth the Beast that's
[56:33] for Pale Horse Satan being kicked out of
[56:36] heaven now we were talking about that
[56:39] the other night about heaven remember
[56:43] yeah heaven is a place because brother
[56:49] Branham said God's got a house he lives
[56:51] in a house he lives in heaven
[56:52] alright but I thought you and I were
[56:55] supposed to be in heavenly places if
[56:57] we're born again alright so it's not
[57:00] heaven to me as not the Bible even says
[57:02] heaven and earth will pass away but it
[57:05] took a prophet to come and line that up
[57:07] because the old denominational idea is
[57:09] that man God's just going to blow this
[57:11] universe away and we're going
[57:13] our brand-new well that's not Redemption
[57:17] that's replacement redemption is taking
[57:21] what's already here amen
[57:24] taking what's already here redeeming it
[57:28] and making it eternal man you ought to
[57:34] get them and that's just the plan of God
[57:38] that's just the plan but he took a
[57:40] profit though because every other
[57:42] denomination is anti against that every
[57:48] other denomination proves to you there's
[57:52] an eternal hell amen
[57:54] proves to you that we have to go through
[57:56] a seven-year tribulation right and even
[58:01] the the Catholics prove that there's a
[58:03] purgatory which there's no such thing
[58:05] but they prove it to you because
[58:07] somebody walked in it somebody's walking
[58:09] in it now but you and I though Satan has
[58:15] been kicked out of your heaven if you're
[58:17] born again Satan's been kicked out of
[58:20] your heaven you want to read it read
[58:26] revelation 12:13 Michael which is Christ
[58:29] fought Satan and cast him out of heaven
[58:32] when you're born again Satan is cast out
[58:36] of your soul is that all right oh no how
[58:41] was this eternal something well then you
[58:45] just take that Redemption out you if you
[58:47] always was you us I mean Jim we're
[58:53] talking yesterday or day before we do
[58:56] talk please
[58:58] day before yesterday we were talking
[59:01] about listen I said you know I said if
[59:04] this is how I hate this doctrine of the
[59:07] of the preaching of the seed because if
[59:11] I came here with an anything eternal in
[59:14] me different then even Judas Iscariot
[59:17] then on the day of judgment God being a
[59:19] just God Judas could walk up to the day
[59:22] of judgment and say God you can't send
[59:24] me to hell because you didn't make
[59:26] like that guy if you judge me you got
[59:31] judge him the same way and you put
[59:34] something in him you didn't put it in me
[59:35] so I never had a chance
[59:37] so you can't condemn me you see what I'm
[59:40] saying but Judas now can't walk up and
[59:43] say that because you and I were born in
[59:44] saying you and I were born just like he
[59:46] was we had the same choice he had Amen
[59:51] in the mind of God sure we were there
[59:52] sure we were a a word a seed word but
[59:58] I'm telling you people the things me and
[1:00:01] you did God wasn't nowhere around was he
[1:00:04] no okay alright thank you
[1:00:06] no God wasn't nowhere around I was an
[1:00:09] unclean vessel and he wasn't there but
[1:00:12] thank God he come in and burned all that
[1:00:14] old out and then I did realize that's
[1:00:20] what the sales to me it sure it makes me
[1:00:22] realize where I did come from the
[1:00:24] journey everybody wants to talk about
[1:00:26] the trail of the serpent I won't talk
[1:00:28] about the trail of Christ and man
[1:00:30] everybody wants to talk about the trail
[1:00:31] of the serpent weirdest herb well I know
[1:00:33] where the serpent was at one time he
[1:00:37] resided here I don't know about you but
[1:00:41] he resided in here but when he left
[1:00:44] that's one of the the first the first
[1:00:46] seal that first rider brother Brian said
[1:00:48] here stands a lamb and there goes a wild
[1:00:50] horse rider there was something riding
[1:00:52] away from that profit that was must have
[1:00:54] been there amen
[1:01:01] even Paul like we were talking about
[1:01:03] this morning Paul said the things I
[1:01:05] would not I do the things I do it
[1:01:06] wouldn't not not in his soul but in his
[1:01:10] spirit realm
[1:01:10] Satan was playing Satan plays with you
[1:01:14] and I in that spirit realm but when we
[1:01:17] realized that the one that's inside and
[1:01:19] deep down inside is greater than that
[1:01:21] that's our problem we think well no
[1:01:23] we're just a human and this is what we
[1:01:25] do no I can't accept that
[1:01:28] like I said I don't accept it is what it
[1:01:31] is and you said it yesterday about
[1:01:32] cringed it ain't what it ain't
[1:01:36] it ain't if it is what it is then we'd
[1:01:39] still be driving model life no it is not
[1:01:46] people you can change if you say it is
[1:01:49] what it is that means that you believe
[1:01:51] God just pulled you through a tube
[1:01:52] I thought brother Branham says what he
[1:01:57] predestinated by your desire not his he
[1:02:02] desired it all be say he predestinated
[1:02:04] by what you wanted Wow
[1:02:09] alright we got off the sub you hang on
[1:02:11] man let's go back number let's go to the
[1:02:14] next one remember these three things
[1:02:20] under this sealed death has to be
[1:02:22] destroyed because you know that's why
[1:02:26] listen the reason the people in the in
[1:02:31] the sixth dimension can't come to this
[1:02:33] dimension is because they're an eternal
[1:02:35] condition and that would make them have
[1:02:37] to come back into a place where there's
[1:02:39] death again is that right so we've got
[1:02:43] to have death destroyed here and it's
[1:02:46] only got to happen to one person to
[1:02:48] break that thing open one person one
[1:02:51] person Jesus stood up one day and said I
[1:02:53] am the resurrection and life he didn't
[1:02:55] need four or five Caiaphas and I eat it
[1:02:57] out he didn't need them to walk up and
[1:02:59] say we know he said I I am the
[1:03:01] resurrection and the life source only
[1:03:03] gonna tell you one person but what's he
[1:03:07] wants this destroyed then blaze just
[1:03:09] like a snowball effect you bring all
[1:03:11] their majors into this dimension but we
[1:03:13] can't bring them in this dimension and
[1:03:15] there's death they don't want I wouldn't
[1:03:16] hey brother branham even said have I got
[1:03:19] to go back remember when you went across
[1:03:21] the curtain time he said I gotta go back
[1:03:24] why because there was death in that
[1:03:26] dimension he saw his body laying there
[1:03:28] 50 years old dying but he was over here
[1:03:31] in an eternal condition I think that'd
[1:03:34] be a pretty easy choice but the angel
[1:03:36] told him you got to go back man because
[1:03:39] while he was prophesying it was a
[1:03:41] prophetic if you'll catch something
[1:03:46] you'll catch that God was showing us
[1:03:48] that
[1:03:49] death can be destroyed just in an
[1:03:52] instant because that's that moment at
[1:03:55] that split-second of time death was
[1:03:58] destroyed he was over here and then he
[1:04:00] had to go back into that other into the
[1:04:03] back into this dimension but at one
[1:04:05] period of time he was standing in
[1:04:07] eternity but that he turned but listen
[1:04:10] he didn't leave eternity there he took
[1:04:14] eternity back into this dimension and
[1:04:17] that's the same way with you you're an
[1:04:19] eternal person right now like Ernie says
[1:04:25] brother Villanueva he said you're a
[1:04:26] spiritual person having a human
[1:04:29] experience not a human person having a
[1:04:32] supernatural experience all right so now
[1:04:34] death has to be destroyed a resurrection
[1:04:37] has to take place and a rapture takes
[1:04:39] place on this seal now that's the waste
[1:04:41] that and look that's the order it's got
[1:04:44] to come death has to be destroyed first
[1:04:48] and like brother Dale said and I agree
[1:04:50] 100%
[1:04:51] I'm not looking for a rapture a rapture
[1:04:54] is an event because those other two
[1:04:56] things have happened but this is not
[1:04:58] going to happen before they happen this
[1:05:02] has got to happen and then the rapture
[1:05:04] can come and that's okay I mean you know
[1:05:12] people saying I'll see you in the
[1:05:13] rapture and if we never meet again you
[1:05:16] know that's okay but that's just like
[1:05:18] that song they sing when I die
[1:05:20] hallelujah by and by would that was you
[1:05:22] know that was wait a minute that was
[1:05:25] their box this ain't my box anymore my
[1:05:30] box is over here that says I ain't gonna
[1:05:31] die well this box says I don't have to
[1:05:35] these other boxes said yeah you got to
[1:05:37] die but this box I'm living in says you
[1:05:41] do not have to die I can't die even
[1:05:47] though I physically go leave this place
[1:05:48] I can't die but that death has to be
[1:05:52] destroyed by somebody not in a grave
[1:05:56] it's got to be live
[1:05:58] and you know what as long as we say we
[1:06:01] can't do it we become unbelievers right
[1:06:05] we become unbelievers of what somebody's
[1:06:09] already said was going to happen we
[1:06:11] which are alive and remain to the coming
[1:06:14] of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder
[1:06:16] those who are asleep right now we are
[1:06:18] not fulfilling that Scripture because we
[1:06:20] are preventing and hindering those from
[1:06:23] coming into this dimension why because
[1:06:24] we have not gotten death destroyed but
[1:06:26] we will we well but it will not come by
[1:06:30] these next parts that we're going to
[1:06:32] talk about the next part we're going to
[1:06:33] talk about spiritual death it's not
[1:06:38] going to happen in a denomination that's
[1:06:39] why brother Branham had to come apart
[1:06:41] apart from the denomination and tell us
[1:06:43] where Satan was tell us where we've
[1:06:47] always known where God was we really
[1:06:50] have I mean each each age had a
[1:06:52] born-again believer that knew he was
[1:06:54] born again new God had changed his life
[1:06:56] new God was speaking to him but they
[1:07:00] still had that one little spot they
[1:07:01] carried that little denominational I
[1:07:03] deal with them
[1:07:04] hello I mean really now we got now we
[1:07:08] know where that is we know the ride that
[1:07:11] Satan's riding like I said we hey
[1:07:13] brother I'm didn't have to preach the
[1:07:14] trail of the serpent we know where that
[1:07:16] happened we know the trail from Genesis
[1:07:18] all the way to revelations about what
[1:07:20] happens to the devil I just want to know
[1:07:22] where God is if you know where God is
[1:07:25] then you definitely know the devil ain't
[1:07:27] there because he can't stand to be in
[1:07:28] the same place amens all right now
[1:07:31] listen the symbols just to just the
[1:07:34] background the symbols are what a pale
[1:07:36] horse name was death pile was given and
[1:07:40] a fourth part of the earth fall
[1:07:44] so there's your symbols of the fourth
[1:07:46] seal so somewhere in there listen we had
[1:07:49] to be able to name him death to see the
[1:07:53] separation thereby getting this look at
[1:07:57] me the separation had to be that we know
[1:08:00] that that's death now because remember
[1:08:04] what we've called life what we've called
[1:08:09] life has been death
[1:08:13] yes we call come through denominations
[1:08:16] swore by you so I never was in the
[1:08:20] denomination I was always in this
[1:08:21] message well let's talk a little while
[1:08:24] let's talk a little while because we're
[1:08:26] still here
[1:08:27] amen so we hadn't got him old I demo
[1:08:33] ideas are not dead yet it'd be a good
[1:08:38] place for you to sit number 74 they'll
[1:08:43] notice fully Satan on his throne offered
[1:08:47] it to God offered it to our Lord
[1:08:50] remember he did when he was when Jesus
[1:08:53] was alive he took him up on the came up
[1:08:55] on the mountain took him up on the
[1:08:56] pillow of the church you know that's
[1:08:58] always that's always bothered me
[1:09:02] Satan was comfortable taking God to
[1:09:06] church let me say that one more time
[1:09:11] Satan was comfortable taking God which
[1:09:14] was Jesus he took Jesus and put him on
[1:09:17] top of the temple he's comfortable in
[1:09:22] church Satan is very comfortable and he
[1:09:25] don't sleep anyway here he is sitting
[1:09:30] here with this beastly heart in him now
[1:09:33] here is the person the beast the
[1:09:36] Incarnate devil now here's the point I
[1:09:41] want to make because realize one thing's
[1:09:46] for sure and what gets me is as you hear
[1:09:51] always a lot of denominations they know
[1:09:54] that Rome is the Antichrist right a lot
[1:09:59] of denominations know that but they're
[1:10:02] fixing to be all turned to it that's
[1:10:08] right they don't they just there's
[1:10:09] that's how deceived they are is that
[1:10:13] they'll they'll tell you boy that popes
[1:10:14] Antichrist and we know that that's the
[1:10:16] Beast and we know that that's the and
[1:10:18] they're just walking right into it
[1:10:21] because the Bible says he will rule
[1:10:24] he'll rule them all but they're there so
[1:10:29] they're against it now but something's
[1:10:31] going to happen that's going to turn
[1:10:33] them of course now we don't want things
[1:10:36] for sure there's going to be a group of
[1:10:38] people called a foolish virgin that's
[1:10:39] going to repeal that and get away from
[1:10:42] it and then they're going to be hunted
[1:10:43] down and killed but that's after we're
[1:10:45] gone right all right so he makes his
[1:10:48] appearing here on earth under the false
[1:10:50] pretense oh my goodness
[1:10:51] under the false pretense of the true
[1:10:54] word he associates himself with the word
[1:11:00] like I said before that white righteous
[1:11:03] church that was truly here in the first
[1:11:06] Street Church ages Satan didn't go in
[1:11:08] the barroom he got in that church he
[1:11:12] attached himself to that church same way
[1:11:16] when he got off of his white horse and
[1:11:17] got on the red horse he didn't ride in
[1:11:19] that direction no he kept right up with
[1:11:22] that sanctified Church then he kept
[1:11:25] right up with the Holy Ghost filled
[1:11:27] Church he associated himself with the
[1:11:32] word that's kind of scary but you know
[1:11:36] what it's not it really shouldn't be
[1:11:37] scared now because we should know we
[1:11:40] should know where he's at and what he's
[1:11:42] doing his whole tactic was revealed
[1:11:44] under those seals sure the plan of
[1:11:47] redemption that's number one
[1:11:49] but it did show where he was but see
[1:11:52] that shows me that I can be fully
[1:11:53] redeemed when I know what that guy is
[1:11:56] and where he's at and what he's doing
[1:11:58] and then what his tactics are alright
[1:12:01] number eight now we had him come in last
[1:12:06] night with a great sword to kill we find
[1:12:08] out that he gets killed with a sword -
[1:12:15] hey touchdown touchdown you can all say
[1:12:22] Amen and you can clap your hands do
[1:12:23] whatever you want do that touchdown okay
[1:12:28] we fire we find out he gets killed with
[1:12:31] a sword - you have to do that every once
[1:12:33] in a while the sword of the word now
[1:12:36] who's got it
[1:12:38] do who's got it
[1:12:41] this message made alive in a group of
[1:12:44] people the sword of the word God's war
[1:12:49] words sharp two-edged sword slays him
[1:12:52] puts him right down listen watch this
[1:12:56] wait till them seven thunders uttered
[1:12:58] their voices to that group who really
[1:13:02] can take the Word of God and hand it
[1:13:04] there amen
[1:13:07] it'll slice and cut they can close the
[1:13:09] heavens they can shut this to that
[1:13:11] whatever they want to glory because
[1:13:14] remember you know the sword went into
[1:13:16] brother branham's hand right it fit okay
[1:13:22] that's all right but remember later on
[1:13:25] his comment his comment was it was
[1:13:28] beautiful it was nice he said but it
[1:13:30] takes a strong hand to faith and know
[1:13:32] how to handle that SOI see we're the
[1:13:36] ones that know how to handle the sword
[1:13:37] and not that brother branham didn't he
[1:13:40] was the first-fruit he was the one that
[1:13:42] come to him first but you and I have to
[1:13:45] have a sword in the hand experience the
[1:13:47] our end has to fit the Word of God and
[1:13:50] you know what if there's going to be a
[1:13:52] group who really take the word have hand
[1:13:55] it they're slicing cut that's in you and
[1:13:58] me that we know how to handle it we know
[1:14:02] how to handle the word he will be slayed
[1:14:05] by the word that proceeds from his mouth
[1:14:07] is sharper than a two-edged sword
[1:14:09] it could call for a hundred billion tons
[1:14:11] of flies if they wanted to a man
[1:14:12] whatever they say is going to happen now
[1:14:14] he's talking about the two prophets but
[1:14:15] I'm talking about me and you because
[1:14:17] it's the Word of God coming from the
[1:14:19] mouth of God God always
[1:14:22] it's his word but he always uses man to
[1:14:26] work it
[1:14:26] God could call for them flies down in
[1:14:29] Egypt but he said Moses that's your job
[1:14:33] I'll just tell you what to do and you go
[1:14:35] do it he fully done it he could have
[1:14:38] chose the son to call him he could have
[1:14:39] caused the moon to call her the wind but
[1:14:42] he said Moses that that he chooses man
[1:14:46] all right so God choose man to do this
[1:14:48] so it's got to come through a man that
[1:14:51] all right
[1:14:52] now look let's go to the next one I want
[1:14:55] to read a scripture that they don't have
[1:15:00] so this is what's happening in this we
[1:15:03] read this in the theit iron age they
[1:15:04] don't have it so I'm going to read the
[1:15:06] revelations to verse 20 notwithstanding
[1:15:08] I have a few things against you because
[1:15:10] I'll have suffered that woman Jezebel
[1:15:11] which calleth herself a prophetess to
[1:15:14] teach and seduce my servants
[1:15:19] that's this day now I know what star
[1:15:22] Tyra
[1:15:23] that was their part they got but it's
[1:15:24] today that same spiritual life seduce my
[1:15:28] servants to commit fornication and eat
[1:15:30] things sacrificed in the idols I give
[1:15:33] her space to repent we've had sixty
[1:15:36] years to get this message together I
[1:15:40] give her space to repent of her
[1:15:42] fornication and she repented not behold
[1:15:46] I will cast her into a bed and then that
[1:15:49] commit adultery with her into Great
[1:15:51] Tribulation except they repent of their
[1:15:54] deeds and I will kill her children with
[1:15:57] death and all the churches shall know
[1:16:00] that I am he which searches the reins
[1:16:02] and hearts and I will give unto every
[1:16:04] one of you according to your works so
[1:16:08] now let's read this last list we read
[1:16:10] this quote right here number nine see
[1:16:14] the loving long-suffering of God now
[1:16:16] this is in the fourth seal because we
[1:16:17] got to remember spiritual death has got
[1:16:20] to strike before the Exodus
[1:16:23] spiritual death had to strike before
[1:16:26] Israel left Egypt there was all the
[1:16:30] different plagues but the last one and
[1:16:33] guess who called the plague you remember
[1:16:36] who called the plague Pharaoh called it
[1:16:39] Pharaoh called it Moses didn't Pharaoh
[1:16:43] said I'll kill every one of your
[1:16:44] firstborn Moses said you've called it
[1:16:47] let it happen
[1:16:48] but he never got to it because remember
[1:16:50] he was prophesying against his own self
[1:16:53] and God sent the death angel killed all
[1:16:55] of his clothes there was no blood there
[1:16:57] amen they didn't have a lamb you and I
[1:16:59] have a lamp amen
[1:17:02] before he passed judgment upon her he
[1:17:05] gave her a place to repent and it's in
[1:17:07] the name of the Lord I say this he give
[1:17:11] the Protestant Church the same thing and
[1:17:13] she won't do it now remember there's
[1:17:17] good people in them churches we've
[1:17:18] talked about this yesterday listen
[1:17:20] people live better lives than we do but
[1:17:22] that system is what's rotten that system
[1:17:25] has nothing to do with goddess of the
[1:17:26] devil because what's this he's give the
[1:17:29] Protestant Church the same thing and she
[1:17:31] won't do it these messages shook
[1:17:33] everywhere and she won't do it she's
[1:17:36] going to have her own dogmas and creeds
[1:17:38] I don't care how much you explain it
[1:17:41] like he gave Egypt he gave Egypt place
[1:17:44] to repent what was that last plague was
[1:17:47] death that's the last plague that hits
[1:17:50] the Pentecostal church it's spiritual
[1:17:54] death she's dead
[1:17:56] that's in the name of the Lord she's
[1:17:59] spiritually dead he gave her place to
[1:18:02] repent and she rejected it now she's
[1:18:05] dead
[1:18:06] she'll never rise again
[1:18:09] now if we believe brother Branham being
[1:18:12] a prophet that can't be broke they're
[1:18:16] dead
[1:18:16] spiritually dead everybody you hear
[1:18:19] people say I got the Holy Ghost I spoke
[1:18:21] in tongues but they don't want to come
[1:18:22] around to church like this oh oh you
[1:18:25] know I don't believe I want to go around
[1:18:27] the place like that and then say you got
[1:18:30] the Holy Ghost but you want your
[1:18:31] dignified way you want to stand babbling
[1:18:34] and still enjoy the blessings of heaven
[1:18:37] you have to make your choice you can't
[1:18:40] stay out there in the world and serve
[1:18:42] God at the same time Jesus said you
[1:18:45] couldn't serve God and Mammon so if you
[1:18:47] won't expect so if you won't expect if
[1:18:51] you really get saved you'll enjoy
[1:18:53] meetings where the Holy Spirit is
[1:18:54] vindicating itself and showing that the
[1:18:57] Word of God is so that all rights amen
[1:19:00] the last plague to hit the Pentecostal
[1:19:03] church was death spiritual death they're
[1:19:07] dead now let's read this one more quote
[1:19:09] number 2 him oh my notice he gave her a
[1:19:14] space to repent but she didn't do it
[1:19:17] he's done it again
[1:19:22] she won't do it her rejection away makes
[1:19:27] her or her rejection makes a perfect way
[1:19:29] for Satan to come into her and be
[1:19:33] incarnate incarnate himself right in her
[1:19:37] because she rejected the word and that's
[1:19:41] exactly the same thing that the
[1:19:43] Protestant church becomes a harlot is
[1:19:46] because she rejects the vindicated truth
[1:19:49] of the word of God and that gives the
[1:19:52] devil a place to come right in and
[1:19:54] incarnate himself and he will make an
[1:19:56] image unto the Beast when they can
[1:19:59] consolidate together right yonder now
[1:20:02] now this is 1963
[1:20:05] this is 1963 50 something years they've
[1:20:09] had to build this thing right over
[1:20:12] yonder and go on and do just exactly
[1:20:14] what he said that's right
[1:20:18] so the Protestant church has become a
[1:20:20] harlot and like I said before they
[1:20:23] they'll tell you and they'll tell you
[1:20:25] they'll tell you boy that Roman Catholic
[1:20:27] churches you know no but they're going
[1:20:29] right into it you see how slick that is
[1:20:33] they're going listen they're gonna
[1:20:35] worship an incarnate demon and think
[1:20:40] he's God
[1:20:49] see how bad that is let me read this one
[1:20:53] they don't have this they want to pull
[1:20:54] it up it's a token 1963 it goes let me
[1:20:58] tell you today paragraph 222 let me tell
[1:21:01] you today as his servant unless the
[1:21:03] token is on the door there is a
[1:21:05] spiritual death going to strike and all
[1:21:08] churches are headed back for the Council
[1:21:11] of the world council of churches they're
[1:21:13] all going back to Catholicism that was
[1:21:16] in 1963 right after the seals reprieve
[1:21:18] and only these who are genuine
[1:21:21] born-again is going to stay out remember
[1:21:25] not your Pentecostal denominations
[1:21:27] because they're already in it shows they
[1:21:32] are dead they are perished they
[1:21:35] sacrificed they went back they put him
[1:21:39] outside the door but he's looking for
[1:21:41] the token because the only thing they
[1:21:43] relied upon was speaking in tongues
[1:21:46] don't you rely on no speaking in tongues
[1:21:49] no nothing else but let the token itself
[1:21:54] be there the person listen the person of
[1:21:58] Jesus Christ can't be in you and the
[1:21:59] person of the devil at the same time so
[1:22:02] if the person of Jesus Christ is in you
[1:22:04] settle it people sadly then that you are
[1:22:07] God made manifest in another form you
[1:22:10] have you have come to a place that you
[1:22:13] are eternal
[1:22:15] those who he's justified he's already
[1:22:17] glorified and then the person of Jesus
[1:22:21] Christ you've either got the first you
[1:22:23] meet the got the person of Christ or the
[1:22:25] person of the devil one of the two amen
[1:22:27] but let the token itself be there the
[1:22:29] person of Jesus Christ his own life in
[1:22:32] you circumcise not just this that but
[1:22:37] circumcise your whole being till you and
[1:22:40] Christ are one Christ is in you and his
[1:22:43] life lives out through you let me read
[1:22:48] one more on unveiling of God 1964
[1:22:51] paragraph 157 since they spiritually die
[1:22:54] now they pull that up because watch I
[1:22:57] want you to watch this right here I just
[1:23:00] got these in the back of the one to have
[1:23:02] a couple more quo
[1:23:04] they spiritually die now this is a
[1:23:08] spiritual veil that was a natural veil
[1:23:13] this is a spiritual veil they keep
[1:23:16] walking on in behind there and you can
[1:23:19] tell them oh I know I know that but go
[1:23:23] ahead it's all right the only speech you
[1:23:25] remember the last plague in Egypt was
[1:23:28] death before the Exodus the last plague
[1:23:32] on earth this earth it's spiritual death
[1:23:37] before the Exodus then they'll be
[1:23:40] cremated
[1:23:42] they'll be cremated and turn back to
[1:23:46] dust and the righteous will walk out
[1:23:48] upon their ashes but the last thing is
[1:23:52] spiritual death rejecting the word amen
[1:23:56] that's the last thing to strike the
[1:23:58] church the last thing to strength it
[1:24:00] lice plague you want to have a plague
[1:24:02] that's the plate it's spiritual death
[1:24:06] don't worry about the Flies in the fleas
[1:24:08] and the frogs and all those things
[1:24:09] listen we're gonna be out of here we're
[1:24:12] gonna be out of here but that last
[1:24:14] plague is gonna fall while Israel was in
[1:24:16] Egypt the plague fell that's what's
[1:24:20] happening now the place is falling on
[1:24:24] the church and I ain't talking about
[1:24:26] just a method to send the Baptist and
[1:24:28] the Pentecostal because it'll deceive
[1:24:38] the very elect if it were possible close
[1:24:43] we know it's not possible but it's gonna
[1:24:46] be close so you and I must be in the
[1:24:49] forward know on this fourth seal we see

[1:25:14] physical building but
[1:25:16] come to the presence of the full Word of
[1:25:18] God and then turn it away I don't care
[1:25:19] for their brand of minds I don't care if
[1:25:21] they believe this message 50 years if
[1:25:23] they walk up and reject any part of the
[1:25:27] message any part will you just fill in
[1:25:35] the blank because I'm not going to but
