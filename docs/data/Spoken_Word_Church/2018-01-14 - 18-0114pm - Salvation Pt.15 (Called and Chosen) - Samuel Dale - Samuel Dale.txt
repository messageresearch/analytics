now we have the sheets for the church special singing now okay there's one here one in the back one downstairs for the special singers you know the ones who put your names down on the list that want to sing alright now if you would it'll be there so you be prepared you go by and look at the thing and see when you're supposed to be singing and you say well I just wanted I want to sing when I want to sing well I don't want to preach when I have to breathe either so we will count slutting out so I may be all right but uh you know it is set up in it's like it's every Sunday so much for each one and doing coming down so you know remember that trying to get it to where we'll have two singers on the Sunday afternoon you know into the group sometimes singing okay so to be down stars please look a week or so ahead of time and get yourself ready and don't wait for brother Louise to have to come to you to save the Sunday afternoon you know you be ready and everything but then if he has to he's got a list he can go by and say well okay you're scheduled to sing next Sunday or something like that to work that people can be ready like a week ahead where they can decide what they want to sing in times over make sure you do that now that the sheet will be down there and you look and see when your name own it in the things and then if somebody you're gonna be out we can swap it around and swap it to different ones in doing it okay so make sure you do that any other announcements everything else is announced you have any father we thank you for this day in your grace truly your grace is sufficient for ever need that we would have forever a thing that would be to us that we would have reason to even exist for anything would already be taken care of in you if we just believe it because you give us breath you give us health and life and strength all things coming from the father above we love you and we thank you and we ask you to just bless now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts you just have your way forgive our sins be with those that are traveling Lord and just bless each one member Ryan and him and remember wait and remember June she's over her dad sometime and friend that the Lord would bring all of these back safely to where we can be all together in you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Jonah tube but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the feast and in vomited out Jonah upon the dry land now let's go to Peter 2nd Peter 1 and we're going to jump over from a normal run of using this scripture and pick up just a thought because it will fit in to help us later but it bring into talk to of what we need okay first Peter 1 verse 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure free if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembers of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth amen so you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word know I hear a fan running but it must be running heat rich we can get it changed to click it a little bit anyway make it work oh now there's going to be hard to get to this position of using this scripture but it will fall into the line but it's dealing with making sure you know and in an entrance it's made into the kingdom for you etc okay now we studied this morning about the fact of ending of the Old Testament bringing in to the New Testament and that being the Old Testament the plan of salvation was back there and that we don't have to change any plans from the old to the new because it's the same salvation but just further advanced if everybody following me along in that line that it's an advancement it's not an addition it's not something that is it was back there he was spoke of back there he was brought out through the Old Testament so much until a lot of times they would you know stop the waters they would kill the lines the buyer the different things through faith to be in that position you know in showing salvation was there and that it had a position to her that when you passed away that you would have a place to go to are those people you know the Old Testament so then dealing with salvation in the Old Testament what are we to look for in the new not a different thing just further advancement you know advancing them more into what we're talking about because there's only one salvation there's only one faith one Lord one baptism there's not a lot of different salvation that's what we were talking about this morning that the prophet of God said that there was 900 different churches and he said if you ask those churches what it means for you to be born again he said each one of them would have a different way of expressing the new birth to them are being born again uh-huh so then you know we know that it can't be all of that but we know also and we don't discredit we know that people how truth and they've had truth down through time and things like that and they still have truth they're still in a way you could say that the churches are still serving God and brother Branham now has no trouble calling them Christians now you study the message from that line he has no trouble calling the Baptist Christians which I hold no they're not Christian he had no trouble calling the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostals whatever and would say Christians he has no trouble with calling them brother he said I'll even call the Pope brother hmm go see that would be part of the Word of God cause he is my brother right and we were all this brothers oh no we're not brothers I'm I'm writing you back well that's you got a lot of sense in haven't you we're all come from one blood coming down god made of one flesh all mankind you know and brought it down all right now but that was what we were talking about this morning just labeling it toward these two messages these are wedge to put in to carry us from the Old Testament salvation that we've been dealing with deliverance you know the things that happen to come into a New Testament form of salvation all right and then I'll keep saying it over and over then you can't have one salvation back here being under one way or something and then this over here being under another way it can't be it's further advancement we believe now come on we believe that there was a day that the Lutheran's had the truth and were the people of that day you agree well you don't want that salvation you know what they're in the Bride of Christ you know whether you want to believe it or not they're part of the body of Christ then you move up to the badness to the different churches coming down and at the time they were the people of that hour the bride of that hour and they had the salvation for that hour but what was it from the Lutheran to the Methodist serginho movement it's just a further advancement the Prophet said unless the hello that he said the Holy Ghost and justified the lutheran sanctified the methodist baptize the Pentecostals is now sitting in order to coming of the lord further advancement of the same salvation all right now don't lose that because when I get into the Lord willing next week and start coming down to very very basic simple elementary doubts see then you're gonna try to run over here you're gonna try to run over there and if don't don't do it just stay with me and when it's all finished in you cloud on the really well okay that's like I told him one time with having this ministers meeting I said at least you could tell me you don't agree with me what I said you won't you go out tell everybody else you don't agree I said you're right here now I'm gonna tell you I don't agree with y'all well there was one brother out of the crowd raised his hand he said I want you to know what I don't agree we I so I appreciate that and never offended me none whatsoever you know all right but now listen the to be born again is to be born from above to come from where Jesus came now we're gonna read a scripture right here to show the scripture verifies that clearly to our understanding and if we would just read all the scriptures that away I just picked this one I was gonna use it as a scriptural you know to read to start with but I thought no there's so much in that one scripture that verifies our talks about the things that I want to talk about this afternoon all right because what we're going to do now we know that there was a salvation in the Old Testament okay now we've got that but we know that salvation in the Old Testament was looking forward to the new right see Jesus Christ died for the sins of everybody where it be Old Testament New Testament all right are we in the Word of God that's the truth now so he died for the sins of everybody died once for all all right now and then what he done he brought it over into a situation so it was necessary as we were trying to express this morning now that he was our kinsman not just kinsman redeemer to just be a redeemer to redeem ourselves but to be our kinsman all the way until he would be glad to call us according to the scripture cause his brother all right he literally became human the prophet said to take away the human sin all right and see he was saying when he said to Nicodemus you must be born again Nicodemus couldn't understand that he says you mean I gotta go back to my mother's womb to be born again and see he couldn't understand that we're gonna read a scripture here in a minute and you'll see that a lot of times the people could follow Jesus up to a degree see Nicodemus could go with him to a certain point but then it would just stop because it required more than to just simply believe it all right now so you must be born again means you must be born from above the only way we can get any new birth that would be worth anything is to come from above Jesus constantly spoke of us saying this morning is my kingdom was of this world my disciples would fight my followers he said but it's not of this world he said I'm not of this world and then what did he turn around later saying to the disciples he said you're not in this world right he telling those disciples what was coming in to them was going to set them aside just like he was to not be part of this situation but to have to live here exist here and do all the things but yet not be part of this world all right now in doing that then it would bring us to the position as we covered with the Book of Ruth that she talked to her that was talking about she had to have a kinsman right the devil was the one kinfolks to us and it was our in the parable with the one that he had built boys had to deal with all right and as he dealt with that then he purchased Naomi and got Ruth all right now in doing that then it brought in the Gentile dispensation because Ruth being a Gentile he brought in the dispensation of the Gentiles now watch what I'm saying and you'll see this will go with this if we keep following it then the salvation back tyre was not just for the Jews only it was for those that believed that's a simple it life it was for those that believed ever that's too simple cuz we gotta get it yeah yes say in the morning you gotta get your linen sheets ain't you you gotta get your lineage in there to get something tied up well I'll just have a decency I wish you'd go back and study the Book of Ruth as I was trying to bring out this morning Ruth and Boaz gets married produces a child the child doesn't go to the lineage of Boaz it goes to the lineage of may Helen of how you pronounced Roose first husband to carry his lineage on and from there comes yes in in the you can't do anything with those lineages you're gonna run aground every time you try because somebody's gonna be smart enough to read the word and say now what you gonna do the lineage don't go to that the lineage don't go to marry the Linney's goes to Joseph in coming down to Jesus and certainly we know Joseph is not the father of Jesus now listen then getting to that at point that he had to come now how many times and we need it over the Prophet that God came himself he didn't send a son he didn't send a prophet he didn't send somebody else God came himself no so God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself so there when that little baby was born it was born a human baby you know sixteen elements you'd call it but it was created why but it was born a human being our brother all right but his soul and his spirit was Almighty God according to some of these great Revelator's now in the message they say that Jesus wouldn't God till the River Jordan well I just forget it I can't get away from what scripture said scripture said he was born Lord to Christ so that's enough to settle the problem you know but it ain't going to because people are going to continue on with their thoughts as they believe it alright but now listen then to take the scriptures and see that Almighty God came to earth and he came to earth to not only pay the price and then slower listen he didn't come to just pay the price that was all that was a big thing right he came to make a way that his kingdom could come in to mankind is that simple enough he came to pay the price to clear the debt but he came to Mecca way did he come to live in mankind wanna see then it would be necessary not only that God Himself come not another person but God himself would have to come to the earth and then as he came to the earth see that one that we called Jesus would be Almighty God in human flesh there's life in the other day / Richardson you know my phone has got 2 or 3 things in it and there's one picture like this you know the hoffmans kind of in on that style and and little Lily she was sitting there and she was looking at it and I said Lily who is that she said that's Jesus okay you think it don't dwell in their hearts and minds and different things now come on now sit down a little bit she flipped through another part of it and it had the picture that's outside in the hallway of Christ standing in the seven golden candlesticks and the things around you know like that it doesn't look that much like Hoffman's right and I said Lily who's that she says that's God no she's thinking more and I'm thinking huh she said that's God well in a little bit we asked her again she said that's God in Jesus she was getting it together you know then he's these little kids might know a lot more than we think maybe we never let them talk let's listen all right it means then one from above to bring Redemption to earth the one on the earth would have to take that plan and bring it into reality and make it manifest die give his life so that he could come back in you and I not as we used to think about the Trinitarians you know and our our God in three persons thoughts that God come to make away you know we'd say that yeah God come to make away for Jesus to come and bring the Holy Ghost and get it in we don't understand it but we believe it believe what but you see that very spirit that was in that man that walked the shores of Galilee is in you and the new birth or you don't have any birth and that spirit that's in you and the new with an uber has got to be the soul of Almighty God so we're not trying to divide soul and spirit when it comes to Zara now when we get down to in the message those things are going to be very valuable they're not to try to divide because anytime you divide you conquer right that's that's what divisions are for I never didn't learn too much about it in school but I didn't know you could divide a little bit all right now so I want to read I want telling to pull up and let's read this before we get started and then we can get into the message we pull up number one from John 6 and I want you to just follow with me and watch the life of Christ his purpose how he was God coming to earth coming to give his life call you and I and bring us to salvation huh see just reading the Word of God now watch what he said I love this scripture of always like this one you know verse 28 he said then said they unto Him what shall we do that we may work the works of God what can we do that we can work the works of God you know evidently in their mind in his message that he was bringing to him and talking to him he had stirred enough part in them too for them to think about doing the works of God you know and see we said well the works of God is to heal the sick cast out Devils and all of that's part of it but that won't bring you to the full meaning alright so watch what he says jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that you believe on Him whom he has sent now we know he didn't send somebody he came himself right so we're not changing the scripture to say to believe on him who came forth he why we're not dealing with trinitarianism know we ought to be above that day now look they said unto the him what signs show us now then that we may see and believe thee what does that work they didn't get a thing in or elysia right he's talking about the works of God which would include healings and signs and wonders and things right but it would have a meaning somewhere that would pick up enough until they wouldn't be getting what he's talking about I'm trying to illustrate you get down here in a minute you'll see this group of people just like Nicodemus they never did understand what Jesus said they said what can we do that we might work the works of God he said just believe me we know what he's saying I'm in a plain language wouldn't it just he's just saying you just believe me cuz I'm doing the works of God cuz I am God then they say it what sign sure some kind of a sign that we may see and believe thee man's always wanted some kind of an evidence or a proof they never got what he was talking about he was simply saying you believe that I am he that's the works of God not great signs and wonders that goes with it because that's part of the deal but the main part of the deal is whether we believe in God or not okay we're gonna hit the old testament heavy with that to bounce over huh not worse what does that work what what do you do that we can believe you're doing the works of God I believe you come from God I believe that you are God they surely had trouble with that one now look what say it our fathers did eat manna in the desert and it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat they're saying then jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven see they wanted a sign he goes to the word are you looking read the Bible why don't you sit down sometimes just read it like that and look at it and just didn't say what in the world is this talking about they're wanting signs he's saying to believe is what you need to do they saying what are you saying then what kind of sign can you do that we believe you then they begin to get real you know they said in him Burleigh where I said Moses gave you not that brilliancy they said Moses gave us a bring Moses never gave him no bread then what but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven little words where I come from naturally the bread fell out of the sky okay for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world now he's telling him who he is and what his purpose is and the Old Testament to be fulfilled in him because the manna back there was just etat right look they said unto Him Lord evermore give us this bread no one who were least on that they think he's talking about naturally right I mean evidently cuz they go to natural food jesus said unto him them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I said unto you that you also have seen me and belief not with Nicodemus cause he couldn't understand a new birth could they understand anything there that he was talking about to them continue on listen all that the father hath given me shall come to me now isn't he explaining the 40 come far to come to get the children of God bring salvation right or were you with me all that the father has given me she'll come to me in him that coming to me I will in no wise cast out look where I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me now what he come far that's what he's just saying I come down to do the will of my father the one that's in you because one that's in him was when it was any then watch him and this is the father's wheel which is sent me that all which he had given me I should lose nothing but raise it up again at the last day now he's beginning to preach a little predestination yeah we won't go into very much but that's pretty well what it's doing right and what and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone would see it the son now watch him that ain't enough to just see the son watching and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I'll raise him up at the last day to everyone that see if the Sun and believe on him okay what does it come up to be everlasting life do you understand what I was trying to get at that's the next one it's coming up so they can hold it up first time do you understand what I'm getting at we were talking this morning that he came down from heaven now he's telling you why he came from heaven to do the will of the one that sent him in other words I've come to die the only way you'll ever understand what I'm talking about is for me to die and just like he said to Nicodemus Nicodemus you can't understand what I'm saying unless you get born again yeah we oh we know all of what he said we understand do we understand mentally or spiritually you know you can understand mentally and know all mysteries not how the truth of it but we claim to believe but do we believe oh I believe I like the one that said Lord now help down my unbelief now think about it he told our in the scripture what he came to do it's just said it in different words and different things but it's right there in the message he came to pay the price the scripture we read he came to do the will of the Father pay the price give his life Frank Christ bring the life into us if we'd only believe it now look what he gets to go ahead with the next one John 6:44 no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me now had the father send him he come down when in him draw him and I'll raise him up at the last day so there's no New Testament salvation except that first be a calling or a drawing it's not that for everybody right oh yeah we know it's not for everybody that we received it with everybody ain't gonna receive it so it's not our for everybody if we realize whether we're called or not we realized whether he's drawing us or not then we'll strike it when we get to over in the message that got him laid one or two in there now but right here that word talks about you know that were chosen and the Prophet said now you didn't choose him sit according to the Bible he chose you so we've got a pretty little bit of predestination sitting in our way but we won't try to express it because we preach predestination enough to you over the years if you don't understand that you're gonna miss it anyway but just think about it no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him let's get the next one why we had it John 14 early year she excuse me jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life and no man can cometh unto the father but by me are you with me now he's saying no man can come except to father drawing now he's saying that no man cometh unto the father but by me right do you get it you flip-flopped pretty right see salvation dinner the New Testament is not based upon what we think oh we just join a church we shout with ready to deal with it it's based upon whether we're called or not whatever now that that gets into pre determining you we've got a few more scriptures in here that there's many called the fewer chosen you remember Judas the guy you remember Judas was chosen you remember Judas had part of the ministry remember Judas had two healings and the signs and the wonders remember Judas was chosen of God now we're in the Bible do you find any were any other disciples you know even in a basis of a great meeting happening you know just an area where what'd you call it the gold fancy words I like them you know that everybody's don't know what they mean but you know that there's a great big meeting going on and and the disciples go walking through the meeting and then they see him and do it and they follow him nothing in the Bible and anything in the Bible in the Bible they're out fishing they're out making the living he goes by and called them right he goes by and calls them Peter yeah sure didn't do a good and get Matthew in you know who Matthew was tax collector was short of a bad time of the year to bringing that up tax collector and what about now that he would even choose Judas knowing what he would do now you need the Bible cuz it said he knew from the beginning like you Judas was you need the scriptures to be put with it you're supposed to be reading your Bible right if you reading your Bible then we shouldn't have any trouble with words all right we see down what happens we can't come unless the father draws us the father and the son has to be the same person because you can't come as the son don't call you know so that's the same person calling you does that solve that problem too scriptures it looks like it's saying one that's waiting one that way and they're both simple if he just realized Jesus was Almighty God who was it called those disciples Almighty God said come follow me that was Almighty God walking the shores of Galilee see no man can come to the Father except by the son no man can come to the son except by the father we don't want that that means that means the father and the son the same person right if not then you got back to your Trinitarian concept okay that's what I said brother I said it'd be easier if everybody understood the one that's at the Godhead it'd be easy to preach but see we look at things and thinking about it and we try to figure out whether we're caller or not we're gonna get down in a minute how you know whether you call it or not but just follow me through the scriptures and just think about it what happened to you somewhere down the line in your life somewhere in some part of your life you had a contact with God if you didn't you might need to try to find a contact that's the best way of putting it but that's all right you know but can you remember where God started dealing with you you never was searching for God oh I cried and I prayed you and I love the Bible where it's got the answer the Bible says the goodness of God is what leadeth thee to repentance so that solves that problem if there's anything whatsoever in a line of what you think was for this or that or the other that caused me to come to the Lord just remember that Scripture that was the goodness of God that leadeth me to repentance they wasn't what we could do yes what brother dare you don't understand I cried and pray I spent two years in this message after coming in this message I prayed and I cried I fasted I've done everything to try to find what I needed until one day I come to find out by the roundabout way that brother Moute said it to me he said I know you're not looking for any evidences because I know you you you know we'd been together a long time - you're a lot of study together he said I know you're not trying to find any signs and wonders he said but I don't know what's wrong I said I don't either if I did I get rid of it he said well you just quit trying to find something and said you accept God that sounds like a bad fish we'll see that wouldn't Allah say it he said you start searching God in the world to approach him from the word and for two years of tozi I spent day and night studying the message and a wonderful job at work darling brother colleague in very five set up there with him for hours and hours day in and day out reading or talking was about the Word of God one day I read six books and I listened to two tapes in one day one to work one back home your thought about the doing that like I had because that's what he said to me he said you're searching for some kind of something what said quit trying to do that instant except what the word says I said thank you lord I'm not okay that's all it took well I fell one when I fell the other o hollyhocks down in Athens Georgia rut Road an old drunk was right to iron peg he fell over one way no drunk was sitting there looking at her and she fell over in the glade he's come up and covered her up with her with us something you know a blanket or something and that old drunk need isn't looking how I remember it now I get he thought what in the world's going on around here you know but you know what I kind of believe he finally got through to me no there are no problems in because see when I get to work this over here is that tells me that I know see there know how no problems but let's get to point out of the way of one thing we can't start the New Testament any different from the form of using in the Old Testament and is it true see now in the Old Testament it was God searching for man no come on show me anywhere any Bible anything of the Old Testament or anybody or the New Testament about people seeking for God it was God seeking man God come down and spoke to Abram I said get up and go there was always God searching for man what did the Prophet say that it wasn't Adam in the garden running around hollering gone God where are you he said it would God running around saying Adam were you so the Old Testament form of salvation is based upon the fact of us believing that God is doing the calling the New Testament will have to come with the same form he went to the disciples he said Peter come James come John come Matthew he hand-picked those ones to be his disciples and even chose Judas so he must have had a light for what he was not just the fact that he knew he was going to be the portrayer he must have been a pretty good guy because nobody in the group knew about it but Jesus right nobody knew that Judas and what he was but Jesus so he must have been are you calling the man of the year alright so then if we can realize from the Old Testament or New Testament that it's dealing upon God calling us it's not dealing upon us calling him but yet we pray like I said we're not told to fast and pray to try to bring God to us we're told to fast and pray to get us out of the way I thought that was fasting was not to get God to come but was to get us out of the way all right now so then all of them back in the Old Testament even coming into work that Jesus walking upon the earth would show the example that he would want for the New Testament because the New Testament never begun through the book of Acts which is when the Holy Ghost came he set forth in his ministry in his life showing that he was handpicking I remember on the daniel 70 weeks years ago said before that struck me as a really a great thought of the fact that you know what we talk about Jews coming as a nation he never started that out on he never started out like the Jews he never started out he went to the Jews and they rejected him what did he do he started handpicking he started a Gentile dispensation right there before he ever come into being sure he was still dealing with Israel you know what I love about brother Branham he would tell us things that would be marvelous things sometimes hard to understand Iran said and God never quit dealing with Israel even in Calvary you won't just go he said he dealt with him for 40 years that's a great statement that's a great guy he was still dealing with Israel 40 years what a god we serve but think about it now no man cometh unto the father but by me and no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draws him so we're in the right order the Old Testament is based upon God handpicking people maybe that's the wrong terminology you give me something else to call because he chose people right he chose Israel but then he tells you to each other he chose Israel and not Israel's natural lineage because it goes from what it Abraham to Isaac don't go to issue they don't go to all the other sons of Abraham it goes to Isaac because he's handpicking his people working on predestination why did he choose Abraham I love nothing else for one statement wrote around made to show you predestination how it works he said God knew Abraham would teach his children the we think predestination and just based upon the flip flop thing to throw out and God grabs or whatever you better remember that your profit keeps expressing the Bible where it said Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated why did he love Jacob because Jacob went for the birthright and he knew that Esau hated the birthright and that cut him off so predestination we might order consider it it might have a little bit to do with the manner of life we live but you better remember one thing now you can't get good enough to be saved so it ain't that away then he got none do being good enough to be saved it's got something to do with your yielding to God or believe in God or serving him are wanting to serve him baby might find a little predestination they in there but look what he goes on to call it now look at vert look at number 4 which is 2nd Peter 1:10 therefore they're rather a brethren div be of diligence to make your calling and election sure calling an election there's a calling that many are called but few are chosen which is few are elected Judas was caught by little great prophet great time but who was chosen many are called but few are chosen so make your calling and make your election sure well how can I do that brother brother Dale it's just pray to God didn't think about him and listen study the word thank own God it goes on down into Matthew 22 and 14 says many are called and few are chosen many are called and fewer children the choosing the prophet said I'm looking at it today he said to choosing when I think I've got it in here he said was based upon before the foundation of the world calling was by his foreknowledge from the foundation of the world he knew he would call Judas right he knew he would call him but he predestinated according to Judas and what he finished up with he called Jacob the predestinated he saw according to what Esau wanted maybe order consider it trying to bring salvation to a point of getting us to think about it think about the children of Israel as they were gathered during going down to the promised land they reached the promised land and only two were true or real believers Summerlin church age church age book page 148 that is correct because the word tells us that the rest died because of unbelief and because of unbelief they could not enter into here in Hebrews 3:19 then since that is so and only to entered then the rest were not true believers now think about true believers that were Israelites they believed they were the people of God they had two circumcision they had all the signs that all the great times they believed that they were the people of God well what about only two mazes you know to go in the promised land we know the story that is what is one thing two stayed with the word when the hearts of the ten spies failed in Katie's Barnea Joshua and Caleb did not stagger for they believed the word and said we're more than able to take the land they knew they could because God had said I have given you the land after all those Israelites saw of the power of God and goodness and deliverance of God they did not enter into rest which is the top of the Holy Ghost so you see right now that very few will ever believe all the way to receiving the Spirit of God are you gonna call them unbelievers we talk of a foolish version just give an example we talk of a foolish virgin great signs and wonders etc in all things among the foolish virgin we get to don't have the baptism in the Holy Spirit are you gonna call them unbeliever what are you gonna call them for later purposes we'll call them some that couldn't believe all the way for later purposes those that couldn't believe all the way or this wouldn't go all the way what about it well brother how do I know whether I'm called or not well that's why I ask you a simple question don't you remember somewhere in your life you better turn somewhere right I mean you made a turn somewhere to follow the Lord why don't you say count that as a day you started you remember the story of brother Branham told about the man that picked up the track and read it and says where he will you spend eternity he goes all over the nations he gets all of the great men to pray for him he goes through prayer lines he does everything they finally told him said you need to go down to William Branham and let him test you out hurts the guy went down the road around them and brother around him just talk to him and he said you remember when you picked up that track yeah he said it was solid right tire he said you mean to tell me I've had it all the time and didn't know it he said yeah violation could be a little bit different what we think we want the house something to do with it we just gotta have a little bit I didn't drink I didn't smoke I didn't run out with women and get her maybe that's why the Lord saved me well he's turned down a whole lot people it was a lot better off than that right but now are you thinking how do you know whether you're called or not that's the point we'll take just a few minutes because the whole point is called and chosen meteor call fewer chosen running that's the whole point so we've got to make our calling and election sure then we've got to have some way to find out well brother Li I know what I done I shove it now quote the Prophet once said this morning he said every denominations got their own in there one of those in there that called Methodist depended on shouting and he said a lot of shouted and didn't get to hold a gun do anything you named our C that's where we try to go to some form of something that we can think about us having something to do with it instead of thinking about God calling us instead of thinking about God working how they don't plan and purpose through you and me then he would choose us why did you marry the person you married we fell in love I've always told you the first marriage is generally nothing for love it's rather thought money or something else I don't agree with double marriages I'm just making a point why did you choose this message right now time do it God my wife or my husband made me do this out of the other my mama my daddy all right but don't you ever think about in your life or you met God and something you can think in your life that you you just I can remember that thing I can remember that situation that God was there and I saw it what made you that had the opportunities to be able to go to the tabernacle or wherever you went to hear the Prophet what made you do that now brother moe I liked him because one time I don't mean this wrong I mean brother mote was an honest man he'd tell you like it is the most everybody would say oh I wasn't letter the Lord to go I was letter to the Lord to do like you know brother mode he said I went to see the gift operate xxxii he said and then the looking into gift operates and we got caught by the word he's bringing now come on be honest that's right you went because of a gift you went because of these different things and then the word began to take hold and you begin to move on me how about it can you remember where you came from the I'm always told you know this I'm just playing and that's the way I go and I don't have to worry about anything else I like to brother branham we listen another night and he said a couple of times he said when you tell anything he said tell it to sign well again and you weren't worried about I said if you don't said you get the line about it yeah brother mote we started riding to work and he started talking about a great God he didn't talk about a prophet now he was good enough he didn't there's great God what do y'all believe huh I'm a Baptist there's word that the things come in you know that he would ask questions and in those questions a lot of times they were naturally trick questions to get us to answer but I told him one day I said Ramon I said you realize what's talking to me right now if I'd done it you'd be in bad shape he said what I said well for the down the road for the longest they'd been something tried to get me to run into a tree on your side the car are you stupid no I'm straight I tell it like it is rah cuz that something was telling me to do that but see just remember something in your life it'll help you for later in the messages we go along something in your life that you can direct everything toward and see we see most people wanted no one to do a lot of time maybe they don't know and a reason they don't but you see I always count myself to been someone who has a decent intelligence I didn't say smart I said decent intelligence and and I came to Baptist Church and I knew a lot of the doctrines of the Baptist Church I didn't have to learn it from brother Branham no he never taught me the doctrines of the Baptist Church I knew in the Baptist Church if he was baptized in that church if you joined that church he's gonna be baptized in that church no I mean it didn't no matter you go up join the church and do it you know but if you come from a Methodist Church over to the Baptist you gonna be baptized in that church you know you can go from the Baptist to the master this anywhere you want to go and it won't make you do it but the Baptist I don't know whether they still do that or not but I'm talking about fifty years ago a lot of things probably changed since then but that was the rule I was a deacon sitting there with it and knowing that those doctrines and things were there in that church the day I got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I come up out of the water I said that song that you see I knew I knew the Scriptures was right I knew what he's saying was right there's no problems about the name of the Lord Jesus Christ my problem was knowing the day I did I was out of that church it was never to be that I could go back to that church without being re baptized the lot of you don't know you doctrines or where you came from but that was the Baptist doctrine so it was not dealing with me of whether or not the word was correct it was dealing with me to know and understand can I move on from here and today I left at the time I left I was teaching Sunday School classes and I was teaching a decent the deacons and elders of the church and them and their wives I had I think was five different positions I had to resign from I went home that evening had a no barbecue pit out in the backyard it we'd used it I made it that far I fell oh my knees and that's a god I know one thing for sure whether I'm going or what I'm going cause my mother came out with it you know and my brother the mother said where you going I said I don't know my brother said what are you going he said if you want to church will build you one he said we got enough in the family we could build a church I said but that ain't it it ain't whether I'm called a priest or not I've got to move on with the truth then I said that day and that I said I've cut off all ties I'm finished I can't go back unless I repent and get baptized father son hold of God you see I knew it was over with because he done solved the problem many of you have had experiences in your life of thinking about things that you can think about now how the Lord directed you or something happened or how did you end up in this message I mean wouldn't it something that brother MO and I could start riding to work again that was the way I wound up here in the message what about it you don't remember nothing you don't remember God dealing with you talking to you telling you you need to repent murder Brennan said you can have a call to simply in a minute I'll get to it he said you can say well I've got a call brother branham he said that can be true but he said nicely what was the words he used that was the greatest gimmick that Satan could use he actually says it and then he does what he said what I said I want to go about flip-flopping in this he said look then I'll find it in a minute but he said it like this he said the devil will tell you that you're not called he said when you are called now this is a flip-flop this hey he said in the devil will tell you he'll tell you your call when you're not called you tell you're not called when you are called and it is flip flop backwards before everything you try to figure out what the devil he's gonna have it over on you he's already been there and done that and like I've always tried to tell you we come up through the Baptist and I've seen it and watched it i watch so many young men especially walk the older line and a claim to be ministers called of God and I knew there was something wrong six months three months might make it a year and they'd be gone I said the Lord that's something I didn't understand that till I came in the message to get an understanding of that situation because you realize in the Baptist you've got everything when you believe that was the doctrine you got everything when you believe all right sure if God didn't with you what's he calling you to do what's the next step you didn't got all the salvation you need the next step was whether he was called to preach or not so he had a lot of young preachers that's what I'm saying the Prophet said we had nine hundred and something different denomination and that many of them telling you how to be born again or what to do in God or how to be led of God but you don't remember something in your life that you can relate back to something that's where you got started at the Prophet said very few will believe all the way under receiving the Spirit of God now here's the bigger catch what he'll tell you you're saved when you're not then if that don't get you here to you that you're lost you get you one way or the other you need to tell you you're saved or you'll take you long and he's a good guy at it he's real good you know don't don't ever think you are a match for how do you know whether you're called or not let's take one little second this is a thought you to think about the word always comes to the truly spirit-filled that is the evidence of being filled with the Holy Spirit this is Pergamon Church age it's on number 14 if y'all want to roll over there this is what Jesus said would be the evidence he said I'll pray the father and he will send you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive how do you know whether you're called or not well number one take the thoughts that I've been for 15 minutes why are you here today why did you leave your denominational Church what did you leave your the churches and come in this message and I don't enter that out around the world or whatever what why don't you think about it is God calling you he called you to come to this message what more evidence what you want well I wrote a deal if I solvation and I spoke in tongues I shouted I cried that would have something to do with you that would not be the fact of being God choosing you and one of these days you'll realize one time that God chose you for a reason he had a reason to choose you and me if nothing else to be a good devil may I quote brother Branham if that's what he wants me to do I want to be a good one this is work but what about it what is the evidence of the holy spirit he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the Word of God for your age evidence has to do with receiving that word come on off the message broken cistern he said he was talking to somebody and said they said well what do you think is the evidence as it is into that he said I come up with the fact that it was love you remember that you'd only read it he said what God straightened me out in a vision what about God come into a prophet to straighten him out in a vision now may I say it without you getting the wrong idea what about God having to straighten the prophet out about what he thought the evidence was he was doing good would it be enough that was good with that wooden concrete do you thing what you want to until that time until the Lord showed it to him in a vision to straighten him out he wasn't right about the Holy Ghost evidence he had it right in the basis of knowing what it was and doing things yeah but he didn't have it right all the way it was a Holy Ghost straighten him out so the Holy Ghost said that the evidence of the spirit was those who would receive the word he said neither love not speaking in tongues but the receiving of the word how do you know whether you're called or not how about do you walk into work why are you not out there with everything else and may I say it would love and respect and all the God that I could think in my heart to cry what about all of these things in the message all the doctrines and ideas and perversions of the people of this message but yet you are able to walk right down the line of saying I don't believe that ice can go that away that's what I told the man with the to soul doctrine I talked to him he said come on up and preach for me I said well I can't do that anyway I work for a living and he said you know some things and I said listen brother I'm not saying you're wrong I said I'm just saying one time I can't see what you're saying to be the truth if you don't call that calling him wrong to lie or whatever you do is you do what you want to I was answering him as honest as I could from a sincere heart I said I just can't see it unless said Lord didn't tell me that so I can't believe it I've always been that way with everybody to try to be open and listen to doctrines and ideas of man kindness in this message but it's getting so now until it's it ain't even sensible to listen I'm as honest and who stated I ain't never said nothing about you listening nobody but I wonder how in the world you could listen to some of this it's on the junk of the message and come out of it was common sense and don't tell me you ain't affected with it don't tell me that I'm too old don't you tell me they can't do it I'm on quote brother branham he said the bride of Jesus Christ had no right going to Nasia that was that dire under the faith of the fathers and they went to Nicaea and he said they've brought away those times all it took was a little inroad and they brought it it's your business who you listen to and what you do but just remember it's also your business and responsibility of whether it's the truth or not and for your families why would you want your families to listen to the wrong time no problem I'm playing this could be if this ain't where you ought to be you let me know I'll try my best to give you some money to go somewhere the house I think tried to run nobody off when she's telling the truth I'm just telling it like it is cuz this is where I stand and what I stand on you can never approach the new parts with man's ideas your prophet said you believe unto eternal life he never throws nobody out he never put no church out into nothing he put the word down and let him think it over he said I can conclusively prove that you are born again by the new birth and baptized into the body of Jesus Christ then he firmly states there is no such thing as two comings of the Spirit let you think there's no such thing as to coming to the spirit he said they tried to prove that is to be an in the Bible which said it's not in the Bible said none of the Apostles ever told anything like that he said I understand a new birth I just made some statements do you understand but then I'm called a sarcastic arrogant hateful dirty old dude I'll take mine I probably fit in there somewhere I wouldn't know exactly where myself I just try to serve God and tried my best to preach this message to the people that would come and sit and listen but you got to make up your mind where you are in the word because they ain't no such thing yes us calling ourselves it's God calling us let's father what he calls us musicians come on there's a lot of things brother branham say it that you will say well he was right here wronged our great brother in this message questioning one time about Daniel 70 weeks he said I'll take what brother Branham says in the sealed book over what he said in Daniel 70 would you answer that to what what the man was to say he was saying he is wrong the 70 weeks right that see a book is that the way we think well yeah we were ready for the rapture the faith of the fathers never had that junk in it come on faith of the father's never had no problem with the Godhead and the thing they had it right now I've always told you and I don't mind saying this whatsoever because I've taught it for 40 years ever person in the world could have the new birth every person in the world could have the faith of the fathers standing where Paul was and there's no rapture be a wonderful world and live in with no rapture you tell me where I'm wrong why didn't it come back there the headstone was rejected we see we don't want those things we want something to make us feel good make us think about how good we are I'm trying to tell you how good you are you realize you're sitting here today because of some reason within your heart for some reason you come into this church for some reason you're in this message for some reason you're trying to serve God how much more could I brag about it and to try to tell you how wonderful it is well we got you might have a need y'all door open [Music] and I begin to drive [Music] really and explain [Music] it must be can you feel it can you feel him calling you [Music] you don't feel that pool in your lap [Music] you know how that humbleness that down [Music]
