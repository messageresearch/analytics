next series as we go okay amen good to see brother uh Daniel and his wife and glad to have them with us and if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading from Psalms 118 and then we will go to Zachariah 4 I know you've prayed for him but remember brother Tom he's having swelling in his uh lags and things and luckily it was not as much around his heart so we're glad of that according to brother colleag giv the test the point there and we we pray that the Lord would would be with him he called last night to let me know he's in the hospital and we'll call him out while I see how he's doing but now uh I've been reading this one scripture now this is the 12th service on Psalms 118 but I hope it is beginning to pick up why we're reading this one scripture and what we're using it for because all that we've been needing in the series is in this so it winds up in the 26th verse they talking about you know blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord so we've been through the the series of the coming of the Lord and how that uh you know it's a blessed thing to be able to see the second coming of Jesus Christ amen all right and I believe we are in that second coming and the prophet called it the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church he said the second coming we'll give these back over again at a while he said it would be the Rapture that's 308 of the seal book so then what are we looking for he said he he he doesn't come to Earth in the second coming in a physical body he doesn't come to Earth to the Jews in the tribulation in the physical body right we meet to physical body of the Lord Jesus Christ in the air in the Rapture all right so will they meet him in the air in their Rapture because they must be carried up to 144,000 and all because they will be in the millennial Reign and then that's when he comes to Earth in a Corporal body so I don't uh I I hope that's beginning to dwn upon you at least what I believe okay I always tell you what I believe about it then I can't reveal it but I can just tell you what I believe and then I can keep talking maybe long enough for the Lord to be able to reveal it okay Psalms 118 verse 19 and then we will go to Zechariah 4 father we thank you for this day and the hour that we have the time that we have upon this Earth that we be able to recognize the day that we're living and Lord it's never been an age before where man could truly see the hour they were living as being written right out in the the to the word because we see the earthquakes in diverse places we see the pestilence we see the things that the Bible speaks of the the oil throughout the ocean to kill the animals the things that are happening and we realize that we're in the end time and thank you for revealing yourself unto us and Lord we ask you now that you would just bless be with Wai in them as they're traveling back today after the service there and Lord just have your way and then be here with us as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts forgive our sins and guide us in jesus' name we ask it amen amen we'll go to verse 19 Psalms 1118 open to me the gates of righteousness now the gates of righteousness would could only be one thing what the revealed word right I mean what else would you expect to find in the gates of righteousness amen see all right open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter I will praise thee for thou Hast heard me and art become my salvation the stone now there's where we're coming finally getting to it today speak a little oner the stone which the builders refused is become the headp stone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it save now I beseech thee Oh Lord oh Lord I beseech thee send now Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord now let's go over to Zachariah a very familiar scripture with all of us Zechariah 4 we will read the first 10 verses and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and sath unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps there own and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord now he knows he's there he knows he's seeing a vision he knows that this is not just showing him a lamp stand you know right he knows as a some simp symbols here that must be understood it's not just seeing a lampstand and a and a olive trees you know all right so he was saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might not by nor by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mount before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came into me saying the hands of zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you for who ha despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel with these seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word we'll need about four up here to pass these quotes out I always like to give you what the prophet said because at least that way you can look at it and understand you know that it's something he said not just me saying it see a lot of people go around and they'll say brother R said so and so well well maybe he did and maybe he didn't because if you can't prove where he said it then you ought not be saying that way to start with but the thing of it is you know if you can show what he said at least you know that to be true now I don't want to back up too awfully much but a little bit to make sure you understand we spoke this last uh Wednesday on the message of calling Jesus on the scene in our lives you might not have thought that would been connected to the coming of the Lord but remember of what that you I've taught you what I believe I believe the second coming of Jesus Christ is the what the prophet said is I said a moment ago the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church all and it is the uh part of being the thing that was never to be understood that dire because even Jesus at the time he was on Earth he he the prophet said didn't know his part in the Kingdom all right now I didn't give you that quote but I'll be sure to fly these if you want them but he said when he come to patmas said then he understood so then that's why it starts off saying the Revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John uh and all because it was something that he didn't understand he didn't know when he was coming so we know then the second coming of Jesus Christ would be a mystery all right now you've got many Mysteries uh in the Bible you know the mystery of the engrafting of the Gentiles and Mysteries of all kind of things the godhead to be understood all of the Mysteries you've go to uh um Church what time is it and you'll find brother randam explaining the Mysteries all right but now my point was to get you to see that if the coming of the Lord is is started on the day of Pentecost in the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know the new birth we see then it would be a process that would be taking place and not something to just say like we thought it would be the sky split the trumpet sounds of this the that the other would happen and oh we'd know the Lord's come you know and everybody in the world going to know he's com well then he said it was a secret and then you know well then uh just letay them on that front seat there brother K if anybody needs them they'll have them thank you sir but see I that's why I tell you what I believe that way you don't have to go around and say well what does brother Dale believe at least you know what I believe amen cuz I tell you what I believe all right then you come tell me what's right or wrong see okay but now see calling Jesus on the scene as our lives would be the resurrecting or bringing God back back from history and coming up through what would be talking about the stature of a perfect man right I didn't have time to finish the message I just could hit it just a little bit and the where that we could see him actually coming on the scene in our own lives and by that we would recognize our day right see and people would say but brother Dale the coming of the Lord is is something out there well where right where would it be when your Prophet said that it was the Rapture page 308 of the sick book and he said Jesus don't set foot on Earth until the Millennium in other words we meet him in the a so now what are you looking in the coming see in the first coming of Jesus Christ I brought it out there Wednesday see the prophets brought the body and John being the the one to introduce the head and see the head which was Christ chist came forth upon the Earth You Know The Headstone that was there they rejected him as The Headstone and he became the Cornerstone of the New Testament Kingdom not The Headstone because the prophet said The Headstone hadn't come yet we see because it had to leave him in the Garden of Gethsemane because nobody couldn't understand what it was about you know and see if they had received it that would have been his second coming right there he said that's just too simple well I thought we read somewhere um here in maybe in verse 10 who has despised the day of small things and your Prophet said the day of Simplicity all right see then if we can't make it simple enough until the children can understand it then we've totally missed the whole point anyway you know of trying to preach but now listen recognizing your day and its m message and then accepting that that message not only is for us in this day but it's in US amen we are to make this message manifest right it's just not a book given or tapes given or or sermons given see it it's a life because then that way you can see that while you're Prophet would say like this and this is kind of a secondary title of your message brother Brandon said the seven seal is his coming that's on Feast of the trumpets it's his coming well we're looking for well then he must be coming or has it we missed it to see that he's been coming all the way down down right this is our part of his coming right see all right now watch in a minute when we get to that we go ahead now Jesus Christ would you agree that Jesus Christ and I'm talking about the man now and the whole kitten Kaboodle of all he is right that he was a predestinated seed right would you agree that even before the foundation of the world he stood as a lamb slain right in other words scriptures was specifically speaking of him even my brother Samantha this preacher he said uh a lot of the things in the Bible is Hocus Pocus I said well what do you think about Jesus he said oh yeah that's right said that's that part is right you know because they at least teach them enough in the cemeteries because he had 12 years in it and uh they at least teach him enough about the word to be able to follow things you know and so he'd agree that Jesus was a predestinated seed all right now but brother Bram I gave them to you I just you scan down reading them it's on that's rising of the sun number one on your notes that every age has got a predestinated seed now all right page 10 it's riseing the sun number one okay let me make sure that I'm on the right pages with you yep page 10 is riseing the sun okay now a predestinated seed forever age now do you believe that God knew before the world that there was going to be a false falling away down to the ages right cuz he spoke of it and he said there would have to be a falling away but then you spoke of a restoration well wouldn't you truly believe then that Martin Luther in the days of justification that that was a predestinated seed right now I gave it to you you know cuz I like to lay it in I right number two on your notes 154 the church age book that it's not the person that comes PR destinated eternally from God it is the word our seed right see the person comes predestinated basically by forn knowledge form but wouldn't you agree though that if something is predetermined cuz that's what predestination means now don't you believe that there was a a predetermined word other just shall live by faith now come on see then you'll separate if you keep it in the right order that there then God by for knowledge knew Martin Luther would receive that their brains in your whole scale of predestination but the seed itself was predestinated eternally just like the Lord Jesus was predestinated eternally am so wouldn't you believe that an end time people end time bride people that is to bring this thing to a total end amen amen would you not believe that we are predestinated to be a predestinated seed of the age now I don't go along with what everybody preaches on that no no no I don't because see they bypass Calvary they bypass everything oh I just de seed I just predestinated you know no I I I believe we got to live a predestination right all right see Martin Luther had to preach that just should live by faith he didn't didn't just walk out one day and preach he preached all his life he had to do that and we believe that because that's what you're talking about on a predestinated sea see Jesus you can look at him but what about you and I what about Malachi 4 would you not agree that Malachi 4 is an end time scripture right you know not for any other age down through there but for this age so then it's a predestinated seed we are to re the full word of God right now so you're what now it's not the person who comes predestinated eternally but the word are seed but now when God finishes his plan of predestination that's what I believe we miss that you mean to tell me he doesn't know where that seed's going to fall now he said he did but are you saying well now you know brother Dale you're getting too far into predestination well maybe we're not getting far enough to understand predestination we know that we sure would have to come into the world as lost the prophet would say that seed laying down in there but what was it waiting on what was it waiting on it was waiting on someone for it to land in right so then we bring it predestination into the right point I don't want to get on that I want to get on into the message see Jesus was all the word you agree right now your Prophet said the bride in the end time will be the fullness of the godhead bodily now that's up to you to decide what you want to think about it well I don't know others don't believe that well then you don't believe him so go ahead and forget it but that's only uh mighty God unveiled I know for certain in unveiling of God that the bride is to be the fullness of the godhead bodily why because that's the point we've been talking about what is the point we've been talking about on the second coming of Jesus Christ that God would be visible Among Us and raise the dead and we go into Rapture but visible doesn't mean Corporal that's right physical amen visible means that you can see it with a spiritual eye right because everybody will never see all of the coming of the Lord right that's right cuz how can it be a mystery how can it be a secret if that would be true H but now watch see he was all the work would you agree that the very presence of almighty God walked upon this Earth even a trinitarian order to believe this let alone being believing in one true and living God a trinitarian would have to admit that the Bible says Jesus was the fullness of the godhead bodily right so that shouldn't be no problem to me and you that claim to believe in one God right but do you believe that that was the very presence of almighty God but how many saw it see how he can be actually visible among you and you'll never see him how many actually saw that that was almighty God the very essence or presence of almighty God dwelling on earth right that was his first coming amen right his first coming was an actual presence all right now in his second coming which would be the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church it would not be a physical body because if he's heing a physical body it'd be messing up scripture goz where is body that's right and the prophet of God said these people say they got oil and all this and and blood and all like that he said they're messing it up cuz they're saying that the Corporal bodies here and he said that doesn't work because we meet him in the a right we'll see somebody come along with a great delivery that can just bring them down and just slay it down and say you I can't help it if my brain said hey wait a minute that wasn't what the prophet said right the somebody you know I remember one time we was in a min meeting with some brothers years ago and I said something about the the 144,000 getting killed and the two prophets getting killed and I mean that brother said that ain't right I mean right up they just jumping you know that ain't right what do you mean that ain't right well brothers so and so said it oh my I love brother so and so right the Bible but if you'll give me about 2 seconds we'll read the scripture where they're killed right and then you give me a couple of more seconds for somebody to bring me my seal book up here and we'll show you in the seal book where the 144,000 the two witnesses killed so I don't give a h what so and so said right well of course you know I wouldn't too popular probably wouldn't be well so and so that don't matter I'm just trying my best to to preach the gospel and be what I am but now remember the title of the message which talking the coming of the Lord but here's your title headstone his presence headstone his presence now watch that in a minute secondary title he is coming the seventh seal glad to have our sister back there with us we always say when you come one time to the church you're welcomed as a visitor but you come two times you're part of love us cuz we don't have anything to join so welcome to you the prophet of God said in the token message 1963 that it was the bride coming of Christ top of the Bride coming out of the church like Israel of old number three on your notes if she doesn't if the sister doesn't have a set of them somebody come up and get her a set because we believe in what the prophet of God said so we read it okay then we've read this one over and over it's the rising of the sun number four on your notes where the prophet of God says in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church that there'll be a sheath having to be waved number five is off of the Rapture is talking about the very word Christ means called Church means called out he said a church out of a church members from every denomination ation making up a bride bride tree it's it's in the T tape the bride tree a bride coming out called okay now then the the Lord has been coming all the way down to there am right cuz uni age people were coming out of the church now the word Church in the Bible is called called out all right so now but when you're referring to bride you're referring to a church of a group called out of a church because it's just in the Bible it just uses the word church to apply for all religious forms right right but then when it's speaking of the bright the chosen ones they are the alive word for the age that they were living yes right which that is sister Kathy we were talking about a while ago that is the message of the hour of each hour that was down through there that message was the alive word The Living Word Martin Luther was a Living Word not a dead letter he had the letter but Paul said the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life all right as I said then the prophet in Masterpiece covers the part of the body being built by the prophets and then the life being The Headstone coming to that that's number six on you notes so in the end time would not end up being that John introduced Jesus back there the Messiah well then it it is it not to be in the end time that the headstone is to be introduced and was not that what we were reading in Zachariah now number seven the prophet said Christ revealed his own word building the church coming out into the headstone I'm going to make this statement I think three times that I have it underline to do I believe that the coming of The Headstone to the bride of Christ is the closest you'll ever come here in this earth the Gentile days through the literal coming of Jesus Christ right because we meet him in the air all right but he's going to be visible Among Us now that headstone was rejected back there left Jesus in the garden the anointing the prophets said left him but his promised to come back in the end time on phone who you and me well that was just in brother brandham no amen for that it was in brother brandham but he was not all the fullness of the godhead bodly but the bride can be right all right but see for him to be visible Among Us right on your notes what the Holy Ghost is given for take us in the Rapture goes on down to the next one forgotten Beatitudes where he covers and he said he's not been seen for years and years and years but now coming visible Among Us proof of the Resurrection in 1955 he said visible among the early risers the alpha and the Omega remember we're talking about the other day that when Jesus rose from the dead he appeared there in the scriptures to some of the disciples to Mary right but then you don't see him anymore until the evening time but in the evening time it appears among the disciples or walks through the wall now you remember back when we were covering this message because this is more or less a review message Lord spoke to me about something that I've been praying over 40 years about so I don't worry about where I'm at because he give me the right answer you say pray in 40 years yeah yeah see most everybody thinks you can read The Prophet's message you got a revelation no you got head knowledge that's why the scripture says that that you can know all Mysteries and have not charity you miss it amen love because this is the end time that you can know all the Mysteries or Roberts University has all of brother Brandon's Tes and books they can sit down and read and know all about all of the Mysteries but they can't get the Revelation I'm sorry cuz that's where I believe the second coming of Jesus Christ is the new birth to you amen that starts it it will end when we meet him in the air amen you know all right now see because only the bride he can appear you remember I gave you the appearing my brother Brown said he was he's now appearing before his coming gave you all the quotes down through their jokes putting them on the computer they can read them but here's one thing I wanted you to get just like I did Wednesday night you remember Wednesday night if you look down at number 15 on your notes you'll find it you know there in the scriptures in Mark 4 where we were talking about it Wednesday that those disciples feared the winds and the waves didn't they right they were scared they thought they were going to die they go wake him he steals the winds and the waves and the Bible says verse 41 I think is when it's in fourth chapter of Mark said they were exceedingly afraid that's right another words they were more afraid of the power the man had that was inside the boat than they were of the waves and the things that could have killed him the of God I just gave you one there where he says people say brother brandham you shouldn't be talking about the second coming of Jesus Christ you scare the people he said why should you be afraid of his second coming see the reason the disciples were afraid they didn't have the new birth right cuz there was no way to have the new birth till Jesus Christ died and was given a new birth all right so they didn't have it so they're scared to death he said are we afraid of his coming brother Tatum used to talk about it and they said it was in a lot of brother arounds but he said Jack cold would stand up there and just call out people you're living in adultery you're doing this you're doing that right down the line calling out one out or another and said after while the line was just empty cuz everybody's afraid to come up there right scared that your sins were going to be called out why would be if we be afraid of the second coming of the god that we claim to be living in our hearts and to be our savior Our Redeemer our all in all right why would we be afraid of it you mean if you were gone for three months and separated from your wife or your husband and you wouldn't want to be getting home to see him of course not everybody would right brother used to go to church here with us he'd stay up here he'd say I don't want to go home he said CU me and my wife we get to fussing but you mean you don't love your wife enough that you want want to see her every day you need to fall in love again and why wouldn't you love God enough that you want to see him brother R said I want to see the one that died for me don't you I'm looking forward to the second coming of Jesus Christ see he appears in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to anoint to heal signs and wonders takes place he can appear in the denominations he can appear anywhere to today you mean if people got healed while the Beatles were singing that that wasn't God something wrong with your mentality now the Beatles wasn't God but if somebody got healed it was God are we afraid of his coming no wonder your Prophet would come down to it and say he's here listen he can appear in a denominations appear anywhere but his coming is revealed in the bride see now watch is not the coming that we've been speaking of the coming of Christ into an individual not as a group he doesn't come as a group to a group he comes to individuals Amen in the baptism of the Holy Ghost right the the Pud this is a gentile dispensation right okay number two all right see what I said a few moments ago of how the coming of The Headstone to the bride is the closest to the physical coming of Christ we see before we meet him in the air in the Rapture and you see what I believe believe it is the second coming of Jesus Christ wasn't just because you got born again that was him coming in you there's something for him to do right something for us to do all right so can come in as a Rapture 308 let's just take something now for a minute because this is what I want you to think about if you're not there turn back in the book of Zechariah let's go back here and let's just look at the book book of Zechariah we won't get through all of it today I know but even this afternoon we won't but I want to drive a point down for you to see as I said Zachariah shown some things but he doesn't understand have we read the Bible the prophet's message and admittingly and will admit that we don't see what's being said you agree you read it you read it you read it you don't understand it right cuz you know there's something there that you're not getting right amen now you're reading the letter now does the book change the next day you know do they put out a new book the second day that you read it no it's just same book it's the same Bible the same Bible that mankind used to prove there was a trinity is the same Bible the prophet used to prove there's only one God right so it was there but it was hidden see a mystery is something hidden in the word even it said the mystery of the inra of the Gentiles was never understood by the Jews do you think they understood that no way you think they wanted to talk about RAB the Harlot you think they wanted to talk about those things like that no they didn't care nothing about those things it was part of their history that they couldn't deny but they didn't want to talk about it because it was a mar against them because that was a dog coming in a gentile but back there in the Old Testament spoke of it you think they liked as brother randam said do you think a real true Jew would like to tell about how that David had his best friend's W uh best friend killed to get to take his wife you think they wanted to write that no but God made them write it they had no choice that's right they didn't want to admit it they would probably have some form of a great beautiful story to tell of why this don't work but it's still in the word today people can explain this and explain that but it's still in the word you know but look now this is very something similar simple to all of us we already be able to understand but look at him he now Angel talked with him and he awakened him and he showed him verse two what seest thou in other words he said unto him and I said I've looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof now he shows him a picture of something maybe he showed him a lampstand maybe he showed him you you know like seven golden candlesticks your Prophet explained those things right and then he saw verse three and I he said and two olive trees by it two olive trees would be two trees growing up you know that's what he saw one on the right side the bowl and the other on the left side there Ro so I answered and spake to the angel that talk with me saying what are these my Lord what are you trying to show me okay what do you think he was trying to show him what do you think he was trying to show him we know the story right but do we have the Revelation that's right we know the story correct right seven golden candlesticks it's not a a a like a a candle burning you know but it was a lampstand like you know my and seven of them and going up and and then the two olive trees was not two olive trees growing out in the bushes you know because the oil was running out of the olive trees down into the bowls and keeping the candles burning now to show you something that really amazed me and it really clicks and I asked a man about it the other day and he said oh man I got to think on that when we were in Israel there's four of us here today that will witness that you know you talk about seven golden candlesticks the manora if I pronounce that correctly and brother George Smith he hollered he said hey Sam he said how many candlesticks are the of the thing you know I said brother George there's seven golden candlesticks why would you ask that he said would you mind looking over at the House and Senate of Israel the dean sister piggy would hear my wife back there and we were riding down through there he said would you mind looking over at the house and Sen it you know big vat building I said yeah he said what's that on the top of it I said that's the manora he said would you count the candlesticks I said 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 I said brother George you got to explain something to me I even asked Ruben the guy and he was wonderful to try to express it see most people don't know that the manora has nines candlesticks how but R around said seven I'll take seven well okay do what you want to you're not going to change what I'm saying I asked Reuben I said Ruben what does that mean and the Jews believe in seven-day creation we believe in six day creation and you know God Rest in the SBB the Jews they'll say it this way they say seven days creation they don't say s days of creation they say seven days creation I keep asking him you know and he'd say it again 7day creation and he said you know he said seven of those is seven day creation and he said we believe that one of those other two represents the god that you're worshiping I said well Ruben would you believe maybe the other one would represent the person that done the worshiping he he said I don't know never thought of it that gives me a thought but you say but now brother Dale I've seen they're flag so am I all over the place it's got seven golden candle sck CU you see God made that Nation testify and not put the nine up there made them testify in their flag of the seven golden candlesticks because John goes to patmas and sees the same thing it we'll get to in a minute right and here is Zachariah and what's he covered seven lamps seven golden candlesticks not seven candles burning they burn out but seven lamp stands you keep pouring the oil in it it keeps burning all right now still though what did you what are these my Lord and I wonder if some of you catching on some of the words I use I'm not a theologian but I got a little sense and when he says to him watch this is an angel speaking to Zacharias and Zacharias says what are these my Lord look down at it if you got an scopal Bible that's little l r d lowercase Lord it means an angel of God was speaking to Zechariah now when you get down to verse eight in a few minutes says were ver moreover the word of the Lord look at it an uppercase one of these days it'll appear to you why I'm using that might take you 40 years that's all right it took me 40 years to know something about those Le stands I mean about those um candles the uh two witnesses we'll get to it later but look verse 5 then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord now here's his explanation well you just got to explaining it there seven golden candlesticks representing the seven Church AG now your Prophet just got to explaining that's what it is do you believe him now what is it doing what is his answer back to zable then he answered and spake unto me saying this is seven golden candlesticks represents Church ages to come down through the Cent uh that's not what it says in words that's what it says by Revelation okay look then he answered and SP to me saying this is the word of the capital l r d unto zable Zechariah I'm going to show you what I showed rub now it would take a long time for me to cover it I have before back there go back to Hagi and you'll find zeru go back to Ezra you'll find zable run a run run a text on zable sometimes and find out that there was a natural Governor back there that his name was jerub zerubabel but look he said this is the word of the Lord under jerub not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord of hostes he didn't say seven golden candlesticks represen seven Church ages right that's what he said cuz what were the seven Church ages the bride of Christ down through seven Church ages right which was the word of God for each age right you agree so now that's exactly what he's showing him right it come on read your scripture right there in front of you he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord what I showed you is the word of the Lord where's the word of the Lord through seven Church ages coming down the Bride of Jesus Christ is the word of God made manifest right come on that's why I believe that's his second coming is so I'm not finished with all this so don't worry about it I'll give you what I want to give today and then we'll give them rest later I'm not nasty I'm just want to hold till I can get a better understanding myself now watch verse 7 do you understand verse 6 he said this is what I'm trying to show you that it's the word of the Lord and the word of the Lord is shown by seven Church ages right each age was the word of God alive for that age the people of that age amen that's why it say coming see verse seven now who art thou oh great Mountain before zerus in other words who AR thou there's he's showing him something look like hey wait a minute now there's a mountain look like standing here I got a problem I can't get over it he said before zerubu Thou shalt become a plain right what's he going to do now what's his zerubu going to do and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shouting crying Grace Grace unto it I've heard a lot of people in this message preach that Jesus preached three and a half years back there and that that was a high first first half of his ministry and the last half would be judgment preached by the prophet now you show me that in the Bible I want your Prophet saying that it's the message of Grace you turn down Grace you're going to be judged the two two witnesses will take this message to Israel that's right amen there's not they don't have to preach seven years of a different three and 1/2 years of a Grace Ministry three and 1/2 years of a judgment you turn down because that's what they're going to preach to them they're going to preach this message over there to them to make the seven years that is Promised but now keep it in mind of what we're saying who art thou oh great Mountain before jeru zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain in other words he's going to what was it in John that uh how was it in in John there in the scriptures that explaining when John the Baptist came that the high places would be made low the Low Places would be made High read your Bible you know right right cuz that's what's happening here and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shouting crying Grace Grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zable have laid the foundation of this house now here's where I get in trouble but you find it you find zerubba will laying the foundation he did not the original Foundation was swept off of the original where Solomon built the temple so now you say what are you doing you correcting the scripture and the prophet no just hold on a minute then don't turn your computers off out there and say this guy's goofing Hub listen I want to read what your Prophet said about it he said he took us back to the foundation in t CU brother randam never laid the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets they laid it Jesus Christ is the Chief Cornerstone that's right was laid by the apostles that's right what zerubabel then done they cleaned off the original Foundation that Solomon had left in the temple amen and then to begin to build right right the hands of zeru will have laid the foundation of this house his hand shall fin also finish it and he and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you who ha despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel with those seven eyes they are the eyes of of the Lord which run through to run to and fro through the whole earth over in the Book of Revelations we don't have well we'll try to get in a minute but there's seven eyes seven spirits in the Book of Revelation right is the Holy Ghost in seven Church ages right do you need that quote from Brother brandham it is the Holy Ghost in seven Church ages but now listen Zer Rubble the actual meaning of his name it is Prince with God Prince with God now according to my understanding about a prince a prince is a Son of God but he's waiting to be king is that the correct understanding he's not King he's in process to be king all right see this perfectly showed in what look at number I have to pick up where I'm at 17 in your notes we done jump the way over read all these others in between I give them to you this is off the message of Grace in 17 18 19 17 18 is both off the same message 17 and 18 all the way down right look from the message of Grace preached in 1961 827 and we're all acquainted with the scripture that read that reads the Bible we know that that was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple and zal was a great Prince among the people who had laid the foundation of the building he he even says those things that's fine cuz that's what he done he cleaned it all watch him explain it n a minute and I want you to put on your spiritual thinking cap anointing jacket this morning as we think and this great Prince that had to had determined to rebuild a house of the Lord and then when he did he had laid the foundation stone and as we read on further we find out that God said zeruel has laid the foundation with his hands he also shall bring forth The Headstone I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the Cornerstone he shall bring forth The Headstone now this prophet in the end time didn't bring a Cornerstone Cornerstone was faith of the fathers we're build on the foundation Apostles Prophet Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone because that's what he goes on to explain and we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone and he's also the headstone now if we'll think for a few minutes that the seventh Church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by power not by might but by my spirit sayth the Lord not by organization not by denominations but by the holy Spirit God will bring forth the church in the last day zerubabel the prince was Joshua was the one that was to bring forth this headstone he had laid the foundation he had took the people back to the foundation in typ do you see why I was saying that a minute ago now rer lay the foundation he cleaned it off right and he didn't lay the Cornerstone Cornerstone goes on that part see because the Cornerstone is disciples see but where was it zerubabel represents the end time messenger which is not brother brandham he's not the messenger the Lord Jesus Christ is the messenger sure there's a man to be used upon Earth but my goodness get it right see he never laid the Cornerstone the disciples laid that Cornerstone but in the end time in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church the prophet is going to bring forth The Headstone crying Grace Grace unto it now because God promised it see he had to take us back to the foundation before he could even speak of The Headstone you got to go back to the faith of the fathers before hear all of this before you can speak of the the love of God to headstone you you can't just do it I know this may be strange to some but hang on he took us back in time cleaned off the foundation taking us back to the faith of the fathers showing that original Cornerstone that's the coming of The Headstone and what the coming of The Headstone is what the adoption to the Bride of Jesus Christ which the prophet of God calls to the way I look at it is the visible form of Jesus Christ see then in the end time is a special people to bring the headstone of Jesus Christ into manifestation now to prove we're right about the coming of The Headstone when they were building the Temple or restoring the temple when they built the temple and then there was in restoration of the temple 2 chonicles 5 and uh 10 and First Kings 8 and9 there was nothing in the Ark of the Covenant save the 10 stone or the table bble to Stone that the Ten Commandments that was what was in the Ark of the Covenant was the Ten Commandments you had pockets on the side Moses wrote other laws which he wrote other things which he wrote Genesis Exodus Leviticus number Deuteronomy that was not laying in the Ark of the Covenant that was in the pockets along the side there was Pockets made for those things because the Ten Commandments the prophet of God Called It the seals which is number 21 of your notes if you look down our reading 300 unveiling of God 1964 he talks about when the Commandments came right the seals came read it number 21 on your notes but you see what the secret was that even when the tables of stone went into to read your scripture we don't have time there when they was doing it and got the temple ready brother R said there wasn't nothing in there but a bunch of furniture that's his words in one of the quotes I gave to you and what does it do then came the two tables of stone the Ark of the Covenant came into the Tabernacle that was The Headstone that was the capping Stone your Prophet said called it on dedication we'll get back to it more this afternoon on the message dedication said we already have the stones the stones for ordained we got all of them way up from Ephesus to Ephesians number 19 on your note we're only waiting for the headstone that the builders rejected waiting for his coming the capping Stone the great stones are confessions we know that confession is a stone and then he goes right on over it to explain to you what it is explaining to you what those things were those two tables of stone that went into that's number 19 of your notes when the tables of stone was on the inside two tables of stone same song The then what happened read your scripture when the two tables of stone came in the Ark of the Covenant came into the to the Tabernacle then the Shak of Glory fell right and the prophet of God called the T called The Ten Commandments to seals he didn't have any trouble with doing that why cuz I can take them one after the other and preach all the rest of the afternoon on the Ten Commandments I've done it before so no problem and show you how that each one will fit right together cuz what is the first one behold oh Israel the Lord thy God is one huh marriage and divorce you know it's all right there in the Ten Commandments everything's right in the Ten Commandments cuz the Ten Commandments was the word of God but that was not the that was The Headstone to the church but it was not the shik of Glory The Headstone had to be in place before the shikan glory that's what everybody in the message look looking at The Headstone and they call it the sh kind of Glory come some great anointing going to strike when he day that headstone huh you're out of your scriptures read your Bible your Prophet told you what it said and went right back to the dedication look at him number 20 on your notse that's when it found its final resting place this you kind of Glory that followed those capping Stone not the corner the in stone the main thing all other Stones was of none effect until then but this main Stone came in The Headstone and took its place positionally for its resting place for that generation the glory of God filled a place where they were sitting and there was Shak kind of Glory upon the whole building and the glory was so great till the the priest couldn't even Minister because of the glory well brother dad what are you looking for I'm looking for just what it says over there on number 22 on your notes which I give it to you over and over questions and answers 19 and uh 54 brother ROM said after the door of the Gentile church is closed all on God anoint the church then God will do in one year what theologist tried to do in 2,000 years watch him he said but he's doing it now keep reading till you see where that's underline he said he's doing it now why cuz he's anointing us the new birth is the anointing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul of the individual he's doing it but one day after the door of the Gentile church is closed now let me say it one more time see that's why I believe that the headstone is the visibility of almighty God to come among the church adoption time when he can pour in his fullness and he can say here you him I told him many many many years ago probably about 40 something years ago 40 they were talking about boy I'll be glad when that headstone comes we can just speak the word I said you got to have it before it can do you any good CU see I knew that quote there then because I've had these quotes in my Bible a long time that those two tables of stone was The Headstone that come into the the temple then the Shak Glory follows those capping Stones The Prophet said follow that headstone The Headstone is the word amen what other headstone would you want oh I want this great anointing amen so do we all that's all right we'll get to it this afternoon where the Prophet said power apart from character is what satanic he said it was satanic all I want is the power of God it can be satanic to you too right I want the word in place I want the temple built now words I'm pointing back here the statue of perfect man to them on tell you I want this temple built in me and in you and then we'll realize what the headstone really is the revealed word amen then there your kind of Glory can fall amen like it did back there when they built the Tabernacle in the wilderness was the same then when they built the natural Temple it was there and so was it in the days of zerubabel when they brought it in there which is the book of es Ezra and the different ones through going through there read those through there and you'll find the restoration of the temple but that's what I wanted you to see we didn't get time to go over in the Book of Revelation we'll go this evening in the Book of Revelations you find the seven golden candlesticks right you find just what I've been talking about that Zachariah was speaking of well Zachariah what did you see I saw seven golden candlesticks Zachariah what is that I don't know I just seven golden Candlestick when a prophet sees things he doesn't understand un until God reveals it you agree he he may see something look crazy you know that who was it uh non non looked down through time and he saw Buick and O mobiles running up down expressways and saw them running into each other that's right what'd he write down he didn't know what a Buick nose mobile looked like he didn't know what a car looked like he didn't know how to describe it the only thing he had to describe it with was what what he said chariots jostling in the streets he knew what that was he knew those were vehicles that people were being carried in and he knew chariots were josing in in the streets with vehicles said running like lightning other words he can see them with torches standing on the side of those things or Little Old Lantern things something made torches mainly on the side of those chariots but he really seen Buick and mobiles running up and into each other on the expressway see when the prophet sees things he doesn't understand he has to wait for God to reveal it then when he reveals it then he can tell us right so your Prophet told us what it meant in Zachariah the seven golden candlesticks and what it was all about but did you catch it see the short end of scripture said but now what it he said this is the word of the Lord the word to jerub not by power not by my but by my spirit sayith the Lord who's going to build a church ages who's going to bring the statue of perfect man God is our part is only to yield ourselves unto that like I've always tried to tell you how do you get those virtues in the Statue of perfect man I waited 71 until 80 but 82 10 years or more Waiting for God to tell me what that was how could I get it all if we need patience we just start beating the Daylights out of each other tribulation work of patience that's don't bring you to the stature of perfect man I knew better than that and I waited and I prayed and one day the Lord said only through the revealing of the word can those virtues come into be I said thank you Lord as enough for me to preach about 5 years on what he showed me the other day about those two olive trees is enough to preach through the Millennium but think on these things can you see the church ages in the Bible spoke of in Zechariah now this evening we'll pick it up in the New Testament and we'll read it from the New Testament and see what it actually is talking about we'll see what zerubabel saw and what took place and why zerubu would sweep off the foundation lay the foundation sweep it off all of those things can be used but what they were really doing was rebuilding a temple right they were rebuilding the temple they finally got the temple made but that wasn't what that talking about that we're talking about God revealing himself down through seven Church ages not by power not by might by my spirit sayth the Lord let's stand come on brother think on these things what do you see Zariah I just see candlesticks do you know what that means no I don't know what it means that brother brand who was it was um let's see now if I miss this and forgive me but I think it was when um Peter saw the vision of the sheep being let down and saw the animals and the things or something like that brother said and said Peter probably thought well maybe we're going on a fishing trip or hunting trip now he showed him the engrafting of the Gentiles right when the prophet sees things he's got to explain it that's why it says that the word comes to the prophet but then after it comes to the prophet there's a five-fold ministry that's got to break that down of course today as I get to it this evening today everybody you know they just got a onefold and then all the preachers have just got a
