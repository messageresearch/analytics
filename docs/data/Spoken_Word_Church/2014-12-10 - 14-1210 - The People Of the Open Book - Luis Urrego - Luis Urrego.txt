holy holy i want to see you amen praise the lord jesus trust that is your desire tonight amen amen so we appreciate the lord and appreciate the opportunity to be in front of the sacred desk amen and to just be gathered with lovely people like you amen i believe i am gathered with the bride of jesus christ i don't know about you but i believe that right amen so if you come a man to receive and what you expect to receive and if you come to criticize you're going to get some criticism amen if you come to amen to uh you know pull for the word you're going to receive the word amen so i believe that without my heart i appreciate brother dale giving me the opportunity amen so i want to keep you standing here too much longer let me uh let's go ahead to the scriptures to john chapter eight john chapter eight i was having i was having a little trouble putting these these things on and then uh i saw for the dale you know sort of pointing over there to get this thing on and i don't know how he knew that i didn't have him on because then for the wade came back there i said brother wade i'm either gonna have to use just a handheld mic or you help me put this thing on and he helped me put it on so so i appreciate that amen um john chapter 8 verse 21 let's start at verse 21. amen it says then said jesus again unto them i go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sins whether i go ye cannot come then said the jews will he kill himself because he saith whether i go you cannot come and he said unto them ye are from beneath and i am from above ye are of this world i am not of this world right because people of this world amen they think that in that carnal way amen we have we thought in the incarnal way at a point in time amen so jesus came in and and gave us his mind amen we thought we thought carnally amen you are from beneath and i am from modab above you are of this world i am not of this world said i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins then said they unto him who art thou and jesus said unto them even the saying that i said unto you from the beginning i have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him they understood not that he spake to them of the father then said jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things amen and i believe that that's how the bride of jesus christ works as well amen they will not do anything outside of this word amen verse 29 and he that sent me is with me the father hath not have not left me alone for i do always those things that please him as he spake these words many believed on him don't you pay attention to that many believed on him but was that enough because jesus immediately tells him then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free praise god amen let's just bow our heads for the word prayer tonight heavenly father we thank you lord for this opportunity that you've given us lord to be gathered together lord in the name of the lord jesus christ we will pray now father that you would have your way lord hear in the service speak to our hearts let us receive something from you father god and let us hear lord leave here lord edified and you glorified lord and let us just have something lord to be drawn closer to you father this evening we love you and we commit this time into your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen praise the lord you may be seated tonight amen praise god amen maybe i'll give a little title to this little thought amen the people of the open book the people of the open book i believe there is a people god has a people here on this earth amen who read amen from an open book amen who receive from an open book it's not a close book now to the bride of christ amen now you might be uh you might be in different levels as and the statue of a perfect man amen but i believe that as you're growing amen that book that book is being revealed and opened up to you even more and more praise god now even faith is a revelation amen so even when you start down at the bottom that's a revelation to you that's the book opening up to you amen and how what i want to get to tonight amen is and i've just been ever since you know we've been uh coming to the church and uh i just maybe get kind of a little bit personal i really appreciate the ministry here and i really appreciate amen the uh the uh the the the the uh the time and the effort that god that is involved amen and going into the word amen i certainly i certainly needed that and uh i could say in the last three four months amen i've been growing amen a lot and i just thank the lord for that amen because um you know you you you even even in the in the ranks of the message you know you're still out there and uh you think things of a certain way amen but when when you look at when you look at things amen in the word amen you see how they are amen going to make you think amen what was i believing amen so i just appreciate amen brother dale in the ministry here and brother wade each one of the ministers here man and so i just ask that you all continue to remember brother brother dale and brother wade all these ministers amen in prayer amen that the lord will just use them amen to continue bringing them by bringing us that word amen praise god so so we um we are people of an open book tonight amen and i like what jesus said here in verse 31 if we read it again it says then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed right now i want you to notice amen that the disciples the 12 apostles at one point in time he had 70 70 disciples they were with him amen and and when he started breaking forth that word amen a lot of them when he started describing if you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part of me they couldn't understand what he was talking about and so all of a sudden the bible tells us that they started walking away why because they couldn't understand they could that they could not receive that was too hard for them to receive amen then he turns over to the disciples and he says are you going to go away also right and he said and and of course we know that the great words of peter amen when he said where shall we go you are the only one who has the words of eternal life amen and i believe amen that we serve a god who has the words of eternal life tonight and has a word specifically just for you amen and so when peter said that amen when he said that he said we know that our the christ amen and judas was standing right there amongst him right so he was including judas right there with him amen as we know that you are the christ the son of the living god and what does what does jesus immediately tell them he tells them amen have i not chosen you 12 and one of you don't just have a devil but one of you is a devil one of them then just to have the devil he said but one of you is a devil amen and him knowing who the christ was him knowing who jesus was right there that we know we know that you are the one that come from god we know we believe you amen and and judas was able to cast out devils healed the sick and do all these things just exactly like the disciples because god had jesus had given him power a man to do these things back in matthew 10. but yet even after they believe amen judas could not continue with that word right and this is this is exactly amen what jesus is telling them here then said jesus to those jews which believed on him amen if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed amen like i said before amen there's a part that you must do as well you must get into the word of god amen you must amen uh reverence the word of god amen be into this word amen uh day and night amen why because we are the people of the open book i mean we should be excited as the bride of christ amen to have amen this word revealed unto us amen for us not to be able not not to uh not to uh uh look into the scriptures and and study and and do what we need to do amen because i tell you what amen uh we we we can get we can get so lazy and so relaxed in this day and time right i've said it before amen people have come to the point amen where they just put this thing on cruise control and they said well you know the the the the one day there's gonna be a resurrection i'll just be part of it and uh and then the lord will come amen and and and you'll just you'll just be riding on cruise control somewhere or another the lord will put will will put me in into that economy some way or another amen but you have to me man you have to uh uh uh be part of this of this amen you have to put your part into it as well amen because god's not gonna give you anything that you don't want god's not going to give you anything amen that you don't ask for exactly god's not going to give you anything amen that you don't you don't you don't cry out for amen what did the children of israel amen when they were in egypt it was when they a man cried out amen god said i heard their cries amen when they got to a desperate position in their life amen well we can't take it anymore lord you promised us something amen and now we're ready to receive it and that's when god came on the scene amen exactly right praise god and that's how we're going to amen we're going to receive from god until we get to that point amen that the word is so precious unto us and just how we're going to read in just a little bit how when the children of israel amen when they were in babylon and they came back they had forgotten a lot about the word of god amen and we're going to read that here in just a moment i want to get ahead of myself praise god but if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen amen well i thought when we first come into the message we know the truth when you believe that serpent seed and when you believe that that that the baptism in the name of lord jesus christ and all those things you you were in the truth praise god i'm in the message i know the truth amen amen but as if you continue in my word amen because many people you know many people now amen they believe this this message amen but they only believed it with their head right they had their their head turned amen but they didn't have their heart turned right and that's two different things amen amen what did malachi 4 come to do amen to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers amen and so we trust amen that that is that is each and every one of us amen that we've had not just our heads turned to have a bunch of head knowledge amen right to debate amen whether this is right or not amen amen but to have that word amen so in in in us amen that it it'll change us amen as we're living day to day amen this word should change us praise god amen praise the lord so and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen amen how much freedom amen as you're growing in christ amen and you're growing in christ how much freedom it is amen to one day man have that body change amen amen and that that you can have that revealed amen to you amen even before it actually takes place amen praise god and can't only do that unless you're in the word praise the lord amen so i appreciate god and i appreciate amen uh what he's doing in each and every one of our lives amen amen now we're going to do we're going to do have here just a little bit a little little quiz here for just a moment so i'm going to let you all participate so you all don't fall asleep on me because i can already see some of you all dimming down on me now trust me i i do this i do the same thing too and uh and especially if i've eaten dinner right before coming to a wednesday night service it's tough amen but you just pray for us amen i want to do this for for a reason i want you to tell me i'm going to ask you all a series of questions and if you want to whoever wants to answer them quickly go ahead and answer okay who was thrown into a den of lions everybody knows this daniel your little kids know that amen question number two what what in the bible when it says it says what what is the beginning of wisdom the fear of the lord amen amen question number three says which angel appeared to mary gabriel question four which two people walked on water peter and jesus another question what was christ's first miracle turning that water into wine amen a couple more questions who had a coat of many colors joseph how many books are there in the entire bible amen you guys are smart whose tomb was christ buried in amen joseph of arimathea that's right two more questions how many people were in noah's ark eight people that's a good number number eternity ten what is the golden rule now for a long time i used to hear that and i thought that was just a a a a saying of man but actually that's in matthew 10 7 12 right amen he just says do unto others do to others what you want them to do to you amen praise god so uh i see that you all are very smart and that you all know some at least at least those 10 questions of the word amen least that amen most people can probably can probably answer those questions amen but i want to i want you to know amen that doing bible quizzes and doing knowing just the the the the word amen in that in that way amen does not guarantee or does not amen to say that that you have the word inside of you amen just because you carry a bible in your hand amen does not guarantee amen that you're living a life with christ amen because i tell you what a lot of people in the world in the in the world who went to sunday school when they were little kids could probably answer those questions but that does not guarantee you have a personal relationship with christ that does not prove amen that christ is dwelling within you amen and that the holy spirit has taken over amen that does not guarantee that one bit that's just head knowledge and i'm afraid that that's exactly amen what a lot of people in this message have right just a bunch of head knowledge i'm convinced of that right amen but how important it is amen as jesus said amen to continue in the truth continue in my word amen continuing in my word is not just memorizing little quizzes like this amen or little trivia amen but it's amen finding yourself in the scriptures amen finding the person of jesus christ amen in the word amen and as you as your as you want to know more about him amen you're finding yourself more in the word praise god amen and and i remember when i first come into the uh coming to this word amen and uh and god from a from a young from a young age at 12 years old you know i was i was uh i was reading uh jehovah's witness books you know because at the time we were jehovah's witnesses and i would sit there and read the watchtower magazine and all those things now how many how many kids are 10 11 12 years old you see them reading things like that but i didn't know it was just god amen just calling just just drawing me does something wanted me to want something in me wanted to know more about the bible and so i would lay down amen when some of the kids were in there playing video games and things like that i was just laying down on the couch amen reading a tower magazine don't get me wrong i used to play video games and all those things as well amen but and then god amen uh when we when we switched over from the jehovah's witness to the baptist church i mean i came to that realization that i needed salvation in my life and that's when i accepted the lord jesus as my savior amen and from there we started growing amen and and and it's just god amen just leading you through amen and you don't understand how how it works from one from one point to another amen and all of a sudden amen you come to realize amen that uh that the word has been opened amen and and then in 1999 when i went to columbia south america amen there was a cousin of my mother there who who had who had knowed the message and he started telling us about the message amen and he started telling us about these things amen there and god sent a prophet and all these things and of course to us as the baptist at the time we thought it was strange but you know for for us amen we didn't we didn't reject the stuff until we we came in and searched it out ourselves right and i'm so i'm i'm thankful amen that even the pastor down there in in colombia he he told us he said i can't let you all go back to the united states until i let you uh tell you about these things so i appreciate the lord and i thank god for doing that amen but um and so you you have all these things and you realize well all these all these truths are in the word amen but then all of a sudden amen it comes a point in your life amen where you can have all these things in your head amen but you're real you're wondering why is my life amen why is my christian life amen so so so damn amen why is my christian why am i not progressing with christ i know the truth i know i know these revelations these great things amen and you and you wonder and you think amen why is it well it's because amen sometimes we slack amen we slack on staying in the word amen and reading what and reading and and praying the way we should and i'll be the first one to raise my hands amen i believe we need more of that amen i believe we need amen more uh uh uh uh um it should it should it should sadden us amen to think amen that we don't have that we go one day without reading the word it should sadden us amen that we can go amen some of us can go amen a whole week amen not going to church sadden us to go one whole week and not reading the word amen the bride of christ desires amen that word because that's the only thing that the soul can feed upon amen praise the lord so i just appreciate the lord for that amen so doing these bible quizzes and all these things don't prove amen that the word is dwelling in you amen exactly it's just dwelling in here but not in you amen to change you amen i was looking at um i was looking at a uh at a census at a it was it was a group called the barna group amen they released the results of a survey they commissioned by the american bible society called the state of the bible six trends for 2014. this was done earlier this year and it's it's pretty amazing amen how the decline of the people here in the united states as a whole have no reverence for the scriptures whatsoever i'm just going to read you just a few things here amen um one of them was that bible skepticism is now tied with bible engagement amen this year's i'll just read this is this year's research reveals that skepticism towards the bible continues to rise for the first time since tracking began bible skepticism is tied with bible engagement the number of those who are skeptical or agnostic toward the bible who believe that the bible is just another book of teachings written by man that contains stories and advice has nearly doubled from 10 percent to 19 percent of the population of the united states in just three years in just three years this is now equal to the number of people who are bible engaged who read the bible at least four times a week and believe it is the actual or inspired word of god and um another thing that was interesting that people are less likely to view the bible as sacred in 2011 11 it was 86 now in 2014 79 bible ownership remains strong but readership remains weak i was shocked at this and and and i know this is the truth because in my household i have i have these many i'll just read this here 88 of household on a bible here in america 88 and uh the average number of bibles per household is 4.7 it's almost five bibles per household amen but 37 percent of americans read it once a week or more and some of us they may have 10 or more we have them in our in our phones and everything now and we still don't read them we take them with us everywhere we go and we still don't engage in the word right with shame on us amen 56 of americans they remain pro-bible uh this is people who believe the bible is the actual or inspired word of god uh with no errors amen so it's still 56 percent of people um one of the things that that that that seems to be causing the people to read the bible less is distraction and vision business uh is what's causing the people to read the bible less it says what keeps the people from reading the bible they own like all other forms of an analog media the bible is pushed to the side in part because people are just too busy too busy to read the word amen when when there was people amen that died for this word at one point in time people that died amen for this we're trying to translate the scriptures amen into other languages um i know that even in in in south america and colombia where i'm from they don't even have all the messages that brother branham preached amen they only have maybe about three or four hundred of them or so and uh they treasure those messages right amen well you know we ride in the car and then we have them sitting in between our couch seats and uh tapes laying under our bed and things like that and and we don't think anything of it but i tell people overseas amen they treasure these things amen they treasure this word amen again is shame on us i include myself in that because here in america we're just spoiled i just put it the way it is we're spoiled we're spoiled physically we're spoiled spiritually as well as far as far as you know this word there's no excuse amen we have no excuse whatsoever among those who say the their bible reading decreased in the last year the number one reason was busyness 40 report being too busy with life's responsibilities job family etcetera an increase of seven points from just one year ago other factors americans cite as reasons for less time reading scripture include a significant change in their life seventeen percent becoming atheist or agnostic and we're seeing that a lot more and more right people just saying forget about it there's no god but they don't understand that they have a soul within them they're gonna have to answer for one day anyways you can say you don't have god in your heart all you all you want there's no god but there's a soul in you still that you're going to have to answer for exactly right becoming atheist or agnostic 15 going through a difficult experience that caused them to doubt god 13 and seeing that reading the bible made very little difference in someone else's life most people still come to the bible to find intimacy with god but increasingly more people come looking for just answers to life's questions again that's what people want they just want quizzes right they just want trivia amen out of the out of the bible amen even i think it was last year uh this jeff foxworthy came out with a show something about uh uh some bible trivia and it was it was a nationally known show yeah i don't know how popular it become but it's becoming popular amen the trivia of tr having knowing knowing the trivia of the bible is is a popular thing now you see a lot of these bible movies that are coming out a lot nowadays you know people that go they watch that and they think wow you know i'm engaged i'm i'm looking at the bible i'm watching i'm watching the bible right amen that doesn't mean you're engaged in the word amen i'm almost done here in 2011 64 said that the bible brings me closer to god and in 2014 56 say that now the bible brings me comfort or helps solve my problems 26 percent said that in 2011 and that's now increased to 32 percent so again showing that people amen all they want is just trivia right they want th they just want that answer that quick answer to life's questions amen it's like god is is a spiritual google you know yeah lord tell me amen about this what did uh uh what was the color of the bush that that moses you know uh uh was in the uh when he saw up in the mountain i'm just making that up you know oh okay i'm good to go i did my my religion for the week you know amen we engage in the word saints right amen we we and and i say this saints amen because you know i'm getting ready to leave and and i may not have another opportunity to speak until after i come back but starting the new year saints i i i committed myself amen to engage myself in the word even more amen and i trust that you do as well amen because uh this is the only thing that's going to help us get out of here right engage in the word engage in that word amen how am i going to grow in christ amen read the bible in prayer your day that's something that sounds like something very difficult does it that's how it needs to be done and as you enter into that word amen god will reveal yourself to you even more and more amen and i know each one of us know that but it's so easy amen for us to just get sidetracked amen for the things that we need to do that really matter in life we get so sidetracked with well i got to take care of this i got to do this we got to go here we got to go there amen and god is put in a corner somewhere amen and put on a shelf somewhere and and and and when we think about him again amen we've already lost so much amen praise god second timothy 3 16 tells us all scripture is given by inspiration of god all scripture amen i like that and it's profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness why that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works amen amen thoroughly perfect amen does that mean that you're not going to make a mistake amen uh you'll make mistakes amen you'll fall in this flesh amen amen but you i mean you're you're you're you're heading towards perfection amen praise god thoroughly furnished unto all good works and you know so many times amen people come to us amen you know the only thing that we have amen in common with people out there and denominations and people out in the street is the bible they have no clue what you if you come to them and say brother branham said this and brother brown said that he tried to explain that to somebody out in the in in the mission field that don't know of amen from left to right hand amen the prophet said and amen that's the only thing that you're going to have in common with the people out here is the word and so if we engage less and less in the word amen how are you going to be able to speak to people when they when when when when they ask an answer of you amen that's why the bible says study to show that self-approved amen praise god brother branham says this here now some of you brethren remember in the old testament they had a way of finding out whether a prophet was telling the truth or a dreamer was dreaming right his dream was from god they taken him to the temple where the breastplate of aaron was hanging and it was called yurim thummim many of you people know about it reading in the bible and when this prophet began to prophesy and those supernatural lights didn't register back off of that like a rainbow crossed that making the urim thumb and from that breastplate no matter how real it sound they didn't believe it no surrey had to be answered back by god amen now the old testament was done away with and fulfilled right not done away but fulfilled and when it did we took a new testament now the old urim thumb and was back in the levitical levitical priesthood under aaron's breast amen right but this time we have two more tables of law the new and old testament and that's god's urine thumb to me if god doesn't speak back through his word when we see something then i just leave it alone amen you can have the greatest revelation and it sounds really good amen but if that word is not speaking back to you if you can't place it in the word anywhere amen you better leave that thing alone exactly right amen because it's going to get you in trouble it's going to get you in trouble and it's going to end up confusing you even more and we know that we don't serve a god of confusion if god doesn't speak back through his word when we see something then i just leave it alone but as long as it's it's as it's the word amen then i know that heavens and earth will pass away but his word will never fail therefore i believe the bible to be the absolute truth of god and it isn't to be added to or taken away from what but what but just lived preached in its simplicity amen lived the way it's wrote and god is if he ever was god he's still god and if this is his word and he made a promise that he cannot back up then he isn't god right amen as i said last night amen i could bank my soul amen on this word of god amen amen i don't care how many people are falling like flies amen how many how many big time preachers are fallen amen i will beg my soul amen on this word amen because we know we i believe i serve a god who cannot lie amen and if he's brought me this far amen i know that his word will continue to lead me to amen on praise god amen so let's i want us to all turn to uh and i think they'll just bring it up here real quick nehemiah chapter eight i want you to to look at this story real quick and uh nehemiah chapter 8. this was when after israel had come back from being in babylon and i can't remember how long they were in babylon but they were in babylon for a long time and they had forgotten amen about the a lot of them had forgotten about the traditions and the things that they had that god had given them amen in the word and then starting at verse 1. i just want to take this here just a moment it says and all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the watergate and they spake unto ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of moses which the lord had commanded to israel i want you to notice is that it was the people that was crying out for this exactly right it wasn't ezra they went out amen the bible doesn't say that ezra went out to give it to the people but it was the people asking ezra amen for this amen and verse two and ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of man and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the first day of the seven months seventh month and he read therein before the street that was before the watergate from the morning until midday before the man and the women and those that could understand and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law and i like what it says and the ears of all the people all the people were attentive unto the book of the law so that means that not none of them were sleeping none of them were looking at the time and seeing when ezra was going to stop reading none of them were looking going getting up going to the bathroom in the middle of the reading no no we're doing none of that amen they were very attentive amen unto the book of the law verse 4 and ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the perp for the purpose and beside him stood mathithaya and shima and ananiyan urja and hilkiah and maisia on his right hand and on his left hand padaya and michel and malkia and hashem and hashbadana and zechariah and michelin and ezra opened the book in the side of all the people for he was above all the people now doesn't mean that he was just he was above but i mean he was standing the pulpit was high so he was standing amen he was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up amen now these people amen they had not been with the word with the law for a long long time and they came to a point where they missed that word now you and me get it every single day right you and me get it every single sunday every single wednesday you may get it and we just imagine if god put us in this position amen where we're not hearing amen his word for exactly 500 600 years or whatever the time frame that these people were away from the law amen and ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people he was above all the people and when he opened all the people stood up and ezra blessed the lord the great god and all the people answered amen amen with lifting up their hands and they bowed their heads and worshipped the lord with their faces to the ground right it was a time of worship when that word was opened up amen also jeshua bani and sharabaya jamin akube shabathai hadija messiah khalida azaria joseph hanan pelaya and the levites caused the people to understand the law amen amen so it wasn't just a one-man show it was several people involved and amen to make sure that the people were understanding the law amen amen that's why teaching amen is very important amen exactly right and that's why i appreciate amen and if we have a little time i want to show a little just a little bit about when we went to the philippines last year but you pray for brother wade amen as he heads to the philippines here in just a few months because i believe they will benefit from his ministry amen from that ministry they need a lot of teaching over there amen so you pray for brother wade that the lord is just using amen but just to actually sit there and work with the people amen to make sure that they understand amen caused the people to understand the law and the people stood in their place so they read in the book in the law of god distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading verse 9 in nehemiah which is the tishita and ezra the priest the scribe and the levites that taught the people said unto all the people this day is holy unto the lord your god more not nor weep for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law amen they wept amen when this book amen was open to them right when this word amen was opened to them why because there's great things amen it wasn't just the word of a man it was the word of the lord amen and how many of you take that reverence state amen that that when this word when this bible this book is opened amen or even when brother dale comes up here and man brings you the word amen do you take that that state of reverence amen the lord amen i appreciate your word so much i thank you god for the revelation of jesus christ amen i thank you amen for sending man amen that can preach the word of god amen and that labor day and night amen just to bring us the word amen praise god something to look forward to in this coming year amen for all the people when they heard the words of the law amen verse 10 then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy unto our lord neither be ye sorry for the joy of the lord your strength amen so you take you receive this word amen and you just don't keep it for yourself amen you want to share it with somebody else amen praise god that joy amen the joy that you receive amen when you come around the word of god amen that's why i love bible study i i i appreciate amen in bible studies amen i i i you know it just it just causes amen something in me amen it just excites me amen to be able to hear amen more of the word get get dig into that word amen glory praise god amen why because remember we are the people of the open book right amen this book was open here amen the people were excited about it praise god neither be ye sorry for the joy of the lord is your strength amen so the levites stilled all the people saying hold your peace for the day is holy neither be ye grieved and all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great mirth because they had understood the words that were declared unto them amen it's exciting amen right the word should excite us and on the second day we gather together the chief of the fathers of all the people the priests and the levites unto ezra describe even to understand the words of the law amen and they found written in the law which the lord had commanded by moses that the children of israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month so that's going back they realized that the uh the feast of tabernacles amen something that they had forgotten right and that they should publish out and proclaim in all their cities and in jerusalem saying go forth unto the mount and fetch olive branches and pine branches and myrtle branches and palm branches and branches of thick trees to make boots as it is written so the people went forth and brought them and made themselves boots everyone upon the roof of this of his house and in their courts and in the courts of the house of god and in the street of the watergate and in the street of the gate of ephraim and all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths and sat under the boots for since the days of jeshua the son of nun unto that day had not the children of israel done so so it wasn't until jesus that when jesus had brought him out amen or they crossed over amen they had not done this amen or practice the feast of tabernacles amen and there was very great gladness amen also day by day from the first day unto the last day he read in the book of the law of god and they kept the feast seven days and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly according to the manner amen praise god glory bro so that means they had church every single day amen i know in foreign foreign countries amen sometimes they have six services a week or something related to church amen imagine if we went that way how many of us would be complaining and how many of us would be amen we should be excited about this word when we have the opportunity amen to be gathered with brothers and sisters the like person's faith to hear the word that should excite us amen praise god amen i'm not i'm not saints i'm not i'm not uh i'm speaking to myself as well amen because i i i need this just as much as you do amen praise the lord because sometimes it's so easy to just get caught up in routines the routine of the service and the routine of of uh you know of how things are done amen and and and we just get caught up in the routines of life amen and the word of god has no effect on us anymore i already know that you know amen but are you living it right that's the thing you might know it but are you living it praise god john 5 37 tells us and the father himself with which has sent me hath born witness of me ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent him he believe not search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me amen so the word will never lead you to nobody else but to him amen to himself and you will and you will not come to me that you may you might have life amen ii timothy tells us of these things verse 14 of these things uh of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the lord that they strive not about words to no prophet but to the subverting of the hearers study to show thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth amen you should know amen we should all know how to explain amen uh serpentine through the scriptures we should not explain water baptism amen by just the word amen well we were lying man again on brother branham said brother branham said brother branham said and that's not going to lead somebody to the lord right that's not exactly right the word is the only thing that you have in common with the people out there amen amen the word is the only thing that's going to be able to win them amen praise god then they'll understand amen the further revelation amen that god sent a prophet and things like that amen i i believe it that way amen praise god but shine profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness amen praise god brother branham says here brother we've made we've weighed a past the borders the mercy until there is nothing left but judgment but the righteous will not have to be punished with the unrighteous god will come and jesus will redeem his church and we'll go up in the air to meet him and it will be far beyond any bombs or any troubles and will be protected during that time look what it says here so children back to your god quickly don't tangle with the world for anything stay out of this modern world stay out of these modern theologies amen even in the ranks of this message amen because i'll say this the message itself amen can't be denominated but people have made it a denomination exactly right i have seen it personally and i know i'm sure brother dale has too i have experienced people have denominated this this message amen and set little little little little little uh you know clans and things amen and if you don't belong to this here i mean you're not part of us amen that's a shame so children back to your god quickly don't tangle with the world for anything stay out of this modern world stay out of these modern theologies just look to the lamb of god and watch what a shocking thing brother branham says here read your bible and pray all the time amen you know that's a very easy thing to say but that's one of the hardest things for us to do as christians don't be weary be rejoicing happy for the redemption of the church has drawn nigh when we shall see him who died for us amen praise god amen so saints let's take the word as it is right let's be excited amen in this coming year amen you pray pray for your pastor amen and you and you get excited about this word because saints amen and so brother brother wade he's going to be preaching a series about stature of the perfect man amen praise god and that's the only way that you're going to continue growing amen in that stature amen staying in that word amen and the word amen is the only thing that can change us amen praise god and the holy spirit if the holy spirit is dwelling in you it can only feed on but just the word that's the only thing it can grow it can it can it can feed on amen to help you to grow it's the word itself amen praise god brother branham um i'll just close with this amen so i can get here into this this little presentation real quick but uh but terence i might i might end up going over tonight so amen praise god amen but uh brother branham brother branham it was interesting that when brother branham preached the uh the the seventh seal amen and uh he had preached the six seals and i believe it was a sunday morning a sunday morning i preached i think he preached the seventh seal and you know a lot had already been said a lot had had already been been been brought forth amen but what brother branham brings in amen brings forth amen and he tells the people and encourages the people amen is that and i'm just sort of paraphrasing him and what he said because i have it all written here but i just don't have all full time to read it but he's told he tells the people he says i know there's going to be a lot of questions are going to arise a lot of people are going to try to go off trying to explain this what had already been preached amen in the last last six services and he said but you just leave that leave that leave that alone amen don't go try to explaining it uh your own don't go try to run off amen with the thing because why it's gonna get you in more trouble amen and uh uh and i believe and it was interesting amen that that he said something like that amen when when such a great revelations and such great things amen was coming forth and this is what what he says here towards the end of the of the script you can read it in the in the uh questions and answers on the seal uh that was that sunday morning towards the end of all that he says he says uh let me see here i'll just start on down down at the bottom at 6 16 it says and so but if the church you're not supposed to know these things so don't put no interpretation to anything amen see you just go ahead and just remember what you're told live a christian life amen go to your church be a real light wherever you are and just burn for christ and tell the people that how you love him right but you can't do that if you're not in the word right you can't do that if you don't go to church amen be a real light wherever you are and just burn for christ and tell the people that how you love him and just let your testimony be with love all the time with the people because if you don't you twist yourself out into something there and then you're you're off the beaten track and how many people how many things would have been avoided if they would have just taken this advice for brother branham amen how many doctrines that have rose up since that time would have been avoided if they would have just taken this thing amen that brother brown was telling see every time you try to do it you've done that see so you so just don't don't try to make no interpretation and especially tonight when that seal becomes up in front of you see just don't try to interpret you just go ahead and just be humble and go right on with the same plain message amen now you say brother branham is that we be in the church of the living god shouldn't we well as i was trying to look here i want to say why can't i out to have no no i don't you remember i'm saying this for you good see i'm saying all right so that you'll understand amen so he tells him it's such a great thing amen such a great thing that god did in this our day amen to open back amen the seals amen to break those seals and to reveal them to us amen and this is and this is what brother branham is telling us to do amen praise god i believe a lot of preachers amen wouldn't have been in so much trouble if they would have just taken that advice amen but because we want to uh uh prove our own thing and we want we have our own agendas that we want to prove amen we get in trouble amen when we just don't take god amen in simplicity amen that doesn't mean amen that that you ca that you're you're simple and just and you don't get in the word amen you get in the word amen praise god and uh so that's i i just encourage you all amen as this new year's coming saints to just get excited about the word of god glory amen amen don't don't just take church as a routine amen and don't just take church amen that well brother dale will always be there and brother wade will always be there and uh amen but one of these days amen if the lord tarries brother dale may not be with us exactly brother wade amen as mortals amen we gotta have to go sometime right what are we gonna do then amen if you're not in the word yourself amen bradel's not you're gonna not get in because we're hanging on brother dale's coattail amen absolutely not you're not going to get in on hanger brother wade's coattail amen you're going to get in amen because you had a personal relationship with christ and his word thank you lord amen the holy ghost dwelling in you amen living that life through you praise god amen so some of you are probably wondering i didn't know he was that hard well i was soft last time now i had to get a little tough last this time amen nah i i need that two saints all that i need myself because i get slack amen and and and even some people think that ministers don't struggle amen we struggle too amen we're flesh and blood just like you that's why we need your prayers amen praise god so i certainly covet your prayers as we'll be heading out here in just a couple of weeks we'll be heading to canada have um we weren't planning on going to canada but as you all know my mother-in-law had this tumor and uh and thankfully it's been removed we want to spend some time with the family so uh we're we're going to be in canada and another reason why is because since i'm leaving tour to nicaragua i'm first heading to costa rica on january 1st we'll be there for four day meeting and then from costa rica we'll be flying uh to nicaragua and we'll be there for about 15 days so you remember us in prayer we're supposed to hold uh quite a few meetings and um and um as well as uh be uh we're gonna be like 10 hours up in the mountains in nicaragua where uh brother mike siebert told me that uh they don't have any electricity up there or anything amen so uh so you remember us in prayer amen the lord would just have his way and uh i like the song that brother royle soriano from from the philippines he wrote and he said and the song goes just to be a blessing i'll go on a journey climb up the highest mountain and cross the deep blue sea amen it's just to be a blessing amen and uh cause sometimes you just don't know amen you might just be there just for one person amen but it'll be worth it all amen and that's all i want to do amen just to be a blessing amen praise god so you remember us in prayer lord willing we'll be back around january 22nd or so amen and uh um just pray for us pray for our family the lord would just give us a prosperous trip amen i believe he will amen praise god now brother brother anderson if you want to bring up the uh i know last year when i ministered here uh right before i left to the philippines i know some of you all helped in me getting there and i really appreciate that and uh with your love offerings and and things and so i i had created this this powerpoint presentation last year but i didn't get to show it amen here at the uh here to the church and so i figured since brother wade is going to be heading over there pretty much almost traveling about the same same way that that that i'm going to be i figured he might like to see this as well so so um so real quickly uh i just want to so here go ahead and next slide brother brother anderson let's quickly how much time do we have brother dale all right hey man so um uh just a little facts on the philippines uh go ahead brands uh there are currently over 7 000 islands there the total population of the entire philippines as of 2011 is over 94 million the 12th is the 12th most populated country in the world the capital is manila which is located on the largest island of the philippines called luzon and you see manila right up right up there the total population of just metro manila as of 2010 which is more now it's about 12 million that's just one city now it's probably bigger now in 2014. 12 to 13 hours ahead in time their time their time and depending on daylight savings time so right now it's 8 25 here it's it's 8 25 in the morning over

when i went down to another island down in palawan now when i was there in in indang i was invited to minister the uh the the youth camp they had they hold their every single year and uh there were i'd say with the adults and everything just youth there were probably over over 650 young people there probably with adults that were there i'd say maybe 750 or so so we definitely had a good time amen and several uh several ministers uh preached and i preached about three services there that week by the grace of the lord we were able to go back to the previous slide brother brother anderson we were able to see 42 souls 42 cells saved amen and baptized in the name of lord jesus christ and this is just the only picture amen that we have of them baptizing some of them right there amen if you can see that go to the next slide brother anderson the theme of the of this of this of this uh uh uh of this camp was keeping up the victory and uh so i'll know y'all know brother danny del mundo he was the one who was responsible of it you see some of the people there next slide brother um you can click play this is a video here i don't know if there's audio but it's out of order but in the wrong season you know i like to use uh props and stuff like that so i had the young people over here amen blindfolded here and uh i was trying to bring a an example to that amen how we we can get young people and get so blindfolded by just different types of blinders in life i don't think that audio's playing go ahead next slide friday march 29th uh i that was in i spoke that morning this was in the evening service um brother uh um brother ray soriano which is brother wells brother preached that night preached a wonderful message amen this was the altar call well young people amen they

brother royale just praying for the people amen we had a good time amen go to the next slide brother and now click play here now pause this for just a moment this here after after the the camp one night they had this thing keeping up the victory so they used uh like the prophets amen different prophets and different great man of god throughout the bible and they had this thing where that they did where when fire came down and consumed the altar of elijah's altar amen so they they kind of replicated it here and what they did is they tied they tied on a string something burning it was at night time with a fireball coming down and they ignited you'll see it was really nice go ahead and play it so they were just involved you know uh they weren't just uh all around just doing just doing uh you know we had time of leisure as well but that they they had their times that they're very creative and go next slide brother all right so i wasn't at the kitchen at the time although they asked me to do i would have been in the kitchen i don't know how the food would have come out but but the farewell service that days i ministered on serving in victory and uh i used that that uh that uh that as a prop and i use a little babies bib as well as a prop maybe one day i'll preach it here amen the next uh the next sir uh the service that was easter sunday and uh ministered at brother royal's church that morning and then we had another service uh it was three churches that came together in antipolo and uh this brother right here he had just received the message amen his name is brother leo he's really excited about the word of god he was uh he wasn't he he was trained uh uh he was he's a theologian actually in the pentecostal church and uh he when brother royale was gonna baptize him hey man he told brother he asked brother brother well should i should i go with my collar amen with his collar that that he had i think he had a turnaround collar and he said well if you want to i'll baptize you with a turnaround collar it doesn't matter and he said you know what i'm not going to do it so you took that collar off and he threw it he gave that up and he's excited about the word amen it was a real blessing to meet him amen next slide then on april 1st we had a minister's meeting in chiapa which is brother uh brother uh uh it's the brother's name brother not brother danny the other brother but the nestor espanola's church and uh i spoke uh briefly at that at that uh at that meeting we had i'd say probably about 60 60 ministers or so there amen had a good time with him yeah we were uh yeah yeah it was up and down yeah i want you all to see just real quickly what common philippine traffic looks like it's towards the end where it gets better no tractor trailers no there's is this is like the equivalent of um i don't know but maybe riding on 985 two-lane highway but but but the traffic is so much you can't ride at the same speed at 985 and people uh and people look just jaywalking in the middle of i mean it's just you got a policeman there supposedly controlling things but he's just there on the sidelines there's not much he can do those are the gypnies that's right jeepneys they're a very popular former transportation in the philippines and you have your little car uh tricycles right there right here where we're heading to brother royale's uh house uh he lives over over back that way um there's another day walker thank you i'm in the middle of the road and now i want you to see how he makes this left turn no red light here comes a jitney here comes more cars first come first serve that's how it is and there's not a lot of accidents there's not a lot both times that i've been to the philippines i've only seen one accident and that was because the car had lost his brakes and he hit a a a uh he hit a car so that's that that's a side street right there and uh people take their time you know so all right you can stop it brother anderson just kind of get a little taste as to what what it's like the next day we met with brother mark duarte he's he's with worldwide missionary outreach uh he was there and so we had we had a little bit of fellowship with them they do a lot of work heavily in the philippines so it was nice meeting him amen and this uh that day just for you to get an idea of what lunch is like this is uh called esau this is barbecued pig intestines on a stick next next slide brother yeah chitlins go ahead hit play hit play brother i'm getting ready for esau some chicken intestines really those are barb those are pig intestines sister diane eat your heart out it's it's fir it's good when you first put it in your mouth but then it it tastes like it tastes like manure actually afterwards the way it smells in the pig pan that's how it tasted like it go ahead brother for that it was good because of the barbecue at first it was nice and sweet but then if you continue chewing it tastes like well brother wait it's ready for you april 2nd we had the evening service at brother uh um brother nestor espanola's church um this is his family he's got a one two three four about six children and uh we had a really good time there amen next slide go ahead brother anderson um then on april 3rd we were in koloakan city this is where brother danny's church is located at this is his church some of his youth singing and this uh very interesting about this area is that it used to be a very heavy leper colony and that's where they held a lot of lepers and uh brother royal and brother danny and some of these other brothers they would actually go to these leper colonies and minister to these people yeah yeah okay i didn't know that and uh so so that they that's impressive and this is just some other church singing you can skip this brother just for the sake of time all right on april 4th is when we headed out to palawan now palawan is one of the islands further one of the further farther south islands in the in the philippines or the string of islands it's very uh interesting uh because that that island is receiving the word amen quite heavily they um a lot of denominations coming out amen and about 32 churches just in that island amen so brother royal is working very very heavily in that area and uh we left 5 30 in the morning to palawan it was about an hour flight and it took us about four to five hours travel time total to get to our destination the flight was just an hour but then we still had to travel about four hours in in in vehicle next slide so this is palawan right down here and uh go ahead and hit the next one travel from manila to palawan and then this is a close-up of the island palawan we end we landed in puerto princesa and then from there we went to uh um i

this right here this is his daughter i think is getting married and his his future son-in-law was making that house right there near where they were living now building that from scratch amen so beautiful view right there they just they're right there in the ocean amen so that's brother armando right here he is he's about 60 64 years old i believe so 66 something but that brother has he had more strength than i had i mean he just kept going and going he traveled everywhere we went and uh brother is amazing that's his little church there and that's that's his little church there next slide uh this is just uh quickly uh this is called the uh the underground river oh this is the seventh the one of the seven wonders natural wonders of the world and uh it's a cave with these limestone formations the river goes right into it as soon as you're going in it there's bats flying everywhere and uh it's just really really interesting but it's really beautiful once you get in there's complete darkness we went in about a mile and a half in and then we turned around and came back uh it was just for sight sightseeing amen next slide when you go in there as you're going in you can just get a whiff with a whiff of bat feces you know it just just hits you amen but it's one of the it's a very visited spot uh there we were in in sabang you're walking around and you're riding here you're walking around in the area and there's just monkeys just walking right next to you you know just everywhere i had one and i have another video of one it snapped it snapped uh i got too close

oh us and then from there we we came down here and uh this is idawan you know one and uh we were traveling uh we traveled we had to get to a point where a bus took us there there was about a 45-minute bus ride and then from there we got on these motorcycles and rode 30 minutes to our destination on these motorcycles next slide play that i wasn't riding upside down but you're gonna get an idea as to uh sort of the terrain i don't know why it's upside down anyways next slide play this one and see brother and all right so here's one let me tell you 30 minutes on that little motorcycle and you have a little piece of luggage right in front of you that puts a hurting on you better believe it again brother wade this is where they're gonna might take but it you know but just the views are some of the views are just breathtaking you know they're just so beautiful and um there's brother royal and so there's just dust just dust all over your eyes and i don't even know how i got that video with all that dust coming in my eyes but next slide brother that night after we got there we uh uh we had dinner with the brethren brother uh this this was brother uh uh uh the pastor's i forgot his name

o'clock when we were there about to 11 o'clock at night they just uh had a good time though amen just to quit real quickly it's a little song service i don't know why it's sideways it's supposed to be amen um this is when we were leaving um you play that real quickly we were leaving the people there and uh not leaving the philippines we were just leaving that area and uh had a great time with the people there next slide brother all right so from there we went on to tai tai go ahead and hit next and that was about an hour and a half or so right next from no i wasn't in a car in a van next next one these are the boats that brother wade might be getting on um this is it was about there was about seven or eight of us on just that little boat right there in the middle of the ocean too traveling about 45 minutes island hopping from one island to the other you know uh and it wasn't you know it wasn't for pleasure it was just we had services as you'll see here and the next slide i'll tell you more but you know we're just running out of time just go ahead and hit play on this brother this is so you can kind of get an idea of what it looks like riding in the middle of the ocean in one of these just beautiful all right you know this waters these waters are so blue you know it's just beautiful amen go ahead brother and i wouldn't mind living there that's just so beautiful amen we stopped at this brother's house and uh this is the little babies where they where they sleep we had a little stopping point and uh we just a real quick testimony the brothers they were in control they were you know riding the boat with us the pasture there in this area he he's a deep sea diver and uh he um brother royal had uh had uh had asked if it was possible when we go down there is it possible that you can maybe get some lobsters for for for us and the brother told him he said brother at this time of the year it's really difficult to find lobsters in this area and he said but i'll do my best now i believe the brother had a desire because he really wanted to um he wanted to serve us you know and he said that he prayed to the lord and he went to an area that he had never fished before but he said but he said he he felt led to go that way and he went down there and three three over three other of the divers went down there with him he stayed up at the top of the boat and they were these little helmets with the little light right and they put these traps in the bottom of the ocean and when they when they placed the trap uh one of the brothers said the brother the pastor said that he saw three lights and all of a sudden he saw a fourth light in there somewhere he said there was no bow anywhere and it was nothing like that well when they came they they left the traps there and they came and picked us up and we we we got there to this area where they had set the traps at and there was five lobsters in that in that in that thing and one of them was big too now this is a the brother said he had never fished lobster in that area before and it was out of season i believe god gives you the desires of your heart amen when you're sincere amen next slide brother i think this is just a quick video of just one of them that that that we took it's huge so um and there was a couple more in there one of them's like a king lobster so god god god will give you the desires of your heart amen he knows that he knows he knows why you're asking for things amen praise god next slide when we were riding back to the area where we were going to have service with the brothers there was a storm over here to the right and you'll see these waves started getting bigger and bigger we got to about four or five feet foot waves it's kind of scary but this is my first time ever doing this but these brothers and these boats it was nothing to them they had just cooked these uh these uh lobsters they boiled them in this little thing in the uh in water in the in the boat and we were there just right before we took off we were eating lobster and brother royal was still finishing up his lobster and you'll see here in just a moment boats rocking and things and brother rorell is just sitting there just eating lobster like it's not it's not bothering him one bit you'll see here in just a moment so uh and this is uh over here to the left that's the pasture there brother uh the long long okay go ahead brother angels when i met brother his name is brother long long long long and brother royal told me he said this is brother long long but you can call him long for short we got a kick out of that um when we when we when we stopped at the place where we were going to have service we couldn't take the boat all the way in so we had to get in in the middle of all that and and walk it off carrying our our things once you get closer to the shore it gets it's just dirty and a lot like trash and things like that and you have to walk all in that so i believe there was one part here where i think i saw something swimming in the water it looked like an eel or something we just kept going all right go ahead brother anderson that night we had services brother long long and they didn't have they don't have an actual church they they meet at his sister's house and was an interesting brother long long i preached i was going to preach a certain message that night and i felt led to speak on something else about about the treasures of the heart amen or finding where your treasure is where your heart is there your treasure would be also i didn't know that after the service brother long long uh through brother royal interpreting he said brother we really i really appreciate you ministering that he said because apparently brother long long he had he had backslid a few years ago and the reason why he had backslid was because he was trying they do a lot of treasure hunting in that area and uh he he he had backslid because of that and so it was a weakness in in in their life i had no idea and that's just how the lord leads amen amen we just i just thank god for that amen so from there uh we went that night uh to uh uh polly island uh keep going brother anderson that was where we were at where we preached the brother long lungs and then from there that night after the service we we rode about 45 minutes to another island in the middle of the night to pile island go ahead we had a service there that morning this church right here in pali island is the first message church in that island they had and they actually they just came in uh that's the pastor there there are pentecostals and they just received the word really excited about the word and brother royal he's working with these people and apparently from what they tell me i was i'm the first person outside of the philippines to come visit that island so i didn't know that so next next slide brother this is just real quick uh a little sing sing a little children singing at the church so go ahead next hand next slide bro i wish i had time to watch the rest though but we just don't have time go ahead play it's just me ministering amen and most importantly next slide to kind of get an idea uh this is some of the after the service this brother right here he attends the church there his brother i believe he's about close to 80 years old he doesn't look like he's got 24 grandchildren and he looks more robust than i do next slide brother they dry their fish out out there in the middle of the shore there and this is when we were leaving next slide hit play here we were leaving the island you fast forward a little bit brother anderson see if you can fast forward i don't know if it'll let you but anyways when we were heading back to taitai in the on this trip right here we were caught in like a middle of a storm in the middle of the ocean and i have some video of it big old you know dark rain clouds you know and waves lifting up and things but luckily thank god we we made it through there amen go ahead next slide brother when we got there um at our destination uh i was videotaping and uh because of the rain and everything and i saw this shot right here and i wanted to take that so i think this is where we end up so thank you very much for your prayers and support for us during this trip most of all we thank god and give him praise for great things he has done and god bless you i believe he he he still has great things in store amen those churches like you just saw right there um this is i made this for a sister at brother gene's church she hates to see these type of things so i made it just for her and uh let's eat squid uh go ahead and play that for them well it's upside down i'm about to uh put some squid in my mouth i guess it's the head portion right it's the head head with uh the eyes and uh a couple of other things yeah tentacles there you go that's pretty good it tastes like fish seafood seafood amen praise the lord you gotta have your fun times too amen so thanks you pray for us amen because uh i have a heart for the philippines and for mission work in general amen and uh so you pray for us as we're out out just trying to be a blessing amen pray for brother wade amen in a couple of months he'll be heading out doing the same thing probably you got to try the squid amen lord bless you all brother dale come here you mean you enjoy that amen you want we were a little bit more modernistic on the trip i took but we did get to see a lot of a lot of places a lot of things it was a lot of fun and i did get to go to the leper colony when i turned out a service right out beyond brother danny's and uh i enjoyed that because it was a to us you know and a time like i said you know i said when it said it i said there was no tractor trailers no big tractor trailers were allowed to run into town around manila except at night so if you're going anywhere you place five tractor trailers in a row to get back in line wide open that's a lot of fun to do but you tell our brother how much you appreciate him you want to say something yeah we uh years and years ago we were missionaries in one haven he made a statement a while ago uh right in that he enjoyed it and he believed that was his ministry and we had these other mission people eating maggots whatever you know it says don't feel sorry for us we enjoy we love it and so you are
