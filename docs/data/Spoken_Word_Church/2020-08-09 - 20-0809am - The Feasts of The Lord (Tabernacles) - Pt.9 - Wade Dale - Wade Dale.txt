========================================

[Music] shining in the light of your glory so pour out your power in love as we sing holy holy holy [Music] holy [Music] amen god bless you this morning good to see you now we've come not to see each other we come to see him worship him in spirit and in truth so god bless you good to be in the house of the lord today remember those that are not here the ones that are sick and we were looking up this quote and it took there was 95 quotes i was looking up to find one and it was the 93rd quote so the lord gives you patience but i want to read this to you i knew brother adam has said this so i put in some you know how you'll put in a string of words but you can't get them all together because they're not exactly the way sometimes we quote it so i put in you can win done all you stand stand do oh okay and now i finally got it shalom 1964. listen to this some people say but brother branham i've tried and i've tried but wait a minute patience is a virtue patience is holy spirit virtue they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength you say how can i wait any longer just keep on waiting when you've done all you can do to stand then stand see just stand how am i going to do it stand that's all i said stand exclamation point he said it's the truth and it's the truth he said it'll happen how i don't know but it will happen he said so he promised it if he promised it it's going to happen so now remember god took thousands of years to fulfill his promise of a coming savior four thousand years god took to fulfill that promise but he knowed from the beginning just when it was going to happen no one else knew but he knew and when it happened the people was such a delusion until they didn't know how to accept it the same thing if the same thing hasn't repeated today it always does never fails both sides so when you've all done all you can do stand all right where we're gonna go it's like kind of like job you know you where are you gonna go i didn't know and peter you know jesus just called him a devil and peter said well lord you can call me whatever you want to but where else am i going to go in other words what he was saying is there is the devil and there's you which way i'm not going that way i'm going toward you so we just we just need to have patience and stand also brother brown the greatest battle ever fought in 1962 he said when you've done all you can do to stand then stand because the bible tells us that what having done all stand amen so we just stand for the word of god god will do what he said he'll do amen all right by way of announcements brother aaron will be speaking at one o'clock this afternoon uh remember mom and dad they're going uh i think it's wednesday the 12th they will be going or the 13th one of the two days 11th somewhere in there tuesday or wednesday they're going for their covet test so let's pray that that thing becomes negative so that we can get uh get mom into the doctor and let them see what's going on with them with all of our sinuses all right i want to thank all of you that came friday i know some of you couldn't that's okay but for you i'm sure you watched it online there are on facebook live that was 140 something views so um people around the world sent their greetings to brother sister dale being married 62 years on friday and it cheered him up with the kids and adults singing and the kids playing playing the instruments so thank you for your effort it will not be forgotten so now wednesday um we'll have these here uh i'll be speaking wednesday uh and hopefully dad gets his test results back

aaron josiah brother richard brother josh brother gay krantz brother john duret that will be for wednesday it's basically the same i know we um it's hard for somebody like brother michael and them to get up here on wednesday so and brother ryan works odd hours so and brother kearns working too there on wednesday so give them some time and then let somebody else come so um god bless you we love you with the love of the lord let's turn our bibles to leviticus 23. we're going to be speaking today on the feast of tabernacles like i said before remember everyone oh also remember brother ron spencer he's going one day this week to they're gonna run the scan again on his brain and his and his lungs um for the uh supposed cancer so we're not we're gonna believe that all is well and everything's done good um brother nate and sister caitlin had a beautiful baby boy charlie the other day and it's had a few complications but uh according to what they're saying now the baby may go home in a couple of days so we thank god for that amen well kids are resilient man they're just so resilient you you look at them and you go man that that don't look good then a couple days later the kid's okay you know so he had a lot of bruising and and things uh going on sugar level was up so all of you that know i know you've been in prayer brother nate's a good friend of ours and a good minister in the gospel and been a friend since he was a kid so uh now he has kid so it makes you feel kind of old so anyway we're on the feast of the lord this would be part nine feast of tabernacles all right and this will be the last great feast um that we will be talking about and then what we'll do on wednesday is we'll do a little more review but we will also get into the there was three required feasts that all males m-a-l-e-s all males had to attend there was three feasts they didn't have to attend all seven but there was three that they were required as jews to participate in all right and we'll do those wednesday because to me it shows us in this day and it narrows everything down to those three feasts which they have a significance that's why god asked that that happened all right that they come to the feast and not come empty-handed they had to come with something all right so let's um leviticus 23 34. we'll read here in just a second let's bow our heads to heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us we thank you for the message of the hour lord we thank you for the reality of a living god that we can know that lord the world is looking for you to come and lord you will in a physical form but lord we're looking at that secret catching away we're looking at that thief in the night the one that comes and takes away his lovely bride right out from under the devil's nose and takes us lord over into another dimension just looking a few minutes ago of the pictures of brother moat and brother tatum and brother george canada and brother mike canada lord and just realizing one thing's for sure they're having a lot better time than we are and lord they are waiting to come back here father so that we can reunite with them lord and then our bodies will be changed these tabernacles that you've allowed us to live in lord through our time here on earth lord they're temporary lord but we know that what's inside is eternal and then the outside is going to be changed into the eternal and lord if we don't see you lord we've missed the whole we've missed everything lord if our eyes are not focused on you the the wonderful bridegroom lord lord we long for that day when we can stand there and talk to you lord face to face and lord we know as you said through your prophet that lord you waited for four thousand years before you could come as a little baby but that didn't bother you one bit lord you have patience like no other father i pray that you'll transfer that patience to us lord that we'll realize that you're in total control of this thing and satan has nothing but permitted power his only power he don't even have a power in a name but we have a power in the name of jesus christ the eternal son of the living god the eternal creator the god of the universe but lord you're also residing in our heart today this small tabernacle that we've been given from our birth of union between mom and dad we've all come that way father but lord we've grown up now to a place that that one inside of us lord must begin to take over and it only comes by the revealing of your word as brother bob was talking about wednesday night lord there's no other sensation lord we love those and we love the the different things and the little added bonuses we get but lord there's nothing like you revealing yourself through this word of god and and be sitting in a congregation and the word goes forth and something sparks in your heart and says that ain't nothing but the truth lord we know that those words were spoken many years ago by a little woman lord that just had childlike faith sister hattie wright when those words rang out lord there was something changed and father we pray today lord that that same one would come lord and change father not only change our body but change right now our thinking lord towards you for lord we pray that that then as we pray that that will be changed lord that it'll connect to the outside man and these old vile bodies will be changed lord we know that healing is temporary but lord the healing of the soul is eternal father as we go through this feast of tabernacles let us realize one thing's for sure we're going to live with you for an eternity in these tabernacles but lord there's a process in the journey that we have to go through first and we're going to continue through that today lord be with each one be the ones that are sick be with mom and dad lord keep them safe brother ron spencer lord the the list his brother taran said is so long lord of the people that that have been afflicted by this virus lord but you knew before the foundation of the world i was thinking yesterday lord you're the only one that has a bomb you're the bomb and gilead it's not a chemical it's not a uh it's not something that man can produce but it's lord is something what you are and we look toward that bombing gilead today father that that bomb will be placed on whatever sickness it doesn't matter lord you even told a little prophet that was born in sin and came on the earth and you anointed him to be a prophet in the end time you told him that cancer would not even stand before him lord while he was under that anointing lord we pray that anointing did not leave that anointing is here today and lord is an anointing that comes from us hearing listening and receiving the word of god so i pray that you would bless that time that we have now just for a moment and you'll be with us in jesus name amen all right feast of tabernacles leviticus 23 34 and we can if you want to get the chart ready we'll pull it up as soon as i get finished reading this and we'll just kind of review a minute speaking to the children of israel saying the 15th day now we're in the seventh month which is what october for them it's october because it starts in april october the 15th day of the seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days now we bring in seven days back in again all right we hadn't had seven days until back over the other feast all right because remember the feast of trumpets was a blowing of the trumpet then you had the day of atonement now you're coming back into something where we can type the church ages and we can type the seven spirits of god we can type the seven um virtues and all the different things so watch this on the first day shall be a holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord on the eighth day now we'll get into that in just a little bit on the eighth day that's not seven on the eighth day which is what the first day over again you've had seven days we've went seven sevens is 49 we've had 49 weeks we've had 49 years we've had all these different 49s but remember on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation so it's going to be outside of those seven days okay all right and that type something in just a minute we'll show it to you and on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you and you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord it is a solemn assembly you shall do no servile work therein these are the feasts of the lord which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations to offer an offering made by fire and to the lord a burnt offering and a meat offering a sacrifice a drink offering everything upon this day so in other words we are including everything now all right we've come down to the seventh church age we've come down to the seven seals we've come down to all the sevens that you want to talk about it's right here all right but now remember you and i you got to move over into an eighth day because eighth day is eternity all right come out of the feast but watch what we're doing here now look beside the sabbath of the lord and beside your gifts and besides all your vows and besides all your free will offerings which ye given to the lord this is a special time now watch verse 39 also in in the 15th day when you have gathered in the fruit now we're going to talk about in a minute we had one harvest of barley remember one harvest of wheat now we have a this is a harvest of corn and fruit just three harvests all right harvest the barley which was what feast of first fruits feast of pentecost was the two loaves of wheat and this is we're going to talk about today is corn and fruit because what it says right here when you have gathered in the fruit of the land you shall keep a feast unto the lord's seven days on the first day shall be a sabbath and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath and you shall take you on the first day the bowels of goodly trees and branches of palm trees and the bowels of fig trees now this is all white natural things not man-made natural things things that god has produced or the earth has produced all right and you shall rejoice before the lord your god seven days so you have to go outside in your yard and build your build a booth but symbolic all right and you shall take and ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees branches of palm trees boughs of thick trees willows of the brook and you shall rejoice and that's going to be a happy time i'm glad god put me in flesh because that's what he requires for redemption he required adam and eve to be in flesh and allowed them to fall so that he can be the redeemer because if you're born again today your soul doesn't need redemption you're you're already redeemed this is what needs redemption so he's telling them to go outside of their normal go build a booth lord we used to love to do it as kids me and terrence and some of the neighbors man we go build we it and there's no wonder we didn't get bit by something but we didn't and it was fun we had fun but look this thing they're going to have a you shall rejoice before the lord your god seven days and you shall keep it a feast unto the lord seven days in the year it shall be a statute forever in your generations you shall celebrate it in the seventh month you shall dwell in booths not just build it you've got to go dwell in it all right you shall dwell in booths seven days all that are israelites born shall dwell in boost that your generation may know that i made the children of israel to dwell in boots when i brought them out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god you may be seated in the lord's blessing because what happened during the 40 years we always think man 40 years the the the clothes never um you know they never got uh thread-bearing they never had to shod the shoes they didn't need walmart or k-mart or where they didn't need anything but you got to remember they lived in those tents for 40 years also so god preserved the tents for 40 years that they were living in because you we remember brother gary you've got a that big old uh ten of yours yeah i don't think it lasts 40 years if you but now remember they took it down and put it up every other day or two or every other week or every other month or even every other day they'd have to take that thing down pack it up put it on their animal and go to wherever god tells them to go to so that's the same thing see this thing right here this is your flesh satan beats on it because he has one hold on you and that's your flesh he has he knows that that thing came from sin it came from uh the cause that he caused in the garden all right that eve caused but satan was a part of it and he knows that he can have a part of that attachment to your flesh as we were talking to also if you pull the chart up when we talk about the two lows this is leaven we know leaven is sin but this is born in sin shape and iniquity this is not any good this is decaying it is rotting i'll promise you don't wear deodorant for a while don't ever try that not in a crowd maybe with social distancing but not in a crowd all right why because we're corrupt we are corrupt people in this so what does god have to do god has to clean the inside guy up first our problem is it's like bob was talking about wednesday you know you can do's and don't sit things to death this thing but if there's no re if the if the resident in the house is still the resident that made you do it before eventually you're going to just keep doing it you're going to hide you're going to try to you know you're going to try to hide it or or something but but when the holy ghost comes into your soul and cleans that thing out takes that desire that you had for doing those things away see then our body you know what think about this we live in this world we work we rub shoulders with humanity amen all the time we buy cars we buy houses we interact with let's think about this the other day we interact with the world we all do even maybe internationally with brother john doing the different things he does and all the different things that uh well y'all doing car lot you you interact all the time and when they look at you they look at you as well you're you know you're just a nice guy a nice looking guy you know you you dress well um but then you got to go deeper than that you see there's no earrings in our ear men no earrings in the women's ear then you keep going deeper and i know some of you may have got a tattoo before you came into the message and i'm not bashing tattoos but you're not all tatted up so they look at you a little different that way and then then you you continue through through your conversation with people listen if they don't walk away if they don't walk away and say there's something different about that person and sometimes they'll ask you you know like i got friends i tell them don't call me on sunday why we go to church too i say yeah y'all go like 30 minutes in the morning and you're back home by lunch so you watch football not now but but was able to before you understand what i'm saying and then we tell people we go to church and we're there pretty much all day and they look at you like huh a preacher preach an hour oh come on people good we got to show the world that we're different we can stand here and preach we can but look once we do come to the level that we have the baptism of the holy ghost and we come to church and we what we commune with god in the way that he wants us to commune with him not like the world that communes with him when they really are not communion with him you know who they're communing with the god of this evil age has inserted itself to be jesus christ i said he's inserted himself to be and then everything's okay but everything's not okay we have a level that we have to come to that no amount of sermon no amount of preaching is going to change somebody but your life will you could not say a word brother brown what'd he say he said live me a sermon so no matter of do's and don'ts and do all these different things bro that we did it forever and you just sat there and went on and did what you wanted to do didn't you right you still do what you want to do now right see it's a change but it just changed the way you look at it all right same way with all of us you know you i've always said you know you take this you take this tabernacle god didn't destroy it he cleaned it up this used to hold a bear this used to curse xyz put whatever you got in there amen god didn't cut the hand off and no he changed the what the guy in the control tower he changed it where i then listened to the correct watchman getting off my subject here but that part of it though part of it because you and i are now in the feast of tabernacles so what anything goes on has to go on it goes on in your tabernacle not this this is just a place we decided to come to that god tells us to assemble ourselves together all right but the great tabernacle that god's looking at is me and you now israel went through it by motion why because they didn't have the guy inside they didn't have the holy ghost when in leviticus they didn't have the baptism of the holy ghost to teach them and train them what to do they had to be taught and trained by the priest god gave it to moses moses gave it to the priest i read it says moses right here it says what speaking to the children of israel moses saying and he gave him a statute to do he gave him a statute right here on passover this was very important because you know what if you didn't make it past passover you died that's right same way with us you must have a passover amen or you're dead can you say no i'm alive i can work out and i can 60 years old that's pretty good it's dying eventually there'll be more down here than up here don't worry but you know what i told we were talking the other day some of us were listen how important your new birth is because brother branham tells us i'm on tabernacles but i'll get to it in just a minute that brother brown tells us that if you die a sinner you come up in that old same body because what would be the desire of i mean a sinner dies goes over into the fifth dimension and he's young again no that ain't gonna work because they haven't been changed see my change comes here brother my change started at the new birth so this 60 year old guy back when i was 38 years old 39 almost in january there in 1997 1998 in there 1999. i got the new birth i believe my soul was changed not exchanged but i believe i turned back to a new guy a new person my soul went back to that 18 year old why brother brown said god put a picture yes amen before the foundational world he took a picture in the album and he said that's my son that's my daughter these are all my children i know they're going to have to be born i know they might be 67 that 90 year old lady got born again and brother brown was meeting 90 years old she lived in sin if she would have died she would have come up a 90 year old woman because it don't change her soul her soul was still just getting as old as her body i'm just that's just me but when she went over that fifth dimension she wasn't happy i'll promise you that but brother tatum brother george brother mike brother moat all downstairs look at their pictures that's the youth you're gonna see because their soul was changed not exchanged the nature of that thing was changed and you turn back to an 18 year old child inside or 18 year old person inside i just believe that because of what brother brown said he said the center will raise in the body that they send in so they're going to raise in their old body no worth to that folks get born again i mean our tabernacles may be getting bad looking you know our bowels our bowels may be drooping down a little bit but god's going to change us he's already changed the inside guy because remember brother brown said you're born in the image of what comes what's inside of you when you take a body change you're going to change to what's on the inside all right so now that's what i should be talking about over here so we have to go through passover we have to go through unleavened bread and remember all those remember no leaven see now eleven remember is a type of sin but remember this is also as we come up to the feast of weeks you've got to bake with leaven to bake or let it rise as two loaves as christ and the bride everybody got that because christ had to come in human flesh okay now remember he wasn't born in sin but he came into this sinful world because he was 30 and yet looked 50. so it wasn't that he continued to stay a young boy again but remember his soul didn't need to be changed he was god almighty he just was trapped in a human body for one purpose and that's redemption one purpose because he could be melchizedek he could be the um me and joshua thomas this morning it could be melchizedek it could be the one that meant joshua that's okay but they were young looking stepped out of a body step right back into eternity jesus christ had to come into this world into satan's eden had to be born in this world to do one thing and that's to bear your sin to bear your sin but he was an eternal person inside i have to put my hope on that because when he went to calvary remember the holy ghost hadn't been given yet but he was the holy ghost what was inside of him was the holy ghost that's what brother brown said broke the blood cell so that the flesh man could die release the life for him to go talk to the people in the prison in hell come back up to paradise pick them up take them to a position and come right back up and pick that body up and when he picked that body up what did he do it turned back into that 18 year old form that i believe what god looked like before the foundation of the world he's a young guy standing out there in eternity not an old man how we gonna be born and changed in his image if he's young we're young amen brother brown proved that by going across the curtain of time and seeing the 90 year old woman he said and the angel lord i kind of you know the angel lord kind of was just i don't know if he's picking on him or not he said don't you remember that girl well no he didn't because she was 90 years old when he remembered her on this side but boy to see her on the other side and see he said oh my that's why he said right after that he said don't miss this whatever you do don't miss this the 90 year old was an 18 year old girl and he said she'll be that for an eternity but you know what there's a 90 year old body of that girl laying somewhere in the earth in a funeral arming in a in a grave that young person is going to be greater than that person now and that person that's greater is going to mold right back into that body and change it right back into a young woman again amen that's you know what we enjoy that the older ones some of the younger ones are still going what do they mean what they mean they have aches and pains and can't get out of bed except in shifts just just wait i hope you don't have to go through it i hope we're out of here before this all right so he got passover unleavened bread first fruits was the barley harvest remember the what was the first one to come to maturity and we told you what barley was when jesus resurrected remember barley is the um kind of a cheap cheaper um wheat wheat's more expensive because the bible tells us in revelations it's like three times more for wheat than it is for barley but we know what that is because jesus made himself lower than the angels he made himself lower than they they called him everything but jesus christ the son of the living god they called him the devil they called him a wine bible they called him a sinner because he hung around people but now remember they knew he was different they knew there was something different about that guy all right he was trying to save their soul and they wouldn't let him i'm talking about the religious world it's always it's always been fascinating how that when he met that man of gadara the maniac of gabriel you may call it whatever legions of demons was in that man legions and they called him the son of god they declared with their voice thou son of god why have you come here to torment us before our time and then when he turned and went across the ocean went across the sea went into the temple and they're calling him belzebub the religious people of the world that shouldn't have them 1 000 legions of demons to me they had more demons than legion did at least they had more strong ones to call the son of god a devil and satan call him the son of god so but that's what it is now god of this evil age same thing it's blinded the eyes of the people so now we've got the feast of pentecost which is your second harvest have i got that first harvest second harvest feast of weeks which is the wheat harvest where you had to make two loaves of bread with leaven so you had to add this back in because what did god do god didn't change peter on the day of pentecost in his flesh he changed him in his soul not exchange i'm saying that again god doesn't exchange your soul you are who you are who you are all right and that's what god wants to work on he wants to deal with he wants to deal with your soul he don't want to buy you a new one or get you a new one and put no he likes what he's got that's right all right so now that's the feast of pentecost so you got now look when did the day of pentecost happen it was on the what 50th day which is the eighth day which is the eighth day you say how seven sevens is 49 you keep your seven cycle it was one day extra which is the eighth day so the so the baptism of the holy ghost come on the eighth day you and i the baptism of holy ghost came on your what eighth day called you out of the what church age that you're in the seventh church age that you're in called you out of it we're not going to get the feast of tabernacles i don't think but that feast of pentecost changed them inside all right so now you've got your feast of first fruits which was barley jesus christ raised from the dead all right he said i'll be right back so he came back on the eighth day on the day of pentecost outside of the sevens that's why the jubilee year counting to you remember i read it trumpets and the feasts of the trumpets it's 49 years and then one more year which is not another year it's the one year of the next 49 year cycle which what makes this circle all right makes a circle all right we spoke about that long time ago all right so the feast of pentecost so that's the feast of weeks because of seven sevens so the 50th day the holy ghost came and then we've had a long period brother brown tells us a long period of dry summer which it's not it's not dry it may be dry to the world but it's not dry to the people that receive the baptism of the holy ghost because from this day right here until this day i'm talking about not 12 or 24 hour day i'm talking about the day of the lord the day the the seven church ages all right because there you have your feast of weeks you're seven church ages we've been through seven church ages where god has each each age has had a pentecost they had their own day of pentecost not one day though it spread out now to where every day is the day of pentecost all right every day is the day of first fruits unleavened bread passover different ones because there's people getting born again every day now on that day of pentecost it was 120 on that day and 3 000. right but then see that spread by spiritual multiplication that spread out through the church ages spread out through the church ages each one having a messenger to bring the message to that age everybody got that say amen and what is that message here we come to the trumpets that we were talking about a couple of sundays ago we come to the feast of trumpets what is trumpets trumpets is a noise or trumpets is a voice or trumpet is a sound and we read the different things about the feasts of the trumpets now let's go to leviticus 23 23 just to review if i don't get finished we'll finish winning tonight that'll be okay and the lord speaking to moses and speaking of the children of israel standing in the seventh month now remember we're in the set we're in the fall feast all right we're in the fall feast where they harvest corn and fruit that sound familiar okay speaking of the children of israel saying in the seventh month in the first day of the month shall you have a sabbath a memorial of blowing of trumpets on holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein but you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord now we go to first corinthians 14 verse 7 even things without life giving sound where the pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sound how shall it be known what is piped or heart how do you know that william branham was right how you know we're not supposed to be following fill in the blank how do you know that because that trumpet of others have given uncertain sound like i said before you be sitting in the congregation i have several times and i i am not critical of preachers because preachers can do you good but they said uncle do you also do you harm and they can also tell you things that are not right okay for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound and then that little something inside of you what is it it's that man in the control tower going wait a minute wait a minute let's put that in the bible let's put that in the prophet's message you got to put them both together because if that trumpet given uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to battle listen i almost giggled out loud he was talking about the four combat beasts he kept saying combat beasts combat beast and the thought came to me yeah lord you didn't call him the four picnic beast right you didn't call them before picnic beasts whether you know it's like an and a slug and no they're combat beasts they're lying they're ox the man in the eagle combat something to fight with yes who shall prepare himself to battle that's why i thought of the quote where brother brown said this is not a picnic this is the battle so i said lord you didn't send this picnic beast you sent us combat beasts and they will if we'll just if we'll just let that what as ezekiel says let that one come to the forefront right if you need the line if you need the opposite man and the eagles right here inside of you don't have to call to get it but thank god see that a prophet a trumpet told us that those four combat beasts were the baptism of the holy ghost you won't hear that from anybody else but now that i read it in the bible see now that you read it in the bible with an open book you see it all the way down through how the lion did his work the ox did his work and then brother branham goes and puts them in the church ages first three church ages the boldness of a line they stepped out peter said silver and gold have i none columba's age it was just the ox you know the labor it was just a whole 1500 years of dark ages they barely made it through that ox labor you know not very fast but pulls a lot of weight all right same way with you and i brother ryan said we need that every day all right then you've got what the intelligence of man now look not the intelligence of man but the intelligence in the statue of a perfect man that knowledge that the holy ghost gives you is holy ghost knowledge comes from the man anointing all right but now remember too we had a man anointing down here on earth because look in the time of luther and wesley and toward pentecost the the age of of people building stuff you know you went from a buggy to a car right you had all these different communication everything happened during the man intelligence part but god was given the intelligence from luther and wesley and pentecost and given it to us in the intelligence of god not the intelligence of man sure we use the intelligence of man you have to to go to school and do all the different things and but when it's contrary to the word of god you go back to god's intelligence you go back to god's knowledge all right so likewise ye accept ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for you shall speak into the air listen if this i'm going to say this if it's not an inspired word of god you're just speaking in the air you're just speaking into the air that's why jesus said he said my words will not return void but will accomplish what it said that's why i read that quote where brother brown said well you've done all you can do stand right there say god you said it and i'm gonna stand right here kind of like that guy that says lord if you don't save me you're gonna find a bag of dry bones right here in this in this spot because i'm not moving well see when we get that desperate then see god moves on the scene instead of us just saying you know half a minute prayer and going on but for shall who for ye shall speak into the air so it's got to have what this message this word of god has substance because remember when we get into this we ever get the tabernacles john 1 just absolutely nails it when he said the word was made flesh and that word dwelt is interpreted as tabernacle so he said that word was made flesh and tabernacled he made a booth just like he required them in israel to make a booth he made a booth to live in called jesus christ all right all right now let's go to first corinthians 15 51 because look that trumpet look where it happened it didn't happen over here in your new birth you were a baby don't pull the chart up but you were a baby you were in your springtime because you got four spring fish you got three fall fees but now remember from your new birth until that trumpet sounding is a journey it's a journey you go through we've all been through but there's going to be a time when this says behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye what at the last trump this is it there is no other trumpeter no other messenger to come no other porter listen folks if christ don't come on the scene like he said he would then what are we looking for that's what i was thinking you know everybody said well you know this is the time of for this is the time for jesus to come jesus come you know they push this thing off even denominations they in the catholic church they keep him on the cross okay jesus died for me two thousand years ago okay that's good right but you got to take that and put that life in here if you don't put that life in here then you're just going through motions right see that's why brother brown i believe the last trump for the trumpeter sound he gave brother branham two messages this messenger malachi 4 will do two things number one restore back the faith of the fathers take us back to that first day holy convocation and then something that's never been revealed in the seven days of feast only in the eighth day holy convocation was that revealed right and that's what come to me and you but you gotta have an eight day new birth first right if not you're just sitting there in a cycle of sevens you won't have a jubilee year no we're in we've already entered in our 50 our jubilee because that's what the day of pentecost was it was on the penta 50th day they received the holy ghost and on your 50th day you received the holy ghost not 24-hour day but in the day of the lord that's why i said i love when john says i was in the lord's day and it took a profit to tell us that that wasn't a 24-hour day that was the day that john was living in like he said oh he said arm of neville the day that arma neville lives in is the day that the revelation is when the armor devil's on the earth so what's ours we're the eighth day in spirit but it's re or so but it's required this is required reading or required revelation that we take this thing into the eighth day nobody else has had to do that seven sevens they just continued in that seven year cycle and the seven sevens is 49 and but somebody in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump you got to get into first trump the first part of the message then the trumpet shall sound to me that's the blast of those seven thunders that reveals you into the eight that takes this into the eighth day but you know what we've got to accept it up here first what have you heard all your life what have you heard all your life by and by i'm gonna die right death has reigned the bible says from adam until now that's right and it's still raining r-e-i-g rain not r-a-i-n all right rain did i spell that right yeah okay death has reigned in other words you and i know that when we're born into this world we come to acknowledge especially some of us that are a little bit dark i mean lighter on the top realize that we're heading toward the sundown of our life and if something doesn't happen sun's going to go down but now not on the inside guys see it's already entered into that eighth day that's why if we ever get to it if we don't get to it we'll get to it wednesday that that's why brother branham that great revelation they said brother brown you've run out of your types you've seven you've seven you've seven you're seven he said hold on got one more because remember literally you and i are gonna stay in this seven day or a week cycle month cycle whatever you wanna call it we're staying in a seven cycle now look we've already passed from death into life but i'm telling you physically even when we come back the millennium will still be a seven day rest right it will not be the eighth day that's why thank god for a prophet that he showed a scripture over here that was only for the millennium he showed a scripture over here that was only for the future home future home who in the world thought of a future home because you have people that don't even believe in the millennium you got people in the message that think we're already in the millennium take them to a zoo throw them in with the tigers and we'll find out whether in the millennium or not but we are waiting for that future home not the millennium the millennium's not to us it's to israel because of that last day right that's right they'll build and they'll inhabit the future home folks has already been built it was built by your desire you have your own little god's green acre when you got born again you got a part of the city literally not just figuratively cause nothing's gonna live in that city that didn't have the new birth while they were on earth i i just don't see that that's what brother brown said and then we read the we read the scripture that now says the lamb will be the light in the city well guess what if the lamb's delight you and i are going to be the light because it glows all through us because what she is him amen and the moment in the twinkling of an eye to last trump a lot of people heard that last trump but did they hear the trumpet that sounded that the dead shall be raised incorruptible no they have not because a lot of them are already still as we said brother mo brother all the different ones is passed on they're waiting on us now they heard the last trump right but they didn't hear the last trumpet right that trumpet is that seventh under virtue they thought it was see it's not seven virtues or seven men with different virtues it's what it's a revelation that you're being changed and then in the moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed i'll guarantee you you start seeing the dead walk that were dead before not dead asleep the ones that were asleep in christ they died in christ before listen we're all dead in christ right now that's why i said you we read that scripture wrong says the dead in christ there's nobody physically dead in christ that's right i said physically they died because of the curse but they died in christ when we put them in a watery grave and they came up and received the baptism of the holy ghost that's when they died so now i am already dead in christ paul says i die daily i'm working on a sermon brother louise the power of death we think death is this i'm going to die a lot of things that's connected with death has a lot of power to it if jesus hadn't died he couldn't have stood up and said all power and heaven and earth's been given unto me amen so that's why brother brown says why do we fear death we're already dead is wherever gonna be all right we'll get to this in a minute now day of atonement so that's the trumpet we have heard the noise that's going to wake up the saints brother brown said rapture in faith lies in these books and tapes we've just got to get a five-fold ministry to put it all together and that we don't put it together god puts it together you hear the part you need to have rapture in faith amen but i'm going to depend on that because i'm going to stand right here it doesn't matter if i get 60 65 70. some of y'all will be way older than that anyway but i'm going to depend on that that trump sounded that trump sounded yes i heard that voice and i asked god to forgive me of my sins and he didn't just birth me into the body of christ he gave me this message because that's the last trumpet yeah i'll clap too that was the last trumpet that you and i are going to hear like i said can you realize that listen we don't get a trumpet to israel they'll get a beautiful message from two prophets not to us we have this is it the last trumpet our feast of trumpets we are continually in it because to the to the bride i say the bride not just christianity to the bride these are all continual feasts every day we get up i remember that passover that man that died for me because i say lord jesus help me through this day well i'm talking to the passover lamb the guy that died for me and the unleavened bread and the first fruits that there's a resurrection every day in our life amen and then there's a pentecost and then there's a trumpet and then we look right here at this day of atonement now i love that day of atonement because it really tells us i believe the day of atonement told natural israel where they were because what they were atoning for they were they were they had to have a day that a priest took one sacrifice back behind the veil he had to make one for himself first he didn't go back there with beer on his breath amen he didn't go back there with adultery on his breath he had to be amen so he had to make her sacrifice for himself and for his family before he walked in listen i know we ministers you should never hold a minister up because i promise you we'll fall okay but we have to be careful every day of our life brother brown told us money women in popularity and you see how many those three have killed a ministry of somebody even so very recently of different ones so we have you know why because we're the ones that we got the blood god requires the first fruit god gives the revelation to the prophet the prophet preached 1100 sermons to me this is so simple why convoluted he gave us 1100 sermons then he took brother brown said i give you the big nuggets that's right and now i want you to take the little nut take the big nuggets what go into your study pound out the gold into little nuggets because mama eagle can't feed you a whole chicken amen remember we talked about that eagles don't eat milk drink milk they eat meat but mama eagle chews it up mama eagle sits in her study and she chews it up and then whatever your heart desires when you open up mama eagle put that little bit of meat that little bit of meat that you need to me it's so simple so simple that that's what that god's give us a fivefold ministry and we don't need a great big convention hall to have it in dan heard both trumpet they hadn't heard they might have heard of trump but they didn't hear the trumpet because the trumpet has to come from a fivefold ministry the trump came from brother branham this is what i believe the trump the message hey god said hey yeah hey here it is now you take and declare with your trumpet that's right watchman watchman you're in your tower what do you see and then you speak against him that's just what to me that's the way god give it to us and it's so simple and the lord spoken to moses saying on the day of atonement also on the tenth day of the seventh month now remember the first day was a blowing of trumpets get ready get ready something's coming you've got 10 days remember i read the commentary you've got 10 days to get yourself straightened out because on this day of atonement that priest is going in and he's going to do one sacrifice right then he's going to bring two goats in oh how perfect also on the tenth day of the seventh month there should be a day of atonement it shall be a holy convocation unto you and you shall afflict yours this is the first time that word comes up you shall afflict your souls way down deep inside listen unleavened bread that's cleaning up the outside that's getting all the trash out but now god says you need to dig down deep find out as brother tom falbus said if you've got the stuff afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire to the lord why because you're getting ready to go build you a house a little temporary tabernacle and that's where you're going to have to stay for a little while okay you shall afflict your soul and offer an offering made by fire unto the lord and you shall do no work in that same day for it is a day of atonement to make an atonement for you before the lord your god now the hebrew lexicon tells us just redoing what we did last week make an attempt to purge to cover cover over with pitch to pacify or propitiate to cover a tone for sin make atonement for cover over now look see their problem in the old testament was that's all it done the blood of bulls and goats god said okay for one year i'm not gonna remember that anymore because we're gonna do two things we're gonna kill one goat we're gonna take the blood of that goat sprinkle it on the scapegoat and we're going to send it out far as the east is from the west i'm not going to remember that sin anymore but what happened is in the old testament i know this is elementary but we're going to back up a little bit to help everybody excuse me but that scapegoat was the second one and took the scent away but now next year in october or september october is what it's half and half everybody got that remember it's not exactly it's the moon phase but anyway in the fall in october the priest had to redo it all over again because the sin had piled up underneath and god was going to say hey i'm going to start killing these people because i can't stand it their sin has went all the way to heaven so the high priest makes an atonement for himself he gets himself ready with the message and then he takes that blood of the bull he takes it in and all the sin of the people are on him that's why jesus christ was our high priest he took our sin into the holy of holies and didn't just cover it remember in hebrews or romans paul picks that up and he says now every year there was a sacrifice made for sins that were committed and he said if it hadn't been for jesus christ he said then we still would be continued doing that and they were still doing it and they still do it now because to them christ hasn't come right but now remember they don't have the items to do it with now that's what they're trying to get the temple mount people and all the different ones they know they sin they know they have problems with the lord but all they got to do is receive jesus christ not try to make a sacrifice that's why i see their eyes are literally blinded just like that right there so that me and you can come in but buddy when that thing comes off talk about a day of atonement talk about a day when 144 000 are going to mourn that they have already killed the messiah it's been 2 000 years but just like joseph said joseph said don't worry remember when he revealed himself to benjamin and all that he revealed himself to them what's the first thing they said oh man we deceived him and we killed him well supposedly killed him way back when we put him in a pit and we did away with our brother said oh lord he's so powerful now all he's got to do is say die and we die right he was the right hand of pharaoh whatever he whatever joseph said that's what happened but what did joseph tell him he said i hadn't forgot you he said i've known you for the whole time you've been gone he said i've been watching after you he said don't you remember i told you to come over here for my protection go to israel uh come back into the homeland for some protection and he said it was done to preserve life in other words it was done for him to get a gentile bride took her to the palace and left her there and came back to reveal himself to the little benjamin group the 144 000 that's why that day of atonement is so important where they say where did you get those scars he says in the house of my friends in zechariah what a gracious god but every year they're going through the ritual motions of it every year and don't even realize but when they do realize you know what them old orthodox jews are going to do every one of them i believe are going to turn back to these feast days they're going to turn back to leviticus and they're going to read them feast days and then two prophets are going to preach them jesus christ and they're going to go boom the trumpet will sound right for them that feast of trumpets will be the trumpet that sounds through two witnesses that bring them to their day of atonement and then what's going to happen they're going to receive the baptism of the holy ghost in their booth and be taken in a rapture but now see remember they in titan have to bring that booth back to the millennium you and i remember there for a honeymoon they've got work to do according to daniel 70 weeks according to the book of ezekiel they got to build a temple and i want to read you something here in just a minute that i found out if we ever get to it but we know one thing's for sure we know what the two let's not we won't read that commentary brother joe just go ahead and go to the feast of tabernacles all right let's go leviticus 25 8. because we know on the feast of atonement they have two goats i told you one was a scapegoat and the other one was a goat they killed sprinkled the blood they sprinkled the blood on the scapegoat and a man took that scapegoat so far away that he never would come back same way with god and your sin take it so far away because one goat remember both goats are jesus christ one they literally killed him and put him on a cross right but then when he came back on the day of pentecost he didn't just cover their blood with cover them with blood he eradicated their sin by the blood the atonement the atonement was made the atonement was made don't have to make another one anymore don't have to go year by year as paul tells there in romans or or somewhere in there now look leviticus 25 eight now number seven here we go with the sevens again i want to make that point but watch seven times seven years the space of the seventh sabbath now this has to do with the trumpets i think i misput this i put this in the wrong place but we're gonna read it anyway then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month and the day of atonement shall you make no it covers both in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound so on the day of atonement you could go free on your day of atonement you went free oh no i got this sent you hadn't put it on that scapegoat yet you need to put that thing on that scapegoat and let god almighty carry that thing and put it in let him drop off in the sea of god's forgetfulness never never to be remembered again all right let's go feast the tabernacles we got just about 15 minutes maybe here so pull the chart back up just one more time no joke please i kind of like that how that went down it came up pretty neat so we're right here it's called sukkot or booths or the feast have been gathering because it is the last harvest you gather in the harvest this is the last harvest the harvest of corn and fruit hmm i am the vine you are the branches what bears the fruit the branches amen what a great type all the way through so here we are on the feast of tabernacles the last feast so we've went through it by the baptism of the holy ghost to me our day of atonement is is when we realize we need these these virtues there's a lot of people who don't realize they need them but the bible says and brother brown says they're required and once you realize they're acquired oh what a day of atonement you realize that that blood didn't stop down here when you received the holy ghost no you come back into the court outer court inner court holy of holies what does the holy of holies do take away your sin sister shepherd what does it do balls of trash out amen seals it in with what the holy spirit which is the type of the day of atonement that you realize something died for you and not that just jesus died for your sins that's okay you know that's wonderful but what about now jesus christ died from my sin yet i still curse jesus christ took away my sin yet i still you know put put it in there whatever it is put it inside there you can't do that and then going up the statue of a perfect man yeah i had a well i didn't have much of a temper but i was temperamental ain't much difference bob that's just not don't laugh like that but he's still working on me make me what you know what that's that day of atonement i have to realize again that that goat is gone whatever goat you had god sprinkled it with his blood and sent it out now what we're doing we're going let it go let it go that's why that yeah sure the 144 thousand in zechariah they're gonna mourn but after that morning m-o-u-r-n-i-n-g mourn after that what a joyous time because they're gonna realize god has come back to get them in their tabernacle leviticus 23 verse 34. speaking the children of israel saying on the 15th day of the seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the lord on the first day shall be a holy convocation so on the first day you got a holy convocation because what you got to do you can't work but you got you got to have what bring your bowels you got to cut your trees you know you're not doing any physical servile work but you are bringing it you got to build your house listen you have something to do with that amen you have something to do with that statue of a perfect man that's something that's the things you sacrifice to the lord all right on the first day shall be a holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein seven days shall you offer an offering made by fire and to the lord on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you and you shall offer an offering made by firing to the lord is a solemn assembly and you shall do no servile work therein then if you'll let's skip 37 go down to 39. also in the 15th day of the 7th month this is telling you what you got to do now on that 15th day of the 7th month in other words the 15th day of october somewhere in there i think it falls this year october the 2nd but remember that's our calendar versus theirs because see they keep up with it you go pull it up on a computer just put in feast days it'll tell you for the next 20 years what day the feast day is on literally our day you know our days when you have gathered in the fruit of the land so see what they have they have to harvest the fruit everybody say amen harvest the fruit fruits of the spirit love joy peace long suffering amen gather in the fruit gather it in it's why it's called the feast of in gathering you know what god's doing folks he's gathering in all that paul irenaeus martin columba luther wesley and brother branham talk you and i are getting the whole uh in a southern language shebang we're getting the whole meal deal we're getting the seven course we're not leaving one out because listen to change this body we need every bit of it we need every bit of it on the 15th day of the seventh month when you have gathered in the fruit of the land you shall keep and feast unto the lord seven days on the first day shall be a sabbath and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath and you shall take you on the first day the bowels of goodly trees branches of palm trees and the bowels of thick trees and willows of the brook look nothing man-made all-natural all right and you shall rejoice before the lord your god seven days and you shall keep it as a feast you shall keep it a feast unto the lord seven days in the year it shall be a statute forever in your generations you shall celebrate it in the seventh month you shall dwell in booth seven days so seven church ages you've dwelt god has dwelt in booths for seven church ages but there comes an eighth day on the outside of that and that's the benefit you and i get for listening to the last trumpet that your generation may know that i made the children of israel to dwell in boost when i brought them out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god let's go to deuteronomy 16 verse 13. thou shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days after that yeah here it is after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine now remember what makes wine grapes fruit fruit does not grapefruit fruit all right and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast thou and thy son and thy everybody nobody's excluded look manservant maidservant levi bring in the strangers the fatherless the widow that are within thy gates seven days shall thou keep a solemn feast unto the lord thy god in the place which the lord shall choose now where did where did he choose to place himself brother brown said in the heart of man not in a building not a tabernacle out there in the heart of man and the lord thy god shall bless thee in all thine and in all the works of thine hands therefore thou shalt surely rejoice surely rejoice let's let brother branham now remember this is the future home and he's telling us now you got your sevens you got you're an eighth day so look say well now brother branham you've done run out you got your seven aaron you're gonna have a problem they're already asleep now so are you all right let's take the last feast which is the feast of tabernacles now notice here in the 36th verse seven days shall you offer an offer made by firing to the lord he's reading the bible on the eighth day on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation there is another holy time coming amen holy convocation unto you now not to the nation to you and you shall offer an offer made by fire unto the lord is a solemn assembly and you shall do no servile work therein brother brown now says now we've got an eighth day now there's only seven days but here we speak of the eighth day holy convocation convocation notice do no work in it the eighth day or what back to the first day why it speaks of eternity and she rolls around without a stopping place amen do you see it congregation says amen because remember you're only staying there seven days you're only required to stay in this for seven church ages because after the church age is over there's some kind of change going to happen you're not in a booth made of sticks and bowels and no it's your booth it's your eternal body notice it was also upon this eighth day last day feast day of the tabernacle notice after that after the last feast day after the last church age after the last complete seven days upon earth look after the millennium so the millennium is still under the seventh day and you say well you're we're going to be eternal so as israel somebody is not going to be eternal now that's a whole nother game for us to talk about because somebody's got to live a thousand years but i want you to watch when i read another scripture here we'll look at something and see it all right after the last complete seven days upon the earth after the millennium that this holy convocation comes because listen everything doesn't go in the eighth day until the future home comes down to the earth then everything's eternal because remember in the millennium you still got fifth seal jew you've got um you've got the um foolish virgin that's dead somewhere waiting you've got the dead center dead all that you've still got there so that can't be an eight got to stay in a seven everybody got that you got to stay in that 7 7 7 7 7 7 all right but now you and i are going to be in the eighth day body spirit and soul during the millennium the the two witnesses and the 144 thousand obviously are going to be because they take a rapture they're going to come back in eternal bodies now watch what he's talking about but in the new earth he has already went and prepared the place it's built we have nothing to do with the building of it he's talking about the eighth day remember the holy convocation don't do anything amen eternal lord just love that word a holy convocation the eighth day which is only seven days then on the eighth day which comes back to the first day again comes right back to the first day the eighth day of the holy convo convocation notice seven days only has to do with the old creation world time seven days that's the millennium the rest day as god labored six days rested the seventh the church labored six days and rest the seventh but you're still in the time element i ain't speaking of the eternal he's talking about the millennium but you see there's no such a thing as eight days you go back to the first day again see the first day the sabbath speaks of the old law which was to pass away the keeping of a sabbath which passed away or i've said changed to another it didn't pass away it's about getting a new heaven and new earth because it doesn't annihilate them it just changes them all right that's the same way with me and you he didn't annihilate your body and put you in a new one when you got the new birth no he just changed the one you got right and he's going to literally change it in this church age it just changed from the old law of keeping a certain day of the week now let's go to number two so old man and old woman don't be discouraged if you are a representation up here he's talking about the blackboard he drew the representation in this attribute of god this god if you have it if you're represented here you cannot you're in the eternal and if you've crossed from that seventh day into the eighth you got into the eternal by the baptism of the holy ghost so that's what i said we're already in our future home this is our future home amen that's right this is it remember john saw it as a bride what a bride coming down out of heaven as a bride adorned for a husband he saw a city and saw a bride now if you're just trusting upon a sensation or jumping up and down or i do this i keep my seventh day i don't eat meat and things like that that's going to perish anyhow but this is the eternal this is the eternal the feast after the feast of tabernacles the feast of tabernacles was the last feast the seventh feast we are worshiping now under the feast of tabernacles the seventh church age which is exactly right but if you're born again you've already entered into the eighth day spiritually in the millennium will be under the feast of tabernacles again because remember he goes on later and quotes a scripture that the bible says they'll build houses and they'll inhabit you and i are not going to do that we're in the building we need to be in and our future home's coming a thousand years later but then after the seventh day we have a holy convocation go back into the eternal we come from eternity folks and we're going right back to eternity we just picked up a flesh body for redemption to bring it right back up to where it's supposed to be by the eternal one that came and redeemed us and taken us back letting us recognize that we're a part of this we're a part of this let us recognize we are a part of this i'm gonna read this one do you know that that in the book of acts and philip read zechariah put this up but in the book of acts in the book of philip philippians when were when were males circumcised ah on the eighth day when were you circumcised on the eighth day natural types of spiritual acts seven verses he gave him the covenant of circumcision so abraham begot isaac isaac circumcised and circumcised him on the eighth day in philippians paul says circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribal benjamin he was literally physically circumcised on the eighth day but when he got the new birth it made him spiritually circumcised on what on his eighth day all right let's go to zechariah real quick i want you to get this because this will explain a little bit go back brother joseph there you go now this is zechariah 14 and it shall come to pass now look this is the millennium because watch what happened and it shall come to pass that every one that is left of all the nations which came against jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king the lord capital of hosts and to keep the feast of tabernacles it's going to be required in the millennium that they keep the feast of tabernacles because watch and it shall be that whoso will not come of all the families of the earth unto jerusalem to worship the king the lord of hosts even upon them shall be no reign brother brown talks about a heathen being raised up in the millennium and thus preaching the gospel to them now that's for a whole new thought but right here in the bible watch and if the family of egypt go not up and come not they'll have no rain there shall be the plague so plague remember millennium is in time to everybody but us in 144 000. right right right right it's not going to bother us but if they're going to build houses and inhabit there's got to be a world going on out there somewhere there shall be the plague where the lord will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles this shall be the punishment of egypt what talk about the world and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles remember the bible says he will rule with a rod of iron in the millennium something to think about it'll be a joyous time for us folks it'll be a joyous time for 144 thousand but there's going to be a world out there that things may be going on i'm telling you it's not eternal it's not an eternal place but it's a millennium that me and you get to rest and what if we have to walk out one day and go wind quit that aren't we back to the atom condition again see we're not gonna need that in the future home we're not gonna need adjustments in the future home amen it's perfect already done the prophet said come on musician the brother brown said it's already done it's set we're not going to need to move an avenue or make our pond bigger but now in the millennium food for thought the world is still in time and this in zechariah you'll continue reading zechariah 14 in different places that tells about israel being in the millennium the heathen in the millennium but just remember this is the last harvest before everything that goes dead the world will be in their winter time when we leave this place everything will be dead i'm talking about physically when we leave this earth there's only going to be 144 000 and two witnesses that have any kind of life in them let's stand to our feet everything else will die everything will be dead because we know that that this battle that we're talking about there in the in the tribulation and all is going to be a physical battle an atomic battle it's not going to be god's battle is the battle of gog and magog before the future home but before but before the millennium begins there's a battle the battle of armageddon that's been told in the bible is going to happen but you know what you and i listen if you're already in your eighth day right now you do not what i said the great revelation the great revelation is that god sent us a prophet to tell us you don't have to go through that amen you have entered into your oh brother branham seven seven seven seven is not eternity hold on a minute he says it's been in your bible the whole time uh god give us a eighth day holy convocation outside of the seven that we can feast under that and just rest and just rest god bless you we love you with the love of the lord let's sing a song before we before we go [Music] [Applause] [Music] others do but to wait in prayer think of that for an answer from you everybody's waiting on an answer lay that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk you cannot faith teach me lord [Music] peace [Music] the name of the lord we got a name [Music] upon the lord shall renew your dismiss come back at one o'clock they shall mount up with wings as an eagle [Music]
