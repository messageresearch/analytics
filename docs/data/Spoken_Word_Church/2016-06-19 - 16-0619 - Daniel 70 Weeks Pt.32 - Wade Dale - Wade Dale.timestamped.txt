[0:21] from you today okay what that game has
[0:28] that recessive gene pointing I want more
[0:31] I quit school go to reset yeah alright
[0:37] now we're gonna finish up today and what
[0:40] we're going to do is is go over a few
[0:41] points and then you can go back review
[0:44] Bob is still working on the chart I hope
[0:49] it don't think as long as it took me to
[0:51] bring this chart he's he's finding
[0:56] tunity
[0:57] it's fine to me alright fine tuned
[1:00] charts up and defined terms the chart
[1:02] he's not putting the media file and then
[1:04] he's gonna send it to all your email
[1:06] addresses so you can pull it up and look
[1:09] at it yourself at home and you can you
[1:12] know Rebecca did you get anything more
[1:15] about them the Bob's gonna he's fine
[1:25] tuned and he's gonna stay tuned
[1:26] everybody mail address
[1:35] see we pulled it off of the computer the
[1:38] other day and it's so small you have to
[1:42] you have to expand it in sections and
[1:44] read it and then then downsize that go
[1:47] over here expand it read it because if
[1:50] you put the whole chart on this right
[1:52] here it'd be limp word would be ten
[1:54] times smaller than that you know you're
[1:55] at the Pennsy in someone that's why
[1:58] we're back is gonna try to she's got one
[2:01] of those machines that work that does
[2:02] not yep that does the that does stuff
[2:07] like that you know there's a way to do
[2:09] it that you see back consider this big
[2:10] you know and then he'll uh trying the
[2:13] label brother you know because whatever
[2:17] Jake is right hanging on the wall so
[2:20] right right now I want to get out one
[2:23] thing there's been brother Rhino minutes
[2:29] in this whole entire ministry he drew
[2:33] three charts that are very prominent and
[2:37] the message all right number ones
[2:40] interchanges
[2:41] all right you go to her textbook open it
[2:42] to the front it shows the seven churches
[2:45] and the messenger beach age when he's
[2:51] begun when it ended and then remembered
[2:53] though the Holy Ghost came back
[2:55] afterwards
[2:56] and drew the chart on the back wall
[2:57] showing that the chart was correct so it
[3:01] never has to be filled with or moved or
[3:04] changed because the doctrine of William
[3:06] Bratton right so then the second chart
[3:10] didn't add is the one behind your back
[3:12] over there and this one which is the
[3:14] stack of a bourbon man
[3:16] and their habit change this one ever
[3:18] change the doctrine now many people have
[3:20] changed his doctrine for us okay so we
[3:23] didn't really speak much of the chart
[3:26] except using it but I'm going to read
[3:28] you some quotes here that brother Graham
[3:31] said about the chart cuz he drew this
[3:33] chart and see man has put the Holy
[3:35] Spirit here and here and you can't get
[3:38] it to you can appear and this is this
[3:39] and this is that but brethren I would
[3:42] never say that I was wrong and I had to
[3:44] change the chart
[3:44] I believe when the man drew a chart that
[3:47] means that is a perpetual almost like
[3:51] the Bible the Bible was written they
[3:54] found the scroll
[3:56] they just they didn't interpret what he
[3:58] said they just translated off of that
[4:01] page right onto your Bible okay
[4:04] so there was no interpretation between
[4:06] that now once he got on the page man has
[4:08] had many interpretations today man is
[4:11] gonna open this Bible in about 3,000
[4:13] different denominations and preach the
[4:16] same preached three thousand different
[4:19] messages out same book same way was a
[4:22] message so I believe brother round then
[4:24] he threw the chart for the day and
[4:28] seventy weeks and for those of you that
[4:32] are listening in that are watching it
[4:34] now watch I don't know if it's you or so
[4:37] made in other parts of the country but
[4:39] they watched a bunch up to a point must
[4:42] have got bored and didn't that's gift
[4:44] about five and now they start to watch
[4:46] them all over again you know back over
[4:48] again so but on you that missed it this
[4:54] chart was drawn by Rebecca Branham
[4:59] you'll remember brother battle makes a
[5:02] comment about it in the seventy weeks of
[5:04] Daniel I don't know
[5:06] not be said that you know he said Becky
[5:10] this looks like a woman but it'll do for
[5:11] now so and then brother George Smith
[5:14] verified that this is what Rebecca group
[5:16] and come off of a memo graph piece of
[5:19] paper the she transferred it to because
[5:22] look at this type that's that old
[5:24] typewriter back in the 60s okay
[5:27] you know typing and she drew it out just
[5:30] like brother I'm good right here so I
[5:33] want to go to the 70th week Nathaniel
[5:35] Coe this is where he started using the
[5:37] chart in the 70th week of Daniel 1961
[5:41] they'll be able to sit open up riding
[5:43] spray it spray alright open up our eyes
[5:50] and ears of understanding today and as I
[5:52] endeavoured to bring forth this great
[5:53] question and clear it into people's mind
[5:56] well about that clear it into people's
[5:59] money
[6:00] Louise you're looking you're looking
[6:03] fresh I feel fresh you okay alright no
[6:10] if you don't bring you that unfresh
[6:11] missing yeah alright thanks for all the
[6:15] prayers
[6:17] okay now I'm gonna talk about you
[6:19] looking fresh good things you know I
[6:20] don't like you but I miss entrusting why
[6:23] not say hi so let me go back just for
[6:29] say brother Graham big three charge he
[6:33] do the church ages and the angel
[6:34] verified he drew the Statue of a perfect
[6:37] man never had a change of the man
[6:39] history has many doctrines of the statue
[6:43] of a perfect man
[6:43] right but now brother ground never
[6:46] change chart so now we're coming to the
[6:48] nineteen seventy weeks which is the
[6:49] third chart that he drew this chart
[6:52] actual piece of paper they're not this
[6:53] actual piece of paper but what's on it
[6:55] was memo graph through the years from
[6:59] what sister Rebecca brown
[7:00] copied off the chalkboard or the
[7:03] blackboard remember they didn't have
[7:05] these in chalkboard you deal with chalk
[7:09] and to draw it out so Becky drew this
[7:12] the chart only on the blackboard after
[7:17] Brad on Tabernacle the night that he
[7:19] preached this message the 70th week of
[7:21] Daniel that was verified by brother
[7:24] George Smith okay Rebecca this is what
[7:26] she given it says here chart of Daniel
[7:30] seventy weeks as drawn by brother
[7:31] William Brown so this is the chart we've
[7:34] been using the brother round ever in his
[7:37] life changed this one either he brought
[7:40] three charts now that's I'm looking for
[7:42] it but I can't find it does anybody have
[7:45] the ones that I gave out that he drew on
[7:48] a napkin at a restaurant several days
[7:52] afterwards and it's the exact same chart
[7:56] and brother Branham signed it
[7:59] I guess now this was given to us by
[8:02] brother Keith Brown said his his dad
[8:04] brother Homer Brown got this wrong
[8:08] brother
[8:08] and it says he's wrong my brother
[8:12] William Brown for a brother that was out
[8:14] a restaurant with brother on them in
[8:15] 1961 right it's same identical charge so
[8:22] brother had never changed and never said
[8:27] because listen if you draw something
[8:30] down and visualize what if brother round
[8:32] would have preached the seven sages and
[8:34] then when the seals open God said no
[8:37] there's eight brother Brown what the had
[8:40] go went back and said look do away with
[8:42] this chart are add this to it because
[8:44] they've been added revelation I don't
[8:47] believe that's true in any of these
[8:48] charts because it's that's that's the
[8:50] law thank you a perfect man seven church
[8:54] ages and the Daniel seventy weeks chart
[8:56] but I'm going to read you some quotes
[8:57] about what he says about your chart so
[8:59] it's this is the mouth of two or three
[9:02] witnesses two witnesses program drew the
[9:04] same turning in later in a restaurant
[9:07] and they copied it off on a sheet of
[9:10] paper they to use somebody say it was a
[9:12] napkin but that's okay
[9:14] number may know what example loneliness
[9:17] the same as this one if it was never
[9:20] without a problem but it's the same
[9:23] thank chart
[9:24] alright drawn by William Brown this is
[9:27] where program druid itself so he drew it
[9:29] right out of memory back off with when
[9:31] he had on a blackboard which was this
[9:33] one that sister Rebecca drew while he
[9:36] was preaching this sermon right here all
[9:38] right so who's for this is the Treaty of
[9:41] this year I need some company to that
[9:42] but we're out of coffee I've got copies
[9:45] of the others but it don't have copies
[9:48] of that one so I need to make some
[9:49] copies of that so now brother Brown
[9:51] tells for the 70th week of Daniel he's
[9:53] praying to the Lord opened up our ears
[9:57] of understanding today as I endeavor to
[9:59] bring forth this great question and
[10:00] clear it into people's minds he doesn't
[10:05] he sound confused no he'll tell me now I
[10:08] have it written out here Lord upon paper
[10:11] and also drawn upon this blackboard this
[10:14] chart but totally insufficient to
[10:18] explain now we call on you the great
[10:20] master who wrote the word who inspired
[10:22] it who gave it to the prophet Daniel and
[10:25] we pray that you'll send the inspiration
[10:27] this morning in these last days that he
[10:29] said the book would be closed until this
[10:31] time that you will open our
[10:34] understanding and there'd be a soft
[10:35] bedded faith and a heart that will let
[10:37] the word take hold and life and bring
[10:39] forth the trees of righteousness in our
[10:41] life that it's intended to do okay he
[10:44] says they man these starts the sermon
[10:47] all right now watch he's coming up to
[10:51] its tournament oh what a lesson I said
[10:56] to my wife the other day I wonder if the
[10:57] people are really getting it now I want
[10:58] you to get it don't sound like he's a
[11:01] little foggy with this does it I want
[11:04] you to get it if you have to stay here
[11:06] all day long just stay and now we won't
[11:11] forget it see we want to know that it's
[11:14] true and if you can just only see it and
[11:18] I'll ask maybe and then after
[11:20] I'm gonna leave the chart hanging here
[11:22] and you can draw it out afterwards
[11:24] coming here this afternoon whenever you
[11:26] want to and draw out the chart and so
[11:27] forth
[11:28] it'll help you to understand that sound
[11:33] like something I can for you to do
[11:34] that's the reason I put it there so that
[11:38] you would understand it okay so we went
[11:41] back to the chart and he reviews back
[11:43] over and we went through all the books
[11:44] last Sunday now in it about they've been
[11:49] one week left after the rapture now if
[11:52] we read in the Bible
[11:53] they've got 57 same message that there
[11:56] are 70 weeks determined upon the people
[11:58] and that has nothing to do with the
[11:59] church seventy weeks has nothing to do
[12:01] with Church church age especially
[12:03] looking right here at the gap if you
[12:08] notice here on the chart I've got the
[12:10] church ages in between those seventy
[12:13] weeks not sixty nine and a half huh okay
[12:21] some brother down from Georgia daughter
[12:23] fours overhead we went to the Turk
[12:25] agency but Sunbrella through this chart
[12:26] but remember the Holy Spirit through the
[12:28] chart on the back of the wall all right
[12:30] so brother biden confirmed god confirmed
[12:32] the devils correct
[12:34] all right now he's explaining through a
[12:37] paragraph 99 now remember he was cut off
[12:40] on the sides you cease to deal with them
[12:42] and they did not go any further than
[12:44] they were scattered by the roman empire
[12:45] that was in AD 70 all right I destroyed
[12:48] the temple then if you notice on my
[12:50] chart here we'd refer back to the chart
[12:52] I want you to get this now don't you
[12:54] notice where I got the cross the hold on
[12:58] this is an explanation that people don't
[13:01] get they're saying that that the when
[13:04] Jesus died here at Calvary where this
[13:06] cross is on the chart that that was
[13:09] their thing there's only three and a
[13:10] half years left but the Bible says after
[13:14] 62 weeks shall Messiah be cut off notice
[13:18] where I got the cross that's where they
[13:20] rejected but the time extended a little
[13:23] further from that thirty forty fourth
[13:25] you're doing right here
[13:26] or left over and that's where what Titus
[13:29] destroyed the Jerusalem in AD 70 all
[13:31] right
[13:32] 40 years later but what a t-33 or he'd
[13:38] be 37 years later he died maybe 30 40
[13:43] years later
[13:44] tie this the Roman general destroyed
[13:46] everyone scatter the people to all the
[13:47] world
[13:48] see Titus 40 years later oh my god that
[13:52] see I ain't referring back to this chart
[13:54] all right no yes explaining the 80 30
[14:02] 1933 difference well if you'll look even
[14:08] look Schofield Schofield uses pusher
[14:12] which puts Jesus at 80 30 but if you
[14:15] look at the cuff you guys go fill the
[14:17] Bible if you look at the top he even
[14:19] says a t-33 so there's a discrepancy
[14:23] when Jesus was born but we know that
[14:26] Jesus was born before BC making him 33
[14:31] years old in 1830 the times going down
[14:38] that's correct
[14:40] BC 4 3 2 1 not a 0 go back to 1 and that
[14:45] makes 33 brotherbrother that he was 33
[14:47] years old
[14:48] and then remember all the 1830s
[14:50] sometimes brother Brown will say a t-33
[14:52] slip of the tongue he might be hiding it
[14:55] from somebody I don't know but you can't
[14:57] make that number fit but you can make a
[15:00] t30 fit every time if I got that every
[15:03] time you can make a t30 fit but you
[15:05] can't make a t-33 fit now he's thinking
[15:08] 1933 is when he got the vision Jesus was
[15:11] 30 30 he said well why did he say that
[15:15] if he was so perfect he was still a man
[15:17] and God listen Jesus said to eat my
[15:20] flesh and drink my blood and walked off
[15:24] now he explained that is we in a South
[15:27] he didn't explain it he explained
[15:30] earlier well sure brother branham was a
[15:35] human man and that Holy Spirit had to go
[15:38] through that filter to speak so when
[15:43] he's in a t-33 he's thinking Jesus being
[15:45] 33 he's thinking 1933 because remember
[15:48] he gets over that he says from 33 to 77
[15:51] that's when those visions came in 1933
[15:54] so I'm telling you you've got to go back
[15:57] to the facts back is 80 30 is where
[16:00] everything fits the closest 33 it's off
[16:04] by years okay and even right here look
[16:08] brother ramble on his chart row 80 30 so
[16:13] if Jesus was born for PC but Bob's got
[16:17] it on his chart he even puts the
[16:19] numeration out because you can't have a
[16:21] zero year if he was born in 4bc
[16:23] they they know he was born between 4 & 6
[16:25] BC because Herod died somewhere in there
[16:27] yeah right parrot gave the decree to
[16:31] kill all the children that were 2 years
[16:32] old and either so right in there for BC
[16:36] somewhere and that's where Jesus was
[16:37] born
[16:38] okay then in 80 30 he was crucified
[16:42] Jesus rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday
[16:45] there's a quote in here I'm not gonna
[16:46] read it for them I'm reading about the
[16:48] church but call the nineteen seventy
[16:50] weeks Jesus realism threw them on white
[16:52] donkey they pull the second 8030 and
[16:56] with crucified several days later need a
[16:58] ride and Duncan lifts three more you
[17:00] know that was when they settled down to
[17:02] the king in one week are less than a
[17:04] week later he was dead at that Friday if
[17:06] you're gonna pass over right and that's
[17:09] another thing that this police have
[17:10] brought me some things that we did in
[17:11] 2009 we did a lot of this with the
[17:15] charge and with the Jewish time and the
[17:18] calendars remember one thing because see
[17:22] if you say well Friday they had to get
[17:26] him off the cross before 6 o'clock
[17:29] Passover started 6 o'clock the day
[17:31] before
[17:32] yes the upper room remember they went to
[17:35] the upper room and then he was killed
[17:37] the Passover start because they were
[17:39] going for the Passover meal the Passover
[17:41] meal to us was on Thursday but their
[17:46] Friday starts at 6 o'clock on Thursday
[17:49] the evening in the morning of the first
[17:52] day you know all Jewish people start a
[17:54] new day at 6 o'clock 6 p.m.
[17:57] ok when we come to see 2 o'clock this
[17:59] afternoon till I sit still society till
[18:02] midnight thanks to the Jews at 6 o'clock
[18:06] that's there well they had their Sabbath
[18:08] yesterday but that is our if we were
[18:12] Sabbatarians we would hold our Sabbath
[18:15] at 6 o'clock this afternoon we wouldn't
[18:17] do anything until 6 o'clock
[18:20] might be afternoon see so you have to
[18:22] because of that coming up you've thought
[18:24] about that though Jesus had a Passover
[18:26] meal but it was on Thursday he had two
[18:28] Passover meal on Friday evening he
[18:30] either had been killed on Saturday hey I
[18:33] found that yeah absolutely so it's six
[18:36] o'clock on Thursday details at the
[18:37] sample of look we got the Passover meal
[18:39] coming at 6 o'clock he eats the Passover
[18:41] dinner says this is my flesh this is my
[18:43] blood which I've given to you he goes
[18:45] through the evening of the Garden of
[18:47] Eden comes down to the next day he's at
[18:49] pilots hall they crucified between 3 and
[18:52] 6 o'clock in the afternoon
[18:53] remember I'm sitting on the cross they
[18:55] had to get him down before 6 o'clock
[18:56] because that was a high Sabbath coming
[18:58] up a hot abbath coming up yeah which was
[19:02] the leaven bread started on next day
[19:05] they had to get him off the cross so
[19:06] they'd have to leave him on cross for a
[19:08] whole day and in that humidity it had
[19:10] been horrible but they took him down
[19:13] before 6 o'clock very simple very simple
[19:16] but you got to pay attention we think
[19:19] going in our 24 hour day you got to
[19:21] thinking over there for when I say we're
[19:23] dying of seven new weeks you don't think
[19:24] in a Jewish time period
[19:27] Jewish time Jewish months Jewish years
[19:29] do it calendars everything got to be
[19:32] doing listen they don't care what what
[19:35] day we have over here they go by their
[19:38] day that's never affected the Jews since
[19:41] the beginning of time they melted well
[19:43] with the Gentiles I think will change
[19:44] you make the do come change
[19:47] don't wait juvenile change in God
[19:49] changing right I mean really starts from
[19:54] juniper so anyways I just want to say it
[19:59] the Bible / though he was killed in 1830
[20:04] the boss says after 62 weeks the Messiah
[20:07] was cut off so we prove that there was
[20:09] right here seven weeks and sixty-two
[20:11] weeks after 62 weeks
[20:14] the reason brother Brown a marked April
[20:16] the 2nd that's when the sixty-two weeks
[20:19] stop so after 62 weeks Messiah was cut
[20:23] off why would he say that April the 2nd
[20:26] 1830 he was marking the time just like
[20:29] we're marking towns now the brother
[20:31] Randall was looking in that whatever
[20:33] encyclopedia and all that he was looking
[20:34] in he marked that time period after 62
[20:37] weeks my silos cut off now look and of
[20:42] course you know that's what the preacher
[20:43] in the message did Oh after 62 weeks so
[20:45] it was three and a half years
[20:48] listen I'm gonna go to Walmart after I
[20:52] leave Church I spring quick but I'm
[20:56] going upstairs after we finish here when
[20:59] this Bible study is finished we're going
[21:01] upstairs how long it's gonna take it's
[21:03] two minutes but it's accurate it's
[21:07] accurate after 62 weeks of Messiah be
[21:09] cut off and that's exactly what right
[21:11] here all right there on my chart is to
[21:13] know up now ministry from Luke them to
[21:15] land of Pentecost in little bitty
[21:17] minority that's reasons a lot homo still
[21:19] down the stage there on the calendar on
[21:20] the chart is to Pentecostal ages from
[21:22] others are you don't hear not picked off
[21:25] the denomination because they've done
[21:26] just act like a layout of sins they are
[21:28] allowed as they are lay on the scene
[21:30] they did like a nick 11 but the true
[21:32] church see we're going in
[21:34] here here snow was coming down hit the
[21:39] image we're going rapture we shorted on
[21:41] another chart that we had right there I
[21:43] got that now watch he's talking my book
[21:49] the next service he has which is two
[21:53] days later it's called the house he's
[21:59] referring back to that same chart he
[22:01] didn't get a new revelation or tell
[22:03] about a tow-truck them and here's what
[22:06] happened the raptured Saints as you
[22:07] notice on the chart Sunday by him he's
[22:14] referring back to that chart that he
[22:16] grew two days earlier he must have been
[22:21] preaching on cue tonight because this is
[22:24] August the 8th and he preached the
[22:26] seventh week of Daniel on august 2 6 I
[22:29] think he preaches got house in Macon I
[22:35] think so but it does show it on here
[22:38] they will actually travel for two days
[22:39] maybe and priest being away he's
[22:42] referring back to the chart everybody
[22:44] got that
[22:44] okay whole thing so I believe that this
[22:50] chart is very true he wants you to he
[22:54] didn't just say well I'm going to draw
[22:55] this now change it no I think this is
[22:58] this is the way that the bank in two
[23:00] weeks is supposed to be it's just
[23:03] exactly the way that
[23:04] right so now I said ten o'clock would
[23:07] stop it being quite anybody any
[23:09] questions so far any questions comment
[23:13] go to them go one more thing and then
[23:16] we'll be finished because we're going to
[23:17] go back into this six fold purpose once
[23:19] we get into the to the seal then all
[23:23] right because we didn't really cover
[23:25] everything we kind of went through it
[23:27] but everybody got their chart of this if
[23:29] you don't I got several more working by
[23:38] now you got this
[23:42] we studied this just a little while if
[23:46] you don't have them there's several up
[23:47] here for you to get but the key to the
[23:50] whole thing is they stick for purpose
[23:51] because the six whole purpose happens
[23:54] and the last 17th week because let me
[24:01] ask you let me ask the question was
[24:05] Israel's transgression applied at
[24:10] calorie
[24:15] what brother Brown said brother Ramsey
[24:17] died for everybody did you start him
[24:21] down we accepted him but it will be
[24:24] applied see he finished look he finished
[24:27] everybody's transgression he ended
[24:28] everybody staying at Calvary but my
[24:31] question the other day was to those in
[24:33] Alabama I said look Jesus died once for
[24:36] all took the keys of death and helped
[24:38] heal his destroyed death is destroyed
[24:40] come on some people still die
[24:44] unbelief we got to get this word right
[24:47] once we get this word right then it will
[24:50] be applied
[24:51] we haven't applied to our soul right now
[24:53] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then
[24:55] please make sure you've got the Holy
[24:57] Ghost in your goal let's know it's time
[25:00] to put playing all right
[25:02] don't stop Peter people paddling around
[25:04] a little bit get the word born you ever
[25:07] have a form that's right when brother
[25:10] Brian preached the rapture message he
[25:12] went to that songs where talks about
[25:15] hide me and not pavilion to a lot of
[25:18] people that's the strangest scripture
[25:20] ever used for a rapture message but you
[25:22] gotta think about what that's saying
[25:24] hide me in your pavilion let me go into
[25:28] your pavilion because outside for me and
[25:30] we're gone
[25:30] we're dead we got to hide in his pearly
[25:33] nice crowd okay so the Bible says that
[25:36] there are six things that gotta be done
[25:38] finish the transgression make an end of
[25:39] sin reconciliation for iniquity bringing
[25:42] emulation righteousness fill up the
[25:44] vision and prophecy not the most holy
[25:45] that has to happen inside of the 70
[25:48] weeks of Daniel yeah now God started the
[25:51] redemption of mankind
[25:58] in the garden actually before the garden
[26:01] we know he was laying in the loo listen
[26:04] let's get down here let's get in this
[26:05] three dimensions right here where we're
[26:07] at okay cuz it was a landfill and four
[26:09] foundational world well why do we have
[26:10] to struggle we got something to doing
[26:12] this these dimensions right here and I'm
[26:14] working on sermon over dimensions and I
[26:16] think you'll really like it
[26:17] because uh that's what happens when God
[26:20] in the Garden of Eden he withdrew his
[26:22] cell remember he could come down in the
[26:23] cool of the day and walk with Adam face
[26:25] to face see God coming through also
[26:30] having dimension did not bother him a
[26:32] bit he owns them all he owned the hook
[26:35] he set him up he owned them all so he
[26:37] can walk through along but by the word
[26:40] he is limited
[26:44] I'll put enmity which is what Satan did
[26:48] put enmity between God and man that God
[26:51] put enmity what is enmity division he
[26:55] put a division that's why in hell has
[26:58] just looked over at Abraham and said
[26:59] there's a great gulf fixed when it's
[27:03] fixed that means you can't move in other
[27:06] words there was no way for Lazarus to go
[27:08] back I mean the rich young ruler sorry
[27:11] to go back toward Lazar
[27:13] there was a great gulf fixed what God
[27:16] fixed that Gulf now God can come down in
[27:19] this dimension but he closed up these
[27:21] three dimensions for a purpose now he
[27:26] can come down in spirit form but he
[27:28] cannot come down human flesh form yes
[27:32] sure why you say Jesus that was a human
[27:35] flesh that was born on earth not a
[27:38] glorified body I'm gonna make this thing
[27:42] man and I think I can back it up God had
[27:45] a flash the whole time
[27:52] God had fleshed the whole time just when
[27:57] he had to come out of that first three
[27:58] dimensions which is life life matter our
[28:00] length height and depth he won't go back
[28:05] into that because that's where sin is
[28:08] that's where it happened it didn't
[28:11] happen in the first day in the fourth
[28:13] dimension of the fifth dimension though
[28:15] those were all set up for things
[28:16] afterwards all right that's why the
[28:20] fourth dimension man the fourth
[28:21] dimension look it's just ruling through
[28:22] here right now roaring through there we
[28:26] can pick up anything all kind of stuff
[28:28] you pick up but it's closed off and only
[28:31] a little while can an angel come in or
[28:33] something happen because if we were able
[28:35] to look into another dimension we would
[28:38] see angel let me give you another little
[28:41] key them to chew on until I do the
[28:43] sermon you don't get a revelation in
[28:45] this dimension all right that's
[28:49] you don't get a revelation in this
[28:51] dimension this is life light matter this
[28:55] is living your daily life this is doing
[28:57] your daily duty this is you and your
[28:58] wife your family and your kids you don't
[29:02] get a revelation in estimation it has to
[29:04] come from another dimension into this
[29:08] now when we get that revelation that
[29:11] portal is going to open and we can go
[29:12] out this one in the other that dimension
[29:18] is in here okay oh man now we got your
[29:23] dancin we go away but I got a quote and
[29:31] I don't know where read it I really did
[29:33] I wanna read it I've been but I was
[29:35] thinking about Jesus and I want you to
[29:38] listen to this and I was not even
[29:40] looking for this I was studying on
[29:43] something that I read through some
[29:44] quotes but I hadn't put it with notes do
[29:46] I have to find it again I think I told
[29:48] you then brother Brown said the quote he
[29:54] said when Jesus was on Calvary
[30:01] god shut off the major
[30:06] so he could die
[30:11] God shut off the vision I've never read
[30:14] that before going Jesus on no Calvary
[30:16] God shut off its vision that's why he
[30:20] said my God my God my hands now over
[30:23] second man right so anyway when we say
[30:30] that people have to make up you never
[30:31] been right before or ever why do you
[30:33] think when he preached in tomato they'll
[30:35] run their run
[30:36] Oh from the back of the church to the
[30:38] front now get right up in your face that
[30:46] if we did that I told Louise I don't do
[30:49] that in one day three you making that
[30:56] happen and I thought that was coming to
[30:57] get me to take me out here comes two of
[31:00] them come out late with the center aisle
[31:02] and they come down that center alley for
[31:04] once
[31:07] so anyway there's more to dimensions
[31:11] than just being in a dimension these are
[31:14] these dimensions are here for a purpose
[31:17] everyone out of 4/5 saying it all up to
[31:19] the seventh dimension but you don't get
[31:21] a revelation in this dimension that
[31:22] revelation you get come from a seventh
[31:24] dimension it comes from the dimension
[31:27] that God thing because same thing give
[31:29] you revelation and you your personal
[31:33] self cannot give your self a revelation
[31:35] that's man's idea that turns these
[31:38] charts in all these different ideas but
[31:40] if we can get that portal open from the
[31:42] seventh dimension perfection and bring
[31:45] it to here and get the revelation then
[31:48] that's what revelation is gonna take us
[31:50] back there know that a false doctrine
[32:02] has to come to me from the fourth
[32:05] dimension demons travel and the fourth
[32:09] dimension and I'm studying you ought to
[32:13] read some of this stuff I mean you're
[32:14] talking about over something else
[32:16] because you go into what's that Stephen
[32:19] Hawking and all these people that are
[32:21] like way out somewhere they've done they
[32:25] know what dimensions are you know
[32:27] they'll twist them around and turn
[32:28] around but the most of your commentary
[32:30] will tell you that there is a fourth
[32:32] dimension that is calm but there's the
[32:38] fourth dimension as you continue to the
[32:39] fourth dimension this it goes chaos to
[32:42] hell now program said demons traveling
[32:45] fourth dimension but let me tell you
[32:46] something when you're talking on the
[32:47] phone to a believer you're talking in
[32:48] the fourth dimension
[32:50] so there's come then you keep going down
[32:54] further and further because I've always
[32:57] believed there's dimensions inside of
[32:59] dimension because when program went to
[33:02] the sixth dimension he didn't seek all
[33:03] right and Paul's group comes remember he
[33:06] asked a question he said did Paul make
[33:08] it went out he was looking at Paul he no
[33:11] Paul man so he's Church age
[33:13] their own dimension inside of that six
[33:15] dimension has to be and you know why
[33:18] because you know what they need to be
[33:20] kept separate until all things come back
[33:22] new because they with the understanding
[33:24] you know with tall people when in as
[33:28] Paul's group brother Brennan you know
[33:30] all the people that brother Joe was
[33:31] preaching on the right we're resting on
[33:33] that
[33:33] well that was brother Browns group that
[33:36] come under his ministry the millions
[33:38] just gonna be under his ministry he saw
[33:40] them the NC poultry Iranians Martin all
[33:43] of us anyway get off on that all right
[33:46] finish the transgression make an
[33:48] interstate a reconciliation for iniquity
[33:50] I guess that's all right I think there's
[33:53] level 10 dimensions and there's there's
[33:56] you can't say dimensions inside
[33:58] dimension what you can because there's
[34:00] some wall some wall inside web dimension
[34:04] that's why said the fourth dimension
[34:05] starts out calm and works its way to
[34:07] chaos and then works its way to hell it
[34:09] just keeps going down come on ously if
[34:13] you're listening to a tape online
[34:16] brother brown voices coming through the
[34:18] fourth winter if you listen to brother
[34:21] Vail or any of these brothers if you're
[34:23] listening to them online right and
[34:25] there's no hard connection it's kind of
[34:28] do that way is that right yeah what huh
[34:31] all that then you're listening in the
[34:34] fourth dimension it's coming throughout
[34:35] the fourth dimension it's not coming out
[34:37] all the god it's not coming but it's
[34:40] using the fourth dimension because ruin
[34:42] listen look forget it we gotta get faced
[34:44] with that change
[34:46] yeah I'll research later we'll talk
[34:49] about it I've already talked today about
[34:50] a little bit so anyway gonna look first
[34:56] read first three big since they
[34:59] dimension first three of the six vote
[35:03] purpose every bit of this was offense to
[35:06] Calgary but wasn't applied obviously it
[35:10] wasn't applied got blind in their eyes
[35:12] until what until a Gentile bride to be
[35:15] brought in right so then what's going to
[35:19] happen in that seventy weeks of Daniel
[35:22] he's gonna finish the transmission make
[35:24] an understand my reconciliation for
[35:26] iniquity how three to profits okay now
[35:31] if the aid if those damn Sam Louise ends
[35:34] as most people in the message believe
[35:35] then it ends right here
[35:37] where's you have three because six seals
[35:41] are six-fold redemption finishes
[35:44] finished six on purpose finishes their
[35:47] redemption the six seals finishes our
[35:49] redemption a man ma'am alright we get
[35:55] seal one two three four five six because
[35:57] it because there's early nineteen
[35:58] redemption in seven Christ is seven see
[36:01] this brother Graham says snake seals
[36:03] finishes redemption right so six full
[36:05] purpose finishes Israel's Redemption but
[36:08] you gotta add the land and the city in
[36:11] this one see this is God's Temple Mount
[36:14] amen but the Jews have to have a little
[36:17] temple because God promised that the Son
[36:19] of David will sit on a throne
[36:20] you can spiritual out there if you want
[36:22] there but the Bible said he come sit on
[36:24] the throne and judge the twelve tribes
[36:26] of Israel well he's going to be there
[36:27] winning his wife right right that puts
[36:31] us in here too but you got you can't
[36:34] bring in everlasting righteousness you
[36:38] can't do all six in that three and a
[36:39] half year period to me that's just
[36:41] common sense right you can't bring in
[36:44] everlasting righteousness fill up the
[36:46] vision and prophecy and on the most holy
[36:48] and then destroy everything and about
[36:50] water again and then you got to start
[36:52] all over again
[36:54] no.2 may have just don't fit but if
[36:57] you'll do it like this that fit after
[37:05] the Battle of Armageddon that Jubilee
[37:09] year bring in everlasting righteousness
[37:12] seal up the vision and prophecy what
[37:14] why do you gonna need to be made known
[37:16] anymore we're done we're finished we at
[37:22] that time the bride listen to me the
[37:24] bride at that time has no dimension
[37:28] listen people whom we get that glorified
[37:31] body and we move over and let this world
[37:35] get burned off what limitations doing
[37:38] that none you give it more defined body
[37:42] you're just as Jesus Christ amen
[37:48] cuz the Bible said were heirs and doing
[37:52] heirs with Jesus Christ if he gets the
[37:54] glorified body they can walk through the
[37:56] wall and still eat and enjoy himself
[37:58] we get a body they can walk through a
[37:59] wall those new dimensions fly in
[38:01] dimension bank for all right the only
[38:05] there's only one limitation in the
[38:07] Millennial Satan is still here but he's
[38:11] family
[38:12] okay but he will be destroyed at the end
[38:17] of that thousand years but now to me and
[38:21] you once we get a glorified body Saints
[38:23] destroy it anyway he's not even he's not
[38:25] even in the picture he can never come
[38:28] back into the picture that's why they
[38:33] st. can move through these dimensions -
[38:35] he speaks like God he's like I didn't
[38:38] say what Gotti glad God he can travel
[38:40] through I don't believe in going to six
[38:42] dimension but surely even going five
[38:45] surely he's had four and he is
[38:48] definitely in one term in 13 his name so
[38:51] he saying to move through these
[38:52] dimensions - but he can't come in his
[38:55] own body cuz he
[38:57] right I'm combining he has to work
[39:02] through somebody we got a guy who's got
[39:04] his own body but then God told us one
[39:07] day we'll have a body like his glorious
[39:09] mother yeah that connects us back puts
[39:11] the the the DNA picture back together
[39:14] that we didn't talk about the floor but
[39:17] that six for purpose has to end the
[39:21] seventy weeks of them seventy weeks are
[39:26] determined upon thy people and upon the
[39:29] holy city to finish the transgression
[39:31] make an end of sin by reconciliation for
[39:33] iniquity bring in everlasting rocks and
[39:34] still at the beach the property of
[39:35] normal totally know therefore and
[39:38] understand so what happened that one
[39:39] scripture the whole advance anyway
[39:41] seventy weeks are determined to do these
[39:44] six things and these six things have to
[39:46] happen inside of dang seventy week take
[39:49] your parentheses start it started 445 BC
[39:53] and then end it right here has to happen
[39:59] we read those quotes last Sunday some of
[40:03] them seem to be contrasted seem to be
[40:05] country but there's no way the brother
[40:07] Brennan can break scripture cannot good
[40:10] he's talking about the Ministry of Jesus
[40:13] Christ there's only in a seven-year
[40:15] ministry of Jesus Christ three and a
[40:17] half years there three and a half years
[40:18] here so in the last part of that 70th
[40:21] week he's talking about them the same he
[40:23] brings in my side my side my side on my
[40:25] side on my side my side
[40:26] Jesus Jesus dealers right but to me it's
[40:31] very simple but he say hidden mystery
[40:34] I'm telling you it is a mystery it has
[40:36] to come from the dimension that he
[40:37] started from the mind God had come
[40:41] okay so and I believe that you know as
[40:46] far as I'm concerned we've tried to
[40:50] bring it the best way we could and to
[40:54] give you both you know I'll just give
[40:56] you my angle this accessory is not
[41:00] supported by this out then well it is -
[41:03] anyway any more any question means they
[41:09] should not be a question in your honor
[41:11] I think we've combed this one as much
[41:14] Edwin Coleman okay
[41:16] and you know what don't fuss and argue
[41:18] with people if I start arguing about
[41:20] names at least everybody on ok you think
[41:21] about one preacher said it's a sham care
[41:23] you don't come back sitting under the
[41:26] table some I want to know how you react
[41:29] but it causes a lot of contention but
[41:32] you know what the words made to be
[41:35] preached it's not neat they're not made
[41:37] to be hid under a bushel that's why I
[41:39] brought out in 1977 the land in and and
[41:42] you know that's preaching the way you
[41:44] doing I don't let no that stuff bother
[41:46] me nobody don't don't listen that's okay
[41:49] that really come in right now go by the
[41:51] man you know you Jesus does not come
[41:54] down one day and like you said he said
[41:55] you don't have to preside father mother
[41:57] sister brother both of us all what
[41:59] you're doing don't be a fanatic listen
[42:03] don't be a fanatic when we get closer if
[42:05] it does happen in plane I think a fence
[42:07] will show us what's coming you hear me
[42:12] events will follow what word we take in
[42:17] comm out yes I believe God to give us
[42:20] revelation to come back whatever is
[42:26] coming because if you don't like a lot
[42:27] of change you've got to go all the way
[42:28] through you might get beaten banging
[42:31] around you might get knocked down bloody
[42:33] eyes bloody nose bloody lip but at the
[42:36] end you're gonna be standing over your
[42:38] home you know we need to shock you metal
[42:41] bowl of stuff but that was fictitious
[42:44] but still you got it were the underdog I
[42:45] mean
[42:46] where were the most beating defeated
[42:50] people that ever has been but you know
[42:51] what
[42:52] we got enough word to give something
[42:57] wait no questions but they've been 230
[43:00] something views on that now I know I
[43:03] have seven so I think we got this fast
[43:07] invited to the church to dry we'll see
[43:15] but you got to remember to now 11.4 we
[43:18] go thank you for reminding me left when
[43:22] we come up to the time and we're brother
[43:24] brian says you know garland on a church
[43:27] and then one he'll do more in one year
[43:28] you got to be careful let's not wait for
[43:31] that cuz the gentile doors he said would
[43:36] be closed so that means no more
