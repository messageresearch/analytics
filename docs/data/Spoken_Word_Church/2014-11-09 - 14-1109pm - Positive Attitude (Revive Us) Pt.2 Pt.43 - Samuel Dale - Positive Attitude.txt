TRANSCRIPT
========================================
okay there's a light in the window the table spreading splendor someone standing by the open door i can see a crystal river standing this world has been a wilderness is i this world has been a wilderness amen they drove her nails in my savior and his feet i didn't hear my god has out forsaken me but i believe it happened just like the bible said that a lonely man named jesus healed the sick and raised the dead called the lame the wall the gun and he called the blind to see i wasn't there but through faith i still believed wasn't there when they laid him in the tomb and sealed it with a stone wasn't there that morning when mary came running and said the lord was gone but i believe it happened just like the bible said that a lonely man named jesus healed the sick and raised the dead calls them lame to walk put i wasn't there but let's try number 107 in the uh red book we're going to be in d at the sounding of the trumpet when the things are gathered and we'll meet again together is and when the golden hearts are sounding in the angels then one again glory is that i may know him let's all stand now wonderful that i may know him wonderful his great resurrection and joy in fellowship is is know him it's no longer right who live now but christ who liveth in me in me jesus is alive in me it's no longer you believe it no longer is but christ who lived in me is amen amen

pour out your power and love as we think holy holy holy you'll find him amen good to be in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to where we were this morning in hosea 6 and then we'll go to joel 2. isaiah 6 joel 2. remember all the announcements that were made this morning remember this coming saturday now will be the fellowship meeting down at brother tony's and if you desire to go with us from up this way make sure you let us know we'll have everything ready and be able to go down in fellowship together and remember that we just received notice we did this morning but we had to wait we confirmed it brother harold hildebrandt had a heart attack so just remember him and pray the lord would would touch him and all he said he had a heart attack we don't know when or whatever what degree but you know just pray for him the lord would be with him brother all of us know brother hildebrand amen so remember that remember the ones that are sick among us and not able to be here and just pray that the lord would bless heavenly father we thank you for this day and your grace unto us and for thy word and we just ask you to come among us this afternoon in a mighty way and open your word unto us that we may see you lord and be led by your grace and love and understanding to each one of us forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you and just have your way with us remember all the sequins among us the different reasons for people not being here we pray that you would touch each one lord most of all remember the sin sick because that's the biggest problem lord let your light shine in each one of our hearts we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen hosea 6 and then we'll go to joy 2. come and let us return unto the lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight now it goes on down speaking of the former and latter rain upon the earth all right and we'll go to joel 2 and uh let's see we'll begin about 23 i guess be glad then then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he has given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god who hath dealt wonderfully wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that i am in the midst of israel that i am the lord your god and none else and what and my people shall never be ashamed you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now to try not to uh back up too far over this morning but to make sure that someone connecting in this afternoon would wonder well you know what was being said and all but you know to just try to get you to look at something we're talking about revival all right signifying a move of god in power and uh i know immediately people will in their mind will say revival's over it was over in 56 well we gave those quotes this morning to showing what the prophet had said and even said there would be no more great uh worldwide sweeping revivals we believe that but then he turned around and we read one this morning from white christ speak that it isn't over the we haven't had the revival yet all right now he's talking about something else then right then we covered how that um you know from this third seal where brother brown said the bride hasn't had a revival yet said he'd take those seven unknown thunders to wake her up well you know we uh we're just trying our best to bring together all of the uh things that have been said and make a beautiful picture and that picture remember is supposed to be uh not just a cow hanging up in a tree and grass growing on a rock and all kinds of things it's supposed to be a beautiful picture with all of the things in place and then once it's put into place then we can follow it throughout the word and the prophet would speak of revivals as it's like services that were going on all right and you know in the many things i hope you were following that this morning and to me then to say the revival's over but then to turn around and say we haven't had a revival yet well you know i believe both of those statements are correct you know and in doing that then we've tried to make ourselves clear about how that there was not going to be any more worldwide sweeping revivals the next time that that move comes would be to israel through the two prophets you know the heavens closed the different things happening and that would be that part but we're not looking for a worldwide sweeping revival but yet at the same time why can't we believe in a revival you know all right and we we ended up talking about that the prophet said that azusa street 1906 was the greatest revival you remember that was all for the church choosing law for grace in 61 that it's the one of the it was the greatest revival you know since the day of pentecost a worldwide sweeping revival all right it was the promise that we read in the scriptures down to stop and stopped on that he said you know and pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters to do this that the other your handmaids and all which would be poured out upon everything in the last days and that would be the azusa street revival time that was a great revival he called it the greatest since the day of pentecost all right so we believe that so then it's not just throwing it out with a revival's over well i guess azusa street didn't have one you know and that's the way you you would make people to think but see those things are statements that we use for our own benefit as i said we close our mind off we hear something our mind is closed uh one man said one time he said um our minds are crystallized on this thought i thought you know really you you we're not mechanics never been but but crystal eyes breaks you now we used to we had to because we couldn't do nothing else but we used to take them off and sand them well you know they'd work for about three times putting on the brakes and and then you was right back in the same problem you was because once it's crystallized it won't do no good so if you say your your mind is christianized about a revival there ain't gonna be no revival my mind's crystallized well then cut her off we'll see you next time maybe we'll have a topic later that you can understand you know but see then we think that we are so um revelated and the point right at the lights that i was trying to get across that the zeus street pentecost was as the prophet said the greatest revival since the day of pentecost and yet the people in that was looking forward to something else instead of you know even rejoicing and going on with what they had they was looking for a time to come that there'd be a worldwide sweeping revival and experiencing the greatest that the prophet said had been since pentecost you know well you know that would have been even on up into the 12 13 that was the name of jesus being restored coming on up and coming up to the time of the prophet and and all like that coming into view in the 30s and and things and he speaks of a great that was still a great revival going on you know all right i was telling them while i go downstairs we we baptist and all we didn't have no right to be in no line of our day of revival was over but i can remember in the 50s when that you know i mean you had great things going on and uh you know this is kind of what you call this little missionary baptist style churches but they'd have great times they'd have great healing i mean you know how healings they'd have revivals and things would take place and shouting all over the house and you know and all of that and like i told you i've seen them there at the old church at gillsville and there was a cemetery right behind the church and the men would go down one way and the women would go down the other and the women walked right down in the woods you know what no swept out concrete thing is right down in the woods and get down and have prayer meeting you know well you know we're up there playing but i can still remember that made a mark in my mind that those ladies the men you could understand but you know my point is that there was a great moves and things going on but we baptist was just shouting in the after effects as you'd call it of the pentecostal revival that was taken had taken place but now when the prophet came along he didn't deny that as being true he spoke of it as being true you know good and great all right well we didn't have nothing going on until the prophet came on the scene well you go ahead and talk all you want to about it but you won't fit it in the prophet's message nor the bible all right but now think about it but i want you to get one point i tried to emphasize it a little bit this morning that brother branham would talk about pentecost you know that pentecost begin and will never stop the baptists begin and stop methodist presbyterian the pentecostals began and stopped but the same revival that was in the days of martin luther was the same revival in the days of john wesley just in a little higher form of the word and it keeps going right on down a pentecost revival because pentecost is 50 and that's the holy spirit all right so then we should never worry about that but now all the other things will die away because we find out then that they were not necessarily true that's what we want to deal with just for a second if the brothers will start on number 11 kind of where we got to but look what he says about this and you'll get the point of what i'm trying to drive at might as well put my cough drop in because i'm having troubles with that old sinuses but that's all right all right this is taken from the message of the sumerian church age 1960-1206 but you see it was a hybrid thing hybrid see it didn't have any life in it and they cannot go back no more that's the reason they'll never rise the lutheran revival never did rise up again the wesley revival never did rise up again the nazarene revival did not rise up again neither will the pentecostal revival rise up again why because they killed it you hybred it with a world and with a nickelodeon idea not let the holy spirit have its way all right now see but to me now like i just say it pentecost begin without an end you need those statements we're glad to find it and each age was pentecost see each age had a revival each age had a move of god because that's pentecost all right the pentecostals they were having a move of god you know but a lot of them prove that it was wrong by the fact of dying or denominating hybrid and things instead of going on with the word all right see then something happened that was an amazing point all right something took place back in the times of you know when uh when the pentecostal revival began to be dying down that's when the prophet came on the scene all right and as he did now watch worldwide sweeping revivals over with but yet look what he calls the revival of the times of where he was at and what is going on go ahead and pull up the next one which is calling jesus on the scene 1964 319 good little bit of reading but just go with me now you have witnessed one of the greatest revivals i believe that the world has ever seen now you're not talking about zeus street he said in these last 10 15 years huh it's been a revival not just like the days of billy sunday watching or the days of the wealth revival are the days of the westland revival or the moody revival or billy's sunday revival it's been a worldwide sweeping of fire around the world great healing services and great revival fires is burnt on practically every hill there is in the world right tonight way over in the land of africa down in china and japan this gospel is being preached and people are being healed right this very minute around and around the world it's been one of the greatest revivals because i believe it's one of the life's revivals this world will see a world sweeping revival well now he's talking about his day right are you with me all right watch them i remember of having what i remember of having the privilege by the holy spirit to spearhead that revival that started now he's not talking about azusa street it's in his day right when the angel the lord appeared on the river and said that about many years ago and to see it happen and see it set ministers hearts of fire everywhere revivals broke out well you could just simply walk into a building and the people just get up out of their scots and stretchers and walk away healed you didn't even have to say one word just just being there that's all it taken i remember one night in vandalia vandela illinois i walked into the meeting and had no more being in the meeting over five minutes and there wasn't a feeble person around the place anywhere what about a great time wheelchairs pushed out and piled up blind was seeing deaf and dumb speaking and just simply the spirit of the lord was present and he just healed a whole group of them now that's where you can do something when revival is going on but let that revival fire die down fire die down then you can hardly the people are still christians but they're not revived into that spirit that great atmosphere that goes something all right now bring it on up we'll get the lights and that's what it takes to have a revival is everybody under the heat of the holy spirit that's brought down the powers of god and a revival moving then there is a prior meeting going on day and night every minute everywhere why the people would even wouldn't even leave the grounds all right now he was talking about his own ministry in the time of the great healings see because it was promised in malachi 4. you know behold i send you elijah he'll turn the hearts of the children and but what is right back before then in malachi that the son of righteousness would rise with healings in his wings now listen very carefully for a moment in the pentecostal revival azusa street there was a lot of healings and signs and wonders there is with every revival you know i mean it's always been when a revival goes forth there's always signs and wonders goes with it healings and different things right but never was there an age like we have just passed to work like the prophet said you could just walk right into a building and people be healed why because that was something taking place other than just a reviving there was something taking place in the times of brother branham that was more than reviving you know more than just a move a shouting it was a time of the sign of the resurrection you agree with me the sign of the resurrection that's why he was talking about the son of man all right and it said he would rise with healings in his wings all right see brother branham what most people don't listen to listen to him enough to understand see he preached about 30-something years just as a restoration of us back to the bible that paul and them had preached now i wouldn't the one that said it he goes the future home goes a different one rapture and he said not in the years of preparation but when the message would come forth brother brown's message then began all the rest was restoration but in 1963 when the seals opened he was to bring his message all right but had it not been a rising of the healings in the wings right that was divine healing but at the same time this revival was going on to revive people it was to be the bringing of all of the word right that would be the purpose what did he say he said you don't show them the hook you show them the bait he said the healings and the signs and wonders was the bait for them to get the hook the hook was the preaching of the gospel that's why i read this one to where he said see it comes down to what the word is saying great sweeping times all right and knowing that the great associate street was gone right now i'm talking about the move of azusa street not the pentecost now i explained that a moment ago because brother brown's message goes right on into pentecost the great opening of the word but a split condition took place back there and he would call it the greatest revival or a sweeping revival look at the next one letting off the pressure in 1962. and watch what he's saying now i've kind of listened and watched my pentecostal brethren as they have predicted a sweeping revival coming and we all know that the revival that we just went through has ceased well but there must be coming something else that's glorious and great are you reading and also i've been studying hard to find these places in the scripture i think that if our revelation must be scriptural and then we know it's right it's the scripture it's from the lord and i'm beginning to believe that that's right that there's coming a ripening time for the evening fruits all right then he would have to have the former rain if you need these be glad to get them he said you say you've had a lot of rain he says nonsense he said you haven't had the former rain yet the former rain is the teaching rain all right now this revival now this this today that we're in to me is the greatest of all revivals even the two witnesses after we leave they without us cannot be made perfect right they're depending on us to come to a place right so then every revival now you listen to what i'm saying every revival prior to us where it be the church ages as a revival for each age whether it be the great pentecostal azusa street revival or even whether it be the great healing campaign revival of the 30s to 40s the 50s and into the 60s spearheaded by brother branham's ministry and yet he still says there's something to come come on but you see that's our problem we think if god was with us we'd be seeing great signs and wonders you know remember you are facing the worst attack of any time in the whole bible that has ever been you are facing satan and let me quote brother branham where he says the perfect anti-anointing now that's what he said about it says you're facing him with a perfect anti-anointing in other words the top echelon of all demons has been poured out i'll get to this more in another message but brother branham says the holy ghost had been bound for two thousand years at the door of creeds and dogmas but to be loosed in the evening time by this message all right the worst attack that has ever been is now upon us it would be easier to go back and walk up to a line and slap it until it come on it'd be easier to walk out of a catholic church and face the basis that you're being excommunicated we're in the greatest time that has ever been all of those revivals that you could talk about even down to the one in this day when brother brown said to just walk into a room and everybody and i'd be healed but yet we thank all god was he poured into brother branham all brother branham was he died and took it with him or something you know it's because we've got set in our mind what a revival is to us a revival is a great rejoicing a great this or a great debt i'm trying to tell you the greatest revival there is is the opening of of god's word the opening of god's word to you and i is the greatest revival because it is the cult what do you call it the ending of the the finishing of all revivals is here today and yet we think well i don't see no revival going on you know why you don't see a revival going on because you don't have within you now i'm going to ruin it two folks so hold on first off you don't have within you the holy ghost or you can be revived because only those with the holy ghost can be revived right the bible's not for the sinner or you have been taught so much by mankind until you're blinded to the truth of a day and the greatest revival that could ever be you mean we're going to end it all up but yet we're going to end it up in a small manner you mean the greatest of all things has come upon us and we're just going to sit here well i used to be able to get to church every service but i just can't do it now i just can't make it well that's up to you it has come to the basis that more things are important to us now instead of being at church in the word of god right if not what's going on huh well brother dale you're you're doing this doing that it's what i said the truth well why are you putting names to who i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about you you are the one i'm talking about because the others are not here okay we'll get on to that in the next message lord willing but listen all of those demons what is it in i've got it in the notes but for the next service all of those demons that was in the river euphrates everyone said it was looked on the jews to drive them to the homeland right we'll get back to it and read it he said that was in the 40s you know and he said about 20 years later he's loosed on the bride the driver to the message of the hour all that great army of the cankerworm palm worm locust caterpillar and you know he doesn't have any problems saying my army that i sent among you and we know he's not the author of the cankerworm world and all of that right but he said i permitted that i raised up the army to come against you you know i allowed it to raise up russia has been raised up blessed of god to annihilate the rest of us one day he said you mean god will do that he's got to have somebody to do it but think about it he said the revival that we just went through has ceased now if you want to make that is azusa street that's fine with me but if you want to make it as it he saw and am i right to what he said he said i see that even my ministry is not having the effect that it had now what about a man see the dead raised sick healed and a thing happened but at that time would say things was going pretty bad but yet turn around and say i'm looking for a bride to be here that will strip satan of all his powers he ever thought he had do you understand what i'm saying you say are you looking for a revival no no let's get that right i've been in a revival i'm experiencing a revival you know what brother dale i've seen you i've seen you beat down i've seen you in troubles and heartaches and problems what's that got to do with it see it's because you have it figured out what you think a revival is to be you've got it figured out as to what's to happen in this day but can you put it in the word i mean can you put it in the word whatever you got in other words i ask you to say you know all right you believe so and so brother mark show me in the word you should be able to do that or you shouldn't be believing something you know the bible said to be ready to give an answer of the reason of the hope that lies within you well see i believe that god sent us a prophet and the signs and the wonders was to get the attention and he had to bring a restoration back to the faith of the fathers that's why when he got there you know beyond the curtain of time he said i preached what paul preached see he stood there knowing that he'd preached the bible to the letter go to spoken word as the original seed and see if i'm right or not that's right and even the holy spirit vindicating it by showing for him to write and he wrote it and it come down to the basis but said as of yet malachi 4 is not fulfilled all right what would you do if you seem that way he knew there was something to come remember my definition of pentecost it never ends the day we walk out of this world will be our day of pentecost the day we meet the lord in the hour will be our day of pentecost you're talking about a revival but why can't we see now but you ask people how you do well we're going to be well you know i'm having all these problems i don't know why everything's against me i believe the word why can't you rejoice even when you're at your lowest point i would not say this i'm going to say it anyway you can get upset with me if you want to dick addison look at me don't you ever sit over there and say that you're coming down with alzheimer's that's been on me for two ever since you said it don't you ever say that again in this church don't come in here talking like that to any of you because you're making your confession and it'll go to what you're saying i'm sorry if i don't go over good forgive me but it's burdened me for ever since he said it don't do it stripes i'm healed if i get better i thought the prophet said that getting worse was the greatest sign you were healed am i missing that when are we going to start this being that away and you'll see why i've always been that away right ain't nobody in this church can come out and say that that ain't been me since i've been pastor here my testimony has always been positive always positive about god's word always looking for god to do something does it matter how sick we are or what's going on so you're saying if god will heal me i believe that we're in revival if you understand what i've tried to bring you see why i cut off because i know good get all i wanted to say the prophet's message was the former reign the holy ghost quicken it is the latter rhine all right now you mean to tell me we have had the greatest message that the world has ever heard we have a message within our possession that the world has waited on that the prophet's desire to look into that everything that's been backed down is speaking of you and i but yet we want to just play around with it well i get feeling better i'll tell everybody i'm healed well don't worry about it you ain't gonna tell nobody go and tell the doctor right he's wanting a little money he needs a vacation go ahead you know ain't nothing wrong with going to doctors you know better because when we got our confidence in them right instead of our confidence being in god amen cause come on they're gonna tell you the best they can because they don't want to cut they don't want to lose you as their customer right i've never found a doctor yet wanted to lose customers if you you know i mean they want you to come back but listen look at what your prophet had to say and i want you to notice the year of 1956. when he said i predict the revival's over i predict that america will turn against the gospel and look what he said at that time go ahead and pull it up brother elisha the prophet in 1956 1002 raised on there's not a hope left to this nation as i see only an old-fashioned revival and according to the scripture it'll never be nationwide you know maybe you don't listen to what i just read i read where he said in 60 what was it 62 64. calling jesus on the scene that his message spearheaded a great sweeping revival that's what i don't understand about these people are the message i mean if you want to find a lot of contradictions call me up sometime i'll try to help you to dig your own hole because anything right around says you can find a quote almost directly against that but it all comes together and makes a beautiful picture once it's revealed but we don't want to wait till it's revealed look it'll never be nationwide so then we're just left it'll be a revival among the people the elect of god but it won't be a real sweeping revival take the whole nation in never was and never will be and he just said he predicted that america would turn down the gospel what about it church what are you putting your bases on what are you basing your your thoughts on remember this is life or death i mean we're going to be haphazard let's just go on back and join the denominations and just have a good time you know if we just kind of carried down just a little bit wouldn't be so strong on water baptism or something we'd be tickled they'd be tickled to have us because we could preach messages right out of the bible they'd never heard of and they would love to have us as long as we leave certain things out well if we're not going with all of it why not quit right why not just quit and get out of it but yet if you understand what i'm trying to bring he said it's for the elect now turn on a tape when you get home any one tape any word that you want to put it on of any year or any time of the year and listen to that tape and come back and show me the man was so negative until he didn't know what was going on oh we're all having problems we're all having troubles did you ever hear a man like brother branham with as positive of an attitude as the man had i'd love to be able to sit down and talk to the lord jesus you know what he was a human being he had troubles you know he had heart aches and problems but he was never negative he was always positive brother branham was always positive even he'll tell the story that god took his wife away and god took his child away he said honey i'll lay you on your mom's arms because the angel's coming to get you lord give us the lord taketh away man asked him later said brother branham said did you keep your religion during the time of the death of your wife and daughter he says no he said my religion kept me what about it has your religion kept you you see why my attitude is always positive not just when you call me and ask me how i'm feeling and i say wonderful when i'm hurting like crazy because they don't have anything to do with it i'm saying what god says remember the message the other day there is no negativism in christianity you remember that but you just never have been like i've been well according to the prophet if you've prayed and committed everything to god i'm paraphrasing his statement but it's pretty close and god don't come on the scene to heal you he said god's testing you he said hold on you remember the quote we read where you say we haven't had a re he said revival it hasn't come yet just hold on revival for the elect when he got in the seal book he said i call you bride this message was not sent to the world now get my point of what i'm doing azusa street the spirit was poured out upon all flesh the world benefited by it right right brother brown's ministry of malachi 4 rising with healing in his wings the world benefited by the message that the man brought but the world won't never benefit about this message that i'm talking about this revival is only for the bride it's not for anybody else the foolish virgins yeah they can receive i know the message i know what it says third pull is for the bride to the church and uh for the bride and the foolish virgin and to the totally lost but listen church just for a minute joel said the former and the latter reign hosea said the former in the latter rain see there can't be a latter rain until you first have a former man all right see so the prophet brought the former reign he cannot be the holy ghost so he can't quicken it you remember the quote we read the pastor can't bring the revival brother branham couldn't bring the revival he could deliver to the people the word of god the revival will be among the people the revival will come among you and i listen at him in 1955 during that time that you'll say the revival was over nothing's taken place we're just sitting around waiting on the bus to pull up i believe that that is the time that the church has arrived at today that the next great move in the church is for god after we've seen the false alarms but now god will place in his church correctly apostles prophets teachers evangelists not man made seminary bolton but god will place into the church not theology runovers and overnights but god will place in the church as god has chosen as the holy ghost had tutored this church and raised it up and in thou god will adopt into into the position of his sons they're already his sons whether they are worthy of the position that he has for them you know that's still in the message look at the next one where it says a deceived church 1959 god send us another church just before the end time that the power of the holy ghost can come into her in the demonstrations of the spirit and mark 16 can follow the church acts 2 and 4 acts 2 and 38 all of it with will be following right along with the church signing wonders accompanied the apostles great signs of his resurrection accompanying them while they were in prison surely god's growing a crop somewhere for this life's kill great kill may it be my christian friend here this morning may it be your strength has begun to grow i pray for this message samson got his eyes put out looked like lost all hopes but he cried out one more once more lord and he killed more in his own death when he pulled a building down then he killed in his life he died of victory death that's no problem if you're afraid of dying then you you need to be praying a little bit get that kind of straightened up because it's a little something shaky there you say now wait a minute you no we're human yeah but you see church somebody is going to take this message and it'll be revealed to him see it'll be made to a point that he said the fifo ministry would take this message and break it down bring it to the people but yet nobody wants to trust to fight for ministry and hey i don't mind saying it i don't trust them either okay you know what i mean by that the biggest portion or not trying to because this is not trying to pump up a revival we used to we had old bicycles and we had old tires and we had an old patch that you glued on well you know you take an old vulcanized patch and boy you could after that come out it was really great and you could just pump that thing up and the whole to be this big well you said man that'll stay don't do that when you're gluing one when you're gluing it stick it real good put the inner tube inside the tire right to where that the patch will hit the wall and hold make sure it's good straight not crooked and then pump it up you know what are you getting at brother dale i'm getting at one thing i don't think we're in the days of the pump up tires i think we're in the day that we should be realizing who we are and what's going on and how that god has reserved for his bride the greatest revival as i said while ago and emphasized it over and over that every revival only spoke of this revival all of that that's what we've talked about the great moves of god brother brandon we read this morning where he said to be a short do it but he never backed off where he said limbs would be restored he never backed off in the quote word of israel would see god coming after us and think they're coming after them former letter rain former rain is a teaching reign the latter rain is a quickening or harvest or may i say it this way a revival of the former rain was this message that went around the world in a great revival of healings and wonders because it was promised in god's word and if that would be the former reign what are we to expect in a lot of rain come on folks somebody call you up to pray for me ain't no need to parade well there ain't no need of it if that's the way you think all right now you don't need to pray you know i know one brother that fellow come with him to be praying he said i'm worse shape than you are well that's re that's really uplifting you know right i mean you call me up you say brother there will you pray for me i don't know where you've got enough energy or not i'm in a bad shape today i'll tell you why it's been rough you better call somebody else pray for you and you probably wouldn't call me very much and i will go ahead and say it when i'm at it most of you don't call me to pray for you you call other people geek your own grace you will come eventually right back to here i'm putting that out and forget it i don't have anything wrong with you calling other people to pray for you but brother dale i don't want to bother you with my troubles i thought that's what the pastor was you know you ain't never heard me say nothing like that but you see let's get our priorities straight get our lives in order we'll get on it next service where brother branham said even just one little unconfessed sin will cause a church to bitterly fail and that you'll answer for it it's a day of judgment he said what's that got to do with revival you can't have a revival till you get rid of the dead you can't revive the dead right you revive the living the dead can't do it take on these things you have problems just write down your questions and give them to me i'll be glad to cover them i want to make sure one thing that you understand me we're not looking for a worldwide sweeping revival no survey we're not looking for another azusa street revival we're not looking for another of brother branham and his ministry and that revival but you know what people will say well brother ryan said we wouldn't go to empty hospital he didn't say you could empty half of it you go in the hospital you know well i'm going in there to pray for some brother and all that brother branham said that there's no such thing as empty nose i'm not going in to empty the hospital i'm going to pray for one person but see i can get all of that unbelief you know what might as well stay at home that's the truth all right see positive about it be positive we are the bride of jesus christ he saved the best of life i didn't make the story book i'm just glad to be on the live page right you know what if he brought paul up here paul couldn't stand it we'll have to i'll talk to him when i get there one of these days he'll know what i'm saying right those people couldn't take it you see them it died of the lines and the different things yeah because you didn't listen well ago when i said this is the worst age if any age has been capable of signs showing that a revival is present it's this age when insanity is on every hand the enemy has come in from every side but the spirit of the lord will raise up a standard do we believe that who are we bragging on come on musicians take on these things what do you think about a revival well i still believe there ain't no revival going home when i tell me what you believe it about and we'll see what we can do about it all right with golly okay paragraph 45. all right this is taken from speak to this rock and uh i don't see the date but speak to this right god's given ever sick person in here divine healing every one of you jesus was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed it's yours but you'll have to fight for every inch you possess everywhere the soul of your feet travel god told joshua i have given you footprints means possession let's move in tonight amen let's go in footprints is possession let's take every inch of ground that god gives us if you haven't got the baptism of the holy ghost peter said that promise is unto you and your children and them that are for all as many as the lord our god shall call let's step into it walk into it let's stand together and believe it we're all healed right well now you know whose fault it is we won't blame it on somebody else right it's our fault what do we got we're going to try number 49. y'all anybody knows what's wrong with this thing tell me 49 in the red book 49 in the red we praise thee o god for the son of thy love for jesus hallelujah we praise thee oh god for the spirit of life hallelujah blind and glory hallelujah amen hallelujah by the glory revive us again all glory and hallelujah again revive us again hallelujah hallelujah is who has i know that the reason i don't try to sing a lot but i know i first got my game again but you know i sure do like to make a little joyful noise you know and i don't understand well i'm not going to sing because my voice is bad well let me whisper let me do something all right go ahead from hallelujah hallelujah all glory and hallelujah hallelujah we're being sympathetic in jesus name again we've praised anybody hallelujah hallelujah uh the hallelujah god for the son of jesus who died for the spirit is you know these little kids gonna make us ashamed of herself they get sick now probably they come to be prayed for we carry ours along a lot of times but they believed amen hallelujah oh hallelujah oh again anybody else before we go amen bring a revival lord and let it start and me you know it's starting me remember we were talking about him down there today you know that welts or which one it was you know that the man said where's the revival he said you're looking at it well i was looking at a quote it's in one of these quotes here and it was like some vikings or something brother brown said when they went i can look it up and show you but so then when they went to a country he said the first thing they done was burn their boats he said because they wouldn't going back he said that's what they're doing said when they reached land they burned their boats he said because he wasn't going back he said that's the way we ought to be go forward with no place to go backward because if you ain't got a boat to carry back across you're stuck so settle it feel it in your mind today if this message is right let's believe it let's stand on it and say thank you lord i don't have any uh swift bank account just in case things don't go right materialistically i don't have nothing reserved over just in case this message ain't right because i believe it it's brought god to me and i believe it what about you lord jesus we thank you for today and we know it's been a poor example of the ways and thanks to present it but i pray that the people would believe and understand that we're looking lord for you to come among us and revive us lord wake us up get us ready because we know there won't be any more ages and times it's got to be this time and got to be this age so they're not looking for something else that way we're looking for you to manifest yourself among us in where we're at now we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen you dismissed this is the evening time is here
