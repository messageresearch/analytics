========================================

but what made a joke Blackfoot that were never guilty I mean barefoot this barefoot railroad over there there's somebody lives in he said the sounds they'll preach up that broken what broken yeah that's right seven thunders I can't remember the guys name and he's an older gentleman but he know he's not a it's not somebody that's real familiar so didn't have going there but another revolution [Music] [Applause] party out there is break the wind come back she should know I was in the car for 12 hours for the kids all right let's get started hearing back in the book of Romans no we were talking about last Sunday we were talking about circumcision versus uncircumcision and we know that it's the circumcision in the heart not the circumcision of the flesh but now watching because Paul has to come back because you can't take you can't take natural circumcision in a way because it's in the Bible right because that's what they depended on in the Old Testament they depended on that circumcision because that's what God said likes an Abraham for a sign going circumcise yourself and your household and everyone after this as a sign that I have accepted your faith guess what right here says with what advantage then have the Jew or what profit is there of circumcision nay that's in question much every way chiefly because that unto them were committed the Oracles of God Paul couldn't deny that God came to Israel first gave them a covenant gave them something to live by until he would come so you can't do away like the old text to me you can't do away with the Old Testament so the Old Testament that circumcision but let's keep reading because Paul's gonna bring it right back in and say well we know before that it was all certainty you were circumcised you were do if you were in the border of Israel or the house of God now it's the circumcision of the heart or the inward man all right watch much every way chiefly because that unto them were committed the Oracles of God all again not denying that God came to his request we came to know that God came to him from first and gave them something to live by okay for what if some did not believe in other words once Paul say there were many people that were physically circumcised they didn't live they did live the law that did work even really even in the Jewish ground they were murderers and Liars and you know one thing so what's he saying him for what if some did not believe he's actually doing question he said now shall Berlin believe made the faith of God without effect because the faith of God was that Abraham said I'm gonna have a child and God said see little circumcision and that would be a sign unto you that you believe me but not everybody bleed just like now but you can't have a circumcision of the heart of now definitely Jesus know you can search me to the heart now and be a believer now there's some things you can't understand there is something that you don't believe back to a point but you've got to come to something because their heart is a believer I was telling them this morning in the inn brother that I told them I said how many of you seen Jesus jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father I said what did they say they stopped or or what was Philip do and Philip said you're talking about this father to Jesus in John 14 you're talking to me about that father you're telling us father did this and father did that and the father does this and I'd work this in the father where's the father Philip said I mean Jesus said Philip come on having been so long with you if you've seen me you've seen the father so when I told them inside the class I think you never seen do you want no fellow cannot say that Philip saw Jesus that and then but we didn't know Jesus dark rum so we have to be believers that's why you know I told her we were sitting there and under the under the umbrella of being a believer we believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins and that the heavenly father was any I didn't get into the Trinity but the heavenly father was any doing the work so that's what Jesus said well they kind of looked at me a little struggle when I said look if Jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father I said now he's lying if that's not what happened yeah so whatever Jesus did is what the father did just like me it's like I was talking about us with a DNA marker a genetic marker I won't let my grandpa let say the father you won't like think Lord Donnie public you know time walk down the aisles for 20-something years I mean that and Duty comes and now you watch you go watch Donnie Donnie is the same I mean you can just take the top part of 90 off and you wear it was Tom why because there's a genetic marker inside Donnie that came from daddy that he can't get away from you can't get away from that so the same thing with the Heavenly Father that's what I said if you become a Christian that's what led to my story about if you were put on trial could they convict you being Christian I said Jesus said I went home to John 14 20 and said I and you and you and me and I said it's not to Jesus and I told him I said why don't we pray looking up what's the did Moses said he ain't him up there Jesus says he's not a very rich and I'm gonna come back and be with you in you have to meet right here Noddy you know so that's what I said I said now can you commit to being a Christian so same here but but circumcision didn't you know what we can all go say well we've been circumcised they probably a hundred percent of people know there's probably 90 percent of people that's been circumcised angle maybe the help physically physically and them too because it says in other words what's he's saying the same way I'm with you now but it doesn't believe makes the faith of God but effective when you say don't believe that just put there stop the whole process god forbid yeah you let God be true but every man a liar in other words I can be circumcised and it really just like I told y'all last Sunday you have nothing to do with certainty your Enzo please the clay you understand what I'm saying physically you didn't have a choice and a male complete an Internet you know they do better than that and your parents did it right it was the parents they put it to it what does you know so come in yes and you look in different cultures and they don't so throw it away it's just not like I said and that's what he's saying god forbid you can't make this a book God a believer there's only certain like you know you and and really that's what Paul was saying about whoever was Timothy when you think within a temple come on play with your flesh but they're like incoming in area to file in the temple you know he circles out well you know what they must have checked him out how they do it but pulse it Oh God that's what he's saying here come on are we gonna make it a belief that we have to be circumcised no God forbid forget about you can be an unbeliever and be circumcised but you can't be an unbeliever be circumcised in the heart when you should get a circumcision in the heart that favor tonight cuts off that hole thanks this flesh and gets rid of that let God be true but every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy Saints and - overcome when thou art judged but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God why shall we say is gone and righteous should take this vengeance I speak to the man they inflated god forbid but then how shall God judge the world in other words he's going to knock there to judge the world my circumcision like I said if you flesh even at the day of judgment the people are going to walk up in the flesh they send in but that flesh is not what there's what's gonna send them to hell it's being unbelievable what's going to send you to the other place the for if the truth of God hath more abounded through my life and into his glory why yet and I also judge as a center somebody must have brought something up against Paulo and not rather these different waiting as we be slanderously reported now some has must have said fall of something else Paulo you're a sinner you're doing there she doing it and you know what happens you look at Paul's life we may look at Jesus's life they say he was a sinner they say he was born of fornication a lot I've ever loved to hang around prostitute from sin and they call it a meals both anyone Almighty God so same way of a Paul Paul you can't be of God let's don't get before you though they keep you out they try to kill you they've done legions looking for you probably you can be of God alright he said I think hey talk about that he said look why don't we saying that much do evil that good may come whose damnation is just let us do evil then what's he saying he's saying I'm gonna do something bad intentionally so that I get something good out of it no that's not you know that was I do that's not a right you don't want to do something well out a great couple of beers and see what God's gonna do you know I know you're tempting God and that's what he's fixing to say you're tempting God and don't tempt i what then are we better than they knowing no eyes no look for we have before proved both Jews that they are all under sin so call disprove the big blanket up dancing we're all up whether they you circumcised whether you go to the temple with you is this they'll marry whatever okay or at all understand that's why I like to start at that point and there was a guy walked up to me afterwards because I told him about in my 20th anniversary was in June of 1998 one of your school graduation anniversary well I was part of them of the officers so we got all hit with any way you look at everything together and only the four file that was around me knew who I was and the other one saw men they voted me the most changed person will see I had a conversion the Christian conversion back in December of that year from December to Jim they declared that I was a different person than the guy walking a minute this morning they said yeah I'm stood I couldn't remember when you know when you was a little bit different than you are now I said yeah I said thank thought of it that you he can't remember whether you remember nothing that's okay God can't remember there's gotta be a conversion there's the transforming that's what we're talking about this evening coming from coming from the new birth that we talked about last Sunday about the old person must be dead if the old person staying somebody's got to come to life cuz can't you stay in the old man's dead then something has to come alive right so and I believe that that's what the Heavenly Father said he said I'll come and take up my abode in you why then say are we better than they know and no eyes for we're before food both Jew and Gentile that they're all understand I'll read verse 10 as it is written there is none righteous no not one all right now I'm gonna read you in the Greek and you read along I do that last Sunday in the Greek it's that are in the young Greek it says what then is the superiority of the Jew or what profit is there of circumcision much in every respect but first indeed because they were entrusted with the Oracles of God and like I said the people in the Old Testament they were given something to live by and God honored that I've gone on her name of him faith by giving him the sign of circumcision and that side continued on until the day that sign of certainty that I say it's time of a holy God but but a time now since the Holy Ghost did country for what if some did not believe will their unbelief but know the fidelity of God now that's verse 3 read that for some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of God without faith original sense well what if some did not believe what you want will their unbelief annulled the fidelity of God in other words unbelief will never override the faith of God that's right never because it makes the face of God without effect now some people can do it but if you would know that if you have that circumcision of the heart you want I believe you can't overtake you if you're a believer because you gotta believe like I said my son you've got to believe something you gotta believe the oh you died I don't care if you say the soul died or the ferret died or the nature died or whatever it's on that the nature that old soul that old spirit that you have if you were born and then God give you a soul then Satan what Satan does is what I believe he just attaches itself to that but he can't give you a soul or make yourself right he can't even take yourself he really can't take a sinner so he can Oh God going and touch that soul on that person that's why that we we see that I see in continuity of God that when we come to the Millenium see this man is gonna destroy the earth human beings are going to die but souls are not going to die because the Dead lived not for a thousand years they're covered down in that 50 yea fifth dimension right gotta come up in the body that they send in and their soul and then then now we see the battle to meet the Battle of Gog and Magog is that final battle where God's fire killed all souls but ecomony can kill Saul he kills all the demons and all the souls of the people you say well they're going to listen if you're a sinner you're dead I don't care if you're walking around like I said before the scripture she that walketh in in other words in sin he's dead while she live so i senators day he convicted already and he's going to his judgement and he said what God going to kill the soul eventually well I mean they may burn for it for a thousand million years but one day that soul of that person will just go back you're not hard to think that you got all these people the Bill Gates and I know I'm just bringing out names of people did not saying he's not converted I'm just saying you take somebody there's like I said it's had everything multi be and they are just been able to give his hope you know he gives more than most people he gives more than week than when people making an eternity he'll have time to you know the right but that's going to be a knock and then one day if he's not the converted Christian one day his name's never going to be mentioning him and his whole psyche is whole self was gonna dispatch to gone lots off to me that that scares me more actually there would be really that but with eternal life we know that that's continuing on so we take two we take the glory in that the less finish means everybody all right yeah for what if some did not believe where their unbelievable know the fidelity by no means policy but let God be true though every man be false even it has been written that thou mayst be justified in thy words and may it's overcome in die judgment but if our unrighteousness establishes God's righteousness what shall we say is that God stunt is that God than righteous is that guy sorry is that God unrighteous Flynn Flynn rat I speak the court in the man by no means otherwise how will God judge the world for if the truth of God percent but the reason I'm here for the for if the truth of God bounded by my falsehood to this glory why am i also yet judged epicenter and not as we have been thoughtfully accused like I said husband do something so that's our problem see the problem people at church you'll have a good week and you'll and you know everything you distill you have a bad week and they don't show up or you know little for three or four times you don't say I want to play I love my brother Brown said he'd stay cloudy day don't mean God's not with you but a sunny don't they don't mean it with you either alright that's why we're Christians to overcome these things and have a balance cuz so if you don't you like this now if when we overcome read that sermon how can we overcome but Ramsey you got that what it's got to be the evil deal well I'm circumcised even if you're circumcised when I hired you gonna throw you just gotta those who endure to the end that's all I gotta say I love that those who to endure to the end shall be safe okay to me that discovers the whole bottle those who endure to the end God knew if you were going to endure you know what he won't give you the Newport if he knows you're gonna really goof up somewhere hey tonight you understand didn't deny the whole thing he knows that remember he sees the end from the beginning that's why he can if you go by predestination of that way then you know that is the way you win but that's the way you win not the way that God made you go so what you win because being all this you're free more than watch this keeps going on down let's read now verse 9 and finish what then are we better than they know and no I swear we have proof before proof both Jew and Gentile that they are all understand as it is written there is none righteous no not one let's read what the Greek says about this even as it has been written there is none righteous not even one all right there is none that understands there is none that sees God they are all gone out of the way they are together become all together they become what not profitable there's nothing good one boy now he gets now what Paul is doing Paul's fixin to talk to the people that's been talking about him all human but God's using this for us a man but why Paul is fixin to tell you where this is coming from their throat is an open Sepulchre with their tongues they have used this eat the poison of ASPs is under their lips buddy he's hitting somebody pretty hard whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness and I see that's not only that's not a Christian thank you all right their feet are Swift to shed blood destruction and misery are in their legs nobody is really laying down and the way of peace have they not known in other words what's he's saying the people that are talking about him are not Horning in okay they have no Christianity in them at all they have went back to their well I'm circumcised and you're uncircumcised oh well how I do and yura and I go to the temple and you don't go to the temple and there's no fear of God before their eyes now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them that are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God and that's what the law did and what a long does the law makes you guilty yeah okay I like the analogy somebody used a long time of going on I've tried to use it myself somebody was complaining and this was not a Christian person that they were changing the law that the the DUI law was now going to be point six instead of point eight you know you blow them the breath of a lot of tail meaning that you couldn't drink two beers and drive now you can't drink one beer drive so they were just complaining I mean I have a bottle bottle while I said you know what I said they can put at this point over one because I don't drink so that law has become non effect yeah it is a law on the book but has become not effective to me because I don't drink and if I never drink what's so funny right anyway the point the point is the law is not effective to me if I don't break it don't it you don't have to be on the book that's why they've brother Brown said you you know and like brother Bell says it'd be good to have warning and Christians in an inner part of your work aspect we still have problems that still you could get away you can do away with the DUI law that's why that when we get to glory there's not gonna be these laws that follow us why you don't need but now they do now some need it because some are going to be guilty before God that's why I'm telling you once we realize what we have in the new birth we're guiltless we're guiltless folks there is no law that covers menu except what we do in the extra right the internal man can be improved on because he is the eternal gunner he is the one that wrote the law put people under the law but came under the law so he can get us out from under the law okay so listen there's no law in the Bible that that's gonna that's going to that you're gonna worry about writing in your soul God can't go against God no I said Saul I didn't say the spirit realm we still got that guy to deal with now that's fair round guy we have to deal with because verse 20 therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified because what's going to happen is they're going to justified in each side for by the law is the knowledge of sin that's the same way with you and I let's read verse 20 in the original she would snitch therefore by works of the law no human being shall be justified in his presence for three law there is an acknowledgment of sin now look but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law he had come to love Jesus Christ had to come through the law and the prophets go see that's a then we'll get into the but we will for just a minute there's a paradox and don't get me wrong I mean this way of saying you and I don't need the old testament to live life we have to have the Old Testament to live by we're still under the law but now don't get me wrong don't start tearing the old text when I think I'm throwing it away because see you know what God knew we would say that so when Corinthians he wrote it all and said that what these were all given for example to whom the ends of the world have come alone so he knew I stand here and say this today when he wrote that that we do have to keep them both because man the Old Testament is perfect touch of God's grace and God's bringing in the Gentiles and all those thing but you got to remember the Jews have lived by the Torah and the prophets for now 2,000 over 6,000 years from Moses till now same book the cheat when it's done they denied them aside and you're waiting on them to show up and only 144,000 are going to realize that and you know what they're going to do they're going to say and living in the Old Testament now we have this new Testament and they're going to go testify to the ones that are still living under the law and that's what's going to give them that's what's going to give them good that's just what I believe I don't I don't believe they will be killed by the United States government no Philippine government Roman government you know I don't think there's people inside their own place we're going to get for turning against those hey if they killed Jesus one time they gonna kill them again but the 144,000 are going to be saved out of that they're going to want realize that they're having one of them all now because who's coming to them prophets do prophets that know the Old Testament Elijah and Moses the spirit of the two and it's going to be so evident in the two witnesses that the 144,000 is going to turn and say they have stepped run out the old customer they're doing this EXO CD to away the Old Testament they look back and say they're doing the same thing water turn the blood fire coming down from heaven stopping the rain these are characteristics that we see but know what they're going to do is to stay okay that's fine but there's a righteous missing gun that that law won't touch let me tell you about Jesus Christ and now probably say oh yeah we heard about him he's a good man no they're going to say then this is the reason we're standing here is that he went to a group of Gentiles and you see all that chaos going on in America you see all the things that were happening over there y'all around the world it's because there was a group left and now God it's dealing with you and that's going to bring the other boy I'll come under the law and bring them right into even the righteousness of God which is by what faith of Jesus Christ now faith in Jesus Christ that's the faith of Jesus Christ now see if you have the new part do you have the faith because hey you can have faith in Jesus Christ to be off right your faith not yes faith your faith so there's a lot of people sitting on pieces like one you know when your brother Graham say you ask too drunk on the street if you believe in Jesus and probably say his name 30 40 times here today but not calling on it but by faith of Jesus Christ and boy I like that because that has the whatever Jesus's faith was it's come to me and you see that's where we get the same thing about the new birth please whatever desperate brother there with your Ayers and Dohrn answer whatever belief that Christ had that he could walk on the water that he could change them he could feed 5,000 he could change certain things raise the dead heal the sick that was the faith of Jesus Christ and now that faith of Jesus Christ is not in Jesus Christ anymore I mean it comes from me but he said and I'm gonna give it to you I will be with you even in you you see what we got it's what we've already got nice comment bubble agharti God when we come into the into the new birth even the righteousness of God which is by faith of G back box re by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference now watch I like this scripture you say oh man it condemns me well it need me to but it shows me where I have to start for all have sinned so just throw everybody in throw everybody in the hell you know their own personal hello everybody in now and then God's going to watch save them out so I held a man one time I said he said well I got saved I said when you get se from connector I said save means that somebody throw you in the water if you can't swim and you were drowning and somebody reads down and picked you up and puts you in the boat and saved you from what you were doing to me nice a nice example this former salvation you can see if somebody saved you from what you were doing now what happens is is we have the ability to jump back into water if we don't get the new birth that's exactly what happened god let's do deals in the water yeah okay so that's the saving grace of Jesus Christ someone there's a lot of people going to be safe but there's no a lot of people going to get any birth right like I was telling you Sunday there's a big difference one on a big difference there's a difference in eternal life a new you birthed and you've heard there's something so special so special that only a small group of people is going to get it and the reason they got it if they believe and know about Hamelin I said I don't have a handle it but we come up to the day now we got to know how to handle cuz your power without character satanic we've seen it happen thousands of time for all that standing come short of the glory of God amen well I believe that 100% you leave you get you out though he's Eugene yellow water being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus so he brought back all sin come sort of learning time think I don't know but being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus look whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness book his righteousness omission of sins that are past I read this before remember this is under justification when we did the seal when we talked about justification we read next victor up there remember brother brown saved I did give you just maybe for justification chopped off your past sins and then they were remembered anymore remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of done you know why Paul said that because there's something that's going to keep piling to stand up there something that's not there going to go on to sanctification they're going to go on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and never thought to eat their past is nothing to be brought up again right to declare I say it this time his righteousness to Apollo has none that he may be just and the justifier we read the scripture people of him which believeth in Jesus guess what I'm telling you if you listen to these seals that were brand ever scripture you read is going to touch something that we're talking about because if it's the plan of redemption if it's the total plan of redemption the only way you're going to be redeemed is by what I'm reading and by what you read them in that's the only way you don't get retain comes Redemption perpetuation who fades in this blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time of his righteousness but now remember it's his rocks isn't right but hold on then it were in Aaron's and join Adams you gotta take that and put it right inside here that's right [Applause] cuz it in myself I'm not Roger but that thing that's inside of me is you just I start believing that that thing inside of you is just as righteous and God it's not just as righteous as God it is done that's why I say this father's name means more to me than ever you've got a father that you're supposed to walk like and he's giving you all the provisions that mom gave us all the provisions we need it we boost up bad most of all right but now the heavenly father won't he won't call you one dance that can't make them around work you don't tell you one basket now I'm gonna be gone I can't get to you no he's not that way 26 to declare I say at this time of his righteousness they might be just and the justifier who is the justified he is but he's justifying that him is us the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus so never word him he justified it where is boasting them it is excluded by the what law of works nay but by the law of faith we do them under that law we live under a law faith therefore we conclude no what look from right here at the worst one Paul is going to conclude therefore we can conclude another once you do bringing us somebody bringing it to this point right here that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law [Applause] [Music] I'll just put up [Applause] [Music] that's right that's right we'll see that faith of Jesus Christ that we read is right here we conclude let's see what that were directing me okay we got a little few minutes I love this app a lot of words won't work okay it mange [Music] [Applause] go down here to reckon to count compute calculate count over to take into account all right notion of all what you know about well to take you to count all this I'm saying taking all this into account we're going to conclude are some eyes or have a summation that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law so he's doing away because right hand look is he the god of the cube that woman is he the god of the Jew only is he not of the Gentile yes of the Gentile also let's finish reading we'll get it done seeing it as one God hallelujah we shall justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith because the uncircumcision has the law that they live a heathen so through faith they got it see it now the ones that are justified by circumcision by faith they're already in ones that are in the ones around all gonna be my faith they faint do we then make void the law through faith here we go now Paul can we take the whole Old Testament throw it away god forbid we establish the law you are the only ones that can live the law because there is a law there is a DUI law but the unwritten law is that you can drive all the time you want to right you just can't pass this right here if you start drinking then if you drink and drive this law I'm sorry this law takes over this law the law says you can drive you drive from when you're 16 years old you can drive there is your law but there are laws on top of that law that says if you drink if you run a red line if you speed if you do this if you reckless driving you see what I'm saying so we need to live under a law that says we can drive we live under a law we establish the law that the law and the letter is something for us to read take into account but we live by the faith of Jesus Christ I like this book of Romans I'm down yeah I really enjoy [Music]
