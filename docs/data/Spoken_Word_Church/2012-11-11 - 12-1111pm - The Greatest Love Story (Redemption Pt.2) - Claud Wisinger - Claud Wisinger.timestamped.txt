[8:24] Samuel's been preaching it but do you
[8:26] know in chapter 4 of Revelation brother
[8:28] R said that's the rehearsal of the
[8:30] Rapture do you know you have actually
[8:32] seen him the one there was an Open Door
[8:35] in heaven right there was an or Open
[8:38] Door in Revelation 3:8 too and brother
[8:41] Ram said that open door was you know in
[8:43] the the hour of sanctification there was
[8:45] a door at the end of that was open to
[8:47] where if they' have walked through the
[8:48] door they'd have walked into the baptism
[8:50] of the Holy Ghost right exactly but the
[8:52] one that was open in heaven if you look
[8:54] at what it's a revelation and brother
[8:56] brandham said the Rapture is what
[8:59] reation so chapter 4 we're looking
[9:01] through that door we know the door the
[9:03] sheepfolds Jesus Christ what do you see
[9:05] what's the first thing you see one
[9:07] sitting on the throne right I'm going to
[9:09] tell you something if you're going to be
[9:10] a part of the Rapture you're going to
[9:11] see what John saw amen is that do you
[9:14] agree with that you're going to see one
[9:16] sitting on the throne right you're going
[9:17] to see those four beasts and they got
[9:20] six wings is that
[9:21] right and I'm going to say something in
[9:23] a minute kind to blow your mind on that
[9:25] I don't know if you I talked to brother
[9:26] Wade about it and I kind of I kind of
[9:28] knocked his sock off on it today but
[9:30] brother Ram did say it and I want to
[9:32] explain something to here in a minute
[9:33] can I do that not while you're standing
[9:35] but I want to say something and you go
[9:37] read the quote I told Brother uh I I got
[9:39] it marked I just didn't print it off but
[9:41] I have a quote I want to read it to you
[9:43] it's a pretty awesome awesome quote
[9:45] let's go to Deuteronomy 7:7 if you would
[9:48] please and I going to uh this is what my
[9:51] plan is I'm going to talk to you about
[9:53] those four beasts a little bit I think
[9:55] it'll give you a little better
[9:56] understanding or more understanding not
[9:58] that I know it all don't I'm going to
[10:00] say what brother brandom said okay and
[10:02] if I don't say what he says then he's
[10:03] going to correct me when I leave or
[10:05] before but he'll correct it okay cuz I
[10:08] have confidence say he's the he's the
[10:10] man here I'm not the main man I'm just
[10:12] visiting this is your Shepherd you
[10:14] understand and he this man I promise you
[10:17] will lead you through cuz God gave him a
[10:19] Ministry spirit and that's his job and
[10:22] he's going to do his job okay I just
[10:24] want you to know that I have confidence
[10:26] in this man great you know what
[10:27] confidence is what I told you love yes
[10:29] if I love this man if you love your
[10:32] pastor you have confidence in him if you
[10:34] don't have confidence in this man you do
[10:35] not love him right okay okay Deuteronomy
[10:39] 7:7 the Lord did not set his love upon
[10:42] you nor choose you because you were more
[10:45] in number than any people for ye were
[10:48] the fewest of all
[10:49] right but because the Lord loved you
[10:53] amen don't you love that oh this
[10:56] Redemptive story just makes my heart
[10:58] melt he loves you and because he would
[11:01] keep the oath which he had sworn unto
[11:03] your fathers ha the Lord brought you out
[11:06] with a mighty hand and redeemed you out
[11:11] of the house of bond men from the hand
[11:13] of pharaoh king of Egypt right that's
[11:16] what God's done for you and the reason
[11:18] he did it is because he loved
[11:21] you he loved you and it what no greater
[11:25] love has a man for a friend than to lay
[11:28] down his life
[11:29] he proved it at Mount Calvary you want
[11:32] to proof of his love go look at Calvary
[11:34] he loved you cuz you're his friend
[11:36] remember Ruth means friend you're that
[11:39] little Ruth okay let's bow our heads
[11:42] dear heavenly father we thank you for
[11:43] this service and the people that are
[11:44] gathered we pray that you'll give us
[11:46] understanding give us a revelation of
[11:48] your word there's no such prevailing
[11:51] power as a revelation from you father
[11:53] and Lord I I don't have the English
[11:56] words there's nothing I can do Lord to
[12:00] express my love deservedly to you Lord
[12:03] but as a man and and as women here we're
[12:05] going to do the best we can brother
[12:07] ramam said all you can expect of
[12:09] somebody is their best and this church
[12:11] this people we're going to give it our
[12:13] best is what we're going to do Lord be
[12:15] with us in this service in Jesus
[12:17] Christ's name we ask it amen you may be
[12:20] seated let me get back to R what I did
[12:23] in our church I like I told you these
[12:25] three parts I showed you this morning
[12:27] what I did was I preached on revelation
[12:29] of church ages and I did a series on it
[12:32] then I went to Daniel 70 weeks and did a
[12:34] series on it then I went back to
[12:35] Revelations CH 4 and 5 cuz brother
[12:38] brandham I don't know if and you
[12:40] understand it I'm going to tell you what
[12:41] he said brother brandham said that
[12:42] chapter 4 was a rehearsal of the Rapture
[12:45] right does anybody know what a rehearsal
[12:48] is a rehearsal is something you do over
[12:51] and over right and over again that's
[12:54] right and you have a a a undress
[12:57] rehearsal but you res if you're uh who
[13:00] are you Romeo we sister Peggy he is
[13:03] Romeo by the way yeah okay Romeo you're
[13:07] going to we're having this rehearsal
[13:09] you're going to do the part Romeo Romeo
[13:11] Romeo until you get it down pack right
[13:14] right then what you're going to do
[13:16] you're going to have a dress
[13:17] rehearsal a little rehearsal and then
[13:21] you're going to do the performance is
[13:23] that right it's going to happen do you
[13:25] understand so chapter 4 is the rehearsal
[13:28] of the r Rapture is that what he said
[13:31] the example he used go read the book he
[13:32] said and I said ceil my wife chewed me
[13:35] out Cil be the meal my wife is a word
[13:38] Smith okay so I went to church and I
[13:41] said Cecil she said it's cesil I said it
[13:45] spelled Cecil she said it's cesil be de
[13:48] Mills so when I preached it that morning
[13:51] she jumped all over me like a good wife
[13:52] would normally does and so I came back I
[13:55] said I went I said cesil be theill okay
[13:59] so anyway he did the Ten Commandments
[14:01] right well he had Oral Roberts there
[14:04] right and what were they going to be
[14:06] critics right they were going to take a
[14:07] look at it and say did this meet you now
[14:09] one critic they didn't have there I was
[14:11] upset about was William brandom right
[14:13] right brother Bram said he could be a
[14:14] good critic did you know he said that
[14:16] but see they wouldn't put Brad the
[14:17] brandom there they had all the others
[14:18] there right that's how they thought a
[14:20] year profit but anyway he said it was
[14:22] the rehearsal you agree with that and
[14:24] what it was the rehearsal when you when
[14:26] a door was open a revelation has been
[14:29] come open in this hour and we saw one
[14:31] that sat on the throne we' seen the
[14:33] emerald color around him we' seen the
[14:35] four beasts does everybody agree with
[14:37] that right now this is something I'm
[14:38] going to say I want you to go take a
[14:40] look and and I told Brother Wade that
[14:42] morning CU I knew he had preached this
[14:44] and I so I'm not trying to I'm not
[14:46] trying to make a trouble you know but
[14:49] the four beasts there had six
[14:51] wings does everybody agree with that
[14:54] they had six wings the four beasts in
[14:57] chapter 5 did not have six
[14:59] weeks remember in chapter 4 it's the
[15:02] Rapture in chapter 5 it's the Plan of
[15:05] Redemption exactly now it said they when
[15:08] you go look at and I'm going to read it
[15:09] here in a minute and I'll stop and tell
[15:10] you this is what I'm talking about it
[15:12] said there were four beasts and 4 and 20
[15:14] Elders right it said they fell down and
[15:16] sung the song of redemption Angels can't
[15:19] sing the song of redemption is that what
[15:20] your Prophet said a seraphim cannot sing
[15:23] the song of redemption is that what it
[15:25] says a cherubim cannot sing the song of
[15:28] redemption right they have not a part of
[15:31] redemption if they sung the song of
[15:33] redemption they'd be Liars now we got
[15:35] Liars in heaven if that happened right
[15:38] so I'm going to tell you something in in
[15:40] Revelation chapter 4 brother brandom
[15:42] said it if you go read further down
[15:44] where it says the four he said they were
[15:46] not men or they weren't Angels they were
[15:48] not redeemed men now that's what he said
[15:52] he said I want to tell you more about
[15:53] those living creatures and this is
[15:55] chapter four so don't get that mixed up
[15:57] with chapter five right okay cuz one is
[16:00] speaking of the r where you see him
[16:02] sitting on high does everybody
[16:04] understand that Isaiah seeing him uh
[16:06] Ezekiel seening and they talked about
[16:09] wings right well that's what the high
[16:11] and mighty lifted up holy holy holy he's
[16:14] the one that said they seen those Wing
[16:16] creatures do you agree right but the
[16:18] brother said they're not Angels they're
[16:20] not redeemed men and brother BR said
[16:23] that in Revelations 4 of the book so I'm
[16:26] not guessing about what he said but then
[16:28] when I was looking at it when I preached
[16:30] chapter 4 I seen that and then when I
[16:32] preached five it said they fell down and
[16:34] worshiped them I thought now wait a
[16:35] minute that's a different four beasts so
[16:38] if you look and you follow the four
[16:39] beasts out brother Bram said there were
[16:41] four living creatures in the Old
[16:44] Testament right remember the 12 tribes
[16:46] how they camped around the ark the each
[16:49] the head of each one of those tribes or
[16:52] not the head of each but there were four
[16:54] and there were three there the eldest of
[16:57] that one he had an ins sign right and
[16:59] the inside was what it was a lion an ox
[17:03] a man's face and an eagle does everybody
[17:06] understand that they were the four
[17:08] living creatures that protected the ark
[17:10] if you were somebody an enemy that
[17:12] wanted to come and get the ark you're
[17:14] going to go through one of them and they
[17:16] had eyes behind and before so if I'm
[17:21] John not John that's that's your new let
[17:24] me see I know I'm at home I don't have
[17:25] it now but the inside if you're going to
[17:28] get by that flying eagle the one on the
[17:30] other side's going to see you coming so
[17:32] they had eyes before and eyes after you
[17:34] that right so brother and said the Old
[17:37] Testament he said that was the 12 tribes
[17:40] everybody agree with that and that's
[17:42] what the in the New Testament he said it
[17:44] was Matthew Mark Luke and John exactly
[17:46] they protected the books of Acts you
[17:49] couldn't get to the ark if you didn't if
[17:52] you didn't come through them and they
[17:54] all agreed Matthew does not disagree
[17:57] with acts right Mark doesn't disagree
[18:00] with Matthew they're all saying the same
[18:03] thing were they not right every one of
[18:05] them were saying the same thing so to
[18:07] get to the book of Acts you got to come
[18:09] through one of them right now go look at
[18:12] it and when you're talking about the
[18:13] Plan of Redemption everything in that
[18:16] chapter speaks of redemption right
[18:19] everything right I know I kind of got
[18:21] you miffed here a little bit don't I and
[18:23] I'm going to prove it to you in a minute
[18:24] it'll blow you away a little bit but so
[18:26] that that's in there those that Beast
[18:29] represented look the 12 Elders right it
[18:33] it the anointing in the church ages does
[18:36] everybody understand the anointing of
[18:37] the church ages what were they lion Ox
[18:41] you know what an ox is a converted bull
[18:43] got the fight taken out of him where's
[18:46] Zach at you know what an ox is don't you
[18:49] Zach they get the fight taken out of
[18:52] them those people those 68 million had
[18:55] to fight taken out of them they didn't
[18:57] resist them they went right to right to
[19:00] get burned at the steak you know brother
[19:02] R said they had it easy we have it hard
[19:04] kind blows your way don't it all they
[19:06] had to do is okay they and
[19:08] feathered and lit the match done what we
[19:11] do is year after year we're fighting the
[19:13] devil year after year we're fight day
[19:15] after day like I said this 200,000,000
[19:17] demons you're fighting and wrestling
[19:19] with them every day that's right they
[19:21] had it easy you have it hard right but
[19:24] God could trust you God has confidence
[19:26] in you in this church okay you want hear
[19:29] me say that over and over God has
[19:31] confidence in each and every one of you
[19:32] here that you're going to be an
[19:33] overcomer or he wouldn't have put you
[19:36] here God didn't put you here to be a
[19:38] loser God put everyone in this church
[19:41] here to be a winner you understand you
[19:44] are a winner that's what I want get
[19:47] positive okay so we understand that in
[19:50] the book of chapter five which five is
[19:53] Grace by the way you agree with that he
[19:55] put it he put it per the most Sublime is
[19:58] that what he said right he put it right
[20:00] there those four
[20:02] beasts okay are talking about the
[20:04] Redeemed yeah and I tell you that it
[20:07] doesn't look at it it doesn't say Angels
[20:09] there it does or it doesn't say Wings
[20:11] there right it says four living
[20:13] creatures right now I want you to I know
[20:16] that and that's maybe a little different
[20:17] than you've ever heard it I'm not trying
[20:18] to be different I'm just trying to be
[20:20] honest with you okay so go take a look
[20:23] at it and you'll see that in that fifth
[20:25] one it speaks of redemption now I want
[20:27] to read chapter 5 and all the way
[20:29] through it if I can okay uh hold on then
[20:32] we're going to go through Ruth and I'm
[20:34] going to
[20:37] hurry I hate to keep people long I
[20:39] really do I used to sit out there like
[20:41] you did I did it for 21 years under a
[20:43] good preacher and now I'm the guy up
[20:46] here holding them too long okay let's go
[20:48] to Revelation 51 and I saw on the right
[20:51] of hand of him that sat on the throne a
[20:53] book right written within and on the
[20:55] backside that's what I tried to tell you
[20:57] give you the real what Redemption is
[20:59] it's on the the back side of the book
[21:01] there were seven seals put can I say
[21:03] this on the Book of Revelation yeah and
[21:06] the seals were also within the book on
[21:08] the inside of it right all the way from
[21:11] Genesis all the way through what was hid
[21:13] from the people was Redemption yeah they
[21:16] never totally fully understood it and
[21:19] one place brother Ram said this is the
[21:20] fullness of redemption right is that
[21:23] right what is it it's the full
[21:24] Revelation right cuz remember it's a
[21:26] door open do you agree with that in chap
[21:28] 4 so right now right here in this church
[21:31] you're starting to understand the
[21:34] fullness of redemption right amen right
[21:36] you got to get the Revelation first and
[21:38] then you're going to get the
[21:38] manifestation right right so this is
[21:41] what it's talking about we're going to
[21:43] go through chapter 5 okay I lose my
[21:45] place
[21:47] already and follow me I want you to
[21:49] follow me cuz sometimes I'll say okay
[21:50] where was I at at our church I my mind
[21:52] just races you know you know how that is
[21:54] don't he's laughing he knows what I'm
[21:56] talking about you're preaching you're
[21:57] going at warp speed yeah you'll never
[21:59] understand what it's like unless you've

[22:20] okay and I saw a strong Angel Proclaim
[22:23] with loud voice who is worthy to open
[22:24] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[22:27] and no man in heaven nor in Earth
[22:29] neither under the Earth was able to open
[22:31] the book neither look therein and I wept
[22:34] much right not because his name wasn't
[22:36] on the book like people say or he seen
[22:39] his name on the book no he was weeping
[22:42] because there was no man worthy to open
[22:43] the book that's what he was weeping
[22:46] about because no here it says it no
[22:49] because no man was found worthy to open
[22:51] and to read the book neither look there
[22:52] on and one of the elders saith unto me
[22:55] weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[22:57] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[23:00] Prevail means overcome exactly you're
[23:03] Overcomers cuz he overcame Amen in every

[23:10] seven plans of redemption there was
[23:13] there was every age there was an
[23:15] overcomer okay so he has prevailed do
[23:18] you agree to open the book and to loose
[23:20] the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld in
[23:22] low in the midst of the throne and of
[23:24] the four beasts and in the midst of the
[23:25] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[23:28] L having seven horns and seven eyes

[23:33] seven spirits of God see those seven
[23:36] spirits of God have to do with
[23:38] Redemption amen right he said seven PL

[26:13] said this man's a
[26:15] messenger right yeah people may argue
[26:19] that point but it's just flat to truth

[26:23] the Beast and the elders and the number
[26:25] of them was 10,000 time 10,000 that

[26:34] included in that 12 Elders the 12 tribes

[31:13] now remember give me the slide on Ruth
[31:15] where I said the four Junctions brother
[31:17] bam called it right brother
[31:22] Joseph remember brother brandham said
[31:24] there were four Junctions in the Book of
[31:26] Ruth right there there was Ruth deciding
[31:29] that's justification there was Ruth
[31:32] serving that's sanctification there was
[31:35] Ruth resting which is the baptism of the
[31:38] Holy Ghost he'll give you rest for your
[31:40] souls does everybody agree with that so
[31:43] the third part of that is the baptism
[31:45] Holy Ghost the fourth part is rewarding
[31:47] sure that's the fullness of redemption
[31:50] do you agree so Boaz went and did the
[31:53] fullness of redemption is that right
[31:55] remember the name Boaz means to Quicken
[31:57] it mhm yeah see look you could read the
[32:00] you could read Revelation 5 the rest of
[32:02] your life if God don't Quicken it you're
[32:04] not going to get the fullness of it
[32:06] you're not going to get the complete
[32:07] revelation of it in this hour we have
[32:09] received the full revelation of chapter
[32:11] 5 amen the mystery of God is finished
[32:14] right so our Prophet has brought us a
[32:17] revelation of chapter 5 that's the
[32:19] fullness of it and we go we can go all
[32:22] the way to new Heaven and new earth we
[32:24] know what it's going to be amen you
[32:26] understand the new Heaven and new earth
[32:27] I do the Revelation has been given to us
[32:30] you understand but God has to Quicken it
[32:33] this man can't Quicken it God has to
[32:36] Quicken it has everybody got that right
[32:38] now I'm going to tell you something I
[32:39] tell our church you know sister back
[32:42] down there told me something but listen
[32:44] to what I'm telling you science says the
[32:46] average human has to hear something 14
[32:48] times to comprehend it right did you
[32:50] know that right I told the church this
[32:52] so if I repeat myself don't blame me cuz
[32:55] some of you out there aren't average
[32:59] yeah yeah so you caught it I hear you
[33:03] laughing I said if I speak at 28 times
[33:06] it's not my fault it's yours because you
[33:09] know what me and him are going to sing
[33:11] them over again to me wonderful words of
[33:15] life and we're going to keep singing
[33:17] this song of redemption we're going to
[33:19] keep sing it's a new song to me right
[33:21] it's a new book to me ain't that what he
[33:23] said and when I I seen the whole book
[33:25] I've started singing the song of
[33:26] redemption and I can't stop
[33:28] nobody can stop me I'm going to sing
[33:30] this song of redemption is that right
[33:32] and I'm going to sing it over and over
[33:35] and over until you start singing it
[33:38] amen right that's right is that
[33:40] fair that's what I'm going to do if it
[33:43] takes 28 times okay let's be there 28
[33:45] times that's why I just preached this I
[33:48] was in part eight when I
[33:49] left right what am I doing I'm singing
[33:52] it over and over until they start
[33:54] singing it with me I'll start seeing
[33:56] everybody's face go
[33:59] do you know when you catch a revelation
[34:01] you'll
[34:02] grin your face will testify of it when I
[34:06] look out there and I say something
[34:07] there's one sister in the church and I
[34:09] pick on her all the time she loves me
[34:10] and I love her she's just awesome and
[34:12] she'll sit out there she she'll
[34:15] go and I'll walk down the stairs I'll go
[34:18] over to her I said did you get that she
[34:21] go yeah I knew it I didn't have to ask I
[34:24] said okay let me say it again and so
[34:26] I'll rephrase it or say it again I said
[34:28] you get that she'll
[34:30] go honestly her face goes
[34:34] from your body responds to things folks
[34:37] that's what I'm saying if your body
[34:38] can't respond to
[34:40] Redemption there's something wrong
[34:42] exactly I seriously there's something
[34:44] wrong if you can't put flesh and I said
[34:47] it earlier I'm going to say it again you
[34:48] can't put Flesh on this Redemption story
[34:51] something right you're not getting it
[34:54] does everybody understand you're just
[34:57] not getting it right and I think that's
[35:00] why we see people in the messy churches
[35:02] so down and out you know they'll come to
[35:05] or sickly we're
[35:07] wiers you know that let me tell you what
[35:10] juwel says Wy Wy me has he ever said

[35:23] you don't believe me let me read it okay
[35:25] where did I stop at I didn't I didn't
[35:27] start did I now it came to pass in the
[35:29] days when the judges ruled that there
[35:31] was a famine in the land famine in
[35:33] Israel and a certain man of Bethlehem
[35:36] Judah went to soldier in the country of
[35:38] Moab he and his wife and his two sons

[36:40] Boaz redeemed Naomi she redeemed brought
[36:44] men and his name up in Israel right amen
[36:47] He restored their name I don't care if

[36:54] bother Boaz Boaz in the end of this
[36:57] thing is going to raise you
[36:59] up that is a type of
[37:02] redemption everybody you know healing is
[37:04] a type of redemption it's bringing your
[37:06] body back to what it's supposed to be
[37:08] right see that's what it's talking about
[37:11] when it's talking about poor M and
[37:12] Chilean Chilean M yeah it was Chilean
[37:15] wasn't it yeah m m and Chile they were
[37:18] sick and and

[37:58] over me just a minute I'd almost like to
[38:01] shout I'd speak in tongues if it
[38:02] wouldn't interfere with
[38:06] things ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah
[38:09] and they came into the country of Moab
[38:11] and continued there and liik Naomi's
[38:13] husband died and she was left and her
[38:15] two sons and they took them wives of the
[38:18] women of Moab the name of one was orpa
[38:21] and the name of the other Ruth and they
[38:23] dwelt there about 10
[38:25] years they had no children
[38:28] they didn't did they I mean they married
[38:30] Ruth and they married orpa but now they
[38:32] would have been married two years a half
[38:33] year before they died all I know is imik
[38:37] and Naomi was down there 10 years okay
[38:39] they married the two girls the two boys
[38:41] and they the the daddy and the boys died
[38:44] right and all that was left to her was

[38:54] um and Ma and chillian died also both of
[38:57] them and the woman was left of her two
[38:59] sons and her husband then she arose with
[39:01] her daughters-in-law that she might

[39:06] had heard what is justification
[39:10] right hearing the word right you know
[39:14] what she was down there in that Mobi
[39:16] land and she heard that the famine was
[39:18] over in Israel Faith cometh by hearing

[39:50] the Lord had visited the people in
[39:52] giving them
[39:53] bread he gave it to them everything you
[39:56] got in this life is what God gave you
[39:59] you don't think so he gave you his son
[40:01] he gave you the five-fold ministry he
[40:04] gave you the Holy Ghost right what did
[40:07] he not give you brother it's what he
[40:09] gave you it's not it's unconditional
[40:11] it's not what you done it's what it's
[40:13] not what Abraham done it's what God did
[40:14] from Abraham and we're the faith seat of
[40:16] Abraham it's what God gave you you you
[40:20] you God gave you that right right boy
[40:24] you are loving more after thisall
[40:28] wherefore she went forth out of the
[40:29] place where she was with her two
[40:31] daughters-in-law with her and they went
[40:33] on her way to return unto the land of
[40:35] Juda where did I get did I turn
[40:38] two yep hold on and theom send her two
[40:41] daughters-in-law go return each to her
[40:43] mother's house the Lord deal kindly with
[40:46] you as ye have dealt with the dead and
[40:48] with me remember justification everybody
[40:52] said what are you doing you know what my
[40:55] family said about me is just another
[40:58] phase he's going through cuz I was I
[41:01] went through a lot of phases trust me
[41:02] and they were right they were what they
[41:04] said was right I am going through a
[41:06] phase but this is not going to end I'm
[41:09] not coming out of this phase that's what
[41:11] they don't understand I Cann not go
[41:14] back right does everybody understand
[41:17] Ruth was a moabit does everybody
[41:19] understand Ruth had the wrong birth
[41:21] right do you everybody understand the
[41:23] moabites were born out of incest their
[41:25] birth was not right that's why Israel
[41:27] did not like the moabites right they
[41:31] hated them cuz why they didn't have the
[41:33] right birth so here you have Ruth that
[41:36] doesn't have the right
[41:38] birth Naomi heard and Ruth stayed true
[41:42] to Naomi now let me show there's quote
[41:44] and I don't if I read it I'm not going
[41:45] to get through with this and you know it
[41:48] but brother random said Naomi was the
[41:50] type of the old Covenant right Ruth was
[41:52] the type of the New Covenant now let me
[41:54] you know that's a good say let me break
[41:56] it down you Old
[41:58] Testament Ruth had to stay true to the
[42:00] Old Testament sure you know the number
[42:02] one thing the people in my church come
[42:04] to me they say people out there in the
[42:06] world will tell me that's the Old
[42:08] Testament you don't have to pay
[42:09] attention to that Ruth stayed true to
[42:13] the Old Testament do you realize you're
[42:15] Ruth and you're going to stay true to
[42:17] the Old
[42:18] Testament we are the only Ruth is the
[42:21] only one that's going to stay true to
[42:23] the Old Testament does everybody agree
[42:25] with that somebody told me that
[42:27] downstairs and I said I was going to get
[42:28] on it whoever you are I don't see you I
[42:30] know you're here but he said look in
[42:33] Deuteronomy 22:5 when it tells you women
[42:35] not to wear that pertaining to a man are
[42:37] you going to stay true to the Old
[42:38] Testament are you going to stay with
[42:41] Naomi I say they will if you're Ruth you
[42:44] will you ain't going to put on clothes
[42:46] that pertaineth to a man because if you
[42:48] do you're not staying true to Naomi the
[42:50] Old Testament that was the that was the
[42:54] justification that Ruth had was she was
[42:57] going to stay true to the Old Testament
[42:59] right she heard there was a f that the
[43:02] famine was over exactly she heard
[43:05] underneath Naomi Ruth heard that there
[43:07] was one
[43:08] God right here oh Israel the Lord thy
[43:11] God is where did you hear that from
[43:13] Naomi didn't you the Old Testament you
[43:16] that where it was are you staying true
[43:17] to it or did you hatch up three a
[43:21] trinity did you did anybody hatch that
[43:23] up if you do you're not Ruth right see
[43:26] that's why chapter 5 it said there was
[43:28] one that sat on the throne amen see and
[43:30] brother R said the perfect type of
[43:32] redemption is in Ruth so look does it
[43:35] show one God in Ruth does it show three
[43:37] sitting on the throne pretty simple
[43:40] isn't it so see Ruth absolutely is a
[43:43] perfect it shows you the Plan of
[43:44] Redemption perfectly amen that's what it
[43:47] does okay that's why the that's why the
[43:49] sages left it in now I don't think they
[43:52] even understood why right but they must
[43:54] have read it and been inspired and say
[43:56] no it's inspired how else could they got
[43:57] it God moved on them by the Holy Ghost
[44:00] to tell them to include it right but
[44:02] brother ra said it's a hidden Mystery
[44:04] and now what we're going to do tonight
[44:05] to this morning we're going to look at
[44:07] that hidden Mystery okay and we're going
[44:10] to see as we go through it we're going
[44:11] to see The Plan of Redemption right and
[44:13] this hour is the
[44:16] hour that the seals were loosed amen
[44:18] where now we can receive the fullness of
[44:21] the Plan of Redemption everybody got
[44:23] what I'm saying this is the hour you're
[44:25] in okay na only said un her two
[44:28] daughters-in-law go return each to your
[44:29] mother's house the Lord deal kindly with
[44:31] you as you have dealt with the dead and
[44:34] with me the Lord grant you that ye may
[44:37] find rest each of you in the house of
[44:39] her husband then she kissed them and
[44:41] they lifted up their voice and wept and
[44:43] they said unto her surely we will return
[44:46] with thee unto the Lord unto thy people
[44:48] and Naomi said turn again my daughters
[44:51] why will you go with me are there yet
[44:53] any more sons in my womb so see
[44:55] justification you remember when you're
[44:57] Justified you come to the altar you're
[44:58] all so happy the whole burden of the
[45:00] Earth's lifting up and all of a sudden
[45:01] it's like here the Devil comes right
[45:04] he's trying to make you go back he's
[45:06] going to make you go back go back right
[45:08] but there's something inside of you says
[45:09] I can't go back that's right I'm going
[45:12] to say something you're going to think
[45:13] this I'm weird I am I'll admit it if you
[45:15] say I'm weird okay I'm weird how what do
[45:18] you teach your children when they're
[45:20] growing up do you teach them how the
[45:22] seals open did you teach them about the
[45:24] coming of the Lord or did you teach them
[45:27] about Noah did you teach him about David
[45:29] and his little
[45:31] slang what were you treat what what did
[45:33] your kids when they it says teach them
[45:35] the way of the Lord and they'll not
[45:37] depart from it what what was the you see
[45:39] this the tipes you taught them all that
[45:41] right you did that sister Peggy didn't
[45:43] you you told them about Moses you told
[45:45] them about the burning bush right and
[45:48] your kids wouldn't part from it why they
[45:50] were little Ruth is what they were right
[45:53] the people that part from that so you
[45:55] teach your children the old Testament
[45:57] cuz why it's it's just little simple
[45:59] little don't you do that Dianna she can
[46:02] probably tell you about David in's
[46:03] little sing she can tell you about the
[46:05] ark and all the giraffes and all the
[46:07] things that went on the ark and you know
[46:10] what you teach these little kids these
[46:11] things you're teaching of the Old
[46:13] Testament and when they get older right
[46:17] now they don't have the birth everybody
[46:19] see where I'm going with it they don't
[46:21] have the new birth right but you know
[46:23] what they say I'm going to stay with
[46:26] that I kind of like that that and you
[46:28] know what old brother Samuel sometimes
[46:29] he talks about the type of the of that
[46:32] Ark how it was justification
[46:33] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost right
[46:37] see it's all in there Redemption folks
[46:39] it's all in the Bible and so what they
[46:41] do is they say you have stayed true to
[46:44] the Old Testament right so your little
[46:46] kids you teach them that and they stay
[46:48] true to it and that what brings them on
[46:50] in to follow all the way to Boaz you
[46:54] understand what I'm saying and that's
[46:56] what God did he brought all those little
[46:59] you think they're little stories and
[47:00] they're big stories yeah but what is it
[47:02] it's preparing you and you hear them and
[47:05] somebody says oh you believe that story
[47:08] of Jonas in the whale yeah why that
[47:11] whale's mouth ain't that big how can he
[47:14] swallow
[47:15] Jonah well you know he said he was a
[47:18] prepared fish is what mama told me what
[47:20] you told me it was a great they call it
[47:23] a whale but it was a great fish that's
[47:25] right you told them the old test and
[47:27] they'll stay true to it why did we stay
[47:29] true to the Old Testament where
[47:31] Ruth and she says let your God be my God
[47:35] let your people be my people let your
[47:38] city be my city now to Israel what was
[47:41] their City Jerusalem what's our city New
[47:44] Jerusalem same city you understand what
[47:46] I'm saying right so in in Ruth it's
[47:49] showing us justification is you're going
[47:51] to stay true you've decided you made up
[47:54] your mind you're going to follow this
[47:55] thing right and you you start out you're
[47:58] going to and you're going to stick with
[47:59] Naomi no matter what that's why when
[48:01] people out in the workplace they're
[48:02] trying to get you away from the law do
[48:04] you understand in Simplicity they say oh
[48:06] that's in the law I don't have to do
[48:07] that you sisters are staying true to
[48:10] Naomi when you sisters don't wear them
[48:13] pants and you men don't wear dresses I
[48:15] tell you we'll grip about a women wear
[48:17] pants but it says a woman man ain't
[48:18] supposed to wear that a man ain't
[48:20] supposed to wear that you would you

[48:39] a laugh cuz I won't do it okay this guy
[48:42] is going to stra stay true to noomi you
[48:44] get my point right and and it just
[48:46] that's a little bitty simple thing but
[48:48] it's not simple we're finding out it's
[48:50] big so we're going to stay true to Naomi
[48:53] right everybody's going to stay true to
[48:55] Naomi please raise your hand
[48:57] amen me too all them little stories I
[49:00] want to stay true to them cuz they're

[49:53] against me and they lifted up their
[49:55] voice and wept again and orpa kissed her
[49:58] mother-in-law but Ruth caved unto her
[50:01] yeah one of them forsook the Old
[50:03] Testament yeah you understand what I'm
[50:06] saying they'll say oh the law don't
[50:07] matter that's what orpa did now I don't
[50:09] believe orpa went back down to mobat and
[50:11] was a bum I think she prospered no right
[50:14] I do I really think she went down there
[50:16] and prospered you know what I mean I
[50:18] really do knew but Ruth clave unto
[50:22] her stayed right next to her you that's
[50:25] what clave is right
[50:27] you're going to stay real close to the
[50:28] Old Testament you understand you're not
[50:30] going to leave that you're not because
[50:33] why Noom me told you these little
[50:35] stories and you believed it is that
[50:37] right right the Old Testament told you
[50:39] these stories and you're going to cleave
[50:40] to that that's what you're going to do
[50:42] so see it's the law has a whole new
[50:45] meaning to me you know what I mean I'm
[50:47] going to cleave to it and she said
[50:49] behold thy sister-in-law has gone back
[50:50] on her people and her Gods her
[50:53] Gods you see what happened when you
[50:56] return back in the moabit land you
[50:58] return into your Gods so you don't stay
[51:00] true to the Old Testament here o Israel
[51:02] the Lord thy God is one okay this is
[51:05] what I'm talking to you chapter one's
[51:06] about justification right if you're
[51:08] Justified you're going to leave them
[51:09] other gods
[51:10] right if you're Justified you're going
[51:12] to leave those Gods okay return Thou
[51:15] after thy sister-in-law and Ruth said
[51:17] treat me not to leave thee or to return
[51:19] from following after thee for whether
[51:22] thou goest I will go and where thou
[51:25] lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be
[51:29] my people and thy
[51:30] God see how it's different
[51:33] between orpa right and Ruth exactly
[51:38] we're going to St your God will be my
[51:40] God it's Jehovah the Old Testament Jesus
[51:43] Christ the new your God will be my God
[51:47] glory right absolutely okay where thou

[51:54] buried right the Lord do so to me and
[51:57] more also if ought but death part thee
[52:00] in me when she saw remember she said if
[52:03] I part from you the only thing I want is
[52:06] for death to let us part but I'm going
[52:08] to cleave to you and nothing's going to
[52:10] separate us did you know that nothing
[52:14] I'm going to be H nothing's going to
[52:15] separate me from the Old Testament I
[52:17] believe it's real I believe those
[52:20] Shadows of that Old Testament by the
[52:22] opening of the seals by the seals on the
[52:26] backside
[52:27] and within of being opened up where Ruth
[52:29] become a new book to me right Genesis
[52:31] become a new book to me Exodus become a
[52:34] new book to me and I'm want to clave
[52:36] under that I'm want to clave under that
[52:38] Old Testament
[52:41] right I am I'm not going to leave it
[52:44] right sure when she saw that she was
[52:47] steadfastly minded that means she ain't
[52:49] going to change her mind Ruth was not
[52:52] going to change her mind I am not going
[52:54] to forsake the Old Testament has
[52:56] everybody got that how many in here let
[52:58] me see your hand see if I'm hitting on
[53:00] this how many in your hands work and
[53:02] they say that's the Old Testament and
[53:04] they want you to leave it how many come
[53:06] on raise your hands haven't you been
[53:07] told that some of you were shaking your
[53:10] head they'll say what do you mean that's
[53:12] the Old Testament see what they're
[53:14] wanting you to do and if you do forsake
[53:16] it it's proof you're you're orpa right
[53:18] and not Ruth do you see what I'm saying
[53:21] by you staying true to the Old Testament
[53:23] it shows you are absolutely showing them
[53:26] you're a Ruth and now when they say that
[53:29] do you know what you need to tell I'm
[53:30] Ruth and I'm going to stay with Naomi
[53:33] now they may not understand the type but
[53:34] that's what you're going to do right
[53:36] right that's your justification staying
[53:38] true you
[53:40] understand when she saw that she was
[53:42] steadfastly minded to go with her then
[53:44] she left speaking unto her so they went
[53:47] though so they two went until they came
[53:49] to Bethlehem and it came to pass when
[53:52] they were Come to Bethlehem that all the
[53:55] city was moved about them
[53:57] yeah did you know brother brandham said
[53:59] this and you said you say yes brother

[54:40] chapter is justification but when you
[54:43] have true justification you're glorified

[58:21] everything under him fell which was the
[58:23] birds the bees the Earth and that's why
[58:26] everything that fail is going to be

[58:54] awesome isn't it 12 2 so Naomi returned
[58:57] in Ruth of moabitas her daughter-in-law
[59:00] with her which returned out of the
[59:01] country of Moab and they came to
[59:03] Bethlehem in the beginning of the barley
[59:06] Harvest yeah right yes exactly that's
[59:11] right in the beginning of the barley
[59:14] Harvest you know what the seven Church
[59:16] ages the first church age was the
[59:17] beginning of the barley Harvest do you
[59:20] agree yeah because the barley Harvest

[59:24] from the beginning to the end now the
[59:26] church age is 77777 7 * 7 is
[59:30] 49 right so when did Ruth come into the
[59:34] field right when did the Gentile Ruth
[59:37] come into the field right the beginning
[59:39] of the church ages does everybody see
[59:41] what I'm saying amen now she's going to
[59:43] have to serve and work in that field
[59:45] sure right through the church ages but
[59:48] she's going to come to full Redemption
[59:50] one day Boaz is going to Quicken her
[59:53] remember I told you this morning Boaz
[59:55] means quick his name means quick so what
[59:59] is Boaz he's a type of Christ he's going
[1:00:01] to Quicken you but you know what at the
[1:00:04] end of the church ages is when this is
[1:00:06] what has he done he's quickened us
[1:00:08] Revelation 5 to a lot of people it's a
[1:00:11] dead letter but it's not to me right
[1:00:13] Revelation 5 I don't know about you guys
[1:00:15] but it's been Quicken to me Glory it's
[1:00:17] lifegiving to me it means everything to
[1:00:20] me chapter 5 cuz it's the Plan of
[1:00:23] Redemption everybody got what I'm saying
[1:00:25] okay
[1:00:27] beginning of the barley har and Naomi
[1:00:28] had a Kinsman of her husband a mighty
[1:00:30] man of wealth of the family of almic and
[1:00:32] his name was Boaz and Ruth of Mo said un
[1:00:35] her let me now go to the field and glean
[1:00:38] ears of corn after him that's talking
[1:00:40] about God not
[1:00:42] Boaz I'm going later on I'm going to
[1:00:44] explain to you and show you how it
[1:00:45] happened okay I'm going to show you it's
[1:00:47] really it's really a beautiful thing
[1:00:50] right in whose sight I have found Grace
[1:00:53] and she said unto her go my daughter and
[1:00:55] she went went and came and gleaned in
[1:00:57] the field after the Reapers does
[1:00:59] everybody know in the chap in what is it
[1:01:01] Matthew 13 the Reapers does everybody
[1:01:03] know who the reapers are you want me to
[1:01:05] tell you who the reapers are Paul right
[1:01:08] irenius right Martin lumbo Luther I
[1:01:12] might have got him out of order there
[1:01:14] Wesley and brother brandham right now
[1:01:17] look you're going to go into a field and
[1:01:19] you're going to stay behind the rapers
[1:01:22] you're the final voice of the final age
[1:01:23] under your messenger you can't get ahead
[1:01:26] of the reaper you can't get ahead of
[1:01:28] brother brandham right some of these
[1:01:30] preachers in the message think they got
[1:01:31] something smart brother brandham was
[1:01:33] wrong and their
[1:01:35] writer the whole thing Ruth is you're
[1:01:38] supposed to stay behind the Reapers
[1:01:40] right you understand that you know what
[1:01:43] I'm going to stay behind Paul am I I
[1:01:46] believe brother R preach what Paul
[1:01:47] preach you you want me to further
[1:01:49] expound on that I believe brother
[1:01:51] Brandon preached what irenius did I
[1:01:53] believe what brother Brandon preached
[1:01:54] what Columbo did I believe ROM preach
[1:01:56] what the other one believed right
[1:01:58] because you know what he said look we
[1:02:01] have what they had plus right so if
[1:02:04] brother brandham if we're not saying
[1:02:06] what irenia said we're in deep trouble
[1:02:09] folks because brother brandham said what
[1:02:11] irenius said right now let me tell you
[1:02:13] I'm going to give you some light on it
[1:02:15] irenius had some he had the truth but
[1:02:17] there was some mystery left off from
[1:02:19] it you agree remember brother Bram said
[1:02:23] the story of Ruth had some hidden
[1:02:26] mysteries in it yeah right and it had to
[1:02:30] be quickened it wasn't enough
[1:02:32] justification sister that don't Quicken
[1:02:35] you you understand what I'm saying I
[1:02:37] know that sounds funny don't it but you

[1:32:38] see faith f final resting places in the
[1:32:40] word that little Kentucky fellow with
[1:32:42] the Kentucky language was quoting
[1:32:44] scripture and paraphrasing it in
[1:32:46] Kentucky ease I was telling him last
[1:32:48] night in the car Jesus said in Nicodemus
[1:32:50] 3 thou you must be born again do you
[1:32:54] agree where'd he get it that's right
[1:32:57] Ezekiel 36 yeah he said he'd give you a
[1:33:01] new heart right or he give you a new
[1:33:03] spirit right and put my spirit in your
[1:33:05] heart that's the new birth everybody
[1:33:09] understand Jesus paraphrased Ezekiel but
[1:33:12] those noad priests well you're not
[1:33:15] saying what brother random
[1:33:17] said I mean you if you don't quote a
[1:33:19] quote with some message verbatim oh my
[1:33:21] you're not sa they don't have enough
[1:33:23] Holy Ghost to understand you're keeping
[1:33:25] the continuity of the message does
[1:33:28] everybody understand that's what's
[1:33:29] happening around the message oh you got
[1:33:31] to quote it verbatim Jesus didn't quote
[1:33:33] the scripture verbatim and you know what
[1:33:36] the scribes are going you know what
[1:33:38] Nicodemus now he was a teacher he was a
[1:33:41] rabbi he was a big dog around there yeah
[1:33:44] he said can I crawl back in my mother's
[1:33:46] wom he said and you're a teacher in
[1:33:50] Israel
[1:33:51] right right you know y to say and you're
[1:33:54] a preacher in a message would it be fair
[1:33:58] would it be much different if I said
[1:34:01] that what you don't know these things
[1:34:04] you being a preacher of the message if I
[1:34:06] put some oky bonics art do you get
[1:34:08] confused with
[1:34:10] me and this guy like I said he talks in
[1:34:14] he's a Georgia guy you know what I mean
[1:34:16] I understand him he understands my OK
[1:34:19] bonings yeah now I may not be quoting
[1:34:21] the quotes at verba but he's got enough
[1:34:24] Holy Ghost to know I'm right and I got
[1:34:27] enough Holy Ghost to know he's right
[1:34:29] right what's wrong with some of the
[1:34:31] others I'm not saying we're I'm not
[1:34:32] saying we're the only two right there's
[1:34:34] a lot of them out there right but
[1:34:36] there's a lot of them out there

[1:34:40] so be honest with
[1:34:42] you okay where did I end somebody tell
[1:34:45] me thank you and Ruth of Moab said he
[1:34:48] said unto me also Thou shalt keep fast
[1:34:50] by my young men till they have ended all

[1:34:54] daughter-in-law it is good my daughter
[1:34:56] that thou go out with his maidens that
[1:34:59] they meet thee not in any other field
[1:35:01] see there's other churches right sure
[1:35:05] you're not the only one that's right
[1:35:07] there's some other maidens in MO in Boaz
[1:35:09] field right there's other young men out
[1:35:12] there there's other preachers so you're
[1:35:13] not the only one I'm not the only one
[1:35:15] right exactly that's what I'm
[1:35:17] saying she so she kept fast by the
[1:35:20] maidens of Boaz to glean into the end of
[1:35:22] barley Harvest and of the weed heart and
[1:35:24] dwelt with her mother-in-law huh dwelt
[1:35:27] with her mother-in-law she kept with the
[1:35:28] Old
[1:35:29] Testament right she dwelt that's pretty
[1:35:31] close isn't it she dwelt with her okay
[1:35:35] and Naomi her mother-in-law said unto
[1:35:36] her my daughter shall I not seek rest
[1:35:38] for thee that it may be well with thee
[1:35:41] and now is not Boaz of our Kindred with
[1:35:44] whose maidens thou was behold he went
[1:35:47] with barley tonight in the threshing
[1:35:49] floor do you know what Naomi was telling
[1:35:53] Ruth yeah about the kinsman
[1:35:56] redeemer yeah Ruth or Naomi the Old
[1:36:00] Testament has explained us what the
[1:36:03] kinsman redeemer is right did everybody
[1:36:05] get that right Naomi all of a sudden
[1:36:08] says
[1:36:09] oh he's a Kinsman she knew the law of
[1:36:14] kinsman redeemer right she knew the law
[1:36:17] the Old Testament right the Old
[1:36:18] Testament started telling Ruth he's a
[1:36:21] near Kinsman he can redeem me and in
[1:36:24] redeeming me he's going to redeem you
[1:36:26] mhm you understand yeah when Jesus died
[1:36:29] on the cross did he redeem Israel did he
[1:36:32] redeem you he paid the price of
[1:36:35] redemption right so you see you got to
[1:36:39] stay with Naomi if if you do away with
[1:36:42] the Old Testament how are you going to
[1:36:43] understand Kinsman how you going to know
[1:36:45] these you can't right you can't that's
[1:36:48] why people people out there in the world
[1:36:49] all the time they tell me oh that's the
[1:36:51] Old Testament
[1:36:54] they just want to throw it away but see
[1:36:56] they're identifying who they are that's
[1:36:58] bottom line right when somebody wants to
[1:37:00] get rid of the Old Testament even in
[1:37:01] this church if they'll say a that's the
[1:37:04] Old Testament you know did Brother ROM
[1:37:06] say that on tape huh brother ROM said
[1:37:10] you got to God don't change his mind
[1:37:12] about his word if you read it in the Old
[1:37:14] Testament it's not dead letter it's
[1:37:16] still it's God Amen do what it says
[1:37:19] serve in his field right stay as close
[1:37:22] to Naomi as you can right right these
[1:37:25] people driv me crazy out here

[1:37:53] from
[1:37:56] truth he was
[1:37:58] winnowing he was taking the falsehood
[1:38:01] and the truth and separating them well
[1:38:04] that's what he's doing he's separating
[1:38:06] the true from the false yeah does
[1:38:08] anybody and I'm going to have to take
[1:38:09] time here I'm boy I apologize guys I
[1:38:11] hate taking this much time but this is
[1:38:13] just a to me it's a greatest story in
[1:38:14] the Bible look this is what happened
[1:38:17] when they wied when they went they went
[1:38:19] up on a mountain and they had a
[1:38:21] threshing floor everybody heard of that
[1:38:23] fling floor was a circle that had a door
[1:38:25] in it and what they would do they'd get
[1:38:27] in it with pitchforks they would throw
[1:38:30] it up and the heavy stuff the wheat
[1:38:32] would fall back down into the threshing
[1:38:33] floor the lighter chaff dirt would blow
[1:38:38] off the mountain does everybody
[1:38:40] understand that so God's going to take
[1:38:42] you up hither he's going to give you a
[1:38:44] revelation and that Revelation is heavy
[1:38:47] and you're going to fall back down in
[1:38:48] the threshing floor everybody got what
[1:38:50] I'm saying we're speaking of redemption
[1:38:52] you're heavy wheat's heavy because why
[1:38:54] you got a revelation Chap's like they
[1:38:57] don't have a revelation they're going to
[1:38:59] blow off some Doctrine two Lords is
[1:39:01] going to come along blow him right
[1:39:03] out it's going to happen now what we see
[1:39:06] happening right so that's what's
[1:39:08] happening he he was Boaz was up there
[1:39:10] doing that Boaz was doing that right now
[1:39:14] let me let me I don't know if I get it
[1:39:16] now let me do it right
[1:39:18] now does everybody understand a thief
[1:39:22] have you ever seen a thief work for
[1:39:24] something before he stole
[1:39:27] it no a thief a thief don't want to work
[1:39:30] that's why he's a
[1:39:32] thief if you steal from Brothers you're
[1:39:34] a thief you don't want to work for it
[1:39:36] shame on you this is what would happen
[1:39:38] in the days of Boaz when they were
[1:39:40] winnowing it they' go down and sleep in
[1:39:43] that door because look if I was a thief
[1:39:45] sister Peggy what you think I'm going to
[1:39:47] go out and reap that and work out in the
[1:39:50] field to get it I'm a thief I'm lazy
[1:39:53] that's why I'm a thief so what they do
[1:39:55] they throw it up and they got it down
[1:39:56] here all that Boaz lay down in the door
[1:39:59] that night remember he does that I'm
[1:40:02] coming to that he was winnowing barley
[1:40:04] does everybody understand that he was
[1:40:05] separating the false from the true and
[1:40:08] he lays down in front of it he's the
[1:40:10] door of the Sheepfold and he's not going
[1:40:12] to let something come in and steal you
[1:40:13] out of there because you're heavy with
[1:40:15] Revelation you understand see they want
[1:40:17] to come in Devil Wants you cuz you're
[1:40:19] heavy with Revelation but he can't get

[1:40:24] laid there and he wasn't going to let
[1:40:26] the devil come in that thief and steal

[1:40:33] Revelation right you're going to be in
[1:40:34] the threshing floor and Boaz is going to
