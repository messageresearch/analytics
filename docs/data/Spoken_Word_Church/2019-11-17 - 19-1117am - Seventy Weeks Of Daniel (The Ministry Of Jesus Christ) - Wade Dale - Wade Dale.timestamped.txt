[32:52] power we have the ability to do that
[32:55] here we have the ability to take care of
[32:58] things and this little bracelet is just
[32:59] a reminder that I'm heading towards 60
[33:02] years old and they some things in my

[33:36] so for you got your Bibles or pull the
[33:38] screen up we'll go to the last part of
[33:41] this is going to be I told you we've
[33:43] been through the 70 weeks of Daniel and
[33:45] for those of you that that have not been
[33:47] here then just just to endure it for a
[33:49] little while or go back and watch and
[33:50] listen or or just pray that God would
[33:53] give you spiritual insight cuz I can't
[33:57] give you a revelation anyway guess the
[33:59] only God can do it okay and I want to
[34:02] give you one more little one more little
[34:04] tidbit of notes when I get finished with
[34:06] this series I've been something came to
[34:11] me the other day remember what brother
[34:13] Dale has been preaching on he said
[34:14] sometimes you know a preacher will get
[34:15] up and steal start preaching and he'll
[34:16] be preaching something all of a sudden
[34:17] God will take you off into another
[34:19] direction another thought brother Harris
[34:22] was preaching mold man long time ago and
[34:25] I was having problems with
[34:26] predestination a little bit so I was
[34:29] sitting right there and buddy he was
[34:30] preaching away had nothing to do didn't
[34:32] even read a scripture that had
[34:33] predestination in it but God opened
[34:36] predestination just like I opened the
[34:38] book and just handed it to me just like
[34:40] this and it just kept unfolding so you
[34:43] know God can do that but uh I've been
[34:44] thinking on as I was sitting here the
[34:47] other day listening to to brother Dale
[34:50] in the word revival came into my heart
[34:53] and the word word revival came into my
[34:59] heart so I have been if you want to look
[35:01] them up yourself there's twenty five
[35:03] hundred and seventy one quotes in the
[35:06] message I'm on quote 2000 I've been
[35:10] reading them all so we're gonna see if
[35:14] we can start and it starts with the
[35:19] people brother Graham said even a
[35:21] preacher can't start a revival it has to
[35:23] be started by God but it has to be
[35:24] started by the people want one alright
[35:26] so we will cover now we'll start a
[35:28] series on the word revival so just keep
[35:31] that in your heart but today if you'll
[35:32] look we've been speaking on Daniel
[35:35] seventy weeks giving you the dates
[35:37] giving you the times and the things
[35:38] going from the Gentiles to the Jews to
[35:41] the Gentiles in fact
[35:42] the Jews and then into the millennium
[35:44] and we'll get to that in just a minute
[35:45] but if you're seeing what my topic is
[35:47] today the Ministry of Jesus Christ all
[35:50] right so I want you to make sure that
[35:52] you remember that is the most important
[35:54] part of Daniel seventy weeks is to
[35:56] remember that without the Ministry of
[35:59] Jesus Christ there is nothing that
[36:02] three-and-a-half-year message of Jesus
[36:04] Christ has lasted us over 2,000 years
[36:09] three and a half years - three and a
[36:13] half years has left us 2,000 years and
[36:16] then brother Branham comes along God
[36:18] since it's a prophet and he preaches
[36:19] eleven hundred and something sermons
[36:21] I've out of those three and a half years
[36:23] sermons so it's a very important thing
[36:25] so I want us to look now and focus on
[36:27] the Ministry of Jesus Christ because
[36:29] it's all the Ministry of Jesus Christ
[36:30] but a lot of it is you know seventy
[36:32] weeks and all these things but we'll
[36:34] read it where they build the city we'll
[36:36] see that has nothing to do with us but
[36:39] it has part to do with Daniel seventy
[36:41] weeks because it comes to the series and
[36:42] through the scripture so let's let's bow
[36:45] our heads before we get started
[36:46] dear lord thank you for this day that
[36:49] you give us it truly is a time of
[36:51] Thanksgiving that we thank you Lord for
[36:54] all the things we look in this world and
[36:57] we see people that are just going
[37:00] through life with with nothing just an
[37:04] empty vessel walking through life and
[37:06] father don't let that happen to us Lord
[37:10] even the prophet of God told us even
[37:11] Christians can become dark in certain
[37:14] places because they don't use the gift
[37:16] that God give them Lord we pray that you
[37:19] would break that forth today that you
[37:22] would be Lord the one that is the active
[37:25] participant in the service as always
[37:26] you'd be the one that does the speaking
[37:29] you'd be the one that does the revealing
[37:30] father we pray for the sick that you'll
[37:33] heal them father that you'll be with the
[37:35] sister of their Lord in in South
[37:38] Carolina that you'll just release that
[37:41] demon of cancer from her body in the
[37:45] name of the Lord Jesus Christ all these
[37:47] things are done and the Bride of Christ
[37:49] says amen Daniel 9:24 seventy weeks are
[37:53] determined upon by people and the holy
[37:56] city
[37:56] there's two things to do six things to
[37:59] finish the transgression to make an end
[38:01] of sins to make reconciliation for
[38:03] iniquity to bring an everlasting
[38:05] righteousness seal up the vision and
[38:07] prophecy and to anoint the most holy now
[38:09] see the three-and-a-half-year message of
[38:11] Jesus Christ is what does those six
[38:12] things without that we have no
[38:15] redemption without that we have no
[38:16] salvation without that we have no
[38:19] reconciling and end of sins yet there's
[38:22] no end of sin without the Ministry of
[38:24] Jesus Christ none zero all right
[38:26] know therefore and understand that from
[38:28] the going forth of the commandment to
[38:29] restore and build Jerusalem but to the
[38:31] Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks
[38:32] and threescore in two weeks the street
[38:35] shall be built again in the wall even in
[38:37] troublous times and after threescore and
[38:38] two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but
[38:41] not for himself and the people of the
[38:43] prince that shall come shall destroy the
[38:45] city in the sanctuary we know that Titus
[38:47] and the end therefore shall be with a
[38:49] flood and to the end of the war
[38:50] desolations are determined and he shall
[38:53] confirm the covenant with many for one
[38:55] week and in the midst of the week he
[38:56] shall cause the sacrifice and the
[38:58] oblation to cease and for the
[39:00] overspreading of abominations he shall
[39:01] make it desolate even unto the
[39:03] consummation and that determined shall
[39:05] be poured upon the desolate you may be
[39:07] seated in the Lord at his blessing to
[39:09] the reading of the word I'm gonna
[39:10] they're gonna bring one up on the board
[39:15] not yet but I just want to went back to
[39:19] the to the skeleton drawing here so
[39:21] we'll start with that in just a little
[39:22] while we don't have any second service
[39:27] I've got a full bottle of water we'll be
[39:29] here a while at least it's not to bottle
[39:32] setting up here you know what happened
[39:36] when I was at a church and they gave me
[39:39] two bottles kind of scary huh alright so
[39:44] here we go
[39:45] let's read quote number one just for a
[39:46] little bit of background we're gonna fly
[39:48] through this pretty quick because we've
[39:50] been on this series for those G's not
[39:52] being here we've been on this series for
[39:53] several months and bring up quote number
[39:57] one the six fold purpose
[40:06] okay now I want you to know friends
[40:08] they're striking on these things I'm
[40:09] certainly leaving out weeks of teaching
[40:11] but just kind of hitting it so when the
[40:13] weather cools or later when we get into
[40:15] the seventh seal seven vials seven
[40:16] trumpets and all these things I can
[40:18] refer back and we're going to refer back
[40:20] to this because what today is today
[40:22] we're going to cover and go through what
[40:23] we've been preaching them and then the
[40:26] last six or seven quotes that we're
[40:28] going to bring are going to seem totally
[40:30] contrary to what we've been preaching
[40:32] but listen remember one thing brother
[40:38] Branham was a word prophet he was not a
[40:41] false prophet it had to fit it has to
[40:44] fit in the word the word doesn't fit his
[40:47] message his message fits the word and
[40:50] face final resting places where in the
[40:53] Word of God all right so we're not we're
[40:55] not doing away with the word we're not
[40:57] doing away your brother Browns message
[40:59] we're trying to bring this clarity to
[41:02] the message that we've been through for
[41:04] all this period of time 50 something
[41:06] years since the prophets left and try to
[41:09] help you - I always if you have a
[41:15] question about something that you're
[41:17] kind of a little fearful you have a
[41:19] little fear when you have a question
[41:20] about something you know you use
[41:22] something because when you ask you a
[41:23] question you're not getting the answer
[41:25] or you don't have the answer so there's
[41:26] that little dark spot in there you know
[41:29] but now I believe that God brought us
[41:32] all this light and here we are covering
[41:35] it all by God no lights light brother
[41:38] Branham was the prophet in the end time
[41:40] he was the vindicated prophet he was the
[41:42] messenger to this hour
[41:44] he has been vindicated authenticated and
[41:48] his words right amen and it compares
[41:52] with the Bible every time so we're gonna
[41:56] read some quotes though that you're
[41:58] gonna say well why did he say that if he
[42:00] was a word prophet because this is what
[42:02] the Bible says well we'll let's just see
[42:06] everybody all right so let's read the
[42:09] red part in these seventy weeks of
[42:11] Daniel cover now what if you don't get
[42:15] this quote right you're gonna make him
[42:18] say so
[42:18] ladies not saying because what and these
[42:21] 70 weeks of Daniel covers from the going
[42:24] up of the church unto the coming back of
[42:26] the church now where do we go up we go
[42:31] up right here this is the church ages we
[42:33] go up right here and it covers until we
[42:35] come by well he's condensed it into that
[42:38] one week and these 70 weeks of Daniel
[42:43] covers from the going up of the church
[42:45] for the coming back of the church that
[42:47] space is when it covers now watch he
[42:48] says now not all seven two weeks and
[42:50] daniel part of it because you have all
[42:52] this part over here that you got to set
[42:53] up with thereby okay with that alright
[42:56] because you got one two three if I good
[43:03] with that we don't been through this so
[43:05] if you if you don't know what I'm
[43:07] talking about go back what's tape cuz
[43:08] you got one week nine or seven or you
[43:13] got a seven of what seven 62 and seven
[43:18] so that makes 69 and then 70 weeks
[43:25] equals 490 years because one week equals
[43:29] seven years seven times seven is what
[43:32] 490 there Bay got that same am right
[43:35] seventy weeks its 490 years
[43:39] well what 69 times seven its 483 years
[43:46] now that leaves seven years where's that
[43:49] out right here everybody got that
[43:51] cuz brother Brown we're going to read
[43:53] here in a minute where he says it's
[43:54] broken up into three periods one a seven
[43:57] week period where they build the temple
[43:58] a 62 week where Jesus comes on the scene
[44:01] and he starts history and a half your
[44:04] message right here because remember the
[44:07] church ages are here this is the seven
[44:11] church age Azure the Gentile AIDS or the
[44:14] engrafting of what the wild olive tree
[44:18] now God doesn't deal with Israel and us
[44:23] at the same time right cannot does not
[44:26] will not because he deals with us as
[44:30] individuals he deals with
[44:33] Israel as a nation jesus said I came to
[44:36] my own in my own receiving me not he
[44:38] came to all of Israel to save them right
[44:42] here but what did they do they turned
[44:45] him down they cut him off and then what
[44:49] he turned right straight to Gentile
[44:51] bride then now the Gentile bride is
[44:53] gonna take a rapture right here not too
[44:56] far from now nobody believes that nobody
[45:02] ain't Mandy I'm looking for a
[45:05] resurrection than a rapture I'm getting
[45:07] older door y'all hey man some of you
[45:12] real it'll be one so Gentiles going
[45:16] around her and then God what does he do
[45:18] he turns right back and starts dealing
[45:21] with the Jews again but now watch what
[45:23] he does I drew that room he deals with
[45:26] the Jews for three and a half years amen
[45:30] he dealt right here three and a half
[45:32] years Blue Devil
[45:36] where's that t-shirt at I hate these
[45:44] mechanical thing that's better
[45:48] how's that okay so he dealt with he come
[45:51] on the scene and preach three and a half
[45:53] years we proved that the other day right
[45:54] so he preached three and a half years
[45:57] here that was Jesus himself and then he
[46:01] comes back through two witnesses and
[46:03] preaches three and a half years right
[46:04] here according to revelations 11 will
[46:08] not read it will skip through it
[46:09] revelations 11 brings 1 in 11 1 brings
[46:13] two witnesses that prophesy twelve
[46:16] hundred and sixty days which is three
[46:19] and a half years not according to 365
[46:22] and a quarter days because that's our
[46:25] calendar that's because the world is
[46:27] wobbling it was tilted it Noah's age I
[46:31] just it was tilted in Noah's time
[46:34] because all the IceCaps and all the
[46:36] other things to come about and they ate
[46:39] the dates and the times and they're all
[46:41] the seasons and everything but now God's
[46:43] always dealt with 360 days
[46:46] because that's exactly 30 days to a
[46:48] month or as melchizedek comes to abraham
[46:55] and he says Abraham about the cycle or
[46:58] about the time of life Sarah's gonna
[47:00] have a baby so ladies you understand
[47:04] what I'm saying there's a 30-day cycle
[47:07] to nature and there's a 30-day cycle to
[47:09] you all right so that's how God deals
[47:11] with 360 days so 360 days at three and a
[47:14] half years is 1260 days so the Bible is
[47:17] correct but now remember he preached
[47:21] 1260 there were three and a half years
[47:23] over here that's Jesus's ministry now
[47:27] listen here's where we we may not we're
[47:32] just going a different way I guess then
[47:33] I thought we were going so anyway good
[47:36] to have Kendrick with us today I just
[47:45] saw him looking at me from the back of
[47:46] my head I felt it but we come here too
[47:50] and we look at today and we want to see
[47:52] the Ministry of Jesus Christ so what's
[47:53] the Ministry of Jesus Christ he preached
[47:55] physically preached three and a half
[47:57] years that's the first four books of the
[47:59] Bible first four books of the not the
[48:01] New Testament but the first books
[48:03] they're talking about what Jesus did
[48:05] while he was here
[48:08] then what happened he was cut off at
[48:10] Calvary and the Jews said let his blood
[48:13] be on us and our children so he quit
[48:15] dealing with the Jews he started dealing
[48:18] with a Gentile bride that's me and you
[48:20] know watch what how long did Jacob
[48:24] remember Jacob because remember one
[48:27] thing right here when Jesus came to
[48:29] earth he knew though that Israel was
[48:32] going to cut him off but he had to say I
[48:36] am coming he said don't even go to the
[48:38] Gentiles go to my people America that
[48:42] was his people now we know he went to
[48:44] jail we know he went to Gentile he was
[48:46] Almighty God but still the Bible says he
[48:48] came to his own and his own received him
[48:50] not so anyways so he came and preached
[48:53] three-and-a-half years to try to get
[48:55] Israel to see who he was now what's he
[48:59] gonna do right
[49:00] he's gonna come and preach through two
[49:02] prophets three-and-a-half years to get
[49:04] Israel to see who he is that all rights
[49:07] Amen alright so now what happened was
[49:11] what's this
[49:13] to make the continuity of the scripture
[49:15] go correct Jacob where we get over in
[49:18] Genesis I believe it is Genesis 29 we
[49:21] get where Jacob served seven years for
[49:26] Rachel and then seven for and he got
[49:30] Leah but any search seven years for
[49:33] Rachel and he got hurt nobody got that
[49:35] same in all right because in Genesis 29
[49:37] that's where brother Branham got we're
[49:38] one week equal seven years ago the Bible
[49:40] says he fulfilled her week all right so
[49:44] when he fulfilled her week now what did
[49:46] he fulfill our week he fulfilled our
[49:48] week right here through seven Church
[49:52] ages to get Rachel the young one but
[49:57] he's working what three and a half here
[49:59] and three and a half year he's working
[50:01] seven years to get Leah
[50:06] works out perfect leah was the older
[50:10] which is that type of Israel he worked
[50:13] seven years for her and then he worked
[50:14] seven years to get us so he's got to do
[50:16] when he redeems Israel is right here
[50:19] right Israel is potentially everybody's
[50:21] redeemed at Calvary okay but remember
[50:24] it's got to be applied
[50:25] it's got to be applied when it's applied
[50:28] is over here on this 1260 days that two
[50:32] prophets preached and like I told y'all
[50:34] before we had two great Gentile prophets
[50:36] we had Paul and brother Branham God sent
[50:40] us two great prophets one to begin it
[50:43] and one to end it because they got so
[50:46] many loose ends in here that's why I was
[50:48] talking we were talking about or I was
[50:50] talking me and God was talking to each
[50:52] other the other day about a word revival
[50:54] and that's what we were talking about
[50:55] you you can't have a word revival with
[50:58] loose ends you can have a partial
[51:00] revival or a Reformation but a
[51:04] Reformation is not a revival a revival
[51:06] is reviving what you already have enough
[51:08] you've got faults in you you can't
[51:10] revive that or you
[51:11] can revive that because the devil also
[51:14] has a revival whoa yeah every revival
[51:19] produces what twins all right so that's
[51:22] what happened here the revival produce
[51:24] twins and what happened in here it all
[51:27] got muddled up and Father Son Holy Ghost
[51:29] baptism but that wasn't true right here
[51:32] no they had two pure unadulterated word
[51:35] right here no denomination no other idea
[51:39] no three gods no Trinitarian no Father
[51:42] Son Holy Ghost baptism but what happened
[51:44] was that it got right in here but what
[51:47] happened at the end God sent a prophet
[51:49] to put all them loose ends back together
[51:52] to bring a word revival that would take
[51:55] us in a rapture I love that how that all
[52:01] works together it's just a beautiful
[52:02] picture once you see it how God has
[52:05] dealt with tried to deal with Israel
[52:09] because remember they rejected him but
[52:12] I'll promise you one thing he was the
[52:15] Messiah whether they said he was or not
[52:19] that was the Messiah message the Messiah
[52:23] message he was the Anointed Messiah he
[52:26] was Christ Jesus Christ and he preached
[52:30] three-and-a-half years whether they
[52:31] liked him or not doesn't matter he was
[52:34] who he was and he's into what they've
[52:37] done though what they done remember
[52:39] brother Branham comes right here and he
[52:41] said I indict this generation for the
[52:43] second crucifixion of Christ what they
[52:45] do they took that Christ and they put
[52:47] him back on the cross you look at people
[52:52] today my lord people that claim to be
[52:55] Christians today them they have no form
[52:59] of Christianity kurz like a sailor drink
[53:02] like a fish what is that
[53:11] that's unbelievable but there yeah
[53:15] you're right about that
[53:16] but you know what though they're blind
[53:18] you and I have not been blinded you and
[53:22] I have the full light today and that's
[53:25] what's gonna take us in a rapture cuz we
[53:27] didn't put him on a cross that wandered
[53:30] on the crowds on the crosses inside of
[53:32] me and you today we know exactly where
[53:35] he is all right I wasn't gonna do that
[53:38] make that look like that but guess what
[53:40] there anyway let's go to number two if
[53:42] you don't mind mm-hmm talking about the
[53:45] six fold purpose here quote number two
[53:49] keep going past that we already read
[53:52] that but we already quoted it now the
[53:54] six fold purpose we find out in the six
[53:56] full purpose to anoint the most holy
[53:57] we find out the most holy always
[53:59] represents the church the tabernacle and
[54:01] the last thing was to be done was to
[54:03] anoint the most holy that's the
[54:04] Millennial tabernacle that he'll live in
[54:07] during the millennium millennial that we
[54:09] live in so that's right here right this
[54:13] is a millennium
[54:16] nobody got that wit done through this
[54:19] chart ten times so pay attention number
[54:23] three the 70th week of Daniel watch this
[54:27] now let's outline Daniel seventy of
[54:29] weeks now I might repeat here again
[54:30] ministers of the gospel if you disagree
[54:32] which a lot of them didn't still do they
[54:34] are divided into three periods now watch
[54:35] how distinct it is three periods as we
[54:38] find out in Daniel 9 three pitch first a
[54:41] seven week period
[54:42] if I got that same am alright and to
[54:45] listen y'all can Amen and shout and
[54:48] praise God
[54:49] you ain't gotta save it for me this
[54:50] afternoon all you got to do is save me
[54:55] to eat let's see spiritual food first
[54:58] and then you can go eat natural food
[55:00] amen
[55:02] alright then a threescore into when I
[55:07] watched three scored three times twenty
[55:08] is sixty sixty two week period is number
[55:12] two and which is sixty two and then a
[55:16] one week period number three one week
[55:20] not not half week one week
[55:24] because you gotta add seven and
[55:25] sixty-two and 69 and one makes 70 that
[55:30] puts us right where we need to be
[55:32] now that's according to the Bible that
[55:35] cannot and will not change God's Word
[55:39] can change all right now number four
[55:44] number four quote is for brother Branham
[55:46] I don't want you to think I come up with
[55:48] it but brother Brown said look one week
[55:50] equals seven years so one week equals
[55:53] seven years then he talks about the
[55:54] blackboard he puts it up cuz he drew
[55:56] this pretty much the exact same chart
[55:58] and most of you have got that chart if
[56:00] you don't you can have one we've got
[56:02] plenty of them around here somewhere
[56:03] alright let's go to number five now
[56:08] we're told from the going forth of the
[56:09] commandment now here's where the trouble
[56:11] is told from the going forth of the
[56:13] commandment to rebuild the city to
[56:14] Messiah and Messiah was Christ shall be
[56:17] seven weeks and threescore and two weeks
[56:18] making sixty-nine weeks we already said
[56:20] that and seven times sixty-nine makes
[56:22] 483 years we already said that so we
[56:25] were just letting him verify that we've
[56:28] read this quote before now now you
[56:30] getting it down if you want me to run
[56:32] over it again I'll be glad to now we're
[56:33] told from the going forth of the
[56:35] commandment to rebuild the city to the
[56:36] Messiah shall be 7-7 that's first right
[56:39] here
[56:40] seven it took him 49 years to build that
[56:44] temple we prove that the other day all
[56:45] right with NEMA coming in with an edict
[56:49] to go forth and not just build the now I
[56:52] just build the temple but they had to
[56:53] build the walls and the sidewalks and
[56:56] the walls because a government is not a
[57:00] government without defense and a way to
[57:04] move transportation all right we don't
[57:06] have a wall in America but we have a
[57:09] defense system all right so that made
[57:11] civil government come back to Israel not
[57:13] that just that they built the temple and
[57:15] set it out in the middle of the in the
[57:16] middle of the desert no you can't do
[57:18] that the Bible says the walls will be
[57:20] built in trouble sometimes alright and
[57:23] seven weeks and threescore to make 62
[57:26] and seven and 69 69 weeks seven times 69
[57:29] makes 483 years that puts us right here
[57:32] all right
[57:34] the right therefore because when I read
[57:38] these other quotes you're gonna go
[57:40] really remember the Bible's right
[57:45] therefore and tell them a sign that were
[57:47] coming up to this part here he puts a
[57:51] cross right here and this is this is
[57:53] where Jesus started his ministry he was
[57:55] born four BC died in a t30 until the
[58:00] Mossad there's got to be 483 years
[58:01] everybody got that same man so that now
[58:04] that's 483 years no half years in there
[58:07] anywhere four years in 483 we've got to
[58:15] get to 490 so there's got to be one week
[58:18] are seven years because one week equals
[58:22] seven years all right left for the Jews
[58:26] now look here's what I want - we'll pull
[58:30] that chart up in a minute but remember
[58:34] one thing back to the ministry of Jesus
[58:35] Christ you can't have Redemption you
[58:39] can't have salvation without that
[58:42] Ministry of Jesus Christ can I have that
[58:44] alright that okay say Amen
[58:46] we gotta have the Ministry of Jesus
[58:48] Christ now what happens is we as
[58:51] Gentiles needed that back again we
[58:56] needed that ministry back again look the
[58:58] Ministry of William Branham coming up
[59:00] from 1962 to about 65 which is last
[59:03] about three and a half years that was
[59:04] his message not in the years of
[59:08] preparation sure he preached from 47 to
[59:10] 1965 but his message was to bring those
[59:15] seals Jesus's message was to bring the
[59:19] seals it was so covered till nobody knew
[59:23] anything about it but God sent us a
[59:25] prophet and he said in spoken word
[59:28] original seed he said as of yet Malachi
[59:30] 4 I said 1962 has not been fulfilled
[59:35] well he started in Malachi 4 we know
[59:37] that but the fulfillment of his message
[59:40] was that last three-and-a-half years
[59:43] when the seals broke all the way up to
[59:45] when God took him off the scene
[59:46] everybody got that
[59:47] which lasted about three and a half
[59:49] years and that had to come back because
[59:52] of the same ministry remember he always
[59:53] said he say this is the same Ministry of
[59:56] Jesus Christ on the earth with the signs
[59:59] with the wonders with the discernment
[1:00:01] with the things that that's coming and
[1:00:03] things that are now here that came right
[1:00:07] here to us to us
[1:00:10] we're recipients of that and then what
[1:00:13] the Jews are so blinded God still got
[1:00:15] his big hand over their eyes but when we
[1:00:18] leave because of because we remember
[1:00:21] Jesus preached and then he took a
[1:00:24] rapture guess what Jesus is gonna preach
[1:00:29] again he's gonna become so visible among
[1:00:31] us he'll raise the dead that's a quote
[1:00:33] by brother Branham and we'll go in the
[1:00:35] rapture who's going on the rapture wait
[1:00:37] Dale no Jesus Christ is going in the
[1:00:39] rapture I'm just part of him
[1:00:42] and I got to go with him amen because
[1:00:45] the ones that are part of the devil
[1:00:46] guess where they're gonna go they're
[1:00:47] gonna stay here all right because we're
[1:00:50] going to go in the rapture and then God
[1:00:51] promised one more time of 1260 days to
[1:00:57] redeem Israel but you got to bring in
[1:01:01] all the city and all those things also
[1:01:03] that's why there's got to be not just
[1:01:05] 1260 days but there's got to be seven
[1:01:09] years after the rapture of the church
[1:01:13] I'm going to read it to you now it's
[1:01:15] going to see him in a minute when I read
[1:01:17] these quotes to you that he contradicted
[1:01:19] himself but he did not remember he
[1:01:20] cannot contradict the Bible everybody
[1:01:25] got that
[1:01:26] all right so now let's go to number six
[1:01:34] and he even says he's draw it out here
[1:01:37] on the blackboard we've got the picture
[1:01:39] if anybody wants some of this is a
[1:01:40] certified verified by sister Rebecca
[1:01:43] Branham that this is what she took off
[1:01:45] of the book of blackboard and she made
[1:01:48] me grafted off this is actually in her
[1:01:50] one of the not the original but he came
[1:01:52] off the original brother George Smith
[1:01:54] have indicated it for us so we know for
[1:01:56] sure that that was on the tabernacle
[1:01:58] blackboard they didn't have these in
[1:02:00] 1960
[1:02:01] - they had blackboards kids y'all no
[1:02:06] wonder by morning
[1:02:08] it's Kauai taking the tablet and turning
[1:02:11] it off and writing on it cuz that's what
[1:02:14] y'all are dealing with in school y'all
[1:02:15] dealing with tablets now so turn the
[1:02:16] tablet off you've got a black screen
[1:02:18] don't do it cuz the teacher will kill
[1:02:20] you
[1:02:20] take some chop and start writing on it
[1:02:22] well that's what the blackboard was well
[1:02:23] this was on the blackboard at the
[1:02:25] tabernacle according to what brother
[1:02:28] Brown saying now what's he doing he's
[1:02:30] gonna put it up to explain that you
[1:02:32] might understand what I'm trying to
[1:02:34] speak up because remember we get a lot
[1:02:39] but not much from preaching and teaching
[1:02:42] and talking but when you can make it
[1:02:45] visual the percentage goes way up that
[1:02:50] you comprehend that in your head okay is
[1:02:53] that right that right says Tran okay all
[1:02:57] right look over to your sister and go
[1:03:02] she just did that she in said that was
[1:03:05] right but she looked over there but look
[1:03:07] now watch now he's explaining it this
[1:03:11] we've been over this I mean I don't know
[1:03:13] how many sermons we've been through this
[1:03:15] he did it in three sermons but there was
[1:03:17] a lottery left out but that's okay there
[1:03:19] was a lot for us to to get almost I've
[1:03:22] been since the end of the week I've been
[1:03:23] trying to find out what words to say for
[1:03:25] this it's got to compare with the rest
[1:03:27] of the Bible that's my whole quote this
[1:03:29] has got to compare this has got to
[1:03:31] compare with the rest of the Bible every
[1:03:33] quote he quoted has got to compare with
[1:03:36] the Bible you just can't take it just
[1:03:39] one scripture and make an understanding
[1:03:43] then say well this is what it says and
[1:03:45] then turn around and say well but over
[1:03:46] here it says something else contradicts
[1:03:48] this it can't do that it's got to say
[1:03:52] the same thing all the time if you don't
[1:03:54] why then you're wrong kind of playing in
[1:03:59] it
[1:03:59] you're wrong so now let's go to number 7
[1:04:06] we're just going to go through this real
[1:04:07] quick because we covered this last
[1:04:09] Sunday and I even went back to the
[1:04:12] commentaries and commentators and did
[1:04:14] the same thing
[1:04:15] the issue was given on the 14th day of
[1:04:18] March BC 4:45 the issue went forth to
[1:04:21] build rebuild the temple which is right
[1:04:23] here right here 445 BC they built the
[1:04:27] temple 49 years everybody got that
[1:04:29] saying man we already covered this you
[1:04:33] understand as the people have read the
[1:04:34] scripture then until it was completed it
[1:04:36] took 49 years to complete the temple and
[1:04:38] the city to rebuild it as the Bible said
[1:04:41] here Daniel speaking of their angel to
[1:04:43] Daniel that the walls we built in
[1:04:45] trouble sometimes than many of us
[1:04:47] remember when it was built they had a
[1:04:48] mortar block in one hand and a sword in
[1:04:49] the other hand to watch the enemy so now
[1:04:52] let's look at Nehemiah
[1:04:54] let's drop all the way down to Nehemiah
[1:04:56] we read all that scripture about how
[1:04:58] brother Branham came up with that date
[1:04:59] right remember Nehemiah was the
[1:05:02] cupbearer for for what's his name the
[1:05:08] king so he had he was armor he was a cup
[1:05:13] bearer so he would only go in in the
[1:05:16] month listen according to near my 2:1 in
[1:05:18] the twentieth year of artaxerxes the
[1:05:20] king that wine was before him in the
[1:05:22] only served wine during the Passover
[1:05:25] which was 14 days if you'll go back and
[1:05:27] figure your Passover is 14 days after
[1:05:29] the first day of the month so that's
[1:05:30] where brother Branham came up with March
[1:05:32] the 14th so precise BC 445 that wine was
[1:05:37] before him and I took the wine and give
[1:05:39] it unto the king now the King saw that
[1:05:41] Nehemiah was he's very sad so he let him
[1:05:45] go build a temple let's go through there
[1:05:47] might go to near my 417 mm-hmm go to 17
[1:05:55] they which building on the wall and they
[1:05:56] that bear burdens with those that laded
[1:05:58] and every one with one hand rock of the
[1:06:00] word and the other will held a weapon so
[1:06:01] what they were doing they were building
[1:06:02] the wall and you had another group of
[1:06:04] people with swords because nobody wanted
[1:06:06] to rebuild the temple there may got that
[1:06:08] this is just a filler to show where
[1:06:09] we're coming up to okay
[1:06:10] all right so let's go to number eight
[1:06:13] now we've done building the temple and
[1:06:16] then there's a 62 week period and the
[1:06:18] Messiah's gonna show up during that time
[1:06:20] there buddy got that this is the Messiah
[1:06:23] he's showing up and he's preaching he
[1:06:26] was born we see again he was
[1:06:28] at 4 in 4 BC according to all of your
[1:06:33] commentaries except for two or three and
[1:06:40] you'll see where brother bottom does say
[1:06:41] a t-33 sometimes but you got to remember
[1:06:45] I'll read you a quote number nine on the
[1:06:48] sixth seal but let's read this right
[1:06:51] here now Jesus the Messiah wrote into
[1:06:53] the city of Jerusalem triumphal on the
[1:06:55] back of a white mule on Palm Sunday
[1:06:56] April the 2nd ad 30 Jesus wrote in
[1:07:01] Jerusalem on Palm Sunday on ad 30 now
[1:07:04] this is a t30 when he was killed
[1:07:05] everybody got that that's when he was
[1:07:08] cut off that's not when he started his
[1:07:10] message that's when he got cut off
[1:07:12] alright so you say well brother branham
[1:07:15] how in the world you get that well let's
[1:07:17] go to the sixth seal now if we say if
[1:07:20] you say if they say if whoever says that
[1:07:23] brother branham got greater
[1:07:24] understanding when the seal is open then
[1:07:28] because there's a lot of people tell you
[1:07:30] that it was a t-33 but what's this and I
[1:07:35] went back to the Bible and found another
[1:07:37] good no yet but we'll save that for
[1:07:39] later now let's stop there these three
[1:07:42] verses now what is brother Ramon the
[1:07:44] sixth seal he has gone to Matthew 24 to
[1:07:48] bring all six seals into the Bible he
[1:07:50] goes to Matthew 24 and starts preaching
[1:07:54] the seals but they ask him three
[1:07:56] questions now these three verses that
[1:08:00] took place actually on Tuesday afternoon
[1:08:02] April the 4th 80 30 now he just said he
[1:08:07] wrote into Palm Sunday April the 2nd
[1:08:09] which was Sunday Monday Tuesday 4th
[1:08:15] pretty precise now this gets even better
[1:08:18] and the first two verses took place in
[1:08:21] the afternoon now that I won't get he's
[1:08:25] a prophet I believe what he said ok the
[1:08:30] afternoon of April the 4th is a t30 the
[1:08:32] third verse took place on Tuesday even
[1:08:34] in the same day I just I don't know
[1:08:37] I just believe what he said but that's
[1:08:40] just to clarify that
[1:08:42] was Jesus died in a t30 because if he's
[1:08:45] born in 4bc and he was 33 years old when
[1:08:48] he died
[1:08:49] 84 to 80 30 you say that's 34 years you
[1:08:52] can't have a zero year it's 4 3 2 1 1 2
[1:08:58] 3 4 up to 30 right everybody got their
[1:09:01] what I've been through this there's no
[1:09:02] zero year so you cancel that year out
[1:09:05] and go 1 2 1 ending up with something
[1:09:07] that's just perfect the words perfect
[1:09:08] the word of God is perfect if you look
[1:09:11] at it real good everything else will be
[1:09:12] perfect now let's read number 10
[1:09:15] cuz now look he'd look back here he died
[1:09:18] he's crucified he's left the scene he's
[1:09:21] come back on the day of Pentecost and he
[1:09:24] has now started working in a Gentile
[1:09:26] bride for 2,000 years then he's going to
[1:09:29] take us in a rapture and to fulfill the
[1:09:34] 490 years there's got to be seven years
[1:09:37] left are one week there buddy got that
[1:09:41] same man because the Bible in Daniel
[1:09:44] 9:27 says he shall confirm the covenant
[1:09:46] with many for one week one week equal 7
[1:09:50] years everybody got that same n right
[1:09:53] amen now watch now we come up and we get
[1:09:58] them up here to the rejection of the
[1:09:59] Messiah from the rejecting of the
[1:10:02] Messiah when he comes up to the
[1:10:03] rejection of the Messiah you got the
[1:10:05] last week from the projecting the size
[1:10:10] of lap Masada last week now I want to
[1:10:12] stop right here just a minute and
[1:10:13] explain this that when they rejected the
[1:10:16] Messiah was when they of course rejected
[1:10:18] Jesus as Savior and crucified him so
[1:10:20] where's you saying right here 80 30
[1:10:22] which would have been about April the
[1:10:24] 6th if you're going by your dates
[1:10:26] Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday they
[1:10:29] killed him on Friday so it'd be the 6 or
[1:10:32] 7 somewhere in there cuz remember
[1:10:33] Jewish days don't end like our days
[1:10:36] Jewish days end at 6 o'clock when it
[1:10:38] comes to 6 o'clock in Israel that starts
[1:10:41] another day that's why they had to get
[1:10:44] Jesus Christ off the cross before that
[1:10:46] hour of 6:00 o'clock hit because that
[1:10:48] was a Passover and it was the high
[1:10:51] Passover because it came on a Sabbath
[1:10:53] day
[1:10:54] and it was the Passover came on the same
[1:10:55] day so they had to get him off the crop
[1:10:58] so they would have to left him 24 more
[1:11:00] hours hanging on the cross but according
[1:11:02] to the Bible that couldn't do that so
[1:11:04] they had to get him off the crops before
[1:11:05] 6 o'clock which starts a new day in
[1:11:08] Israel that's why the Bible says the
[1:11:11] evening and the morning was the first
[1:11:15] thing y'all learn something you stay
[1:11:20] awake or was that
[1:11:25] you remember over here how the city
[1:11:28] should be cut off but not for himself
[1:11:29] Messiah the Prince now think I'll close
[1:11:31] that prophecy hit I want to get this
[1:11:34] drilled into you want y'all to realize
[1:11:38] one thing going through this Daniel 70
[1:11:41] week series brother branham is so
[1:11:43] positive he's so positive
[1:11:47] how can people say he was wrong he's so
[1:11:51] positive he wants to get this drilled
[1:11:54] into you then if that prophecy hit
[1:11:57] exactly to the day exactly to the time
[1:11:59] and we're talking about 80 30 and
[1:12:02] exactly the way it said it would this
[1:12:05] other seven this one seven weeks left or
[1:12:09] one week left if I got that one seven
[1:12:13] years rather seven days seven years will
[1:12:16] hit exactly according to the scripture
[1:12:18] so is he talking about three and a half
[1:12:20] or seven talk about seven there's seven
[1:12:23] years left to make 490 483 years Christ
[1:12:28] was cut off and he took a Gentile bride
[1:12:31] listen brothers and sister if he didn't
[1:12:36] if they had not done all this over here
[1:12:39] to him this would have all slid right
[1:12:41] here together and it would have just
[1:12:44] been a continuous God coming right here
[1:12:47] and then coming right straight to them
[1:12:49] but he had to get a Gentile bride that's
[1:12:52] me and you oh man come on that's me in
[1:12:55] you I you know I thank God he blinded
[1:13:00] Israel
[1:13:01] but he knew he had to to get us cuz you
[1:13:05] know what when he lifts his hands
[1:13:07] brother reggae bro when he lifts his
[1:13:09] hands they're going to see him in three
[1:13:12] and a half years a hundred and forty
[1:13:14] four thousand people are going to
[1:13:15] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:17] it took two thousand years almost for us
[1:13:20] to get that many people why because of
[1:13:23] all of our isms and all this other stuff
[1:13:24] listen these Jews right here knew that
[1:13:27] Messiah was one God but God had to blind
[1:13:33] them so that you and I could come in but
[1:13:35] all he promised he'll come back lift his
[1:13:38] hands off of them they say Oh where'd
[1:13:40] you get those scars he'll say in the
[1:13:42] house of my friends through those two
[1:13:44] prophets alright stop preaching Daniel
[1:13:47] 9:27 we'll get through this hey all
[1:13:50] right all right this is the last or this
[1:13:53] is number 3 this is the third period we
[1:13:56] just went through one in two and got 483
[1:14:00] years doesn't count in here Gentile time
[1:14:02] you know you and I don't have a time
[1:14:03] time shall be no longer but they've got
[1:14:07] when we leave here they've got 1260 days
[1:14:10] to receive Christ but they've got a
[1:14:12] seven-year period to get us into the
[1:14:14] Millenium this is where you're gonna
[1:14:17] have to really pay attention okay Daniel
[1:14:22] 9:27 he shall confirm the covenant with
[1:14:24] many for one week now who's that he that
[1:14:27] he is not Christ Christ does not break
[1:14:31] covenants amen that's the Antichrist
[1:14:37] because he's only gonna come on the
[1:14:39] scene sure he's here with us now but
[1:14:42] he's going to incarnate a beast when we
[1:14:44] leave the man he's going to incarnate a
[1:14:47] person the beast is going to incarnate
[1:14:49] the Pope and in the midst of the week
[1:14:53] which is what what's the middle of 7
[1:14:56] class three and a half and in the midst
[1:15:03] of the week he shall cause the sacrifice
[1:15:04] and oblation to cease what happens is
[1:15:08] God has took the 1260 he's give them the
[1:15:11] Ministry of Messiah he's given the masai
[1:15:14] message like he did over here he's given
[1:15:18] three-and-a-half-year my site message
[1:15:20] and when they see it they're gonna leave
[1:15:21] now that doesn't mean this right here is
[1:15:23] over
[1:15:24] there's still time we already proved
[1:15:26] that because he's gonna walk in the
[1:15:27] temple he he the Antichrist and say hey
[1:15:30] I'm the god you're looking for they're
[1:15:33] Jews are gonna go no you're not so then
[1:15:36] there's gonna be a battle of Armageddon
[1:15:38] and it's going to destroy this place
[1:15:42] because you got to fulfil the last part
[1:15:45] of the six fold purpose to bring in
[1:15:46] everlasting righteousness seal up the
[1:15:47] vision and prophecy in the North the
[1:15:49] most holy all right so now let's go to
[1:15:52] number 11 we're gonna read 11 12 and 13
[1:15:55] and then we're gonna click it off for
[1:15:59] just a second now we find out that down
[1:16:02] through these ages we have the Holy
[1:16:03] Spirit come in and then God back in the
[1:16:06] beginning began to tell them that the
[1:16:08] rejection of Christ God showed John
[1:16:10] exactly what would take place during the
[1:16:11] Gentile reign he's talking about John
[1:16:13] the Revelator revelations 1 through 3
[1:16:16] Israel is the church ages right all
[1:16:18] right during the Gentile right now you
[1:16:21] haven't got any limited time like the
[1:16:24] Jews but we got a sign
[1:16:26] we got a signpost now whose brother bran
[1:16:28] tell us what our signpost is watch
[1:16:30] Israel it's this Israel Israel's the
[1:16:32] timepiece well God did with the Jews
[1:16:35] just exactly what he said he would do in
[1:16:37] them 69 years or 483 years 69 weeks and
[1:16:42] one week left one weeks yet determined
[1:16:47] everybody got that same man one week is
[1:16:51] yet determined all right number 12 he's
[1:17:00] talking about somebody applied it
[1:17:03] 144,000 to be the bride and in 1917
[1:17:09] there was gonna be a rapture and
[1:17:10] somebody preached that I don't know who
[1:17:11] it was but but it wasn't true but let's
[1:17:13] go down to the to the red and we see now
[1:17:17] all this stuff was to take place was
[1:17:19] over in this time of the 70th week now
[1:17:23] look they appear not in the third
[1:17:25] chapter what's the third chapter
[1:17:26] revelations that's us
[1:17:28] their own over in the scripture further
[1:17:32] and then we see that all this stuff was
[1:17:35] to take place was over in this time of
[1:17:38] the 70th week the last week now if
[1:17:43] they've already had 69 weeks and lived
[1:17:46] it exactly the way God said they would
[1:17:48] do said they did and it happened exactly
[1:17:50] the way God said it would do then
[1:17:52] there's one more week promised to the
[1:17:56] Jews everybody got that same man one
[1:17:58] more week promised to the Jews after we
[1:18:01] leave after revelations three is over
[1:18:04] revelations for one remember we go in
[1:18:06] the rapture and brother Brown said what
[1:18:08] covers that revelations forward to
[1:18:10] revelations 19 and it does that every
[1:18:12] bit happens right here in this last week
[1:18:14] not this life's three and a half years
[1:18:18] there's one full week left after we
[1:18:21] leave to finish the 70 weeks of Daniel
[1:18:24] there's one more week promised to the
[1:18:27] Jews nobody got that same in number
[1:18:30] thirteen what's going down to the save
[1:18:35] time where are we at right here
[1:18:39] I believe you pointed right here so
[1:18:42] that's we're in that seventh Church age
[1:18:43] we're right here ready to go up where
[1:18:46] did the Messiah get cut off exactly
[1:18:48] where the word said where the Messiah
[1:18:50] get cut off right here right where will
[1:18:54] that 70th week begin exactly after this
[1:18:58] church is cut off then God returns to
[1:19:01] the Jews now where'd you point that now
[1:19:04] 70th week right nobody got that and the
[1:19:09] Bob now this is cording to the Bible and
[1:19:11] the prophets message now I want to ask
[1:19:13] you a question when I read these next
[1:19:16] scriptures I don't want the butterflies
[1:19:18] to start churning okay because when I
[1:19:22] read you these next quotes you're
[1:19:24] butterflies are gonna start churning
[1:19:25] because you're gonna go what in the
[1:19:28] world is going on let me tell you
[1:19:33] something I can't change the Bible and
[1:19:36] brother Branham was right
[1:19:38] and if brother Branham was wrong god
[1:19:41] corrected him and then brother Branham
[1:19:43] came to the pulpit and told us that God
[1:19:46] corrected him right all during the seals
[1:19:49] he thought - mm-hmm he thought the wild
[1:19:52] horse rider was a Holy Ghost he come
[1:19:54] right out here and he said contrary to
[1:19:56] what I believe this is the way it is all
[1:19:58] the way through the seals he said fifth
[1:20:00] seal Jew he thought maybe that was a
[1:20:01] martyred souls down through the church
[1:20:03] ages that was not correct he come right
[1:20:06] out here and said that was wrong and
[1:20:08] then all the things that he needed
[1:20:10] corrected God corrected William Branham
[1:20:12] William Branham corrected itself and
[1:20:13] then we accept that a man if you correct
[1:20:16] William Branham you have inserted
[1:20:18] yourself between God and him and I don't
[1:20:20] know there's not a place for that well
[1:20:22] there is but remember if you got to
[1:20:29] hello you got to one's got to be the
[1:20:33] devil okay hello somebody thank your
[1:20:37] sister well that 70th week began exactly
[1:20:40] after this church is cut off so when we
[1:20:42] leave this world there's one more week
[1:20:45] to fulfill our seven years to fulfill
[1:20:49] Daniel seventy weeks of 490 years if I
[1:20:52] got that say man I've read enough quotes
[1:20:54] and I read enough Bible now we're gonna
[1:20:56] read hold on here's where the
[1:20:59] butterflies start now when I ask you a
[1:21:02] question again many people in their mind
[1:21:06] they think that before 1963
[1:21:11] the brother Brian did say some things
[1:21:13] that were wrong and and he did because
[1:21:15] he preached a while was writer was the
[1:21:17] Holy Ghost okay but under his revelation
[1:21:20] at the time he was right that's all he
[1:21:24] had don't throw the baby out with the
[1:21:27] bathwater
[1:21:28] but his progress his revelation come on
[1:21:31] up to a time to where God said that's
[1:21:33] not right you've come to a place of
[1:21:36] adoption to where they're gonna have to
[1:21:39] listen to you every word of what you're
[1:21:41] saying and you're going to tell them
[1:21:43] right you're gonna tell them the correct
[1:21:47] way this is the correct way that's why
[1:21:50] look was there any error and
[1:21:52] this is three and a half you're missing
[1:21:55] was there any error in a massage message
[1:21:59] no it was perfect
[1:22:02] so that perfect word had to come back in
[1:22:06] the end time and that same perfect words
[1:22:09] gonna take that bail off with the Jews
[1:22:12] and show them aside if I got that same
[1:22:16] in pretty simple so now one more time
[1:22:20] Bible says you've got seven weeks
[1:22:23] sixty-two weeks and one week that's
[1:22:25] sixty two and seven sixty ninety one
[1:22:27] because seventy weeks is what's
[1:22:29] determined to finish those six things in
[1:22:32] Revelations not I mean Daniel not
[1:22:34] everybody got that say man all right
[1:22:37] here we go ready for the butterflies now
[1:22:41] watch watch the date on this one right
[1:22:44] here the reason I'm saying this is
[1:22:46] everybody said well he was confused and
[1:22:48] then maybe he was confused in the
[1:22:50] seventy weeks of Daniel because it was
[1:22:51] 1962
[1:22:52] I mean look who told who told you who
[1:22:57] told you that brother Branham was
[1:22:58] confused yeah it's that guy in between
[1:23:03] who told you he was confused
[1:23:06] that's why I can't stand about these
[1:23:07] people leave the message brother Branham
[1:23:10] was confused so that meant they weren't
[1:23:12] see what I mean see what I mean but they
[1:23:15] said he was confused then he was wasted
[1:23:19] three sermons I guess on Daniel seventy
[1:23:21] weeks and then God straightened him out
[1:23:23] over here when he started preaching the
[1:23:24] seals when I don't told you again I want
[1:23:27] you to bring me one quote where brother
[1:23:28] Graham said I was wrong in Daniel
[1:23:30] seventy weeks and now I'm correcting
[1:23:32] them he did not he kept saying we're
[1:23:35] gonna have to get this out of the way so
[1:23:36] we can get to the seals now watch this
[1:23:40] this is in not though the next quote
[1:23:41] this is in 1955 hey buddy wake Lord
[1:23:48] don't go sleep at 11:30 in the morning
[1:23:49] II I know it's rough it 2 o'clock in the
[1:23:53] afternoon but you just got up some of
[1:23:57] you all right
[1:23:59] number 14 watch this this is 1955 we're
[1:24:03] doing pretty good I thought we'd go over
[1:24:04] or not
[1:24:06] now watch now then all these visions now
[1:24:09] this is 1955 like I said again watch his
[1:24:12] thought in 1955
[1:24:14] because he comes up to 62 and he
[1:24:17] preaches the 70 weeks of Daniel then he
[1:24:19] comes over and I'm gonna show you some
[1:24:20] quotes during the seals that seems
[1:24:22] totally contrary but they're not just
[1:24:27] where the nation's would be standing he
[1:24:29] showed them how that there was so many
[1:24:31] years depending yet on the Jews what's
[1:24:33] he doing he's he's basically commenting
[1:24:36] on Daniel 9 he said to myself shall come
[1:24:39] he will prophesy in the 70th week which
[1:24:43] is three and a half years and the amidst
[1:24:45] event he will be cut off which is seven
[1:24:48] years 70 weeks is determined for the
[1:24:51] people seven years remaining
[1:24:53] approximately to the Jews
[1:24:56] this is 1955 and the Messiah the Prince
[1:25:00] shall come and prophesy in the midst of
[1:25:01] the seven weeks now the Bible does not
[1:25:02] say that the Bible doesn't say that the
[1:25:12] bible says nowhere that Messiah be cut
[1:25:13] off in the middle of week but watch what
[1:25:18] he's saying watch what he's saying
[1:25:21] what brother Branham has done if you'll
[1:25:25] stop right there bring that up can you
[1:25:27] bring that chart up brother Joe cuz look
[1:25:30] what Messiah
[1:25:31] Messiah Messiah Messiah remember that
[1:25:36] word what Messiah only preached reading
[1:25:38] half here then Messiah is going to come
[1:25:40] back three preached three and a half
[1:25:41] more years for the 1260 days as
[1:25:45] everybody got that same in now he
[1:25:50] preached three and a half years this is
[1:25:52] a brother Bob black did this chart and
[1:25:54] it is amazing and he just keeps adding
[1:25:56] stuff to it every time we've been
[1:25:57] preaching on it and I couldn't bring it
[1:25:59] because watch scroll that thing across
[1:26:03] that thing would cover that wall it just
[1:26:07] keeps going doc doc all right so go back
[1:26:12] but thank God brother Bob did that but I
[1:26:15] watched wolf stop right there Jesus
[1:26:17] preached three and a half years of a
[1:26:19] message from 80 26 to 80 30 and then he
[1:26:24] was cut off
[1:26:25] now go scroll over to about the middle
[1:26:28] of it Joe please god bless you thank you
[1:26:31] now one week of Jesus's ministry was not
[1:26:35] the 70th week everybody got that because
[1:26:39] you split it up you got three and a half
[1:26:41] years over here and you got three and a
[1:26:42] half years over here now what his
[1:26:44] brother branham doing guys
[1:26:46] brother branham is not wrong he's
[1:26:49] telling you he is taking the whole 70
[1:26:53] weeks of Daniel all those dates all
[1:26:55] those times and all those things that
[1:26:57] are going to happen Gentile church age
[1:26:59] whatever more he's pulled all that out
[1:27:01] and made it just one week and it's three
[1:27:06] and a half years of Jesus's ministry
[1:27:08] right here and three and a half years of
[1:27:10] Jesus's ministry right here now go that
[1:27:13] way but that's inside of that 70th week
[1:27:16] it's not the hole it's not the whole
[1:27:18] week Bible says there's one week left
[1:27:21] when we leave oh I love it
[1:27:26] we're going to wait and suffer it Bob
[1:27:27] did a good job that didn't get ba ba ba
[1:27:29] Han
[1:27:30] Bob down in Mobile Alabama today with us
[1:27:32] with his family I told him I said don't
[1:27:35] put bombs and stuff in there dude just
[1:27:37] he's gonna put a Tomic bomb and all the
[1:27:40] other stuff going on anyway but he
[1:27:42] brought a good that's the Millennial
[1:27:44] temple according to Ezekiel 42 44 it's
[1:27:46] got to be built right in here this is
[1:27:49] wonderful I love it if you wanted I'm
[1:27:51] out but I'm telling you it's gonna have
[1:27:52] to be on a piece of paper about that big
[1:27:54] or it's gonna be so condensed you're
[1:27:55] gonna need a scope to see it so that's
[1:27:59] why they put it on here so we've
[1:28:02] condensed this and so his brother
[1:28:04] branham look at this shout boys Trump I
[1:28:07] love that dude he's good all right go
[1:28:11] back over that way he even puts the
[1:28:12] horse riders in there see him down at
[1:28:15] the bottom white horse first three
[1:28:17] Church ages red horse black horse pale
[1:28:19] horse Dome of the rock was completed in
[1:28:22] six 891 AD 325 and ICN council Titus is
[1:28:28] coming in right here and destroying
[1:28:29] Jerusalem in AD 70
[1:28:31] so now
[1:28:32] brother branham has got to be talking
[1:28:34] about another week not another week
[1:28:40] apart from 70 weeks but another week
[1:28:42] inside of the 70 weeks of Daniel or he's
[1:28:44] wrong everybody got that
[1:28:48] and he's not but you can't place it
[1:28:53] without using this one week of Jesus's
[1:28:56] ministry three and a half years over
[1:28:58] here and three and a half years over
[1:29:00] here he was cut off in the midst of the
[1:29:03] week for who for us but he wasn't cut
[1:29:07] off in the midst of the whole 70 weeks
[1:29:09] of Daniel he was only cut off after he
[1:29:11] preached three and a half years because
[1:29:14] while I'm gonna read you a couple quotes
[1:29:15] here where brother Branham says talks
[1:29:18] about the seventy weeks of Daniel he
[1:29:19] says that's seven years so he condenses
[1:29:22] that whole all that we've draw we've
[1:29:25] drawn over here
[1:29:26] he's condensed it to one week of Messiah
[1:29:31] ministry three and a half years here
[1:29:33] that he preached himself and then
[1:29:36] through two prophets he preaches three
[1:29:38] and a half years more here for them to
[1:29:41] go in the rapture go back over that way
[1:29:49] you ever make those little rabbit wake
[1:29:55] up a little bit you didn't know we were
[1:29:58] gonna eat off
[1:30:01] but you ready here you feel better now
[1:30:06] but there's still one week left after
[1:30:08] the rapture you cannot get away from the
[1:30:10] Bible and what brother Brown said
[1:30:12] there's the 70th week which is the six
[1:30:16] fold purpose but there's only three and
[1:30:18] a half years of Jesus's ministry here
[1:30:20] see how Bob's got it drawn over to here
[1:30:22] and then there's only three and a half
[1:30:24] here Messiah does get cut off he gets
[1:30:28] cut off but it never says in the Bible
[1:30:30] he gets cut off in the midst of the week
[1:30:31] read it find it it's not in there read
[1:30:35] the item is telling us about this
[1:30:36] mysterious wheat because hey that was a
[1:30:39] mysterious time nobody knew who he was
[1:30:42] just the clean of us we were talking
[1:30:44] about people in the message versus
[1:30:45] people that are in
[1:30:46] world not even expect on the beach Jesus
[1:30:50] was not a speck on the beach in the
[1:30:52] world brother Brad said 100 that 1% even
[1:30:55] knew he was on the earth 12 we're his
[1:31:00] friends
[1:31:00] what I'm was the devil and when he hung
[1:31:03] on Calvary guess how many he friends he
[1:31:05] had zero all right
[1:31:09] but the greatest most powerful message
[1:31:11] ever to hit this earth and he was
[1:31:14] rejected well he's going to be accepted
[1:31:16] back over here you and I accept him
[1:31:18] through here we get this strand 1/2 your
[1:31:20] message right over there that's what
[1:31:22] we're we're living under that right now
[1:31:25] they weren't living under that in here
[1:31:27] because it wasn't all perfect it wasn't
[1:31:29] the perfect message they all had what
[1:31:31] their flaws the red horse rider came the
[1:31:33] black horse rider came all these
[1:31:34] different riders which was the
[1:31:36] Antichrist what that was him having his
[1:31:39] revival while God was having his revival
[1:31:42] all right the other Cross is having a
[1:31:45] revival I'll promise you go look outside
[1:31:47] you'll see it all right so now he will
[1:31:51] prophesy leave that up and we'll read
[1:31:53] the quote but leave that up he will
[1:31:55] prophesy in the 70th week which is three
[1:31:58] and a half years and in the midst of it
[1:32:00] he will be cut off which is seven years
[1:32:02] seven two weeks is determined for thy
[1:32:04] people seven years approximately to the
[1:32:06] Jews so he came and preached to him here
[1:32:09] they rejected him he got cut off and
[1:32:10] they're gonna come back over here and
[1:32:11] preach the same message over here
[1:32:13] everybody got that right there which is
[1:32:20] right here and right here
[1:32:25] that's the Ministry of Jesus Christ all
[1:32:28] this other all this other is inclusive
[1:32:32] but not all of it
[1:32:35] you know we that's history now we don't
[1:32:39] have to worry about the building of the
[1:32:40] temple we just put that up there to show
[1:32:42] you how perfect the word was and we're
[1:32:44] not gonna even be here when this happens
[1:32:46] but I'm doing this to show you that
[1:32:50] brother Browns not wrong the Bible's not
[1:32:52] wrong of all this contention in the
[1:32:55] message that there's only three and a
[1:32:58] half years of Jesus's ministry
[1:33:00] left yes there's only three-and-a-half
[1:33:01] years of tribulation yes but there's one
[1:33:05] week left to finish the 70 weeks of
[1:33:08] Daniel according to the Bible according
[1:33:11] to the prophets message I just read you
[1:33:13] quote where will that 70th we begin he's
[1:33:16] after after the church is cut off but in
[1:33:19] 1955 that's what he says right there
[1:33:21] let's keep reading now let's go back to
[1:33:25] the quote so you see where the seven
[1:33:28] years is three and a half and three and
[1:33:30] a half that's a seven year of Jesus's
[1:33:32] ministry alright let's go back to the
[1:33:34] quote which Messiah come Jesus he
[1:33:36] preached he's actually three and a half
[1:33:37] years and was cut off for a sacrifice
[1:33:40] alright now let's go to number 15 this
[1:33:48] is the evening messenger 1963 this would
[1:33:52] be after the seals has been preached I
[1:33:55] mean no this is right before I'm sorry
[1:33:57] right before the seals I was trying to
[1:33:59] work up to it this is right before the
[1:34:01] seals were preached in January of 1963
[1:34:05] the seals were preached in March of 63
[1:34:08] right that right March 63 okay notice
[1:34:12] that the Gentile church has to be taken
[1:34:13] away first for the Jews then the end of
[1:34:15] the 70 weeks of Daniel takes place the
[1:34:18] three and a half year Messiah prophesied
[1:34:21] and then he was cut off the prince in
[1:34:23] the middle of the 70th week and then
[1:34:26] there's three and a half weeks left yet
[1:34:30] that looks kind of confusing because
[1:34:34] he's not getting cut off right here he's
[1:34:38] getting cut off right here three and a
[1:34:41] half years he gets cut off and then he's
[1:34:42] gonna preach three and a half years more
[1:34:44] everybody got that if you know then
[1:34:48] you've made him wrong y'all sit there
[1:34:49] all day and in your head and go well he
[1:34:51] must be wrong well then you need to go
[1:34:53] find you another church if he's wrong
[1:34:56] you need to go find you another place
[1:34:58] and then your souls involved in this I
[1:35:07] don't hang my soul and William Brennan
[1:35:09] but I do hang my soul on what he said I
[1:35:11] hang my soul on Jesus Christ now if
[1:35:13] they're dead
[1:35:16] you hear what I'm saying if his mid
[1:35:19] brother Browns message the different
[1:35:20] than Christ's message then I'm wrong and
[1:35:23] so are you
[1:35:24] amen but he's not wrong he's right he's
[1:35:26] telling us he's condensing this whole 70
[1:35:30] weeks of Daniel to one week of Jesus's
[1:35:33] message
[1:35:34] if not then he's wrong
[1:35:37] and he's not he's condensed all this 70
[1:35:40] weeks down to take us out to that three
[1:35:44] and a half year message here and the
[1:35:45] three and a half year he keeps saying
[1:35:47] over and over at my side I'm gonna read
[1:35:49] this next quote on the first seal
[1:35:50] he says the maasai doctrine yeah all
[1:35:55] right so let's go where we have let's go
[1:35:58] to number 16 this is on the first seal
[1:36:01] now look Malachi 4 he's a prophet
[1:36:04] whoa and restores the original faith of
[1:36:07] the fathers at the end time when the
[1:36:10] Tribulation Period comes now here's a
[1:36:12] little thing we're going to reverse back
[1:36:14] a minute or two three and a half years
[1:36:16] or Daniel 7 two weeks the last half of
[1:36:20] Daniels 70 weeks which is three and a
[1:36:21] half years everybody got that and not
[1:36:29] the last half of that week however Mina
[1:36:33] remembers that from the search ages he's
[1:36:35] never said in here anywhere that he's
[1:36:36] been he's wrong
[1:36:38] good listen this is this is me I don't
[1:36:41] have a quote for it but brother Branham
[1:36:44] preached this it's like brother Dale has
[1:36:46] always said you have to look there it's
[1:36:48] a sa it's a parable with an underlying
[1:36:53] meaning the whole underlying meaning of
[1:36:54] Daniel 7 2 weeks is Redemption and it
[1:36:57] only came by Jesus preaching three and a
[1:36:59] half years and we accepted it and they
[1:37:02] turned it down and then he comes back
[1:37:03] and preaches three and a half more years
[1:37:05] they accept it and they go on the
[1:37:07] rapture all right to me that's all of
[1:37:09] Daniels 70 weeks not all the dates and
[1:37:11] the times and the seasons so now brother
[1:37:16] Branham is honing in on the message the
[1:37:18] Messiah doctrine watch what he says I
[1:37:21] remember that from the church ages see
[1:37:23] them there's 70 weeks determined look
[1:37:25] how perfect it was Messiah will come and
[1:37:27] he'll be cut off
[1:37:28] sacrifice in the midst of the week now
[1:37:29] the Bible doesn't say that find it but
[1:37:34] he's not wrong he's telling you about
[1:37:36] that one week of Messiah message Messiah
[1:37:40] Messiah watch how many times he says
[1:37:41] Messiah he will be cut off for sacrifice
[1:37:45] in the midst of the week and the
[1:37:46] obligation will cease then they're still
[1:37:50] three and a half years waited for the
[1:37:52] maasai doctrine to the Jews just like
[1:37:55] what we just said
[1:37:56] three and a half he was cut off and then
[1:37:58] there's three and a half more there but
[1:37:59] I got that same am no side doctrine
[1:38:02] there watch number 17 now you remember
[1:38:10] that was prophesying the work this is
[1:38:12] the fifth seal we're all clan reading a
[1:38:15] scripture and they prophesied these two
[1:38:16] witnesses prophesied the time of Daniels
[1:38:18] second half of the 70 weeks seventy
[1:38:21] weeks not 70th seventy weeks that's the
[1:38:25] last three and a half years which is
[1:38:26] right here it's the last three and a
[1:38:30] half years of that Messiah week not the
[1:38:33] last three and a half year you can't
[1:38:35] place it it won't go in the Bible
[1:38:37] everybody got that
[1:38:38] the Bible's right you remember how he
[1:38:43] took Daniel 70 weeks I said we would
[1:38:45] need it when we get in here I didn't
[1:38:48] know why but I something told me we need
[1:38:50] it in here we are see see he's not
[1:38:52] saying I was wrong back then he was
[1:38:54] saying we need it now notice in the time
[1:38:57] of Daniel now remember Daniel was told
[1:38:58] that the Messiah would come to Prentiss
[1:39:00] the Messiah rather and he would prophesy
[1:39:02] scrolled up please Israel still had 70
[1:39:07] weeks left now Israel didn't have 70
[1:39:09] weeks less this was no house in two
[1:39:17] weeks left 69 of it was but fulfilled
[1:39:20] back here according to the Bible what's
[1:39:23] he talking about what and in the midst
[1:39:27] of the 70 week
[1:39:29] he's condensed it down to one week every
[1:39:34] bit of it he's condensed to one week in
[1:39:37] the midst of the seven to eight the
[1:39:39] Messiah would be cut off and the daily
[1:39:40] sacrifice taken
[1:39:41] wait but there was still three and a
[1:39:43] half weeks determined in this block he
[1:39:45] takes the Gentile bride now she goes up
[1:39:48] and then when she goes up two prophets
[1:39:50] arrive to Israel all right so everybody
[1:39:52] got that now let's go to the sixth seal
[1:39:56] and this is where he brings it pretty
[1:39:58] plain right here
[1:39:59] all right notice these messengers now
[1:40:00] these messengers revelation 12 these two
[1:40:02] prophets they're going to preach the
[1:40:03] kingdom as a ham kingdom heaven is to be
[1:40:05] set up the time last three and a half
[1:40:07] years of Daniels 70th week promised to
[1:40:09] the Jews now remember now that to prove
[1:40:12] that that this is Daniels last part of
[1:40:14] the 70th we know what you know talking
[1:40:16] about this 70th week right here or he's
[1:40:18] wrong
[1:40:19] because the Bible's right if I got that
[1:40:22] now read you all these other clothes so
[1:40:25] don't turn around and go well we'll take
[1:40:27] these and not these who are you to do
[1:40:30] that I'm looking at all of you who are
[1:40:33] you to do that who are you to take
[1:40:34] quotes out and throw them away and put
[1:40:36] other ones in you've got to understand
[1:40:39] what our prophet said our Wheaton why do
[1:40:41] you think that when people start leaving
[1:40:42] the message this is the first thing they
[1:40:44] hit he was so wrong in Daniel 70 weeks
[1:40:47] well if he was then we need to lead -
[1:40:49] yeah hello I got a question on that for
[1:40:56] DeMarre see now 70 weeks was promised
[1:40:58] look which was seven years seventy weeks
[1:41:03] was promised which was seven years he
[1:41:07] condensed every bit of this right here
[1:41:09] down to a three and a half year message
[1:41:11] here and a three and a half year message
[1:41:12] here you and I are not even included we
[1:41:15] shouldn't even have this in here you and
[1:41:16] I are not included in this I put that in
[1:41:18] there because it is in the spreads the
[1:41:20] week out because so don't worry about
[1:41:23] that you got three and a half years here
[1:41:24] you got three and a half years here so
[1:41:26] this is the first half and this is the
[1:41:30] second half or the last half of the
[1:41:33] Messiah week of the ministry of Jesus
[1:41:35] Christ everybody got that
[1:41:37] now seventy weeks was promised which was
[1:41:41] seven years and in the midst of the
[1:41:44] seven weeks the Messiah was to be cut
[1:41:46] off - made a sacrifice war was that
[1:41:47] right here not over here this guy that
[1:41:52] makes this covenant in this last period
[1:41:54] he's not
[1:41:55] Christ he's the Antichrist he would
[1:42:01] prophesy three and a half years and then
[1:42:03] he'd be cut off he prophesied three and
[1:42:05] a half years cut off and then that three
[1:42:08] and a half years are still determined
[1:42:10] for Israel I don't have a problem with
[1:42:12] that that's what he said
[1:42:16] all right let's go to number 19 this is
[1:42:23] where he said it again in the sixth seal
[1:42:25] notice we find out sometime last I said
[1:42:29] three and a half years of Daniel seventy
[1:42:31] weeks now let me explain that a little
[1:42:32] closer now because I see somebody here
[1:42:34] that's always watch that now I want to
[1:42:36] try to make myself clear a teacher
[1:42:38] notice when the seventy weeks come in
[1:42:40] when Daniels seen division of the time
[1:42:42] coming and the ending of the Jews watch
[1:42:44] but he said there was determined 70
[1:42:47] weeks that's seven years he took all
[1:42:53] that 490 years and condensed it down to
[1:42:55] one week because if you don't vote
[1:42:59] you've got a false prophet cuz I just
[1:43:03] read you these other quotes quote eleven
[1:43:06] twelve and thirteen
[1:43:07] when does that 70th we begin brother
[1:43:09] Branham he says after the church is gone
[1:43:12] and that's exactly right according to
[1:43:16] the Bible and he would be cut off for a
[1:43:18] sacrifice now let's go to number 20 we
[1:43:23] got 20 number 20 and we'll be done so
[1:43:26] this is the continuation they asked him
[1:43:28] this question this is where everybody
[1:43:30] goes to all the preachers go to this and
[1:43:32] say well he was wrong in dang of 70
[1:43:34] weeks but this is where he was right
[1:43:35] well I done told you if you can tell me
[1:43:39] the brother Branham was wrong you have
[1:43:40] inserted yourself between God and him
[1:43:42] and you are the devil and be quiet if
[1:43:48] you won't do we either got to believe
[1:43:50] this thing is number one a I mean
[1:43:53] stamped right or we need to go find a
[1:43:56] Baptist good Baptist Church like them
[1:43:57] other people ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:43:58] goes out to the Baptist Church and just
[1:44:00] lives like they won't - brother Branham
[1:44:05] when you give the message on the 70
[1:44:06] Church ages 70 weeks party this is a
[1:44:08] question
[1:44:09] I believe that you mentioned that the
[1:44:11] fall last week or last seven years will
[1:44:14] begin when the bride was taken in a
[1:44:15] rapture now that's exactly right that's
[1:44:20] what he said
[1:44:24] but he's mind is not on this whole chart
[1:44:27] his mind is on the three and a half
[1:44:31] years of Jesus is preaching here and the
[1:44:33] three and a half years of Jesus is
[1:44:35] preaching here again or he's wrong cuz
[1:44:38] he's the full last week or last seven
[1:44:40] years we'll begin when the bride was
[1:44:41] taking the rapture he says no no no let
[1:44:43] me go back to read you a quote 70th week
[1:44:46] number thirteen where did my son get cut
[1:44:48] off exactly what the word said where
[1:44:50] will that 70 wings begin he's actually
[1:44:52] after this church is cut off that's
[1:44:53] exactly right
[1:44:56] now watch what he is talking about you
[1:45:00] say well who are you well who are you no
[1:45:05] no nenene you got that wrong not the
[1:45:09] full seven weeks the week started when
[1:45:13] Jesus came on earth no what huh the week
[1:45:18] started he's convinced this whole thing
[1:45:21] down to when Jesus came on earth he said
[1:45:24] the Messiah Prince shall come and
[1:45:26] prophesy what brother branham is
[1:45:27] thinking in his mind is when that guy
[1:45:29] asks a question he's thinking the whole
[1:45:31] seven years of Jesus's ministry is right
[1:45:33] here and that's not true but there's got
[1:45:39] to be one week left after the rapture
[1:45:41] Church or the Bible is wrong Lord if we
[1:45:45] got the Bible wrong then we need to just
[1:45:46] go find a bar amen he'll be cut off and
[1:45:55] Jesus preached exactly three and a half
[1:45:57] years now he's going to the preaching
[1:45:59] the Ministry of Jesus Christ he's not
[1:46:02] talking about walls being built he's not
[1:46:04] going about all these other things about
[1:46:05] a Millennial temple he's talking about
[1:46:07] Jesus preaching three and a half years
[1:46:10] which is half of the 70 weeks the seven
[1:46:14] days week week days and there's three
[1:46:16] and a half years left
[1:46:17] what there's three and a half years of
[1:46:18] Jesus's ministry left now let's go down
[1:46:22] a little bit further
[1:46:23] where's my this is the last it will be
[1:46:27] done for him let's go to paragraph 299
[1:46:33] keep going up right there wolf since
[1:46:36] then it seemed like the first three and
[1:46:37] a half years was fulfilled during the
[1:46:39] ministry this is the question he
[1:46:42] continues on with the question well here
[1:46:43] you got it right here of Jesus but the
[1:46:45] expression midst of the week seems to be
[1:46:47] applied only to lanta cross breaking his
[1:46:49] covenant with a know that Antichrist
[1:46:51] breaks his covenant at the end of the
[1:46:52] last three and a half years what the
[1:46:54] last three and a half years of Jesus's
[1:46:55] ministry he's condensed it down to the
[1:46:57] Ministry of Jesus Christ because you
[1:46:59] can't have that Antichrist being right
[1:47:02] here I mean right here and have just
[1:47:05] three and a half years left he makes the
[1:47:06] Covenant the Bible says for one week
[1:47:08] which is seven years everybody got that
[1:47:15] now the Antichrist brakes is coming at
[1:47:18] the end of the last three and a half
[1:47:19] years what is the life straight I hear
[1:47:20] of Jesus's ministry there's not seven
[1:47:24] years of Jesus's ministry left there's
[1:47:26] only three and a half as I understood
[1:47:28] Daniel Tate the first 69 weeks into when
[1:47:31] Jesus wrote in Jerusalem 1830 so that
[1:47:33] three and a half years of his ministry
[1:47:34] would be included in the 69 weeks and
[1:47:36] the full last week before last week or
[1:47:38] seven years would still be fulfilled to
[1:47:40] begin at the rapture please clarify this
[1:47:42] for me now this is his answer you know
[1:47:46] brother sister EVER who it is asked this
[1:47:48] question very fine
[1:47:49] well I believe he got a little mixed up
[1:47:51] on what I said when Jesus came into
[1:47:54] Jerusalem that's exactly right that was
[1:47:55] the end of the see he went right
[1:47:57] straight in from there and was crucified
[1:47:59] and he did prophesy half of the 70 weeks
[1:48:02] he didn't say 70 I mean seven he said he
[1:48:05] prophesied half of the 70 weeks well he
[1:48:08] didn't prophesy half for the 70 weeks if
[1:48:12] you take it exactly purely like what
[1:48:15] we're talking about he did prophesy half
[1:48:18] for the 70 weeks which is what three and
[1:48:22] a half years
[1:48:23] and was cut off soul was made of
[1:48:27] sacrifice in this last day there's three
[1:48:30] and a half years still promised to the
[1:48:32] Jews and that's exactly correct but
[1:48:37] that's inside of the 70 weeks of Daniel
[1:48:42] everybody got that
[1:48:43] if you don't then you know what call
[1:48:46] brother Brown what you want to I just
[1:48:47] read you two different quotes that look
[1:48:48] wrong I said look wrong they seem to be
[1:48:53] totally opposite and they're not they're
[1:48:56] not that Messiah week is inside the 70
[1:49:00] weeks of Daniel covers from 80 445 BC I
[1:49:03] mean 445 BC until they come back and
[1:49:06] bring this millennial temple in
[1:49:08] according to the Bible to finish 490
[1:49:13] years but inside of that is a three and
[1:49:16] a half year Ministry of Jesus Christ and
[1:49:18] another three and a half year ministry
[1:49:19] of Jesus Christ you bring them up like
[1:49:21] Bob put them and put them right here he
[1:49:23] prophesied three and a half he was cut
[1:49:25] off in the last half of the Messiah week
[1:49:27] he prophesized but you cannot put that
[1:49:30] in the Bible if you don't put it the way
[1:49:32] I just told you somebody's got to be
[1:49:35] wrong and I contend today that the Bible
[1:49:39] is right and brother Browns message is
[1:49:41] right hey man I mean I just my if you
[1:49:47] didn't get up this morning thinking
[1:49:49] who's coming to the right church why'd
[1:49:51] you come o for the turkey and dressing
[1:49:52] that's what it was you think I was gonna
[1:49:57] quit and not talk about you one more
[1:49:58] time I'm talking to you Rachel sister
[1:50:02] Rachel sorry brother Dale set out for
[1:50:10] years years and years to take all this
[1:50:14] message that seemed to be wrong parts of
[1:50:18] the message that seemed to be your what
[1:50:20] I said seemed to be wrong he comes
[1:50:23] through those ministers meetings hey
[1:50:24] they had ministers meetings on this in
[1:50:25] the 70s right in the 70s contending that
[1:50:30] brother Branham was wrong until the
[1:50:32] seals open and then all of a sudden
[1:50:33] that's not true there's only but look
[1:50:36] you can't change the Bob
[1:50:38] you cannot change the Bible the Bible
[1:50:41] says there 70 weeks determined there's a
[1:50:46] one as a seven-year 62 me a seven week a
[1:50:49] sixty two week and a one week period
[1:50:51] there's no half weeks in that 70 weeks
[1:50:53] of Daniel the half weeks are when the
[1:50:57] Messiah comes and prophesized the first
[1:50:59] half of his Messiah ministry and then
[1:51:01] the second half of Messiah ministry
[1:51:02] comes and then God takes them in a
[1:51:05] rapture and then you have to fulfill the
[1:51:07] rest of the six fold purpose right we
[1:51:12] proved that so you know I'm like I was
[1:51:18] reading a couple of quotes for brother
[1:51:19] Branham was talking about revival he
[1:51:21] said we said um he said even God can
[1:51:25] start a revival God is a gentleman he
[1:51:29] said God can't start a revival he said a
[1:51:31] revival has to start with the people he
[1:51:33] said a preacher can't even start a rumor
[1:51:34] a minister cannot even start a revival
[1:51:37] he says the people have to start a
[1:51:39] revival they have to get it in their
[1:51:40] mind Israel finally got it in their mind
[1:51:43] they'd had enough of Egypt so they
[1:51:45] wanted a revival so they called for a
[1:51:47] revival then God sent Moses on the scene
[1:51:50] all right so that's what you and I that
[1:51:52] from now this from this point forward
[1:51:56] I'm gonna pray for a revival I'm gonna
[1:52:00] pray for a word revival and I'm going to
[1:52:01] read you where you say walk and we're
[1:52:03] gonna be shouting speaking in tongues
[1:52:04] that's okay that can happen but a word
[1:52:07] revival is reviving what words you
[1:52:10] already got inside of you all right and
[1:52:13] then that'll break forth into all the
[1:52:15] happiness and brother Branham said
[1:52:17] always supernatural things happen at the
[1:52:21] time of a revival and we'll go through
[1:52:23] that we'll start in the Old Testament
[1:52:25] and bring it all the way up through so
[1:52:26] let's stand there to your feet god bless
[1:52:30] you for paying attention or or at least
[1:52:32] enduring it but if we don't if we don't
[1:52:40] get anything get one thing brother
[1:52:43] Branham is right
[1:52:45] and the Bible's right and they
[1:52:48] absolutely dovetail with each other you
[1:52:55] say well what about this quote and what
[1:52:56] about that quote what about Jesus
[1:52:57] walking up everyone Dan said look unless
[1:52:59] you eat my flesh and drink my blood you
[1:53:00] have an apartment
[1:53:01] come on up here and we'll sing a song
[1:53:03] thank you Richard
[1:53:05] yeah sisters go down and get ready for
[1:53:07] them for the meal but come on let's sing
[1:53:10] a song and just give them a little time
[1:53:12] of to get this stuff ready we will we
[1:53:17] will be all eating together today mmm
[1:53:20] god bless you like sitting in for paying
[1:53:22] attention weep we've tried in this
[1:53:24] church we don't we don't contend it
[1:53:31] anything is wrong that the Prophet
[1:53:34] preached or the Bible we just we know
[1:53:36] one thing's for sure if Jesus stood up
[1:53:38] and said eat my flesh and drink my blood
[1:53:40] I got a quote now where Jesus said right
[1:53:43] here you got to eat my flesh and drink
[1:53:45] my blood now how many of people that had
[1:53:48] a revelation did that we took communion
[1:53:52] they took communion by that one quote
[1:53:55] that's verbatim Danny brother if you
[1:53:59] don't eat my flesh and drink my blood
[1:54:00] you'll have no part with me nobody I'll
[1:54:04] guarantee you they was a group remember
[1:54:06] that 70 that was around him that
[1:54:08] couldn't handle that and they left why
[1:54:11] because they took him literal if you
[1:54:13] take literal quotes by brother Branham
[1:54:15] you can pick it apart but if you'll take
[1:54:17] the Bible and the prophets message and
[1:54:19] take the Holy Ghost you supposed to have
[1:54:21] and put it together it's got to fit it
[1:54:26] can't not fit how in the world can you
[1:54:28] take the Holy Ghost the Word of God that
[1:54:33] that the Holy Ghost wrote the Word of
[1:54:34] God and you look at the word of God and
[1:54:35] your Holy Ghost says I don't think
[1:54:37] that's right you can't do that you just
[1:54:40] can't or you can but you won't be the
[1:54:42] Christ you'll be the Antichrist and I
[1:54:44] don't want us to do that I wants to be
[1:54:45] happy in the Lord let's say a couple of

[1:58:08] I bless your name I'm sure
[1:58:17] listen God's not the author of confusion
[1:58:20] he will not confuse you if you're
[1:58:23] confused it is the devil that's not you
[1:58:27] but if you ever ask God you know right
[1:58:32] when you get down to that Nazi and
[1:58:34] council back in 325 AD they they come
[1:58:38] with an idea started as an idea that
[1:58:42] Jesus was not God but they were so
[1:58:46] overwhelmed by the doctrine of that day
[1:58:48] that they came and said no no no that's
[1:58:51] not right
[1:58:52] Jesus Jesus was God same substance it
[1:58:56] took 300 years for the devil all that
[1:59:01] saying just kept going that didn't that
[1:59:02] didn't satisfy some people and it wasn't
[1:59:06] of God and we know that because look
[1:59:08] what it turned into 300 years later that
[1:59:11] Jesus was a like substance the demigod
[1:59:13] and then there was a father son Holy
[1:59:14] Ghost baptism and then there's all these
[1:59:16] other things that the Catholic Church
[1:59:17] instituted but it took 300 years Satan
[1:59:20] you know what Satan is just as patient
[1:59:22] as God is it took him three hundred more
[1:59:25] years and now look 2,000 years it's to
[1:59:27] the devil since Jesus left the scene it
[1:59:30] took 2,000 years for the devil through
[1:59:32] all them horse riders to come to this
[1:59:34] very end time with a pale horse but what
[1:59:37] do you do he started over here with
[1:59:38] false doctrine come all the way through
[1:59:40] well now what's he doing he's letting
[1:59:42] people go to church and do all these
[1:59:43] different things and do whatever they
[1:59:45] want to do but then well yeah I was
[1:59:47] saved when I was 11 years old I went to
[1:59:49] the altar what are you doing now well I
[1:59:52] I still drink and curse and smoke and do
[1:59:54] all the things I used to do like I've
[1:59:57] told the story before and I tell it
[2:00:01] again I I just got converted I ran with
[2:00:05] a bunch of guys that you didn't have to
[2:00:08] you'd have to carry a gun to kill them
[2:00:10] with I could kill them with my mouth you
[2:00:13] know you can kill about somebody with
[2:00:14] your mouth walk working again it's easy
[2:00:16] to shoot somebody with a gun
[2:00:17] but you kill their influence brother
[2:00:19] Brian said you kill the man you kill
[2:00:20] influence so that was my problem but I
[2:00:23] got converted and I had a banker friend
[2:00:26] of mine I had a business in town I had a
[2:00:28] banker friend of mine we were out to
[2:00:29] boat fishing John knew something
[2:00:33] happened cuz I wasn't acting the way I
[2:00:35] used to I they used to bring all their
[2:00:38] dirty magazines and dirty movies and
[2:00:40] they played all weekend we'd go fishing
[2:00:41] and have a beer and I'm just telling you
[2:00:43] the truth told him I didn't want to do
[2:00:46] that no more I went over in a different
[2:00:48] place and sat down
[2:00:49] well me and John got in the boat in that
[2:00:51] fishing he's big bank president up in
[2:00:53] Gainesville I said John I don't he you
[2:00:57] know they always want had you a beer
[2:00:59] don't matter if they ever never seen you
[2:01:01] before they buddy up there said no John
[2:01:03] I don't do that no more
[2:01:04] I said I got saved just a few months ago
[2:01:07] he raised his beer and he said what's
[2:01:10] great so am i you don't like that and I
[2:01:13] said I said John we're out here in this
[2:01:16] boat I said what does save mean and he
[2:01:24] just kind of looked at me I said now if
[2:01:26] I took you and threw you off for this
[2:01:28] boat into that water
[2:01:30] you'd need saving but if I saved you I
[2:01:35] would pick you up I like water that
[2:01:38] you're drowning in and I'd set you in
[2:01:40] the boat now what's changed something's
[2:01:43] changed you're not in that water anymore
[2:01:47] you're saved from what you once did and
[2:01:50] of course you get that faraway stare
[2:01:51] they just look at you you know I said I
[2:01:55] don't do those things anymore because I
[2:01:56] got saved and I just look to him I said
[2:01:58] John would you get saved from
[2:02:01] if you were saved I said what you get
[2:02:03] saved from and he never did say another
[2:02:05] word just laughed and went on you know
[2:02:07] but that's the way the world is yeah
[2:02:09] that's why says think about this revival
[2:02:11] brother Ram talks about revivals of
[2:02:13] different ages and we'll go through them
[2:02:15] because I think it's I think it's some
[2:02:17] important that we go through and see how
[2:02:20] look what happened to brother Branham I
[2:02:22] don't know if it was Billy Sunday or
[2:02:25] somebody one of them died another one
[2:02:26] came on the scene Smith Wigglesworth
[2:02:28] died or somebody died and brother
[2:02:30] Branham came on the scene I mean just
[2:02:31] the fair few days and we'll show it
[2:02:33] we'll see it during the through the
[2:02:35] history of revival but we need a revival
