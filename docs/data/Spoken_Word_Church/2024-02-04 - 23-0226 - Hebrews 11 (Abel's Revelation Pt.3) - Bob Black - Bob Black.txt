========================================

amen God bless you Saints you glad to be back in the house of the Lord get fortified get a A Renewed blessing come expecting this morning we had a me and brother Aaron had a wonderful time of fellowship with brother Tim last night and and uh we we certainly are come and expecting this morning oh let me share my slides let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we begin our study Lord we thank you God so much for the uh ability and Lord to be able to gather together around your word and we pray Lord that you'll just bless this day and bless bless us Lord right now as we study these things out Lord for the next 30 minutes Lord that you'll just be with us to Quicken our understanding Lord help us to to to Lord that you'll reveal these things to us we ask Lord that you'll just bless brother Tim as he's studying Lord and prepare our hearts to receive what you have in store for us today Lord and we ask this in your name amen so we uh in in in Hebrews 11 chapter or verse one we've been studying how faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen and that's how the El Elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear and by faith in verse four by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh so by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice and that's the that's the thing that made the difference was Abel's revelation of of how to approach to God and the how the situation that he was in in and how to get out that it was blood and the maniac of gdar brother R said Abel had a revelation we're letting that soak just a minute it was a revelation that Abel had that made him just he had a revelation of the requirement of almighty God and he brought a lamb and that's the only way that you'll ever be able to see Divine Healing the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll be by Revelation so Revelation is the most important thing to a Christian the most important thing that's what we're Gathering here today to hear from God so that we can so that God can can speak to us and give an understanding to give us the ability to overcome now we kind of last time we kind of talked about what is a revelation Revelation is what you know you can be taught a lot of things and you know brother Brown will give examples of how the denominations taught a lot of Theology and things that that according to just just an intellectual understanding of the way that you read your Bible you can read ma Matthew 28:19 for example and Come Away with an understanding you think think that you know how to get baptized but a revelation is when God pulls the cover back and reveals the thing that was hidden and and gives you the correct interpretation of the thing by by a supernatural understanding so Revelation is like a like I got this picture of a statue that's being uncovered by the sculpture reveals he pulls pulls back the covering and off off comes the covering then you can see what was hidden behind that behind that covering all along it was it was there all the time but it was hidden so Revelation is the act of revealing or disclosing and and if you look online for the definition of revelation it'll say God's disclosure of himself and his will to his creatures an instance of such communication or disclosure so that's that's what when you read the Bible you can you Can Come Away with just kind of an intellectual understanding but when God reveals to you begins to pull pull the cover back to show you who who he is and what his will is then that's him revealing himself to you and in verse three of of Genesis 4 it says in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and you know I I I just I I think sometimes when we study these things out it should be really I I I what I really want to do is kind of strike something in you to stir you up to go back and read the Bible and meditate on these things like as we're studying out what was Abel's Revelation to go back and uh listen to The Serpent seed message again listen to Listen to um go back and and and really mle over these things because when you're reading these scriptures like like this one here and you just really begin to meditate on why why did Abel why did God Abel respect why did God Abel respect Abel's sacrifice what was the difference there and am I doing something today can I what's my situation like is God going to respect the way my Approach To God because we all just like it's it's a it's a story of of a religious this is a story of a religious person and someone that was had a real revelation of of both both coming trying to approach to God but God respected one and did not respect the other faith is what made the difference amen in the revelation of Jesus Christ brother R said how did Abel know what to do in order to offer a profer sacrifice to God by faith he received the revelation of the blood Cain didn't get such a revelation even though he had a commandment so he couldn't offer the right sacrifice it was a revelation from God that made the difference and gave Abel eternal life now you might take what the pastor says or what the Seminary teaches and though it might be taught to you with eloquence until God reveals to you that Jesus is the Christ and that it is the blood that cleanses you and that God is your savior you will never have eternal life it is the spiritual Revelation that does it think about that that situation that Abel and Cain were both in that they had been taught by their brother R in one place he said that their mother and father or Adam and Eve had taught uh sat down and and and shared like little bible studies and things like that um and you know you we're maybe in the same situation today I I I was sharing on Wednesday night when I was preaching about how when I was young um you know you i' I'd hear Bible stories from my parents and I'd uh it it you know you put it' put me to sleep a lot of times and i' I'd sleep through Bible readings and it didn't really uh you know you just it's it can be a lot of theologic the Theology and even though it might be taught with eloquence and your your your pastor might be not to knowing what he's talking about um um but to when when Revelation strikes when Revelation strikes that's what makes the difference when God reveals to you that Jesus is the Christ and that it is the blood that cleanses you and I tell you when when when Revelation struck when I when I met God for myself and and heard from God then it it changed my experience in church now I was interested in what the preacher was saying I I wasn't waiting for him to just fold up his papers and and getting real excited when he started closing his notes at knew the service was going to be ended it you you it makes you makes you want to hear more from God makes you want to hear about God because that's the thing that begins to feed you your appetite begins to change and see it that you know brother R would say over and over that Eve's problem was he just couldn't wait and that's our problem many times when we we we failed to wait on God to bring us the revelation of the thing and the spoken word is the Original Seed he said that's what's the matter with Pentecostal today they're manufacturing something they can't wait they just can't wait so they commit adultery tears to manufacture something and what does it bring forth like it did the first time the first bride that couldn't wait God promised to multiply them but they had to wait until God's time now see we we sometimes we we hear something maybe maybe that we don't understand and we try to rush and try to figure it out but if we'll just wait and let let God reveal it in his time and spoken word in in another quote he said Adam's bride could not wait God had told Adam and Eve multiply and replenish the Earth it was an oncoming thing a promise and in what hearest thou Elijah he said we don't have to worry you forget that there's a God we'll all stew up and think oh well if I can't do this if I can act like this and I can't join this keep still and wait for God to speak to you that's the thing oh if we can if we can take lessons from from some of the mistakes that the people that we read about just just instead of trying to hurry and trying to rush and manufacture something try to force something to happen just wait on God and God will reveal it and manifest it so in in Genesis 1 this is what he failed to wait on in Genesis 1:27 it says God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth so God had given a promise but she failed to wait to for God to come and interpret that promise what what does that promise mean you know when God reveals it he he'll he'll bring it to pass like uh you know uh when when Abel had a revelation God came on the scene and Vindicated that he had the correct Revelation by testifying of it by by accepting his sacrifice and you see Kan Kane could look at that situation and say well why did not why he he he knew that God didn't accept his sacrifice and Abel knew that he did accept his because God came and testified of it and Cain and Abel brought Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and Abel brought of the firstlings of his flock and the fat thereof and brother Brown will say now look at Cain in the Garden of Eden Cain when he come back to Eden he was just as religious as he could be he brought flowers and so forth and put them on the altar he brought the fruits of the field and laid them down he believed in God he worshiped God he sacrificed to God he built a church to God just as religious as he could be and Abel rolled him up a rock and made him a church or worship place in Genesis 2: 16 it says and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die and in Genesis 3:6 it says and the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves fig leaves together and made themselves aprons now brother BR would say in the message serpent seed now here I I've never had a preacher to agree with this yet and they try to make it some other way but yet it don't make sense to me they try to say that Adam and Eve eat some apples brother I don't say this for a joke now but I want to say it for if eating apples makes women realize they are naked we' better pass the apples again you know that's right you know eating an apple that wasn't what they did made them realize they were naked certainly it wasn't it had to come through sexually it had to be cuz they realized they were naked when they taken this this forbidden fruit ain't a woman a fruit tree ain't you the fruit of your mother that was the F fruit that was forbidden to be taken now last time we started looking at some of the uh Jewish tradition of of where what the Jews believed about this to kind of lay a foundation that this um this is something that uh this this is an original Doctrine now in John chapter 8 we know that Jesus was having this conversation with the Pharisees about um he he said I speak that that which I have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father so now they're they're see the Jew the the Jews relied so much on that lineage their genealogy they would keep such careful track of the genealogy because they believe that that is what gave them a right to the spiritual inheritance was their natural genealogy and they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus saith unto him if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham but now ye seek to kill me a man that ha told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham ye do the Deeds of your father then said they to him we be not born of fa fornication we have one father even God now there's a lot of different layers to this passage you could say they were attacking his birth and all of those kind of things but they were let's put this in the context of the of of their belief that they knew they knew that this the original story of what had happened in the garden so to to kind of prove that let's go back through some early early Jewish writings and and see now a lot of these things that I'm going to read um you know they're uh they were have dubious Theology and things but one com Common Thread through all of these is that they all made reference to the what happened in the Garden of Eden and that's really what I'm kind of calling out here and Louis Z Ginsburg in this wrote a kind of a summary of the in his book The Legends of the Jews and he said to summarize what they believe he said after the fall of Eve Satan in the guise of the serpent approached her and the fruit of their Union was Cain the ancestor of all the impious generations that were rebellious toward God and Rose up against him Cain's descent from Satan who is the Angel samel was revealed in his sfic appearance now samel samels and and the talmud all the Jewish commentaries they that's the name that they gave for the for the archangel that that's how they the the Jewish historians refer to him and um honestly I haven't done too much background in on where that came from and all that sort of thing but but that that is there and the um another book called The Gospel of James which is um one of the books that was written in the first century ad that was not included in the cannon of what the the Bible this is this is Joseph speaking in this book and he said I received her from the Temple of the Lord God as a virgin talking about Mary but I did not watch over her who has prayed upon me who has done this wicked deed in my home and defiled the Virgin has not the entire history of Adam been summed up in me for just as Adam was singing praise to God when the serpent came and found Eve alone and led her astray so too has this now happened to me so he's looking at his situation with Mary and now she's got a child and he's saying well now the same thing that happened in the garden is now happening to me and that's the story that they're relaying here in this in this book called The Gospel of James and in the in the book of mbes now if you know the mccabes were the is the the mccabes were the the group of people that um that uh revolted against the salusa dynasty um just before the coming of Christ and so these these four books were written about their their uh their their story and and in this book it tells of the mother of seven Martyrs that were seven sons that were martyred by Antiochus epiphanies and she her story is she says I was a pure virgin and did not go outside my father's house but I guarded the rib from which woman was made so she's going back she's referring back to that original story no Seducer corrupted me on a desert plane nor did the Destroyer the deceitful serpent defile the purity of my virginity so she's now she's appealing back to that original story uh knowing what happened in the garden that that that the serpent had something to do with the defiling of Eve's Virginia and you can read there's a reference there in uh the desert plain refers to the Superstition that demons were thought to wait for women in the desert where they could s seduce them so this whole if you put that in all the context of what she's saying there goes back to the the Jews original belief of original understanding of what really did happen in the Garden of Eden another another story is the uh johanan bar Napa was the is the is the fellow that the the brother that that compiled the Jerusalem talmud which a talmud is like a commentary on on the on the Bible it's like you know today when we read the Bible you can you read a commentary on it that kind from from Spurgeon or whoever that shares some insights on on the Bible that's kind of like what the town mood was and so this uh Johan and bar manapa was the U I may not be pronouncing that right but he is the one that is really responsible for riding the Jerusalem town and comp in all the thing the notes are in that and he says when the serpent copulated with Eve he infused her with lust and that's a pretty that's a pretty pretty uh telling statement about what the what the Jews believed that they they they that's what they believed um tertullian was I I think we're most of us many of us are familiar with tertullian was a prolific early Christian author from Carthage in the Roman province of Africa he was the first Christian Author to produce an extensive Corpus of Latin Christian literature and tulon said having been pregnant with the seed of the devil she brought forth a son talking about Eve so tertullian in the beginning in the early stages of the Christian church was aware of what happened in the garden this is another quote from from Jonathan from uh that Rabbi that compiled the Jerusalem town but he said Adam knew his wife Eve who had conceived from Semel the angel of the Lord so there's another Eve conceived from from Lucifer right she she listened to the devil's lie and then ad again he said Adam begot Seth who resembled him for before that Eve had born Cain who was not from him and who did not resemble him so there's he's he's referring back to now this is a this is a Jew that wrote all the commentary on on what the the Hebrew scriptures called the the the Jerusalem townwood and this is his commentary on what really happened in the Garden of Eden and the gospel of Phillip there's a uh it's supposedly written by someone named valentinus it says ver there was first there was adultery and then murder and he Cain was begotten in adultery because he was the son of the serpent because of this he became a murderer like his father too and he killed his brother Abel every partnership between those who are dissimilar is adultery and some more passages from the um the the life of Adam and Eve which is in its Greek version is this is it it's Greek let me tell yall how difficult it is to find these things that you can't even get the copy of this without paying online so you you have to go through a pay wall this is stuff that's that's it's hidden in the in the shadow people they it's not laying on the bookshelf at the bookstore the life of of Adam and Eve also known as this Greek version as The Apocalypse of Moses is is is a it's a it recounts the lives of Adam and Eve from after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden to their deaths and it provided this is this is a it's a Jewish book that was written and it was translated to Greek and then translated to Latin but it tells it's a commentary on what the Jews believed was the original story of what happened in the garden of enus as um and again you know like a lot of these a lot of these many of the things that the Jews wrote about um they they embellish and add all sorts of odd things but you you read it with the with the understanding that there's this Common Thread that's running through that they knew what happened in the garden right it provides more detail about the Fallen man including Eve's version of the story Satan explains that he rebelled when God commanded him to bow down to Adam and after Adam dies he and all his descendants are promised to Resurrection how about that so Eve speaking in this in this book uh she says the enemy who committed adultery with me does not love me and the Archangel to Adam says behold your son Cain because he is the son of the devil will slay Abel his brother Cain the son of the devil now see so you can see we we've uh We've read a lot of a lot of uh compelling evidence that this is not some new thing that came up um it's it's an original original belief that the Jews held from way back and um so in Proverbs 30:20 such as the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith I have done no wickedness in second Corinthians Paul's Paul's warning he said I'm jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as a serpent begal Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that in that is in Christ and you can see the original problem if you go and I I just want to encourage you maybe maybe when you when you have a moment go back and listen to that serpent seed message again because there's there's a lot of things that I can share with you in the little Sunday school lesson but there's if you sit there and meditate in the quietness of your home on the things that he's trying to and when you study it out do it like this a lot a lot of times we'll listen to a sermon and we'll we'll um we'll just kind of let it play in the background and really pay attention but when brother Bram he'll say something really compelling and then when he tells another story after that listen why did he tell that story what does that have to do with the rest of this sermon think about it like that so that the pieces begin to come together why why did why after he said this statement did he start talking about how all the denominational systems are teaching false Doctrine and how what's what what is the essence of what he's trying to communicate and brother Ram said in the spoken word in that message he he said that's how adultery is committed spiritually when you knowing better by the word of God by the Intercourse of the mind taking a lie of the devil against the word of God that's exactly what 've done with a spiritual intercourse first that come by believing Satan's lie into the womb of her mind that polluted her soul set death in the soul then the natural act taking place now look I got these these words bolded so you can see first first first you received in the womb of her mind and then the natural act taken place that's why I'm saying is as you go back and listen to that to consider why brother brandham hit so much in that sermon about how that the the denominations teach wrongly about how the right way to be baptized and the right way uh the the correct understanding of the godhead and all these things what because it matters what you believe it matters and that's the only way he said continuing on he said that's the the only way that a woman ever can commit adultery against her husband is to first let some man talk her into it first let some man talk her into it and tell her a good idea something seems like a good idea something off and then receive another man that's not her husband then she's committed adultery and when the Bride of Jesus Christ lets man-made Creeds and dogmas take the place of the word of God she is committing adultery and uh we'll we'll do one more slide and then we'll stop here brother R said there stood and I got a I got a picture here cuz it's really hard to find a picture of what of of any kind of simus of the Beast so this is kind of I guess a blending of what the the normal the chist the denominational world thinks of like a serpent crawling around but really the Beast was upright he had to be have a way to talk a serpent ain't going like a snake's not going to talk but if you're upright and you look like a man and uh uh you you can have a conversation with somebody and said brother R would say he said there stood Adam and Eve Eve a beautiful woman I can see there Adam with them dark Shaggy locks hanging around his head those bright flashy eyes look over to his little sweetheart Eve and such a be perfect perfect built woman and her hair looked up and her eyes as blue as the sky Adam loved her oh how he loved her but when sin entered in the little home was broke up because of an old lustful Beast the devil had got into an animal called The Serpent not a reptile remember the de the Bible doesn't say that the devil was a snake he wasn't a snake in the beginning the snake wasn't like he is now in the beginning the curse put him where he's at the Bible said he was he was not a reptile he was a beast and the most subtle of all the Beast of the field he looked more like a man than anything You' ever had walked upright there's where the devil got in him and come to Eve this beautiful maid woman and she did what was wrong and God bless she will stop right there and just finish next time
