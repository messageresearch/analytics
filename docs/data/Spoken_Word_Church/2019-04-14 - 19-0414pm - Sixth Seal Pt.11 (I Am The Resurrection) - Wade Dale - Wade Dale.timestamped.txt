[5:47] he's one of us been one of us for a long
[5:49] time so we all need prayer amen
[5:55] so while you got you Bibles let's turn
[5:59] to the Book of Revelations verse chapter
[6:01] 6 let's talk a little bit about the
[6:06] sixth seal maybe bring it to a close
[6:09] with one more thought and today we want
[6:13] to speak on I am the resurrection being
[6:17] next week will be the time that we
[6:22] celebrate the resurrection you know that
[6:26] we were talking a few weeks ago then
[6:30] most people can't get him off the cross
[6:32] well a lot of them can't get him out of
[6:34] the grave either I mean they just can't
[6:35] get him into their life so we pray that
[6:38] that if this message has shown us
[6:42] nothing else is even that's six seals
[6:44] showing us that it's costing you the
[6:46] hope of glory he decided that this is
[6:49] the way it's going to be and this is the
[6:51] way it is and we must conform to his how
[6:55] can the Potter say to the clay you
[6:56] should have done it a different way you
[6:59] can't do that the Potter it has all full
[7:01] control but you know end that the in
[7:04] that the Potter has full control he
[7:06] knows what the pots gonna look like and
[7:08] man this one does this Potter knows
[7:10] exactly what he's looking for and he
[7:12] found it in the bride of Jesus Christ in
[7:15] the end time so let's bow our heads
[7:16] before we get started

[7:32] her strength too let's bow our heads the

[7:39] more day in the purchase of your blood
[7:41] Lord to be here among a group of people
[7:44] that loves your father that wants to
[7:46] hear more from you Lord that that begs
[7:49] for revelation more than anything Lord
[7:51] there is father we pray that you would
[7:54] grant that now as being the active

[9:01] strength also father just bless us today
[9:03] Lord in this continuation of this
[9:05] service in Jesus name we pray amen
[9:08] alright 60a Romans 6 verse 12 we're
[9:13] going to bring in one little thought
[9:14] that I kind of yesterday was yesterday
[9:18] was a struggle I am working two people's
[9:21] jobs for the last few days and sometimes
[9:25] your mind gets a little foggy but at
[9:27] least I got one
[9:29] so thank you all right that's it right
[9:33] and I've been and but you know why
[9:36] sometimes though when you sit there and
[9:38] the numbness of your brain you get a
[9:40] thought because you're not thinking
[9:42] about nothing else you can't get nothing
[9:44] to come up and then all of a sudden God
[9:46] goes you know stick this in there
[9:49] somewhere so I think we will so today
[9:51] we're gonna speak about I am the
[9:53] resurrection but we're also good I want
[9:54] you to keep in the back of your mind the
[9:56] word omnipotence the word omnipotence
[10:00] which is all powerful and I beheld when
[10:04] he had opened the sixth seal and lo
[10:05] there was a great earthquake and Sun
[10:06] became black as sackcloth of hair and
[10:08] the moon became his blood
[10:09] stars of heaven fell upon the earth even
[10:12] as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs
[10:14] when she is shaken of a mighty wind and
[10:16] they have been departed as a scroll when
[10:17] it is rolled together and every mountain
[10:19] and every island was moved out of their
[10:20] place and the kings of the earth and the
[10:22] great men and the rich men the chief
[10:24] captains in the mighty men and every
[10:25] bondman and every free man hid
[10:26] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[10:28] of the mountains and said to the
[10:30] mountains and rocks fall on us and hide
[10:32] us from the face of him that sitteth on
[10:33] the throne looks like they have no hope
[10:36] they don't for the wrath of the lamb for
[10:41] the great day of his wrath has come and
[10:44] who shall be able to stand you may be
[10:46] seated
[10:46] I was thinking yesterday too they we've
[10:49] been kind of running around this point
[10:52] and the point is that this has all
[10:57] happened because we're gone we kind of
[11:00] touched on it the other day but whatever
[11:03] is going on here is an is an event that
[11:06] cannot happen while we're here that
[11:08] scripture cannot be fulfilled until the
[11:11] bride of Jesus Christ leaves the earth
[11:13] so you and I are holding off that part
[11:16] of that wrath but listen have you ever
[11:18] thought of this though when we come to a
[11:20] place that we have a body change and
[11:24] that death is destroyed on into very may
[11:28] I say the death hole of the universe
[11:31] this is the death hole of the universe
[11:33] there's no death on Mars or on Venus
[11:35] that is in the earth there's death here
[11:37] because this is where man fell but think
[11:40] about it though you and eyes
[11:42] being that we come to a body change
[11:44] think of how the earth is gonna react to
[11:46] this
[11:47] that's how the earth is going to react
[11:49] to this that's how the natural earth is
[11:51] going to react when a bride stands on
[11:53] the earth with a glorified body the dead
[11:57] Saints have already come out of the
[11:59] ground they've got their glorified body
[12:01] our bodies changed we get ready to step
[12:03] into another dimension and when we step
[12:05] into another dimension all hell's gonna
[12:07] break loose
[12:08] because we're gone because we come to a
[12:13] place we come to a position that's why
[12:14] this six seal right before the seventh
[12:17] opens it's right perfect in place which
[12:19] we know it is but then I get to see more
[12:21] and more how that it is more in place
[12:23] that you and I have a lot to do with
[12:26] this sixth seal it will not open cannot
[12:28] open until we're gone it's barred
[12:32] there's no way it cannot happen until
[12:34] the bride of Jesus Christ leave the
[12:36] earth go into another dimension
[12:38] we've already took a body change I was
[12:40] staying talking about this morning we're
[12:42] talking about in Hebrews about
[12:44] Melchizedek Melchizedek female Kansa it
[12:47] was not your Savior that flesh male
[12:50] candidate when when God I like to say it
[12:54] this way when God slow down enough to
[12:56] come into this dimension because
[12:58] remember brother Brahim said the
[12:59] dimensions are faster that's why there's
[13:01] other dimensions called there faster
[13:03] dimension when God slowed down and come
[13:05] into this dimension he put a body of
[13:08] sixteen element flesh on talk to Abraham
[13:10] now he didn't take that back into the
[13:13] dimension that he came from no note that
[13:16] the off any man went back in there now I
[13:19] would say when he went through that
[13:21] curtain and got a lot faster that that
[13:23] flesh just melted back down into the
[13:25] earth
[13:26] but now when Jesus Christ when Jesus
[13:30] Christ went up into another dimension he
[13:33] took that flesh with it because that's
[13:35] your example in my example he is
[13:39] standing in another dimension faster
[13:41] than this one with a glorified flesh
[13:44] body amen so that's our example that you
[13:48] and I are not going to step through now
[13:50] sure when natural death comes you step
[13:53] through into a faster
[13:55] mentioned what happens you have to lead
[13:57] the flesh here alright you have to lead
[14:00] the flesh here no man on earth has took
[14:03] his flesh with him into another
[14:04] dimension your theophany goes in another
[14:07] dimension and your body goes into the
[14:08] earth but when you step back into here
[14:10] it's all gonna meet right back together
[14:12] that is redemption not replacement a man
[14:16] that is redemption well the hell how you
[14:22] doing you good good to see buddy good to
[14:26] see you brother hell with us you not
[14:29] been feeling too good he's feeling
[14:30] better now looking good anyway can
[14:33] hardly see him behind brother John but
[14:37] in John 11 verse 23 let's pull it up we
[14:40] were talking here about the resurrection
[14:41] let's let's talk about that just a
[14:44] minute Jesus said unto her thy brother
[14:45] shall rise again well now he's he's true
[14:52] in two points he's fixing to raise him
[14:56] up but he's gonna rise again in the
[14:58] resurrection because remember Lazarus
[15:01] died and he's gonna have to be
[15:04] resurrected a man Jesus resurrected him
[15:07] temporary but you and I get a temporary
[15:10] resurrection we've seen people raised
[15:12] from the dead well that's temporary that
[15:14] person is going to die again but not
[15:17] when we come to this resurrection when
[15:19] we come to this resurrection that we're
[15:21] talking about death has been destroyed
[15:23] there is no other death we've already
[15:26] died we're dead in Christ the dead in
[15:30] Christ shall rise first Martha said unto
[15:32] him I know he shall rise again in the
[15:34] resurrection at the last day we're at
[15:37] the last day she's talking about here
[15:38] jesus said unto her I am standing here
[15:43] ever-present right now I am the
[15:46] resurrection he didn't finish that he
[15:48] said I am the life so whatever life you
[15:52] lose Christ is gonna bring you back you
[15:56] say well we you know we die what we do
[15:58] we lose our life on Earth but that life
[16:00] doesn't end it goes into another
[16:01] dimension but I promise you one thing
[16:03] God is gonna call it back
[16:05] God's gonna call it back into this
[16:07] dimension through who I am
[16:13] thank you you'll learn in a minute hey
[16:16] don't get sleepy on me today y'all and
[16:17] had cake lucky where it did last week
[16:19] I am the resurrection and the life he
[16:22] that believeth in me not only in me
[16:29] though he were dead now how in the world
[16:35] how in the world are you gonna be de I
[16:38] didn't believe on him in him that's what
[16:42] he just said he that believeth in me
[16:45] though he were dead yet shall he live
[16:50] there's got to be somebody alive to
[16:53] believe for those that went on because
[16:56] if you're going on you're believing is
[16:58] over I don't believe I'm going to 6
[17:02] dimension I'm standing in it if I go by
[17:05] the grave amen but there's somebody here
[17:08] this kind of believing him though he
[17:10] were dead yet shall he live he was
[17:13] trying to get Martha to believe like he
[17:16] believed amen and whosoever liveth and
[17:20] believeth in me shall never die
[17:24] believe us now this I mean you've got to
[17:28] believe that I was telling the Sunday
[17:31] school this morning it's just lies in
[17:34] our believing it lies in our believing
[17:38] we have we got all the message we got
[17:40] seals are open we got all these things
[17:42] it lays in us believing what's already
[17:45] been said about us amen and I think
[17:48] we're beginning to do that we're
[17:49] beginning to see that we have been in
[17:51] our own mind we have separated ourselves
[17:54] and we become like tunas you know we
[17:56] face us in Christ over there somewhere
[17:58] else you know no it's not it's not you
[18:03] in Christ it's Christ
[18:06] in you the hope of glory all right so
[18:11] let's read the six let's read this now I
[18:13] tell you what I did for some of you that
[18:15] got them quote they ran me off one and
[18:18] I'm garbled the numbers up but when they
[18:22] ran another one off we need to get some
[18:25] ink because it was all messed up and
[18:27] when I started writing it off he
[18:28] couldn't read it so anyway our I ran my
[18:30] copy off and just go by the quotes I'm
[18:34] not gonna skip them just go one two
[18:35] three all right so this is obviously
[18:38] number one now what we're talking about
[18:40] the other week we know that this sixth
[18:42] seal is the judgment seal it's the
[18:45] judgment seal now look that's what I
[18:47] mean about you and I have already been
[18:48] judged my judgment lies in Christ my
[18:53] judgment lies in what he's done my
[18:56] judgment even lies in to here standing
[18:58] in a glorified body in another dimension
[18:59] waiting on me because you know what that
[19:02] man over there in that seventh dimension
[19:05] called Jesus Christ with a glorified
[19:07] body it's not going to come back here
[19:10] until the Millenium all this is done
[19:13] without him being on earth in his human
[19:17] mortal immortal body because you're his
[19:21] body he's going to do it through you
[19:27] this is this judgment seal and remember
[19:32] the whole world is going to be judged by
[19:34] us we're even judging angels this what
[19:38] world is judged by you by the seven
[19:41] churches group from the day of Pentecost
[19:45] till the day we walk out of here when we
[19:47] go to the white throne judgment to judge
[19:50] not in judgment the people that will on
[19:53] earth will be judged by you and Paul's
[19:58] age and Irena San Martin you know why
[20:00] because it's gotten human flesh Thrones
[20:04] we're going to be in Thrones at the
[20:06] white throne judgment we're going to be
[20:08] there not standing down there standing
[20:11] up here judging the whole world I read
[20:15] you that scripture a long time ago where
[20:17] the Saints will even judge a
[20:20] Jules we're not even supposed to take
[20:22] our brother to court now that doesn't
[20:24] mean somebody's not a brother so don't
[20:25] get me wrong but you're not supposed to
[20:27] take a brother of the court you know
[20:28] where you supposed to judge things if
[20:29] your church member Church group not
[20:31] member church group you're supposed to
[20:34] do all your judging in this building
[20:36] right here that's what the Bible says
[20:39] take the judgment not out to the world
[20:42] because you know what they will not
[20:43] understand some things that we
[20:45] understand amen but now somebody else
[20:47] that's a different story but a brother
[20:48] should never take a brother of the court
[20:50] that's absolutely wrong all right and if
[20:54] you can't get it settled here there's an
[20:58] alford up here for one of you to get
[21:01] safe or both of you or all of you amen
[21:06] but here's the breaking fourth of the
[21:08] judgment upon the people we're out of
[21:10] the tribulation judgment will come forth
[21:12] 144,000 redeemed you sly brother Dale
[21:14] said this morning everybody has to die
[21:16] except the bride now some of the brides
[21:19] have going on but everybody there's got
[21:21] to be a group of bride that will not die
[21:25] to fulfill the scripture so somebody
[21:27] it's gonna happen to and don't worry
[21:30] Abraham was ninety and nine so age
[21:34] doesn't have anything to do with it okay
[21:36] Abraham was ninety nine when he got to
[21:38] change all right so this has nothing to
[21:42] do with the bride remember we're already
[21:44] gone we don't see the bride's gone can't
[21:47] place us anywhere else
[21:48] setback in the nineteenth chapter of the
[21:51] book of that's revelations not Act
[21:52] notice for the sixth seal is the
[21:54] judgment seal of the word everybody got
[21:57] that you should I've read it for eleven
[21:59] weeks in the room all right now number
[22:02] two we'll get real quick to this pull up
[22:05] number two now we find out also in this
[22:10] that the sixth seal now open in a
[22:11] three-fold purpose now look the sixth
[22:13] seal open in a threefold manner and so
[22:15] did the seventh seal open in three full
[22:17] matter when we get to the seventh seal
[22:19] we're going to see that it open in the
[22:21] threefold manner also then we go back to
[22:23] Christ the mystery God revealed in that
[22:25] opened in a three-fold matter so you see
[22:27] there's a three-fold purpose for these
[22:29] last few ones I'm telling you we talked
[22:32] about this how
[22:34] or to each seal is as I get into each
[22:36] one I see the net the one that one's
[22:38] important and then when I we leave the
[22:40] fifth seal I said man then can't nothing
[22:42] be no more important than the fifth seal
[22:43] when I get in a sixth seal well that
[22:46] becomes more important than the fifth
[22:47] seal so you just keep you God just keeps
[22:48] bringing things out you know because the
[22:51] sixth seal being the judgment sealed and
[22:52] all judgments done under that seal all
[22:54] judgment because remember when we go to
[22:57] the white throne judgment it will be
[22:58] judged what's on this earth and then and
[23:02] that will happen during this time
[23:04] listen the bride is gone everybody else
[23:09] has to die naturally physically die and
[23:12] some have to stay dead for a thousand
[23:15] years amen even the foolish virgin even
[23:19] the cup of water in my name they have to
[23:21] be dead for a thousand years before the
[23:23] white throne judgment okay but now you
[23:26] and I do not but being this sixth seal
[23:28] is open it's open because it's a
[23:32] judgment seal but it also is a purging
[23:34] seal what does judgment do judgment
[23:36] purges out the wrong what judgment do it
[23:39] when you judge something you judge the
[23:41] wrong and it purges it out or as we say
[23:44] in modern times you come before a judge
[23:47] and he sentences you to incarceration or
[23:51] freedom same thing with this judgment is
[23:54] the same thing incarceration or freedom
[23:56] all right that's why brother Branham
[23:58] said he said when you come to them doors
[24:00] every church service you either get what
[24:02] better or worse why because you judge
[24:06] judgment it begins in the house of God
[24:08] you're either gonna get worse and take
[24:11] back out that door what you brought in
[24:13] knowing you should have got rid of it
[24:14] are you gonna get rid of it in here and
[24:17] be happy when you go outside okay so
[24:19] that's what the judgment is and it is
[24:21] this is the judgment is for purification
[24:24] that's what judgment is it purifies
[24:26] everything it puts all the bad guys in
[24:29] prison and supposedly if it worked well
[24:31] puts all the bad guys in prison and all
[24:33] the good guys get to work get freedom it
[24:35] purges the bad stuff so that's what he's
[24:38] doing with us he's doing that in this
[24:40] sixth seal sanctification he's purging
[24:43] us completely out and taking us in a
[24:45] rapture
[24:47] it's for a three-fold purpose now here
[24:49] was the purposes the first name the
[24:51] sleeping virgin had to go through the
[24:52] tribulation for purification she had to
[24:56] be purged of her sins of unbelief and
[24:57] rejecting the message this she was done
[25:00] in the tribulation period we see they
[25:02] wind up over here in Revelation 7
[25:05] between the 6th and 7th chapter that she
[25:07] had been purged she had been given her
[25:09] robes now she's not the bride
[25:11] but it's the church two pure people that
[25:13] that didn't have the opportunity to
[25:15] receive the message or in some way they
[25:17] were blinded by these false prophets we
[25:19] see that happening now and they didn't
[25:21] get a chance and yet they're really
[25:23] sincere in heart because you know what
[25:25] God does know the heart God knows your
[25:27] heart he knows your heart right now he
[25:29] knows what's going on he knows what's
[25:30] going on with your heart so he knew they
[25:33] would be sincere in heart and hear their
[25:36] purge during this time you notice that
[25:38] another purging that's for Israel when
[25:40] she's gathering that's the second fold
[25:42] God purges Israel in the Tribulation
[25:44] Period out of the millions that are
[25:46] gather there there'll be a select
[25:48] 144,000 and they will be purged also God
[25:51] purging Israel why he's purging Israel
[25:55] so he can take her in the 144,000 has
[25:58] got to be purged they got to die before
[26:00] they can go over into another dimension
[26:02] because when God wipes this thing off
[26:04] like brother Dale so much the Battle of
[26:06] Armageddon this man pushing buttons it's
[26:08] all it's an atomic war all right but
[26:11] we're not gonna be here for this virgin
[26:15] is actually going to be in the ground
[26:16] also so it is 144,000 you're under
[26:19] sentence you know what I'm saying saying
[26:20] ground but they're not gonna be in this
[26:21] dimension the millions of new looking at
[26:24] the minute of them you see what it is
[26:27] God's purging Israel now watch now
[26:29] there's a whole earth to be purged
[26:32] there'll be such a thing that the moon
[26:34] stars in all nature will be purged you
[26:36] see what it is the earth is renewing
[26:38] herself being purged getting ready for
[26:41] the Millennium the millenniums coming up
[26:44] and see everything that's got any filth
[26:46] in it is to be purged during the sixth
[26:49] seal so the sixth seal is your purging
[26:52] seal and that's the same thing with you
[26:53] and I because you know what death has
[26:55] got to be purged out of us
[26:58] death itself the little thing that we
[27:01] always have that problem with that
[27:02] little dark thing called death that
[27:04] we're all heading toward it's got to be
[27:07] purged out of us to where it does not
[27:08] bother us anymore okay
[27:11] done all right say man that's all right
[27:14] with me I'm telling you I hate funeral I
[27:18] don't like them you know why I just
[27:22] don't this is the separation in there
[27:24] you know all right let's go to the next
[27:27] one now let's talk about this just for a
[27:28] second what we've been talking about the
[27:30] fifth seal we saw was justification
[27:31] which would be the highest form of
[27:33] justification God given eternal life to
[27:36] a group of people that didn't even want
[27:37] it what about grapes that's the greatest
[27:39] grave still there is right there and
[27:41] that's the greatest great seal that
[27:43] you're sitting here today that you
[27:45] weren't in Wesley's Asian Luther's age
[27:47] and Pentecost age some of you came out
[27:49] of that penticoff stage that's all right
[27:51] I'm glad you came out
[27:53] amen because you look at this now at the
[27:58] sixth seal what is sanctification
[28:00] cleaned and set aside for service now
[28:03] listen we've already been put in service
[28:05] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[28:08] we've already been put in service we
[28:10] have eternal life in our soul we've been
[28:12] put in service but God wants to use you
[28:14] more he doesn't want you to be a baby
[28:17] but we were talking about downstairs in
[28:20] Hebrews chapter 5 he said Paul says the
[28:23] reason you can't understand these things
[28:24] because your babies you drink milk he
[28:28] said but strong meat is for those that
[28:30] are mature that's why we want to be a
[28:32] mature church you know why because when
[28:34] that Holy Ghost and fire falls we'll
[28:36] know how to use that power without
[28:40] character is what satanic but power with
[28:44] character it's fit to rule and then so
[28:48] when we see that the listen it's God in
[28:51] you it's God the Holy Ghost in fire
[28:58] comes in and burns that old nature well
[29:00] you know what it's doing it's burning
[29:02] the rest of it out he killed the old man
[29:06] I hope he did you can't be married to
[29:10] Christ and have two husbands
[29:11] hey man so if you're all if you're born
[29:14] again today your old man's dead and
[29:16] you're married to Christ but then as you
[29:19] married to Christ you are a bride but he
[29:22] doesn't want just a bride
[29:24] I've been married 40 years to June she's
[29:26] my wife now it's so scary she's
[29:30] beginning to thing like me
[29:33] Louise she's beginning to thing like me
[29:38] she said something other day and I said
[29:40] that's something might've said let y'all
[29:43] pray for she is him but listen as as
[29:49] we're down here though to understand how
[29:52] Christ in the bride is one you look at
[29:55] your bride and see that you're one amen
[29:59] that's our example but she is him now
[30:02] remember we come to the Seventh Seal
[30:05] which would be when I get back to be a
[30:07] little bit later on that's Holy Ghost
[30:08] and fire comes and burns and you're
[30:14] gonna have to be go with me there for a
[30:16] little while because we're not gonna
[30:17] we're going to back out of it because we
[30:18] still got to be under sanctification
[30:19] because when we come to sanctification
[30:21] that's cleaned and set aside for service
[30:24] alright he's setting us aside we were
[30:27] talking I'm we'll read it today about
[30:29] adoption and about the mechanics and
[30:31] dynamics we got the mechanics we need to
[30:35] dynamics we got one we got to have the
[30:37] other we got to have the Holy Ghost and
[30:39] fire but we got to look at this
[30:40] sanctification as you and I are set
[30:43] aside for not just any service as we
[30:47] were during our sanctification time when
[30:51] we were got first got saved then we got
[30:54] sanctified what God cleaned them the jar
[30:59] up and said it cleaned it and set aside
[31:01] for service then he filled it with the
[31:03] Holy Ghost now look we get many
[31:05] refilling as a Christian all right but
[31:09] this last one is going to be a refilling
[31:11] that doesn't have to be filled anymore
[31:13] your whole cups gonna be full your
[31:16] saucer is gonna run over your spoons
[31:18] gonna fall out your bowl whatever he
[31:20] says
[31:23] I don't throw you so your spoon fell out
[31:25] your bow amen some people have little
[31:28] bitty bowls some people have big ones
[31:30] amen but that's what that Holy Ghost in
[31:33] fire will do it's you know what it's
[31:35] going to do it's going to change your
[31:36] atoms it's going to change you into a
[31:38] glorified body it's not gonna throw this
[31:41] one away worth somebody literally is
[31:43] gonna stand on this earth and just your
[31:49] body is gonna be change you're gonna
[31:50] just absolutely drop right back to a 20
[31:52] year old person it's going to
[31:54] materialize right where you're standing
[31:55] I don't stir you sow your shovels fell
[32:02] out of your home or you ditch or
[32:03] wherever it is it's a shovel maybe I'll
[32:09] do that every once in a while to keep
[32:10] you all the way okay I mean we need a
[32:15] backhoe for some of this stuff you are
[32:17] me
[32:18] but we got to remember though that we
[32:20] are we have got to remember God didn't
[32:24] come on this earth to separate us God
[32:28] came on this earth as a human to bring
[32:30] us back together
[32:31] amen to bring us back to the brother
[32:35] Dale to somebody this morning mm-hmm you
[32:37] look and see God when God was standing
[32:40] in the Garden of Eden that's what was
[32:42] somebody we don't want to go back to the
[32:43] Garden of Eden where they're still the
[32:45] devil that where there's a obese there
[32:47] we don't won't go back to that part of
[32:49] the Garden of Eden because that was in
[32:50] the Garden of Eden the beast was in the
[32:51] Garden of Eden so I mean Satan was there
[32:53] and then we want to go past that we want
[32:58] to go back into the side of our maker
[33:00] into that Genesis 1:26 man amen and
[33:04] that's where we want to reside in the
[33:06] Garden of Eden because when God stood in
[33:08] the Garden of Eden there stood Adam and
[33:11] then there come Eva
[33:13] that was one person that was one
[33:18] individual person flesh of his flesh
[33:21] bone of his bone that's what's going to
[33:25] step on this earth believe it's dialed
[33:29] this number three but that we got
[33:34] justification and sanctification is
[33:36] clean and set aside he
[33:37] has cleaned us to sleep it right there
[33:38] he has cleaned us up during the church
[33:40] ages and sent us a prophet in the end
[33:43] time to tell us what our purpose is
[33:45] remember cleaned and set aside for a
[33:47] purpose brother I believe God sent
[33:50] brother Branham to tell us not how to
[33:53] live right brother Branham this message
[33:57] don't save you this message will kill
[34:02] you if you're not born again so quit
[34:06] worrying about being in the message get
[34:08] in Christ he'll put you in the message
[34:11] he'll put that message inside of you
[34:14] because remember they're one but don't
[34:16] think you got to know this message and
[34:18] this message this message this message
[34:19] this message wasn't sent to get us born
[34:21] again
[34:25] it wasn't people's been born again since
[34:28] Paul's age so God sent a prophet to tell
[34:33] us who we are
[34:36] that God's not up there somewhere God's
[34:38] not out there somewhere God's not in a
[34:40] in a Cree or a Dogma or religion he's a
[34:45] person he's a man and he's inside of you
[34:48] if you're born again and break down oh
[34:52] break the seals what you think he just
[34:54] broke up on paper the seals broken flesh
[34:59] that's where that break it is in flesh
[35:01] my flesh your flesh that's where they
[35:05] break it's not some physical pulling of
[35:07] a seal back reading something on a piece
[35:09] of paper you are written epistle you are
[35:12] the one that God broke the seal - you
[35:14] are the seal grieve not the Holy Spirit
[35:17] of God whereby ye are sealed unto the
[35:19] day of your Redemption you're the seal
[35:27] don't know where that came from but
[35:31] that's what sanctification is clean and
[35:33] set aside for a purpose so you believe
[35:37] on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt
[35:39] be safe okay didn't you come to be born
[35:43] again by knowing Christ you don't become
[35:45] boring in by knowing the message I'm
[35:48] just telling you the truth
[35:51] this message was sent for a purpose but
[35:56] with man what had happened remember this
[35:58] the message of Elijah is a message of
[36:01] restoration and then a message of
[36:04] restoration he restored Malachi for
[36:07] restore back what the faith of the
[36:10] fathers the faith of the fathers they
[36:12] got born again under the 120 the up room
[36:16] got born again and didn't know who
[36:18] William Branham was Iranians nobody they
[36:22] never knew so listen don't worry about I
[36:24] know the message or I don't know the
[36:27] message no the one who wrote it get to
[36:31] know Christ get to do what Christ said
[36:33] to do brother Brown didn't tell you
[36:36] women not to cut your hair the Bible
[36:38] tells you that so if you're denying if
[36:40] you're denying it you're not denying a
[36:42] man you're denying God don't put it on a
[36:46] man and then if we drink smoking cuts
[36:51] you know what the Bible tells us not to
[36:53] do that brother Adam had to come back to
[36:57] build that back up to a place to where
[37:01] God could speak to us further to work I
[37:04] said where he can speak to us further he
[37:06] could give us a purpose for being here
[37:08] and then our purpose for being here as a
[37:12] body change there is no other
[37:13] denomination there I'm sorry there's no
[37:16] other church age there's no other church
[37:20] age messenger it's either us or nothing
[37:23] this is the life this is it
[37:26] coca-cola's not it this is it this is it
[37:33] there's nothing else left if we don't
[37:36] get this if we can't throw it to
[37:39] somebody else but so I know now we're up
[37:42] against the wall somebody will get it
[37:45] somebody and who's gonna get it oh boy
[37:49] we good but that's what it is there's
[37:52] Christ in you the hope of glory then
[37:55] you'll start learning the message listen
[37:57] I read this message who was it where
[38:00] were we was it Anna
[38:03] did you ask me that question in Bible
[38:05] study yes Hannah come on Anna sorry
[38:08] Muruga and I'm going to ask me a
[38:12] question now you know my background I
[38:14] grew up in this church from 1971
[38:17] actually from 1968 I was 8 years old
[38:20] mm-hmm and then I grew up in the message
[38:24] and then I studied the message I said
[38:25] here and you know what I had the ability
[38:27] to read I was a smart kid sorry I was
[38:30] the other ones are a little different
[38:32] but they were they were they were harder
[38:34] but but I taught them all I need now
[38:38] left but no listen not being funny I
[38:43] read the message of the hour
[38:45] I understood the major doctrines they
[38:48] were not hard for me to understand even
[38:50] at a fourteen-year-old kid but I'll
[38:52] promise you one thing I'll promise you I
[38:54] wasn't born again I might have been
[38:57] saved I might have just got God to
[38:58] forgive me of my sins one day when I
[39:00] came up here the pulpit was what used to
[39:02] be right here the pulpit was right here
[39:04] and the piano was right there that was a
[39:06] wall it was a little room went back by
[39:08] where Tony's that and then the row of
[39:10] seats went like this and the front door
[39:12] was right there anybody got that so I I
[39:17] came up and I I I cried I asked God to
[39:22] forgive me of my sins but you know what
[39:23] I did I didn't go any further but what I
[39:26] done though I packed this in by the
[39:30] letter by the letter brother Tom folks
[39:34] got a lot of my books I think they still
[39:35] got some of them where you could see
[39:38] where I wouldn't make knows and a 14
[39:39] year old boy and I was a born again I
[39:42] proved that for about 19 years let's
[39:47] think about this morning you know I've
[39:49] even got my house number brother Joe in
[39:52] my future home you know your house
[39:55] number my house number is zero seven one
[40:00] nine nine eight because that's the month
[40:03] and the year I got born again July 1998
[40:07] I got born again but yes sister Ana I
[40:10] went through all them years no one the
[40:12] message was right I could sit here and
[40:13] read and tell you exactly what it was so
[40:16] it's not the man
[40:16] she's just gonna save you the letter of
[40:19] it know when I came to the altar in
[40:21] December of 1997 stood right here I gave
[40:25] my heart to God and I started reading
[40:27] the Bible the Bible not the message I
[40:31] had already read the message that I was
[40:33] reading the Bible to see where I needed
[40:37] Christ in my life and then six or eight
[40:40] months later I got the new birth in July
[40:43] of 1998 and then you know what all that
[40:50] started hitting on all the cylinders it
[40:52] wasn't just that it was sex in the
[40:54] garden now the serpent seeds standing
[40:56] here today not me but it is here hey man
[41:00] the seed of the serpent how'd you get
[41:01] here physically okay
[41:05] so it's still here see what I'm saying
[41:07] but now by the grace of God I'm telling
[41:09] you by the grace of God my walk in life
[41:11] was that I went through all those years
[41:13] knowing in the very back part of my mind
[41:15] there was a seed planted it was the word
[41:18] it had to be quickened though for it to
[41:20] do any good so it didn't when I came up
[41:23] in gave my heart to God it didn't
[41:25] quicken the word immediately you have to
[41:28] go through a process of justification
[41:30] sanctification he sanctified me cuz I
[41:35] got baptized in January it was cold I
[41:38] got baptized in January of 1998 and when
[41:42] I come out of that water I felt so empty
[41:45] I stood there in hook gym for blo 15
[41:49] minutes I guess just crying like a baby
[41:51] but when I when I let go of her my whole
[41:55] insides was like it rest like there was
[41:59] nothing in me sanctified cleaned and set
[42:03] aside for service well you know what I
[42:06] didn't say I got it I knew that I had to
[42:10] continue going up until July we were at
[42:14] Lake Malone in Kentucky on a vacation
[42:19] with June's parents a lot of them were
[42:23] heathens
[42:24] I mean raw heathen
[42:28] and here I was sitting in the motorhome
[42:31] reading a message and I can't remember
[42:33] what the nothing what the message was
[42:35] sorry I can't
[42:36] but there was an emotion came over me
[42:38] not of crying not of weeping and sobbing
[42:42] but an emotion came over me of power
[42:47] something came to me and when I have to
[42:49] look back down and started reading I
[42:51] just raised my hand to God I said thank
[42:52] you finally it's over
[42:54] you got to come to that to say finally
[42:58] it's over and then you come to rest but
[43:00] you don't rest no you can run outside
[43:03] and jump in the lake you know do
[43:05] something you know dude then you can
[43:07] have some emotion but it was just a
[43:09] feeling of power not it not that I could
[43:12] pick the motorhome up but just something
[43:14] came upon me that said hey this is it so
[43:18] see that was a new birth but you know
[43:19] what every time I open this book and
[43:22] every time I study the message and every
[43:24] time I read the Bible I get that same
[43:26] power I get that same confidence my
[43:30] heavens if God Almighty is your father
[43:33] and he's living inside of you you should
[43:35] have confidence you should walk out into
[43:38] this world and say I'm a son and
[43:44] daughter of God but I walk never stops
[43:48] it continues oh sure we all fall and we
[43:51] get up we follow we get up that's part
[43:56] of being a Christian listen if God don't
[43:59] chastise you you're a bastard child
[44:00] anyway you're not even his so don't
[44:03] worry things will happen I never want to
[44:07] see it none you think boy when you get
[44:10] the new birth and you start coming back
[44:11] to church boy you you know you're gonna
[44:12] be no I was the sickest you know daddy

[44:24] tell you about in private weird stuff
[44:27] weird stuff weird I mean where'd you go
[44:32] where did that come from but you know
[44:35] what it was God turning the devil loose
[44:38] on me
[44:41] just like he did job said well you can't
[44:43] touch your soul you can't touch his life
[44:46] but you sure can't do what you need to
[44:48] do because you know what that's my boy
[44:49] that's my child that's my son that's my
[44:52] daughter same thing with you I'm not
[44:53] saying anything to make me I'm just up
[44:55] here to tell you that your walk should
[44:57] be pretty close to that if you're not
[45:00] you're missing something if you don't
[45:03] you know they sometimes like brother
[45:05] Gary actions sometimes you know he says
[45:06] God speak to you he said three months
[45:08] four months God don't say a word but you
[45:11] know what it's child training it's child
[45:15] training I mean if every time I got in
[45:18] trouble I run to Daddy and daddy would
[45:20] just give me you know here's a thousand
[45:22] dollars so don't take care of your
[45:23] problem well you know what I be a small
[45:25] bright but when I was looking for my
[45:28] father I couldn't find him my natural
[45:32] father
[45:32] it was the heavenly fathers who I had to
[45:35] look for so when you look for your
[45:38] heavenly father when you start having
[45:39] problems don't start calling people
[45:41] honest where we get to that priest thing
[45:43] you know call the priest he'll take care
[45:45] of it no call you daddy
[45:49] how long died got going Savior so anyway
[45:54] mama tried to save me for 20 years
[45:57] she did a good job but she's not the
[46:00] Savior but mothers do that because
[46:04] they're wired different jinns the same
[46:06] way she tries to save all our kids but
[46:08] that's okay I mean that's just a mother
[46:10] part I'm not saying anything bad about
[46:12] it I'm just saying God has to do the
[46:14] work you can't mama can't daddy can't
[46:18] you must do the work God must do the
[46:22] work in you and through you alright so
[46:25] now that we've got all that done where
[46:26] were we but remember those are clean and
[46:31] set aside for service you already went
[46:32] through that one time when God brought
[46:34] you for a purpose to the place now it's
[46:37] see now look I'm gonna tell you
[46:38] something and we'll tell you something
[46:43] when I come and gave my heart to God now
[46:49] remember they certain things you still
[46:51] gonna have problems with specially under
[46:52] justification cuz the unclean spirit
[46:54] hadn't won out yet
[46:55] so be careful don't worry about that but
[46:58] see you got a step over into
[47:00] sanctification where after I was
[47:01] baptized in the name of Lord Jesus
[47:03] Christ that God when I come out of that
[47:06] water I felt a cleansing process the
[47:09] things I needed or wanted just totally
[47:12] went away most of you know I chewed
[47:15] tobacco every day of my life every day
[47:17] from 14 years old till that day I got
[47:19] saved and then God took it away just
[47:22] like a light switch and you know as well
[47:24] as I do some of you fought the
[47:25] cigarettes and at the back and you fight
[47:27] different things now listen there's
[47:29] other things I fought don't think I'm
[47:30] perfect there's other things I fought
[47:31] still fighting right there's things I
[47:35] fought though that there's things that I
[47:37] didn't there's things you just went
[47:38] totally away and I didn't that when I
[47:39] stepped out the next day no desire now
[47:42] see that's only God Satan won't ever do
[47:44] that that's God all right so you got to
[47:47] see that though in your own life that
[47:50] you made that step to sanctification and
[47:52] then you got to not stay there and say
[47:55] well I'm fine I feel good you know I
[47:57] could have come out of the water there
[47:58] in January and I said man I'm born again
[48:00] I just all of my cares have went away no
[48:02] I knew that God had to bring some kind
[48:05] of a quickening power to quicken you to
[48:09] the word not to anything else but to the
[48:11] Word of God so that you can start so
[48:13] that you listen so you can start
[48:14] understanding why serpent seeds the way
[48:17] it is you can understand why the Lord
[48:18] Jesus Christ is a baptism not that you
[48:20] can just read good brother Brian said
[48:22] it's just plain reading to be baptized
[48:25] in the name of Lord Jesus Christ it's
[48:26] just plain reading the sea serpent seed
[48:27] and all these different things but when
[48:30] you get a revelation revelation you
[48:31] can't I surf and seed from the garden
[48:33] all waiter today that I didn't do
[48:36] because it wasn't born again but now
[48:37] since I got the guy inside of me that
[48:39] wrote the book same with you there's no
[48:45] different than me and you I just had a
[48:49] little bit of a background
[48:51] I read cuz I love to read I read the
[48:53] message I just had all that laying there
[48:56] then God quickened it which thank God
[48:58] for that you ought to thank God for that
[49:01] for everything he's giving you you ought
[49:03] to thank God for it and then everything
[49:06] he gives you one revelation that's
[49:08] something he don't
[49:08] to everybody else he gives it to you
[49:12] alright so walk with God do the things
[49:15] of God I came to church I read in my
[49:17] Bible I started doing the things I was
[49:18] supposed to do
[49:19] hey man that's the key I didn't come up
[49:23] here and say all god save me and then
[49:26] you didn't see me for three months
[49:29] nobody know that's just like we talked
[49:33] about finding Jesus in jail that's just
[49:34] getting called hello that's what all
[49:42] people do they find Jesus in jail so the
[49:44] judge will say oh he's converted didn't
[49:46] they go out and kill somebody they find
[49:48] Jesus in jail no they just got caught
[49:51] come and confess your sins to God get
[49:54] rid of the thing and then do what he
[49:55] said walk in what he said start reading
[49:59] the Bible there's your key really don't
[50:03] worry about the message read the Bible
[50:06] it will direct you straight to the
[50:08] message I'll promise you because it
[50:11] should have done every one of us that
[50:12] last while we're sitting here today he
[50:14] directed us to a place you ought to
[50:17] thank God every day that he showed you
[50:18] this message where am I hallelujah
[50:24] that's I'm sorry he wasn't the only word
[50:27] he was God himself the dynamics in the
[50:30] word that made the body of Jesus Christ
[50:31] cold stiff and dead in the grave so it
[50:33] doesn't matter if somebody's body is
[50:35] close to him dead in the grave Jesus's
[50:39] was but when what was inside of him step
[50:43] back into that flesh i quickened him
[50:46] power shake into life and rise again and
[50:50] he didn't have to roll away the stone
[50:53] I believe all he done was just did this
[50:56] with his fingers he just did that and
[50:58] stone went over yeah it wasn't even an
[51:01] effort he could have walked through the
[51:03] stone he walked through the wall to
[51:06] business that disciples right after that
[51:08] didn't he so our stones not gonna hold
[51:10] him in the grave surely no Roman seal is
[51:12] gonna keep him there I am he that was
[51:14] dead so dead till the son said he was
[51:16] dead the moon said he was dead the star
[51:18] says dad sorry brother Hal Moore do
[51:19] Brist real fast all nature said he was
[51:21] dead
[51:22] she says I get too fast for him and now
[51:24] the whole world has to recognize that
[51:25] he's alive again why because you and I
[51:28] are here he was not only the mechanics
[51:32] God's Word he was the dynamics to prove
[51:34] it and as he being the groom the bride
[51:36] has to come forth cause it's part of him
[51:41] when he resurrected you were inside of
[51:45] him amen
[51:48] well I tell you we've already been to
[51:50] hell when he that Saturday that body may
[51:54] late cold stiff in the grave but his
[51:57] theophany was down into hell in another
[52:01] dimension telling them people who he was
[52:04] in the days of Noah those people he said
[52:06] I'm the one so brother Larry if you got
[52:11] the same theophany part inside of you
[52:12] you already been to hell you don't have
[52:15] to ever go again
[52:16] wherever he went that's where I was hey
[52:19] if brother Brown said oh we always go oh
[52:21] hallelujah we walk the shores of Galilee
[52:24] with him how live rather on him we went
[52:27] to hell with him - hey man good you
[52:31] don't have to go you already been
[52:36] because it's part of him and he can only
[52:39] be the manifestation of the fulfilling
[52:41] of all the revelations any others have
[52:46] spoke of the bride whoa it can only
[52:51] manifest now who's it going to manifest
[52:53] food the bride if it does something
[52:57] different from the groom it isn't the
[52:59] bride because she is flesh of his flesh
[53:03] bone of his bone life of his life power
[53:08] of his power hang on to that Germans
[53:11] have the cake hang on to that because
[53:15] we're going to talk about that in just a
[53:16] minute that says power of his power
[53:19] she is him as man and woman who want a
[53:22] woman taken from his side she had taken
[53:24] a spirit the feminist part from him the
[53:26] flesh from his side made both mechanics
[53:28] and dynamics the wife the spirit of him
[53:32] and the flesh of him and put it together
[53:34] and made mechanics and dynamic
[53:35] until the Church of the people until
[53:37] that church becomes both dynamics and
[53:40] mechanics in the spirit of God
[53:41] that moved him to do the things that he
[53:44] did if he had on 16 cylinders so will
[53:48] the bride a man for he said in John 14
[53:50] 12 he did believeth on me the works that
[53:52] I do shall he do also I'll give him a
[53:55] charge of my dynamics in his mechanics
[53:59] see I had the mechanics
[54:01] I had the mechanics I had read with my
[54:04] eyes in my brain had forged that in my
[54:09] brain Christ the mystery God revealed
[54:12] seven seals seven church age is Daniel
[54:14] seventy weeks I'd read them books when I
[54:15] was fourteen years old that was forged
[54:17] in my hand I didn't forget it why
[54:19] because I would need it but then when
[54:21] the dynamics come it charged that what I
[54:25] had held he didn't believe it on me the
[54:32] works that I do shall he do also I'll
[54:33] give him a charge of my dynamics in his
[54:35] mechanics that the world will not be
[54:37] able to withstand it and I'll ride raise
[54:41] him up again at the last day that's the
[54:43] Easter message the dynamics and
[54:46] mechanics together my mechanics without
[54:48] the dynamics no good neither is the
[54:50] dynamics without the mechanics you see
[54:52] people shout and jumping up and down
[54:54] they don't even know what the message
[54:55] says it just feels good well that's
[54:59] layout to see you it just feels good do
[55:01] it you can shout scream and shout jump
[55:04] up and down all you won't do and deny
[55:06] this word it won't do any good you're
[55:08] just cranking around the Pistons got
[55:10] this got the spark there to fire but no
[55:12] gasoline to fire it only works as they
[55:16] come together amen so one will sit still
[55:18] the other one will go up that's the only
[55:20] way there is to it you know what he's
[55:21] talking about there's one church gonna
[55:23] stay here and the bride's gonna leave so
[55:25] she gets both mechanics and dynamics but
[55:27] one has mechanics and dynamics it brings
[55:29] it the past of what he says the truth it
[55:32] just won't move no matter how good the
[55:33] mechanics is until the dynamics comes
[55:35] when the dynamics come that fires made
[55:37] to connect with that octane in the
[55:39] gasoline then that explodes it causes a
[55:41] combustion and that combustion moves
[55:43] every motion every move for here's the
[55:44] same yesterday today and forever
[55:47] alright let's move on
[55:51] to number four is the rising of the Sun
[55:53] same message that's that divine
[55:56] revelation of the word made flesh who is
[55:59] that you if it was flesh in that day by
[56:05] the Sun the groom it's the flesh today
[56:09] by the bride whoso sins you remit they
[56:12] were emitted whoso sins you've retained
[56:14] their retained I just told you that
[56:15] that's what judgment is now the Catholic
[56:17] Church picked it up and took it to the
[56:18] priest but that's carnal watch it was
[56:20] the spiritual revealed word that did it
[56:23] babies babies not babies it was a
[56:26] spiritually revealed word to mature
[56:29] people that will do it ma'am John 1:14
[56:33] says what and the word was made flesh
[56:36] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[56:39] glory the glory the only begotten of the
[56:41] Father full of grace and truth now
[56:43] listen I ask you a question about that
[56:44] it's why I put it up there again watch
[56:47] that scripture and we beheld his glory
[56:48] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[56:51] Father now let me ask you a question we
[56:53] know Jesus was begotten of the father
[56:55] right right now I want to ask you a
[57:02] question are you begotten of Jesus are
[57:06] you begotten to the Father if you've
[57:08] begun to Jesus your grandchild God don't
[57:11] have grandchildren so your begotten of
[57:14] the Father so that whole scriptures view
[57:16] you say full of grace and truth you
[57:18] better have some and the Word was made
[57:20] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[57:22] his glory the glory we know that was
[57:23] Jesus Christ
[57:24] but I wasn't begotten him Jesus Christ
[57:26] who was begotten of the father that
[57:28] makes me a grandchild now I was begotten
[57:30] to the Father who was that Jesus Christ
[57:34] we know Laurie
[57:35] amen look at number five seeds not air
[57:41] with a shuck then Along Came
[57:43] sanctification how many believes in
[57:45] scientific a sure we did you believe the
[57:47] Bible you have to that's what I mean you
[57:50] there is that's what people most people
[57:54] in the message they just believe the
[57:56] message and think they're born again
[58:00] know
[58:02] no no you must be justified Christ is
[58:09] the only person that can justly forgive
[58:12] you of your sins no one else God's the
[58:16] only one that can clean you up and put
[58:18] you aside for service just a Bible we
[58:23] got to go back and see the Bible and
[58:25] then when we see the Bible Way of
[58:27] justification sanctification I love the
[58:29] future home brother branham gets all the
[58:31] way up to telling us about the apex of
[58:34] the message the future home where we're
[58:36] going to live for an eternity our city
[58:40] he says don't forget to plan a
[58:42] Redemption
[58:43] he said don't forget justification
[58:45] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost he
[58:47] said that's what I've taught from the
[58:49] beginning and he said I see that it's
[58:50] still true today he didn't change his
[58:53] 1963 people say no 1963 so I just got to
[58:56] believe the message how the devil
[58:58] believes the message the devil believes
[59:01] in one garden trembles that's what the
[59:02] scriptures say no we got to get the
[59:05] essence of this message because look
[59:10] when we come to when you come to
[59:12] Pentecost you got the restoration the
[59:13] gifts brother Brian want him on the
[59:15] scene when the Holy Ghost fell in 1906
[59:17] weren't even born yet when he will not
[59:20] went on Einhorn is born so 1906 Azusa
[59:23] Street brother Brian one name of all
[59:24] wasn't even born when the Holy Ghost
[59:25] fell on that day of Pentecost right they
[59:30] call it the initial evidence of Holy
[59:31] Ghost speaking in tongues now remember
[59:33] the Holy Ghost came himself in the
[59:34] fullness of the baptism during that time
[59:37] to be the messenger but remember what
[59:40] didn't man do man stopped it man is the
[59:42] one that stopped and says speaking in
[59:44] tongues is it you don't speak in tongues
[59:46] you ain't got the Holy Ghost you know
[59:47] what God did God just moved right on
[59:50] just like the stock had life in or the
[59:53] two shoots had life in it the stock had
[59:56] life in it at one time the shuck had
[59:59] life in it at one time that's the
[1:00:00] Pentecost and held the grain but now
[1:00:03] remember what we're going to read right
[1:00:05] here that shuck has got to pull away to
[1:00:08] show the grain because the shook is not
[1:00:10] the great Chuck had life in it but the
[1:00:14] shuck is not the grain
[1:00:15] it protected the grain like I've said
[1:00:18] many times before brother Branham could
[1:00:20] not have come on the scene and been as
[1:00:23] effective as he was if it hadn't been
[1:00:25] for Pentecost think about it they had
[1:00:28] been for Pentecost and he went to the
[1:00:31] Pentecostal people because they accepted
[1:00:33] him the Baptist sure didn't the
[1:00:35] Methodists sure didn't they after a
[1:00:36] while they said no we don't want nothing
[1:00:38] to do with that but the Pentecostals
[1:00:39] because he had a little bit of that gift
[1:00:41] working and all that but remember that
[1:00:43] was the bait on the hook
[1:00:45] the hook was to get a body changed the
[1:00:48] hook was to bring the revelation to the
[1:00:50] seven seals thank God the sun's out our
[1:00:53] storms over thank God that was a lot of
[1:00:57] rain a minute ago but look speaking in
[1:00:59] tongues they call it the initial
[1:01:00] evidence speaking in tongues there they
[1:01:02] call the initial evidence which brought
[1:01:03] forth what the shock but they
[1:01:06] denominated but when you come to say I
[1:01:08] and my father are one and these other
[1:01:13] things then the shuk pulls away from it
[1:01:18] what is the shirt the shirt looks like
[1:01:21] the grain because it's kind of shaped
[1:01:22] like it why is it shaped like the grain
[1:01:24] because the grains got a shape inside I
[1:01:27] mean if the grains dislike if the grains
[1:01:29] like this
[1:01:30] the shirts gonna be like that because it
[1:01:32] covers it but remember a week is less
[1:01:35] almost like a football
[1:01:36] so the shuck has to do this over the top
[1:01:38] of it but see you shake that shuck off
[1:01:40] to get to the seed because there's where
[1:01:42] the life is and that's me and you the
[1:01:45] shuck pulls away why they can't stand to
[1:01:48] go on into the seed they can't go into
[1:01:51] the seed because they're not seed now
[1:01:53] you say well they're not born again know
[1:01:55] that I didn't say that
[1:01:56] they weren't seed for this time because
[1:01:58] when God moved on he brought seed for
[1:02:01] the end time because remember I will
[1:02:03] restore what restore back to seed that
[1:02:06] went in the ground but the real genuine
[1:02:10] bride Church will bring forth the entire
[1:02:13] Word of God in its fullness and in its
[1:02:18] strength for he is the same yesterday
[1:02:19] today and forever all right there bow
[1:02:23] out with that same man now let's go to
[1:02:27] John 14 real quick and I will
[1:02:29] the father and he shall give you another
[1:02:30] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:02:32] forever
[1:02:33] even the Spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:02:36] cannot receive I was thinking I want it
[1:02:38] I want you to do something for me just
[1:02:40] just something silly you sit down and do
[1:02:42] crossword puzzles
[1:02:43] I do word scape on my on my phone I'm
[1:02:46] confessing today I do little puzzles on
[1:02:50] my phone to kind of clear my brain every
[1:02:52] once in a while once in the morning
[1:02:54] while in the afternoon but just write
[1:02:57] down I was thinking about yesterday
[1:02:58] everybody's looking each other going I'm
[1:03:00] doing this minecraft so anyway we all
[1:03:05] have our little quirks but I lost my
[1:03:08] thought no take it
[1:03:09] I was thinking driving down the road
[1:03:10] yesterday you know I made mention the
[1:03:15] other day about what a cult is a cult or
[1:03:18] even something that they could come
[1:03:21] against us as it's normal practice you
[1:03:25] know what whatever whatever is normal to
[1:03:27] the world I want you to sit down one day
[1:03:32] and I want you to just list everything
[1:03:34] that you used to do hide it know
[1:03:38] everybody see it but then right now what
[1:03:42] you do now and look at what the world
[1:03:46] could see this was what the world still
[1:03:48] does this is normal I was thinking you
[1:03:52] know earrings girls wear pants to church
[1:03:55] now all that's normal that's normal in
[1:03:59] the outside world
[1:04:00] tattoos are normal it's okay don't worry
[1:04:03] about it two threes and high love this
[1:04:05] on my own whatever anyway you know
[1:04:07] earrings that is all normal that's
[1:04:10] accepted practice in 99% of the
[1:04:12] nominations of the world
[1:04:15] they've even got coffee shops and
[1:04:17] churches they've even gotten now they
[1:04:18] got a place where you got cup holders
[1:04:20] where you can bring your coffee in and
[1:04:22] sit down and have church you know but
[1:04:25] that's normal that's becoming normal
[1:04:27] it's normal for them to go to a bar and
[1:04:30] have a beer doesn't matter if you like
[1:04:33] this old saying goes you know a Baptist
[1:04:35] will talk to you unless he's in a liquor
[1:04:37] store
[1:04:40] think of that but that's become normal
[1:04:43] to them though that's all no smoking
[1:04:46] cigarettes the Baptist's always hated
[1:04:48] people that drink that's why they tell
[1:04:49] it Joe the Bible just hated people to
[1:04:51] drink with that smoke so they justified
[1:04:54] that somehow so but you look over here
[1:04:56] and write a list of things that's normal
[1:04:58] and then write what you do we're the
[1:05:02] most abnormal people in the world we
[1:05:04] don't even think like this world are you
[1:05:06] shouldn't I mean your thought process is
[1:05:09] not even like the world thank God is not
[1:05:11] like the world
[1:05:12] thank God he watched me and clean me up
[1:05:16] cleans you up and we don't have to go by
[1:05:19] accepted practices I mean think about it
[1:05:23] go inside your home and look at things
[1:05:24] that other people would be normal you
[1:05:26] know the cigarette lighter and a cigar
[1:05:28] machine and you know you see these
[1:05:30] things when you deliver mail you deliver
[1:05:32] them to the Baptist preacher you know
[1:05:34] anyway so I but now remember but see
[1:05:39] that's normal he's not gonna get in
[1:05:41] trouble with you know will get in
[1:05:42] trouble for any of that you know glia
[1:05:44] trouble for going to church with your
[1:05:45] pants on sisters in a Baptist Church now
[1:05:48] even about shorts you see men going in
[1:05:51] with short
[1:05:52] now that's accepted practice to them to
[1:05:54] you and I Oh will be totally abnormal
[1:05:56] Amen why because we've been changed our
[1:06:00] whole attitude that's why this world is
[1:06:02] not our home but there's enough of this
[1:06:05] world I've known about this earth not
[1:06:07] the world there's enough of this earth
[1:06:08] that's gonna bring me right back to here
[1:06:09] cuz this is mine
[1:06:11] this was our earth before Satan became a
[1:06:14] squatter this is my er this is my earth
[1:06:18] and God come in and mating his earth
[1:06:21] even the Spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:06:23] cannot receive but just do that
[1:06:25] something I'm just kind of run through
[1:06:26] your mind all the things that you see
[1:06:28] people do that's accepted practice and
[1:06:30] then you try to think of them you're
[1:06:32] just weird
[1:06:33] we're just weird we don't even claim
[1:06:36] like that we're like what in the world
[1:06:38] are they thinking but you know what it's
[1:06:40] just accepted practicing like me and
[1:06:42] that man was talking yesterday brother
[1:06:43] he's he's he and he's not a Baptist he
[1:06:45] don't know what he is he's definitely
[1:06:48] not a Baptist cuz he's talking started
[1:06:49] talking my marriage and divorcing and
[1:06:50] this is the denominational guys don't
[1:06:52] tell my marriage in divorce
[1:06:53] he said what do you think
[1:06:54] he said we got Deakins as mayor three or
[1:06:56] four times and all my stuff I said well
[1:06:58] you know what the Bible says he's here I
[1:06:59] don't know what the Bible says he said
[1:07:01] let your wife committed adultery unless
[1:07:03] your wife's dead you can't marry again
[1:07:07] woman can't ever marry again where we
[1:07:10] been but that's all normal they can do
[1:07:13] that out there but we don't do that
[1:07:20] well when you start talking about
[1:07:21] marriage and divorce people get quiet
[1:07:25] you can shout about everything in the
[1:07:27] world but when you start saying when you
[1:07:28] say them two words or three imagined
[1:07:31] divorced everybody goes you couldn't go
[1:07:36] in all day and not say nothing about
[1:07:37] that we've all had our problem but you
[1:07:43] know what there's that God's might away
[1:07:47] God's made away I promise you once you
[1:07:50] get born again you won't ever do it
[1:07:51] again remember brother Bram said go on
[1:07:53] his y'all don't ever do it again
[1:07:55] all right so so so be thankful for grace
[1:08:00] but let's don't make it greasy graves
[1:08:01] because see they've made a greasy grace
[1:08:03] out there cuz the first thing they tell
[1:08:05] you I'm telling you talk to somebody and
[1:08:07] talk about how perfect you are and how
[1:08:08] God's made you perfect first thing they
[1:08:09] gonna say is not ain't perfect you ain't
[1:08:11] perfect I saw you talking about yourself
[1:08:14] I'm talking about me I won't say you
[1:08:15] what God said about me after you tell
[1:08:17] you what you said about you I said but
[1:08:18] God said I was perfect I don't know
[1:08:21] about that you see what I mean that's
[1:08:24] accepted practice to just make an excuse
[1:08:26] that you're not perfect it's why I do
[1:08:28] these things I don't know the angle
[1:08:32] charge you for that go that well I guess
[1:08:35] it did have something to do with a sixth
[1:08:37] seal anyway even the Spirit of Truth
[1:08:40] whom the world cannot receive because it
[1:08:42] seeth him not the world has blinded
[1:08:45] itself to God because remember they
[1:08:48] think they're still going to heaven I'm
[1:08:50] not talking listen when I tell you to
[1:08:52] right now I'm not telling you right down
[1:08:53] what a what a drunkard do I'm talking
[1:08:56] about nominal Christians just write down
[1:08:59] what they do and then write down what
[1:09:01] you do because they think they're born
[1:09:04] again doing these things that's accepted
[1:09:07] practice
[1:09:07] now why because of this thing right here
[1:09:10] weak pulpit and then.we pulpit because
[1:09:15] it seeth him not neither knoweth him but
[1:09:21] you know him for his dwelling with you
[1:09:24] and shall be in you I will not leave you
[1:09:27] comfortless I will come to you yet a
[1:09:30] little while in the world seeth or
[1:09:33] understandeth me no more they've lost
[1:09:36] the understanding of Christianity but ye
[1:09:40] see me because we have it because I live
[1:09:43] now see that's what brother Branham it
[1:09:45] took a prophet to turn us back to that
[1:09:48] right way of living but remember that
[1:09:52] wasn't his message it was part of it it
[1:09:54] was to restore and then bring the seals
[1:09:56] and then bring the revelation statue a
[1:09:58] perfect man and all those all those
[1:10:00] things to show Christ in you the hope of
[1:10:02] glory at that day you shall know that I
[1:10:05] am in my father and ye and me and I in
[1:10:09] you looks like there's one person
[1:10:10] standing there he's not three look I and
[1:10:15] my father in da9 you but if I'm in my
[1:10:23] father he's in the same place if ye and
[1:10:27] me we're in the same place you're not
[1:10:29] moving three people around you got one
[1:10:32] person all right I'm trying to cut this
[1:10:42] thing short here let's go the next one
[1:10:49] here you him talk about oh let's read
[1:10:55] this one the supernatural something
[1:10:56] taking place his garment glistened like
[1:10:58] the Sun in the middle of the day as wide
[1:11:00] as they could be God placed on him that
[1:11:02] robe of immortality showing that he had
[1:11:04] received him now remember this was
[1:11:06] Matthew 17 mount transfiguration when
[1:11:09] the adoption came but now remember when
[1:11:14] he put that robe of immortality on on
[1:11:16] Christ remember it was temporary
[1:11:21] six months later he died you can't die
[1:11:24] any mortal person it was showing a
[1:11:27] position that he had come to alright
[1:11:29] that's the thing that God will do to his
[1:11:31] sons here on the earth someday he will
[1:11:33] call you a side Church if you'll only
[1:11:35] obey Him who obey Christ obey Christ and
[1:11:41] stay on the word and believe it and he
[1:11:44] will place into the church before the
[1:11:46] coming of Jesus Christ he will place
[1:11:48] into the church all the powers that
[1:11:51] Christ had in him will be in the church
[1:11:55] all that God was he poured into Jesus
[1:11:58] all that Jesus was he pours into the
[1:12:00] church God wanting his work done he sent
[1:12:04] it into his son the son wanting the work
[1:12:08] done sent it into the church at that day
[1:12:13] because the same power of God was in
[1:12:15] Jehovah God rested in Jesus Christ the
[1:12:18] same power that rested in Jesus Christ
[1:12:20] rest into place sons in the body of
[1:12:23] Christ amen
[1:12:24] placing up a son take him out a certain
[1:12:27] place have a ceremony before angels
[1:12:28] place them positionally that's what the
[1:12:31] statute of perfectman does it places you
[1:12:33] positionally what he is in the body of
[1:12:37] Christ then that person has the
[1:12:42] authority let me say this if you count
[1:12:45] me a fanatic from this not on that very
[1:12:48] same thing that I'm speaking of will be
[1:12:51] done now brother branham is prophesying
[1:12:55] he's opening something up that will be
[1:12:59] done
[1:12:59] he said if you count me up for now this
[1:13:01] what I'm telling you will be done
[1:13:03] what there'll be a power put into the
[1:13:05] church and now is coming in that the
[1:13:08] Holy Spirit will so anoint the people
[1:13:10] till they'll speak the word and it will
[1:13:13] create itself right there we haven't
[1:13:15] seen powers left like that coming into
[1:13:18] the church now now listen this is 1960
[1:13:24] brother Adams went through almost what
[1:13:27] 23 years of seeing healing after healing
[1:13:33] after
[1:13:34] feeling after anointing after dead being
[1:13:36] raised sick being healed we haven't seen
[1:13:41] powers that likes coming into the church
[1:13:44] now I know it for a fact saying to this
[1:13:50] mountain be moved don't doubt in your
[1:13:52] heart but believe that what you've said
[1:13:55] shall come to pass you can have what you
[1:13:58] have said the placing of the church in
[1:14:01] position where the fullness of the power
[1:14:03] of the Holy Ghost comes into the church
[1:14:05] then critics mouths will be shut oh
[1:14:08] don't you think there's critics hey man
[1:14:14] there's critics amen the critics mouth
[1:14:18] will be shut it will be a short time
[1:14:22] Jesus came right off the mountain and
[1:14:25] went straight to Calvary that's what a
[1:14:26] man he he had that robe of immortality
[1:14:28] on him but six months later he went to
[1:14:29] Calvary right here notice it won't last
[1:14:32] long but it'll be there there's your
[1:14:36] prophet telling us what we're going on
[1:14:38] all right and let's read the next one
[1:14:40] maybe just a touch longer today but
[1:14:44] it'll be okay we'll be fine we'll go
[1:14:46] outside for two hours and stand talking
[1:14:48] anyway why did he say in Malachi 4 would
[1:14:51] restore restore by the original
[1:14:53] Pentecostal faith now that's what the
[1:14:55] first part of his message was to I mean
[1:14:58] you've been looking at my honey and
[1:15:00] hombre sorry back to the pitch should
[1:15:02] have slapped me all the way back to the
[1:15:04] people with the same Pentecostal message
[1:15:06] the same Pentecostal sign the same
[1:15:09] Pentecostal evidence the same God the
[1:15:11] same power the same teaching everything
[1:15:15] exactly with the vindication of the same
[1:15:18] pillar of fire that struck Paul down on
[1:15:20] the road down to Damascus amongst us
[1:15:22] today doing the same things he did in
[1:15:25] that day uniting we see the nations
[1:15:27] uniting we see the world uniting we see
[1:15:30] the church is uniting we see the bride
[1:15:32] uniting uniting with the word 1 the word
[1:15:35] is God and as the word as the bridegroom
[1:15:39] being the word and the bride being the
[1:15:42] hearer of the word they come together in
[1:15:45] a union that unites
[1:15:48] wedding see they're getting ready for a
[1:15:50] wedding and they become one the word
[1:15:55] becomes you you become the word how much
[1:15:58] plainer can that be we've read these
[1:16:01] quotes ins 1963 but you know what they
[1:16:04] mean a lot more to me now than they did
[1:16:05] six months ago two years ago or whenever
[1:16:07] I read it last time an they you not like
[1:16:11] a wedding they're getting ready for a
[1:16:12] wedding they become one the word becomes
[1:16:14] you you become the word jesus said that
[1:16:16] that day you know what all the father is
[1:16:19] I am all I am you are and all you are I
[1:16:23] am
[1:16:25] Wow in that day you know that I mean the
[1:16:29] father father me iron you and you and me
[1:16:30] see that day what day this day we find
[1:16:34] out the great hidden mystery of God
[1:16:36] being revealed and what I tell you the
[1:16:38] great mystery of God is Christ in you
[1:16:39] the hope of glory that God can walk
[1:16:41] around on this earth and be so abnormal
[1:16:44] but walk around here on the face of the
[1:16:45] earth and be God walking on two feet
[1:16:48] amen oh how I like that he said all
[1:16:52] right let's go to that now this is the
[1:16:53] second part I want I want us to get to
[1:16:55] this and then we'll close gone 11:25
[1:17:00] jesus said unto her I am the
[1:17:01] resurrection and the life he that
[1:17:04] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[1:17:06] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[1:17:09] believeth in me shall never die believe
[1:17:13] us now this so let's hear what brother
[1:17:15] Graham said this go tell my disciples 19
[1:17:17] this is 1953 he went to the grave of
[1:17:21] lives was crying like a man tears
[1:17:23] rolling down his cheek as you wept and
[1:17:25] stood there and a man that had been dead
[1:17:27] for days and the skin worms crawling in
[1:17:29] and out of his body but see him raised
[1:17:31] his little figure locked out and say I
[1:17:34] am the resurrection and the life he that
[1:17:36] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[1:17:38] shall he live whosoever liveth and
[1:17:40] believeth in me shall never die think of
[1:17:42] it he that believeth liveth and
[1:17:43] believeth in me shall never die what
[1:17:46] hope we have this morning then when we
[1:17:47] visit our grave our loved ones what I
[1:17:49] hope we have in this mortal flesh today
[1:17:53] as the Holy Spirit bears record he lives
[1:17:57] what in your mortal flesh shall never
[1:18:01] die has ever
[1:18:02] lasting life yet we packed the body over
[1:18:03] the graves of the saintly of us but
[1:18:06] inside they are alive they're living
[1:18:09] somewhere now remember he'd know you'd
[1:18:10] been behind the curtain of time at that
[1:18:11] at that point it's 1953 when he stood
[1:18:14] and said I am the resurrection and the
[1:18:17] life and there was a man laying there he
[1:18:19] said take away the stone and the
[1:18:21] contamination of his body that odor of a
[1:18:23] human body you know what it is when they
[1:18:25] raised up why it was a sickly smell
[1:18:27] around here but you know what he did
[1:18:30] that bother him it bothered Martha it
[1:18:33] didn't bother him but he spoke out and
[1:18:36] said Lazarus come forth and a man that
[1:18:39] had been dead for days rose up from the
[1:18:41] grave now where is a resurrection voice
[1:18:44] message at it's in me and you all right
[1:18:47] so one of the reason I read that forget
[1:18:49] about the circumstances well it looks
[1:18:52] pretty bad it stinks there's a sickly
[1:18:56] smell around here what death and
[1:18:58] embalming Jesus
[1:18:59] he'd already told him he was all right
[1:19:02] let's go to the next one number nine or
[1:19:03] the next one then Jesus came a-calling
[1:19:07] 1964 neither has he changed yet just as
[1:19:10] much God tonight as he ever was she
[1:19:12] asked my brother branham he was trying
[1:19:14] to get the people to see he was God
[1:19:15] right there he wasn't a historical God
[1:19:18] he changes not and he knew she knew that
[1:19:21] it was him was just a few minutes it
[1:19:23] proved it when she said something to him
[1:19:26] about her brother said Lord I believe
[1:19:27] that you are and he said watch I am the
[1:19:30] resurrection and the life though he were
[1:19:32] dead yet shall he live and whosoever
[1:19:34] liveth and believeth me shall never die
[1:19:35] I am that's the I am was in the burning
[1:19:41] bush with Moses I am the resurrection I
[1:19:45] am the life I was the wall I am still he
[1:19:50] I am the resurrection and the life he
[1:19:52] that believeth in me though he were dead
[1:19:54] yet shall he live whosoever liveth and
[1:19:57] believeth in me shall never die after
[1:19:59] this great assurance that she had that
[1:20:02] he was the promised word when he said
[1:20:04] being a prophet he could not lie
[1:20:06] therefore he when he said I am the red
[1:20:09] he said I am the I am now that's not in
[1:20:13] the scripture
[1:20:15] but it's hooking the scriptures together
[1:20:17] he knew it was the same person who spoke
[1:20:18] to Moses in the burning bush it's the
[1:20:21] same person who gave you the new bars
[1:20:23] that's why it's the I am I am he that is
[1:20:28] the resurrection and the life are we
[1:20:31] thinking about Jesus so we're thinking
[1:20:33] about the Jesus inside of us are let's
[1:20:34] go to the next one
[1:20:35] number 10 or whatever the next one is
[1:20:40] excuse me then Jesus came and called
[1:20:42] 1964 now when she heard she was right he
[1:20:45] said I am the resurrection and the life
[1:20:47] I am old watering assurance that the
[1:20:49] promise word for he was that I am that
[1:20:52] was in the wilderness with Moses back
[1:20:54] there in the burning bush even when all
[1:20:56] hope was gone yet she was satisfied if
[1:20:58] she could only get him to ask it would
[1:20:59] take place now how we need faith like
[1:21:02] that today now she had to believe for
[1:21:05] the impossible here's the whole thing
[1:21:07] this is the whole key we've got to
[1:21:09] believe something that's totally
[1:21:10] impossible we've got to believe for
[1:21:15] something that's totally but what's the
[1:21:16] believing it's believing unto that all
[1:21:21] things are possible to him that believes
[1:21:23] she had to believe for the Impossibles
[1:21:26] to the modern mind listen to the modern
[1:21:29] way of thinking we're not gonna get a
[1:21:31] body change we're just going to die and
[1:21:34] come up in a resurrection with something
[1:21:36] brand-new that's what the denominations
[1:21:39] and most of people in this message if
[1:21:40] you nail them down they don't think
[1:21:42] there's enough to get this thing around
[1:21:43] here changed but if it changed Jesus's
[1:21:46] body is gonna change mine
[1:21:48] hey man didn't bother him one bit now
[1:21:51] she had to believe for the Impossibles
[1:21:53] yet the modern mind modern way of
[1:21:55] thinking she had to believe for the
[1:21:58] impossible but impossible things are
[1:22:01] made real when God has took at his word
[1:22:03] the Impossibles has made realities when
[1:22:07] God is taken at his word amen alright
[1:22:12] let's go to number 11 junction of time I
[1:22:13] like this one now here's what we're
[1:22:15] going to bring this word in but I want
[1:22:16] you to see what this word means in just
[1:22:17] a minute there you walk to the grave
[1:22:20] omnipotence manifesting here among us
[1:22:23] living with us God in Christ reconciling
[1:22:27] the world
[1:22:29] to himself here he lived with us God
[1:22:32] proving himself through his son Christ
[1:22:35] Jesus
[1:22:35] he was omnipotent and miraculous and if
[1:22:40] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:22:41] forever
[1:22:42] where is that omnipotent and miraculous
[1:22:44] person at may I interpolate where's yet
[1:22:49] he's in you he said I will never leave
[1:22:52] you I'll never forsake you I'll be with
[1:22:55] you to the end of the world how can we
[1:22:58] look for anything else but when he
[1:23:01] speaks for them for when he speaks for
[1:23:04] the miraculous to happen how can we
[1:23:07] expect anything else so here he goes
[1:23:09] down to the grave of weeping and then
[1:23:11] omnipotence gathered itself together hey
[1:23:15] a prophet could only say that and then
[1:23:17] I'll nipa thence gathered itself
[1:23:19] together and he spoke Lazarus come forth
[1:23:22] and the man who was already rotting his
[1:23:25] nose that fell in his face for four days
[1:23:26] the skin worms had done set in
[1:23:28] corruption knew its master hallelujah
[1:23:30] think about what happened inside that
[1:23:32] tomb what kind of reaction took place
[1:23:35] inside that tomb for that body then skin
[1:23:38] worms to go away and for his nose to
[1:23:40] come back and for everything to come
[1:23:42] back and shake that body back to life
[1:23:44] old man if he can do it we can do
[1:23:48] through him we can do this he gave back
[1:23:52] to life of this dead man and a man that
[1:23:54] was once dead stood on his feet and
[1:23:56] lived again the miraculous I am the
[1:24:00] resurrection and the life saith God he
[1:24:03] did believe it in me though he were dead
[1:24:04] yet shall he live and whosoever liveth
[1:24:07] and believeth in me shall never die
[1:24:08] speak omnipotence miraculous will take
[1:24:13] place
[1:24:14] now it's God here to speak in the tomb
[1:24:16] of left frontal tomb of Lazarus
[1:24:18] it's God here today in human flesh and
[1:24:22] yours speak omnipotence miraculous will
[1:24:29] take place and you always do it at the
[1:24:33] junction we're at a junction right now
[1:24:35] folks they might have been in the
[1:24:37] junction in 1956 but we're at a junction
[1:24:40] of time right here because we're tight
[1:24:41] we're fixing
[1:24:42] blend right into eternity and we're at
[1:24:45] the junction be alarmed when you see
[1:24:48] these things happening we're at the end
[1:24:50] time omnipotent speaks and a dead man
[1:24:54] dead and lived again stood on his feet
[1:24:57] and went to a banquet and eat supper
[1:24:58] with him oh my what happened some
[1:25:00] glorious day while we were once dead in
[1:25:03] sin and trespasses omnipotent spoke we
[1:25:07] were going to hell and omnipotent spoke
[1:25:09] we've raised from hell to glory and
[1:25:12] someday we'll eat the banquet supper at
[1:25:15] the last day omnipotent speaks God's
[1:25:18] word is omnipotent we believe it and
[1:25:21] raised from death into life
[1:25:22] he's a here with my words and believe in
[1:25:24] me though he were dead yet shall he live
[1:25:26] whoso liveth and believeth in me shall
[1:25:28] never die
[1:25:28] I'm nipa tense you know what I'm nipa
[1:25:32] tense means pull it up pull up to the
[1:25:38] next one where it says entomology you
[1:25:42] didn't get that one you got that was not
[1:25:46] on the you didn't get the definition
[1:25:54] maybe not anyway I'll rep leave it right
[1:25:57] there
[1:25:58] the word omnipotence derives from the
[1:26:01] latin term of me omnipotence meaning all
[1:26:09] how many means all protein means
[1:26:12] powerful the meaning of the term
[1:26:15] omnipotent has been used to connect a
[1:26:18] number of different positions these
[1:26:21] positions include but aren't limited to
[1:26:22] the following a deity is able to do
[1:26:26] anything that it chooses to do now
[1:26:32] that's easy for us to say about God wake
[1:26:36] up for a minute that's the easy to say
[1:26:40] about God a deity is able to do anything
[1:26:45] that he chooses chooses to do he's
[1:26:47] omnipotent and then everybody believe
[1:26:49] that's a man
[1:26:50] oh let's read this next quote verse
[1:26:53] number 12 when
[1:26:56] he said the expression he made I jotted
[1:26:58] it down no go back to go back to the one
[1:27:01] before that when he said no you're up
[1:27:04] when he said the expression he made I
[1:27:06] jotted it down on a piece of paper I'll
[1:27:09] pick it up in my office there to
[1:27:11] omnipotence met now are they two guards
[1:27:18] Satan's not all-powerful hello to
[1:27:26] omnipotence met that's true when God and
[1:27:30] a believer meet there's two omnipotence
[1:27:38] because God a man is a part of God he's
[1:27:45] the son of God and what little he is
[1:27:49] joins the entire body jesus said in mark
[1:27:53] 11:22 if you say to this mountain be
[1:27:55] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:27:56] believe what you have said you can it
[1:27:59] will come to pass believe that what you
[1:28:02] said and a Christian is so marked that
[1:28:05] around him is an atmosphere a Christian
[1:28:10] is so so I saying about normal abnormal
[1:28:12] we're so marked abnormal but were the
[1:28:15] most normal people in the world alright
[1:28:17] let's go to the bear lap this is the
[1:28:18] last one and we'll be finished mm-hmm go
[1:28:21] to last quote Pat miss vision to watch
[1:28:23] this a man cut every obstacle from human
[1:28:26] beings that they might be connected like
[1:28:29] in the Garden of Eden I was going to
[1:28:32] choke it but I'm gonna say it man is
[1:28:36] omnipotent you don't believe that but he
[1:28:43] is a man fully surrendered to God is
[1:28:46] omnipotent now what does I'm member that
[1:28:49] mean all-powerful did not he say mark 11
[1:28:55] whatsoever things you say and don't down
[1:28:57] in your heart it will come to pass you
[1:28:59] can have what you've said what happens
[1:29:02] when to omnipotence meet when God and
[1:29:06] man comes together through I'm nip
[1:29:08] tense something's got to shake some
[1:29:12] whatsoever you'd say with that creative
[1:29:15] power of an impetus of God knowing that
[1:29:19] he's promised it and he said it in his
[1:29:22] word it creates a power that goes out
[1:29:26] you under and brings things to pass
[1:29:28] things that is not it makes them as
[1:29:32] though they are because to omnipotence
[1:29:34] have met there he stands oh isn't he
[1:29:40] wonderful to omnipotent to all-powerful
[1:29:45] meet amen
[1:29:54] omnipotent means all-powerful I'm just
[1:29:59] reading you what brother MC about less
[1:30:03] because the to omnipotence is you and
[1:30:06] God when two of nimpah tents meet and we
[1:30:11] believe the word of God knowing that he
[1:30:13] promised it and he said it in this word
[1:30:15] it creates a power that I'm gonna
[1:30:17] interpolate here a power that will
[1:30:19] change your body cuz remember it's
[1:30:21] already change your thought process it
[1:30:23] should already have thought we shouldn't
[1:30:27] be thinking like we were thinking before
[1:30:30] why are we still in this message 50
[1:30:32] something years we ain't nothing going
[1:30:34] on yeah they something going on maybe
[1:30:36] you need to get on the train maybe you
[1:30:39] need to get the reading quotes like that
[1:30:41] that is what it'll give you a confidence
[1:30:43] inside of you that God's already said
[1:30:46] that about us in 1964 that to
[1:30:49] omnipotence have met and that doesn't
[1:30:55] include the devil know where he's
[1:30:58] totally out of the picture let's stand
[1:30:59] her feet he's totally out of the picture
[1:31:02] it's not to omnipotence God in the devil
[1:31:05] heavily days so where does the power lay
[1:31:11] the power lays inside of you
[1:31:18] get going to clap he's the one who did
[1:31:21] it for you I didn't
[1:31:22] musicians let's come when to omnipotence
[1:31:27] meet see listen when you get to have the
[1:31:30] mind of Christ what else is that you've
[1:31:33] lost the mind of your human nature of
[1:31:35] your human even your thoughts look the
[1:31:38] things that we preach the things that we
[1:31:40] see and the things that we hear when we
[1:31:43] mash play the world don't understand
[1:31:47] that but you're right there in tune with
[1:31:50] it when you say man you're saying so be
[1:31:53] it that that's exactly correct
[1:31:56] cuz what what I'm impotent it's looking
[1:32:00] at the other one saying that ain't
[1:32:01] nothing but the truth

[1:34:29] delight shall ever old he's a little
[1:34:37] morning song is the Farish
[1:34:40] ten thousand to my soul you know I was
[1:34:44] over in the Philippines
[1:34:46] I'm Philippines in Jamaica a couple
[1:34:48] years ago we had that youth camp and
[1:34:51] this song came on my heart what we were
[1:34:54] singing that song I felt led I didn't
[1:34:59] know how we were gonna we weren't gonna
[1:35:01] have a prayer line we were just gonna
[1:35:03] you know pray for everybody
[1:35:04] it was a youth camp and that song did
[1:35:08] just diverse there stuck out a wall of
[1:35:10] fire around me I have nothing nada fair
[1:35:14] so I had all the Deacons and all the
[1:35:17] brothers in circle all the youth in the
[1:35:23] whole building several hundred kids and
[1:35:25] they encircled them and held hands I
[1:35:28] said okay kids there's a wall of fire
[1:35:31] [Music]
[1:35:34] nothing to fear there's a wall around
[1:35:37] you and brother we started praying and I
[1:35:39] have not prayed for 30 minutes in my
[1:35:41] life I'm sorry I just haven't we prayed
[1:35:43] for over 30 minutes and God did some
[1:35:46] work inside that ring a fire because
[1:35:48] they really caught on that they were in
[1:35:50] a safe place because they had that wall
[1:35:53] the fire all around them and I said
[1:35:55] there's nothing out of fear this is what
[1:35:57] tells you now the wall that fire is
[1:35:59] gonna keep everything whatever you need
[1:36:00] to get rid of you just throw it to that
[1:36:03] wall of fire and let it burn it up and
[1:36:05] buddy we have a good time but that you
[1:36:07] look and you see the inspiration of this
[1:36:09] person whoever wrote this so I'm like a
[1:36:11] lily of the valley and then all of a
[1:36:12] sudden he says there's a wall of fire
[1:36:14] around me there's nothing now to fear he
[1:36:17] might be the piece of the lily of the
[1:36:19] valley but there's got to be a fire that
[1:36:22] wall the fire is all the way around us
[1:36:24] listen my brother Dale said I don't
[1:36:26] think you're just I don't think you'll
[1:36:28] walk through the city of the future home
[1:36:30] and you're listed like this light bulb
[1:36:32] but there is a glow over the whole city
[1:36:35] because of you being there because of
[1:36:38] you being there and because of you
[1:36:40] walking in this world jesus said I'm the
[1:36:42] light of the world
[1:36:43] well if Jesus said I'm the light of the
[1:36:45] world so are you
[1:36:46] you're listen you're walking through a
[1:36:48] dark place right now sure we got
[1:36:51] artificial light but when you walk out
[1:36:53] in that world
[1:36:54] that's demon territory and you better
[1:36:59] hope you got a wall of fire around you
[1:37:02] maybe that you can't see
[1:37:04] I pray one day they gonna show it to us
[1:37:08] he'll just show you a little something
[1:37:11] because you know Satan to love to kill
[1:37:13] every one of us every breath we take God
[1:37:17] has protected that breath cuz Satan's
[1:37:20] standing there wanting to just
[1:37:22] absolutely cuz if he can get rid of you
[1:37:25] he's got God whipped because there's
[1:37:29] nothing in the plan of God that says God
[1:37:31] can come back here and redo the whole
[1:37:33] thing again he can't come back here down
[1:37:36] across again so God's got to put a wall
[1:37:39] of fire around you because he's
[1:37:41] protecting what he's already said he's
[1:37:44] protecting this word and that word walks
[1:37:46] in you through life you're the word made
[1:37:52] flesh to omnipotence have met
[1:37:58] and we are in a place to where now them
[1:38:01] to omnipotence work together he's never
[1:38:04] had a group of people that he can work
[1:38:05] through like he has right now I don't
[1:38:07] believe that he sure he's used them in
[1:38:09] the power that they needed in for each
[1:38:10] time and each church age but right now
[1:38:12] today we gotta believe the impossible
[1:38:15] and to believe the impossible we have
[1:38:20] become the impossible you and I are an
[1:38:24] impossibility we are we're impossible
[1:38:27] this should not happen it really think
[1:38:31] about it think about it like I said when
[1:38:34] you open the Bible you don't see a
[1:38:36] Trinity you don't see eating an apple
[1:38:40] you don't see what about tens imma name
[1:38:45] father son holder you don't see eternal
[1:38:47] hell you don't see those things in here
[1:38:48] now did the Bible change no the
[1:38:52] omnipotence it wrote it once you're
[1:38:57] connected to God you can't separate he
[1:39:01] can't do it brother Louie he cannot sit
[1:39:04] how can he separate himself he cannot
[1:39:08] separate himself once he's joined he's
[1:39:11] vulcanized I wish Ida took that picture
[1:39:13] in the Philippines we vulcanized here I
[1:39:15] think that brother Joe I think we need
[1:39:17] to put that over the back of the window
[1:39:18] of the door also we vulcanized here amen
[1:39:23] we vulcanized right here that was a sign
[1:39:25] in the Philippines that our place is we
[1:39:28] vulcanize here I don't man we need to
[1:39:30] stop and take a picture of that because
[1:39:31] you know I've organized and does it puts
[1:39:34] two pieces of the same material when to
[1:39:38] omnipotence meet they become one god
[1:39:42] bless you let's pray your heavenly
[1:39:43] Father Lord we've held the people a long
[1:39:46] time we're sorry for that father but we
[1:39:47] pray that what we said will be something
[1:39:50] that will help them through their
[1:39:52] journey

[1:39:55] things that we have to deal with Lord is
