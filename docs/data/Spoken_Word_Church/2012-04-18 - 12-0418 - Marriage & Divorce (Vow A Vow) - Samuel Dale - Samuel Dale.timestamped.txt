[4:20] said you sent your word and healed us
[4:22] and delivered us from destruction so we
[4:24] depend upon the promise that you made
[4:27] unto us guide us now as we read your
[4:30] word you come Among Us and speak to our
[4:32] hearts in Jesus name amen amen okay
[4:37] Matthew one scripture we read one uh
[4:42] last Wednesday
[4:44] and so we'll come back over that again
[4:47] so Matthew 1:18 now the birth of Jesus
[4:50] Christ was on this wise when as his
[4:52] mother Mary was spouse to Joseph before
[4:55] they came together she was found with
[4:58] child of the Holy Ghost
[5:00] then Joseph her husband remember what we
[5:03] used last week was talking about it it's
[5:05] always everybody's always talking about
[5:07] you not to take unto thee marry thy wife
[5:09] you know and all like that but see the
[5:11] Bible said then Joseph her husband being
[5:13] a just man and not willing to make her a
[5:16] public example was mindful to put her
[5:18] away
[5:19] privately but while he thought on these
[5:21] things behold the angel of the Lord
[5:22] appeared unto him in a dream saying
[5:24] Joseph thy son of David fear not to take
[5:26] unto thee Mary thy wife for that which
[5:28] is conceived in her of the Holy Ghost
[5:31] and she brought forth a son and thou
[5:34] shallal call his name Jesus or he shall
[5:37] save his people from their sins now all
[5:40] this was done that it might be fulfilled
[5:42] which was spoken of the Lord by the
[5:44] prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be
[5:47] with child and shall bring forth a son
[5:49] they shall call his name Emmanuel which
[5:51] by in being interpreted is god with us
[5:55] then Joseph being raised from sleep did
[5:57] as the angel of the Lord had bidden him
[5:59] and took unto him his wife and he knew
[6:02] her not till she had brought forth her
[6:04] firstborn son and he called his name
[6:09] Jesus now if you'll notice in those
[6:12] scriptures there that that Jesus
[6:15] is kind of italicized us a little bit
[6:20] right cuz that's a very great thing you
[6:22] said well that doesn't mean very much
[6:23] well just look in your Bible while
[6:24] you're if you're looking at it look down
[6:27] right down below and look at the second
[6:29] chapter and you'll see it uses the word
[6:31] Jesus with a small
[6:33] letter it does mean something for those
[6:37] things okay Deuteronomy 23 verse
[6:41] 21 and thou when thou shalt vow a vow
[6:44] unto the Lord thy God Thou shalt not
[6:47] slack to pay it for the Lord thy God
[6:51] will surely require it of thee and it
[6:53] would be sin in thee now follow that
[6:56] line brother R said if we watched that
[6:58] he said we wouldn't have the marriage
[7:00] and divorce problem I was reading that
[7:02] just the other day he said we wouldn't
[7:03] have them if we watched that part what
[7:06] if you make a vow and don't keep the vow
[7:09] what has it
[7:10] become sin right and look how he he
[7:13] emphatically States it in verse 22 but
[7:16] if Thou
[7:17] shalt but if Thou shalt
[7:20] forbear to vow it shall be no sin in the
[7:23] now forar means to not vow so he's
[7:27] saying if you vow don't keep you vow
[7:30] it's a sin but if you forebear to
[7:33] vow you haven't sinned so just don't vow
[7:36] that's what the prophet
[7:38] said all right that which is gone out of
[7:41] thy lips Thou shalt keep and perform
[7:43] even a feveral offering according as
[7:46] thou H has vowed unto the Lord thy God
[7:49] which thou Hast promised with thy mouth
[7:52] you may be seated the Lord that is
[7:54] blessing to the reading of the word
[7:56] remember in
[7:58] Matthew
[8:00] there we gave the other day that it says
[8:03] you know by your words you be
[8:05] justified by your words you be condemned
[8:08] right all right so then we're doing it
[8:11] now tonight I'm going to do it a little
[8:12] different because I want you to keep
[8:14] these and we're going to give you the
[8:17] the quotes and but yet we're still going
[8:19] to read them off of the off of the the
[8:22] the view and and you know somebody calls
[8:24] or whatever they do and something goes
[8:26] wrong uh remember tonight the we're not
[8:28] live CA something wrong with the system
[8:31] okay so but it will be on tomorrow cuz
[8:34] we are videoing and everything all right
[8:37] now we were talking Sunday I mean
[8:40] Wednesday
[8:41] because we were started at a point of
[8:44] like marriage and
[8:46] divorce so we're starting on the point
[8:48] of just like what is a
[8:50] marriage and then we will get down to
[8:53] you know uh the word divorce on another
[8:57] message but
[9:00] I want you to think about what I've been
[9:02] trying to
[9:04] say you can say well we've been taught
[9:07] this we've been taught that all right
[9:09] and I believe it's this way
[9:12] okay by the Constitution of the United
[9:16] States you have a right to believe what
[9:19] you want to
[9:21] believe right but not by the
[9:24] Bible okay not by the Bible but by the
[9:28] con intution that gives us total right
[9:30] to believe what we want to believe but
[9:32] not by the Bible so that's why I always
[9:34] try to take everything back to what the
[9:36] Bible says and what the prophet says
[9:39] right and then uh if you have a
[9:41] different thoughts on it I will be glad
[9:43] to discuss it with you you know at any
[9:47] time and all like that because you know
[9:50] I'm open for any instructive that I can
[9:52] receive because it really helps me and
[9:55] all and I I I enjoy that receiving what
[9:58] people have to to say right but remember
[10:01] what we were bringing out
[10:03] that how that you're
[10:07] married not and we'll read it again in a
[10:10] little bit not by uh going down to the
[10:13] justice of peace are going to a preacher
[10:17] and vowing your
[10:19] vows you all you know and then the other
[10:23] things going with it but you're
[10:25] married as far as God is concerned when
[10:27] you're engaged right amen and we'll give
[10:31] that back over in a minute as to what
[10:33] you know the engaged part of it now I
[10:37] want to make something clear that I said
[10:39] last Wednesday that I thought about it
[10:42] later in kind of reviewing in my mind
[10:44] what I had said and I said that when you
[10:48] know that when before I would marry my
[10:49] wife I had some things that I had to
[10:51] confess to her you know right and uh but
[10:55] none of those things I had to confess to
[10:57] her was that I was I just dropped it and
[10:59] I do that a lot so people can make you
[11:02] say anything you want to that's okay
[11:04] that's that's your business cuz they're
[11:06] the one putting it to it and they're the
[11:07] ones going to have to back up when they
[11:09] hear what you say later you know but see
[11:11] I never was engaged to anybody right and
[11:14] and I certainly wasn't married in any
[11:16] form to anybody but I I was a boy as all
[11:20] boys and I don't how to explain that all
[11:24] right but I did explain to my wife even
[11:26] as a sinner I would not
[11:29] of marry her until I went through my
[11:32] life with her because I wanted no
[11:35] trouble down the road right all right
[11:38] and that was a wonderful thing to do and
[11:40] then come along and find out the prophet
[11:42] said that's what we should do so that
[11:44] was good you know I wonder how many of
[11:46] you have um you know
[11:50] confessed your rights and I mean your
[11:52] wrongs and things on both sides you know
[11:55] men and women right you know uh how many
[11:57] times you've been engaged people say
[11:59] well well I you know I've never been
[12:02] engaged uh because they they'll think
[12:04] engaged means that you you got some kind
[12:07] of a public
[12:09] announcement now the word engage and
[12:12] espoused and things is when you ask the
[12:14] girl to marry you and she accepts right
[12:17] yeah then that's a wedding as far as God
[12:21] is concerned right right all right you
[12:23] say well no we haven't done all these
[12:25] others we we'll read some more tonight
[12:27] but you just think about it that's why
[12:29] it's serious amen and we're going to get
[12:31] on to The
[12:33] Vow you know that a vow is so
[12:36] serious that a man there in the Bible
[12:38] one time
[12:40] vowed that if God would let him you know
[12:43] destroy his enemy that whatever came out
[12:46] to meet him on his way back we'll get to
[12:49] this he said I'll I'll sacrifice it to
[12:53] you and you know it was his daughter
[12:55] that came
[12:57] out and he sacrificed her to God that's
[13:01] how much his vow meant to him you say I
[13:04] wouldn't do that well then you claim to
[13:06] be a Christian right and this guy don't
[13:08] claim to be one that was back there he
[13:10] just vowed his vow and he believed it
[13:14] and he done what the vow was yeah all
[13:18] right see it it means a lot of things so
[13:20] just don't make a vow right and we'll
[13:22] try to cover things you know because I
[13:24] don't want you to misunderstand what I'm
[13:27] saying
[13:29] and and think about it that we say well
[13:32] a vow well you know you say
[13:35] well when when you go down to you know
[13:37] when the when you go to the to make your
[13:40] vows is what it's talking about well
[13:42] I'll read one in a minute where the
[13:43] Prophet said whether you made your
[13:46] vows you
[13:48] know like
[13:50] that or whether you live together what
[13:52] you married and he was talking about his
[13:55] own son right all right so then you know
[13:59] that would that would be
[14:01] a a bad thing because when I'm talking
[14:04] about vows now I'm not talking about
[14:07] when you come up before the preacher or
[14:09] the magistrate or whatever you know and
[14:11] they say do you take this to be no no
[14:14] I'm not talking about that now that is
[14:17] further into your vows that is what
[14:20] follows after your
[14:22] commitment or agreement right because
[14:26] you you've got to have it to where you
[14:28] can tie together with the entire world
[14:31] as far as what they're doing with their
[14:32] type of vows whether it's stepping over
[14:35] a stick you
[14:36] know I covered that Wednesday you know I
[14:40] mean they didn't just walk out there in
[14:42] the man way and grab a woman with hand
[14:43] and go step over a
[14:44] stick we stepped over a stick well
[14:47] you're and not married no that was a
[14:49] long period of time and very sacred
[14:52] things with them right know if that
[14:55] didn't stand the mergency test it was
[14:57] very serious wasn't it yeah
[14:59] in things all right but now see just
[15:02] remember what I'm trying to get you to
[15:04] think
[15:05] about that an
[15:09] engagement is an agreement right that's
[15:13] and the spouse or whatever you know
[15:14] you're doing so think on these things
[15:17] now and let's get started on it and
[15:18] listen to what the prophet had to say in
[15:22] this
[15:23] message we have but number one
[15:26] brother look what he say
[15:30] this is E18
[15:34] Fellowship let me get over I gave you
[15:37] this cuz I want you to take them home
[15:38] with
[15:39] you you know and and I want you to read
[15:42] on them and study it but look what he
[15:44] says you cannot be married without an
[15:47] agreement yep you cannot have a wife
[15:50] without some kind of an agreement and
[15:53] that agreement is based upon your vow so
[15:56] it wouldn't matter if it was the
[15:58] stepping over stick it wouldn't M matter
[16:01] in in in forms to where that it would
[16:03] even the uh pre-arranged weddings of
[16:06] foreign countries that that they go
[16:08] through that to pre-arrange their own
[16:11] children's weddings you know and doings
[16:14] and and all the different things it
[16:16] would cover everything see because it
[16:18] would go into uh an agreement now I made
[16:22] a statement there that I want to make
[16:24] sure you understand I said uh you know
[16:28] we've accepted Jesus Christ and he's
[16:30] accepted us I really said that backwards
[16:33] right it should have been he accepted us
[16:36] and we accepted him because he has
[16:39] accepted a lot of people he gave
[16:42] salvation to the
[16:43] world right everybody can come he called
[16:47] them everybody all right now some are
[16:50] going to accept him yeah well sure then
[16:52] he will accept them on end to the
[16:54] marital Parts
[16:56] yes but see what makes the pros stitute
[17:00] system a problem the denominationalism
[17:04] and things is see he gave them an
[17:08] invitation and they publicly State their
[17:11] confession that they've accepted him as
[17:14] their Savior and then go out and live
[17:17] with the
[17:17] devil right that's right the world of
[17:20] sin you know in the things and showing
[17:23] them that they're a prostitute and I
[17:25] I'll get to that more when we get down
[17:27] to the word divorce and the things like
[17:30] that and and I like what Wade said there
[17:32] the other day you know to two two two
[17:35] Christians married together there's no
[17:37] such thing as a divorce that's right
[17:39] where would you have it right you know
[17:41] two true Christians now I said it to way
[17:44] I meant it me it the way I said it at
[17:46] that time okay two true Christians young
[17:49] together not just this person and
[17:51] nothing over there you don't even talk
[17:53] about a divorce why would you right but
[17:56] the re said is a man and woman they
[17:57] divorce and he said he he joined them
[17:59] back together and redone their vows he
[18:01] said they went off and live single y
[18:04] back he said and come back together he
[18:06] said they was married the whole time
[18:08] that's right amen that they wasn't
[18:10] divorced they was married the whole time
[18:11] CU see there ain't no divorce no cuz I
[18:15] hope you caught on to what I was saying
[18:16] about it a wedding is a vow right right
[18:20] a divorce is to break that vow
[18:23] right that's what you're doing when you
[18:26] go in to apply for a divorce right
[18:28] you're breaking the vows you made amen
[18:32] and a separation to pull apart and that
[18:34] makes it into a divorce then is what we
[18:37] call it in our
[18:38] terminologies right see we deal with
[18:40] talking like that when the Bible's
[18:41] dealing with others but now follow what
[18:43] I'm trying to say now you cannot be
[18:46] married without an agreement that's
[18:48] right you cannot have a wife without
[18:49] some kind of agreement and that
[18:51] agreement is based upon your vow all
[18:54] right now good to see our brother back
[18:56] with us and you you know I covered last
[18:59] Wednesday as I
[19:00] said that to me the Bible the prophet's
[19:05] message is that when you're
[19:09] engaged as far as God is concerned
[19:12] you're married right now you go break
[19:14] that
[19:16] engagement Y and marry somebody
[19:19] else you're living in adultery amen I
[19:22] don't care if man or a woman right see
[19:25] that's what we pick on the woman all the
[19:26] time yep see we get into all the problem
[19:29] we want to beat the woman to death leave
[19:31] the man let him put a suit on his he's
[19:32] good
[19:33] brother no but see once you're
[19:36] engaged as far as God is concerned he's
[19:39] taking your word right they said Matthew
[19:42] there in the scripture says by your
[19:44] words you be justified by Your Word you
[19:46] be condemned right and like we just read
[19:49] from from Matthew
[19:51] 1 and read it word it you know it was
[19:54] fear not to take unto thee marry thy
[19:56] wife we want to read that way but it
[19:58] said and also in that same
[20:00] scripture thy husband right and see they
[20:04] were only a spouse because that's what
[20:05] the the scripture says that we're doing
[20:07] all right now let's go to the next one
[20:11] you say but now brother Dale uh we're
[20:14] we're we're
[20:15] engaged but we're not
[20:18] married so you're wanting to go on over
[20:21] and try to make your marriage some
[20:23] deeper
[20:24] point they are calling a marriage we're
[20:27] not living in America when we're talking
[20:30] in Bible terminologies right what we
[20:33] were taught to be a marriage now is see
[20:36] as I said you couldn't do this in a
[20:38] court of law in America right to go into
[20:42] a court of law and
[20:43] say she agreed to marry
[20:46] me well theyd laugh you out to court you
[20:49] know cuz they don't care what it is cuz
[20:52] their words are so much different and
[20:54] their doings they only to them the
[20:57] marriage is not even when you're
[20:58] standing up you're going through the
[21:00] vows through the world that's not even
[21:01] America it's when you go down and sign
[21:04] the
[21:05] paperwork you know and you make that
[21:08] sign seal that you're married and you go
[21:11] home and live together you know that's
[21:13] what the world calls a marriage but
[21:15] we're not talking we're talking about
[21:16] Bible amen all right so doing that look
[21:20] what the prophet
[21:22] said on the message invisible Union the
[21:24] Bride of Jesus Christ paragraph 83 look
[21:28] what he said Joseph fear not take unto
[21:30] thee Mary thy wife for that which is
[21:32] conceived in her it all the Holy Ghost
[21:34] he was minded to put her away privately
[21:38] see after he'd already engaged to her
[21:41] when you're engaged to her as far as God
[21:44] is concerned you're married to her all
[21:48] right when you're
[21:50] engaged all right not the vows at the
[21:52] pullit right you know or the pre the
[21:55] priest or you know whoever you made you
[21:58] you're I promise to you know you take
[22:00] this to be your awful no it's when
[22:02] you're engaged right all right so we use
[22:05] the words turn back on the front of your
[22:08] thing there
[22:11] and forgive me for coughing and
[22:16] everything thank the Lord for touching
[22:17] me amen uh finally went to the doctor
[22:21] and got some antibiotics but I buy
[22:23] Stripes I was healed before the
[22:24] antibiotics I thank God for antibiotics
[22:27] amen just we just get what we can I call
[22:29] it double that's what I said one time we
[22:31] was going to we come by my mothers I
[22:34] think it was and and one of the kids was
[22:37] sick and they said well you going to the
[22:38] doctor I said yeah we're going to the
[22:39] doctor we're going to church first and
[22:42] then we're going to the doctor you
[22:45] because that's what we believe we
[22:46] believe God's the HEB right right amen
[22:49] but look in Luke now we
[22:51] covered which is the same one but it's
[22:53] to to you know spouse to a virgin spouse
[22:56] to a man whose name was Joseph all right
[22:58] right that word ver uh espouse D is the
[23:01] Greek word
[23:04] 3423 which means a
[23:07] spouse and watch what it says to woo her
[23:12] and ask her in
[23:13] marriage to be promised in marriage be
[23:17] betro right all right now as I said when
[23:21] you when a boy asks a girl to marry him
[23:24] and the girl accepts then that's the
[23:26] vows brought that's their vows now if
[23:29] you ask a girl to marry you and she does
[23:32] not Excel that's not a wedding that's
[23:35] not an engagement right you know so
[23:38] don't go that way you know and people
[23:40] say well well I I asked her to marry me
[23:43] she's got to do
[23:44] it
[23:45] no that's not exactly no you know see
[23:50] it's when Joseph and Mary were a
[23:53] spoused y and by being a spoused then
[23:58] he had asked her to marry her I like
[24:01] that right there I like the way to woo
[24:04] her and ask her in
[24:07] marriage now that don't mean you walk up
[24:10] hey Daddy your honey dollar let's go get
[24:13] married no not not
[24:15] exactly not not that's not the word
[24:19] brother rown said Joseph and Mary would
[24:21] sat out on the porch after coming home
[24:23] from church and talk about the Bible
[24:26] Well it's going to get into that
[24:28] he going to get into the girls and the
[24:30] boys and the dating and what you should
[24:31] do and shouldn't do right all right you
[24:35] say well we already married well you
[24:37] might overthink about some of the things
[24:39] you've done back there right and ask the
[24:41] Lord as you made sure you cleared your
[24:43] record right amen and you might order
[24:45] ask your husband and your wife to make
[24:46] sure you cleared the record right right
[24:49] that's right I tell you one it' be bad
[24:52] well it's going to be bad if you don't
[24:54] because we're going to get down of that
[24:56] at a while where I read you to start
[24:58] with if you vow a vow and don't keep the
[25:01] vow it's sin right so go ahead then
[25:05] you'll see why brother randam said to
[25:08] the lady you
[25:09] know when she said if I tell my husband
[25:12] he he said God's already left you yep
[25:15] now that's what he said you going to
[25:16] read the message that's right he said
[25:18] he's already left you
[25:20] yep you said no wait a minute you
[25:22] putting no I'm putting what the prophet
[25:24] said right
[25:26] amen all right
[25:28] look at the next
[25:31] one let's see what the prophet had to
[25:33] say about this
[25:37] one what is it go to
[25:41] uh we still on the word of spouse go to
[25:43] 2 Corinthians
[25:46] 11:2 all right Paul is using the word
[25:49] jealous over you we Godly jealousy for I
[25:52] have
[25:55] espoused he had espoused the people back
[25:58] there which is you and I right if we're
[26:00] Christians he spoused us to Christ all
[26:02] right that Greek word means which is 718
[26:07] this is the New Testament the other
[26:08] one's an Old Testament right it means a
[26:11] spouse it means a join to fit together
[26:14] to betro a daughter to anyone to join to
[26:18] oneself in other words to marry the
[26:21] daughter of anyone to bet trol to give
[26:24] one in marriage to anyone right all
[26:28] right so it's holding with the right
[26:30] form right look at the next one which
[26:33] the word ESP spoused is used in the Old
[26:35] Testament in 2 Samuel
[26:38] 3:14 and David is talking about get my
[26:41] wife and bring her back over here
[26:43] remember sa's daughter and all because
[26:46] even though she done been married to a
[26:47] guy he said she was
[26:49] espoused and that word espouse is to
[26:51] betro
[26:53] 781 the Old Testament form engage
[26:58] to bet betro man or woman right to be
[27:03] betrothed to the word engaged now
[27:05] appears with a spouse and
[27:08] betol so then it must be the same word
[27:10] right amen coming all the way through
[27:12] right all right
[27:18] now let's
[27:21] see I gave go to Jeremiah
[27:25] 30 and you'll notice it uses the word
[27:30] engaged for who it is that engaged his
[27:33] heart in other words I gave that to just
[27:35] show you a man commits his heart he
[27:38] commits his that's called engaged right
[27:41] to commit something to agree to
[27:43] something to to to make it your own
[27:47] thought and idea right it turns out to
[27:50] be and that's what we was using that far
[27:52] because that's what it means it means to
[27:53] pledge exchange mortgage engage occupy
[27:57] undertake take far give
[27:58] pledges uh for shity to take a pledge or
[28:01] give a
[28:03] pledge see that's in your
[28:07] heart you say well now it wasn't in my
[28:09] heart when I asked that girl to marry me
[28:11] well that's probably about right it was
[28:13] in the flesh right but it still was
[28:16] dealing from the
[28:18] heart so that's that was why I used that
[28:21] one it just to that point all right so
[28:23] look at the next one which is
[28:25] Deuteronomy 22:23
[28:28] which is the word betro that was the
[28:30] word engage and here's the word betro if
[28:32] a down soul that is a virgin be betroth
[28:36] unto a husband and manf finder now we're
[28:38] going to get back to that scripture in a
[28:39] little bit but look what it says 3259 is
[28:42] the word to fix appoint assembly meet
[28:45] set betro to appoint assign designate to
[28:49] meet to meet by appointment together
[28:51] assemble by appointment to cause to meet
[28:54] to be set be pled placed before are to
[28:57] be fixed all right so the word betro the
[29:00] word engaged and the word
[29:03] espoused is the same word all right
[29:07] right
[29:11] now let's get down to the to the next
[29:14] one on our quotes
[29:15] now go down to number
[29:19] three let's just let the prophit be the
[29:22] answer to all of it this is paragraph
[29:25] 165 questions and answers number three 3
[29:27] 64 8:30 the morning service and watch
[29:31] what he
[29:32] says and I'd be a hypocrite if I stood
[29:35] here because my own son sitting here
[29:38] that was promised to a girl and I said
[29:40] it if if he never ever had the ceremony
[29:46] said over him yeah now read it if he
[29:50] never even had the ceremony set over him
[29:53] right no matter if he ever live with the
[29:57] the woman or slept with her the girl or
[30:02] whatever it was when he made that vow
[30:05] he's married Billy Paul or no Billy Paul
[30:07] that's actually the truth he's married
[30:08] when he made the
[30:11] promise and he refused he remember to do
[30:15] his son's wedding that's right that's
[30:17] how strong it was now but notice what he
[30:20] said if he never even had the ceremony
[30:22] said over him so there's your vows down
[30:24] here do you take this to be your law
[30:27] wted do you think that's your ceremony
[30:30] right no matter if he if he ever lived a
[30:34] woman or slept with it no
[30:38] matter they married
[30:41] right see we don't play on things on
[30:44] what we're trying to do here we try to
[30:45] be one straight things straighten if we
[30:47] can and I like it the way the prophet do
[30:49] it look at the next one number four the
[30:51] choosing of a
[30:53] bride if we would study what we're doing
[30:57] when we're going to get
[30:59] married when we choose our wife or
[31:01] husband if we'd study it over a man
[31:05] should pray earnestly for he could Ru
[31:07] his entire life right Remember The Vow
[31:10] is until death do we part now listen to
[31:14] this one real
[31:16] carefully and he could Ru his life by
[31:18] making the wrong choice but if he knows
[31:23] what
[31:24] really he making the wrong choice and is
[31:28] marrying a
[31:29] woman that isn't fit to be his wife and
[31:33] he does it anyhow
[31:37] y listen to
[31:40] it then it's his
[31:42] fault y
[31:46] right see you can't come along one of
[31:48] these days and claim ignorance at least
[31:50] now you can't I like one brother R said
[31:53] from now on you can't right you can't
[31:56] play it play it plead ignorance well I
[31:59] didn't know these
[32:02] things don't plead
[32:06] ignorance watch if the woman takes a
[32:09] husband and knows that he's not fit to
[32:12] be a husband to you then that's your own
[32:15] fault after you know what's right and
[32:18] wrong so you shouldn't do it until you
[32:21] thoroughly pray through right
[32:25] amen yep
[32:29] you see if you
[32:31] know it was wrong to marry the person
[32:35] you well I didn't know what was wrong to
[32:36] marry the
[32:38] person that's why I always tell
[32:41] you you know what I tell you any of you
[32:45] ever asked me to do your wedding I say
[32:46] what have you ever been engaged to
[32:49] either one of
[32:51] you is either one of you ever been
[32:56] married right then I say this to the
[32:59] husband and the wife the woman and the
[33:01] man sitting there now it's up to you to
[33:03] go explain your
[33:05] life cuz I have no right to to to ask
[33:09] her are you a virgin or ask him is he a
[33:11] virgin that's not that's not my
[33:13] responsibility that's what I'm telling
[33:14] you that's what he's telling you
[33:18] right so you join them people together
[33:21] knowing this that or the other it's like
[33:22] one brother said one time he said you
[33:24] married them people when it's wrong I
[33:26] said
[33:35] what I said you know
[33:37] it
[33:41] yeah
[33:43] y I said you was the best
[33:46] man so the sin's on you yep I didn't
[33:50] know
[33:53] it I said you got the problem and I said
[33:56] if I tell you you you remember in the
[33:58] wedding vow I said from now on keep your
[34:01] mouth
[34:02] shut that's what the wedding vow means
[34:05] when you're asking if anybody can say
[34:06] anything for reason if not forever hold
[34:08] your peace I said you're supposed to
[34:10] keep your mouth shut cuz you stood as
[34:12] the best
[34:13] man and didn't tell me about
[34:16] it see it was something else it wasn't
[34:19] the vows it wasn't but that's what I'm
[34:22] getting at
[34:23] see we we all had problems cuz we didn't
[34:26] know the truth right see we didn't know
[34:29] the truth it's the reason we done what
[34:31] we done amen but now does that dis know
[34:33] the truth
[34:35] no no it just made us all into problems
[34:42] right and and doing the best we can do
[34:44] about it but he said if we' have studied
[34:49] that he said if we have just to studi
[34:51] that
[34:53] out
[34:55] now
[34:57] let's go ahead we get the the two quotes
[35:00] out and then we'll drop back on what we
[35:01] were talking about on the vows brother
[35:03] brother Anderson so go ahead to number
[35:10] five now go ahead and go ahead to number
[35:13] five
[35:14] quote
[35:17] 30 165 4 five okay let's use this one
[35:23] all
[35:24] right I got something back here I got to
[35:26] read on rest but let's get these out
[35:27] read these out of the way and then we'll
[35:29] get this is questions and answers on of
[35:31] book three which is 6 830 the morning
[35:33] service paragraph
[35:35] 154 and said we were married 21 years
[35:38] ago by the justice of the peace was it
[35:40] wrong yes it was wrong for you to do
[35:43] that marriage belong in the house of God
[35:46] but being that you are married here's
[35:48] when you're really married you're
[35:50] married when you vow one to the other
[35:53] when you promise one another that you're
[35:56] that you'll take one another the justice
[35:58] of the peace could give you the license
[36:00] that's legal terms of living together as
[36:03] husband and wife without being common
[36:05] law husband and wife right but when you
[36:08] promise this girl and this you promise
[36:10] that man that you'll live true to him
[36:13] and you take him to be your husband
[36:15] you're married then you remember I
[36:17] explained that last week right so let's
[36:20] go on to the next
[36:23] one number six
[36:28] all right that was paragraph 150 this is
[36:32] paragraph
[36:33] 160 and as I say you got married by
[36:36] magistrate you should have been married
[36:38] by the church by the minister that's the
[36:41] decent thing for a Christian but being
[36:43] that you've already made that promise
[36:45] and vow and been married 21 years ago I
[36:48] think it's all right you say well I the
[36:51] question and this I just put this in
[36:53] here because I want you to think on this
[36:54] point listen the question might be
[36:57] should I come and be married again
[37:00] yeah now listen if you wish to
[37:04] right now here's the reason don't have
[37:08] nothing in your mind that bothers your
[37:14] faith you see what he saying cause if
[37:18] anything's D you can't go no further
[37:20] than right there you stop right
[37:23] there the best thing to do just get it
[37:25] out of the way
[37:28] we've had wedding vows renewed and all
[37:30] kind of things you know and he goes on
[37:32] to explain something about U they put
[37:35] him out of the church and different
[37:36] things like that cuz he wouldn't you
[37:38] know but he's explaining right don't get
[37:41] nothing in the way right yeah and we've
[37:44] done it we've had marriage renewed
[37:47] marriage vows renewed you know and
[37:49] that's
[37:50] fine CU it be
[37:52] good you know to keep everything in the
[37:54] right order cuz we should shouldn't have
[37:57] it that way all right let's pick them up
[37:59] and
[38:00] get the last two and then
[38:03] we'll start back on it so this is parag
[38:06] look at number number
[38:08] seven paragraph 193 91 through 99
[38:11] through 97 theying offer questions and
[38:14] answers real to 8:23 in the evening said
[38:18] brother Brandon what is the meaning of
[38:22] an are people free to marry or is it
[38:25] just another word for divorce
[38:27] I'd like some information on that on
[38:29] this so you'd say well
[38:31] an they had an an because that's what
[38:35] brother brandham and the girl's father
[38:37] done I can show you that in the message
[38:40] brother brandham and his and the girl's
[38:41] father had their wedding an olded of
[38:44] Billy Paul and the girl that he married
[38:46] to but he was married see right sure
[38:49] they're married as long as they take
[38:50] that vow they're married just like a boy
[38:52] if a boy promises a girl to marry her
[38:54] under good faith he's obligated to let
[38:56] girl he's just as good as married her
[38:59] the only thing that the law does is give
[39:00] you a Bill of Rights to live together to
[39:02] keep from being common law husband and
[39:04] wife but when a man tells a woman I will
[39:07] marry you honey I will take you for my
[39:09] wife will you take he's married your vow
[39:13] is sacred that's what marries you anyhow
[39:17] there's not no preacher can marry you no
[39:21] magistrate or nothing else it's your own
[39:24] vow to God and to this man when you
[39:27] promise you are
[39:30] married lookie you say brother brandom
[39:33] is that you say you said you'd only
[39:35] answer that by the
[39:37] Bible did you want the Bible on it raise
[39:39] your hands if you want it now we got six
[39:42] or eight minutes all right Joseph her
[39:44] husband being a just man her espoused
[39:46] husband already called her husband
[39:50] Joseph her
[39:51] husband being a just man was mindly
[39:55] mindly to put her away privately on this
[39:59] wise but before they came together she
[40:01] was found with child of the Holy Ghost
[40:02] see and the angel of the Lord appeared
[40:04] unto him in a dream and saying Joseph
[40:06] thy son of David Fe not to take unto
[40:08] thee marry thy wife already married he'd
[40:11] already promised her all right what and
[40:15] of and little lady if you promise to
[40:17] marry that boy you're obligated to do it
[40:20] if you marry another after that
[40:22] obligation you will from now on anyhow
[40:25] you'll be living in adultery and notice
[40:28] the thing same thing to a boy promising
[40:30] to marry a woman don't you make your vow
[40:33] to anybody L you mean to stick with it
[40:36] remember there's the Bible for it Joseph
[40:38] promised to marry Mary and God said that
[40:42] that was read the Old Testament laws on
[40:44] that the Old Testament law if you
[40:46] promised to marry a woman and you
[40:48] married another one you was committing
[40:50] adultery and it throws you out of the
[40:52] camp yes sir you have to keep your vows
[40:56] when when you promise to a woman that
[40:58] she's a sacred little vessel and that's
[41:00] to her that's to bring child life into
[41:04] the world again so when you promise her
[41:08] you must marry her that's right now
[41:10] we'll get to some of these quotes later
[41:11] on because of the divorcement situation
[41:14] and brother Brandon been referring back
[41:16] to that while ago whether you marry a
[41:18] woman and knowing that you know that he
[41:21] even said it like this one time he said
[41:24] if you married a woman and knowing there
[41:27] problem that you can't divorce her for
[41:29] the problem that's right amen that's
[41:33] right what he say
[41:36] right it goes on what you
[41:38] know goes on that point look at the last
[41:41] one then we'll get down to the V okay we
[41:43] have seen a star in the east and come to
[41:46] worship this is 1963
[41:50] 1216 now I'd like to pass this on before
[41:53] you go further espousing in the East was
[41:56] the the same as marriage is
[41:59] betral as soon as they as they were
[42:01] espoused they were married when that
[42:03] sacred vow between them was taken read
[42:07] Deuteronomy
[42:08] 22:23 and you'll find out that when this
[42:11] young woman and man agreed to be married
[42:14] yet they did not take the vows for
[42:17] months later now notice it he didn't
[42:20] take the vows for months
[42:22] later and he's talking about up before
[42:25] the people the V you know they done
[42:27] promised right if they even broke that
[42:31] vow they were guilty of adultery that's
[42:33] right when they were espoused they were
[42:35] just the same as marriage the law had
[42:38] not given them rights to live together
[42:41] as husband and wife yet but before God
[42:44] when they promised one another their
[42:47] words were sealed in God's Kingdom right
[42:49] and a break that was just committing
[42:51] adultery and now Joseph was a spouse to
[42:54] Mary if minister brothers and if you'd
[42:57] studied that right good it'd clear you
[43:00] up on this marriage and divorce
[43:04] case that's so so hard and different
[43:08] amongst the people today and notice
[43:10] Joseph her husband being a just man see
[43:13] now we find out that this could be not
[43:15] be broken all right
[43:18] now you're
[43:22] vows you're married by your vows amen
[43:25] right
[43:28] the word engaged espoused betr every how
[43:33] you pronounce those words
[43:36] betro comes out to be the same
[43:43] thing your vow right that you made your
[43:48] Arrangement your agreement all right you
[43:51] made that all right so
[43:55] now let's go over to something as I said
[43:58] a vow is so sacred until you'll find it
[44:02] in 1st Samuel
[44:04] 1:11 that Hannah vowed a vow unto the
[44:07] Lord and SEL when he was weaned was
[44:10] given unto Eli I believe the right the
[44:13] priest ever given to him to raise
[44:16] because she made a vow
[44:19] right you didn't just make a vow and it
[44:22] just you know in America words are cheap
[44:25] somebody make a vow I promise that don't
[44:27] do it in America get it wrote down in
[44:31] and signed by the judge and make sure
[44:33] the judge is a good judge if you can get
[44:36] the judge you get the judge to sign the
[44:38] judge you know yeah you know what I'm
[44:40] saying cuz in
[44:43] America people's words worth nothing
[44:46] right amen I told you about the time I
[44:48] sold my house and my brother come and
[44:51] offer me $5,000 profit and all I'd done
[44:53] is give my nephew word that I'd sell it
[44:56] to him he said you ain't signed nothing
[44:59] I said my word's worth more than $5,000
[45:01] get on
[45:03] yeah and that was a time when $5,000
[45:06] that was
[45:08] 1972 $55,000 meant a lot of money then
[45:12] right but you see if your word is not no
[45:16] good talk is cheap yeah but remember
[45:20] you're going to give the Bible says an
[45:22] account for every Idol word amen
[45:26] that's
[45:29] right that's why it doesn't make no
[45:31] difference I have to have here rules
[45:33] regulations said I'm
[45:35] pastor and I must go by those things
[45:40] right even though I might not agree with
[45:42] them as far as wanting it to be
[45:44] done but it's according to the pastor
[45:47] right according what the Bible said I'm
[45:48] supposed to do right as Reon I do the
[45:50] way I
[45:53] do but you see then a
[45:57] vow now as I said while ago a vow is
[46:01] not to wait until you come down and make
[46:05] your
[46:05] vows right you know where you you
[46:08] standing before the preacher or the or
[46:10] the magistrate or whatever and you take
[46:12] this woman me that that's part that's a
[46:15] vow that's a word
[46:17] vow now when we read this here in the
[46:20] scriptures we're going to read something
[46:23] that people want to use for their own
[46:25] benefit
[46:27] you know in making a vow but just
[46:30] remember as I said in judges 11:
[46:33] 31-34 right in there verse chapter in
[46:36] judges 11 you'll find a man vowed to
[46:39] give whatever come out first and his
[46:40] daughter come out and he killed her
[46:43] right that's what a v meant to people
[46:46] right that's why I read there in the
[46:49] scripture when we started that if you
[46:51] vow a vow to
[46:54] God
[46:56] yep and you break the vow that's
[47:02] sin it's sin that's scripture that's
[47:05] plain language it ain't nice things a
[47:08] lot of times to talk
[47:11] about but who wants nice
[47:14] things I'm going to tell you this
[47:16] because I've told you many times this
[47:18] way I have never dechristianize anybody
[47:21] for double marriages Etc any kind of
[47:24] thing but but I'll tell you up front in
[47:27] plain language there ain't going to be
[47:29] no change of the body now I'm talking
[47:30] about change the moment the twink of an
[47:32] eye I'm not talking about going by the
[47:34] grave get that out of your mind going by
[47:37] the grave and come up y that's one thing
[47:41] there's not going to be a bride standing
[47:43] here changing a moment and twinkling an
[47:45] eye that's got a marital problem of any
[47:46] kind right amen believe whether it be
[47:50] natural or spiritual
[47:54] right so don't tell me that all these
[47:56] two Soul seven thund virtue peruses
[47:58] River Jordan etc etc that all that's
[48:00] going in Rapture
[48:04] no how you going inter Rapture with
[48:06] false Doctrine right that's why it's
[48:09] been put off so long waiting on somebody
[48:13] to get stapled on the word
[48:15] right amen 40 something years we've had
[48:18] to get settled in the
[48:20] word right we ought to be able to say
[48:22] something about marriage and divorce
[48:24] after that but you know that 9 % of the
[48:26] preachers that's message won't even
[48:27] touch marriage and divorce
[48:30] right the ones that does 90% of that 90%
[48:33] he got it all garbage Canned Up
[48:37] amen till the man can go out and just
[48:39] have all the wi he wants but the woman
[48:42] she's she's still you
[48:45] know all right but a v let's go in the
[48:49] scriptures now just take something that
[48:50] people want to
[48:53] use go to numbers
[49:00] 30 now before I start on
[49:06] this all right it says if a woman off so
[49:11] vow a vow unto the Lord and bind herself
[49:14] by a bond being in her father's house in
[49:18] her youth that's right remember youth
[49:23] that's right yes
[49:26] doesn't say she's 90 years
[49:29] old this is the headship of do it but
[49:32] look what the word v mean to vow make a
[49:35] vow to vow a
[49:37] vow all right now this is not just
[49:41] talking about marriage and divorce no
[49:43] that's right it's talking about all
[49:46] forms of vow right but it is also
[49:49] talking about marriage and divorce and
[49:51] the basis that she's making her vow
[49:54] right all
[49:57] right whether you believe what I'm
[49:58] saying or not do you understand what I'm
[50:00] saying right when we read this it's it
[50:03] doesn't say any here that she she vowed
[50:05] to marry a
[50:09] husband it just says she made a vow
[50:14] right all right and it it it it'll lean
[50:19] on over to where we can understand all
[50:23] right let's start with
[50:28] let's start with verse
[50:30] one all right you got it from numbers
[50:32] the V let's go to to numbers 30th
[50:36] chapter go ahead brother pull it up
[50:39] we'll start with verse
[50:41] one I may not have marked that for them
[50:43] to use
[50:49] really it'll be up there but you go
[50:51] ahead and turn to it in your Bible and
[50:52] we'll get we'll get started on it okay
[50:56] and watch Moses SP un the heads of the
[50:58] tribes concerning the children of Israel
[50:59] saying this is the thing that the Lord
[51:01] hath commanded all right now we
[51:05] got and if a man vow vow unto the
[51:09] Lord or swear an oath to bind his soul
[51:12] with a bond he shall not break his word
[51:16] he shall do according to all that
[51:18] proceedeth out of his
[51:20] mouth and if a woman also vow vow unto
[51:23] the Lord and bind herself by Bond being
[51:26] in her father's house in her Youth and
[51:28] what that's
[51:30] right now watch's the headship that W
[51:33] was preaching about the the man being
[51:35] the head right here we go and the
[51:37] husband being the head and watch it when
[51:39] we get on down here that a widow and and
[51:42] a divorce woman don't even have a head
[51:45] no there's nobody to disallow their vows
[51:49] right but they don't have a head all
[51:52] right yeah if I have time to get there
[51:56] but what and if a woman also a vow vow
[51:58] to the Lord being in her father's house
[52:00] and her Youth and her father hear her
[52:03] vow and her bond where with she hath
[52:05] bound her soul and her father shall hold
[52:08] his peace at her then all her vows shall
[52:12] stand and every Bond
[52:14] wherewith she hath bound her soul shall
[52:18] stand all right now as I said it doesn't
[52:22] say that she married to marry does it
[52:25] right
[52:27] but see the same people that would
[52:30] rebuke try to rebuke me of saying it
[52:32] don't say nothing about married you let
[52:34] one of their kids get in trouble and
[52:35] down hear about four verses they run
[52:37] back real quick and say this is talking
[52:39] about fou of a wedding
[52:42] yeah come on we'll get down to
[52:46] that you trying to say well that's not
[52:48] it it's not it's don't matter all V
[52:50] that's right that's right amen of of a
[52:55] father has a right to break a vow of a
[52:57] daughter
[52:59] sure right now would it be something
[53:03] Danny let's give it a couple
[53:05] illustrations natural so showing the
[53:07] vows of a vow you know just a vow what
[53:09] did Hope come along and said
[53:12] Daddy I vowed to give all the money that

[53:26] I done sign the
[53:33] paperwork uhuh now
[53:35] daughter you ain't capable of doing that
[53:38] now you might be able to fagle a little
[53:41] out of the checking account yeah but
[53:44] we're going to solve this problem right
[53:46] now right
[53:50] right
[53:53] all G's not here but still he'll hear
[53:56] this
[53:57] later what if Little B there said Daddy
[54:01] I made a
[54:07] vow I I'm going to become a
[54:17] nun what she might have V cuz people
[54:20] talk her into making a v right but the
[54:24] daddy can say hold it just a minute now
[54:26] you don't understand what you're saying
[54:27] daughter do you know what it means to be
[54:29] a nun do you know or you taking no I
[54:31] didn't consider all that Daddy I didn't
[54:33] know that all went with it he's
[54:36] childish
[54:38] right but he's capable of breaking that
[54:42] vow that's
[54:44] right any any kind of vow you
[54:51] vow you know get on down to the little
[54:53] bitty kids and
[54:58] yeah that's right little Olivia she
[55:01] comes in and said
[55:03] daddy said I made a
[55:06] vow said I'm going to clean the
[55:10] teacher's room every
[55:12] day after
[55:19] school I'm sure that what Joe would say
[55:23] then wait just a minute ain't no problem
[55:24] about you cleaning school you know
[55:26] cleaning the room up but uh who's going
[55:28] to come and get you after school's over
[55:31] and bring you
[55:32] home you have vow to
[55:37] vow now you know what people do with
[55:40] doing those thing
[55:43] right you know that these preachers on
[55:45] their radios and TVs and things they get
[55:48] you to make a vow that you'll send them
[55:51] so much
[55:52] money bud you better not let down on
[55:56] that they're going to send you a nice
[55:59] little letter and about three letters
[56:02] they going to tell you what a filthy
[56:03] garbage can you are for not keeping your
[56:06] vow cuz you vowed to God and God can
[56:10] rain down HS on you
[56:13] and destroy you and you know what I'm
[56:16] talking about so it's not all marriage
[56:19] vows right it's all
[56:22] vows that's right
[56:26] see the father can dis all the vow
[56:29] that's
[56:31] right all
[56:33] right now let's bring it back up to
[56:35] where we're at
[56:38] now let's use it for what we're talking
[56:41] about
[56:42] now a boy ask a girl to marry her and
[56:45] I'm talking about a youth Now Youth now
[56:47] you going have to AR get what youth
[56:49] means that's all right you youth all you
[56:51] want to but the best definition for me
[56:53] is youth is a kid don't have enough
[56:55] sense to come in out of the
[56:57] rain they may be 40 years
[57:03] old now what's your definition of
[57:06] Youth 10 12 13 years old whatever sh
[57:09] fine
[57:11] right but you understand what I'm
[57:15] saying a youth is
[57:17] involved but now there's got to be
[57:19] certain things are that or that cannot
[57:23] be done so now let's get into it all
[57:25] right go ahead brother pull him back
[57:29] up
[57:34] right and her
[57:36] father hear her vow and her bond
[57:39] wherewith she have found her
[57:43] soul she comes in she says mama daddy
[57:46] you know so and so asked me to marry him
[57:48] and I accepted
[57:50] him so now according to y'all's teaching
[57:53] we're
[57:53] engaged so what does the father
[57:58] do if he hears The Vow she done and her
[58:01] father shall hold his peace at her y
[58:06] then all her vows shall
[58:09] stand and every Bond where where she ha
[58:11] bound her soul she stand right if he
[58:14] holds his peace
[58:16] right if he don't say nothing right then
[58:20] her vought to marry the boy is an
[58:22] engagement amen all right now
[58:25] but if her father dis allow her in the
[58:32] day that he heard hear
[58:36] it now remember that recorded the day he
[58:40] hear it not 6 months later and you've
[58:43] already made wedding engagements and got
[58:45] all of the paraphernalia set up and and
[58:47] you got all the dates set and everything
[58:49] else and the guy comes along said you
[58:51] ain't going to marry that boy now we're
[58:53] not dumb
[58:55] right the Bible says in the day that he
[58:59] heareth in other words he must
[59:02] immediately upon hearing it
[59:06] right
[59:07] right that
[59:10] illustrate he's going on hunting trip
[59:13] he's going to be gone a couple of weeks
[59:15] boy ask a girl girl accept the boy mama
[59:18] knows about it they talk about well we
[59:21] going to be married we'll tell Daddy
[59:22] when he gets
[59:23] here and when Daddy comes home 2 weeks
[59:25] later that's the day he hear it
[59:29] yeah and he said no you're not going to
[59:32] do
[59:33] it
[59:35] right see watch what
[59:38] happens but if her father disallow her
[59:41] in the day that he Hearth not any of her
[59:43] vows or of her bonds wherewith she hath
[59:46] bound her soul shall stand and the Lord
[59:50] shall forgive her yep because her father
[59:54] disallowed her
[59:55] her that's wonderful amen yes sir to
[1:00:00] think of what the headship can do amen
[1:00:02] cuz you know that he just allowed our
[1:00:05] amen yes sir you want go
[1:00:08] spiritual amen listen and she had it all
[1:00:12] in husband when she
[1:00:16] vowed now so you're not going to totally
[1:00:19] into marual vows and different things
[1:00:21] but just a vow she vowed or uttered all
[1:00:24] out of her lips where with she bound her
[1:00:26] soul and her husband heard it and held
[1:00:28] his peace at her in it that day that he
[1:00:31] heard it then her vow shall stand and
[1:00:33] her bonds where with she bound her soul
[1:00:36] shall
[1:00:38] stand it's the headship of the man the
[1:00:41] husband all right but if her husband
[1:00:45] disallowed her on the day that he heard
[1:00:50] it not 6 months later now not oh honey I
[1:00:54] finally made made up my mind you told me
[1:00:56] this 6 months ago I get out here say
[1:00:58] garbage can we're talking about
[1:00:59] immediate things we're not talking about
[1:01:01] living
[1:01:02] garbage right then he shall make her
[1:01:05] vows which she then he shall make her
[1:01:08] vows which she vowed and that which she
[1:01:10] uttered with her lips where where she
[1:01:12] her soul was bound of none effect and
[1:01:14] the Lord shall forgive her that's right
[1:01:17] now look cuz headships got to go amen
[1:01:19] but every vow the
[1:01:22] Widow watch it now and her that is
[1:01:25] divorced where with they have bound
[1:01:26] their souls she'll stand against
[1:01:30] her that's what strong vows did see she
[1:01:33] don't have a
[1:01:36] headship and she vowed in her husband's
[1:01:39] house or bound her soul by a bond with
[1:01:41] an
[1:01:43] oath
[1:01:46] right and her husband heard it and held
[1:01:48] his peace in her and disallowed her not
[1:01:51] then all her vows shall stand and every
[1:01:52] BN where with she had bound her soul
[1:01:54] will stand but if her husband you know
[1:01:57] yep H him every bow all right
[1:02:02] now think about
[1:02:05] it suppose a girl does agree to marry a
[1:02:09] boy boy accepts and she and like way
[1:02:13] said it's a good point we're in the days
[1:02:15] now when the girls ask the boy to
[1:02:16] married but that don't put a headship
[1:02:17] over her no right cuz that's not
[1:02:21] scripture scripture is for the boy to
[1:02:22] ask the girl amen yeah
[1:02:25] that's the scriptural point and order to
[1:02:27] be nice point for anybody today you know
[1:02:28] I mean
[1:02:30] that's but suppose but your daughter
[1:02:33] comes in and tells you you say well a
[1:02:35] boy asked me to
[1:02:36] marry and I accept
[1:02:40] it you immediately can stop that from
[1:02:43] being a wedding right or an
[1:02:46] engagement cuz remember if you leave it
[1:02:48] alone they're married that's
[1:02:53] right
[1:02:55] you leave it alone they're marri right
[1:02:58] yep
[1:03:00] right so you you got to do something
[1:03:02] quick
[1:03:04] Y and I emphasize people you know they
[1:03:06] come along and they say
[1:03:10] well and I don't know this happened that
[1:03:14] people make wedding plans and everything
[1:03:15] in the world and the daddy come along
[1:03:17] and said I just allow The Vow y now that
[1:03:21] is play your games with your own toys
[1:03:24] yeah don't play with the word of God
[1:03:27] right the day you hear it cut it off
[1:03:31] amen immediately you say no right all
[1:03:35] right now God will honor that and
[1:03:38] there's not a wedding there right even
[1:03:41] though they have made their vows that's
[1:03:44] right because he has disallowed that
[1:03:49] yep God disallowed our
[1:03:52] vows because you were whether you want
[1:03:54] to believe it or not we vowed to serve
[1:03:56] Satan amen that's right yes
[1:04:00] sir and God dis Aline our
[1:04:03] vows CU you realize how young our minds
[1:04:08] are you understand what I'm getting
[1:04:11] at but what is a wedding an engagement
[1:04:14] an espousal a
[1:04:16] betrothal a vow that you
[1:04:19] make is what joins you together right
[1:04:22] man we read Word the prophet said it
[1:04:24] don't matter where they ever live
[1:04:25] together what
[1:04:27] Yep they're
[1:04:32] married it's serious when we read the
[1:04:37] Bible it's not a play party right it's
[1:04:41] serious let's see I was going to wait on
[1:04:43] another one but let's go let's see if I
[1:04:45] got that
[1:04:51] one yeah turn over Deuteronomy I didn't
[1:04:53] give these to them that's
[1:04:56] so but I'm going to use this this will
[1:04:59] be used mainly for
[1:05:02] divorce when we get into that which will
[1:05:04] be the next service we do the Lord
[1:05:06] willing all right turn over to
[1:05:08] Deuteronomy
[1:05:11] 22 and let's read a few things and just
[1:05:14] make sure we keep everything good and
[1:05:17] straight
[1:05:23] right CU we use these when we get down
[1:05:25] to divorce to show that a man can put
[1:05:27] his wife away right or put his
[1:05:29] girlfriend away when he finds her wrong
[1:05:31] in
[1:05:32] her but he better be right in what he
[1:05:35] does he better do it with the
[1:05:40] Bible
[1:05:42] okay Deuteronomy 22:9 we'll
[1:05:45] start um we don't need to start let's go
[1:05:50] uh
[1:05:51] 13 If any man take a wife and go in unto
[1:05:54] her and hate her and give occasions of
[1:05:56] speech against her and bring up an evil
[1:05:59] name upon her and say I took this woman
[1:06:02] and when I came to her I found her not a
[1:06:04] maid in other words you understand what
[1:06:06] he's saying I found her not to be a
[1:06:09] virgin right you
[1:06:13] understand then shall the father of the
[1:06:15] dsel and the mother take the take and
[1:06:18] bring forth the tokens of The danil's
[1:06:20] Virginity unto the Elders of the city in
[1:06:23] the gate a lot of people try to make out
[1:06:25] a lot of things it's all
[1:06:29] right it's proof anyway right sure you
[1:06:34] can do what you want to and I just wrote
[1:06:36] mine on our first night's bed sheet
[1:06:38] that'll be plain
[1:06:40] enough
[1:06:42] okay now D's father she'll say unto the
[1:06:45] elders I gave my daughter unto this man
[1:06:47] to to wife and he hated her and lo he
[1:06:50] had given occasion of speech against her
[1:06:52] saying I found not thy daughter my made
[1:06:55] and yet these are the tokens of my
[1:06:57] daughter's virginity and they shall
[1:07:00] spread the cloth before the Elders of
[1:07:02] the
[1:07:03] city and the Elders of that City shall
[1:07:05] take that man and chastise
[1:07:09] him now watch how strict your rules
[1:07:13] are they shall amense him in 100 SI make
[1:07:17] him pay 100 shickles of silver and give
[1:07:20] them unto the father of the dsel because
[1:07:22] he has brought up an evil name upon a
[1:07:25] virgin of Israel and she shall be his
[1:07:27] wife and he may not put her away all his
[1:07:34] days we're going to find out divorce is
[1:07:36] not because you cooked the bread
[1:07:39] wrong you
[1:07:42] know don't play with words right but
[1:07:45] watch then but if this thing be true and
[1:07:49] the tokens of virginity be not found for
[1:07:51] the dsel then they shall bring her out
[1:07:54] of the bring out the damel to the door
[1:07:56] of her father's house and the men of her
[1:07:58] City shall Stone her with stones that
[1:08:01] she die because she has brought Folly in
[1:08:04] Israel to play the in her father's
[1:08:05] house so shalt thou put evil away from
[1:08:08] among you right pretty strong is it y
[1:08:13] now
[1:08:14] watch if a man be found lying with a
[1:08:17] woman married to a
[1:08:22] husband then they shall both they shall
[1:08:25] both of them die both the man that lay
[1:08:27] with a woman and a woman so shalt thou
[1:08:30] put away evil from Israel watch if a
[1:08:34] damel that is a virgin be
[1:08:37] betro
[1:08:39] right unto a husband and a man find her
[1:08:42] in the city and lie with her and you
[1:08:45] shall bring them both out un to the gate
[1:08:48] of the city now notice where it's at now
[1:08:50] read your scripture where's it at and it
[1:08:52] answer that is a virgin be betrothed to
[1:08:54] a husband and a man find her in the city
[1:08:58] and lie with her then you shall bring
[1:09:01] them both out unto the Gate of that City
[1:09:04] and you shall stone with them them with
[1:09:06] stones that they die the damel because
[1:09:09] she cried not see she's in the city
[1:09:11] somebody could have heard her right
[1:09:13] right being in the city and the man
[1:09:16] because he had humbled his neighbor's
[1:09:18] wife so Thou shalt put away evil from
[1:09:22] among you now let me stop right here and
[1:09:25] say something
[1:09:27] plain that's telling you that she's in
[1:09:30] the city and if she cried she'd be
[1:09:33] hurt
[1:09:35] right but
[1:09:38] now God is always straight and
[1:09:41] honest what if the guy knocked her
[1:09:45] out where's he going to
[1:09:52] fly
[1:09:56] I'm the pastor I have to answer these
[1:09:58] questions CU somebody would come up with
[1:10:00] a question and say well what is so and
[1:10:02] so so and so all right I'll just
[1:10:03] discover the so and
[1:10:07] so you know it's still exactly right in
[1:10:09] the scripture but as quick as she wakes
[1:10:12] up she's going to
[1:10:14] cry and somebody in the city is going to
[1:10:16] hear her right right does that take care
[1:10:20] of that
[1:10:21] problem you say well well why did
[1:10:24] something happen do something
[1:10:27] happened if he bound her gaged
[1:10:31] her as quick as she got
[1:10:34] loose she
[1:10:38] cried not 3 days later now you know
[1:10:41] after she's
[1:10:44] done quick as she got able to she cried
[1:10:47] she's in the city somebody could hear
[1:10:48] her so the main thing is what she's in
[1:10:50] the city and somebody would hear her cry
[1:10:53] right and go to her eight now go to the
[1:10:55] next
[1:10:58] thing but if a man find a betro damel in
[1:11:01] the
[1:11:02] field now remember both of these died if
[1:11:07] they if they don't cry out but if a man
[1:11:09] find a betro damel in the field and the
[1:11:11] Man force her and lie with her then the
[1:11:14] man only that lay with her shall
[1:11:18] die now the reason is saying that is
[1:11:20] because she's outside the city she's out
[1:11:22] in the country
[1:11:25] right right he's out in the country
[1:11:28] nobody already here that's simple
[1:11:30] terminology is what the Bible speaking
[1:11:32] of right but put it down more into
[1:11:35] simpler terms of
[1:11:37] us if he raped
[1:11:41] her my know surpris we brought in this
[1:11:43] message one time we were going down the
[1:11:44] road and he said you mean you don't
[1:11:46] believe that a rape would cause a person
[1:11:48] to be married I said
[1:11:51] no a woman gets raped that doesn't mean
[1:11:53] she's married to the
[1:11:55] guy he raped
[1:11:58] her it puts in the tempate category
[1:12:00] that's what this scripture
[1:12:02] saying she's out where she can't cry but
[1:12:05] as quick as she can
[1:12:07] cry why because it tells you what
[1:12:09] happened but under the dsel Thou shalt
[1:12:11] do nothing there is in the dsel no sin
[1:12:14] worthy of death whereas when a man rises
[1:12:16] against his neighbor and SLE him even so
[1:12:19] is this all right he found her in the
[1:12:21] field and Danel cried and D was none to
[1:12:25] save her so what do you do you kill him
[1:12:28] right right
[1:12:30] right simple may not say the words right
[1:12:33] there what you do to you kill it you not
[1:12:36] solve a lot of
[1:12:39] problems but then we have to turn around
[1:12:41] and say we don't believe in capital
[1:12:44] punishment I got no idea about
[1:12:47] that it's cating that takes care of the
[1:12:50] whole
[1:12:51] problem well people don't talk to me
[1:12:54] about my
[1:12:56] terminology the gu's guilty cating me he
[1:12:59] don't no problem nobody ever ever
[1:13:04] after then if he's wounded in Stones he
[1:13:07] can't even come back to congregation so
[1:13:08] you really put the guy
[1:13:12] out but what are you going to say see
[1:13:14] she this this one here the one in the
[1:13:16] city somebody could hear her this one
[1:13:21] out nobody can't hear her she cries but
[1:13:24] what happens as quick as she sees
[1:13:26] somebody she
[1:13:28] cries let just go kill the
[1:13:36] guy you remember what the brothers done
[1:13:39] when that fell there took one of the
[1:13:42] daughters of who was it David's
[1:13:45] daughter and was it David he took him
[1:13:49] and you know he wanted to marry he raped
[1:13:51] her in other words and he want to marry
[1:13:54] her boy the law just took care of that
[1:13:58] problem you know the story what you
[1:14:01] done oh yeah we won't be one of you we
[1:14:04] we won't come in okay you got to be
[1:14:05] circumcised so they just circumcised all
[1:14:07] the guys and while they was in their
[1:14:10] circumcision and couldn't fight too good
[1:14:12] the brothers just got together and wiped
[1:14:13] all the men out and killed the old boy
[1:14:16] right David didn't like it but he
[1:14:18] couldn't argue with him about
[1:14:20] it because it was the law
[1:14:25] they raped a girl or he raped a girl you
[1:14:29] see what it's talking about now what the
[1:14:36] other if a man find a damel that is a
[1:14:39] virgin which is not
[1:14:42] betro and lay hold on her and lie with
[1:14:45] her and they be found okay no where
[1:14:50] somebody knows about it when the man
[1:14:52] that lay now this is one that's not a
[1:14:54] man find a dam that is a virgin which is
[1:14:57] not betr not
[1:14:59] engaged all
[1:15:02] right and lay hold on her and lie with
[1:15:04] her they be found then the man that lay
[1:15:07] with her shall give unto the dam of his
[1:15:09] father 50 s of silver silver and she
[1:15:11] shall be his wife because he had humbled
[1:15:14] her he may not put her away all his days
[1:15:18] now brother R said it don't matter what
[1:15:19] she does that's the scripture he's using
[1:15:21] he said it doesn't matter what she does
[1:15:23] went home couldn't do it yep why because
[1:15:25] he caused the
[1:15:29] prop and a man shall not take his
[1:15:32] father's wife nor discover his father's
[1:15:34] skirt do you
[1:15:37] understand vows are serious acts are
[1:15:42] serious
[1:15:47] right why don't we want to be right amen
[1:15:50] that's
[1:15:51] right but why are we not willing enough
[1:15:54] to stand up to the fact of admitting
[1:15:56] we're
[1:15:57] wrong and saying God have
[1:16:03] mercy oh I'm born again it don't matter
[1:16:05] what I done back
[1:16:10] there that's the biggest lie I've ever
[1:16:13] heard well you don't believe the new
[1:16:15] birth takes care of
[1:16:19] everything why would brother R say that
[1:16:21] if a woman comes to you tells you 10
[1:16:23] years after you
[1:16:25] married you got a right to that she was
[1:16:27] untrue to you you got a right to put her
[1:16:29] away and marry again he
[1:16:33] said we don't BR those
[1:16:38] clothes you see church it's not playtime
[1:16:41] right that's
[1:16:43] it it's not just
[1:16:48] playtime we'll come back to this and
[1:16:52] doing it but if you want to go on over
[1:16:54] one more scripture
[1:16:57] right and talk about when a man had
[1:16:59] taken a
[1:17:00] wife and find some uncleanness in her
[1:17:06] right now I've proved it to you right
[1:17:08] here before and we'll get back into it
[1:17:09] later and prove it we don't have
[1:17:12] time that doesn't mean they had to have
[1:17:18] intercourse the very word that the
[1:17:20] definition comes from tells you that
[1:17:24] you find some uncleanness in her and
[1:17:26] sure ain't she didn't take a
[1:17:31] bath little
[1:17:33] girls young girls don't let these men
[1:17:36] touch you
[1:17:38] right if you volunteer to let them touch
[1:17:40] you you're
[1:17:43] unclean give them a good wrap across the
[1:17:47] face amen well he might hurt me will
[1:17:49] he's hurting you
[1:17:51] anyway right they don't have nothing to
[1:17:54] do with him no
[1:17:55] more
[1:17:57] amen a boy won't respect a girl's
[1:18:00] privacy of her life you don't need to be
[1:18:03] going with him I don't care what his
[1:18:05] brother ROM said about that girl said he
[1:18:07] smells so good and got pretty
[1:18:14] feet that's right a lot of things could
[1:18:17] have been solved if we have just tried
[1:18:18] to been right amen right that's
[1:18:21] right and if you really correct a boy
[1:18:24] and him a decent boy he's going to line
[1:18:28] up that's
[1:18:30] right if he's a good decent boy
[1:18:33] especially if his mom and dadd has
[1:18:34] taught him
[1:18:41] right see we've taught our kids from the
[1:18:44] time this church started right here cuz
[1:18:45] I didn't know it before
[1:18:47] then don't you ask a girl to marry
[1:18:50] you till you get ready to marry
[1:18:55] cuz if she accepts you're married right
[1:18:58] and you don't come back later and say
[1:19:00] well Daddy I didn't want to marry that
[1:19:03] one daddy stand here and says you're
[1:19:05] married
[1:19:08] right you're going to live with it
[1:19:13] right what you see it's just marriage
[1:19:15] and divorce it's just just divorce for
[1:19:17] anything you just we just we just don't
[1:19:19] want to live together we just get a
[1:19:21] divorce there is no word
[1:19:24] divorce in true Christianity no sir amen
[1:19:28] there is no word divorce for a
[1:19:33] woman that's exactly right that's pure B
[1:19:37] right now you show it to me in the Bible
[1:19:39] if you
[1:19:40] can we live in a day when modern
[1:19:43] terminologies is so messed up everything
[1:19:45] until maybe sometimes you may have to
[1:19:47] get a separation from your husband to
[1:19:49] get you to P child support or something
[1:19:51] like that you you may even be forced to
[1:19:53] go down and apply for a formal
[1:19:56] separation but there's no word divorce
[1:19:59] that's
[1:20:05] right you said but that just makes it so
[1:20:09] hard my mom had a good way of
[1:20:13] saying you said it to yours I'm sure she
[1:20:16] said you make your bed hard you'll sleep
[1:20:19] in
[1:20:20] it that's right amen
[1:20:24] right that was good
[1:20:27] terminology we ain't got nobody to blame
[1:20:29] but
[1:20:32] ourselves with the situation we're
[1:20:35] in but thank God there is a Grace of
[1:20:39] marriage and
[1:20:40] divorce
[1:20:44] right thank God there is a Grace of
[1:20:46] marriage and divorce right that can set
[1:20:49] us free because it's what I said in a
[1:20:51] while ago I don't see how that see a man
[1:20:54] and two or three wives is not a type of
[1:20:56] Christian church right if a man's got
[1:20:59] two or three wives he he can't be typing
[1:21:01] Christ in the church if if the woman got
[1:21:03] to her three husband she can't be typing
[1:21:04] Christ in the church and I thought it
[1:21:06] was Christ in the church it was going in
[1:21:08] the Rapture right and I told you you can
[1:21:11] go by the
[1:21:12] grave why do you think marriage and
[1:21:14] divorce had to be preached right sure
[1:21:19] absolutely if we didn't need it as a
[1:21:22] brother here one time trying to preach
[1:21:23] you he said when you got born
[1:21:27] again he said that took care of all your
[1:21:29] amical problems I got to run up here and
[1:21:31] sit that ain't
[1:21:33] right well if it is why the prophet
[1:21:36] preach married and divorce he just
[1:21:37] preached a new
[1:21:44] birth nobody looks down on nobody
[1:21:48] else that's right because after we
[1:21:50] finished all of the Natural Life then
[1:21:53] we're just capable of stepping up to the
[1:21:55] point of understanding what Paul said it
[1:21:57] he espoused
[1:22:00] us Y and how that he could say that some
[1:22:03] of you were this and that the other but
[1:22:06] he said now you're clean
[1:22:10] am speaking of a time that they would
[1:22:13] come that we could be totally clean Body
[1:22:15] Spirit Soul amen that's right there
[1:22:19] could have never been a change of the
[1:22:20] body this is what I believe what do you
[1:22:22] believe it or not I don't believe it
[1:22:23] ever could been a change of the body
[1:22:25] without the grace of marriage and
[1:22:26] divorce that's
[1:22:34] right right but then see we were all
[1:22:37] married to
[1:22:39] Satan he was our nearest of kin in the
[1:22:42] Book of Ruth sir amen
[1:22:47] right he said well brother D you just
[1:22:49] don't believe what the new birth can
[1:22:51] do
[1:22:54] I'm
[1:22:56] sorry I'm just
[1:23:00] playing if the new birth could take away
[1:23:02] of all our marital problems all why did
[1:23:04] the prophet have to preach it why did
[1:23:07] Paul have to preach it right why did
[1:23:09] Moses have to preach it
[1:23:14] right I was thinking the other day you
[1:23:16] know that Moses when we get around to it
[1:23:19] Jesus said because of the hardness of
[1:23:20] your heart in other words you wanted it
[1:23:22] Moses didn't tell you you could do it
[1:23:24] for everything he said you wanted
[1:23:28] it but see brother brandham didn't come
[1:23:30] along to tell us everything was okay he
[1:23:32] come along to tell us what wasn't okay
[1:23:34] right that's it and what we needed to
[1:23:36] get right amen and if we don't get it
[1:23:39] right we're going by the
[1:23:42] grave I'm not de christianizing anybody
[1:23:45] to say they're not
[1:23:46] Christians never
[1:23:48] have but why wouldn't a true Christian
[1:23:51] want their life straight right
[1:23:55] right but see are we like the lady that
[1:23:57] said if I tell my husband he'll divorce
[1:23:59] me he said Jo done last year
[1:24:01] y so which one do you want the husband
[1:24:04] or
[1:24:10] God come on church this thing goes into
[1:24:13] a spiritual condition that's right that
[1:24:15] you and I were married to organize
[1:24:17] religion right by our
[1:24:20] vows amen we made
[1:24:27] Y and if he don't disallow those
[1:24:30] vows we're going to face
[1:24:34] them we can holler New Birth all we want
[1:24:37] to we better be concerned with marriage
[1:24:40] and divorce right but do you understand
[1:24:44] what I'm saying now to get this part out
[1:24:45] of the way an engagement a spouse betro
[1:24:51] vows makes a
[1:24:53] wedding and the other things take place
[1:24:56] because of the wedding right and
[1:24:58] consummates or what you call completes
[1:25:00] the wedding brings it more into greater
[1:25:04] things that's
[1:25:07] right but you married by your word
[1:25:11] amen that's it so kids just don't go
[1:25:13] playing with the
[1:25:14] word amen that's
[1:25:18] right and For Heaven's Sake you better
[1:25:20] tell that boy or that girl that you
[1:25:22] going to married one day you better tell
[1:25:24] them the truth about your life yes sir
[1:25:27] amen
[1:25:31] amen most people only preach to the
[1:25:34] woman all preaches to the man and the
[1:25:37] woman both of them are virgins right
[1:25:41] read to
[1:25:43] Corinthians he speaks of the man's
[1:25:45] virginity as well as the woman's
[1:25:46] virginity right
[1:25:50] amen m
[1:25:53] let's Stand Together come
[1:25:57] on just don't make your committ but if
[1:26:00] you make them just be honest enough to
[1:26:01] stand up say
[1:26:06] done
[1:26:09] am brother randoms even told us how to
[1:26:11] solve marital
[1:26:14] problems there something that you doubt
[1:26:16] have a problem he said and you know what
