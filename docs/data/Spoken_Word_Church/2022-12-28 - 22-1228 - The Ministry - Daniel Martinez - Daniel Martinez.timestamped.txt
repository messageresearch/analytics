[22:28] I'll ask you to stand in just a little
[22:30] bit I was just wanting to you know just
[22:33] say that uh we have never experienced
[22:36] the kind of cold that came this time
[22:38] here in Georgia I mean New Mexico gets
[22:42] cold yeah it's cold over there but uh
[22:45] not not like this this is Wet This is a
[22:48] wet cold it just goes right through your
[22:49] clothes never seen it like that I've
[22:52] heard of it but never seen it uh and uh
[22:56] it was painful I mean I've never seen it
[22:59] where you walk out in the in the in the
[23:01] weather like that and your face just
[23:03] feels like it stings
[23:04] but uh we got through Christmas it was
[23:08] great uh all the grandkids Josiah Olivia
[23:11] yeah uh uh Jonas Sophia it's great to
[23:16] see them again I enjoyed their having
[23:19] them and and being around them and
[23:22] uh playing with them somewhat Mordecai
[23:25] and Isaiah they're they're great little
[23:27] kids and I have a good time with them
[23:29] and of course my my own children too
[23:32] they're they're not put aside but we had
[23:35] a great Christmas uh
[23:37] Joseph asked me to uh to do a little
[23:40] Christmas sermon uh because Sunday came
[23:43] around and it was Christmas day so uh I
[23:47] I did start off trying to preach there
[23:50] uh wasn't I don't know if it was
[23:52] successful or not you'd have to ask them
[23:54] but uh but I talked a little bit about
[23:57] uh about John the Baptist and I want to
[24:00] talk a little bit about the ministry
[24:02] this I want to I want to talk a little
[24:04] bit about the ministry and uh and so
[24:07] let's uh let's stand up and go before
[24:10] the Lord and as we read his word
[24:14] amen I want to turn to Isaiah
[24:18] the
[24:20] 40th verse 40 and 3.
[24:26] and bear with me because I use markers
[24:30] to get to where I need to be
[24:32] Isaiah
[24:34] 40. the third verse
[24:37] it says
[24:39] the voice of him that crieth in the
[24:42] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[24:45] Lord make straight in the desert a
[24:49] highway for our God
[24:51] amen you can be seated I got a lot of
[24:54] scripture so I'll be going through a few
[24:56] scriptures but this scripture here is
[25:00] Isaiah hundreds of years before John the
[25:03] Baptist was even born
[25:05] and the scripture says that John the
[25:07] Baptist even received the Holy Ghost
[25:09] while he was yet in his mother's womb
[25:11] not too many of us get that opportunity
[25:14] but uh he actually received the Holy
[25:17] Ghost while healing his mother's womb
[25:19] you can read that in Acts uh I think
[25:22] it's acts 1 and an interesting thing I
[25:25] was reading uh I was reading about John
[25:28] the Baptist in a way where John the
[25:31] Baptist was was told his whole Ministry
[25:36] was described by an Angel of the Lord to
[25:39] Zechariah
[25:40] and uh as he just as he was described to
[25:44] uh Elizabeth I mean to Zechariah the
[25:47] angel explained some details about his
[25:50] ministry and I'd like to talk a little
[25:52] bit about some of the things that were
[25:54] said so let's go over to uh Saint Luke 1
[25:57] verse 11.
[26:01] and uh
[26:03] let's go over there real quick
[26:06] this one I don't seem to have marked so
[26:08] bear with me
[26:10] say Luke 1 verse 11.
[26:25] Saint Luke 1 verse 11 and this is the
[26:29] Angel the angel speaking to Zechariah
[26:32] um
[26:35] okay
[26:37] and there appeared unto him an angel of
[26:41] the Lord standing on the right side of
[26:44] the altar of incense
[26:47] um you know I was uh
[26:49] the Christians or should I say in the
[26:52] Old Testament they used to burn incense
[26:55] and incense stood for what you know
[26:59] the prayers of the people it represented
[27:02] the prayers of the people so zechariah's
[27:05] turn came about and he was going to
[27:06] offer incense and okay uh let me go on
[27:11] reading angels are standing at the right
[27:13] hand side of the altar of incense and
[27:15] when Zechariah saw him
[27:19] he was troubled and fear Came Upon him
[27:21] but the angel said unto him fear not
[27:24] Zacharias for thy prayers have been
[27:27] heard and the and thy wife Elizabeth
[27:29] shall bear a son in his and he shall he
[27:34] shall be called and
[27:36] and thou shalt call his name John and
[27:39] thou shalt have joy and gladness and
[27:43] many shall rejoice at his birth for he
[27:47] shall be great in the sight of the Lord
[27:50] and shall drink neither strong wine nor
[27:53] strong drink where does this come up we
[27:55] understand that the angel Lords also
[27:58] spoke to to brother Brown and said
[28:00] you're not don't drink a strong drink
[28:03] okay uh
[28:05] and and when and
[28:09] and he's he he's he shall be filled with
[28:14] the Holy Ghost even from his mother's
[28:16] womb and
[28:18] many of the children of Israel shall he
[28:22] turned to the Lord their God and
[28:25] he shall go before him in the spirit in
[28:31] power of Elijah
[28:33] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[28:37] children and the disobedient to the
[28:40] wisdom of the just notice he didn't say
[28:44] turn the hearts of the
[28:48] fathers
[28:49] to the children
[28:51] now if we go back to Malachi 4 we find
[28:54] out that the scripture of the coming of
[28:56] Elijah in Malachi forces he'll turn the
[28:59] hearts of the fathers to the children
[29:03] at the end of the verse but it doesn't
[29:06] say but here the Angels saying he's
[29:08] going to turn the hearts of the
[29:11] fathers to the children
[29:14] okay but it doesn't say the children
[29:17] back to the fathers the children back to
[29:20] the fathers was a reference given in
[29:23] Malachi 4 that brother Branham explained
[29:25] and we understand through the message
[29:27] that it's the message of this hour that
[29:30] brings us to that
[29:32] brings us to that so it's it's almost a
[29:34] a division of a whole uh Ministry the
[29:39] ministry of John the Baptist is
[29:40] different from the ministry of William
[29:42] Branham or should I say the prophet of
[29:44] this hour
[29:45] so let's take a look so we see he
[29:48] stopped there now we go over to uh uh
[29:51] Jesus when he was uh saying the spirit
[29:54] of the Lord is upon me and I uh
[29:57] he was he was quoting reading out of the
[30:00] book of Isaiah Isaiah 60 and 1. and
[30:04] let's go over there Isaiah 60 and 1.
[30:07] this is uh of course the scripture we're
[30:10] referring to as Saint Luke 4 18.
[30:13] Jesus is reading let's go to there first
[30:16] saint Luke 4 18.
[30:19] Hallelujah
[30:21] Saint Luke 4 18.
[30:25] be praying for me I'm a little rusty
[30:27] don't wonder if I'm going to get this
[30:30] point across 4 18.
[30:33] okay
[30:37] well let's just go 4 17. and uh 417 and
[30:42] there was
[30:44] and there was delivered unto him they're
[30:47] giving him the book The Book of the
[30:49] Prophet is Isaiah and when he had opened
[30:53] the book he found the place where it was
[30:56] written
[30:57] and Jesus speaking here it's in red the
[31:00] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[31:03] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[31:06] the poor he hath sent me to heal the
[31:10] brokenhearted to preach the delivery
[31:14] Deliverance to the captives the recovery
[31:17] of sight to the blind to sit at Liberty
[31:20] them that are bruised to preach the
[31:23] acceptable ear of the Lord and he
[31:25] stopped
[31:27] now if you go back to Isaiah where he
[31:30] Isaiah 60 let's go over there real quick
[31:34] Isaiah 60
[31:37] is
[31:41] purple one
[31:45] Isaiah 60 where he's where Jesus is
[31:48] quoting from this scripture
[31:50] Isaiah 60 he reads the very same thing
[31:54] and when you get to the second verse to
[31:57] proclaim the acceptable ear
[32:01] of the Lord and he stops and he didn't
[32:04] say and the day of Vengeance of our God
[32:09] now if you jump across the page or down
[32:12] down a little ways you'll find out on 63
[32:16] verse 63 of I mean chapter 63 of that
[32:19] same of the book of Isaiah you'll find
[32:22] out it says the day of Vengeance on the
[32:26] footnotes on the top it says the day of
[32:28] Vengeance but then on the third verse of
[32:31] of chapter 63 it says
[32:36] this this is actually talking about
[32:38] Judgment Day it says I have troddened
[32:41] down the wine press
[32:43] wine press alone and I have and and of
[32:48] the people there was none
[32:50] with me and I I will tread them down in
[32:55] mine anger
[32:57] and
[32:58] trampled them
[33:00] in my Fury
[33:02] and their blood shall be sprinkled upon
[33:07] the my
[33:09] garments and I will stained all my
[33:13] Remnant Raymond Raymond so you see if
[33:17] you're looking at at him stopping there
[33:21] it was his ministry
[33:23] he wasn't going he wasn't here to preach
[33:26] the great Judgment Day
[33:28] now if you go to Malachi Malachi
[33:32] for
[33:33] you drop over to Malachi 4 it's telling
[33:36] you of a judgment day let's drop over to
[33:38] Malachi 4.
[33:43] bear with me here
[33:46] Malachi fourth chapter
[33:48] it says
[33:52] you start on the fourth chapter at the
[33:54] beginning of the fourth chapter it says
[33:56] behold the day cometh that shall burn as
[34:01] an oven that's the great Judgment Day
[34:03] that shall burn as an oven and the proud
[34:06] yea and all they that do wickedly shall
[34:09] be stubble and the day that cometh shall
[34:14] burn them up
[34:15] the day of judgment
[34:17] so Malachi 4 is talking about the day of
[34:20] judgment about the end time
[34:23] but you go over to Malachi 4 5 Verse 6
[34:27] and it tells you that there's a Ministry
[34:31] for John the Baptist turning the hearts
[34:33] of the children I mean the of the
[34:38] fathers to the children
[34:41] turning the hearts of the
[34:45] fathers to the children John the Baptist
[34:48] but then there's a comma there and then
[34:51] the word and the hearts of the children
[34:54] to the fathers
[34:56] we know that's the ministry that came in
[34:59] our last day before the great and
[35:01] judgment great day of judgment and
[35:04] notice some of the aspects about that
[35:07] Ministry was back in verse
[35:11] about that Ministry
[35:14] is in in chapter 4 verse 2 but unto but
[35:19] unto you that fear my name
[35:22] shall the son of righteousness arise
[35:24] with healing in his wings
[35:27] so it's saying a Healing Ministry before
[35:30] the great judgment
[35:32] will be coming forth and we understand
[35:35] that that's what we're standing in we're
[35:37] recognizing that the message of this
[35:39] hour is showing us that they're going to
[35:43] be a Ministry of in Elijah to come that
[35:47] would bring a Healing Ministry amen so
[35:50] we start to see that God doesn't make
[35:53] any mistakes he doesn't put a period or
[35:56] a pause or a stop he doesn't stop for
[35:59] some reason it's for a reason that he
[36:01] stopped because there was a reason it
[36:04] was going to come in another time
[36:06] see when he when he he was going to come
[36:08] as the judge of of of the living and the
[36:12] dead in the great judgment day but it
[36:15] wasn't for the ministry he was
[36:16] presenting at that time
[36:19] he came to save the world he came to
[36:22] give his life for the world he came to
[36:25] pay the price he didn't come to bring
[36:27] judgment to the world at that time
[36:31] and there's where we all come in we all
[36:34] come in under that grace period and that
[36:37] grace period is what we can reach out to
[36:39] and hold on to we see that the ministry
[36:42] and that's what I want to speak about is
[36:44] the ministry we understand that a
[36:46] minister uh when you when you talk about
[36:49] Ministry Ministry isn't because they a
[36:51] person gets up here wanting to be served
[36:54] actually a minister is a servant to the
[36:58] people he's here to give his give to
[37:01] yield himself to yield himself to the
[37:04] spirit of God to be able to uh study and
[37:07] give his life and read and and and and
[37:09] and and and ask God to give him the
[37:12] understanding he said he can minister to
[37:14] the people he's more like a servant or a
[37:16] Slave
[37:17] or you could say Jesus called him to the
[37:20] 11th Hour workers
[37:22] they're workers so the ministry stands
[37:26] here as servants to the people to
[37:28] minister to the people not to be Jesus
[37:31] said to his disciples he says what were
[37:33] you guys talking about well we're
[37:35] wondering who was the greatest
[37:38] and he says you know I my example to you
[37:42] is not to to be served but to serve you
[37:46] know the Gentiles or exercise lordship
[37:49] but I came to you to tell you that the
[37:52] one who's great amongst you is your
[37:54] servant
[37:55] he's came to tell you the Way Up Is Down
[37:59] you got to humble yourself to be
[38:02] anything great
[38:03] you got to yield yourself to the spirit
[38:05] of God to do anything that's meaningful
[38:09] the Way Up Is Down and you start to
[38:12] understand that this ministry the
[38:15] ministry of the of the disciples
[38:18] Peter I mean it took him to to to deny
[38:23] the Lord and and and and cry bitterly
[38:26] and then and give a real sincere
[38:28] repentance and come back and then he he
[38:32] felt he was leading nothing
[38:36] and being another thing he could say
[38:38] silver or gold I don't have but what I
[38:40] do have I'll give to you in the name of
[38:43] Jesus Christ rise to your feet see
[38:45] there's the difference
[38:48] it's not anything that a person can make
[38:50] of himself it's the person that'll yield
[38:53] himself to the spirit of God
[38:56] it that's what the ministry is all about
[38:59] and when we talk about Ministry I look
[39:01] at Lula Georgia
[39:02] I look at what your church has become
[39:05] remember that when we first came out we
[39:08] just came out because God sent a prophet
[39:11] and we saw the Miracles
[39:13] we saw the Miracles we saw the things
[39:15] that God was doing through the ministry
[39:17] and we said hey we got to get out of
[39:19] denomination
[39:21] we got away from denomination we got
[39:23] away from the the denominational ways
[39:26] and thinking and stuff but the advance
[39:29] to the ministry came in the humility
[39:33] in the humility of a people that has
[39:36] yielded to God that will raise up
[39:38] ministers and things that will say look
[39:40] I'm I'm nothing you're everything
[39:43] you know it's not a big me and a little
[39:46] you it's you it's you before God
[39:49] and it's come to the place where Lula
[39:52] Georgia is is doing a great job in
[39:55] serving the lord I listened to it on the
[39:56] on the broadcast and and I said man I
[40:00] says I wish I could preach like you guys
[40:02] you know I wish I could say the things
[40:04] you guys say I mean I I do take notes
[40:07] and I says if someday I'm going to copy
[40:11] what brother Bob is saying because
[40:12] someday I'm going to preach something
[40:14] like I'm going to mention some of the
[40:16] things he said I'm going to preach what
[40:17] brother Wade's saying because there's
[40:19] someday I'm going to say some of the
[40:21] things he says
[40:22] all the ministers your brother Aaron
[40:24] Brother you were a great preacher
[40:27] oh yeah you know I can see the and and
[40:30] the songs my goodness they raised me up
[40:33] and you say well uh uh you don't realize
[40:37] the impact it has Across the Nation
[40:39] everybody listens to you it's a blessing
[40:43] and you start to see that the the
[40:45] history
[40:47] of Lula Georgia it's making an impact to
[40:50] a bride around the world
[40:53] so till you stand to stand firm hold to
[40:57] God's unchanging hands you're living for
[40:59] God and it's the ministry is producing
[41:02] something and I'm I'm your one happy
[41:05] family and I realize that you know what
[41:08] you know I realize that you know when I
[41:10] stand back I says that's a place I'd you
[41:13] know at least there's no gossip there
[41:15] you know there's there's nobody saying
[41:18] anything about each other they're
[41:20] they're holy to God they're praying for
[41:22] each other you know so I start to look
[41:24] and I start to look at at Christianity
[41:27] as a whole and I look at the I look at
[41:29] the things that that that are going on
[41:32] you know
[41:33] I was looking at the history of of uh
[41:37] the seven Church ages
[41:40] now I'm talking about history like what
[41:42] the internet explains they they got
[41:44] people that are standing right there in
[41:46] Corinth at the ruins of Corinth and
[41:49] they're telling you what was going on at
[41:51] the time right after the book of Acts
[41:53] after Paul had already preached to them
[41:55] and brought out a Ministry and
[41:56] everything and what they went through
[41:58] and how it typed out to the Book of
[42:00] Revelations the seven Church ages and I
[42:04] started looking at them and I says you
[42:06] know what it must have been very hard
[42:08] you say Pagan is like oh we're not going
[42:10] to worship idols why are they have a
[42:13] problem with that worshiping idle to
[42:14] stuff like that
[42:16] but you know Christians don't have to
[42:17] worry about those things but think about
[42:20] it
[42:21] if a Christian in those days
[42:23] would would would would and and this
[42:27] this is some people went to death went
[42:29] to the they they actually wrote
[42:32] how they had to give their lives they
[42:34] they wrote their last Testament
[42:36] give you their lives because they
[42:38] wouldn't take that little handful of
[42:40] incense and drop it in a little pot of
[42:44] Fire
[42:46] in honor of the of the Caesar
[42:49] Caesar was called to God in honor of the
[42:52] Caesar because
[42:53] everybody who went into the marketplace
[42:56] had to throw that incense in
[43:01] and incense represented the prayers of
[43:03] the Saints and if you're going to drop
[43:05] that instance in what's God going to
[43:07] look at you like
[43:09] but they'd rather not go into the
[43:12] marketplace
[43:13] they'd rather get criticized they'd
[43:15] close their they'd close their business
[43:16] down
[43:18] if they didn't follow their Pagan ways
[43:22] and Christians gave their life for that
[43:25] Christians gave their lives to to to to
[43:28] not take part in that stuff
[43:32] and how many times would we we you know
[43:35] you stand there and you say well I'm
[43:37] gonna watch my television said I'm going
[43:39] to do this I'm gonna I'm gonna and it's
[43:42] not that I don't watch TV I was that's
[43:44] that actually I got that on YouTube okay
[43:46] but it's not that but but you realize
[43:50] that hey you don't have to watch the
[43:52] murders
[43:54] okay you don't have to watch the the the
[43:57] the investigations and the the things
[43:59] that are out there you don't have to
[44:01] watch the filth you don't have to watch
[44:02] the filthy commercials you don't have to
[44:04] watch all those things there's a there's
[44:07] a an anointing on you there there's a
[44:09] you you feel that that condemnation or
[44:12] the or the the the conscience in you
[44:16] that drives you to a higher colleague
[44:20] a higher calling in Christ you spend
[44:22] your time more in prayer
[44:25] asking God to please help so and so
[44:28] she's going through some pain please
[44:30] help so and so please raise them up give
[44:32] them bring them out of cancer bring them
[44:34] out of
[44:38] what they're dealing with because we
[44:41] recognize we we have that love joy peace
[44:45] love for each other
[44:46] amen so that that history of you know
[44:50] what it wasn't easy for those ones in
[44:52] the book of Acts
[44:53] it wasn't easy for Paul it wasn't easy
[44:57] for the brother in there that in the in
[44:59] the in the gospel they gave their lives
[45:01] for it how much more are we as
[45:04] Christians in our day because we're
[45:06] being witnessed you say I'm a witness
[45:09] I I wasn't there through brother Brown's
[45:12] campaigns I'm not a witness of those
[45:14] things yes you are
[45:15] as you read and you see the scriptures
[45:18] and you see the how the Bible ties
[45:21] together how the word comes to pass how
[45:23] the words producing how the faith that
[45:26] you guys have can bring you know if
[45:29] anybody's praying I know I I'm only
[45:31] saying Lord have Lula Georgia pray for
[45:35] my wife she's at the point of death
[45:37] and they did
[45:39] so you see there's the thing when when
[45:41] people call out to God and ask God God
[45:44] will step in the scene
[45:47] and I'm so grateful for those miracles
[45:49] for those prayers
[45:51] you know I know it wasn't easy for them
[45:53] for the people the Disciples of that day
[45:56] I know they gave their lives several of
[45:58] them were executed and and and and and
[46:01] and the Book of Martyrs started off in
[46:03] the book of Acts
[46:05] I know that happened
[46:07] but we stand in a day when this ministry
[46:11] is coming to a climax
[46:14] it's coming to A A place where they'll
[46:17] they'll they'll take their stand
[46:19] for this gospel that's been preached
[46:22] this word this this the the they they're
[46:25] they're uh there's a time you know
[46:29] when we look at
[46:31] where our part is in the in the
[46:34] scriptures
[46:35] when we look at our ministry
[46:37] you say well Lula I'm looking at
[46:39] Espanola where we go to church
[46:42] I'm looking at what brother Manuel's
[46:44] preaching and and things and I recognize
[46:46] that
[46:48] as he's preaching he's talking to talk
[46:50] about like the things that people shun
[46:53] at
[46:55] and they say well or or they get
[46:58] surprised or they'll say oh you can't
[47:00] say that you can't say I and the father
[47:03] are one
[47:04] you can't say uh uh uh Christ in me the
[47:08] hope of glory you can't say that you've
[47:11] got Jesus in you so well that you're
[47:14] perfect
[47:17] you know
[47:19] there is a people the scripture says be
[47:22] perfect as your father in Heaven is
[47:24] perfect so you start to start to look at
[47:26] hey the end result of a Christian that
[47:29] met that that loves the Lord is going to
[47:32] become that his nature
[47:35] changes there in second Peter or yeah uh
[47:39] second Peter the first chapter it says
[47:42] be partakers of the divine nature
[47:46] there's only one divine nature being
[47:49] partakers of the Holy Ghost is being
[47:51] partakers of that divine nature and if
[47:54] you're going to be partakers of the
[47:56] divine nature you're going to have the
[47:59] nature of Christ in you
[48:01] and the nature of Christ in you isn't to
[48:03] say I'm holy holier than thou is to say
[48:08] through humility God has made me
[48:12] the Christian I ought to be
[48:15] God has made me the the living example
[48:20] to a world around me
[48:22] how do you become a living example to
[48:24] the world around you it's by the
[48:27] anointing of the Holy Spirit on your
[48:29] life
[48:30] amen
[48:32] amen we stay we stand here we look at
[48:35] Miracles we look at the things God's
[48:37] done we look at the ministry that this
[48:40] message has produced for us and we say
[48:43] well we know that there's got to be a
[48:45] falling away scripture says there is
[48:48] this Falling Away has happened already
[48:51] but it all depends if you're going to
[48:54] stay the ground or stay your way you
[48:57] know the the uh the
[49:02] the disciples
[49:04] the children of God the minister the
[49:07] people of God always stood their ground
[49:12] they stood their ground to say I believe
[49:14] in Jesus Christ no matter what the apop
[49:18] position wants to say what happens here
[49:21] they come they say oh you're going to
[49:22] believe in that Jesus Christ has said
[49:24] that you're going to have to eat his
[49:27] flesh and drink his blood that's
[49:28] cannibalism that's vampires what are you
[49:31] gonna do
[49:33] you say you know what
[49:35] some of them said I don't know why he
[49:38] said that
[49:39] I don't know why he said that I don't
[49:41] know what reason that he said that
[49:44] but he's right
[49:47] I don't know why that I can't explain
[49:50] the reasons that they go after the cloud
[49:55] but what brother Brown said the cloud
[49:57] was is good enough for me
[50:00] you know I don't have to go explain the
[50:02] Hulk it can't be a rocket or how it go
[50:05] how it's something else or what it is or
[50:07] all this I just stand there and say look
[50:09] the way the prophet of God explained it
[50:12] is good enough for me because you know
[50:15] what
[50:16] I don't see any of these critics
[50:19] opening some Blind Man's eyes I don't
[50:22] see any of these critics asking asking
[50:25] the Lord to or or praying over somebody
[50:27] and Cancer's getting well or or dead
[50:29] people coming to life I don't see any of
[50:31] those critics doing that
[50:35] I see the word of God being manifested
[50:37] through a vessel
[50:39] that's yielded to him and if I can
[50:42] become that same kind of vessel and I
[50:45] yield myself to him I'll start producing
[50:49] the very same thing
[50:51] amen the holy spirit in my life can
[50:54] produce the same things
[50:55] amen because it's why because it's a
[50:57] promise I've seen it throughout the
[50:59] whole word there's a promise of God for
[51:01] these for the manifestation of the sons
[51:04] of God and they're going to get stronger
[51:06] and stronger and stronger as we move
[51:09] into the last days amen
[51:12] and you can see this whole world's
[51:14] falling apart
[51:16] the world's falling apart I can go
[51:19] through and tell you about the things I
[51:21] see in in the that brother Brown had
[51:24] explained that are now coming to pass
[51:25] yeah I can tell you the events to me
[51:29] that are made clear by the prophecies
[51:31] yes I can tell you these things
[51:33] but you all are reading those things
[51:36] you know those things but what we're
[51:38] starting to see is that the
[51:41] manifestation of the sons of God
[51:45] it comes from a people a Praying people
[51:48] of faithful people a people that will
[51:51] seek God for every aspect of their lives
[51:56] they'll seek God for their brother
[51:58] they'll feel for their brother they'll
[52:01] feel for their sister when they're going
[52:03] through a trial you're going through a
[52:05] trial
[52:06] amen that it's it becomes a place where
[52:09] you you you you you call out to God for
[52:12] the for the for a for your brother your
[52:15] sister and it starts to produce and you
[52:19] uh a Ministry amen a Ministry that will
[52:24] manifest Jesus Christ amen as we look at
[52:27] the at the at the
[52:30] the power of God that's been manifested
[52:32] through the pillar of fire we notice
[52:36] what Ministry
[52:38] can say clearly
[52:40] the pillar fires back again
[52:43] you say well brother Daniel I haven't
[52:46] seen it
[52:47] in your day I haven't seen
[52:50] brother I don't have to see it to know
[52:52] it's there
[52:54] amen but yet yet
[52:57] beyond that point
[52:59] what are you going to do when it appears
[53:01] here
[53:03] are we looking for the sign or are we
[53:05] looking for the word
[53:07] the word says it's there the word shows
[53:11] you it's there the words manifesting
[53:13] that it's there and and when he when he
[53:17] comes back and raises the dead or heals
[53:19] the sick or or produces what the what
[53:21] the apostles have seen in the book of
[53:23] Acts you start to say look I recognize
[53:28] that through the manifestation of the
[53:31] word of God in my day it's become just
[53:35] a nature to you the nature of God in
[53:38] your life
[53:39] amen I can see that God's moving and as
[53:43] God's moving I can also see that hey
[53:46] the the the time is culminating or come
[53:50] it's coming to an end
[53:52] because I can see the cars that they're
[53:55] now working on there are going to drive
[53:58] themselves well they say well the Tesla
[53:59] didn't work it's just not doing that
[54:01] great
[54:02] but it's not stopping all the rest of
[54:04] the car companies for approaching
[54:06] looking for that it's not uh stopping
[54:09] the the it's not stopping our economy
[54:11] from taking its bust you know Rome's got
[54:14] to buy it out one day
[54:16] let me tell you your your your your your
[54:18] your the money you've been putting away
[54:20] into your retirement it's not what it
[54:22] used to be
[54:23] because because there's going to come a
[54:26] time when call Rome has to call back all
[54:30] the bonds
[54:33] and I can see Russia being threatened
[54:36] over there at the Ukraine
[54:38] and threatening he turns around Russia
[54:41] Russia turns around and says uh you
[54:43] bring in
[54:45] aircrafts into this war you bring in air
[54:48] for air support into this war and we're
[54:50] nuking the whole world
[54:52] a threat and everybody backed off oh
[54:55] he's going to Nuke the whole world
[54:58] but I mean we we know that the scripture
[55:03] says that the flesh will fall off their
[55:05] faces while they're still alive and the
[55:07] birds will come and eat them I mean we
[55:10] know that the what nukes gonna do
[55:13] you know but we recognize also the bride
[55:16] isn't going to take any part of that
[55:18] promise is that there won't be one nuke
[55:21] used in in war before the brides often
[55:25] gone
[55:26] so we're looking at promises that the
[55:30] god that God has promised his people so
[55:33] we look at at trying to well we look at
[55:36] our lives lining up is your life worthy
[55:40] of this gospel
[55:42] the Bible says is you're life worthy of
[55:44] the Gospel
[55:46] so we start stand back and we start to
[55:48] look at our lives do am I doing the
[55:50] right thing am I doing what God asked me
[55:52] to do am I praying the time am I putting
[55:55] my time am I praying am I asking God to
[55:58] manifest himself in my life am I asking
[56:00] God to to show himself am I asking God
[56:03] to manifest himself in my life so that I
[56:05] can be there
[56:08] at the time I'm needed
[56:11] amen
[56:13] amen so as we stand let's start to look
[56:17] at the
[56:18] at the things that God's doing in our in
[56:21] our day
[56:23] communion you know some of the things
[56:26] that God has done let's go ahead and
[56:28] stand and we'll uh start to get ready to
[56:30] close
[56:33] you know communion
[56:36] we stand here and we look at
[56:38] there's been a lot of things
[56:41] just like in Zechariah
[56:43] an angel of the Lord has appeared in our
[56:46] day
[56:47] the pillar of fire has appeared in our
[56:49] day
[56:50] we have the truth about communion with
[56:52] unleavened bread and and actually using
[56:56] wine instead of grape juice the way the
[56:58] denominations want to push it
[57:00] we have the truth about uh about
[57:02] Holiness you know when we when when we
[57:05] look at the whole world falling after
[57:07] after what it what it goes for in in
[57:10] dress and clothing and we look at this
[57:12] true Spirit of Holiness by the spirit of
[57:15] God that's been produced by the book of
[57:16] Acts
[57:18] or or in the gospels in the scriptures
[57:21] we look at the uh at the Holy Ghost we
[57:23] look at the truth about the godhead it's
[57:25] been given to us we look at the Seven
[57:27] Seals and the Seven Church ages has been
[57:29] given to us in our day and age
[57:32] and we look at the manifestation of the
[57:34] holy ghost moving upon his people
[57:37] and we come to a place where we say oh
[57:40] Lord
[57:41] we need you Lord God we need you more
[57:44] than ever as this days are coming upon
[57:46] us
