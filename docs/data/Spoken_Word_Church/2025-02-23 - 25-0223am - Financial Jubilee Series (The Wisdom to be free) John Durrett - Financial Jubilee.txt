TRANSCRIPT
========================================
well God bless you all this morning hope everybody's awake praise the Lord amen well I am honored to be back in the seat this morning and um excited to share this this Sunday school lesson by the grace of the Lord Jubilee as you can see Financial is off of there so we're moving on Amen but I certainly hope Financial Jubilee has been a blessing to you all and um let's go a word of prayer as we get started precious Lord Jesus we just thank you Father we can gather in your name this morning Lord we just invite you father to come down and have control Lord bless your people Lord God just bless this Sunday school lesson Lord may it be encouraging Lord may it be real may it be able to be applied Lord in the practical ways in our life father Lord we appreciate you we thank you Lord just bless me Lord and allow me to get myself out of the way Lord and share this lesson we appreciate you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen amen well Financial Jubilee it continues to be a blessing to me as I said in my life uh applying it in my life and um of course encouraging my kids and challenging them as well and I've heard a lot of testimonies from the church a lot of testimonies of people paying off debts uh God blessing with inheritance and different things that allowed people to move move ahead and I thank the Lord for that I've heard of challenges heard of setbacks I heard of this about my last time so I have heard it all and um that's okay you know we're here to encourage one another you know but the financial Jubilee it's a pattern that's what it is it's a pattern for our freedom in all areas of our life you know and I stand Here by the grace of the Lord just uh finances I told you about my experience and God helped me but it's many other areas and we're going to talk about some of those areas that God is continuing to help me it's been his grace that has sustained me and I'm sure each one of you I think of the story of uh Peter walking on water and I heard someone actually giv a testimony about it and they said often when Peter walked on the water you hear two sides you hear about his initiative and taking that faith in him stepping out in the water and you also hear about him getting distracted and started to drown but sometime people don't mention that Jesus stepped forward and saved him kept him from drowning and that's the main thing if it wasn't for the grace of the Lord I know I would not have been able to make it I would have drowned in the circumstances of life but he he is the one that stepped in and kept me from drowning so it's his grace and I know it's the same for each and every one of you so Jubilee the wisdom to be free as we look at Jubilee and the the we hear things we know our prophets preach a message message here recognizing acting but I think all of that is what brings it together and we'll talk a little bit more about it because wisdom is about applying it absolutely applying what you hear in your life right so what when the trumpet sounded every man could go free if he wanted to go free that's why I love Jubilee because it is a trumpet is a sounding it's something it's telling us something we could go free if we want to go free amen why is it important to go free because as we're free we learn to manage these things in our life money is just an example if you've been faithful if therefore if you've not been faithful in the unrighteous man men who will commit to your trust the true riches he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much and that is about stewardship our whole journey of Freedom was about being stewards of what we've been given on this life's journey to manage it well so we can learn to manage more responsibilities and that's what God in his word word is about he's trying to bring us more responsibilities true riches that we can manage and this is a special time this is a special age where God has given us everything he's given us all of the knowledge that we need he's given us everything how the problem comes down to this practical side of it how are we going to use all that we've got we have to train we have to fight we have to learn how to apply all of this stuff that we're getting so when we're coming to the house of God and we're hearing we're going to hear knowledge we're going to hear words we're going to hear God's will but we have to walk out here and learn how to apply it and financial Jubilee again that's just a pattern that's showing us and I love it and special to me because again I I teach my children I try to hold them cuz I want them to see I want them to see the blessing in being a financial Steward and if they can see that pattern then I think it's the same pattern they can apply to every area of their life and I thank God for for my children they they have both my son and daughter that's a a small testimony on their side um they've worked hard they all have jobs and they've saved their money and they were able to buy a car without loans so I thank God for that [Applause] and that's what it's about it's about being practical I want them to see it I want them to experience so much for me I can say it but when they start seeing it then it makes all that difference and Anna she is A Savior by the way that girl can save some money my goodness she is a Savor dad put this in the put I'm like okay okay it's going to still be there but she saves really well and it starts out small she thinks well I'm not even making anything and but she keeps putting a little bit away and after a while it's like my goodness wow and she's seeing she's seeing for herself and that's the same thing we want with God's word all of these things that we're talking about in God's word we want it to be real for all ages I don't care how small you are because God is giving us something for all of us to apply it in our lives but we have to train we have to fight Financial Jubilee 10 and 11 you can certainly go back but that was talking about fighting and the fighting words and Joshua how God told Joshua you have to be brave you got to be courageous and that's what we need in this day this day in time we have to fight we got to be courageous we have to be brave all those things are necessary in this hour for us to be effective stewards God's part in all of this and as we get into wisdom you're going to see it's always about God's part and our part God is always faithful with his part he's always prepared he's always on time he's already got it covered it's our part that's the problem God's part here's this quote it says we are free from sin we are free from shackles we are free from Habits we are free from smoking drinking carousing because the Son of God has raised from the grave and has broke every Fetter all condemnation is gone the debt has been paid the penalty is paid the sins are washed away and we are free oh we are free people praise the Lord Jesus we are free amen that's in all areas of our life right we are free people that's what he has done he has broke every Fetter this is his truth this is what he's done he set us free praise the Lord amen but again it has to be real see I can say we're financially free but but are you are you free in your marriage are you free in your relationships are you free in your family situation are you truly free well that's the part and I think that's that's the it's a it's a very thin line I would say even as we preach and as people share the word and as you hear that our ears often will hear what God has done we hear his part him setting us free and we might even claim that there's nothing wrong with that but it's our part that we have to do to match it right and remember that's what he's coming in this day and time he's coming so that that bride would match him when he comes back so that's the whole thing that we're doing we're trying to get our part right he's given us all of the provisions he's given us everything that we need on this journey to reach it that's it God's part our part Prophet said and I'd say come on you got something to do too God just don't poke things down your neck you've got to believe it you've got to do some fighting that's what we have to do that is the hard part that's the hard part it is so hard that and I'm going to tell you that's why you have people who have walked away from the message because they hear God's part and they look at lives they look at their own lives and it's like well it's not matching up up so it gets confusing our kids get confused our families get confused because we have a great message that we're proclaiming we're totally free as you just read that quote before but our lives are not matching all the way right now we know by faith we know we're on a journey and we're going to get there by his grace but it should be something practical in our lives that people can see yes your kids can see our families can see your wife can see your husband can see that we're on a journey and that's the fight we have to fight our way through we have to do some fighting clean your lives up pay your debts oh no man Jesus said get all your things off your hands get everything right Make Ready Get Ready remember in the name of the Lord something is fixing to happen amen that is the Jubilee cry to me it's God has done his part now let's do our part let's clean up our lives let's get everything ready let's make ready let's get ourselves ready because something is fixing to happen amen this has been since the 65 this quote so every day everything we should be doing is putting things in place to make ourselves ready amen that's our part Make Ready Colossians 1 I I want you to focus on this quote because to me this says a whole lot and we're going to take our time and just read it through some of the verses Colossians one verse two it says to the Saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Kalise so he's speaking to Saints and faithful Brethren praise the Lord I can say that here in this this group Saints and faithful Brothers and Sisters in Christ that's who he's speaking to he said we give thanks to God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ praying always for you since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you have to All Saints my they got faith in Christ they have love for one another praise the Lord for the Hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof you heard before in the word word of truth of the Gospel which has come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it does also in you so they're bringing forth fruit praise the Lord since the day you heard of it and knew of the grace of God in truth praise God we see faith we see love we see fruits being produced in this church praise the Lord for this cause now this is where it's going okay let's take a step back for this cause since the day we heard of it do not cease to pray for you it almost seem like Paul would say y'all pray for me y'all got love Faith you got fruits pray for me Paul said no I'm praying for you I'm and I do not cease to pray for you and desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding he's saying you need something you need something practical here you need the knowledge of his will you need wisdom and you need spiritual understanding that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthen with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness praise the lord we need that we need that knowledge of his will we need his wisdom and we need spiritual understanding praise the Lord Jesus so that's what God is bringing out in this scripture of word letting us know we can have love we can be faithful we can have fruits but we need more and I truly believe that's what we need in this hour our part is to get it and apply it right as we look at knowledge wisdom and understanding knowledge is what God wants it's the facts and the information from God we have his word many people have his word we have the facts we have the information what does God want wisdom is applying what he wants applying what he wants I term it it's the skillful and the practice iCal application of God's will in your life right right that's a mouthful it's the skillful and practical application of God's will in your life yes sir that's what wisdom is about and understanding is why he wants it why does he want it all three of those go hand in hand it's a threefold chord that's powerful knowledge for example if I were to say the church is on fire now some of you can say well God thank you brother John God Bless you that's that's real wonderful I appreciate you sharing that message with me brother John that was wonderful so Lord the church is on fire well we appreciate that that was good you know I hear you well that's what we do when the knowledge of the word comes forth we're hearing a word we're hearing the truth in this day an hour but wisdom is what are you doing about it in the fire situation now some of you might say well where's the fire extinguisher some of you might say I'm getting up out of here some of you may say I'm going to call 911 okay so the wisdom is what is God's will for you with the word that he's giving to you how are you going to practically apply it in your life and then understand it so I'm getting out of here because I want to save my life I understand why I need to move or I need to help someone I want to make sure the kids are out I I want to make sure I'm understanding because I'm trying to save a life that's the understanding would be behind it and we want all of those things when it come down to the word but what I'm focusing on here is the wisdom side the applying what we're hearing applying it because God has a purpose in it see when I started applying Financial Jubilee I I didn't know in my own life that it was going to go so far far um as I could see the pattern and I could see the need as my father has gotten older and he's not the man that he can't work like how he used to and finances and many other things that I didn't even think about has been very necessary and I thank God that he helped me to be free in that area that I can be a better help to my family and help them on their journey and show that pattern to my kids and even share this Jubilee message because of what God did with this small thing so he's given me more understanding of it of the import ordance and that comes together to make it a very powerful pattern that we can apply in all the areas of our life amen so when we're dealing with wisdom it's applying what he wants it's the skillful practical application it's about the choices that we're going to make the Life Choices the actual application of it Proverbs 2:6 it says for the Lord gives wisdom from his mouth come knowledge and understanding it's the Lord that gives wisdom his mouth he comes knowledge and understanding he gives us all of these things wisdom again is the practical application so as we ask the Lord for wisdom he's going to give you experiences he's going to give you experiences so you can apply the knowledge that he's given he has no problem giving you that right the issue are we recognizing it that he's the one that's giving us given it to us okay so we can apply what we're learning amen amen some wisdom keys I'm going to share a couple wisdom Keys as we look at this word as we look at what God has delivered to us and again as you hear this what you want to look is the practical application wisdom key number one it says life is a love story that's what it is if you were go into the word and our message is telling us life is a love story it's God's part and his bride that's what it's all about about okay so you just think of a bride that's the part that we would play now God's part is to express himself Supply your needs now and for eternity that's God's part in this to express himself to express his desires to you so you know Lord this is what God is saying to us in his word this is what I want you to do this is how I want you to work through this situation this is how I want you to live okay and he came down we know he came down expressing himself through Jesus Christ in Colossians it actually says Jesus is the wisdom of God Jesus is the power and the wisdom so you can see how Jesus is the practical application of God right amen that's wisdom and he's expressing himself he's supplying all of our needs now and through eternity our part is to get ready Stay Ready keep the armor of God and fight to do life God's way give him the preeminence first place that's our part get ready Stay Ready many people start out but it's how we finish so we have to stay ready we have to keep the whole armor of God on and we have to fight to do life God's way he needs to have the preeminence first place in every area of our life amen wisdom key it's about you his will in your life seek out your own salvation it's his will in your life the church is on fire what part do you play get the kids get those who are elder get that door open get out get out of the way I hope it's not just a sit there so it's about you what's God will for me in my life this is very important especially and and I've I've experien this as our kids have gotten older and life challenges again the the tests and trials that God allows you to go through the experiences that he gives you so you can apply it practically I've learned to see that that wow I can't get caught up maybe in how my children are feeling how my wife's feeling I got to keep my own Joy I got to keep doing what God wants me to do if I don't what hope do they have right right and that's not easy it's not easy especially when you want everybody to be happy we want everybody to be happy joyful and enjoy the blessings but we got a powerful enemy that's pulling in the other direction that's right so we have to be equipped and realize that we have to seek our own not what the pastor does not what the Deacon does not what this sister or this brother does not what my parents not with my kids it's me and the Lord Lord what do you want me to do with this word that you're giving me and I have to seek out my own salvation with fear and trembling wisdom key number five fight and manage so when we're talking about fighting and managing what is it all about it's the factors of life we want to manage the factors of life God's way see finances is just one but you got faith I like to call these the fs Faith Family Fitness finances friends future fun all of those things that's a lot to manage but we have to manage these factors of life God's way amen these are all the elements and conditions that influence our life that's what they're all about that's what it's reflecting here right you say well fun huh yeah by God's grace we had the the marriage banquet yes fun is part of it and see that's what we have to be able to show our children it's fun to serve the Lord amen you know fun when I'm talking about fun I'm talking about Joy rejoicing in the Lord being happy people being happy people our Prophet said we should be the happiest people on the Earth but are we showing that my goodness are we showing that I have been on a journey to have fun I'm telling you you know it is serious but fun is serious when it's in the right way right amen you know to smile with your bride to be happy in your relationship to show your kids that we do have fun we do things that we laugh we have fun we smile I try to be more loose I'm telling you you know I I am trying because it's important okay because we want to show that Joy Paul in Philippians was one of my favorite chapter he says rejoice in the Lord and again I say rejoice make sure you are rejoicing that you're having a good time in the Lord amen he said let your moderation be known the Lord is at hand he's with us he's with me kids I have nothing to worry about parents dad sad people I am happy in the Lord do you know he supplies all of my needs amen and he's faithful with his part and I know if I'm faithful with his part I see it that's what gives me the rejoicing aspect of it I will never forget our Prophet saying and I tell my wife this all the time that the prophet said the the the man went fishing and he came back he had the fish in his hand and he's like brother Bram I know God loves me look at all these fishes he's given me amen well that's what I do I said Lord I might not fish but Lord you've given me a lot to manage praise God you've given me a lot to manage and I thank you for it you've given me wonderful children you've given me a beautiful wife you've given me a home you've given me all of these things Lord to manage right so I thank you Lord praise the Lord thank you Lord You're supplying all my needs and these practical things we may say they're oh well that's not a miracle no it's a miracle it's a miracle that we're still standing in this day and hour praise God and as we're faithful with these smaller things we will see him in the larger things amen but let your children let your family see these Miracles that he's doing they may seem like oh well no that's what the world wants you to think well God is in it you worked hard you the one you're the one that did this you're the one that saved no it's God that allowed that to happen it's God that allowed that to happen praise the Lord amen and I always tell her she's been paying her tithes Faithfully she see she's been working now we have experiences and um you know one of the experience that we had now I hope she's not embarrassed by this but her car unfortunately she had a small accident in her car but this is where I want to tell you the the grace of the Lord in it we talked about it we said okay here's the type of insurances that you can have you can have full coverage or you can have just U liability and we talked about it and she said you know what I I think I want full coverage said well okay let's let's do it let's do full coverage thank the lord we did it amen but I told her hey see you paying your tithes look how God can bless you okay he can bless you while you're paying you didn't get hurt and you're able to get your car restored think about it so you think you can get AE on God by not paying your tithes huh that could have been messed up all of your hard work and everything but God is watching out when we do things God's way amen praise the Lord so these are the factors of life Faith Family Fitness finances friends future fun yes so when we talk about your future it's it's life you're going to get older it's being a steward of all of those things you know I just found out yesterday the best person to take care of you when you're older yes we thought as the Lord he's certainly there he's taking care of you all through but the best person to take care of you when you're older is the younger you it's you right now I said Lord help me yes the younger you take care of your older self now start saving Fitness it's not just your Fitness but your mental health Amen brother Brenham he doesn't say mental mental health but he says mental condition that was the term back then Google see what he says don't Google look at the the table you'll see him say mental condition he said God can restore a sane mind and this is the hour that Satan is doing everything to mess our mental conditions up so Fitness is very important it's not just exercising and it's having the right mental mind in this hour and that only comes from Jesus Christ and applying his word in your situation practically practically of course family we got all the family relationships we know that faith and we know faith we know in this hour it's building to that Perfection that's the next wisdom key there's more required of the Bride in this age faith is the beginning we have to come to perfection in this hour it's required for us so you can see in this day it's everything because God has given us everything it's not the early stages of Faith it's the end where we have to come it is now required so in all of these areas God wants us to be Overcomers overcome understand what the will of God is next wisdom Keys full of obedience and the bride entitles her to him his token being fully obedient entitles her to him you know I think of the Lord and He is of course he's here in his word he's here in his holy spirit but the literal Body of Christ our our bridegroom he's not here and I said wow I was thinking about this I said he is such a man my he's so mature he's gone to prepare us a kingdom and he's left us a love letter he's left us the word to tell us how to live to tell us everything that we needs to to do while he's away and he's eager to come back just as much as we are to get to him but he has to do what he has to do okay and in the message future home brother B said he's preparing that Kingdom right now for his bride so he's over there working he's over there getting it all ready for us and our job on this life's journey he knows it's going to take our life this entire Journey because he knows what eternity is right so it's not a problem for him just like we would take our little kid to kindergarten and the baby and the young man or young girl they're crying because they're going to be away from you for five hours half day you know and they're like no no it's the end like no it's going to be okay and some of the parents they sit in the classroom and trying to just I got to get this boy going you got to grow up son you know but they're like oh no please no you heard parents taking the kids back home and trying to do it two and three days some of the kids are ready they're bye-bye But ultimately to a mature parent you realize the kid is going to cry you know what but two or three days they're going to be okay and then they're going to be home and that's how God feels he knows it's going to take our life he knows it's going to take an entire life for us to master these things to become stewards of all of these things in our life but we're going to Eternity so for him it's okay it's going to be some tears he understand but in the end he's going to come back to receive us and we will be with him for eternity praise the Lord the bride has to mature to be just like her husband when they when they unite they will be one and go home that's the journey that we're on trying to master all these things I have the musician come my it's just so much around this to share but that that is the key to it all last quote says Godly wisdom the skillful and practical application of God's will in your life Proverbs 3:7 says this it says get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee wisdom remember what wisdom is is the principle thing it's the main thing it's what we have to do practically we got to apply what we're hearing we got to do it if you're hearing the word today and we're going to hear the word come forth today you should be thinking Lord what are you telling me to do is it pray more is it read more is it to reach out to someone is it talk Lord what do I do practically because Lord I have to apply what I'm hearing the church is on fire it's not sitting still it's moving ahead in the Lord wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all you're getting get understanding why are you then doing what you're doing tie it up God is able to give us that wisdom and that will see us through on this journey God bless you again so much more we can share but we at time God bless you again look for how you can apply these things in your life Financial Jubilee is just a pattern but we have everything we need to apply to get to where we want where God wants us to be in this day and hour God bless you amen amen
