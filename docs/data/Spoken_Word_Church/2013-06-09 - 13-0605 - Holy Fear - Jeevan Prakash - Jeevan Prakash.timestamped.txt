[1:28:58] you fear that you might displease him in
[1:29:01] some
[1:29:04] way you fear lest you would do something
[1:29:08] wrong you would not want to I fear my
[1:29:13] mother I fear my my my wife I fear my

[1:29:21] unless I should put a stumbling block
[1:29:24] somewhere in their way I fear the people
[1:29:26] I fear the people of the city unless I

[1:29:55] hallelujah I'm finishing it brother
[1:29:58] within five few minutes now you take of
[1:30:01] instance the man is a farmer or maybe is
[1:30:05] a shopkeep shop worker and nobody pays
[1:30:09] any attention to him but let him get a
[1:30:11] job on the police
[1:30:14] force and come down the
[1:30:17] street there's a policeman with his
[1:30:20] badge and uniform on
[1:30:22] where maybe someone wouldn't speak to
[1:30:24] him a day before
[1:30:27] hello there
[1:30:29] John how are you see why is it it's kind
[1:30:33] of an A or a fear or a disrespect
[1:30:38] because of it maybe he gets elected to
[1:30:40] the mayor of the city or
[1:30:43] maybe and that the because of that God
[1:30:46] is God he deserves a respect amen that's
[1:30:51] right and we have got to respect him and
[1:30:54] give a fear to him and that brings
[1:30:57] respect amen God has demanded that for
[1:31:00] himself and all his servants God demands
[1:31:03] respect for his servants are we
[1:31:05] respecting the servant of
[1:31:08] God are we honoring the servant of
[1:31:12] God when we respect the servant of God
[1:31:15] we are respecting God his servants how
[1:31:18] we know that they are his servants
[1:31:20] because he indicates these servants by
[1:31:23] his word huh he takes these servants and
[1:31:27] makes them Servants of God and proves
[1:31:29] that they are servants by making his
[1:31:32] word work through them servants then as
[1:31:36] you respect that servant you respect God
[1:31:39] so when I respect you and you respect me
[1:31:42] and we respect each other then we are
[1:31:44] respecting
[1:31:46] God same thing you know sometimes we say
[1:31:50] I love God I love God I love God I love

[1:32:06] you are not loving them
[1:32:09] huh maybe maybe sometimes you know
[1:32:12] people show outward love you knowuh but
[1:32:15] inside they maybe they have you know
[1:32:19] scissors knives
[1:32:22] that's not called life
[1:32:25] love let the prophet of God said unless
[1:32:28] you have the perfect
[1:32:31] love Godly love perfect love there is no
[1:32:35] way going into the
[1:32:38] Rapture maybe you are a good Giver maybe
[1:32:41] you are a good Christian maybe you are
[1:32:44] reading the Bible every day maybe you
[1:32:45] are praising the Lord P you know but if
[1:32:48] you don't have the perfect love in you
