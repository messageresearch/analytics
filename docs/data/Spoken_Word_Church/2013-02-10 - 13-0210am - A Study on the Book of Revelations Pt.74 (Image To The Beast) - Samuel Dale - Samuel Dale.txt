have a good time and and all like that we may have to try to get a bigger place but we'll take care of that we'll we'll handle it and do it all right Lord with any man Revelations 1 and Revelations 13. dear Lord Jesus we thank you for all things we thank you for your love and your kindness unto us thank you for Calvary thank you for the the day and the hour that we're living thank you for the word that's been made known to us to where that we could be prepared against today and to see what's going on and realize the things that are happening we just look out and see the natural yes and Lord we look to see the spiritual path to see you living among us we love you and we thank you this blessing God each and every one of us and keep us in Jesus name amen Revelations one one through three the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which most shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel and to his servant John through my record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed it is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy who keep those things which are written therein or what the time is at hand Revelations 13 we'll begin reading with verse 11. and I'll be held another Beast coming out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and his fake as a dragon and he exercised all the power of the first Beast before him and causes the Earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed can you do a great Wonder so that he make a fire come down from heaven on the earth in the side of men and he deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound By The Sword and didn't live now watch the next verse and if you're running if you're running a reference on the image of the Beast if you run in your reference three ways there you'll get a whole lot more quotes and brother random will say image to the Beast he'll say image of the Beast he'll say image unto the Beast so you know it'll all tie together so watch now here it says the image to the Beast which we had to wound By The Sword and did allele and he had power to give life into the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be like killed you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing we won't wound down into the other person we're trying to to stay in a line to you know to just be able to follow our thought we're going to be talking today on the image to the Beast and like I said run it in then you'll see image of the Beast you'll see image unto the Beast and that way you'll you'll get a whole lot more quotes if you'll do it another way from the prophet all right now what have we been doing we've been taking these things to see what these will be and we know these things that we have covered and want to keep covering from not um you know you go over to the seventh chapter 8 chapter 9 10 11 12 and up to the 13th and you're seeing that that's covering only a three and a half year period of time upon the earth called the tribulation of Israel and you see all of these things and they say as we're beginning to see them my point is to get us to work that we can understand what's going on and I mentioned the other day you know that we uh we were reviewing a lot of these things and the sister said you're not reviewing it to me so that's the first time I've heard it right so that's maybe that's good to work that we can do it you know what meaning is you know this going through these things one right after the other and I pray that the Lord will bless us and and give us understanding ears to hear because even though we're not in the tribulation if we've covered the because the Rapture goes up into chapter four therefore one and then the bride the prophet says not seen until chapter 19 coming back riding into the Millennium all right then these things are to Israel and what's transpiring but we can look at the things that are here and see where they started at right like the seals and things see go all the way back to Genesis and start and come down to where we're at and then get down here and then we can understand what will transpire right and why it will be those things and why the Antichrist will come into being and and why the man of sin will sit in the temple of God and showing himself to be as God because we can see how it starts back here and unfolds down through but the main thing is to see that these things is to Israel but remember we see our day in this hour upon the Earth to to walk there in and then we we're trying to do I'll try to if I can remember it if I don't get down far enough run around actually covers on the image of the Beast about he said Luther started out with the truth sure he said but then they denominated right and he said they started forming the image to the Beast he said Wesley done wonderful starting out with the truth he said but then Dayton begin to denominate well see Luther even though brother Brown will use Luther news Wesley but remember Luther never denominated in church right let's be never denominated in the church right but the people after them you know went on to denominate and and cause into things and there's where your image to the Beast you'll see that it will begin to unfold and you can see it's right Among Us right right here now because you know that's what's taking place all right but now what I want to do is to just drop back and and we'll just start and see kind of in the 13th chapter because this this chapter has more to do with us then say basically the others because it's showing uh America and where it's at right and showing how we come into being you know and what is the reason for us and what we're doing and that's what I want you to see is the the thing right now Among Us right here right see we can look as as we did before and say well we don't know what these symbols are we don't know what this means we don't know what that means but when a prophet comes along and talks about is we'll read in a minute like the two horns you know the Lamb with two horns he said that was the American Buffalo right well he's putting it right down to where we live right you know and then on your your your Indian Head pennies and things you know woman to the nation because America is in the 13th chapter of the Book of Revelation you know as it's coming forth and manifestation but remember you you when you look at something even though this takes place right here the scripture is telling you where it's at right but yet there's got to be a lead up to it right So It Begins back there see it didn't begin as a beast it was covering the seals in the Thunder it began as a Antichrist and really it didn't begin as the Antichrist Innovation is what we look at it it began just as a Saiyan a little Doctrine right a little idea that's right yeah what don't you think like I try to get you to look it up you know what that and I see him counselor 325 A.D you know well they just come in there saying that Jesus was not the same substance of God we'll see you could argue and say well the bodies this and God is this and that enrolled just that little thing began to bring in enough until you would eventually wind up with a community Doctrine right coming forth amen all right see then it's all leading up and that's what I'm wanting us to look at it but let's go back into what we've we've covered a little and we're going to use it and just read it and make sure that we follow this throughout the early chapter of the Book of Revelations go ahead brothers and pull up the the uh things and we'll just read it but I want you to think about it we'll read it we'll stop in a verse read something verse maybe a little on this because you know if I ever get time I told my wife the other day I said I want to get in the Book of Romans and take Romans 1. and explain it in verse 2 and verse 3. I want to do that I used to do that a lot you know and I'd like to get back into there but I'm just tied up too much maybe in the Millennium we'll get back there but now notice see it says in verse 1 and I stood upon the sand of the sea standing up here see and saw a beast rise up out of the sea and then seven horns seven heads ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon the heads of the name of blasphema all right now this one right this beach Rises up out of the sea now well we read in 11th verse we'll see the one coming up out of the earth that is more of the United States right right this is Rome coming forth into the seven heads and and the horns and the things the crowns is the Roman Catholic Church that rules the world spiritually in the extent of what they're doing and you know that they just recently if you'll run it in on Google you'll find it's been in there probably a while but Brother Richard brought my attention if you'll run in on Google you'll find it and just type in uh sing for the Pope you know where he's wanting a seat to be set aside for him in the upper room in the upper room he wants it set aside a seat for him in the upper room and his point of saying is that people can come to see these things it's this gradually little things coming in you know there's a lot of Catholic shrines in in Israel there's a lot of places you go down like where where the angel appeared to marry Bethlehem remember that one and and you're going to go into a Catholic Church that's built there with the place of where the water is running there's a lot of Catholic things are but now see with the the Jewish people I was thinking yesterday about they don't care about all of them shrines being put up as long as they're getting the money that's right they're only concerned with the money coming in they don't care how much right because they're not Christians that's right they wasn't here and they don't care to make all of these covenants with you know with Rome why because they're not Christians as we call it you know they don't accept Jesus Christ see they're still under their old doings and they'll go back to their sacrifices one day but it's getting ready see they have to go through the government to get it okay that's right so he wants him a seat sitting right up there in the Upper Room all right I say give him a seat let him put all he wants to do on there yeah because that's just going to bring that much more amen right and bring us into being but you see what we're talking about now what is it the seven heads the only place in the world sets on seven he opened his Rome Italy Cincinnati Ohio does but it's not a religious center it's ruling the world this is the Beast that rises up out of the sea out of the people the multitudes is out there what's your prophet in a minute when he defines America right right you know and you're so specific of the wording that he uses but look and the Beast which I saw was like under a leopard and see where is the feet of a bar and like a lion and a dragon we know that dragon is wrong right so we went through coming down through the the Nebuchadnezzar and then down through the the Greeks and the the Alexander and coming on down to the Natural government of Rome you know the Romans were ruling the Known World basically of the time of Christ right all right then in doing that then we see things happen because we got into verse 3 in one of it heads where it wounded at the death and the deadly wound was healed and the world wandered after the Beast we found what that was when natural Rome could no longer rule it was a nation it could no longer Rule and be deceiving right but what happened was in natural Rome Pagan Rome as we call it the natural Roman world see was annihilated all right but you see it coming right back up in right because they had many gods they had many kinds of things and then you see them right over and you see Constantine helping the church and and all of the things that was taking place and just bringing it in and what then Hagan wrong become what Apple wrong and brother random you want this quote run around and said they say we're the first church he said that's exactly right that's right man he said the early church the bride the church what the nazia Rome and a lot left and went back home but what did they bring a Doctrine sure they didn't go over there and showing up with it and all they seen what it was and they left right but what did they bring little ideas you called little sayings and when it did Apple Rome come into bed because remember now this Beast is going to have to rule the world and Rome in the government they lost that ability right I mean but yet now the Catholic church has the ability to control the world called who can make war against him like I was showing you there the other day we're over there in you know the country where the pope came from back in where was it Poland and they just stopped the whole thing by walking out there in this military wouldn't fire on them food they look at it all around the world tonight but watch them and they worship the Dragon that's not some kind of a dragon with a thing and you're bowing down and no it's when you're beginning we'll get more into the market of these than a hundred base okay it's when the the Roman ideas like I said a moment ago they had many gods well then they couldn't accept one God no under their religious ideas because they were still so much natural wrong that spirit that that pain was controlling and then they started putting up mini knives and naked Peter one making this one one making that one my friend said they took down the images of their other things and put up people you know like Mary and starting to do it right and what it did what's began to happen they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast said who is likened to the Beast who is able to make war with him yeah all right now spiritually speaking who's able to make war yep with him because you see your ability to speak now is vastly going away yeah that's right you know amen you think that it's not even meaning for that but for you to even use uh you know the words gay and stuff like that you can be tried for hate crime now who do you think is behind all that right right who do you think is controlling when Reagan and the pope got together and done away with Communism wasn't that something yeah let's just wipe out a nation because they done it with her own dogs that is going through it but think who is able to make war with him now we'll get on down in a minute on this with the image of the Beast because anybody right now could drop a bomb on the vatically you know we know they won't they won't but I mean it could because the government you know it's a thing and Rome Italy is actually a government it is a government within the government all right you agree I'd consider about Washington D.C if I was you Washington DC is a government within the government it is not a state it is a government within the government kind of that's why we're getting to the image of the beast but who's able to make war see here's where now we're going to come into being because who could make war now when they declare a problem in a country who's the first groups to go it's supposed to be the United Nations right it was set up for the United Nations and he's going to put so many troops from each country into a police force and when you did then if anybody went wrong you just sent that Force well it was their own people to be sent right back on them right it was a good idea but veteran said it won't work right all right but see who's the first one to go to all these places the United States because who's able to make war against the United States we have the Firepower we have the ability watch it a minute what your Prophet says those a lot of those things are we're the only nation in the world that has the ability to control the world he said well we're not able to do this we could do anything right in Vietnam my brother-in-law knew a high-ranking official and he said we don't need nuclear Wars to stop that he said we've got the ability to take them out this was a high-ranking man he said we had them ever want to almost captured and said we had orders to back out and said we sat there and let them walk out to be a communist thing yeah the you can't have the control right look over there what's China to us he's always afraid of this my friend now we're afraid of the rest of the world joining up with them because they don't have the ability not supposed to be to be able to bring a bomb over here if it did it'd be limited well all we've got to do is fly up no more China no more Russia but they won't let us do it right right they won't let us do it even so much control is on even a little country of Israel until they won't let them defend themselves the yet they can drop bombs on them every day you know rockets and missiles are flying in there every day but they're not allowed to even tell a lot of times those things are happening right somebody's controlling this thing and it certainly is not a governmental United States see it's something else it's recording you know coming in and taking over and I remember back years ago a lot of you in early ones in the message back in the 60s and 70s everybody was against the Illuminati you remember that for super rich the illuminatis boy everybody and there was people in the message that quit paying income taxes and all kind of things you know to try to protest stuff like that ain't nothing but a flash up in the front of you like run around and said don't worry about communism he says there's no scripture that it'll ever rule the world right he said but worry about Catholicism so don't worry about all the iron curtains and the thing he said you better be concerned with the purple one yeah that's right amen wrong right and they're gradually taking over yes but they're not and you know as far as I know even till now that the Catholic church is not the last I heard years ago they're not even a member of the World Council of churches but they have delegates there that was 20 30 years ago or more than that they have delegates there what are they doing the Bible says he's going to come in according to the Book of Daniel Comes In by flattery he's invited in and you know to come in and running like Wade was talking about in the Dave Ramsey thing or what he was just saying oh you know if you wanted somebody to run your bank that you've had would you go out on the street and get a bomb that ain't never you know he he been bankrupt what all his life and don't no you don't get damn you get a man's in charge well who's got the wealth to the world today the prophet years ago when gold was 35 an ounce was talking about the Catholic Church having billions and billions of dollars of gold when would be the best guy to run the world right now amen surprising to me I would have probably voted to what was his name the one that run against Obama because he was a big man he had made great billions he was a smart guy if you want somebody to run the country get a smart guy and get a rich guy he's got a lot of Investments his Investments is going down see what you see what I'm talking about right the control comes in gradually until it just squeezing out right why because we're forming the image to the Beast right we've got the power to rule the world the Catholic Church doesn't have a a a military power so you got to have the image of the Beast to raise up to be the military power and see then we're going to do what they say is that true who is able to make war with him we'll get back more than the image of the Beast and looking worse five that was given unto him a mouth-speaking great things and blasphemies the power was given unto him to continue for him too much that's in the tribulation right 1260 days right she wasn't worth that and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blasting his name and his Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven now before I've never heard the pope Blanche theme he's always been sweet but when he says he's instead of God come on folks amen when he says he said instead of God that's blaspheming God run and I say if you notice in this if you look there's a lot of times black stainless blacks theme is in 13th chapter right and he's talking about an image to the Beast and he's talking about image of the Beast and he's talking about blasphemen then you get over in about the 17th chapter somewhere along in there and you'll find out that it's the names of glass things and run around there you remember in the message blessing his name said that's what he called him he said instead of saying names of last names he said call the Blasphemous names because that's what it is he's in Methodist Madness Presbyterian Pentecost who may I add brown eyes anybody gonna get mad at me for saying that everyone I mean you better believe I I'm if you you just wait on down the road if this thing goes on a little while they're going to be trying to get us together because we're beginning to get to be a big group of people in the world right there's Millions following this message now don't you think that they're going to try to get us in the world Council churches of course well we don't have to go thank you if we have their Doctrine no we got the message of the hour Two Souls haven't done a virtual proves you River Jordan yeah why do we get to the image of the bees I believe the biggest thing is going to come right out of this message amen amen the college we're the closest thing the Bible said he's raised up a standard right right amen all right amen but now look he opens his mouth in blasphemen against God I never heard the Pope get out and swear and cuss and raise his fist and shake it at God have you always sweet he's nice we're all the same who was this last Pope you know before this one wasn't him or the one before him one was had the great thing of getting all the churches together right yep and Bella Lucci or what his name is speaking you know that mine said God don't like you calling us and things remember flattery ease in on it get into our mind get in our thinking well they're good people out there brother Dale right sure was I don't know I've never read where Hitler had any kids or not you know but if he'd had any kids his kids was thought he was a good guy but now look he was given unto him to make war with the Saints now that's not the bride she's done gone in the Rapture okay this is the 42 months up above our this is the Tribulation these Saints is the 144 000 and the foolish virgins right you remember how we covered on the 12th chapter that it was the remnant of the woman's seed that the remnant of the woman said to the river of Israel is 144 000. that's what your Prophet said the remnant of the Bride is the foolish version right amen all right well see we're not over here it's not us we're not the signs make war with the Saints and overcome them in power to give them to him over all kindreds tongues and Nations now you said what what brother Daniel they're in every country in the world today ruling the world how many Catholics do you have in the White House right and all the growth on the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life in the last name before the foundation World I'll take that back out into YouTube on another message later all right but this is where I live If any man have an ear let him hear when we get down to the to the Beast and the doings of his number and it said to him that have to understand wisdom understanding he that lead us into captivity shall go into captivity see we deal with this one a lot he that killed his assortments from being killed with the sword uh you know here you deal with that a lot but what about he that leadeth into captivity she'll go into captivity you realize I Pastor a church you realize I'm responsible for somewhere in close to 100 Souls that's right I'm not responsible for you out there on the internet system that are listening because I'm not your pastor but even my voice is going out there you know what if I teach a false Doctrine I'm going into captivity right amen right and you know what I'm going to do I'm going to leave you into captivity so you better know this message it doesn't bother me for you to say brother Dale what does this mean mighty brother random say so and so here I'm glad you're reading listening to tapes I want you to do those things and if I'm off somewhere come and tell me all right all right could I've got it made see I've always told you this if I'm wrong and you show me it's off your shoulders number one that's right but number one is I can accept truth and get straightened up right but if I'm right now I'm still okay and still not a dogmatic hateful old guy that tries to push everything over on everybody to make them believe it I preach something and I go on down the road because I've never been one to just keep arguing with people about it right words that ever solved anything yeah it's a it's a jump in a quote it's a grabbing the scriptures and like the Church of Christ man said I I got a scripture shoot down your scripture you know like it's all messed up which one do you want you know we'll see I'm sorry I'm just no never was made that away when the brother got up that time and he said go to the Daniel 70 weeks he said well there's seven no over here they're talking about seven over here they're talking about three and a half he said we'll just make it feel nice now that wasn't no answer to nobody that was mass confusion amen see church I'm trying to get you and I to to realize the truth but mainly in this part of the series since we got up into these things is to get you and I to see where we're at you think it can't be done but your money can be gone before you get home yes but brother Dave I don't believe that's under persecution yeah well I will remind you that in about 20 something they had a crash of the economy here in America called the Great Depression right right that's right you don't think that we're so great until we can't be right a Great Depression struck and overnight people were jumping out of Windows giving themselves but you didn't have anything to do yeah they set up rules mad brother Dale laws is in in places that can't go so far all you can do is close the bank will you close the bank and I can't get my money where am I at all right around said if you knew what you had in your pocket you'd take it out and burn it he said keep your homes and take the mark of the beast me I don't believe in the bride going through the tribulation no way in the world right but it can get pretty drastic right right that's right why because it's going to take something to bring even out of the right place but listen George were you are you following me what I'm trying to say looking in our day and where we're at the great land of America and thank God for it and like I said the other night there was nowhere in the world any other country would have the the materialistic ability to put this message and walk to the fork to the world in America I Don't Preach all doomsday how bad we are how bad this is done I'm glad that God chose an American that spoke our language to bring the message to us because if not you'd be at the mercy of somebody translating it to you which could mean one Higher left off that's right and we got it bad enough because we're human right you know speaking what are you following me I'm not looking for horrible things I'm just going every day being what I am if it comes we deal with it right that's right you can't figure it out that's right no because once you get it figured out it's not going to happen that way right that's it that's what everybody says well the coming of the Lord is going to be on a certain day when if you can say that then you're out of the Bible before you start because the Bible says you can't know today some of your Liars start with people don't like that see they like they grow the house somebody that's made all these predictions and all these things they'd rather listen to somebody like that than to listen to somebody that stood in 1974 and said this thing can go to 2026 and not break the profits message nor in the Bible and many people have ever wanted to hear that all right nobody they don't even ask me well how did you come up with that what you see Church they don't want you they want somebody that's we see why she you know why because they wish you my right as most Crooks get caught they don't want to be a group by themselves because they got that bad conscience thing in them you know they want to tell it to the world and then what was the man out there in Alabama he wanted to make a statement he knew when he went under there with that boy he killed that man he knew he wasn't coming out alive he just wanted to make a statement it's hard I know they never did let him make you stable what you see people don't want to just stay by themselves they want to tell it like I tell Robinson Robbie they don't got a lot of problems Robbie said well that's all right we all have problems see I'm not but I'm sat in the morning I gotta I got somebody this is as bad as I am maybe I kill four guys and he and he only had got a nose somewhere but he's got problems too he said I said they're not sure see because we try to justify our own selves and run it in our own ways come on I hope you wrote like that let's go again and I love that ninth verse If any man happen here right now let him hear but remember he that leads into captivity she'll go into captivity with his Doctrine you watch the people of this message and you see them you know the old saying this you never stand alone right yeah when you look at the doctrine for this message and look what they're doing in the Foreign Fields when those four old people don't have the ability to quote back to them I've been there in the Philippines and they said there's a day when we didn't have a book to argue with them said we was at the mercy of what they were saying wrote around and say it yep think what about him but look if we take the sword we're going to be killed by we know what that means well what about taking the sword of our tongues and trying to kill everybody with it okay we look at verse 11 now we get to the mark of the biggest and I'll be held at another Beast come up out of the Earth he had two horns like a lamb and he expected as a dragon now this one comes up out of the Earth right all right so look what happens coming up out of the earth go ahead with number two while we're not a denomination 1958 927. look what the prophet is talking about Scarlett he's talking about the woman said Upon A Scarlet country Beast and the Bible represents royalty color Scarlet means red and beasts represent power did you notice the bees come up out of the sea now the first one come to power the sea all right that was in the in the revelations the 13th and when you see the Beast coming up out of the sea it meant that this power was raising up among the people because I got one in a minute would run around and even said he said to people from Europe roll it over but in Revelation 13 when this lamb came up you know which was the second beast we just read about where's he come from came up out of the Earth look no people I watched right around when he's so specifically explaining something but do you understand what he's explaining see there was a time there was no people in America now we talk about the Indians was here or this was there or that was our but you know he's talking about you know people we came over here right so there was a time there was no people so this piece is going to raise up out of the Earth you and I are the people so what came about the Earth First Beast come about a sea second beast come down the Earth we just read it in the street no people United States but then after he had been after him he had two little horns see one of the ecclesiastical powers and then he received the powers played like a dragon did before him so you just got to mark it down we're coming into a religious persecution with the same things that they did in Pagan Rome many years ago for it's thus saith the Lord now what is it setting up on a beast of power there we go coming into a religious persecution that's odd he could say thus saith the Lord you see people say we're not going to go through persecution we're going to be taken up I know where the quotes are we're not going to be close enough we're going to be taking her right because of religious persecution is not closing you up right let's just take them taking over and doing nothing right all right but you see what I'm talking about look where he describes the United States on the mark of the beast number three 54 513. and we'll read that read it on down in the 13th chapter of Revelation here look here at a time look here at the 15th verse is where it's not about the Beast you know where and I just a minute I want to go back before that and see and we see your word that he was standing here by the seaside now I want to just find a place where the 11th verse and I beheld another Beast coming up out of the Earth the outer not out of water out of the Earth the first one expanding John the John standing and he seems to come up out of the sea the second we're going to follow the Earth then the statements of multiputed people is look in water then this is where there was no people in the United States now look what he said and he had two horns like a lamb two horns like a lamb not a lamb me what is it our American buffalo God is an animal right purecy there he is two horns like but then what did he do and freedom of religion lamb but remember he never did become an old Ram what did you say he was a lamb this country is only 150 years old you know what just the Lambs it's not old enough to be an old Ram now watch this in a second he sprayed like a dragon he ever found all the power first he said before him the red dragon he called all that was in the earth that Drew up on the earth to worship the Beast whose wound was he that everyone was ill and he does great wonders yeah and the next verse on down I believe it is it even says that the Miracles he can perform but look what your Prophet said they are doing makes him a fire told to so to make him a fire come down out of Heaven the atomic bomb sure yeah there ain't some guy standing out there fire come down to heaven you tell me what it is atomic bomb hydrogen bomb intelligent nation and so forth deceiving the Nature's Nations by these things so these things should be coming down into a more simple understanding a prophet saying that is that this Beast has the ability to call down fire see we're looking for some guy to walk out there you know the prophet says it's Atomic power right word Atomic power start jury Russia would do with Japan mainly Germany and Japan was dealing with it that's why we went in there and took those scientists whether you know your history or not we went in there and divided those countries that's why the Berlin Wall was putting or where we could get half the people out of there to be our scientists and they could have the other half see Russia will come in right Russia come in World War II Russia was being defeated up there and we went to the Rain the most sensible thing to have been done in that day was back off and say blowing to pieces and then we'll blow you to pieces right but no we want to help so we went and conquered and gave Russia all the equipment and then we divided the world in law we got the big scientists they got the big signs don't you remember many many years ago I remember this statement was made in the paper see did when they send a rocket this was before but said when they sent a rocket to the moon said two scientists would step out and Shake Hands one from the U.S and one from Russia will step out and shake hands because that's what it is come on church it's just a point of looking at it see the fire coming down out of Heaven is atomies what did they do in World War II they blasted that places Smithereens that's right Gilmore with two bombs and had been killed in a lot of the other times of the war who has power to do that United States who has the ability to do that you know you know I'll drop back your scripture you'll see it I make number four and the answer is not all the power of the first weeks before him and called the Earth and then with their end to worship the Beast whose name the wound was healed this Beast is coming forth the deadly wound was healed begging wrong become powerful wrong you have great wonders show that he make a fire come down from the heaven on the earth and the side of men you think about it see we're over here to where we see things but what if you were in some backwards country to a word that you you would never even maybe seen white people you were living back to Irish as people in the jungle from night what would happen if a helicopter sit down and a guy jumped out with these great big things all around his head and all this suit he had on and then he takes his fire thing and he you know a gun he'd go and just burns a jungle what you think I'd fall down and start worship anymore you do I certainly know a whole lot greater than I am see what he can do he does great wonders making Fire come down from heaven on the earth and the side of me and nuclear stuff think about it and to see with them Miracles which he had power to do in the shot of the Beast these two in the side of the Beast one the image of the Beast you're talking of two beasts right right but it's not released it's one beast and an image to the Beast amen right all right because he describes who the Beast is the one that had the wounded was healed we see the image of the Beast you have power to give life unto the image of the Beast this be strong gave life where did we come from where did we get all of our doctrines and ideas right where did where did it off base though I'm talking Brother Richard this morning and I said well I'm back to eating the cough drops but listen look at number five we'll get a few more questions there'll be two forms of them taken from Oneness of unity 1958-128 paragraph or page 45 portal there'll be two forms of them one form will come from Rome which will be will be the Beast there is an image of the Beast which we will be the ecclesiastical head of the Protestant church keep up as an image unto the Beast under the denominational world they'll all come under one great Dominion and the Antichrist will be the one that's enthroned and seated May understand sits in the temple of God's humans have to be have done right yep enter against almost exactly not but yet his teaching isn't from the scripture another scripture to make it look like that is right it'll be wrong you see we started out over here for Religious Freedom right and then we took their very Doctrine you know right the very Doctrine right he said but I'm not a Catholic but I'll tell you what I asked my sisters that I told you I said what's the difference in the Catholic Doctrine and the Baptist she said we worship Mary we worship Jesus they worship Mary I said uh yeah someone we'll get dark when we get into the mark of the beast you realize to have the same Doctrine you're the image of what you're looking at if you have the same Doctrine now don't misunderstand this before we get down to it in the Baptist Church there was a dozen splits of different forms of doctrines and ideas so everybody's not going to say the same you understand what I'm getting at it's never going to be that everybody says the same it's just that you go along with it because you're part of the system and you form an image to the Beast which means the exact likeness of it whatever Doctrine the Beast has you have that Doctrine that's right but when you tell me there's two Lords all right then you've got two Gods you're back like it was at the Nicene Council of 325 A.D then when you tell me that Jesus wasn't god Till The River Jordan right then you're saying the same thing they did and then I see in councilman 325 A.D that's right because that's where they were arguing over whether he was the same substance or a like substance bringing it down to our day that's why I tell you what you listen to is up to you right I've never told nobody you can't listen to somebody else but when you bring that back here that's right and you start among the people and start talking about brother so-and-so's got a good thing going then you're going to find brother Dale in the Pulpit right addressing it right right amen okay right because I'm responsible for your soul because they're not now right I know I'm late for me I don't want nobody to leave this church whatsoever I never have but if you're going to believe somebody else's Doctrine go with that Doctrine and that person amen that's right now you just think you know everything no but I know who does have all the answers right I got a Bible and I got a prophet's message amen all right do you say well well that's just better way of seeing it we got one Holy Ghost one interpreter of the word all right one revealer of the word yep well brother that's what I don't like about you because you just think you're the only one that's got it no I've always told you I ain't worried about it because ain't other people's got it because it's not made for Lula ice on me it's made for the Bride of the around the world and there's people out there that believe the truth amen but there's a lot out there that believe all kind of perverted doctrines that's right that you can have three or four wives that you can help this you can have that right yeah making a good denomination I mean that's right we don't make a good denomination don't link me with that don't tell me one of these days I'm gonna have to sign papers to agree that the people of this message just got the truth I ain't gonna do it but what do you mean they got the truth nah you didn't listen I said for you to make me sign a paper to say the message of this people this message is not the truth this message is the truth amen but the people in this message is most perverted people there are in the world that's right to believe any Doctrine any idea that's right right amen and then turn around and try to destroy the very message that's right you tell me that ain't the image of the Beast you tell me this thing ain't reached his Apex in this people of the message that's right just reached this height in this day Satan now has you know that right around said when when baptized that they accepted let's see if unquote right when they accepted Barabbas instead of Jesus run around and said Satan was exalted to the throne he always wanted personal Warden when they accepted Barabbas instead of Jesus he said that puts Satan to a strong well what do you think it's being done now but the people have taken this message and twisting in it and saying to run around and said so and so what about if you was at the mercy that you had no quotes you say well I never would do it do it son I've been there and talked to people that women years ago in a church I ain't calling no names there was women in that church getting ready to see who they was going home with that night and you know the names if I called them because it was being taught to them that they're supposed to have a head and some of them didn't have a husband that the husband could have a whole bunch of wives because he didn't have enough men to go around you know and you know what I'll lay them back to that in The Minister's meeting and you know what happened the pastor of that church ridiculed me and would not speak to me for probably five years and I saved them from going into adultery yeah that's right that's why my brother Dale's tired tired of putting up with garbage cans it's called this message you might be surprised one of these days I'm not coming here and start calling names of preachers I try to be nice but see some of you are listening to people that I'm talking about that's right and you think they're preaching a good message okay image to the Beast they look at the neighborhood what's your number six question and answers 54. 5 15. they had said what does the image of the beast mean all right considers a joint question he goes on and answers the Bible clearly teaches that the Catholic church is the the Beast the Bible teaches that obese means a power is that right a beast the Bible says that the Beast men of power and the Beast was the Vatican City the Catholic hierarchy all right now that was the power of the church that was the Beast build a Protestant Church come out of that of the Catholic church and organize himself a little power that is an image wrote it on that word if anything if something was made in my image it'd have to look like me it's something made in the image of this church you'd have to look like the church something was made to be made an image unto this Beast which was the Lutheran right right and now I maybe can't pronounce some words well that you know look there is right methodisms right madnessism right Pentecostal instrument isms or as it system that's what people don't want me to say it's okay to throw off on all of them over there all them is was formed into an organization and made an image just like the Beast there it is now do you say being brother Brown that all Catholics all messages and all Baptists are gone listen I didn't say that come on you take a quote up here make you say this what he said there's thousands and thousands and tens of thousands of morning increasing in those churches but in their organization they're trying to drive them to a Creed and they won't stand for it in a church when it organizes it comes under a Creed okay now you know what an organization is that's my brother remember there's a quote similar to this right around said you'd never be able to denominate this next year but to organize it into lay of seal because if you denominate it means you put up your poster outside you declare what you are and you're doing this and accept nothing else but when you organize it it means you got the same spirit so the Methodist the Baptist the Presbyterian the brand of mites they all got the same Spirit of the Catholic church and we'll get through the image of the beast when it's your Doctrine in your forehead right it's in the forehead it's not stamp 66. nobody wouldn't accept that it's your Doctrine in your forehead well brother now how do we know you better be know one thing for certain number one qualifications you better have the baptism of the Holy ghosts yes if you don't have that don't worry about the rest of it no that's right that's right you're deceived anyway right but mama was good and there's something wonderful they have their day and their times it's not for you and I that's right Sam brother Brown said Mama used to teach me that that what was it hell was eternal or different Doctrine or something that he was on he said I don't believe that no more right he was born awful mama that's right come on a thousands and ten thousands of Christians exactly all right let me see if I can find these over here all right hang on just a minute so you can see what I got and that's just that's not even the fourth of what's living in office when the image would be just run it in image of the Beast our image to the Beast our image unto the leaves let's run into computer let's see if I can find it right all right Hey Brother Anderson jumped to 14. I'm gonna give them no this is from the Seal of God preached 1954 5 14. you remember why I'm giving the dates remember that because sometimes they don't have the Jeffersonville up there so I gave you the date at least you can know what it is watch very said let us in the United States they said let us make an image unto the base if the Beast with the power the power was an organization not taking Theory now that's the word of God the organization of the Catholic Church organized himself together and make a agree and they accept what they call the early fathers together you go back and like I said while I don't run around to you say that the Catholic church is the first church you sit there and exactly right these they put my words do you know that the Catholic Church was the first people going out with the truth but do you understand what he's saying that's my wordings but then it got perverted organize yourself together May the agree exactly what they call the early fathers completely accept the in their teachings you know the the Bible and the thing and organizers came to the church and made a ritual in what they believed and what they would teach a universal belief and they forced it to the People by punishment now you know then what happened in the Dark Ages how they killed the people all right now then we come out of it with Martin Luther but look what he says about Martin Luther and then when Martin Luther come out seeing the spirit of God leading him out instead of letting the people stay free he organized the church an image like unto the Beast a political power locking into it instead of letting the peoples walk as God gives light they organize under a discipline and they have to stay to that discipline you go to some Churches and you join them you're going to a certain period of new age everybody in here that's ever been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all right if you go to a Baptist church today you could go to a Methodist or Presbyterian of Pentecostals and they wouldn't argue but if you go to the Baptist Church it is their Doctrine you got to go and be re-baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost in the Baptist Church now you're not going into the church you see they got rules set up what's the difference in that kitchen people you got to speak in drama right right you got to speak in tongues of how the Holy Ghost right what's the difference that's a discipline or a Doctrine or an idea what's the thing of the people in that do you believe the prophets met you that means you got the Holy Ghost my uncle devil believes it so he got it but he don't believe like I do I'll agree with you that's right he believes the truth and you don't hurt but all right you say you shouldn't be that way another day why not why not be that way look look on go around to uh what do we get going up it's on uh number 15 which is actually a continuation but nothing but in the Seal of God same message God moved right out into the mess of the church the mess in this church had a Revival that swept the world the holy spirit with them teaching sanctification and the first thing you know when they did that then they organized the church making an image unto the Beast that's right a political organized power we're Divine the people of God to agree instead of being free to worship and walk in the light as light was shown on their path think about it an image to the Beast that Beast bred around and said rose up in America there's one in here where he said they brought it from Europe that was one of the first comes up out of the sea all right we had to come over here by the ocean but then the image of the Beast was put right here and you realize that we have that Doctrine we're just as much Catholic as anybody in the world that's right just as much do you see why I'm so hard I guess because I've got to be protective of your soul okay amen now brother animal feminish motor what is that word that you use you know was he against women no no he went against women right he's against the wrong kind all right was he against churches no how many quotes do you want where he says go to these denominations and let your light shine a quote yeah let me just quote it for you he said let your light Chinese because they'll run you out do you see what I'm talking about just keep reading till you get all the answers right amen any quote by itself is a death to you that's right um let's see Church we've formed an image to the Beast here in America we have the material of power to control the world and we have the ability to send quotes message books Bibles and thanks to the world right and all that's good because it's finding the life seed and I'm all 100 for it right but it's just like I told the brother you've heard me before say it and it come out later I said you've been to these places and you've set up and done these things I'll try to work my word wasn't going to be so bad but they try to you know take in a doctrine of the message and produce wrote around was a prophet isn't that in the other that's wonderful but I said now what are you going to do next year when you go back to the same people right you got 200 this year next year you got 400. are you going to set that 200 and ain't heard nothing but right around was a profit are you going to set them down and make them go through this same thing again I said that ain't even sensible I said take that 200 and put them over to the side and let somebody teach them the prophet said okay the message came back I believe it was China I'm pretty sure it is when it came back later of saying this since you've told us that God sent a prophet now come and tell us what he taught I'm 100 for going and doing but I'm not going back to the same church next year and preach the same day message I preached that year I think we ought to be in growth development man you say well what do you mean I mean simply this I've been to these countries a few of them if I go back to any of those countries I'll try to progress in the message try to teach them deeper into the message I think that ought to be done you want to go tell them about the message but tell them what the prophet talk right then once you tell them they can fight these false doctors but until you tell them and give them the books and the things they can't fight with them and you know what it means give them to books if you don't give them somebody to teach them what's in the book you're netting the first reader you know what I mean by that see dick run see John run see this See Spot and you just get ready to see spot that's perfect we'll take somebody let them take some more books right let them explain the message in detail where they could fight the doctrines that are around them that's right that's all I've ever tried to say but you know what I've never been invited to go back because I made that statement that I thought to order progress in their teaching yeah but see I've never been invited to go back to that countries with anybody because they still think all it is to go around was a profit but around was a profit yep and then you sat there and marchy tongues and hear him say that brother rather was when it comes to John hope Atmos I don't know what I'm sorry I just can't see that you see Church the truth is hard to preach alive is easy to breathe that's right you'll get people to leave a lot on locker and you can believe the truth truth requires you to study lives requires you to listen to these things what about an image to the Beast right you mean you're talking about brother Dale that the people of this message will you show me where this thing in with the people of this message come on well then don't you think Satan is right here right what do you think he's using his intro it wasn't about Napoleon it wasn't it him which one was it that had the spot which was uh Sweden and I think right with it and he didn't want to talk about that place because there's one place he couldn't conquer Que the one place see Satan can't conquer the people of this message I'm not worried about that because truth's gonna come right God's going to raise up these young men like take over and preach because that's older Wonder dying going off and he'll bring the crook that's right somebody's going to make this message live not just talk about it not argue and fuss about it come on that's right somebody's going to take the message and become the message when I brought it that way out on the street corners and proclaim the message if you want to yeah that's a good idea but just make sure you tell the truth out there right right make sure you tell the truth doctor all right come on because it reflects back to here right and they say is that what you teach up there yeah I appreciate my mother-in-law it was somebody said something about it well up there where brother Dale did that or and all this stuff they just believe in beating their wives and everything else they asked my mother-in-law about it because they knew that I was her son-in-law you know and was preaching here she said I'll tell you one thing Sam Dale ain't gonna do that the last night y'all actually had that much confidence right she said he won't do that do it you know kind of ends the gospel don't it you ever notice it's really bad when you when you got something you want to tails up to everybody and nobody would want to hear it that's right you got some good gossip and you run among the neighbors and they say I already heard it turns you up you just want to go home and cry I'll jerk this message is not to be arguing first about it bring it into manifestation let the people do the manifestation then one thing about it they can't argue about it listening they can't argue the point because they will see it living right right we're going to send some prayer claws up to the baby there and we just want to everybody to pray and believe that it's all going to be all right so let's put some in here now for Amy and Jeffrey and put one in the babies and then there's just one Spire left over and kissing needed but we were there the other night and um just Gwen's mother there were some people having trouble over on the side there and we never didn't know what the trouble was but with no business of ours she said Sam said you need to go with her and pray with them people that they're having troubles so what he followed me we just walked over there and I should I'm a minister you know and I said they said that there was maybe some problems and honey we all need somebody to pray with you well they didn't jump up no blessed Garden one of them said see we've done parade with the chaplain I said okay I was just this woman you know volunteer my services Lloyd said this is my pastor here simply you see I wasn't wanting to make no big light and I didn't I just went on over and said I am but they thanked me for coming over there and saying that but I don't think they thought I was a bad age you know you see we don't have to scream and holler at the world just be ourselves you just do that and then the more take care of you so let's join hands together here father in the name of Jesus Christ we send these prayer clowns not only for little Eli we send them for Amy and Jeffrey horn that should take care of them probably we
