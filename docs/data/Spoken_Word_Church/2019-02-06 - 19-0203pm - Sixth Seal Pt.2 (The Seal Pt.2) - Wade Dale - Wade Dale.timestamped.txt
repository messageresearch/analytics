[18:06] thank God got some young ones coming to
[18:09] man
[18:14] leasing them doing a good job everybody
[18:16] good job Ruth playing the computer
[18:24] rich you're trying to figure out a place
[18:27] to put everybody
[18:29] maybe what if we do like the Opera
[18:32] doesn't we knock the ceiling out and
[18:35] we'll go up to the second level yeah
[18:37] you know it's a good problem to have
[18:40] when we first started going to church
[18:42] here it was hard to find one person to
[18:43] play to even hum I saw much less play
[18:47] much less have to look for a place to
[18:49] put everybody we had a on the old
[18:52] building those of you that were never
[18:54] here but then the door was here two
[18:56] windows were here the pulpit was here
[18:58] seats went this way and the wall was
[19:00] right where brother Larry's that
[19:02] thought about where those flowers are
[19:04] and there was one piano right there and
[19:06] that was it that was it nothing else
[19:10] that was all we just had a had a player
[19:13] had a PN and a few people to play it
[19:16] Joyce was young she played it and then
[19:19] several others didn't come true but
[19:22] thank God we got a we got to find a
[19:24] place to put everybody now and we got a
[19:27] lot of talent sitting back there
[19:29] that could be up here playing so
[19:33] maybe the Lord will work on you not
[19:36] right now though because we got to find
[19:38] places for these first so good to be in
[19:40] the house of the Lord you love the Lord
[19:42] amen so let's get started in the sixth
[19:44] seal part two we're still on the seal
[19:47] which we must see what the seal is I
[19:50] believe the Prophet you know he'd
[19:53] probably read there and preached on the
[19:55] seals for a long time and like we were
[19:58] talking about last night he there's a
[20:01] lot of things he preached
[20:03] but remember what we've been saying
[20:06] brother branham in every seal he had a
[20:09] certain idea and then that idea was
[20:12] changed
[20:13] right but now brother Ram didn't say all
[20:16] right now throw all them other 47 to 63
[20:20] like a lot of people saying the message
[20:21] you know he was so wrong no he didn't
[20:24] have to change all that he just was
[20:26] lining it up more a more perfect
[20:30] way of seeing one gun water baptism
[20:34] marriage in divorce all those things are
[20:36] already in the scripture but it took
[20:37] clarity of their opening of the seals
[20:39] that's why the Bible became a brand-new
[20:41] book because I'm sure there were some
[20:44] things in there that the Prophet had
[20:45] questions about like we have questions
[20:47] about things but when the seals broke I
[20:50] believe the clarity of the message came
[20:52] out from those seals to not change the
[20:56] book heavenly days no didn't change the
[20:58] book and it just gave him more clarity
[21:01] of what he was preaching on and he he
[21:04] knew what he was talking about he said
[21:06] we unless God comes and open these seals
[21:08] were only presuming we'll see we're only
[21:10] presuming until the seals break - you
[21:12] and I amen so we're only presuming and
[21:15] presuming does not get you in the body
[21:17] change no it's got to be a positive
[21:20] everything's got to be positive coming
[21:22] to this body change and then this sixth
[21:24] seal we're looking at then now that
[21:26] we've been looking in the first four
[21:28] seals where there was a bride come there
[21:31] was a
[21:31] an old man died
[21:34] but then you've still got the black dog
[21:36] white dog fight that you got to still
[21:38] fight with which is your spirit realm or
[21:41] your your outside guy not this guy but
[21:44] the middle guy that you got fight with
[21:46] the fight shouldn't be with the inside
[21:48] if the fight still with the inside guy
[21:50] then you need to get born again
[21:52] but if that's settled then let's work on
[21:55] the outside guy we're talking about this
[21:57] morning in the Bible stemming in Sunday
[21:59] school class
[22:00] about
[22:01] milks good
[22:03] but when you're 25 years old you know
[22:06] you don't want to just live on milk
[22:09] you need some meat you need something
[22:11] but now if you've only been given it
[22:13] shut up in a if you've been shut up in a
[22:15] room for 25 years and all they've
[22:17] dunnage somebody hand you milk through a
[22:18] window then that's okay it's a stained
[22:20] you but man it will stunt your growth
[22:22] that's for sure but you ever slide him I
[22:25] tell him what we're dantos and him I'll
[22:28] give him a rib eye State Daniel I swear
[22:30] by my mother to give him a ribeye steak
[22:33] medium-rare with baked potatoes Natalie
[22:35] can't see what he'll do with it he'll
[22:37] take that milk and he'll just move it
[22:38] out of the way and he'll just start
[22:39] eating what eating meat and so that's
[22:42] what
[22:43] we were talking about Paul in Romans
[22:46] therefore he said don't you know don't
[22:48] shun the guy that likes to drink milk in
[22:50] other words paraphrasing but don't stay
[22:53] drinking milk all the time though he
[22:54] looks good but we need some strong meat
[22:56] strong meats what's going to get us out
[22:58] of here so this sixth seal this would be
[23:01] six sealed part two the seal part two so
[23:03] let's go to revelation 6 verse
[23:07] 12 I
[23:10] think brother Lewis for filling in
[23:12] brother Joe and his family are done it
[23:14] at brother Yancy's with brother Matthew
[23:17] break it speaking for them down there so
[23:21] they're on their way back so keep them
[23:23] in your prayers also keep meaning the
[23:25] prayers me and your prayers I finally
[23:27] got I guess I can say this over the
[23:31] Internet I've got a postmaster now
[23:33] that'll let me off so I'm gonna go to
[23:36] the Philippines Lord willing March the
[23:38] 7th through the 19th so and and then I
[23:41] got it takes just a few minutes to go
[23:43] from Keith Reed he wants me there on the
[23:44] 6th
[23:46] in Jamaica so we got to work on that so
[23:50] you just pray we got to pray about that
[23:52] so all right I don't know how that's
[23:54] gonna happen but I don't think it's
[23:57] gonna happen but we'll see what we can
[23:59] do so I'll have to call him back later
[24:01] on this afternoon revelation 6 verse
[24:04] 12 let's bow our heads thank you Lord
[24:07] for another day
[24:08] another time that we can come into this
[24:12] building Lord and just
[24:14] shed off the things of the world just
[24:17] for a few moments Lord and
[24:19] sit back and
[24:21] hear from you Lord
[24:24] not that it's hearing from me Lord
[24:26] they'll be hearing from you father and
[24:29] Lord all things that we've learned all
[24:32] in all these years of
[24:34] studying the Bible and studying the
[24:37] message Lord may they come alive
[24:39] may it not be a dead letter but Lord let
[24:42] it be quickened by the spirit Lord these
[24:46] words are just common words that we use
[24:50] is man and we understand them as human
[24:53] beings and as Americans we speak in
[24:55] English language but Lord your language
[24:58] of the heavenly language it uses that
[25:00] language but Lord is a heavenly language
[25:02] just as you told us through the Prophet
[25:05] that we are prophetic people with
[25:07] prophetic insight that we can hear from
[25:10] you Lord in this time of of the Eagle
[25:13] Age where we've come up now where we're
[25:16] into this sixth seal we're heading
[25:18] toward the seventh seal Lord we're gonna
[25:21] take a little interval before we do but
[25:23] Lord you promised that we would someone
[25:26] stand in the end time and take a body
[25:28] change so we just believe that it's us
[25:32] we just believe that you are here with
[25:36] us among us not just with us but in us
[25:39] and
[25:40] lord I pray that our actions and our
[25:43] movements and know everything that we
[25:44] say today Lord will be pleasing to You
[25:47] Father let it be you speaking and
[25:49] there's no way we can make a mistake if
[25:51] it's you father we were the ones that
[25:53] are sick Lord the ones that are not here
[25:56] be with the ones that are traveling on
[25:58] the highways just bless them Lord
[26:01] be with the missionaries on the foreign
[26:04] fields getting the fruit for their labor
[26:05] father and be with us now as we've had
[26:08] the call there to go to the Philippines
[26:10] Lord that you would that you would grant
[26:13] Lord in our heart we have a desire and
[26:18] you know what that desire is is to help
[26:20] people Lord to grow in grace and
[26:23] knowledge father so we pray that you
[26:24] would anoint that as we take our time to
[26:29] go Lord and let it just be in your will
[26:32] father lets us take care of us lead us
[26:35] and guide us by your Holy Spirit and the
[26:37] bride of Jesus Christ says
[26:39] amen revelation 6 verse 12 and I beheld
[26:43] when he had opened the sick cela now
[26:45] this is John watching something open now
[26:48] remember he watched seal 1 through 4
[26:50] there was writers there was
[26:55] John saw a person get on a horse and now
[26:58] they're gone there's no beast he gets to
[27:01] the fifth seal they're in another
[27:04] dimension that's a group of people
[27:06] that's passed on and they're in they're
[27:07] not on earth they're in another
[27:08] dimension and then here though watch
[27:11] what we're going to do is though we're
[27:12] going to come out of that fifth seal
[27:14] going into the sixth seal we're coming
[27:17] right back to earth we're coming right
[27:19] back into this dimension and what's
[27:21] going to happen on this earth at the
[27:23] time of this opening now remember you
[27:25] and I are not going to be here but you
[27:28] and I must get the spiritual application
[27:30] of what's going on like we were talking
[27:32] in the Bible study and I got it in one
[27:35] of the quotes where we talk about
[27:36] brother Branham says that we the bride
[27:39] goes up in Revelations for one doesn't
[27:41] come back to revelations 19 there's got
[27:43] to be a revelation there you might as
[27:45] well just take four through 1910 the
[27:47] Bible to tear that out of the Bible
[27:48] throw in the trash but you can't because
[27:51] every word is to the bride of Jesus
[27:52] Christ every word is what for your and
[27:55] my admonition to whom the ends of the
[27:58] world become upon so we can't do away
[27:59] with it so then we must understand that
[28:01] it is to a literal person a literal
[28:04] group called Israel but it's also
[28:07] spiritually to you and I so that's what
[28:08] we need to get we're gonna get the seal
[28:10] part first then we're going to get the
[28:11] spiritual application to you and I all
[28:13] right and I beheld when he had opened
[28:15] the sixth seal and lo there was a great
[28:16] earthquake so now that's something gonna
[28:18] happen down here on the earth and the
[28:20] Sun became black as sackcloth of hair
[28:21] and the moon became as blood and the
[28:23] stars of heaven fell into the earth let
[28:26] me say something about the moon turned
[28:27] to blood you know we've had two blood
[28:29] moons and all these things that's okay
[28:30] I'm like Paul we were talking there in
[28:33] Revelations this month I mean in Romans
[28:35] this morning we're policy you know don't
[28:37] in other words don't criticize the
[28:39] people that keep up with dates but I'm
[28:40] just not a date keepers what he was
[28:42] saying basically so same way with me I
[28:44] you know this moon is not a moon we're
[28:47] gonna see
[28:48] now we've seen moons we've seen all
[28:50] these things we've the the Sun went down
[28:53] the middle of day when Jesus died and
[28:56] then we've had black black of the Sun in
[28:59] our day through eclipses that's not what
[29:02] this is this is in the tribulation
[29:05] period this is when we are gone and
[29:07] nature is going to fall because of
[29:10] something we'll talk about a little bit
[29:11] later on but the Sun became black as
[29:14] sackcloth of hair and the moon became as
[29:16] blood and the stars of heaven fell into
[29:19] the earth
[29:20] even as a fig tree casteth her untimely
[29:22] figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind
[29:26] you know there's always that
[29:28] conspiracy theory that there's that's
[29:31] what happened to the flood there was a
[29:33] meteorite hit the earth and caused a
[29:36] flood and now they're saying there's
[29:37] another one that's going to get close
[29:39] and all those things don't worry about
[29:41] that see that takes the worry out of me
[29:44] and you you and I should should not
[29:46] worry about this natural happening if
[29:49] you see this you better worry about it
[29:52] but if you're a bride you won't see this
[29:54] Amen we'll be right over in another
[29:56] faster dimension and let it happen
[29:58] that's okay but you and I as bride are
[30:01] already gone
[30:03] that ought to make you happy
[30:06] amen and the heavens departed as a
[30:09] scroll when
[30:11] it is rolled together
[30:13] Wow and every mountain and Island were
[30:17] moved out of their places and the kings
[30:21] of the earth and the great men and the
[30:23] rich men and chief captains and the
[30:25] mighty men and every bondman and every
[30:26] free man hid themselves in the dens and
[30:29] in the rocks of the mountains and said
[30:31] to the mountains and rocks fall on us
[30:33] and hide us from the face of him that
[30:35] sitteth on the throne they know this is
[30:37] not just a natural occurrence of the
[30:39] earth something is going on and we know
[30:42] what it is we know it's the two prophets
[30:43] over in Israel working this sixth seal
[30:47] from the wrath of the lamb for the great
[30:49] day of his wrath is come and who shall
[30:50] be able to stand you may be seated in
[30:53] the Lord at his blessing to the reading
[30:54] of the word while we put this somebody
[30:56] turn around shake each other's hand say
[30:58] God bless you cuz I got to work to do
[31:00] just me and Danny's got work to do here
[31:04] if you're already done it do it again
[31:06] give up give up a double blessing just
[31:09] turn on shake hands again say god bless
[31:10] you
[31:13] you know brother branham said that's the
[31:15] greatest thing you can say to somebody
[31:17] is God bless you amen
[31:23] now as we start on this let's set the
[31:26] stage and then we'll well let's go ahead
[31:28] and read Matthew 24 we're go and pull
[31:29] that up we'll get that
[31:31] now this is the actual
[31:33] Jesus preaching on the seals see now
[31:36] look it says immediately after the
[31:38] tribulation after the tribulation of
[31:40] these days now we're going to talk about
[31:41] that in just a minute because remember
[31:43] we were talking last night in a Bible
[31:45] study and for those of you who weren't
[31:48] there you should have been there
[31:50] because we had a good time usually if
[31:53] you'll come on Saturday you can sleep
[31:55] through Sunday because that's what we're
[31:57] talking about but y'all don't come on
[31:59] Sunday and you sleep - I mean Saturday
[32:01] you can sleep through Sunday anyway some
[32:03] but tribulation we must look at
[32:05] tribulation and not see that it's the
[32:08] tribulation is going to happen after the
[32:11] bride leaves because you and I are going
[32:14] through a tribulation now I've got it
[32:15] here where
[32:17] it says right here
[32:20] well that I'll just read it the word
[32:25] tribulation means affliction pressure
[32:27] and anguish and a lot of things that we
[32:30] are going through now that we go through
[32:32] tribulation
[32:33] because the Bible says tribulation
[32:35] worketh patience so we're going through
[32:37] tribulation now even even brother
[32:40] Branham calls Israel I read it in the
[32:43] fifth seal that when Israel went through
[32:45] the Aikman and Hitler days of the 6.5
[32:48] million Jews killed that was a minor
[32:50] tribulation so there's been minor
[32:52] tribulations all through
[32:55] all through Christian realm there's been
[32:58] minor tribulations or minor afflictions
[33:00] our minor pressure our anguish so but we
[33:04] know there's a Great Tribulation now
[33:07] this sixth seal is talking about the
[33:09] great the tribulation the wrath of God
[33:11] after you and I leave okay so you have
[33:14] to like we were talking about this
[33:15] morning in Sunday School class you know
[33:17] there's there's resurrection there
[33:20] there's a different kinds of
[33:21] resurrection you can resurrect and
[33:23] somebody died
[33:24] you can resurrect and go into an eternal
[33:27] body I mean a glorified body so you got
[33:29] to watch what you're doing when you talk
[33:30] about these different words basically in
[33:33] the English language when we have so
[33:34] many that mean the same thing so this
[33:36] says in Matthew 24 immediately after the
[33:39] tribulation of those days no see your
[33:41] mind sometimes will go well that's after
[33:43] the tribulation no after the tribulation
[33:46] of these days
[33:48] everybody got that same in the
[33:50] tribulation of these days I'm talking
[33:52] about the days you and I are living in
[33:54] tribulation of those 2000 years those
[33:57] days a thousand years a day two thousand
[33:59] years shall the Sun be darkened and the
[34:02] moon shall not give her light and the
[34:03] stars shall fall from heaven the power
[34:06] 11 shall be shaken and then shall appear
[34:07] the sign of the Son of man in heaven
[34:09] then shall all the tribes of the earth
[34:11] mourn and they shall see the Son of man
[34:13] coming in the clouds of heaven with
[34:15] power and great glory coz see like what
[34:19] we're talking about last night the
[34:22] denominational pretty much all of it not
[34:24] of your now I say denominational world
[34:27] Methodist Baptist I don't know about
[34:30] Presbyterian maybe though they can tell
[34:32] but I know Baptists and Methodists we're
[34:35] going to a seven-year tribulation I
[34:37] don't know about Presbyterian I don't
[34:39] know if they believe that too but most
[34:41] of your major what I say Methodist
[34:43] Baptist know they believe you're gonna
[34:44] go through a tribulation period because
[34:47] of all these different things and then
[34:49] they're gonna see the Son of man coming
[34:50] in the clouds of heaven that's why I
[34:51] told you that brother come one time he
[34:53] told me he said I'll be glad when I see
[34:54] the eastern sky split and Jesus come
[34:57] walking down through the eastern sky I
[34:58] said that's not a secret coming I start
[35:00] to come and I'm wanting if you see that
[35:03] you're in the Tribulation Period
[35:07] amen and then now the devil has got them
[35:11] so confused on the tribulation period
[35:14] that now they're believing you got to go
[35:16] through the tribulation we're brother
[35:19] Branham many times and you read it just
[35:22] put it in tribulation brother around
[35:23] many many many times he said brothers I
[35:25] know you're disagreeing with me because
[35:28] the whole like I said the whole
[35:29] denominational world believes and they
[35:31] seven-year tribulation and when brother
[35:33] Branham comes up and says the bride
[35:35] doesn't go through tribulation well that
[35:37] just blow their doctrine run out the
[35:39] water but you and I though seeing this
[35:42] we know that we can place that we go
[35:44] through
[35:45] minor tribulations ourselves but we
[35:47] never will go through a major three and
[35:50] a half year tribulation and that's what
[35:51] the problem with many people in the
[35:55] message that that doesn't see Daniel 70
[35:58] weeks as as and I've quit saying the way
[36:02] we see it because it's not the way we
[36:03] see it its way the Bible says it is the
[36:05] way the Prophet says it is okay they're
[36:07] saying that we're saying we're going
[36:09] through a seven-year tribulation there's
[36:10] no such thing there's a three and a half
[36:13] year tribulation
[36:15] after we're gone not seven but it's
[36:18] going to take a full week or seven years
[36:20] to finish Daniel seventy weeks ever how
[36:22] God wants to play that last three and a
[36:24] half years out that's his business
[36:26] because we're going to be somewhere else
[36:28] amen but there is one week left after
[36:31] the rapture according to the Bible so I
[36:33] don't need a quote from anybody
[36:36] I'm gonna say that one more time I don't
[36:38] need a quote from anybody the Bible says
[36:41] there's one year left after signing of
[36:43] the treaty with the Antichrist and we
[36:45] are we here when that sign no so there's
[36:49] one week left after the rapture huh and
[36:51] that's you know that's what brother
[36:52] Brown said
[36:53] many many times they just don't
[36:55] understand what he's talking about and
[36:57] he shall send His angels with great
[37:00] sound of a trumpet and they shall gather
[37:01] together his elect from the four winds
[37:03] from one end of heaven to the other all
[37:06] right so see we're all gone here's Jesus
[37:08] preaching the sixth seal so we know
[37:11] what's going to happen and then John
[37:13] picks it up in the book of Revelation
[37:15] and brings it to
[37:17] showing that it's the sixth seal and the
[37:20] sixth seal is gonna open after we leave
[37:23] all right so what we're doing now is is
[37:26] we're going through I want you to be
[37:29] able to see this because it ties in with
[37:33] what we've all been talking about the
[37:35] full plan of redemption that's what
[37:36] brother Branham says I'll read it to you
[37:37] in just a minute the quote where brother
[37:39] Branham talks about the sixth seal
[37:41] covers the whole plan of redemption
[37:43] that's everything everything is covered
[37:45] in these seals every part of redemption
[37:48] is covered in these seals
[37:51] Inchon of the
[37:52] bride
[37:54] redemption of the 144,000 redemption of
[37:58] the fifth seal Jew
[37:59] redemption of the foolish virgin they're
[38:01] all in there somewhere and even now we
[38:04] got to see the redemption of the earth
[38:06] because remember what happened in the
[38:08] Garden of Eden in the Garden of Eden not
[38:10] only did man fall
[38:13] all of nature fell I
[38:17] would and I was looking up the quote
[38:19] when brother Lewis called me out where
[38:21] brother Brown talks about when Adam and
[38:23] Eve going out of the garden the
[38:24] lightning and the thundering sea before
[38:27] it's in happened there was no lightning
[38:29] there was no thunder there was no
[38:30] blackening of the earth of the of the
[38:33] Sun there was no Blood Moon there was no
[38:36] stars falling from the heavens
[38:37] everything was calm
[38:40] all nature was in course with each other
[38:43] then there was no I
[38:46] saw this
[38:48] I'm like dad I read the comic books to
[38:51] get the headlines today there was a
[38:53] comic strip with a little fish a bigger
[38:55] fish with his mouth open the bigger fish
[38:57] with its mouth open the bigger fish with
[38:59] this mouth open the little fish in the
[39:01] middle turn is turning around looking at
[39:03] the fish behind him you know the chain
[39:04] of and he says I want you to know I'm a
[39:08] carry permit holder
[39:12] so anyway but no there was no chain of
[39:15] eating or chain of command before the
[39:18] fall so Nature was exactly the way it's
[39:21] going to be
[39:23] when we get into the millennium and then
[39:25] even into the future home so nature took
[39:28] a tumble not just on the sixth seal
[39:30] nature took a tumble down in the Garden
[39:33] of Eden so the sixth seal we go all the
[39:36] way back to the Garden of Eden to where
[39:38] nature has just tumbled and fell
[39:41] while I mean now Adam has to be careful
[39:45] what part of the woods he walks in when
[39:47] he never did before
[39:49] why because his nature was changed
[39:53] because man had somewhere in man's part
[39:56] of his being had changed now not Adam
[39:59] soul but then the thinking is carnal
[40:01] mind
[40:02] you said well you don't have a carnal
[40:04] mind yeah you do got a carnal mind come
[40:05] on people good grief
[40:08] we do have we still have one but we have
[40:11] the mind of Christ in us that overcomes
[40:13] that every once in a while I said every
[40:16] once in a while alright but we're
[40:18] heading toward the time where it's
[40:19] overtaking more and more I hope we're in
[40:21] that that's the growth development of a
[40:24] Christian I believe is that we know we
[40:26] have a carnal mind but we know how to
[40:28] handle it
[40:30] because if brother Branham says we're
[40:32] going to be sticky till the day the
[40:33] change comes and we're going to have
[40:34] things going through our mind that's not
[40:36] the mind of Christ
[40:38] so just deal with it so I'm telling you
[40:41] just deal with it that's life deal with
[40:43] it all right just don't let it overcome
[40:45] you the things I used to do I don't do
[40:47] them anymore now if you're still doing
[40:48] the things you used to do you need to
[40:49] get morning in that's just pretty simple
[40:52] that's just probably one two three ABCs
[40:54] but for you and I to see that nature is
[40:57] not just that nature is taking a tumble
[41:00] or nature is it's boiling up one time
[41:04] it's already done it one time before I'm
[41:07] sure when Adam and Eve left the Garden
[41:09] of Eden
[41:10] there was never thunder before there was
[41:13] never lightning before there had to be
[41:15] earthquakes they had to be things
[41:17] happened that didn't happen before
[41:19] because when man failed nature fell
[41:22] that's why Romans 8 says the whole world
[41:24] is groaning and waiting for what the
[41:25] manifestation of the sons of God for us
[41:28] to bring nature back because if we fail
[41:30] and Nature has to fall under us then you
[41:33] and I have to come to a place to where
[41:36] we reverse that
[41:39] amen and we've already reversed that in
[41:43] our soul
[41:45] thank God for that people we've already
[41:48] reversed the process in our soul we're
[41:52] sitting in heavenly places we are the
[41:54] nature of God that has been changed but
[41:58] we still got this guy the dual fellow
[42:00] the next guy in the next realm that we
[42:03] got to work with and that's to me what
[42:06] the seals are for that and the Statue of
[42:08] a perfect man they all go hand in hand
[42:10] to work on what your nature
[42:16] your nature of my nature that's what
[42:19] we're sitting here today
[42:21] and I hope you realize that sometime in
[42:24] your life
[42:25] you need to have an experience to where
[42:28] you even say again that thing I used to
[42:31] do I don't do it anymore not sinning I'm
[42:33] talking about
[42:36] you put it you know make you make you
[42:38] whine and draw it and write in whatever
[42:40] you cuz I was telling them downstairs
[42:43] I've got something that bothers me that
[42:44] may don't even may be silly to brother
[42:46] mark
[42:47] but it bothers me so something I got to
[42:50] get rid of but mark may have something
[42:52] that bothers I mean just bothers him to
[42:55] no end I look at him and go come on
[42:57] nobody bothers in it that's the same -
[43:00] you and I are all individuals but you
[43:02] know what the word doesn't bother us
[43:05] it's out in this it's living in this
[43:07] natural nature that's what bothers us
[43:10] because it's all fell
[43:13] you were even born with a fallen nature
[43:16] you were born with a nature contrary to
[43:19] God
[43:20] we were by nature the scripture says the
[43:23] children of what wrath and ready to be
[43:28] destroyed because we came between Satan
[43:31] and Eve in their fallen condition but
[43:34] thank God he's swinging that thing back
[43:36] the other way
[43:38] that's what Redemption is it's not
[43:41] replacement it's if it fell here in the
[43:43] Garden of Eden it's got to come right
[43:45] back up to here amen
[43:48] so the fourth seal we see the bride's
[43:50] taken up so we know we've took a body
[43:53] change somewhere in here right
[43:55] all right there okay
[43:58] take a body change but now what we have
[44:01] to do during that time we must like we
[44:04] were saying before we got a lap back
[44:06] over because we don't get five six and
[44:09] actually none of the seals are to us the
[44:12] natural part of the seal
[44:18] but we must get the actual spiritual
[44:21] application of all of it to get us out
[44:24] of here and to get us out of here it's
[44:26] going to take all of them because who
[44:27] takes a rapture
[44:29] Christ takes the rapture right and he's
[44:32] the Seventh Seal he's coming back after
[44:35] himself he's not coming back after you
[44:37] he's coming back after a piece of him
[44:40] that he gave to you at the new birth
[44:41] he's coming back to get that that's what
[44:43] he's coming for and man he's coming for
[44:45] himself and see if I'm attached to that
[44:49] I got to go
[44:55] you got to go so he's gonna take a
[44:58] rapture
[45:00] he's gonna take a body change you got to
[45:03] make it personal now I'm not gonna make
[45:06] my self change God's you own the one
[45:07] that can change me
[45:09] but he's the one that's going in the
[45:11] rapture
[45:12] right I've accepted what he's gonna do
[45:15] and then I'm gonna just take I'm just
[45:17] gonna fish a free ride
[45:21] that's why why do we struggle
[45:24] you shouldn't struggle shouldn't have
[45:27] fear my brother Dale said you know you
[45:29] come to place brother I'm come to place
[45:30] he said I have no more fear
[45:32] Wow a
[45:34] place to have no more fear
[45:37] well he knew he left he left the guy in
[45:40] the control in the control room have the
[45:42] control likes always supposed to be
[45:44] but let's get back to this so we come
[45:47] back and we just went through seal
[45:48] number five which is the
[45:51] great seal of the Bible showing that a
[45:55] group of people that didn't even want
[45:57] Redemption got redeemed and then but
[46:01] they had to go to a process it wasn't
[46:03] just anything that's not greasy grace
[46:05] greasy grace is just will do what you
[46:07] want to know they had to be a fifth
[46:08] sealed you there had to be a Jew that
[46:11] gave his life for what he believed in
[46:14] under being a Jew not just every Jews
[46:17] gonna be in that fifth seal
[46:19] no no there's some scoundrels is going
[46:22] to be scoundrels and they're gonna come
[46:24] up at the white throne judgment and
[46:25] they're going to be judged as scoundrels
[46:28] so it's just going to be a fifth seal
[46:30] Jews oh that believe who they were and
[46:33] had the testimony they held
[46:37] the testimony they held
[46:40] that's nuts no different in you and I
[46:43] it's the testimony we hold is what's
[46:46] gonna take us in the rapture it's good
[46:49] testimony that we holds what's going to
[46:50] change our body our testimony is we
[46:53] which are alive and remain not we're
[46:55] going to go by the grave we just keep
[46:57] got to keep believing that until we walk
[47:00] into it
[47:01] so the fifth seal is a great seal that
[47:04] give grapes to somebody that didn't even
[47:06] want it now the sixth seal we're coming
[47:09] up to the sixth seal and we're looking
[47:11] at that it's going to be through two
[47:14] prophets and then it's going to be three
[47:17] through two prophets and they're going
[47:19] to call
[47:22] cause all nature to be in their control
[47:26] now the problem with that and Adam when
[47:29] Adam controlled nature it was not
[47:32] falling at that time so the two prophets
[47:36] that's thing about this little while ago
[47:37] the two prophets have to deal with fall
[47:39] in nature
[47:41] to get it to roll back the other
[47:43] direction
[47:44] they're not DC Adam went from he come
[47:47] when God put him on the earth and put
[47:49] him in a human body it was just complete
[47:51] and utter peace I
[47:55] don't believe that there was any thunder
[47:58] and lightning and storms and when there
[47:59] wasn't even any clouds in the sky so the
[48:02] Bible says it was all watered from the
[48:03] ground
[48:04] but when all that other stuff when all
[48:07] the sin happened then what Adam do he
[48:09] lost the control of that
[48:13] so what's the second Adam comes on the
[48:16] earth sure he has control he raises the
[48:20] dead
[48:21] but he also takes fish and makes
[48:24] thousands of fish out of one fish or two
[48:27] fishes five lows he takes and makes
[48:31] thousands of loaves of bread
[48:33] he puts his back foot on the bow of a
[48:35] boat and says peace be still and there's
[48:38] probably a lot of other things that
[48:39] weren't put in the Bible that he did
[48:42] that we don't know anything about but
[48:44] still we know that that he was the he
[48:48] was the master of the sea he was the one
[48:50] that could they could
[48:52] control nature amen and so now that we
[48:57] have that person inside of us but also
[49:00] not just have that person inside of us
[49:02] but have that person inside of us being
[49:05] able to work back with the word that he
[49:07] preached and it be truth because he has
[49:12] the honor of the truth of the word he
[49:14] does not have to honor the false he
[49:17] actually he can under the falls he has
[49:21] the honor what he said so the truth of
[49:24] the word is we're saying now what he
[49:25] said when he said I and my father are
[49:27] one
[49:30] now back down through the denominations
[49:34] they will say I am my father one of the
[49:36] three
[49:39] right one of the three well they got it
[49:43] wrong
[49:44] but now we come up to the end time and
[49:47] we see that now we have the message of
[49:48] the hour that we know that one true and
[49:50] living God is one person one man and
[49:52] that we don't have to deal with all that
[49:55] other
[49:56] that's why to restore by that's that's
[50:00] what we're missing as too weird to be
[50:03] restored back even just to the first
[50:05] church angel but then carry it on
[50:08] further
[50:09] carry it on to the coming of the Lord
[50:12] carry it on to as brother Dale's talking
[50:14] about this is the seventh church age
[50:17] we got some things in there that we got
[50:19] to deal with but right now we're dealing
[50:22] with the seals that we can we can see
[50:24] that there is a listen
[50:27] there was not a chance in
[50:31] the world for Martin Luther to take
[50:34] about a change in the condition and the
[50:38] word he was under he was barred just
[50:41] like Jesus was barred from coming up
[50:43] brother Brown said Jesus when he died he
[50:44] could have come right back out of the
[50:45] grave but he was held by scripture that
[50:48] says he had to be in the earth I told
[50:51] not a total of three but within four
[50:53] three days and three nights right so you
[50:55] and I are held by Scripture the Jews are
[50:57] held by everybody as hell even God
[50:58] Himself is the bound by his own work so
[51:01] being bound by his own word there is a
[51:04] group of people that's going to take a
[51:06] body then there is a group of people
[51:08] that will do that
[51:10] period
[51:11] so why can't we see that you and I can
[51:16] be that because we're in the position
[51:17] doesn't matter how old you are this
[51:20] thing is gonna happen real quick
[51:24] amen I believe it will I believe it'll
[51:27] happen really really fast once once we
[51:31] get out of that interval I want to get
[51:34] to that so much I think we're in that
[51:36] interval I told you there was an
[51:38] interval between 6 & 7 always read your
[51:40] Bible six and seven trumpets six and
[51:42] seven different things sixth and seventh
[51:44] seal there's always six seals stop
[51:46] because remember the property God said
[51:48] six seals finishes Redemption
[51:51] the seventh seal brings him back to the
[51:53] earth all right so we'll get into those
[51:55] quotes a little bit later on but we've
[51:56] got to cover this sixth seal so the
[51:58] sixth seal then is dealing with
[52:01] the earth the
[52:05] natural ball you live on but also it's
[52:09] dealing it has to deal with the earth
[52:12] you're living in
[52:15] because you live in a fallen nature
[52:18] this thing's failed cuz look it's
[52:20] getting older
[52:23] let's agree this is getting older but he
[52:28] doesn't have to
[52:29] and it's not going and finding something
[52:32] to stretch your skin
[52:34] and make you know Michael don't you
[52:36] laugh
[52:38] giving time you're gonna look you look
[52:42] like brother Colley so looking about
[52:43] college sounds like that's what you're
[52:44] gonna look like when you get over them
[52:50] he's fainted
[52:53] but that six heal though is dealing then
[52:56] aren't we've been dealing with a lot of
[52:57] things that v still we're dealing with
[52:59] with something that's six sealed to me
[53:01] is it's an intimate seal
[53:03] intimate seal it's an intimate thing
[53:06] that covers you
[53:07] you right here now I'm sure we're gonna
[53:10] lie if I ever get time I'm gonna talk
[53:13] about the seal but when we get into the
[53:14] spiritual part of it see it's intimate
[53:17] to you because it's something that's
[53:18] gonna happen this ever happened before
[53:20] except to one guy
[53:23] so to me that's intimate
[53:25] it's only gonna happen to the bridegroom
[53:28] and part of the bride and I said part of
[53:31] the bride but now eventually it's gonna
[53:33] be all the bride listen we were turning
[53:35] libeling remain that's going to get a
[53:37] glorified body we were talking about
[53:38] last night
[53:40] the Bible says we which are alive and
[53:42] remain shall not prevent or hinder those
[53:44] which are asleep for the Trump of the
[53:46] godless sound and the dead in Christ
[53:47] shall rise first then we which are alive
[53:50] and remain
[53:51] so see they're going to get out we read
[53:54] a few quotes where brother Brown said
[53:55] they will be changed first
[53:58] alright they're gonna come up in a
[54:00] glorified body they're no come up in
[54:02] their natural body and then be changed
[54:04] come on people they're not gonna come up
[54:06] in their natural body and have brother
[54:08] Branham change their body that's the
[54:10] doctrine folks that's returned ministry
[54:14] doctrine
[54:15] remember the little tent thing where
[54:17] people going through the tent you know
[54:18] and getting healed they're all saying
[54:20] brother Browns got to come back put the
[54:22] tent up he's gonna speak you're
[54:23] glorified body now that's baloney that's
[54:26] hogwash how much effort you want that's
[54:28] a lie
[54:29] Jesus Christ is the only ones gonna
[54:31] change your body here William Branham is
[54:34] depending on us to take his message
[54:37] quicken his message in this dimension to
[54:41] get him out of that dimension he cannot
[54:43] do us any good in another dimension
[54:47] he cannot
[54:54] but boy what he preached in this
[54:56] dimension let's get it we gotta get it
[55:00] first he'd give it to us he handed it to
[55:04] a bride a mini membered body for us to
[55:08] get what he's talking about
[55:11] what about a man greatest ministry in
[55:14] the world same way with Jesus and at the
[55:17] end of his ministry he had nobody around
[55:19] him and nobody understood him
[55:22] remember Jesus did go to the upper room
[55:24] and tarry till you receive power from on
[55:27] high they had no power but when the Holy
[55:29] Ghost came he give them power same way
[55:32] brother Branham I believe when he was
[55:33] talking on the questions and answers on
[55:35] the seals he said you're not getting it
[55:37] it's not for you ma'am we've already
[55:39] read this not for that group of people
[55:40] he was preaching to a group of people
[55:42] that would not come to what he was
[55:44] talking about
[55:45] but he knew there was a group coming
[55:47] because the Bible says we which are
[55:50] alive and remain well we are we
[55:53] until we pass away we are away we which
[55:57] are alive and remain shall not prevent
[56:00] or hinder those which are asleep
[56:03] for the dead in Christ shall rise first
[56:07] but there's got to be something go on in
[56:10] our nature no not our not our soul
[56:15] our soul just as eternal as God is
[56:18] it's not as eternal as God is it is God
[56:22] it's a peace of God it is they what it
[56:25] is the last and morphe of God - the
[56:27] Gentile church so it's God made manifest
[56:30] in human flesh called put your name in
[56:34] there all right so that nature is what
[56:37] I'm dealing with I've got to deal with
[56:39] mine you got to deal with yours as we
[56:40] were talking about this morning brother
[56:41] Dale's not gonna change your body
[56:43] there's not gonna be a laying on of
[56:45] hands to change your body no it's gonna
[56:49] be the preaching of the word it's gonna
[56:51] be the quickening that you have in your
[56:53] heart not collective
[56:56] it's gonna be individual some here some
[56:59] there some asleep some not
[57:06] maybe we want to give pens that's what
[57:09] we need when you appeal
[57:11] poke your neighbor
[57:13] poke your neighbor and wake them up if
[57:16] you don't have a neighbor and you're in
[57:17] trouble
[57:19] but this to me this is life to me this
[57:22] is heading toward to me this is the
[57:25] honing down this is the part that we
[57:27] come into that if you miss it you just
[57:30] miss it
[57:32] you just miss it and it's not whose
[57:34] fault your fault my fault we can't pour
[57:38] it down your throat
[57:39] that's why I said this sick seal to me
[57:42] is the most intimate seal you still know
[57:45] the intimate seals getting born-again
[57:47] you got to get born again but getting
[57:49] born again is a piece of the puzzle
[57:53] this guy's not born again but there's a
[57:56] promise that this guy can be born again
[57:58] there's a promise there's a message
[58:01] there's 1,100 sermons to somebody that
[58:04] this guy right here is going to be
[58:06] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[58:08] an eye
[58:09] promised by God
[58:12] and if he promised it he's going to have
[58:15] to make it come to pass he will have to
[58:18] make it come to pass you say wait you
[58:20] know what we do we go with our West here
[58:22] we go with our list I can't do this I
[58:25] can't do that I what that's what was
[58:27] Moses his problem he said I can't even
[58:31] talk
[58:32] God said don't got your brother standing
[58:35] beside you he can do the talking for you
[58:36] all right same way with us with them I
[58:39] we can't talk we can't share the message
[58:41] with now don't worry about it
[58:43] don't worry about it let God work in
[58:47] your life that's the whole thing I you
[58:50] know because when I want you to when I
[58:53] want you to say I am I don't want you to
[58:55] see I don't want you to see that it's
[58:58] that I'm gonna do it it's the I am when
[59:01] you say that word I am to Christian we
[59:05] know who that is that's not you that
[59:07] wasn't Moses that wasn't even the
[59:10] burning bush the burning bush wasn't the
[59:11] I am the burning bush was a cover
[59:15] to cover the I am because Moses couldn't
[59:19] see him that okay but now you and I
[59:22] don't have a burning bush sure we have a
[59:25] burning bush experience but we see the
[59:27] man
[59:29] inside that bush called the I am and
[59:32] then the I am listen as great as Moses
[59:35] was
[59:36] see to me this is the whole seventh seal
[59:39] though the Rideau Moses was the greatest
[59:43] man to walk on the face of the earth
[59:45] during that time beside Jesus Christ but
[59:47] he wasn't Jesus Christ and he wasn't a
[59:49] bride
[59:52] he did not have God dwelling in his soul
[59:55] as a new birth as a believer as a bride
[1:00:00] he did not have that he had an anointing
[1:00:04] on him
[1:00:06] not in him
[1:00:08] you do come on and you have enough word
[1:00:13] to make you come to pass Moses was
[1:00:15] making his own word as he went now I
[1:00:18] don't mean that you understand what I'm
[1:00:19] saying if you say well he's making it up
[1:00:21] as you went night in savings making it
[1:00:23] up he was writing the Bible as he went
[1:00:26] my brother down with somebody he was
[1:00:28] present what he was doing he was writing
[1:00:31] at one time Moses died well sure he
[1:00:34] wrote about it before but there was a
[1:00:36] time when he stepped into that
[1:00:37] same way with you and I it's become
[1:00:40] prophecy until you and I step into that
[1:00:42] prophecy and see what happens in this
[1:00:45] sixth seal there's two prophets step
[1:00:48] into that prophecy that we're going to
[1:00:50] read in a minute about revelations 11 or
[1:00:52] 7 that's a that 11 where the two
[1:00:56] prophets come they've got to step into
[1:00:58] that well now you and I though are
[1:01:00] already left so we've already stepped
[1:01:03] into what we which are alive and remain
[1:01:04] but we've got to come to a place of
[1:01:06] total sanctification where our nature
[1:01:10] has changed you say well we got a nature
[1:01:13] change when we born again yes we did but
[1:01:15] we still have problems memory reasons
[1:01:18] and conscious how many times have we
[1:01:20] said this
[1:01:21] memory reason conscious affection
[1:01:23] imagination that's our problem
[1:01:25] not the inside God right it's that
[1:01:29] middle man that's what these sales were
[1:01:32] for it's the middle man I don't think
[1:01:36] I've said it that hard but that inside
[1:01:38] man can get born again and never hear
[1:01:41] about the seals
[1:01:44] Paul never heard about him did he
[1:01:47] Peter never heard the seal one two three
[1:01:50] four five six seven sure they heard it
[1:01:52] in Matthew when Jesus preached it did
[1:01:54] they understand it they
[1:01:56] didn't understand a word he was saying
[1:02:01] come through all that body change come
[1:02:05] through all that getting the grave come
[1:02:07] through all that and right before he
[1:02:09] goes up
[1:02:10] the milk drinkers in the crowd
[1:02:14] are you going to restore the kingdom now
[1:02:17] right you know what they said are you
[1:02:20] gonna restore the kingdom now and he
[1:02:23] probably went
[1:02:26] wait for 11 more days
[1:02:29] wait for the damn Pentecost when that
[1:02:31] damn Pentecost comes I'll be able to
[1:02:34] tell you what I'm talking about because
[1:02:37] I'll be in you doing the talking but at
[1:02:41] the time he was standing there all that
[1:02:43] like I'm telling you all that great
[1:02:44] thing they thought he would come to take
[1:02:46] over they thought he'd come to conquer
[1:02:48] you know Roman you know all these people
[1:02:50] they just thump him out of Israel look
[1:02:53] what happened after he left
[1:02:57] they destroyed that place time has
[1:03:01] totally wiped off the map so it wasn't
[1:03:04] that Jesus was going to restore that
[1:03:06] Kingdom he's restoring a heavenly
[1:03:09] kingdom a
[1:03:11] secret kingdom and that's what you and I
[1:03:14] live we live in a secret world
[1:03:19] well you better live in a secret world
[1:03:21] because if you don't you living in the
[1:03:23] world where the devil's got control of
[1:03:24] what you're doing
[1:03:26] what brother Brown say brother Brown
[1:03:28] said if I speak it the devil can do
[1:03:30] something with it he said but if I hold
[1:03:32] it in my heart
[1:03:33] he can't do anything with him
[1:03:36] hold this message what didn't Mary hold
[1:03:39] that message in your heart and
[1:03:41] let God work on it hold that message
[1:03:44] that's why I said this sixth seal to me
[1:03:46] is an intimate seal it's you say well
[1:03:49] what about still 1 through 4 yes but
[1:03:51] like I said before how its intimate that
[1:03:54] God can live in your soul
[1:03:56] we think it's an impossibility that he
[1:03:59] can live in your spirit and definitely
[1:04:02] he's not gonna live in your flesh now
[1:04:04] come on people we've had this hard thing
[1:04:07] in our brain that we can't do this
[1:04:10] that's why we go ask why we put his
[1:04:13] sister in the ground a few days ago when
[1:04:16] we put people in the ground
[1:04:19] but there's a group of people that's
[1:04:23] going to take such a nature change so
[1:04:25] it's going to change the whole person
[1:04:28] if I don't get to this one I'm gonna get
[1:04:30] the rest of it done let's let's go back
[1:04:31] to let's go to the fifth seal I've give
[1:04:33] you a little bit of background so I can
[1:04:35] read this real quick we got communion
[1:04:37] today too so
[1:04:39] notice we come to this fifth seal now
[1:04:42] there's no writer goes forth and there's
[1:04:44] no beast to announce it the lamb opened
[1:04:47] it and John saw it there was no one
[1:04:49] there to say now come look and see no
[1:04:51] power of the living creature are there
[1:04:54] on the sixth seal there's no beast to
[1:04:55] announce it it was just what John saw
[1:04:58] all right and on the seventh seal
[1:05:01] there's no beasts to announce that no
[1:05:03] power to announce that no one doesn't on
[1:05:05] the look after the fourth seal there's
[1:05:07] no announcement by any beast power from
[1:05:09] the fifth sixth or seventh not at all so
[1:05:11] I'm saying it's become intimate
[1:05:13] it's become God hiding himself in
[1:05:16] simplicity he's hid himself in a group
[1:05:20] of people that the seals were gonna be
[1:05:22] able to open to you to me that's
[1:05:25] intimate that's why you're a special
[1:05:27] group of people that's why you're
[1:05:28] prophetic people all the people with
[1:05:30] prophetic insight you'll me read all
[1:05:31] that to you if you've been reading your
[1:05:32] church age book is in the first few
[1:05:34] pages
[1:05:35] right first part of that lesson that's
[1:05:39] us we're an intimate people we are we
[1:05:41] have an intimate relationship with
[1:05:43] Christ sure every Christian does but
[1:05:45] listen he wants more
[1:05:48] he wants more he wants more of
[1:05:51] relationship listen here
[1:05:54] I'll cover that later I'm not gonna
[1:05:56] cover it now talk about Adam in the
[1:05:58] garden we'll talk about Adam and garnet
[1:05:59] later because remember even Adam in the
[1:06:01] garden was not exactly the total way God
[1:06:03] wanted to deal with with man
[1:06:07] even though Adam had complete control
[1:06:10] over everything
[1:06:13] brother Brown said his body was being
[1:06:16] renewed it was not eternal
[1:06:19] God wants you to walk in an eternal body
[1:06:23] because he's in an eternal body he came
[1:06:26] down here in a flesh body so that we can
[1:06:28] live and eat it in an eternal body
[1:06:32] what a mighty God
[1:06:34] alright let's look at number two
[1:06:38] back to the sixth seal now earthquake
[1:06:41] let us compare scripture got pencils and
[1:06:44] paper I want you to do something for me
[1:06:45] if you want to write this down unless
[1:06:47] you're gonna take the tape now I want
[1:06:49] you to read this I want you to read with
[1:06:52] me as we as you do compare scripture of
[1:06:56] this great event that will see that this
[1:06:57] great secret of mystery that was under
[1:06:59] the sixth seal of the book of Redemption
[1:07:01] I just want to keep getting that in your
[1:07:02] mind because sometimes we say all right
[1:07:04] this is Redemption Redemption and all of
[1:07:06] a sudden something wanders off in your
[1:07:09] mind well what's this got to do with
[1:07:11] Redemption
[1:07:12] all six seals brother man says six seals
[1:07:15] finishes Redemption because the seventh
[1:07:17] seal there's nothing redeemable in the
[1:07:18] seventh seal
[1:07:20] that's Christ himself
[1:07:25] pretty simple that's why they silence in
[1:07:27] heaven for half an hour now
[1:07:29] remember these are hidden mysteries in
[1:07:31] the sixth seal altogether is one great
[1:07:33] big book just sits Scrolls roll together
[1:07:36] because if six seals finishes Redemption
[1:07:39] there's really not a seventh seal in the
[1:07:41] Bible
[1:07:43] the whole Bible is the seventh seat
[1:07:46] right but this what says I remember
[1:07:49] these are hidden mysteries the six seals
[1:07:51] altogether is one great big book he
[1:07:54] doesn't say seventh he says six because
[1:07:57] the six seals finishes Redemption that's
[1:08:00] why we don't need the Bible any more
[1:08:02] physical Bible once we're totally
[1:08:06] redeemed once you're totally redeems you
[1:08:09] don't need to carry Bible realm with you
[1:08:10] you are the Bible you are every
[1:08:12] scripture you are every person you are
[1:08:15] every manifestation of God for your day
[1:08:17] and agen for your time all right
[1:08:21] who believes that
[1:08:24] who believes that
[1:08:26] you know what some of your sitting here
[1:08:29] and didn't raise your hand and these
[1:08:30] three kids in the back raising their
[1:08:31] hand just
[1:08:36] six girls to get unwinds the whole book
[1:08:40] of Redemption so when six see it listen
[1:08:42] when six seals are revealed you're
[1:08:45] redeemed
[1:08:47] when six that we're all waiting for that
[1:08:49] seventh we're waiting for the seventh
[1:08:51] the seventh is open that's not open
[1:08:52] whatever you want to do let's continue
[1:08:55] with the six because six seals finishes
[1:08:58] redemption if you do that automatically
[1:09:01] the seventh is there in manifestation
[1:09:06] that okay with that it unwinds the whole
[1:09:10] book of redemption that's how the whole
[1:09:12] earth
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:14] now take your finger and do this
[1:09:17] this is the earth we're talking about
[1:09:19] that's the earth he's talking about but
[1:09:21] once we do that the whole world's gonna
[1:09:25] be redeemed listen we're not gonna come
[1:09:27] back now we will in the Millennium be
[1:09:29] careful we will in the Millennium not
[1:09:31] come back to a redeemed entire earth
[1:09:34] everybody do this
[1:09:37] devil still alive his demons are still
[1:09:40] alive there's a lot of things we got to
[1:09:42] deal with in the Millennium because
[1:09:43] remember the Millennium is to the Jews
[1:09:45] there's a thousand years of rain ar e
[1:09:49] IG n thank you Jim she's kept graced me
[1:09:53] with my spelling she helps me the the
[1:09:56] rain on end the millennium is to the
[1:09:58] Jews for a thousand years the son of
[1:10:01] David we've already covered all that not
[1:10:03] until the future home brother branham
[1:10:05] said that future home now sits on a
[1:10:08] redeemed entire earth but you and I have
[1:10:13] to have the redeemed entire earth to
[1:10:15] begin with this earth for that Earth to
[1:10:18] come this way listen when we leave this
[1:10:22] place
[1:10:23] it's called the wrath of God for a
[1:10:26] purpose
[1:10:27] because who's holding back the wrath of
[1:10:30] God this world is doomed
[1:10:34] this earth is doomed listen if we don't
[1:10:37] get a body change this earth is doomed
[1:10:40] cuz it's going to go to a grave
[1:10:43] but thanks be to God we know by opening
[1:10:47] of the seal that you and I are already
[1:10:49] redeemed we just got to come back
[1:10:52] through the process of bringing this guy
[1:10:54] back but those who are alive and remain
[1:10:56] don't have to go back through that we
[1:10:59] get it right here alright hey listen
[1:11:03] even Jesus had to go into another
[1:11:04] dimension and come back and pick up his
[1:11:07] body to make you glorified he had a
[1:11:10] process he had to go through that's why
[1:11:12] you and I this is still a process we
[1:11:15] have to go through we have to see that
[1:11:18] the fifth seal is the seal of grace to
[1:11:22] you the sixth seal is a changing of the
[1:11:25] whole natural world but it's a changing
[1:11:27] of your nature that we'll get into maybe
[1:11:30] a little bit later on but let's finish
[1:11:32] this steel part now let's go to
[1:11:38] number three
[1:11:40] now what is this sixth seal the sixth
[1:11:43] seal is the Tribulation Period and let
[1:11:46] me read again what the meaning of
[1:11:48] tribulation is that very meaning of that
[1:11:50] word in the Bible where it says we go
[1:11:53] through tribulation is
[1:11:55] affliction pressure or anguish now what
[1:11:59] takes place the bride has gone there's
[1:12:03] no living creature nothing there to say
[1:12:05] it now everybody understand when we talk
[1:12:06] about living creature we're talking
[1:12:07] about the Holy Ghost we're talking about
[1:12:09] the lying ox man in the Eagle we're
[1:12:11] talking about the Holy Ghost inside of
[1:12:14] you listen when we leave this earth
[1:12:17] when we leave this earth
[1:12:20] at a moment's time there's nothing to be
[1:12:23] any Holy Ghost except in two prophets in
[1:12:26] the whole world
[1:12:28] Loui whole world only two people are
[1:12:33] going to have the Holy Ghost now there's
[1:12:35] 144,000 coming but it looks so dark and
[1:12:39] so weak but that's the greatest time
[1:12:41] ever
[1:12:42] because we're already gone
[1:12:44] we've already took a body change we're
[1:12:46] already out of here
[1:12:48] is not dealing with the church anymore
[1:12:50] it's been gone he's dealing with Israel
[1:12:54] see see this is the other side this is
[1:12:57] when Israel receives the message of the
[1:12:59] kingdom by the two prophets of
[1:13:01] revelations 11 remember Israel is a
[1:13:04] nation God's servant nation and when
[1:13:07] when when Israel is brought in it'll be
[1:13:09] a national affair
[1:13:11] Israel the kingdom age is where David
[1:13:13] the son of David sits on the throne see
[1:13:16] the 144,000 got to come together
[1:13:19] accept the message of the hour
[1:13:22] be killed take a rapture and then they
[1:13:27] got to come back and build a Millennium
[1:13:28] temple and be the servants of that
[1:13:32] temple and then you and I come into that
[1:13:34] temple we know that's explained in
[1:13:36] Daniel 70 weeks but Israel must receive
[1:13:39] the message of the two prophets before
[1:13:44] the son of David can sit on the throne
[1:13:47] so there's still a process to go through
[1:13:49] everybody with me say Amen
[1:13:52] to get the son of David on the throne
[1:13:54] that's for Israel not for us we're in a
[1:13:58] wedding supper we're somewhere else
[1:14:00] we're on our honeymoon we're actually
[1:14:02] having an extended honeymoon that
[1:14:04] continues another thousand years when we
[1:14:06] get down there amen they're all right
[1:14:09] but we are nations we are individuals
[1:14:12] you and I have to come to the Statue of
[1:14:15] a perfect man and all these other things
[1:14:17] as an individual so it's not a church
[1:14:26] it's an individual
[1:14:28] all right let's do number four real
[1:14:31] quick
[1:14:32] excuse me
[1:14:40] and I beheld when he opened the sixth
[1:14:42] seal that was a great earthquake then
[1:14:44] all nature was interrupted see God's
[1:14:45] been doing great things like healing the
[1:14:47] sick opening on the block eyes of the
[1:14:50] blind doing great things he's doing that
[1:14:51] now hey man but we find out here that
[1:14:55] nature took a tumble yes all nature look
[1:14:58] what taking place the earthquake the Sun
[1:15:01] went black the moon wouldn't give its
[1:15:03] light the Stars shook and fell and why
[1:15:06] everything happened see right at the
[1:15:08] time of the opening of this sixth seal
[1:15:11] that's when it takes place right
[1:15:13] immediately after the announcing of
[1:15:15] those martyrs right here the martyrs
[1:15:17] this sealed you martyrs see the martyrs
[1:15:21] had been finished all right now let's go
[1:15:24] to number four
[1:15:26] no I'm sorry number five sorry
[1:15:30] so if Nate now look if nature took a
[1:15:33] tumble then it's got to come back to the
[1:15:36] other way so what we're talking about a
[1:15:38] few minutes ago nature's got to come
[1:15:40] back
[1:15:41] hey man we don't know what this world
[1:15:44] looked like before the before the flood
[1:15:46] but boy after the flood we know what it
[1:15:48] looks like but before the flood we don't
[1:15:50] but we're going to because we're gonna
[1:15:51] see it not in the Millenium I
[1:15:54] just don't believe in the millennium
[1:15:56] everything's going to be changed and
[1:15:57] then it's gonna stay that way no because
[1:16:00] remember in the millennium at the Battle
[1:16:03] of Armageddon over here is going to be
[1:16:05] an atomic war
[1:16:07] we'll cover that because it says that
[1:16:10] your skin will fall off of your body
[1:16:12] while you're standing and that's an
[1:16:13] atomic nuclear war and it's gonna take a
[1:16:17] while for everybody to die mmm that's
[1:16:19] just the way I see it I see it that a
[1:16:21] millennium we can come back and we can
[1:16:22] see this building right here if it had
[1:16:23] been completely down
[1:16:25] because it's not always it's not all the
[1:16:28] way brought back again but now the
[1:16:30] future home why do we go up on the
[1:16:32] breadth of the earth if God's not fixing
[1:16:34] to let this thing go he'll really stay
[1:16:37] brother Ram said they're really being
[1:16:38] noise then when he takes and then he
[1:16:40] destroys all this Devils puts the earth
[1:16:42] right back to the way it was in the
[1:16:45] Garden of Eden that's just the way I see
[1:16:46] it and then we'll come down on a
[1:16:48] redeemed entire earth nothing will have
[1:16:50] to be changed but in the Millennium
[1:16:52] things are gonna have to be changed
[1:16:53] because that temples not the place we're
[1:16:55] living
[1:16:56] that's not our living quarters that's
[1:16:59] not the future home in the Millennium
[1:17:01] our future home comes after the thousand
[1:17:04] years so this is all going to be
[1:17:05] destroyed again
[1:17:08] we've covered that many many times what
[1:17:10] not have to
[1:17:12] look cross-eyed
[1:17:14] to see it
[1:17:17] because remember the Millennium is a
[1:17:20] space of time
[1:17:22] we are still in time in the Millennium I
[1:17:25] just agree with that
[1:17:29] shake your head if you agree that's time
[1:17:32] time and eternity is two different
[1:17:34] things
[1:17:35] now we're eternal and we can live in
[1:17:38] time but we can't have an eternal future
[1:17:41] home in the Millennium you know what
[1:17:44] happened we got to go through the
[1:17:46] thousand years man's got to live a
[1:17:47] thousand years
[1:17:48] right then the millennium is gonna end
[1:17:53] then the white throne judgment then
[1:17:55] we're gonna take and go into the future
[1:17:58] home where everything is laid out
[1:17:59] exactly by your desire
[1:18:04] we in the millennium it's not our desire
[1:18:07] its Israel son of David
[1:18:12] we're just down we're allowing a
[1:18:15] vacation like like you know you take and
[1:18:17] go to Alaska or somewhere well you know
[1:18:19] what then people live there you're there
[1:18:20] just on the vacation that's not your
[1:18:23] home
[1:18:28] see that even helps when we the song
[1:18:31] came to my mind this world is not my
[1:18:33] home I'm just a passenger well no that's
[1:18:36] not true
[1:18:39] that's not true according to them it is
[1:18:42] yeah but according to my revelation this
[1:18:44] is my home now the very state of it
[1:18:47] being right now is not my home but it is
[1:18:49] my home this is where I'm gonna live cuz
[1:18:52] you know what when brother Brent
[1:18:53] preaches the future home he destroyed
[1:18:54] another old doctrine that the
[1:18:56] denominations have that we're all going
[1:18:58] to what
[1:18:59] heaven we're all going to level the
[1:19:02] clouds where I want to we're coming
[1:19:04] right back here
[1:19:06] God's gonna just wipe it off and we're
[1:19:09] gonna come right back down on top of it
[1:19:10] hey man where we know the sixth seal is
[1:19:13] the judgement seal
[1:19:14] so now remember word is brother branham
[1:19:18] say judgment starts at the house of God
[1:19:21] so our judgment seal is right here this
[1:19:24] one said this is going to be intimate
[1:19:26] every time you walk in the door the
[1:19:29] sixth seal has to open need because if
[1:19:34] you're born again God's not trying to
[1:19:35] change you're born again
[1:19:39] he's trying to change the next guy
[1:19:42] the guy that when you go outside and
[1:19:45] somebody cut you off on the highway
[1:19:46] hello oh that doesn't happen y'all
[1:19:49] anymore okay
[1:19:52] I
[1:19:57] just let you sit there and think about
[1:19:59] that for a minute
[1:20:04] good to see you but we know that next
[1:20:06] six seal is the judgment seal
[1:20:09] because what is our final judgment
[1:20:13] even our final judgment is we were
[1:20:15] talking about this morning the bride has
[1:20:17] the final judgment I
[1:20:20] read it in Romans this morning of the
[1:20:23] deeds done in the body whether good or
[1:20:24] bad we're going to give an account of
[1:20:25] what we do in this body that we have
[1:20:29] so said the Bible
[1:20:32] but like brother Brown says you either
[1:20:34] gonna get rid of it here and not have to
[1:20:36] deal with it later are you gonna keep it
[1:20:38] here and you got to deal with it later
[1:20:39] all right so why can't we come to the
[1:20:42] judgment seat of God
[1:20:44] and get rid of it
[1:20:48] brother Brown says you either get what
[1:20:50] better or worse when you ly6 steal folks
[1:20:54] six seal I just got that myself just now
[1:20:56] six seal this is the judgment house you
[1:20:59] either get rid of it or you keep it with
[1:21:01] you when you walk out that door it's
[1:21:05] the judgment steal exactly now we've had
[1:21:07] the Antichrist ride seeing the church go
[1:21:10] now it's finished goes up then we see
[1:21:12] the martyrs with them Jews back there
[1:21:13] under the altar that's the fifth seal
[1:21:15] now here's the breaking fourth of the
[1:21:17] judgment upon the people
[1:21:19] we're out of this tribulation judgment
[1:21:21] will come forth the
[1:21:23] 144,000 redeemed Jews I'll prove that
[1:21:27] they are Jews and not Gentiles they have
[1:21:29] nothing to do with the bride not one
[1:21:32] thing the bride we done seen the bride
[1:21:34] leave
[1:21:36] all right so we don't go to any
[1:21:38] tribulation right here we can't place
[1:21:41] that anywhere else don't come back again
[1:21:43] until the nineteenth chapter well he
[1:21:45] says the book of Acts we know we meant
[1:21:46] the book of Revelation everybody okay
[1:21:49] with that say man okay I don't want to
[1:21:51] get hung up with that that's the book of
[1:21:53] Revelation now notice for the sixth seal
[1:21:56] is the judgment seal of the word
[1:22:00] he changed we didn't change it he just
[1:22:03] brought more revelation he said to
[1:22:04] judgment seal the earth or the judgment
[1:22:07] seal of all nature now he's bringing the
[1:22:09] judgment seal of the word and see that's
[1:22:13] what makes it so intimate because we're
[1:22:15] supposed to be Word people we're
[1:22:17] supposed to be a word born bride I say
[1:22:19] we are I don't say we're supposed to be
[1:22:21] we are one
[1:22:23] hey man
[1:22:25] we good with this that all right let's
[1:22:29] read this one and then we'll finish
[1:22:32] let's go to revelations 11 because this
[1:22:34] is the seal brother Brown said those two
[1:22:36] prophets are the sixth seal right all
[1:22:39] right and that was giving me a reed like
[1:22:42] unto a rod the angel stood saying rise
[1:22:44] and measure the temple of God and the
[1:22:46] altar and them that worship therein but
[1:22:48] the court which is without the temple
[1:22:49] without the temple leave out and measure
[1:22:51] it not for it is given unto the Gentiles
[1:22:53] remember the Gentiles can go in the
[1:22:55] outer court and the Holy City shall they
[1:22:57] tread under foot foot forty and two
[1:23:00] months
[1:23:02] how long is that
[1:23:07] twelve months times three is thirty six
[1:23:10] and six more is what 42 alright so here
[1:23:14] we go now that's not 42 of our months
[1:23:18] that's 42 prophetic months of 30 days
[1:23:22] because
[1:23:22] you can't make it fit with a thousand
[1:23:25] two hundred and threescore you can't fit
[1:23:28] 1260 days into our three and a half year
[1:23:31] calendar
[1:23:32] it won't fit because there's 28 days in
[1:23:34] this month we're in now 31 in January 30
[1:23:37] in March you see what I mean back and
[1:23:39] forth but they're going to prophesy for
[1:23:43] 1,260 days two witnesses clothed in
[1:23:47] sackcloth now look at that word they
[1:23:49] shall prophesy
[1:23:53] you keep these things in mind because
[1:23:55] you're going to remember we're gonna pop
[1:23:56] up one day and preach the sermon on what
[1:23:58] same claim brother Dale preached on one
[1:24:00] time those who prophesy must die because
[1:24:04] remember what you're doing you're
[1:24:05] prophesying you're doing this
[1:24:10] what are you saying there's coming a
[1:24:13] group of people right
[1:24:14] there's coming a group of people
[1:24:18] well that's not you
[1:24:21] you're prophesying of a group to come
[1:24:25] but we need to be prophetic people to
[1:24:29] understand what the prophets saying and
[1:24:32] have prophetic insight but not have
[1:24:37] prophecy
[1:24:38] or
[1:24:40] prophesy of another group to come that's
[1:24:42] been our problem
[1:24:46] who in the world have heard
[1:24:49] back when you were in denomination
[1:24:53] well we're not gonna see it in our day
[1:24:56] but we know the Lord's coming
[1:25:00] they keep doing what they keep what
[1:25:02] prophesy a group is coming
[1:25:05] well they're gonna run up against the
[1:25:07] wall somewhere they got to cuz there has
[1:25:09] got to be a group well it's not our day
[1:25:11] now we're not gonna see that but now
[1:25:13] maybe somebody else will see that what
[1:25:15] are they doing they're saying we don't
[1:25:16] have enough to get us there and you know
[1:25:19] what they're saying they're prophesying
[1:25:20] their self out of that group
[1:25:23] even brother Branham
[1:25:26] he was the Prophet he prophesied of a
[1:25:30] group to come don't throw anything
[1:25:33] please I'm old
[1:25:35] but those who prophesy must die he
[1:25:38] prophesied of a group of people coming
[1:25:40] the Bible is full of prophecies about
[1:25:43] what about a group of people to come so
[1:25:46] then all the other ones are what passed
[1:25:48] on because they're not that group but
[1:25:51] why can't we say
[1:25:53] we're that group that the whole Bible's
[1:25:57] talking about
[1:26:00] because remember they're gonna
[1:26:01] prophesied and then they're gonna die
[1:26:05] huh hello
[1:26:08] those are the two olive trees and to
[1:26:11] count sticks standing before the god of
[1:26:12] the earth now we know what happens they
[1:26:14] have power to shut heaven they have
[1:26:16] power to water turn it to blood smite
[1:26:19] the earth with all plagues as often as
[1:26:21] they will
[1:26:22] something's going on here and when they
[1:26:25] finished their testimony verses let's go
[1:26:27] to verse 7 the Beast that ascends out of
[1:26:30] the bottomless pit shall make war
[1:26:31] against them and shall overcome them and
[1:26:33] kill them remember just like I told
[1:26:36] everybody the other day I think I
[1:26:39] mentioned that here we were talking
[1:26:40] outside
[1:26:42] you got God is is in continuity what he
[1:26:46] does he pretty much does because what he
[1:26:49] done when he came to earth when he came
[1:26:51] to earth for three and a half years they
[1:26:53] tried to kill it man but he had to get a
[1:26:57] message out even he prophesied so he had
[1:27:00] to die
[1:27:02] hello right
[1:27:05] he prophesy he was a prophet he had to
[1:27:08] die
[1:27:09] cuz he was what talking to me and you he
[1:27:13] was speaking of her people
[1:27:14] right but when that anointing came on
[1:27:17] Jesus on the River Jordan for three and
[1:27:19] a half years they tried to kill him
[1:27:20] couldn't kill him
[1:27:21] it left him in the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:27:23] he died
[1:27:27] brother Branham let's take it to this
[1:27:30] time now brother Branham three and a
[1:27:31] half year when this the seals open there
[1:27:33] was an anointing that came down
[1:27:35] that there was nothing can happen to
[1:27:37] that prophet till he finished his
[1:27:38] message then when that lifted off of him
[1:27:41] 1965 he passed away
[1:27:45] I'm telling you the bride of Jesus
[1:27:47] Christ has got to have that same
[1:27:49] anointing because that's the anointing
[1:27:50] of the headstone of the message of the
[1:27:52] hour that when that anointing comes on
[1:27:54] us
[1:27:56] we can't die
[1:27:58] but we got to keep that anointing here
[1:28:01] and we're commission too but those
[1:28:06] didn't what does that brother Brown say
[1:28:08] the spirit that was on us lifts off of
[1:28:10] us I'll bring you the quote later lifts
[1:28:13] off of us and goes where the
[1:28:16] Israel it anoints them for how long
[1:28:20] three and a half years the same
[1:28:23] anointing don't you think the Mossad and
[1:28:27] the FBI and the CIA and they I in new a
[1:28:30] a o you
[1:28:31] wants to kill them
[1:28:34] about two weeks into their message
[1:28:38] especially the Mossad they're gonna go
[1:28:41] when you get rid of these two guys but
[1:28:43] still being anointing for three and a
[1:28:44] half years because the Bible said
[1:28:46] they'll prophesy for 1,260 days and then
[1:28:51] wasn't going to do at the end of that
[1:28:52] 1260 days there is no prophecy to go any
[1:28:55] further so that prop that anointing
[1:28:56] lifts off of them and they are
[1:28:59] right there they're killed
[1:29:03] but you and I the difference in you and
[1:29:06] I on all the rest of them you and I keep
[1:29:08] that anointing and we take a body change
[1:29:13] because don't you think they're gonna
[1:29:15] want to kill us our own ranks are gonna
[1:29:17] want to kill us
[1:29:19] it's not that the badness don't care
[1:29:21] anything about us
[1:29:24] who put Jesus in the
[1:29:26] Judas
[1:29:28] hmm right
[1:29:32] that okay
[1:29:37] Moses you killed the people of God and
[1:29:40] the witness that in the Bible when God
[1:29:42] told him
[1:29:44] through Moses he said you come and stand
[1:29:46] right here if you for me stand here if
[1:29:48] you against me stand over there over
[1:29:51] there the ground opened up swallowed all
[1:29:53] them good believers and
[1:29:56] hello
[1:29:58] and the ground swallowed them up
[1:30:01] two days later they go to Moses Moses
[1:30:05] you killed the people of God
[1:30:08] right cäcilie but that's exactly what
[1:30:11] happens to always in your own range
[1:30:14] all right let's read this one quote and
[1:30:16] then well then we'll take communion I'm
[1:30:18] sorry I was gonna try to quit at 3:30
[1:30:19] but here's what read this quoting then
[1:30:22] we'll start back on it next week
[1:30:24] this is on the sixth seal I could say
[1:30:27] something awful good right here but I
[1:30:28] guess I'll hold it till tomorrow night I
[1:30:30] have power over the water to turn over
[1:30:31] the blood smite the earth with plagues
[1:30:33] as often as they will what is it what
[1:30:35] can bring these things but the two
[1:30:37] prophets
[1:30:40] but it's the word first what can bring
[1:30:44] these things but the word they can do
[1:30:47] nature any way they want to hear it is
[1:30:51] their the one who brings on this sixth
[1:30:55] seal they uncover and open it up they
[1:31:00] gotta come to a realization what they're
[1:31:03] here for
[1:31:04] don't you and I have to do the same
[1:31:07] thing you gotta come to a realization
[1:31:08] why you're on this earth
[1:31:11] when the bride realizes who she is and
[1:31:14] what she's doing here why are we gonna
[1:31:16] be an invincible armed invincible army
[1:31:18] because will not be profits at that time
[1:31:20] will not be proper saying will be it
[1:31:24] okay see the six seal is completely an
[1:31:28] interruption of nature do you get it now
[1:31:33] there's your seal there's to see a look
[1:31:35] look at me look at me
[1:31:37] there's the seal that's that little bar
[1:31:40] that was sealed
[1:31:42] but now what's written underneath that
[1:31:44] we got to get okay cuz see that really
[1:31:47] doesn't that doesn't do us any good for
[1:31:49] us to be here when we see earthquakes
[1:31:50] and you better not be here
[1:31:54] but when God deals with your nature on
[1:31:58] this side of the rapture that's on the
[1:32:01] other side this is only I'm telling you
[1:32:03] this is on this side
[1:32:05] it's a complete interruption of nature
[1:32:07] because nobody's ever had this done
[1:32:08] before even Jesus did Jesus had to die
[1:32:11] and
[1:32:12] can be resurrected in the glorified body
[1:32:14] we're talking about skipping that
[1:32:18] amen
[1:32:21] do you get it now there's your seal who
[1:32:23] does it it's the prophets on the other
[1:32:25] side of the rapture with the power of
[1:32:29] God the Word of God they just condemned
[1:32:31] nature that's the same way you and I are
[1:32:34] gonna have to do starting with this
[1:32:36] nature they can send earthquakes turn
[1:32:38] the moon into blood the Sun can go down
[1:32:40] or anything at their command amen there
[1:32:42] you are there you are see how the seals
[1:32:45] opened up down through in the church age
[1:32:47] how it showed the martyrs and now here's
[1:32:49] these two prophets standing here with
[1:32:52] the Word of God to do anything to nature
[1:32:55] they want to and they shape the earth
[1:32:57] and it shows exactly who does it it's
[1:33:01] Moses and Elijah because there's their
[1:33:04] ministry Rhian personated again both men
[1:33:07] oh my do you see it now what the sixth
[1:33:10] seal is it's those prophets now notice
[1:33:15] don't let it choked you but watch what
[1:33:16] open that seal
[1:33:18] prophets
[1:33:20] now brother branham after right after
[1:33:22] that the next quote after that let me
[1:33:24] read the rest they see a man there you
[1:33:25] are oh we're living in the eagle day
[1:33:27] brother heading up among the clouds they
[1:33:29] open that sixth seal they have power to
[1:33:31] do it a man there's your sixth seal
[1:33:32] coming open now the next quote down
[1:33:34] below it will read it next Sunday I
[1:33:36] think brother branham's that I had to
[1:33:38] get up walk out of the room why only a
[1:33:39] prophet can open the seal
[1:33:41] so he knew being a prophet that those
[1:33:45] seals had to be open through him
[1:33:47] that's why it's tonight to get in walk
[1:33:49] out of the room he was sure he'd eat
[1:33:51] what he made it intimate you and I gotta
[1:33:53] make this intimate not me up here
[1:33:55] preaching about a sixth seal you got a
[1:33:57] bit you got to become that it's got to
[1:34:00] be made personal
[1:34:02] the nature nature means to force the law
[1:34:08] the sum of N eight properties and powers
[1:34:11] by which one person differs from other
[1:34:13] distinctive native peculiar a letí's
[1:34:16] natural characteristics the natural
[1:34:19] strength ferocity and intrical 'ti of
[1:34:23] beasts that's nature that's nature out
[1:34:26] there cuz remember
[1:34:28] there was no chain of command except
[1:34:30] there was a there was Adam and the beast
[1:34:33] beasts right
[1:34:36] now it's man beast that eats beast beast
[1:34:40] of these that beast beast of these that
[1:34:42] beast and beast of these that beast now
[1:34:44] that's not true nature the way God
[1:34:46] intended it that's what happened after
[1:34:48] the fall so you and I are gonna have to
[1:34:51] come to a place I believe before we take
[1:34:54] a body change we got to come to a place
[1:34:56] that we do control nature
[1:34:58] this one right here let's all stand this
[1:35:01] nature's got to be under control it can
[1:35:03] only be put under control by the Word of
[1:35:05] God we've tried for 50 years to beat it
[1:35:09] in our flesh
[1:35:11] we wasted a lot of time
[1:35:15] but it had to be we just had to be we
[1:35:17] had that we had to have it but it was a
[1:35:19] it was let's don't say it was a waste of
[1:35:22] time it was it prolonged the inevitable
[1:35:27] that we can come to a place to where
[1:35:29] that we can take a body change in this
[1:35:32] hour not because your dress is dragging
[1:35:34] the ground not cause your sister don't
[1:35:35] cut your hair you men do cut your hair
[1:35:37] you do this you don't do that or you do
[1:35:38] this you don't do that
[1:35:39] it's because what's inside of you is
[1:35:42] gonna do what's inside of you is gonna
[1:35:43] change your body let's bow our head the
[1:35:46] Heavenly Father we pray Lord that you
[1:35:48] would take the feeble words that's been
[1:35:50] spoken and drive them straight to the
[1:35:53] heart of each and every one of us that
[1:35:56] will see that we are truly not
[1:36:00] prophesying of something to come we are
[1:36:02] truly living the prophecy we are as you
[1:36:06] told
[1:36:08] when you were here on earth you said
[1:36:10] before Abraham was I am in other words
[1:36:15] the ever-present God and you've made
[1:36:19] yourself known here now in the end time
[1:36:21] has the ever-present God not a God
[1:36:24] that's still hanging on the cross or a
[1:36:25] god that's coming -
[1:36:27] coming down here they open all the
[1:36:29] graves no it's all gonna be done in
[1:36:30] secret right here in the bride of Jesus
[1:36:33] Christ and you gave us a prophet to
[1:36:37] prophesy and tell us the things that are
[1:36:39] going to happen so we don't have to be a
