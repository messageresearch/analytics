[19:50] God he's give us a middle of the week to
[19:52] come in and and just listen a little bit
[19:56] learn a little bit more about him amen
[19:59] and that's your desire brother Brown
[20:00] said if you don't want no more it want
[20:02] to know more about God there's something
[20:03] wrong with you amen
[20:05] so good to be here by the way of
[20:08] announcements brother down myself and be
[20:10] leaving in the morning going to Kentucky
[20:11] well Illinois brother Richard Douglas
[20:13] will be here Sunday and both services we
[20:17] will be at brother Richard Heights we
[20:19] will not be preaching simply because he
[20:22] asked me to come back the next Sunday so
[20:24] I'm going back the next Sunday and
[20:26] preach for him in Kentucky because he's
[20:27] got a he's some kind of IT guy and he's
[20:30] going to take a trip and he has no other
[20:32] ministers to back him up so we're gonna
[20:35] do that for him but we will be in church
[20:37] service and be back here probably about
[20:38] 8 or 9 o'clock Sunday night so keep
[20:40] saying your prayers and we'll be doing
[20:42] some work up there and it's gonna be hot
[20:44] so just keep us in your prayers also
[20:47] next Wednesday night
[20:49] a week from tonight brother lanlan
[20:50] brother Rolando Genesis will be here
[20:53] from the Philippines he's coming in on
[20:55] Tuesday he just sent me a message and
[20:59] now on September the 8th brother Matthew
[21:01] brave will be here with us that will be
[21:03] the weekend of the of the Bible study so
[21:08] that will be September the 8th and then
[21:10] September the 15th I'll be at brother
[21:12] Tim Humes for Sunday service for him so
[21:15] just keep all these things and you pray
[21:17] if you got your Bibles let's turn to
[21:20] first Corinthians 15 I want to take a
[21:26] little subject that it comes up
[21:33] it comes up quite often and there's a
[21:39] truth to it but I'm gonna read you a
[21:43] quote in a minute we're brother Brown
[21:44] say one word off one word off took them
[21:49] out of the Garden of Eden so you can say
[21:52] what you want to tonight but if you
[21:55] think brother Dale and I are and the
[21:57] ministers in this church are dogmatic
[21:58] that's fine with me
[22:00] because one word off and you were going
[22:03] to be doing your funeral
[22:05] one word off you will not take a body
[22:08] change will warm wear it off Jesus
[22:11] Christ was the Word made flesh
[22:13] he took a body change he wasn't one word
[22:18] off he was the word and as you keep this
[22:22] in the back of your mind as we go
[22:23] through this tonight and I may be 9
[22:25] o'clock getting finished but you know
[22:26] what we'll stand out there till 9:30 and
[22:29] talk maybe we'll cut a little bit like
[22:30] talking short outside but I'm gonna get
[22:33] this finished because we got a couple of
[22:35] weeks that were gonna be gone so but
[22:38] remember what brother George Clinton
[22:39] said Sunday boy that was probably the
[22:41] best sermon I ever heard him preach
[22:42] basically Sunday afternoon he said
[22:45] scripture cannot be broken scripture
[22:50] cannot be broken and brother Brown tells
[22:53] us that face final resting place is in
[22:56] the Word of God
[22:59] III was thinking that yesterday I read
[23:02] the Bible now more than I read the
[23:04] prophets message you shall halt well so
[23:09] did everybody else down through time
[23:11] before the Prophet came along you better
[23:14] read your Bible brother Brown didn't say
[23:17] study the message and pray he said if
[23:18] you want to get closer to God read your
[23:20] Bible and pray because that's God
[23:23] talking to you know we know that brother
[23:24] Branham lying the Bible up we couldn't
[23:26] have done it without him but now that we
[23:28] have the divine interpretation the
[23:31] revelation then that filter of the Holy
[23:34] Ghost ought to be able to look down at
[23:36] the Word of God and filter all the junk
[23:39] out a man and that's what we're going to
[23:41] talk about tonight you look at my title
[23:44] and you'll probably understand kind of
[23:46] what
[23:46] where we're going in Adam all died in
[23:53] Adam all died
[23:56] all right first Corinthians 15 we'll
[23:59] read that in just a moment because you
[24:00] know what that's what the Bible says
[24:01] all right so let's go to the Lord and
[24:04] pray for a minute the only father would
[24:05] thank you for this day this you give us
[24:07] Lord we're not here to make anything of
[24:10] ourself but we're here to prove that
[24:12] your word is right and it cannot be
[24:16] compromised it cannot be one word off it
[24:19] must be spoken as you gave it and thank
[24:23] you Father for sending us a prophet that
[24:26] we can take the essence of this message
[24:28] and that we can see what man has
[24:32] pondered and wondered about since the
[24:34] beginning of time you brought us the
[24:38] divine interpretation of the word and
[24:41] that had to come from Almighty God
[24:43] himself because we were lost
[24:45] not so much lost in our soul but we were
[24:47] lost in religion and lost in many things
[24:50] of traditions of man and many false
[24:53] doctrines we all come from different
[24:55] avenues of even denominations and come
[24:58] into the message to see the truth father
[25:00] now that we're here Lord we know that
[25:03] the devil's here also and he's going to
[25:05] try his best to stop us from seeing the
[25:08] truth because that's what he did in the
[25:11] beginning one word is what took him out
[25:14] of the garden so one word off is not
[25:17] gonna put us back in Lord some people
[25:20] may say that can't be done all scripture
[25:24] must be fulfilled we which are alive and
[25:26] remain at the coming of the Lord will
[25:27] not prevent those that are asleep
[25:29] because we'll all be what changed
[25:31] amantha will be changed in a moment in a
[25:34] twinkling I got you promised that in
[25:36] scripture cannot be broken father
[25:38] forgive us of our sins and the daily
[25:40] things that we do against you father we
[25:42] ask you to cleanse those just listening
[25:44] to the Prophet here just a few minutes
[25:46] ago where he prayed Lord for you to
[25:49] forgive him of the things he did that
[25:50] day forgive him of the certain things
[25:52] Lord a prophet how much more are we to
[25:56] get on our knees and say God forgive us
[25:57] of our sins
[26:00] Lord just come and speak today you be
[26:03] the one do the speaking father you're
[26:05] the only one who can do the revealing so
[26:07] as the Holy Ghost comes to anoint Lord
[26:09] we pray that he'll North this whole
[26:11] building they hit anoint everyone that's
[26:13] watching that will understand what's
[26:15] going on in the day and hour that we're
[26:16] living in give us this day father our
[26:19] daily bread Jesus name we pray amen
[26:22] first Corinthians 15:20 says but now is
[26:25] Christ risen from the dead and become
[26:28] the firstfruits of them that slept for
[26:31] since by man came death by man came also
[26:36] the resurrection of the Dead
[26:39] for as in Adam all died
[26:43] now remember the Bible didn't say Adam
[26:45] is the father of all living because he
[26:49] wasn't amen Eve was the mother of all
[26:54] living man Bible says that but Adam was
[26:57] not the father of all living but as in
[26:59] Adam he didn't say an evil died
[27:02] says in Adam all die even so in Christ
[27:05] shall all be made alive there's a
[27:08] contrast there between Adam and Christ
[27:10] the first item in the second Adam but
[27:12] every man in his own order Christ the
[27:15] first fruit afterwards they that are
[27:17] Christ's at his coming now when is the
[27:20] coming of the Lord its revealing of his
[27:22] word is right now today today is the day
[27:25] that Christ is here so you may be seated
[27:26] in the Lord that is blessing to the
[27:28] reading of the word but remember that
[27:29] again remember these two things in Adam
[27:31] all die and scripture cannot be broken
[27:36] same way as as anything and I'm just
[27:40] gonna say this may be a little
[27:45] contentious but I'm gonna say it anyway
[27:47] I don't agree with what brother Joseph
[27:52] Branham doing in in Jeffersonville okay
[27:54] but I do agree that his pretense is is
[27:58] that the people preachers of this
[28:01] message have messed this message up so
[28:03] much get back to the tape I agree with
[28:08] that 100% but it's got to be through a
[28:11] fivefold ministry
[28:13] that gets the message to the people and
[28:15] they will be scripture cannot be broken
[28:19] there will be a five fold ministry that
[28:22] will bring a group of people to the
[28:24] perfection of the Saints a man but I do
[28:27] agree that this message has been messed
[28:30] up by the preachers in the pulpit so
[28:33] much so you could be frustrated and say
[28:36] hey get back to what the tape says well
[28:38] in this church that's not so much but in
[28:40] a lot of other churches they're not
[28:41] saying what's the tape said and then
[28:43] they run it through their own filter and
[28:45] they get something different and then
[28:49] they get something different if you get
[28:51] something different than it's what one
[28:52] word off alright let's go to Genesis
[28:56] 2:15 and I want to and I think some of
[29:01] you know where I'm going there was a it
[29:04] seems like that a doctrine that's real
[29:07] prevalent especially in foreign
[29:08] countries but it originated in them in
[29:11] Canada because I heard that I'm old
[29:13] mouth that that Adam had to place his
[29:16] natural seed into Eve to savor well I
[29:18] don't agree with that that's not in the
[29:20] Bible and brother branham never said
[29:22] that okay so you run it through your
[29:25] filter tonight but I'm gonna read you
[29:27] the Bible and I'm gonna read you the
[29:29] prophets message and you got to run it
[29:32] through your Holy Ghost filter tonight
[29:37] you run it through your Holy Ghost
[29:39] filter because I just read you the Bible
[29:41] says in Adam all die that's what the
[29:47] Bible says
[29:47] so whatever brother branham teaches the
[29:50] same way with the Daniel 7 new weeks and
[29:51] all the things that that people say that
[29:54] he was offer or missed it or whatever
[29:58] they want to say it wrong it's got to
[30:01] compare with the Bible if face final
[30:04] resting place is in the Word of God then
[30:06] that's why I said that's why I told you
[30:07] I do I read the Bible now every morning
[30:09] 30 minutes every morning and I probably
[30:12] don't read that much of the message
[30:14] because I believe now this is just me I
[30:17] believe if you get the essence of the
[30:19] message for Louisville now we're talking
[30:21] about this other day getting the essence
[30:23] of the message
[30:24] it's not a verbatim quote
[30:26] because a verbatim quote you may say
[30:28] anything you want to say but the essence
[30:31] of the message listen true redemption
[30:34] through the opening of the seals will
[30:36] straighten up all doctrine all doctrine
[30:42] will be straightened up with the
[30:43] revelation of the seven seals not just
[30:46] on the surface but all that year and a
[30:48] half that I spent that God with God's
[30:50] help to try to get you to see the plan
[30:53] of redemption because the plan of
[30:55] redemption did not did not come from man
[30:59] sperm
[31:00] please that's where everything got all
[31:02] messed up
[31:04] listen that was the quote that he
[31:08] planted this error that the preacher
[31:11] said and I've heard he said many many
[31:12] times that Adam had to place as natural
[31:15] Steve indeed seed and Eber saber no you
[31:17] know what that's what killed her she
[31:22] died anyway
[31:23] she fell they both needed a lamb they
[31:28] both needed a redeemer and I'm gonna
[31:30] prove it right here and the Lord took
[31:32] the man and put him in the Garden of
[31:33] Eden to dress in to keep it now remember
[31:36] there's a couple of things we gotta
[31:38] cover tonight and listen if I get too
[31:40] fast hold your hand up and say slow down
[31:42] okay hold your hand up and say slow down
[31:44] all right but I'm gonna try to clear
[31:47] this up by what by the Word of God all
[31:51] right so let's read this right here real
[31:53] quick I said I'm gonna read it real
[31:55] quick dinner I just said who's gonna
[31:56] read it real quick didn't hold you hand
[31:59] out sec slow down okay and the Lord God
[32:01] took the man now watch Genesis 1:26 man
[32:06] was that theophany man that God in
[32:09] Genesis 1:26 says let us make man in our
[32:11] own image all right now that person that
[32:15] theophany was Adam that part that God
[32:19] was putting on the earth to be the
[32:21] gardener that was Adam is all right that
[32:24] was Adam in spirit form theophany not a
[32:30] tangible flesh man because when Genesis
[32:33] 2 he takes that man and puts him into
[32:37] human flesh that all right
[32:40] amen he puts that Genesis 1:26 man into
[32:44] the Genesis to six men and that gives
[32:47] God a man on earth in human flesh to
[32:52] rule the world and to do whatever it
[32:55] needs to do on the earth to contact the
[32:56] earth that's what our five senses are
[32:58] given to us for see taste smell felling
[32:59] smell see taste tell me to be quiet tell
[33:03] me to slow down see taste feel smelling
[33:05] here - what brother Graham told us that
[33:06] contacted our earthly home see taste
[33:10] feel smelling here we use it every day
[33:12] all right but now then you got the five
[33:15] inner senses memory reason conscience
[33:16] affection imagination now we're at in
[33:19] mind because we're fixing - I want you
[33:21] to watch how this reacts in the Garden
[33:24] of Eden you'll see what happened between
[33:26] Adam and Eve because remember God says
[33:28] you don't love there's a filial love and
[33:36] an agape love figlio love is that memory
[33:40] reason conscious affection and then you
[33:46] cannot love God without having the Holy
[33:49] Ghost in your soul you cannot love God
[33:53] all right
[33:54] that's a gap in love that's the love of
[33:58] God but now the love you have for your
[34:01] wife it's not a godly love it's feel
[34:04] your love amen all right and the Lord
[34:09] took Lord God took the man and put him
[34:13] in the Garden of Eden to dress it in to
[34:14] keep it now remember he's already
[34:15] putting them in human flesh and we're
[34:17] going to cover that in just a minute and
[34:18] the Lord God commanded the man saying of
[34:21] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[34:23] freely eat but of the tree of the
[34:26] knowledge of good and evil thou shalt
[34:28] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[34:32] eatest thereof thou shalt surely die now
[34:36] we know what brother Brown said to the
[34:37] thousand years of the day in the day is
[34:39] a thousand years no one lived my foods
[34:41] will live 969 years Adam didn't live but
[34:44] 900 didn't live but 900 it be nice to be
[34:47] nice
[34:48] clearly that sister claimed that be ten
[34:50] times what you are now goodness gracious
[34:54] but thank God we don't live that long
[34:56] could you imagine America sunny but 300
[34:57] years old
[34:58] if he was 900 years old you was way back
[35:00] in under and hey using three Church ages
[35:03] backwards so thank God we don't have to
[35:06] do that but the tree of knowledge of
[35:08] good and evil thou shalt not eat them
[35:10] now remember what was that tree that
[35:13] they were not supposed to touch what was
[35:18] that tree that they were not supposed to
[35:19] touch he said well that was Satan yeah
[35:24] and I've got another quote brother Bram
[35:25] said it was Eve not supposed to touch it
[35:29] and the fruit in the midst of the garden
[35:33] if you order want to know what I'm
[35:35] talking about
[35:36] because remember you are the fruit of
[35:38] your mother amen that's where God hid
[35:42] that with Moses he hid that into that he
[35:45] said / took of the fruit well you're the
[35:49] fruit of the womb all right there buddy
[35:51] okay with that I may say some things
[35:54] that may be a little you mount to
[35:55] explain to your kids but you know what
[35:56] just got to say what I gotta say and the
[35:59] Lord God said it is not good that the
[36:01] man should be alone I will make him an
[36:04] help meet for him now remember like
[36:05] brother Dale says that doesn't say help
[36:07] me that says help me that's somebody
[36:09] right here besides you because remember
[36:11] we forget all these other quotes and we
[36:14] just say what somebody else said because
[36:18] somebody's got a big name in the message
[36:19] and we listen to them YouTube or
[36:22] whatever it is we just quote it because
[36:25] they quote it
[36:26] you better not you better study what we
[36:29] say cuz it's your soul and then the Lord
[36:37] God said is not good that man should be
[36:38] alone because remember before the fall
[36:40] Adam and Eve we're cold
[36:41] equal coal equal until after I mean it's
[36:48] not until after the fall that God put
[36:50] man over the woman they were co-equal
[36:54] and Eve being a byproduct of Adam didn't
[36:59] make her a lesser vessel it made her the
[37:02] same thing
[37:03] all right brother discovered that many
[37:05] many times I want you to I want
[37:07] stir up some of this background that
[37:08] you've heard for 50 years all right and
[37:11] some of you hadn't heard it so we're
[37:12] gonna try to stir that ground up again
[37:13] and out of the ground the Lord God
[37:15] formed every beast of the field and
[37:17] every fowl of the air and brought them
[37:20] unto Adam to see what he would call them
[37:22] and whatsoever Adam called every living
[37:24] creature that was the name thereof Adam
[37:29] named all the animals and like I said
[37:31] many times before when he was naming the
[37:33] animals God wasn't nervous God said
[37:38] that's exactly what I was thinking
[37:40] that's exactly what I was thinking why
[37:42] because that him had the mind of Christ
[37:44] at that time all right everybody
[37:46] understand that same Emory and Adam gave
[37:49] names to all cattle and to foul the air
[37:51] to every beast of the field but for Adam
[37:53] there was not found and helped me for
[37:55] him in other words Adam brings the lion
[37:57] up well the lion didn't come by itself
[37:59] mrs. lion came to mrs. beast came to a
[38:05] man that was a male lion and a female
[38:09] line because back in Genesis before
[38:13] Genesis the sixth day of creation listen
[38:19] there was intercourse between the
[38:24] animals and they were producing babies
[38:27] thereby okay with that you say well how
[38:30] do you know that well when God took that
[38:32] lamb and slew it and took the skins off
[38:35] and throwed one into Adam and throwed
[38:36] one into Eve that would have ended the
[38:38] lamb line if that would have been the
[38:41] only two lambs on the face of the earth
[38:43] Deb I understand that okay so it's not a
[38:46] problem with the animals reproducing God
[38:50] tells them in Genesis multiply and
[38:52] replenish the earth but he doesn't tell
[38:55] them to subdue it like he does in
[38:57] Genesis once when he says you've heard
[38:58] his preaching that many times before
[38:59] because you and I have the position that
[39:02] we have we have that God nature they
[39:05] have nature we have a garden nature
[39:09] because we have a soul and God in
[39:12] creative evolution well that's hard to
[39:15] say no brother Brown said it
[39:17] in creative evolution he started with a
[39:20] small and come all the way up you know
[39:22] what he comes all the way to the monkey
[39:23] and then he puts the beast and then he
[39:27] brings man and puts man into human flesh
[39:30] hey man let's question many times before
[39:33] that people have asked him I want to
[39:36] settle this tonight the reason that you
[39:40] and I the reason that Adam and Eve were
[39:43] put in a body they were put in everybody
[39:46] understand me it's because it was animal
[39:50] flesh so when he put Adam in his body he
[39:55] had a male part when he made Eve to be
[40:01] in creative evolution he had to make a
[40:03] Eve with a female part you know what the
[40:06] word woman means it means a man with a
[40:08] womb a man woman means man with a womb
[40:13] now remember he didn't call her evey
[40:15] called her woman she became even after
[40:18] the fall all right
[40:20] so watch what happens is when Adam when
[40:24] God brings all these cow and fowl
[40:26] they're reproducing but Adam is standing
[40:29] there and can't reproduce anything he's
[40:32] alone he needs a womb to reproduce
[40:36] himself to reproduce himself because
[40:41] listen you got to take this all and type
[40:43] it to Christ Christ needs a womb to
[40:48] reproduce himself not a physical wound
[40:51] but a womb of the mind because listen
[40:54] Satan got to Eve's wound first in here
[40:57] up here then the act happened this is
[41:00] where the fall started not down there
[41:03] that was just the that was just what
[41:05] that was a manifestation of what was up
[41:07] here I hope everybody understands that
[41:09] that's really like ABCs okay but it's
[41:11] gonna help explain what we're talking
[41:13] about here in a few minutes but for Adam
[41:15] was not found to help meet for him
[41:17] and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[41:20] fall upon Adam and he slept took one of
[41:22] his ribs closed up the flesh instead
[41:24] thereof what a wonderful operation did
[41:27] him leave a scar and the rib which the
[41:30] Lord God take
[41:31] took from man made he a woman what put
[41:34] her in female flesh because listen Adam
[41:39] and Eve he told them to multiply and
[41:43] replenish the earth you can't do that
[41:46] with one person Adam said this is now
[41:52] bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh
[41:55] now as we've said many times before that
[41:58] is a literal statement whatever God took
[42:02] the DNA he took out of Adam that bone
[42:05] that rib he took out of Adam and he
[42:08] formed Eve and put that theophany of Eve
[42:11] inside that flesh called woman was
[42:15] Adam's flesh but it was the female part
[42:20] because in Genesis 1:26 let's create men
[42:22] our own image male and female created he
[42:25] them male and female
[42:26] crazy hot you have a male and a female
[42:28] and then brother branham always talks
[42:31] about you don't take a woman to your
[42:33] bosom because there's always an imprint
[42:35] well you know what think about that
[42:40] that's what he wanted he wanted us to
[42:44] have an imprint think about it whatever
[42:48] the male is the female is just the
[42:50] inverted of what the male is so it's a
[42:55] man with the womb to what to reproduce
[42:58] yourself God told him to multiply and
[43:00] replenish Eric so he told them they were
[43:03] just gonna do what God told him to do
[43:05] but Adam couldn't do it myself so God
[43:08] instead of going and getting what
[43:10] somewhere out here in the dust he takes
[43:14] from Adam and makes his self his self he
[43:21] reproduced he makes himself so he can
[43:24] reproduce because remember her name was
[43:26] Adam we're not gonna read it but
[43:29] remember the Bible says and her name
[43:31] their name with Adam why because they
[43:34] were the same except she had the
[43:36] feminist part and he had the masculine
[43:38] part so don't worry about you know don't
[43:41] worry about why God put us the way we
[43:42] are he knew we'd fall and you
[43:44] need what we needed but still being in
[43:46] creative evolution we had to come just
[43:49] like the animals and I'll read it in
[43:52] just a minute I'm not just gonna say it
[43:53] I'm gonna read your quote it's what has
[43:55] told them other day when I was preaching
[43:56] somewhere else the last time I preached
[43:57] and I said I said something oh it was in
[43:59] Arizona and I said something they all
[44:00] kind of went I said don't you believe I
[44:03] got a quote for it if I won't stand out
[44:04] here and say this don't you like a quote
[44:06] for it therefore look and I don't said
[44:09] this is now bone of my bone flesh them
[44:10] up there she shall be called woman
[44:12] because she was taken out of man man
[44:16] therefore shall a man leave his father
[44:17] and mother and shall cleave unto his
[44:19] wife and they shall be one flesh and
[44:21] they were both naked the man and his
[44:23] wife and we're not ashamed
[44:25] I missed the quote didn't uh no I didn't
[44:30] now let's read this quote right here
[44:31] I had to insert this this is one of my
[44:34] favorite sermons I quoted a lot its
[44:37] oneness 1962 very good this is where
[44:41] brother man talks about God and Adam and
[44:43] Eve being one because that's what we got
[44:46] to get back to now let's think seriously
[44:48] because you never be able to think
[44:50] anymore after this after this mortal
[44:51] life is over your thinking is now you
[44:54] cannot choose after this you must choose
[44:56] now for this is the day of choosing
[44:58] making your choice now she is talking
[45:01] about Eve one word not a hold the
[45:04] ecology doc log or whatever that is
[45:06] Decalogue just one word she questioned
[45:12] God because it was presented to her in
[45:14] that light that that word was
[45:16] questionable God's Word cannot be
[45:20] questioned like brother Quinn said all
[45:23] scripture cannot be broken and all
[45:25] scriptures got to be fulfilled so you
[45:27] can't break scripture in any doctrine
[45:29] you have it has to come straight through
[45:31] the scripture and I just read this
[45:34] scripture word but the Bible says it
[45:36] Adam all die all right so there was
[45:38] nothing redeemable about Adam or with
[45:40] Adam all right God's Word cannot be
[45:43] questioned he meant just what he said
[45:45] but she questioned it because it was
[45:47] presented to her what Satan was
[45:50] preaching her sermon from his pulpit
[45:53] through the Beast but she questioned it
[45:56] because it was presented
[45:57] to her oh god Shirley didn't mean that
[46:00] but he did mean that God means every
[46:03] word he says and it doesn't need any
[46:06] private interpretation it's just the way
[46:08] he said it will you say how you know
[46:10] about the Bible I believe that my God
[46:13] has guided this Bible he watches over
[46:16] his word he knowed that atheists and
[46:20] infidels would rise in the last day so
[46:22] he's watched over it this is exactly the
[46:26] way God minute it's the way it's to us
[46:29] now now we must believe it one word off
[46:33] of it and we lose our fellowship go off
[46:37] into to death eternal separation from
[46:40] God just as Adam and Eve did we must
[46:42] believe God's truth so that was in in
[46:47] line with with you you think sometimes
[46:51] that we're like said combative and
[46:53] dogmatic no Lee we're just trying to
[46:56] save you so we're just trying to get by
[46:57] I want to see everybody take a body
[46:58] change I don't want just preach a little
[47:00] vanilla sermon that how good you are and
[47:02] you're good but I do want to show you
[47:04] though when it folks doctrine comes in
[47:06] what to do with it you take it back to
[47:08] the Word of God you take it back to the
[47:11] Word of God and really you don't have to
[47:13] take you to the prophets message because
[47:14] you might find a quote that's kind of
[47:16] like what's the person said but if you
[47:18] take it back to the Bible this is the
[47:23] way exactly the way God meant it
[47:26] everybody all right say man now let's
[47:29] start I've only got 15 more quotes to go
[47:31] we okay hmm
[47:32] questions and answers don't Genesis now
[47:37] but then there's no man to till the soil
[47:40] no man to till the soil this is in
[47:45] coming of the scripture we just read and
[47:46] then God formed man Genesis 2:7 out of
[47:49] the dust of the earth now we follow it
[47:52] he formed a man out of the dust of the
[47:54] earth and put this supernatural spirit
[47:58] got it
[47:59] Genesis 1:26 man he put into that 2:7
[48:04] man that's that supernatural spirit he's
[48:06] talking about because there's no way
[48:08] item could name all the animals
[48:11] and rule the earth would not having some
[48:13] kind of god quality inside of him amen
[48:17] he had to be led by the Holy Ghost even
[48:22] brother Brian said they had the Holy
[48:23] Ghost veil over their eyes because they
[48:25] were naked and didn't know it but see
[48:27] that's a problem but when the fall
[48:29] happened that veil was lifted and now we
[48:32] live under a lust veil that's what he
[48:34] said
[48:35] I didn't bring that quote but that's
[48:36] pretty strong but that's what he said
[48:38] and we do you got your anybody got a
[48:42] problem with that yeah we live on that's
[48:45] what we live under that's why it takes
[48:46] the Holy Ghost to make us turn our head
[48:48] men and women it takes the Holy Ghost to
[48:51] turn us away from that and that has to
[48:56] be the one inside because before we had
[48:58] our conversations in the flesh
[49:00] Paul said in times past with the white
[49:03] lust of the flesh all right but being
[49:07] born-again now what we turn that turn
[49:09] and we focus our supernatural love to
[49:13] God and our natural filial love to our
[49:16] wife and then our husband back and forth
[49:19] all right now he was laying there I can
[49:22] have many pictures of it I can see Adam
[49:24] standing now I believe him brother
[49:27] branham's looking at a picture I believe
[49:28] he's really looking at a picture I
[49:30] believe he's looking he listened he had
[49:34] the first wife I there ever was since
[49:36] God because God would just throw a
[49:38] screen up right there and show him what
[49:40] was going to happen or what had happened
[49:41] or what's fixing to happen didn't need
[49:43] no wires didn't need an antenna he just
[49:47] whipped there it was bluetooth I can
[49:53] have many pictures of it I can see Adam
[49:55] stamp why do you think he knew but he
[49:56] was blond-haired blue-eyed he saw her
[50:01] and you know what that was kind of
[50:04] strange brother branham come up in the
[50:05] era of no color television he'd sit
[50:07] there watched Bonanza or Gunsmoke in
[50:09] black and white but when he was telling
[50:12] the people their problems he said I see
[50:13] you got on a blue dress and you and
[50:16] you're driving a red car if he was
[50:19] looking and he was looking in
[50:20] Technicolor and we were looking to black
[50:22] right right thank God for a spiritual
[50:24] line
[50:25] Stein they came to tell us and give us
[50:29] clarity not change the Bible one iota
[50:31] but to give us clarity of what God was
[50:34] talking about amen
[50:36] look see him standing like a tree God
[50:40] had made him he was dead as he could be
[50:43] his toes like roots were sticking in the
[50:46] ground God said let there be or breed
[50:49] the black breath of life into him and he
[50:52] jumped came to himself he was breathed
[50:56] the breath of life into him he became a
[50:58] living soul and he began to move on move
[51:01] on and then God taken from his side a
[51:04] piece of him a rib it made a woman see
[51:08] he didn't take even go over there and
[51:09] pull her out of the roots like she's
[51:11] like the wood show that here comes Eve
[51:14] no he'd come out of Adam that's why you
[51:17] and I come out of Christ because you got
[51:21] to think your contrast because remember
[51:23] the first item was in the transgression
[51:25] the second Adam's what brought it back
[51:27] so see there was no redemption in the
[51:28] first Adam he's want to killed us the
[51:34] second item is one that brought us up
[51:36] the second one is not planting natural
[51:39] seed he's planting a spiritual spoken
[51:42] word seed like he was supposed to have
[51:44] in the beginning amen
[51:46] and then God take him from his side a
[51:49] piece of him a rib and made a woman now
[51:51] where did he get the spirit woman see
[51:52] when Genesis 1:26 he said let us make
[51:54] man in our image after our own likeness
[51:59] created he them man male and female he
[52:05] made the burly spirit for the man he
[52:07] made the tender Lord delicate feminine
[52:08] spirit for the woman how wonderful and
[52:11] you know what that all came from God
[52:13] they didn't come from the devil he can't
[52:15] make that he can pervert that but he
[52:18] can't make that all right so let's
[52:20] continue on number two look Jesus came
[52:24] to manifest the father this is questions
[52:26] and answers 1954 look in the beginning
[52:29] God made man in his own image is that
[52:30] right now see I'm building the
[52:32] foundation to bring us to what what
[52:34] we're gonna talk about okay mm-hmm so go
[52:37] with me here
[52:38] in the beginning God made man in his own
[52:40] image is that right well what is God a
[52:42] spirit st. John 2:4 chapter Jesus
[52:45] speaking to the woman at the well he
[52:47] said God is a spirit and they that
[52:48] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[52:50] and in truth is that right if God made
[52:54] man in his own image what kind of man
[52:56] did he make then a spirit man so the
[52:59] spirit man was made first and remember
[53:01] that spirit man wasn't made as nothing
[53:05] and then here's something because that
[53:07] would mean that would have a beginning
[53:09] and it does not eternal life doesn't
[53:11] have a beginning remember we've been
[53:13] through this before the word created
[53:16] remember an automobile was in the Garden
[53:20] of Eden because every element that you
[53:24] got out there in your car I don't care
[53:25] if it's plastic titanium alloy wheels
[53:29] rubber it was all in the ground at some
[53:32] period of time there's nothing new Under
[53:34] the Sun everything automobile was in the
[53:36] Garden of Eden
[53:37] it just wasn't created but it was always
[53:41] there so this Genesis 1:26 man always
[53:45] was he was in God he was a part of God
[53:48] and then he comes out to what to come
[53:51] down to me and you to make us a God that
[53:56] all right in Genesis 2 there was no man
[54:02] to till the salt now he's talking
[54:03] Genesis 1 is the spirit man Genesis 2
[54:06] there was no man to till the soil and
[54:07] God made man out of the dust of the
[54:10] earth not in his image but in the image
[54:15] of animal life hand like a bear foot
[54:22] like a chimpanzee
[54:23] he's done told us there's many many
[54:24] quotes and he put the spirit of man in
[54:28] this animal man here and he became a
[54:30] living soul now that's the difference
[54:33] between a man and the animal the animal
[54:35] don't build automobiles
[54:37] he doesn't do things like that to help
[54:39] his living and so forth like that he's
[54:40] an animal dumb brute some of us may fall
[54:44] into that category but he hasn't got a
[54:47] soul the animal doesn't have a soul
[54:49] he can't read and write he
[54:52] can't talk speak he's a dumb booth but a
[54:55] man is in flesh like a brute but he's
[54:58] got a soul of God in him that makes him
[55:00] immortal boy that's pretty heavy and he
[55:04] can invent look what he can do he's
[55:06] owned almost on the equal with God we'll
[55:08] look at today they broke into God's
[55:11] laboratory they went all the way back to
[55:13] DNA and all these different things that
[55:14] that man even it brother branham's era
[55:18] it wasn't possible now they make it
[55:22] possible because he's the son of God
[55:24] even in his fallenness state he's
[55:26] wonderful all right so let's go to the
[55:30] next one now make some comments after
[55:33] this after we get done around here I
[55:36] will restore unto you saith the Lord
[55:39] 1954 all things beginning cults begin
[55:42] the Church of God began in Genesis you
[55:46] believe that notice closely now as we go
[55:48] into it now now the two that we want to
[55:50] deal with today now here is my
[55:52] conception that's when God made man in
[55:54] his own image he made him spirit man of
[55:57] course because God is a spirit and they
[56:00] that worship Him must worship Him in
[56:01] spirit and in truth now I did not bring
[56:05] this quote but remember if you if you
[56:07] know the essence of the message brother
[56:08] Branham said God knew when he put him in
[56:10] human flesh they would fall can't fall
[56:14] that Genesis 1:26 man cannot fall never
[56:17] will fall never had a bad day never
[56:19] sinned today in his life because that's
[56:21] what came into you at the new birth and
[56:25] recreated the way it should have been
[56:29] had there not been a fall so we're not
[56:32] so far off for this are we then he made
[56:36] man out of the dust of the earth that's
[56:39] why I think botanists and so forth get
[56:41] their chronologiste and gets all
[56:43] scrupled up in other words what he's
[56:45] talking about is you know they say man
[56:46] this man is twenty million years old and
[56:48] this one forty million years old because
[56:49] of carbon dating and he says foolish and
[56:51] I believe it is too when you realize
[56:54] that man and his five senses to contact
[56:56] his earthly home is in the image of
[56:59] beasts not in the image of God
[57:06] man made in god's image was spirit man
[57:11] then he took that spirit man and put it
[57:14] into the two seven men are the flesh man
[57:16] that was made like animal with a male
[57:19] being the way a male's made and a female
[57:22] being the way the females made is that
[57:24] all right
[57:24] and then there's no man to till the soil
[57:27] he put man in the image of beasts life
[57:31] and I know what you're thinking right
[57:33] now
[57:34] the Bible says there's different kinds
[57:36] of flesh of an animal and all these day
[57:37] and we can't coincide with them do you
[57:39] know why we can't do you know why we
[57:45] can't we actually could could have
[57:55] you're forgetting the Beast
[57:57] you're forgetting to be in creative
[58:00] evolution brother branham's that he can
[58:01] lean back toward the animals but he
[58:04] could what except except the one except
[58:07] of woman of the because that's what
[58:09] happened okay what did God do God
[58:11] totally took that missing link took it
[58:15] out of the picture so there's no way we
[58:17] can get back and go inside with animals
[58:20] just real simple real simple
[58:25] he put man in the image of beasts life
[58:28] why creative evolution monkey little
[58:32] higher intelligence the beast obviously
[58:37] he was close enough to man to coincide
[58:39] with man you understand what I mean
[58:40] mingle seed mingle and be able to stand
[58:43] upright and talk I mean that's just the
[58:48] truth and then said when God cut that
[58:49] thing off
[58:50] he writes over in the New Testament he
[58:52] said now there's life of animal you know
[58:54] he said don't lay with beasts and all
[58:56] these things in the New Testament I mean
[58:57] the Old Testament everybody got that
[58:59] pretty plain why cuz he cut that off
[59:02] because that was so that's where the sin
[59:04] act happened was right here in that gap
[59:06] the missing link we all went to school
[59:09] and everybody said we don't know what
[59:10] they missed the link is well you know
[59:11] what it's in the Bible but they don't
[59:15] understand it because I got a I got a
[59:17] little quote here from
[59:18] from the Greek lexicon
[59:22] that talks about I just pulled it up it
[59:25] says Adam the meaning of Adam is the red
[59:27] earth the first man the parent of the
[59:29] whole human race that's a lie we know
[59:34] it's a lie
[59:35] Adam is not the parent of all human race
[59:37] don't look at me like that
[59:39] the Beast there is a beast see don't
[59:42] miss our Lord from Cain that's why the
[59:50] Bible says Adams not to father of all
[59:52] women but Eve is the mother of all
[59:56] living
[59:57] remember Cain and Abel were
[59:58] half-brothers they weren't full brothers
[1:00:00] they were half-brothers and that was the
[1:00:04] Beast seed that's still here brother
[1:00:07] Brown may ask him still wears it out he
[1:00:09] said it's still here God didn't kill
[1:00:13] Cain Cain killed Abel tried to cut it
[1:00:17] off and Adam and Eve had to get back
[1:00:19] together bring Seth
[1:00:21] but that Cain lineage he went off to the
[1:00:23] Land of Nod and populated the world half
[1:00:26] as much as the rest of them did
[1:00:28] everybody okay with that so there was a
[1:00:31] beast life that beast lineage is down
[1:00:34] through there somewhere we know it's all
[1:00:36] mingled together because the sons of God
[1:00:37] met the daughters of man and they died
[1:00:39] all just kind of intertwined
[1:00:40] there's no way you can get a full
[1:00:41] lineage of one or the other it's like
[1:00:43] brother Dale said I don't care if
[1:00:45] they've traced me back and I'm Cain's
[1:00:47] 759 millionth cousin I don't care the
[1:00:51] blood of Jesus Christ take care of all
[1:00:52] that and then that's why he had to come
[1:00:55] back to take care of that Lord he put
[1:01:00] man in the image of beasts life he might
[1:01:02] give him a hand like a monkey a foot
[1:01:04] like a bear never brother branham he
[1:01:06] even used the analogy when you skinned a
[1:01:08] bear now this is him when you skinned a
[1:01:10] bear it looks like a small child why cuz
[1:01:14] that that creative evolution right up to
[1:01:18] man and that's why we're in that's in
[1:01:20] the flesh part that we're in it's
[1:01:23] because of creative evolution but the
[1:01:26] difference between the animal and the
[1:01:28] man he made him a soul a living soul
[1:01:30] because the spirit of
[1:01:32] God was in the man and then the only way
[1:01:35] that God could redeem the man have
[1:01:42] nothing to do with the first item right
[1:01:45] zero zero to do with the first atom
[1:01:52] right because the spirit goes in and
[1:01:55] then the only way that God could redeem
[1:01:58] the man then God came down and was made
[1:02:03] flesh to redeem the man that had
[1:02:05] condemned in the flesh and Adam couldn't
[1:02:09] be our Redeemer he couldn't even be
[1:02:11] listen to be a kinsman redeemer you had
[1:02:13] to be just like your kinfolk right Adam
[1:02:16] wasn't born Adam was created a
[1:02:21] full-grown man he cannot and will never
[1:02:23] be our brother but Jesus Christ came out
[1:02:26] of the womb by the spoken word of God
[1:02:31] that's the whole deal it's the spoken
[1:02:34] word is original seed that's nothing man
[1:02:37] sperm will kill you we're dead while
[1:02:41] we're walking
[1:02:41] I was thinking other day I was in the
[1:02:43] airport all those people five or six
[1:02:47] thousand people down that one thing in
[1:02:50] Atlanta y'all know how crazy it is down
[1:02:51] there we're all born same way and we all
[1:02:56] had the same choice everyone there's not
[1:03:00] a person you can't look at nobody
[1:03:01] walking down the street and go they were
[1:03:03] made different than me no they came the
[1:03:06] same way right so we're all put on the
[1:03:10] same level and even Adam and Eve was put
[1:03:13] on free moral agency to decide what they
[1:03:16] were gonna do when they were putting
[1:03:18] human flesh then the only way to God for
[1:03:25] name of the man then God came down and
[1:03:27] was made flesh to redeem the man that he
[1:03:29] had condemned in the flesh that's when
[1:03:33] Jesus Christ the Son of God was made
[1:03:35] flesh and dwelt among us is everybody
[1:03:38] alright with that say man it's pretty
[1:03:41] simple okay alright let's read
[1:03:45] number four and then make a comment here
[1:03:49] number four I just want you to
[1:03:51] understand why we're putting the bodies
[1:03:52] that we're puttin because remember
[1:03:54] brother Branham says when we go back
[1:03:57] when we go back to the Garden of Eden
[1:04:02] there's no sex organs because your
[1:04:08] theophany don't have one the spoken word
[1:04:17] is the original seed and the word is the
[1:04:20] seed that's the only seed we better be
[1:04:22] worried about listen you had no way
[1:04:25] none of you ever decided that you were
[1:04:30] coming here you had zero to do with it
[1:04:36] that's my brother Brahms he said I can
[1:04:39] see I can see the virgin birth God
[1:04:44] creates the sperm earth crisis one germ
[1:04:46] brings an egg out of creation places in
[1:04:50] the womb he said you got here by
[1:04:52] millions upon millions of eggs and
[1:04:55] millions upon millions of germ and then
[1:04:58] they crawled over each other and Powell
[1:05:01] there you are
[1:05:03] God's gonna get you here anyway hey man
[1:05:07] now our bodies made out of 16 different
[1:05:10] elements of the world they're male cam I
[1:05:11] hurt anybody's feelings some of you look
[1:05:14] I am you know he's gonna have a little
[1:05:19] sex education class did you know our
[1:05:21] bodies are made out of sixteen different
[1:05:22] elements of the world we know that made
[1:05:25] out of potash a little calcium and
[1:05:27] petroleum and cosmic light and atoms and
[1:05:28] so forth all bundled together and makes
[1:05:32] this body come from the dust of the
[1:05:34] earth and remember even brother Brown
[1:05:37] says your body was in the Garden of Eden
[1:05:41] your body was in the Garden of Eden your
[1:05:43] literal body somewhere in that potash
[1:05:46] counts him and all that you eat food as
[1:05:52] you eat food then turns into from the
[1:05:54] dust it comes from the dust it just goes
[1:05:56] right on your flesh as far as your flow
[1:05:59] is no different from a horse or from a
[1:06:02] cow or anything else it's still just
[1:06:06] flesh hmm keep going and boy you glorify
[1:06:13] the flesh but that spirit has a soul in
[1:06:17] there my brother that's right but your
[1:06:19] flesh is just dust of the earth like the
[1:06:22] animal your flesh is no more than an
[1:06:24] animal and if you lust after the flesh
[1:06:26] and the thing you see lust after women
[1:06:29] left after these different things it's
[1:06:31] still animal that's right that's right
[1:06:35] you shouldn't do it the Spirit of God
[1:06:37] will lead you on and put you on a higher
[1:06:39] plane than that that's what the Holy
[1:06:41] Ghost was given for was to bring you to
[1:06:44] a higher plane amen
[1:06:50] all right now let's read this one let's
[1:06:53] see what Adams led literal seed this is
[1:06:56] what was said the liberal seed was
[1:06:57] placed in Eve to save her right I got
[1:07:02] the quote from where it was said all
[1:07:03] right and I've heard it I've heard it
[1:07:05] been preached two or three different
[1:07:06] times in different places and it's false
[1:07:09] it's wrong it's not right it's not
[1:07:13] biblical so if it's not bad because it's
[1:07:17] wrong I don't care who says it now
[1:07:21] couldn't we stop here just a man get a
[1:07:22] real sermon oh if the blood has cleansed
[1:07:24] it back what about now now this is in
[1:07:27] the breeze right when you get ready to
[1:07:28] preach the seals look what the Son of
[1:07:29] God the second Adam did said the works
[1:07:32] that I do show you also see Adam lost
[1:07:37] his inheritance the earth now listen
[1:07:40] Adam didn't looses eternal life God's
[1:07:43] not an Indian giver he didn't give out
[1:07:45] of eternal life and then take it away
[1:07:46] from him
[1:07:47] he took the ability for Adam to take
[1:07:50] this thing and make it eternal cousin
[1:07:54] Adam all died all right so Adam lost his
[1:07:58] inheritance the earth now it passed from
[1:08:00] his hand to the one he sold out to Satan
[1:08:04] he sold his faith in God to Satan's
[1:08:07] reasoning therefore his eternal life now
[1:08:10] look his right to the Tree of Life
[1:08:12] his
[1:08:13] to the earth belong to him and he
[1:08:14] forfeited every bit to the hands of
[1:08:16] Satan now if you read that quote and
[1:08:18] don't get the essence of the message you
[1:08:20] see brother Brown says he lost his
[1:08:21] eternal life he lost his ability to
[1:08:24] become eternal in his flesh he did not
[1:08:27] lose his God ship eternal life in his
[1:08:29] soul okay because remember if you keep
[1:08:33] reading your genealogy there in the Book
[1:08:35] of Luke 3 it goes down and says an atom
[1:08:37] which was the son of God okay therefore
[1:08:42] now it has been it returned and has been
[1:08:46] polluted the seed of Adam has destroyed
[1:08:52] not saved or redeemed the seed of Adam
[1:08:58] has destroyed the inheritance that Adam
[1:09:01] should have had that's the earth and
[1:09:04] that's this earth right that's right the
[1:09:09] seed of Adam so how can a sex act do
[1:09:12] anything but kill you it can't raise you
[1:09:15] up it can't save you alright
[1:09:17] and I'll tell you what what my thought
[1:09:20] on this is and take it for what it is I
[1:09:22] really don't don't bother me now what
[1:09:26] happened that polluted OMA read that
[1:09:38] with me the polluted seed of Adam has
[1:09:43] polluted and absolutely destroyed the
[1:09:46] land do you see any redemption in that
[1:09:54] scene to salvation than that do you know
[1:09:58] the Bible says that and because that he
[1:10:00] has did this the polluted seed of Adam
[1:10:02] God will destroy him if you don't listen
[1:10:06] if you don't get the second Adam inside
[1:10:08] of you to redeem you you'll die go to
[1:10:13] destroy you
[1:10:14] hey manage that alright say man shakes
[1:10:16] out the polluted seed of Adam has
[1:10:21] polluted and absolutely destroyed the
[1:10:25] land
[1:10:26] now Adam was a godly man but the thing
[1:10:29] he did destroyed the whole human race
[1:10:33] amen in his flesh what he did in his
[1:10:36] flesh destroyed the human race no
[1:10:39] salvation in that that's why the second
[1:10:41] Adam had to come in human flesh be born
[1:10:44] a baby by virgin birth
[1:10:47] no sex virgin birth by the spoken word
[1:10:50] of God which is way it should have been
[1:10:52] to start with and then he comes in and
[1:10:54] listen Adams life when Adam died at nine
[1:10:58] hundred and something years old when
[1:10:59] Adam died his theophany went into
[1:11:02] another dimension and it's still there
[1:11:05] as far as I know there's no way that
[1:11:08] even that great theophany of Adam
[1:11:13] there's no way he can come back and come
[1:11:16] into you right or he would be your
[1:11:21] savior we wouldn't have needed the
[1:11:23] second Adam there's only one Savior and
[1:11:26] that's the man that can come out and say
[1:11:29] all power in heaven looks given to me
[1:11:31] and in eleven days in ten days you go
[1:11:33] that upper room and I'm gonna come back
[1:11:36] I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna redeem
[1:11:40] this whole human race that's the atom
[1:11:45] they planted a spiritual seed in the
[1:11:48] womb of your mind
[1:11:53] and new creation was born not of the old
[1:11:59] creation anymore sure we carry the old
[1:12:01] creation right here but inside you're a
[1:12:04] new creation if you're not born again
[1:12:06] you're of the old creation and God will
[1:12:10] destroy them number six
[1:12:18] hey bye all right
[1:12:22] now no one answering one question
[1:12:24] another one is apt to come up boy tell
[1:12:26] me about it
[1:12:27] and people asked me if I felt that way
[1:12:29] what did Adam do for God lays the blame
[1:12:33] on Adam that is simple the Word of God
[1:12:36] is forever settled in heaven let me read
[1:12:39] it one more time let me give you a door
[1:12:40] to quinn quote the George Quinn quote
[1:12:42] says scripture cannot be broken I love
[1:12:48] that scripture cannot be broken the Word
[1:12:53] of God is forever settled in heaven
[1:12:55] before one speck of Stardust was made
[1:12:58] that word God's law was there exactly as
[1:13:03] it's written in our Bible
[1:13:07] now the word teaches us that if a woman
[1:13:10] leaves her husband listen to this now I
[1:13:12] just read this in the Book of Jeremiah
[1:13:14] just read it yesterday morning and
[1:13:19] listen look at me if a woman goes out
[1:13:23] and has relations with another man
[1:13:25] you're not supposed to take her back the
[1:13:29] Bible tells you not to take her back if
[1:13:31] she goes out and pollutes herself and
[1:13:33] has relations with another man you're
[1:13:36] not supposed to take her back and man
[1:13:38] that's what the Bible says but remember
[1:13:41] Adam did so did Christ because you now
[1:13:48] were married to another and we did all
[1:13:50] these horrible things they okay cuz
[1:13:57] remember like I said it's got to be the
[1:13:59] essence it's got to be the continuity of
[1:14:00] the message in the Bible all the way
[1:14:01] from Genesis or revelation called this
[1:14:04] the book of redemption Genesis tells us
[1:14:06] to fall all the way through tells us how
[1:14:10] he's coming back up with me now the word
[1:14:12] teaches us that if a woman leaves her
[1:14:14] husband and goes with another man she is
[1:14:16] an adulteress and it's no longer married
[1:14:19] and the husband is not to take her back
[1:14:21] that word was true in Eden as it was
[1:14:25] true when Moses wrote it in the law you
[1:14:29] st. know Adam Eve Eve was from the Bible
[1:14:33] was written the
[1:14:34] for one speck of Stardust was made God's
[1:14:38] law it was there exactly as it is
[1:14:41] written in our Bible so listen there was
[1:14:46] redemption already written in the Bible
[1:14:49] there was a lamb not for justy but for
[1:14:52] Adam not to take her back that word was
[1:14:59] true in Eden as it was true when Moses
[1:15:01] wrote it in the law the word can't
[1:15:03] change
[1:15:04] let me quote that one more time
[1:15:05] scripture cannot be broken
[1:15:08] alright the word can't change Adam took
[1:15:12] her back he knew exactly what he was
[1:15:15] doing but he did it anyway right she was
[1:15:19] a part of him and he was willing to take
[1:15:22] her responsibility upon himself not the
[1:15:28] act remember it started up here right
[1:15:32] this is the first wound he got to he
[1:15:40] would not let her go so Eve conceived by
[1:15:45] him he knew she would he knew exactly
[1:15:49] what would happen to the human race and
[1:15:51] he sold the human race into sin that he
[1:15:55] might have Eve for he loved her and I'm
[1:15:59] gonna read you a quote in a few minutes
[1:16:00] where brother Brown said God should have
[1:16:04] sent us all to hell but he went to hell
[1:16:07] and got us just like Eve Adam went out
[1:16:11] and got Eve and didn't have sex with her
[1:16:14] to save her I'm gonna tell you that one
[1:16:15] more time please good grief folks this
[1:16:18] is we're way too far up the line for
[1:16:23] that to be anything in our in our
[1:16:25] thinking all right
[1:16:27] and remember truly the two sons that
[1:16:33] were born they were born outside of the
[1:16:35] garden and they both needed a lamb
[1:16:42] if not if we go back to that where Adams
[1:16:45] done what he did to save Eve then it
[1:16:47] would have saved Abel it would have
[1:16:50] saved SAFF that would us know they know
[1:16:53] all needed a lamb to represent the fall
[1:16:56] and the redemption through the Lamb of
[1:16:59] God that was going to take away the sin
[1:17:01] of the world that's what I mean if you
[1:17:03] get the essence of the message folks
[1:17:04] forget I don't say forget the quotes but
[1:17:06] you got to take the essence of this
[1:17:08] message if you keep reading quotes they
[1:17:10] will kill you you will get confused and
[1:17:15] there's no confusion in the Word of God
[1:17:17] and there's no confusion in this message
[1:17:20] it's what man has run it through their
[1:17:22] filter and confused it which is what
[1:17:26] confused the people all right number
[1:17:29] seven we got to keep going we got
[1:17:31] sixteen quotes to read okay
[1:17:34] everybody all right everybody's okay all
[1:17:38] right I'm not trying I'm not trying to
[1:17:39] degrade nobody I'm just gonna tell you
[1:17:41] something one word one word off and
[1:17:45] we're not gonna take a body change I
[1:17:46] contend that we're gonna be that one
[1:17:49] word on and take a body change but we
[1:17:52] got to have this listen if we have this
[1:17:54] thing lined up there's no more fear the
[1:17:58] theory is is whether I'm right in your
[1:18:00] own or whether you're wrong and I'm
[1:18:04] right but when we see the Word of God
[1:18:07] and we all come underneath that word of
[1:18:09] God we see that it's right and the Holy
[1:18:12] Spirit inside of us connects with it and
[1:18:14] says that ain't nothing but the truth I
[1:18:16] just wanna watch what a woman did she
[1:18:19] wasn't him in church he was in her house
[1:18:21] cleaning up her kitchen and the prophet
[1:18:25] of God said something she said that
[1:18:26] ain't nothing but the truth he said God
[1:18:29] heard that and told that woman whatever
[1:18:30] she wanted she could have same way with
[1:18:34] you and I Eve said be it unto me
[1:18:37] according to thy word that's the same
[1:18:38] thing sister heady Rock said being unto
[1:18:40] me according to thy word in other words
[1:18:41] brother Ram Nate you what you said ain't
[1:18:43] never betray and God honored that by
[1:18:46] giving her the what the salvation of her
[1:18:48] two sons
[1:18:48] yond Roxy Avenue Adam and Eve that first
[1:18:51] little sweethearts there in the Garden
[1:18:52] of Eden I see Adam back there
[1:18:54] when he put his arm around his a little
[1:18:55] sweetheart to walk out with her for God
[1:18:58] had condemned them and he started out
[1:19:03] with his arms around his darling Adam
[1:19:05] was not deceived he didn't have to walk
[1:19:08] out but he walked out because he loved
[1:19:11] his wife he walked out with both eyes
[1:19:15] wide open no matter if she had to go to
[1:19:18] torment he'd go with her now I'm gonna
[1:19:22] tell you something rock Tara stop look
[1:19:25] at me remember I talked about filio love
[1:19:27] and agape love
[1:19:28] that's filial love but it turned right
[1:19:32] straight into agape love because listen
[1:19:35] for him to take a woman back that had
[1:19:39] laid with the Beast an animal and he
[1:19:44] knew it he could have had her destroyed
[1:19:47] and made a whole brand-new another one
[1:19:49] but it wouldn't have been him it
[1:19:51] wouldn't have been Adam it'd have been
[1:19:53] something else that okay but he took her
[1:20:01] back because agape love took over
[1:20:04] we're figlio love started agape love
[1:20:07] took over to love because look watch cuz
[1:20:11] look God doesn't love us with figlio
[1:20:13] love God has never loved you with figlio
[1:20:17] life he doesn't know what figlio love
[1:20:21] figlio love come after agape love fell
[1:20:23] down because remember brother Brown said
[1:20:25] it starts with a goofy love figlio love
[1:20:28] lust all he goes all the way names all
[1:20:31] of it right down to the bottom the
[1:20:33] prostitution all that stuff like that
[1:20:35] but it started with a godly love when
[1:20:38] God looked down and seen that love of a
[1:20:41] human being but see remember it was Adam
[1:20:45] I believe it was the inside man that
[1:20:47] Genesis 1:26 man is the one that took
[1:20:51] her back not the flesh guy and I'll
[1:20:54] explain to you in just a minute what I
[1:20:56] think about that it was so cuz remember
[1:20:58] there's no doubt he had intercourse with
[1:21:00] Eve no doubt it's in the Bible but we'll
[1:21:04] look at something just a minute if
[1:21:05] you'll hang with me just a minute
[1:21:07] when God looked down and seeing that
[1:21:09] love of human being was so great that he
[1:21:10] couldn't stand it itself that's right he
[1:21:13] said I'll come and go too and said I'll
[1:21:17] put enmity between her seed and the
[1:21:20] serpent seed then you see four thousand
[1:21:23] years later you continue on and you see
[1:21:27] the second Adam comes but look back
[1:21:31] yonder when Adam was leaving with his
[1:21:32] sweetheart going out under condemnation
[1:21:35] was a shadow of redemption somewhere not
[1:21:40] Redemption a shadow of redemption
[1:21:44] somewhere because there was blood
[1:21:46] running over them
[1:21:48] remember God killed the animals and
[1:21:50] throat the skins then they put the skins
[1:21:52] on all right somewhere there was a
[1:21:55] shadow he knew it and I hear something
[1:21:59] going brother Bram clouds what is it
[1:22:01] it's the old bloody sheepskin beating up
[1:22:03] and down on his leg
[1:22:05] speaking of sometime Wow and I can see
[1:22:12] him going yonder now look this is the
[1:22:13] second Adam now the second Adam going up
[1:22:16] the hills a little spots on his back
[1:22:17] they got bigger and bigger as he walked
[1:22:19] up what is it after a while they got all
[1:22:21] into one spot I hear something beating
[1:22:23] again what is it there goes the second
[1:22:25] Adam now if the first Adam had any
[1:22:29] redemption why do we need a second one
[1:22:33] no more than Jehovah himself who comes
[1:22:37] down and was made flesh to what even to
[1:22:41] go to hell with his sweetheart to redeem
[1:22:44] her back hey man Christ to redeem his
[1:22:49] bride hallelujah he's seen it in Adam
[1:22:52] yonder what a shadow and he comes down
[1:22:56] was made flesh kinfolks with us that he
[1:22:59] might marry the human race to himself
[1:23:03] there he is going under to Calvary that
[1:23:08] Alright married the human race to
[1:23:11] himself so he could be our kinsman
[1:23:15] redeemer number eight what does it take
[1:23:18] to make a Christian life now women must
[1:23:21] bring forth this germ of life hurry man
[1:23:23] together by connection we won't go into
[1:23:25] that because you certainly disagree with
[1:23:26] me now what he's doing is he's talking
[1:23:27] about what happened in the garden
[1:23:29] it wasn't apples they'd taken in the
[1:23:32] Garden of Eden so then when they did let
[1:23:34] it be what it makes he's in Chicago in
[1:23:37] 1957 he's not really in the serpent seed
[1:23:40] all over the place now he's trying to
[1:23:42] kind of you know work his way around it
[1:23:46] so they don't cuz you know what he knows
[1:23:49] they're humans and they'll shut it when
[1:23:50] he says it was sex between even a beast
[1:23:53] they'll go and now I walk out the door
[1:23:56] let he says look so then when they did
[1:23:59] let it be what it may woman sin man
[1:24:02] never said no watch he stops because
[1:24:05] he's wrong I mean man sinned woman never
[1:24:12] sinned the woman was actually deceived
[1:24:16] Adam was not deceived he knowed what he
[1:24:19] was doing Eve actually thought she was
[1:24:22] right she was getting some new light
[1:24:25] that Satan was giving her he's still
[1:24:28] giving her that light but he said stay
[1:24:31] with the Bible that's it but he told her
[1:24:34] now wait God said but he said surely and
[1:24:36] then whatever it was the act was
[1:24:38] committed me we know what that was and
[1:24:41] then she enticed her husband it don't
[1:24:48] look like Adam was over there trying to
[1:24:51] pull Eve in it looks like he was selling
[1:24:53] him the product because she protect
[1:24:57] first then she enticed her husband
[1:25:01] him knowing it was wrong how can you get
[1:25:06] a ride act out something wrong and Adam
[1:25:10] walked out of the Garden of Eden because
[1:25:11] the love of his wife which was a type of
[1:25:16] Christ knowing no sin come down and was
[1:25:19] made sin for his church waltz right out
[1:25:23] knowing what he was doing I have power
[1:25:26] to lay it down or take it up he walked
[1:25:28] out knowing what he was doing and was
[1:25:31] partakers of our transgression
[1:25:33] that he might redeem us back there's
[1:25:36] only one Redeemer folks that's Jesus
[1:25:38] Christ a man not a nutter an atom not a
[1:25:42] first atom the second atom cuz you know
[1:25:45] why you know Wayne could redeem us he
[1:25:47] can come back in us Adam couldn't come
[1:25:50] back in you and me the Lambs and the
[1:25:53] doves and the turtles not couldn't come
[1:25:55] back in to mend you it had to be a man
[1:25:57] and it had to be a supernatural man
[1:25:59] inside that natural man so he could come
[1:26:01] back and what spiritually multiply
[1:26:03] itself then all right that he might
[1:26:07] redeem us about what a beautiful and it
[1:26:09] is it's one of the most beautiful
[1:26:11] pictures in the world is redemption
[1:26:15] number nine thirsting for life now we
[1:26:20] see the different types of life that's
[1:26:22] the reason that this man's born as a
[1:26:24] product of Adam which was a product of
[1:26:27] sin from listening to his wife how you
[1:26:32] gonna get Redemption from that how you
[1:26:35] gonna get salvation from that you can't
[1:26:38] which was a product of sin from
[1:26:41] listening to his wife and the wife was a
[1:26:44] product of sins come from Satan and Adam
[1:26:47] followed his wife out a perfect type of
[1:26:51] Christ going with his bride to take her
[1:26:54] sins as Adam took the sins of Eve and
[1:26:57] left the Garden of Eden not deceived but
[1:27:00] willingly walked out with her so was
[1:27:03] Christ not deceived
[1:27:05] Satan could not deceive him if thou be
[1:27:09] the Son of God did y'all know I didn't
[1:27:12] bring this quote but the three
[1:27:14] temptations in the garden were when
[1:27:16] Jesus came out and went through that 40
[1:27:18] days of temptation the three things that
[1:27:21] he was tempted is the three things that
[1:27:22] she fell from in the garden which is a
[1:27:24] whole other sermon but it's the same
[1:27:26] identical thing the second Adam went
[1:27:28] through the same thing the first item
[1:27:30] went through with temptation of Satan
[1:27:31] pride of life and the other two but
[1:27:35] that's exactly what happened in the
[1:27:36] garden I didn't bring that quote but man
[1:27:38] it was very powerful you can look it up
[1:27:39] yourself you wanted but he deliberately
[1:27:41] walked out and took sin for the church
[1:27:43] he's our sin bearer
[1:27:47] Adam cannot be a sin bearer the sack he
[1:27:52] fell in sin alright next conferences
[1:27:57] with God 1959 God selected a certain
[1:28:03] tree in the Garden of Eden and after he
[1:28:04] had throwed out in the mould ladies
[1:28:05] sheepskins into the behind the bushes he
[1:28:08] called Adam and Eve they made a
[1:28:09] conference talk to over made a remedy
[1:28:11] for this horrible thing that his
[1:28:13] children had done God's conference and
[1:28:16] there was a decision made always at a
[1:28:18] conference there's a decision and God
[1:28:20] made a decision that because that Eve
[1:28:22] had when he held her at the witness
[1:28:24] stand because she took life from the
[1:28:27] world she'd have to bring life into the
[1:28:30] world and to Adam in to the serpent oh
[1:28:34] of course that being the head of the
[1:28:37] race all the race under it fell with
[1:28:42] Adam there's no salvation in any act of
[1:28:50] Adam that's what caused the fall number
[1:28:54] 11 and everybody know you ought to be
[1:28:59] able to quote this now notice making it
[1:29:02] known cross the mystery of God revealed
[1:29:03] and I would tell you something else you
[1:29:06] may not think this is from God but I'll
[1:29:09] promise you for three days I've been
[1:29:10] looking up quotes and all I done was is
[1:29:13] when I'd get a thought I'd find a quote
[1:29:14] and I'd put it in here I never had to
[1:29:16] move these quotes number one state
[1:29:20] number one number two state number two
[1:29:21] now I interjected that first one because
[1:29:23] of the one word off but every one of
[1:29:25] them was exactly the way I moved them
[1:29:26] from the message right into this I never
[1:29:28] had to move them around or cut and paste
[1:29:30] they came right together everyone I'm
[1:29:33] right in line all right now notice make
[1:29:36] it known hat and my there's just so much
[1:29:38] here we could just keep on going notice
[1:29:40] the tree of Christ's body in the garden
[1:29:42] making his mystery known to this bride
[1:29:44] tree watch redeemed and Eve again man
[1:29:50] and woman which are one made out of the
[1:29:53] same blood and the same spirit and
[1:29:54] everything else by Christ the second
[1:29:57] Adam you believe he was congregation
[1:30:00] says
[1:30:01] I'm going back home to Eden with his
[1:30:04] fallen wife redeemed back home again
[1:30:08] that's Christ in the church today taking
[1:30:13] his wife back sees a three-fold mystery
[1:30:17] now God manifested in Christ Christ
[1:30:19] manifested in the church all together to
[1:30:22] bring back the original item there was
[1:30:26] nothing wrong with the original Adam the
[1:30:29] original all right let's go to number 12
[1:30:35] man running from the presence of the
[1:30:38] Lord it's always been that it's been in
[1:30:42] man has shirked and went away from God
[1:30:44] ever since Adam in the Garden of Eden
[1:30:45] when Adam was in the Garden of Eden when
[1:30:48] he come to the responsibility to make
[1:30:50] his choice would he stay with God or go
[1:30:54] with his wife he had to make that rest
[1:30:57] he had to make that the the
[1:30:59] responsibility was up to him he either
[1:31:03] had to take what his wife said or what
[1:31:06] God said and when he chose to go the way
[1:31:10] of his wife and when he did that then he
[1:31:13] lost his original condition and brought
[1:31:17] the whole world subject to death when he
[1:31:24] had to take the responsibility or either
[1:31:27] accepting a new light that his wife had
[1:31:30] found which was contrary oh god think of
[1:31:34] it God only gave them about eight or ten
[1:31:36] words to keep there was no Bible there
[1:31:38] was no 1,100 sermons there was no dry
[1:31:40] moody there was no he gave them ten
[1:31:43] words but of that tree thou shalt not
[1:31:46] eat that's all they had to keep and even
[1:31:49] with that much word they broke it
[1:31:51] it says they broke it then Adam had to
[1:31:57] face up will I will I do as my wife had
[1:32:01] said do he listened to his wife or shall
[1:32:09] I do what God said do and he walked out
[1:32:13] with his eyes Oh
[1:32:14] but he had to take the responsibility
[1:32:18] that throwed the whole human race unto
[1:32:23] death now find me any life in that there
[1:32:27] is none alright number thirteen power of
[1:32:31] transformation now we find out that this
[1:32:34] fella found even the Garden of Eden this
[1:32:36] young woman that knowed no sin know not
[1:32:39] what her nakedness was and he knew what
[1:32:42] Satan knew he was smart subtle wise and
[1:32:46] he told her the seed the fruit was
[1:32:47] pleasant and it was desirable and when
[1:32:49] he lived with her that morning and then
[1:32:51] see then the afternoon she persuaded
[1:32:53] Adam it don't tell it that don't tell me
[1:32:59] that that Adam quickly took her in and
[1:33:01] done what he did to her it shows me that
[1:33:05] she persuaded Adam to do the same thing
[1:33:10] telling him what it was and then Adam
[1:33:14] deliberately knowing he not ought not to
[1:33:16] have done it walked out with his wife
[1:33:19] and did this act which finally would
[1:33:23] have come to it anyhow but see it had to
[1:33:26] be that way the wisdom of God cuz this
[1:33:29] then that displays his attribute to be a
[1:33:31] savior a father and a healer God knew
[1:33:35] when he put Adam and Eve in human flesh
[1:33:37] they would fall but when they fell he
[1:33:40] had already made weight away from to get
[1:33:41] back but to be a complete to be God he
[1:33:45] had to be a savior father and a healer
[1:33:46] he couldn't be that in the Garden of
[1:33:48] Eden before the fall amen
[1:33:50] but now remember he didn't make him do
[1:33:53] it either he didn't entice them in any
[1:33:57] way he gave them total free moral agency
[1:33:59] to do what they were doing alright
[1:34:02] number fourteen and then we'll get to
[1:34:09] number 15 which is what we're what we're
[1:34:12] looking at here we're not doing to that
[1:34:13] layout of Stan church age quick look
[1:34:15] these scriptures would involved the Lord
[1:34:17] Jesus now this is no way out of staying
[1:34:18] church age in Matthew 4 where in Jesus
[1:34:20] is tempted of the devil he overcame the
[1:34:22] personal temptation of Satan by the word
[1:34:24] and by the word only oh this is that
[1:34:27] right here and he
[1:34:28] the three major trials that caught that
[1:34:30] correspondent exactly to the temptation
[1:34:33] of the Garden of Eden you ever thought
[1:34:35] about that
[1:34:36] you probably rated it quote a hundred
[1:34:38] times but whatever Satan tempted Adam at
[1:34:42] the first whiff he attempted the second
[1:34:45] Adam with the same thing what three
[1:34:47] things the lust of the flesh the lust of
[1:34:50] the eye and the pride of life Jesus
[1:34:53] overcame by the word he fell to the
[1:34:56] personal temptation of Satan by failing
[1:34:59] to use the word Adam fell in direct
[1:35:03] disobedience to the word but Jesus
[1:35:08] overcame by the word and right now let
[1:35:10] me say this is the only way to be an
[1:35:12] overcomer also it is the only way that
[1:35:15] you can know if you are overcoming
[1:35:17] because that word can't fail alright now
[1:35:22] here's the quote that everybody that
[1:35:24] they use to base their and now let me
[1:35:30] tell you but don't look before we get
[1:35:31] started
[1:35:32] George Quinn quote scripture cannot be
[1:35:36] broken
[1:35:38] brother Brown can't say one thing that
[1:35:40] the scripture didn't say and the
[1:35:42] scripture says in Adam all die alright
[1:35:45] and then we're going to read now we're
[1:35:47] going to also read in Romans and we'll
[1:35:48] will cut this thing off in the book of
[1:35:50] Romans 5 verse 14 explains every bit of
[1:35:52] it
[1:35:53] knight-errant church age CUC death or
[1:35:56] organization came into the church died
[1:35:57] or to make it plainer death became a
[1:35:59] resident we're in shortly before only
[1:36:02] life reigned as the original eve brought
[1:36:05] death to mankind
[1:36:06] so now organization has brought death
[1:36:09] for organization is the product of the
[1:36:12] double corrupters Nicollet ism and
[1:36:14] Balaam ism propagated by the prophetess
[1:36:17] Jezebel now Eve should have been burned
[1:36:20] along with the serpent for their awful
[1:36:23] deed but Adam intervened now remember
[1:36:27] don't forget all them 14 quotes I just
[1:36:31] read you and one more quote I'm gonna
[1:36:35] tell you scripture cannot be broken
[1:36:38] right
[1:36:40] in Adam all die now Eve should have been
[1:36:46] burnt alone with the serpent for their
[1:36:48] awful deed but Adam intervened taking
[1:36:51] her quickly to himself so that she was
[1:36:53] saved you know what she got saved from
[1:36:54] it didn't save her from sinning she died
[1:36:59] right what did save her from she died
[1:37:02] anyway it saved her from God killing her
[1:37:05] right then but when this satanic
[1:37:11] religion has gone the full course of the
[1:37:13] ages there will be no one to intervene
[1:37:15] in other words Christ has already took
[1:37:17] his bride and he's not intervening
[1:37:19] anymore she will be burned with her
[1:37:21] seducer for the and her children
[1:37:23] and the Anna Constance Satan will all
[1:37:24] find their place in the lake of fire so
[1:37:26] let me read that again
[1:37:27] Adam intervene now don't forget them 14
[1:37:30] quotes we had before where Eve enticed
[1:37:34] Adam Eve sold Adam the product Adam
[1:37:39] without with her took her sin on his
[1:37:42] self so that's not talking about what
[1:37:45] that brother is talking about or those
[1:37:47] brothers are talking about that has
[1:37:49] nothing to do with a natural seed no way
[1:37:54] go scripture cannot be broken in Adam
[1:37:59] all died an Adam seed polluted the earth
[1:38:03] I just read you that quote to everybody
[1:38:07] understand that so how could us that's
[1:38:11] why I don't understand it's just not
[1:38:13] common sense common sense will tell you
[1:38:16] that the act that we were born under
[1:38:19] it's what's killing us the natural man
[1:38:24] and woman getting together and having
[1:38:25] you y'all are getting older and so am I
[1:38:29] because of natural seed
[1:38:34] we're not natural seed children anymore
[1:38:37] we're already here but we're supposed to
[1:38:41] be spiritual born seed brother Brown
[1:38:43] preach the spoken words original seed he
[1:38:45] spent six hours six hours trying to
[1:38:49] explain that the spoken word is theory
[1:38:54] you know seed man seed is what got it
[1:38:57] all in trouble and the parole beast was
[1:39:04] just a vessel he had though he was he
[1:39:08] was just he was just incarnated by the
[1:39:10] devil and the devil took over and well I
[1:39:13] don't have to explain that to the adults
[1:39:15] of what he told Eve he said hey Eva I
[1:39:20] think I was let me just go go through
[1:39:24] this okay
[1:39:25] the Beast says Eve I was here before you
[1:39:30] were creative evolution so there was a
[1:39:35] beast there and then then in the sixth
[1:39:38] day because the Beast was created on the
[1:39:40] fifth day all the animals was created on
[1:39:44] the fifth day six day man was created
[1:39:46] right so he said hey Eve I got here for
[1:39:49] you did and said I remember God saying
[1:39:53] something now this is Satan talking
[1:39:55] through the beefs he's got to be slick
[1:39:57] he can't just tell her what he wants to
[1:39:59] do to her you understand what I mean
[1:40:01] she's got to first receive it up here
[1:40:03] amen
[1:40:04] so he tells her he says hey he said I
[1:40:08] remember didn't God tell you the
[1:40:10] multiply and replenish the earth because
[1:40:12] he Satan was standing right there when
[1:40:14] that Genesis 1:26 man was spoke right he
[1:40:20] was standing right there and he's heard
[1:40:22] God say let us make man in our own image
[1:40:25] male and female created he them multiply
[1:40:29] and replenish the earth then the beast
[1:40:36] said men missus beast we making kids all
[1:40:43] right look at the little look at the
[1:40:45] little lambs they had little lambs
[1:40:46] running all over the place there's a
[1:40:48] little sheep running all over the place
[1:40:50] there's little cows running all over the
[1:40:51] place he said all I see is you and Adam
[1:40:55] what's that I'm not doing because you
[1:40:57] know he had to turn it towards Adam
[1:40:58] fault he had to say well now wait a
[1:41:02] minute
[1:41:02] because remember brother Brad said Eve
[1:41:04] was God and Eve got a new revelation she
[1:41:07] get it from Adam she got it from the
[1:41:10] devil and she presented it to Adam after
[1:41:13] she did what she did so here so here
[1:41:15] Satan and the Beast is I can help you do
[1:41:17] that comes remember brother Brown said
[1:41:19] Satan knew the principles of life he
[1:41:22] knew that in creative evolution that
[1:41:25] that beast could coincide with the man
[1:41:28] or coincide with the Beast he knew that
[1:41:31] why how did he know how how do you know
[1:41:34] to go straight into that so that was the
[1:41:36] closest thing to the human right and it
[1:41:39] would commingle and and remember Satan
[1:41:42] don't have a seat say it's not a creator
[1:41:45] Satan had to borrow the Beast the body
[1:41:50] of the Beast to do the act talked even
[1:41:53] to doing the act and then that happens
[1:41:55] thereby okay without me he just kept
[1:41:57] going I believe maybe it was days months
[1:41:59] years it could've been hundreds of years
[1:42:00] it really didn't matter
[1:42:01] there was not any time before the fall
[1:42:03] so he just kept talking to her and
[1:42:06] finally she said okay remember what said
[1:42:09] she took them presented the product to
[1:42:11] Adam when the product was Adam me and
[1:42:16] this beast here have been talking got
[1:42:19] together and this is what we've done now
[1:42:21] listen Adam wasn't an idiot Adam was the
[1:42:26] god of the earth thereby all right with
[1:42:28] that Adam was the god of the earth Adam
[1:42:31] knew the principles of life also he knew
[1:42:34] what would happen cuz he would watch you
[1:42:37] could see the whole world repopulating
[1:42:39] by ear course but that was put for God
[1:42:43] to give to the animals not to the man
[1:42:48] because we were not supposed to
[1:42:50] reproduce sexually we were supposed to
[1:42:53] reproduce by the spoken word of God Amen
[1:42:56] because the spoken word is original seed
[1:42:59] why did he spend six hours preaching
[1:43:02] that sermon she didn't take the spoken
[1:43:07] word
[1:43:09] she took Satan's idea and committed the
[1:43:15] act first in her brain comes remember
[1:43:17] Mary had to do the same thing she had to
[1:43:20] receive it up here remember
[1:43:21] she said oh how I do this not knowing
[1:43:22] the man it was up here how can I do
[1:43:26] that's not knowing the man Holy Ghost
[1:43:30] said don't you worry her Gabriel said
[1:43:32] don't you worry said the Holy Ghost was
[1:43:34] gonna overshadow you and said what's
[1:43:37] gonna be born in you as Isaiah 9:6 and
[1:43:41] when he said that she said be it unto me
[1:43:43] according to thy word and from her
[1:43:45] spoken word and from the Holy Ghost
[1:43:47] doing what he did
[1:43:49] she received the seed without any
[1:43:52] sensation so he could be our brother
[1:43:56] now listen on the day of Pentecost when
[1:44:00] 120 lo jesus' were born they weren't
[1:44:03] born sexually they were already born
[1:44:06] they were born dead Jesus kept telling
[1:44:10] them unless you believe I am he you'll
[1:44:14] die in your sins he's the only one that
[1:44:18] could come out of the grave go over into
[1:44:20] another dimension come back into this
[1:44:22] dimension and divide yourself out to
[1:44:26] redeem man starting with 120 and going
[1:44:30] to 3,000 and now look at us we were all
[1:44:34] born again by the incorruptible Word of
[1:44:38] God in other words the incorruptible
[1:44:40] seed Word of God a man the son of man
[1:44:44] went and sowed seed he didn't sow
[1:44:45] natural seed he sowed spiritual seed
[1:44:48] because you and I are now spiritual
[1:44:51] children by the union of God and us
[1:44:54] together made a spiritual union he
[1:44:56] planted the seed Word of God in my
[1:44:59] listen you're receiving it now you're
[1:45:03] receiving the seed Word of God now not
[1:45:06] just me standing up here but when you
[1:45:08] read the Bible when you get a revelation
[1:45:09] that's the way it's supposed to be and
[1:45:12] that's God making love to you not the
[1:45:13] other way that's a perversion re or a
[1:45:16] shadow of what God is trying to do with
[1:45:21] us so it can't be Adam planting his
[1:45:26] natural seed no he said God I'll take
[1:45:30] her sin I'll cover her
[1:45:34] because I know what she did and I know
[1:45:37] who did it and you know what I'd have
[1:45:39] said it I just said God you already took
[1:45:40] care of that part remember he took the
[1:45:43] beast and he said on your on your belly
[1:45:44] he took that completely out of the
[1:45:46] picture but then God said he said I'll
[1:45:49] put enmity between die see talk about
[1:45:54] Satan in the state of the woman and a
[1:45:57] woman doesn't have see she received a
[1:46:00] spiritual seed word and that's what
[1:46:03] saves us folks is not a natural exactly
[1:46:07] what saves us is the spiritual word of
[1:46:10] God entering in the womb of our mind a
[1:46:13] man not a natural act all right now let
[1:46:19] me cover this let's read this right here
[1:46:21] real quick watch this we okay ten
[1:46:25] minutes till now we'll close in just a
[1:46:27] minute
[1:46:29] Smyrna church age I'm gonna give you my
[1:46:31] give me my thought on this but watch
[1:46:33] Smyrna church age not read the church
[1:46:36] age book a hundred times and I've never
[1:46:37] read this have you ever done that once
[1:46:41] in a while once in the morning while in
[1:46:42] the afternoon
[1:46:43] man Adam took life and turned it into
[1:46:46] death but this man Jesus took death and
[1:46:50] turned it into life Adam took innocence
[1:46:53] and turned it into guilt this one took
[1:46:55] guilt and turned it into righteousness
[1:46:58] Adam took a paradise and turned it into
[1:47:01] a waste howling wilderness but this one
[1:47:06] is coming back to turn and earth rocking
[1:47:09] and reeling with destruction into
[1:47:10] another Eden Adam took a life of
[1:47:14] fellowship and joy with God and turned
[1:47:17] it into a desert of spiritual darkness
[1:47:19] that brought forth all sin moral decay
[1:47:23] pain suffering delusion and corruption
[1:47:27] that wars within the souls of men but
[1:47:31] this one from all the tragic death and
[1:47:34] decoration that filled mankind brought
[1:47:37] forth the life of righteousness and
[1:47:39] beauty so that as sin once reigned unto
[1:47:42] death even so men now reign and
[1:47:45] righteousness by one
[1:47:48] across Jesus and not as the offense was
[1:47:52] though terrible indeed it was but now
[1:47:55] much more as his gift undo eternal life
[1:47:59] now do you know that he's quoting
[1:48:01] scripture that is exactly romans 5:14
[1:48:05] turn it over
[1:48:08] let's read romans 5:14 he's actually
[1:48:12] read he read that whole scripture but he
[1:48:14] interpolated nevertheless death reigned
[1:48:17] from Adam to Moses even over them that
[1:48:21] had not sinned after the similitude of
[1:48:23] Adam's transgression who is the figure
[1:48:25] of him that was to come in other words
[1:48:28] Adam remember brother Brahim said well
[1:48:30] Adam and Eve caused all this he said no
[1:48:32] they cause there's you cause yours I who
[1:48:36] is the figure of him that was to come
[1:48:37] cross Jesus but not as the offence so
[1:48:40] also is the free gift for if through the
[1:48:43] offence of one many be dead what is the
[1:48:46] offence Adam and Eve or Adam selling the
[1:48:50] human race really much more the grace of
[1:48:53] God and the gift by grace which is by
[1:48:56] one man Jesus Christ has abounded unto
[1:48:59] many and not as it was by one that
[1:49:03] sinned so is the gift what Christ came
[1:49:07] he income sinful he came to take our sin
[1:49:10] for the judgment was by one to
[1:49:13] condemnation Adam but the free gift is
[1:49:16] of many offenses under justification for
[1:49:20] if by one man's offense death reigned by
[1:49:22] one Adam
[1:49:24] much more they which receive abundance
[1:49:26] of grace and of the gift of
[1:49:28] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[1:49:31] Jesus Christ that's your answer right
[1:49:36] there Adam turn this thing upside down
[1:49:42] he had no ability to bring you back so
[1:49:48] he went out with her he had no way to
[1:49:51] redeem Eve and when brother Branham
[1:49:53] talks about being saved that don't mean
[1:49:55] saved like saved you understand what I
[1:49:57] mean no that means that it kept God from
[1:50:00] killing her because same way evening
[1:50:02] flames that Adam I mean that God should
[1:50:04] have killed Sarah God should have killed
[1:50:07] Sarah for laughing in her heart but but
[1:50:10] God brother Brown said God couldn't get
[1:50:11] to Sarah because of Adam I mean because
[1:50:14] of Abraham but God couldn't get to Eve
[1:50:18] because the first Adam said I'll take
[1:50:23] her now you say well you know he didn't
[1:50:26] he did commit the act
[1:50:28] yeah he did you wanna know my thoughts
[1:50:31] on it just for weak low you mow us
[1:50:33] around and run it through your holy
[1:50:34] ghost filter it's absolutely true that
[1:50:38] Adam had relations with Eve brother
[1:50:40] Brown said the Beast that morning and
[1:50:43] Adam shortly after that now we
[1:50:47] understand that that case happened back
[1:50:49] in the 60s in California the same way
[1:50:52] she that's lady had relations with her
[1:50:54] husband in the morning and had relations
[1:50:56] with the gardener a black guy in the
[1:50:57] afternoon all right now I don't know the
[1:51:00] science of all this but you know one
[1:51:01] thing's for sure sisters that when you
[1:51:04] do have relations and you start having a
[1:51:05] child your wound closes right you womb
[1:51:10] closes up and you can't receive anything
[1:51:13] else to make another baby until that
[1:51:15] nine months is over is everybody okay
[1:51:16] with that I know you might have to
[1:51:18] explain this to your kids but you know
[1:51:19] what they got to know it sometime
[1:51:21] okay so adamant what did Adam do Adam
[1:51:26] y'all quit laughing
[1:51:27] so Adam Zach so Adam saw what he Eve had
[1:51:33] done
[1:51:34] he saw what he had done he could not
[1:51:38] reverse that because he's not that kind
[1:51:40] of a guy he's not God he yes he could
[1:51:43] have killed her but a godly love took
[1:51:46] over and said even though she laid with
[1:51:49] the Beast she's me she's not another
[1:51:52] woman she's me
[1:51:54] she is me made manifest in another form
[1:51:57] called a woman water we will cry we are
[1:52:00] Christ made manifest in another form
[1:52:04] called a bride hey man where Christ made
[1:52:08] manifest and listen if Adam hadn't done
[1:52:13] what he done that whoo
[1:52:15] closed up and you would have only had
[1:52:19] Cain's lineage and then so that's why
[1:52:27] Adam did what he did he understood that
[1:52:30] if he didn't do something he wouldn't
[1:52:33] have a lineage because it is a natural
[1:52:36] lineage it does start a natural lineage
[1:52:38] Adam begot this one and Seth but I'm
[1:52:41] yeah I forgot this one and this one we
[1:52:42] got down there would have been no
[1:52:44] lineage and you know what there would
[1:52:48] have been no way to rock the Bible I
[1:52:53] know you're looking at me a little funny
[1:52:55] but there'd be no way to rock the Bible
[1:52:57] the way it was already written except
[1:53:00] Adam did what he did to raise up a
[1:53:04] natural seed that would have a chance
[1:53:08] that would have a chance to meet that
[1:53:12] Redeemer one day there was a not a
[1:53:16] better job Isaiah Jeremiah there would
[1:53:20] have not been those great prophets had
[1:53:23] Adam not done what he did so you know
[1:53:25] what what he did killed Eve killed him
[1:53:28] too
[1:53:29] but he preserved the natural race so
[1:53:31] that God could hey he was using the mind
[1:53:34] of Christ he did not lose the mind of
[1:53:37] Christ he still was thinking like God
[1:53:40] hallelujah he still was thinking like
[1:53:43] done I can't save them naturally or
[1:53:46] spiritually but I'm sure try to save
[1:53:49] them and put some people on this earth
[1:53:51] and let God did I can't that I can't
[1:53:55] fellowship with no more because God
[1:53:57] running my other garden he lost his
[1:54:00] fellowship God couldn't come down in the
[1:54:02] cool of the day but but genesis 3:15 God
[1:54:08] stood there and said Adam you can't do
[1:54:10] nothing about this but I will I will
[1:54:15] I'll not just bruised a hill I'll cut
[1:54:19] his head off I'll bruise I'll come down
[1:54:23] and come basically the same way that you
[1:54:27] come I mean that your children are
[1:54:29] coming
[1:54:29] but I'm gonna come the sinless one I'm
[1:54:33] gonna come and I'm gonna redeem that's
[1:54:36] what job job would have never been able
[1:54:38] to say I know my Redeemer liveth if Adam
[1:54:41] had not heard Lee he didn't wait for
[1:54:44] five days to take Evy couldn't've
[1:54:46] because her woman would have closed up
[1:54:48] you understand I'm talking natural so
[1:54:50] Adam knew folks he still had the mind of
[1:54:53] God we think he's a bumbling idiot after
[1:54:55] the fall he's not do you know one
[1:54:58] thing's for sure he had to be the doctor
[1:55:01] the pharmacist they wasn't but just a
[1:55:07] few people on earth
[1:55:08] a man he didn't lose his godlike quality
[1:55:13] I don't think he did he could remember
[1:55:18] so he did what he did not to save Eve
[1:55:22] but to save a lineage that had a chance
[1:55:27] because he couldn't go take her and go
[1:55:30] back in the Garden of Eden only God only
[1:55:34] the Redeemer they hung on Calvary could
[1:55:38] take us back to the Garden of Eden by
[1:55:41] what planting a spiritual seed and
[1:55:45] changing us and multiplying us the way
[1:55:49] it should have been had there not been a
[1:55:51] fall Oh Satan you just I'm sorry son I'm
[1:55:54] sorry you cannot and will not win
[1:56:00] you can pervert all you want to pervert
[1:56:03] Satan but they'll come a group of people
[1:56:09] one more time scripture cannot be broken
[1:56:13] in Adam in the first Adam all done but
[1:56:19] in the second Adam by spiritual
[1:56:22] multiplication when you talk about seed
[1:56:26] and talk about God God's seed is only
[1:56:29] his word
[1:56:33] this is the seed of God because this is
[1:56:37] where you get your new birth from is
[1:56:39] from this right here and the new birth
[1:56:42] is what God planning a spiritual seed in
[1:56:45] the womb of your mind and you say be it
[1:56:50] unto me according to thy word let's
[1:56:54] stand our feet when God came when God
[1:57:03] came down and Jesus was on that River
[1:57:07] there was a voice said this is my
[1:57:11] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[1:57:14] he had waited 4,000 years to be able to
[1:57:19] say that because he was in Adam but he
[1:57:23] was in no one else because remember even
[1:57:26] the spiritual womb was closed until he
[1:57:31] came on earth and on the day of
[1:57:33] Pentecost there was 120 spiritual wounds
[1:57:36] opened up and God came down and settled
[1:57:39] down because Paul says we have the mind
[1:57:42] of Christ that's what comes to you in
[1:57:44] your birthday night and I don't say this
[1:57:46] to belittle no one but you can't you
[1:57:49] can't run what was preached through my
[1:57:51] filter and get the right answer get that
[1:57:53] answer but you can run it see you got to
[1:57:56] take it back to the Word of God the Word
[1:57:58] of God cannot fail will not fail and
[1:58:01] there's no way that it can be broken it
[1:58:08] has to come to pass somebody preach that
[1:58:11] soon they'll bleed it has to come to
[1:58:14] pass because scripture cannot be broken

[1:58:19] need tonight by your head if you have a
[1:58:22] need tonight just raise up your hand God
