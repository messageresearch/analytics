[30:30] unchangeable amen what this unchangeable
[30:33] this in irrefutable truth am when we
[30:37] come into contact with this unchangeable

[31:12] be changed amen he said when we come in
[31:15] contact there is no middle ground amen
[31:20] hallelujah there's no middle ground when
[31:22] we come into contact with there's no

[31:26] theend
[31:27] uh Mir Rocky we either believe in him or
[31:31] we don't that's right amen can you
[31:33] imagine that here was that young guy in
[31:36] the Bible the Rich Young Ruler they call
[31:39] him he came in contact amen oh he might
[31:42] have seen cuz later on he tell we we'll
[31:45] get to that let me I'll just jump ahead
[31:47] of myself but he came in contact oh
[31:50] there was me he probably been to church
[31:52] before cuz he said to Jesus that he kept
[31:54] all the Commandments from his youth he
[31:56] was brought taught right amen had a nice
[31:59] family Sister Jude had a nice mom and
[32:01] dad that taught him right took him to
[32:04] Sunday school and all that and but there
[32:06] was still something missing something
[32:08] lacking and when he came in contact with
[32:11] This Man Called Jesus he knew there was
[32:13] something different about him it wasn't
[32:16] just any runof-the-mill preachers that
[32:18] he had seen right there was something
[32:20] different why because he came in contact
[32:23] with irrefutable truth unchangeable
[32:26] truth right and then he had to make a
[32:28] decision amen amen cuz the Bible says he
[32:33] ran amen and said good Master there must
[32:37] have been something pulling at him Amen
[32:40] brother dick cuz he ran the scripture
[32:41] says and the Bible says he ran and said
[32:44] good Master what must I do to be saved
[32:47] amen what must I do amen he wanted
[32:50] brother Ryan he wanted to know amen
[32:52] there was something amen he came into
[32:54] contact with this irreputable truth
[32:57] truth amen and something took place only
[32:59] something happened and he said what can
[33:01] I what must I do and when Jesus told him
[33:04] said keep all the Commandments he said I
[33:06] kept these from all my you but God but
[33:09] Jesus being that God Prophet looked into
[33:11] his life and said you lack one thing he
[33:13] said go and sell all th has and give to
[33:16] the poor and come and take up your cross
[33:19] and follow me and you'll have Treasures
[33:21] in glory amen you have Treasures in
[33:23] Heaven but something happened amen he
[33:25] could not am lay aside amen that weight
[33:29] that was tendering him amen even though
[33:32] he came in contact with
[33:34] it think about it this morning amen when
[33:38] we come in contact and we realize that
[33:41] this is the truth amen that this word of
[33:43] God Amen is irrefutable what are we
[33:46] going to do that's right that's right
[33:48] amen that's right what are me and you
[33:50] going to do amen amen amen oh he had to
[33:55] build bigger barns
[33:57] amen cuz he kept on but later we find
[34:00] out his
[34:01] identification was that the scripture
[34:03] says he lifted up his eyes and hell and
[34:05] cried being in torment why because
[34:08] instead amen he could not he could not
[34:10] Str the offence he can say well and I
[34:12] don't know if the Lord would have made
[34:14] him give up all that maybe the Lord just
[34:15] wanted to see where his heart was amen
[34:18] see where his motives was see what his
[34:20] objective was amen oh I hope our heart
[34:23] is right this morning I hope our motives
[34:25] is right this morning
[34:27] rejected of right are right this morning
[34:30] Lord amen bless hallelujah amen and he
[34:34] couldn't stradle the fence no more amen
[34:37] he couldn't stand the he couldn't stand
[34:38] neutral no more he had to make up in his
[34:41] mind this is either the truth and I'm
[34:42] going to live it amen I'm going to serve
[34:45] him or this is not the truth and I'm
[34:46] going to walk away from it and he walked
[34:49] away from it God help us this morning
[34:52] that's
[34:53] right amen amen help us this morning
[34:57] right amen see whenever truth is
[35:00] presented to a person they produce one
[35:04] of two

[35:37] going to lay everything aside I'm going
[35:39] to take up my cross and I'm going to
[35:41] fall this cuz I know there's something
[35:42] in here are pulling me toward death amen
