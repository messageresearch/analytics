========================================

um let's just go to the Lord in pray before we get into our study Lord we just ask Lord that you'll be with us today Lord God that you'll Lord just that that the atmosphere of the service and our hearts would be just set just right Lord to receive what you have in store for us today Lord and you will give us abundantly the things we have need of Lord we pray in your name amen so um before we get into the kind of the study I just wanted to this is kind of the theme of the what I've what I've been thinking on as I meditate on some of these scriptures this this quote where brother R said give him your best give him everything you got your life your soul your being your time all that you have give to him and I think I think that really you know in this day that we're living in it seems like the the devil robs you of of the time he's he's um trying to make you work as hard as you can and and before long everything just starts slipping away and you begin to forget what's what really important and you know this this day when we when we come together on Sundays this day is set aside during the week for us to really give everything we've got to the service and come expecting to receive something that uh it just kind of embodies what this quote means give him your best to come expecting to receive from God and come expecting to give everything I got come expecting to to to set my mind in my thoughts and everything in order to receive for what God has for us cuz we're not coming to hear from man or anything like that but we're coming to hear from the word of God and Christ is the word so that's why in Hebrews 13:7 it says remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation and we kind of went through kind of a little study on the fivefold ministry but you know in line with that that thought of giving your best you know kind of think think about that as we kind of study these things out because I wanted to I wanted to kind of talk about how God has given us his best in the in the fivefold ministry he's given and of that he requires that the five-fold ministry give them give their best and they're giving their best and so then he requires you to give your best the fivefold ministry and so let's look at what the the requirements of the fold ministry as we meditating on those thoughts that that they're giving their best to live a life separated from the world to give everything they've got and then that God expects us in turn to give our best because we're remember them which have the rule over you and as we we study this out it's not the men that have rule over us but it's the word that's claiming Our Lives the word that they're preaching the word that they're representing like in the in the New Testament that scripture that says that that when you speak speak as of the Oracles of God that you're actually speaking as a representation of the word that's coming straight from the Throne of of God so brother Ram said and and how in in several quotes he said how do I know if I'm called to preach he said I watch the nature of the person and see what kind of a gift they're professing cuz the nature of that person will slot them right into where they're supposed to go and he said your position is usually known whether you can do it or not of course there's a lot summed up in that it doesn't mean just you can get up behind the pulpit and and and not pass out from from fear or whatever but it means that you can actually be profitable in your in your life and your and and you can actually speed something that will help speak by Revelation something that will help somebody um pull them out of their predicament of sin and and and and begin to change their life and be effectual on them so we're again we're talking about we're going to give our best so brother R said or or Paul actually laid out these requirements for a minister that I've just kind of summed up here and I'm just going to skim through them that a Minister's got to be above reproach and as we as we as we look through these requirements I want to kind of frame it up with something brother brother Dale actually told me years ago that you actually grow into your ministry the same way the same way that you grow as a newborn believer you start out with some there's some fuzzy spots in your life that you grow into immaturity the same thing with the minister there might be some fuzzy spots where maybe maybe your marriage ain't quite the way it needs to be maybe your life ain't quite or or the your your children aren't behaving the right thing but things maybe one day just something something really nails down okay if I'm going to preach this gospel we're going to straighten things up and so you grow into it and so let's not just boot somebody out because maybe they don't live exactly the way that we think they do but on the other hand a minister we're we're we're supposed to be striving striving for excellence and why are all these requirements here because because people are looking at us so Paul Paul laid out these requirements to Timothy he said you got to be above reproach above reproach faithful in marriage temperate self-controlled respectable hospitable and above all I I'll say above all able to teach cuz if you can't proclaim the word then that kind of defeats the whole purpose of preaching and he'd say not given to drunkenness or violence gentle and Peaceable not a lover of money uh is that isn't that true that we're not here for money I was reading out brother Bram said that uh brother brandham John Wesley gave 90% of everything he got to his ties brother brandham gave 90% I found a quote where he said he gave 90% another place brother Adam said I I want to live as poor as the people I'm preaching to so it wasn't about money you're not a lover of money when you when you do this and I I I meditate sometimes on the fact that I really don't know how traveling preachers that do it full-time can subsist on on the money I don't know how it even works because it's not you you're not you you you start preaching this gospel you're not going to you're not going to get money much less anyway managing your family well not a recent convert and good reputation outside of the church but now brother Bram said I can he said we we think about all the best class but I just want to sum it up what's the requirement to be able to preach the gospel we we just think about all the best best class a minister must be a student he must be this that or the other to me he must be the Bible requirement he's got to be filled with the Holy Ghost that's the main thing and Jehovah Gyra brother said I don't care if you don't know his ABCs or split peas from coffee let me tell you brother as long as he knows Jesus Christ he may talk through his nose and holler hit and hate but as long as he's got god with him something will happen in your church I'll tell you that I'd rather have that than all the phds and everything else that's psychology I want to know God and the power of his resurrection so there's the requirement for a minister to have known God in the power of his resurrection and then despite all maybe the lackings and things of his his education and all that kind of background but yet he knows God and he's able to to to Proclaim it in a in in the power so remember them which have the rule over you I I I was reading uh we were uh my wife and I were listening to straight As the gate the other day and and uh if you really want to listen to a good scaling sermon that is a good sermon to listen to to maybe maybe kind of set in your mind that maybe sometimes the preachers in Church are a little bit hard but oh go back and listen to what brother random said he he was a little bit rough sometimes but he said I know you think I'm a hard guy I'm not hard I'm your brother and I love you flee the Wrath that is to come go to the cross and cry until your heart is filled with his Spirit that'll turn you back from everything of the world and walk Godly before him with your heart burning for him love not a duty Christ is not a duty to serve Christ it's a love that serves Christ it strains you constrains you till every pulsation of your life beats with him now that's that's really giving your best where you're ready to surrender everything to him ready to give up your life and you're ready to come to church ready to re receive you're you're not looking at it is just another mundane application see we we so many times we think of church as just another mundane thing just another thing we're but all we're coming to give our best to Christ if you're a priest if you're called to be a priest you're called to give sacrifices sacrifices of your time sacrifice where you you've set aside that time on Sunday where maybe the night before you hadn't stayed up all night because you've set aside knowing that you're coming to church expecting to get something so many times that they the devil will get us on a spot where I got to stay up late on Sunday night to fulfill this obligation to my family or my job or something and we just forget that the main thing the main thing is Christ we're coming here expecting remember them which have the rule over you just keep keeping in that same line of thought brother Ram said in straight is the gate he said God wake us all up this morning Shake us Lord we see the signs appearing we got our eyes open to know that we see millions millions Lord that's turn turn their back and going away I wonder what can I do what can I do oh Lord is there anything Lord if it takes more preaching more prayer more anything help me Lord that I might bring the message to the people what can I do but they continually turn it down you do your Great Signs and perform your wonders and yet the People March right on now you you think about what he's saying there that God poured out all of these signs and wonders and yet people still don't want it he does so many things right there in the midst of the church people's lives being changed people Miracles and signs and wonders doing on every hand that maybe you don't see right right out in the open but they're being done nevertheless and people don't want it and it begin to get M they well I'm just going to stay home from church on Sunday I'm this Sunday I'm uh uh uh like I was telling brother Wade I was uh at at at another church uh um there was a brother saying well you know I thought I thought since it was the last day of the of the month I'm just going to stay home from church today and so you get get you get those thoughts in your mind because it's not it's not the main thing for you that Christ is not the main thing and you come to church expecting to just well I'm just going to come to church and just got not give my all all to it I'm not going to give everything I'm not going to give all that I am to it and you begin to get expect the mundane brother random said in thot titer in church age he said it's the word that rules us not men as a man as a husband is head of the woman he rules her but the church is a woman too and her rules is the word Jesus is the word so that means that Jesus is the main thing not the man behind the pulpit not the deacons or the trustees not even my own preaching or anything like that but it's all about Jesus you know that's where the denomination World got mixed up with they thought that brother brandham should be the kind of man that would come on the scene and he'd prop up Billy Graham or he'd prop up or robbers and kind of support them but he didn't come to support no man he come to support Jesus Christ and point us toes Jesus Christ it's all about him and that's why this day of the week is set aside so we can come to church with our eyes wide open with our hearts open to receive from Christ cuz he's the main thing it's all about him I I I began to look at that message Pride that was preached up there in campbellville Kentucky this is where I go to preach when I'm going to Kentucky it's interesting that this sermon was preached there where where he talks about how that people would not give will put Jesus over in the corner and not pay him no money and he was he's setting in our mind that that's not what church is supposed to be about it's supposed to be where you you come awake and ready to receive from God and do like that little woman that that uh was ready to entertain him entertain Jesus he said the Pharisee was too busy he was meeting the doctors and the fairis celebrities he had too much to do to see Jesus come in listen I wonder if that isn't the case today if we're not too busy with our profession and other things and we fail to entertain him now that's what keeps us from doing our best I think even in my own job my my job is just just throwing this out there is a very stressful job and I go Full Tilt from about 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 and then then I just I get off the phone after being in meetings nonstop all day long and I just I just I got to take a little break but you see that's a lot of times that the devil will give you will get you in that trap where you just are going Full Tilt for your job and after after you get off work you're still working and you're working you rise up early in the morning to get a head start on the day and you work and you work and you work you know the number two reason that people on their deathbed say that the number two um uh thing thing that people wish they had done different in their life was not work so hard and that's what the devil will do is is he'll get you working so hard until you're giving your whole life to that instead of to God and you're not giving you're not giving your best to God you're giving your best to your employer I I used to work with this this guy that U that he passed away and uh probably two weeks before he passed away he sent an email around to everybody I'm trying to respond he was on his death bed I'm trying to respond to the to the project request I'm trying to do my very best to respond and I was thinking Lord if if I was ever on my deathbed don't let the last thing I do say I I I don't want people to say well he always responded to his emails I want people to respond I want people to know what I did for Christ what you do for Christ is all that matters and what you're doing right here in church this morning with your eyes wide open not willing to waste a day by falling asleep but why because you're coming with your best intention you're giving your best not expecting the day to just be some kind of a mundane thing where you just here we go to Sunday again no here we come to hear the word of God and let the word have a rule over us now brother Brown said in the message Pride he said my Lord's in town my Lord's in town won't you entertain him in your heart and that's what we failed understand that when we come to church that Christ is in the building God is in the building so when you come to church with the expectation that I'm going to get something from God whatever you have need of if you need a greater refilling then God is in the building to give it to you if you want it you can have it he said Hallelujah somebody's going to entertain him somebody is going to come to him and I want that to be said about me I want that to be said about me with my Ministry that I've given everything I can to study and lay and labor and and do and travel and whatever I can where God wants me to go and the same thing for you when the when somebody has studied and laid before the Lord and prayed and given their all to bring a message to you it's your obligation to give everything that you have to receive that word and nothing less is acceptable to God and in the message Pride he said now such a little place perhaps sitting over in the corner Pharisee was too busy he had he had to do other things the celebrity the big people of the town was there there and he had to entertain them I wonder Brethren and sisters if we haven't put so much time to entertaining celebrities and dignitaries that we forgot that Jesus sits in the midst of us two sitting over in the corner nobody noticing him sitting alone his disciples couldn't come in they wasn't even invited and I I think about that message and behold I stand at the door of the knock he said' what if the Queen of England now the Queen of England's passed on so I got a little picture of the king of england' what if the Queen of England that just recently visited the United States what if she would have come to Greenville and found the most Humble Home that there is in Greenville and knocked on the door and it would have been your home and you'd went to the door and seen that was the Queen of England it would have been an honor for you to entertain the Queen of England certainly you would have said oh Queen come into my house and if there is anything in here that you desire you can have it if You' had a little trinket that your mother gave you or some good friend gave you and you cherished it very high yet the queen was would say I would like to have that you give it to her because it would be an honor for you to give it to her because she's an important person what he saying something that your mama passed down to you that you held on to that was very cherished but if the queen asked you for it you'd give it but yeah we're so unwilling to give the things that we has hold most precious to Christ and I got this picture here of the king with a platter full of food carrying it out on a silver platter and yet this man's here laying asleep not not because he's not interested he's not interested in what the king's bringing to him oh and you think so many times we come to church and we're not willing to open up our heart and and actually just listen to the word that we'd rather lay our head up against the wall or because we have we've let our work in our life consume us we didn't get enough sleep the last night because we were up until 2:00 the last morning somewhere where we shouldn't even be as a Christian and then we come into the house of God and we won't listen to the word of God because it's not the main thing the main thing in our life is Christ and that's what it's all about Matthew 6: 21 says lay up not lay up not for yourselves Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust do corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor rust death corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also and I got a little picture here of a little family that gathered around watching the football game and they're real excited about that game and you know people that's how people do they can watch some kind of show for two or three hours but put them in church and let the devil start setting that atmosphere of unbelief and they'll go right off to sleep because why it's a spiritual thing it's not something where the preacher getting upset at you because that you don't you don't listen to him while he's up oh it's my favorite thing to preach and I want you to listen to me but it's a spiritual thing when it's not your main thing it's not your main desire it's not The Treasure of your heart and because it's not your treasure you you'd rather watch some game or some nonsense football game than than come to church and listen to the word of God being preached over the pulpit and then you'll get upset because a minister tells you the truth just like the fulfilling the scripture why will you hate me because I tell you the truth will you send me your text and tell every why why are you telling me all these things because I'm telling you the truth where is the love of God in your heart what is your main thing where is your focus in your life do you come to church because you love God or because you just you're fulfilling your obligation and you're going through the same mundane ritual week after week it's supposed to be a love affair God wants to get a hold of your heart and draw you to him he wants you to love him from your heart and not love him because somebody told you to do it that's right that's right you you think of somebody at a football game it would be an odd thing for them to tilt their head back and have their mouth a gate where a fly could go in and out of it it would be an odd thing to be for them to be tilting their head back on the on the on the chair at their football everybody around them will be they got all their all their beer and all the things that you do in a football game and they would think well this is it's an odd thing to see somebody not entering into the atmosphere and it's an odd thing for somebody in church that's not entering into the pattern of the word the rhythm of the rhythm of the speaker entering into the atmosphere of the church and and come expecting to receive and to believe something it's just as odd for somebody in church to tilt their head back and sleep that it would be for somebody at a football game to tilt their head back and just snow through the whole thing not listening and at the end of the game well who won who won oh oh don't let that be my Christian experience I want to know what's happening in church and it would be an odd thing too for you to go over to somebody's house I've had many people at my home and they come and and they sit down and we'll talk and we'll fellowship with thing Fellowship over the table and not one one time has anybody ever fell asleep in my home as we're entertaining one another over over the supper table we sit and we fellowship and we talk what a strange thing that would be if I was entertaining somebody like in this picture and their their head would begin to droop as I was maybe would you would you like some of this nice food that my wife is prepared for you you see that's what we're doing when we come to church that the word of God has been labored and prepared and studied over and it's being handed to you on a silver platter what a strange thing it would be for you to say well I'm not interested in that you see it's a heart problem when you're not interested in it it shows that there's something wrong there's something wrong if you don't understand there's something wrong if your heart's not there there's something wrong if you don't come prepared to receive the word of God give him your best in Mark 12:30 it says and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart with just part of my heart just uh Monday through Friday I'm going to give my heart to the world and my job and my boss and Sunday because I'm so tired I I've given I've already given it all I've already given it all over there the first part of the week and Sunday I I just got a little bit left so I can't give it all you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength and that trickles over Beyond even Sunday You're supposed to be you're supposed to have a steady sturdy prayer life and want to read the Bible and want to serve God with all in you and want to sit around the table with your children and teach them the word of God and give everything that you've got give your best your best is what God requires and Colossians chapter 323 to 24 it says whatever you do work at it with all your heart as working for the Lord not for human Master since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward it is the Lord Christ you are serving well if I say Amen too much that'll it might Pump Up The Minister's head I I if I if I get a church on time then they'll think I really want to be there but see it's Christ that we're serving Christ that's the reason we're here it's not to serve one another it's Christ 1 Corinthians 10:31 says so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do whatever you do do it all for the glory of the Lord I want to go full til and whatever whatever go I'm doing he's worthy of the best brother Ram said and the unwelcomed Christ what do you do for him give him the leftover oh yeah you run around all day and give him 3 minutes at night before you go to bed he deserves your best friend he deserves everything you got but what do you do about it you give him just anything he takes it he takes it anyhow he'll take it if you only wait for 5 minutes in the service he'll take it if your heart's only halfway there he'll take it but he wants your best he wants your best and I think he deserves your best he deserves your very best absolutely and I you know when darl Ward was here a while back he talked us tell us about how the University of Tennessee football team when they go through that door they put their hand up to slap it that sign that says I will give my all for Tennessee today and because of that we put that sign on the door back there above the brother Joe M printed that thing out so you can you can actually read it when you're coming in maybe you hadn't looked at it in a while but it says this day I give my best for Christ or something that that effect oh so when we pass under that wall that when they pass under that sign they're they're putting their hand up there to signify that I'm going to do my best and when we come when we pass under that door under that sign over the door oh we should we should have that same kind of reaction that I'm coming to church to give my best Christ gave his best for me these ministers are giving their best for me I'm going to give my best to them because that's what Christ deserves he deserves our best and we'll stop on that God bless you amen than you amen
