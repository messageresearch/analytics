brother canada brother joseph and his family is there with him so we're down this morning maybe that's why one side of the building is lopsided but that'll be all right anything else am i missing something richard is in the back running the thing anna's got a headache i think that's right in it didn't they say that anna had a real bad headache this morning i know brother richard's back in the place of brother joe this morning so then we're we're kind of getting everything straight all right if you like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading from hebrews 11 and we'll try to get right on into our thought and carry it on for the time you know because we're trying to speak a little bit from the book of hebrews and pray that the lord would help each one of you and bless each one father we thank you for this day and we pray that you would just guide each and every one of us in your loving understanding that father you may be the one that would have the preeminence in our hearts and our lives we know there's many sicknesses among us and you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction we know you've done this and we praise your great name and we just ask you to make it come into a manifestation into the hearts and the lives of the people because we believe you and we commit it all to you now remember those that are not here the way lord and and things we just ask you to help each and every one we love you forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in jesus christ amen hebrews 11 now we've been reading this for quite a while so everybody ought to be able to to do all right yep bible study will be coming this this coming saturday this coming saturday bible study remember that six o'clock here at the church come and be with us we've actually got over in three three months i think we've covered nine verses in the book of romans so we're doing you know we're real real good we're kind of slowing just having a good time and there are available to you that would like but you have to request it's not just something sticking up somewhere you're going to have to request from brother joe to be able to get you the copy of the bible study but we do make those also chapter 11 verse 1. now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear now here's what we'll be trying to get in today verse 4. by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice and came by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh you may be seated lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now i hope you will if you wasn't here wednesday and heard the wednesday night services i pray that you would listen to that i thought we'd done a real marvelous job speaking on abraham and his faith and how it's connected to us because that's what we're doing here in hebrews we're going to go through these warriors of faith now dropping down and as we do we're going to try to relate that to where we're at because what good is it to talk about abraham and look at him as so great and then look at ourselves as so small you know or whatever so we must see that they were only speaking of us in this day so that's our point what we're trying to do all right and we've talked about faith just as a little bit to the the visitors and the you know the others that haven't been with us you remember how we done we took the definition of the word faith and we looked it up in the bible concordance the strong's concordance you know to get the definition and uh then we looked up in webster but that definition does not give a clear understanding of what really the word faith means because when you're looking it up like that you're looking at it like well there's a baptist faith there's a methodist faith there's a presbyterian faith there's you know and really it means in those definitions it means like a doctrine or a thought or an issue or a point you know as to the word faith all right but that doesn't really clear up to me what uh we are trying to cover because we covered you remember in verse 38 of the uh uh 10th chapter is the background for going into the 11th chapter and in that you'll find that paul says now the just shall live by faith right then he drops down to the 11th chapter and tells you what faith is so here is god's definition of the word faith not man's uh concordances man's ideas man's webster uh you know we've become educated uh idiots out of doing things but thank god for them we still use them but to try to see you know the correct way of understanding so paul says see by his own revelation he said faith is the substance he doesn't make it a doctrine an idea or a concept or a belief or you know he makes it what it is faith is the substance of what anything consists of all right then we read and we covered the past few services are talking about see by or through faith verse 3 we understand the worlds were framed so that's not just a doctrine or a thought or concept because uh science can tell you how the world was framed you know but their way is that it's some kind of a big bang theory which is fine are doings but uh you know it doesn't bring a clear understanding i hope that's the point you've gained from my constantly speaking about faith is the substance and is is present tense it's not past or future it means present tense um and all right then in that we're talking about our understanding of what they're understanding right you know we're looking at our understanding from what they're understanding because see anybody's before you like the scripture says they done those things that old testament especially those things were done for our example all right see they they they spoke they done they lived they're acted out their lives as an example to you and i that we could look to that and see what's going on now all right so then we can as i said we can talk about definitions of words but the best thing is to see that faith is the substance so whatever the world consists of you know the worlds as it's called there because it's many planets many things and then you've got the worlds that are known the unknown the different ones but in doing those things we see that it had to come from somewhere all right now whatever you want to do with your doings of scientific knowledge and saying well this is this and this is that it still had to have a creator irregardless of what you come up with uh whatever how you address it uh if you want to make that us human beings on the evolution tree that we laid over on a pollywog laid over this away for a while and grown an arm and fell over another a couple of million years on the other side and growed another arm and then finally got an eyeball and finally but it still had to have a beginning where did the pollywog come from it still had to have a beginning so we go back to the word of god and see that it says the worlds were framed made you know we went back in genesis to read where it says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and there's a period it stops there that's not the first day of creation the first day of creation is verse three i think it is we went through you know because it said evening in the morning was the first day so then the world being billions of years old we have no problem with that that's a scientific fact the world being billions of years old because see in the beginning god created heaven and earth feared and just he let it lay there and let it go through different things he moved it around in space to make it to where that it would go through the ice ages and the things they can prove that happen and see that's in the bible then if we understand the bible and read it then we're we're not lost to try to destroy the or that's trying to destroy you know science or trying to make it this or that or the other we believe it but see then whatever the world consists of god had to speak it into being right i mean you would have to agree with that if you're going to believe in god and if you don't believe in god then you've got to believe you're greater than god so go ahead be an idiot you know that's the plainest language i can take and make and if we don't believe in god then we've we've got a problem we've got to believe in a creator because we are a creation and that requires a creator to come into being all right then moving along in those things we can see that what everything consists anything consists of it had to come into being all right and the worlds were framed how we just read verse 3 by the word of god all right the word of god brought into being all of the things that we see tangibles or whatever you want to make it you know it comes from the word of god so it comes from a substance greater than this substance right which is faith all right then science can go in and prove it and go on into the uh the things of of the supernatural almost to their being they're seeing and we can look at it by the word of god and see that how god done these things and in doing that then we come out to the basis of saying what faith is the substance all right we know that god is a covered last we know that god created the world all right then he started in verse three of genesis and day one he brought light into being day two he brought this day three you know finally coming up till day six and bringing man into existence and then resting on the seventh day in the garden all right so we've been through those things to talk about them and to see where it's doing but yet our mental thought is that when god created the world then he stopped creating all right he did because he's not creating more worlds but even science says of it if you want to go back and read it they say that we are a are a moving uh system of things and and that things are coming into being going on out beyond us into the to the you know almost into the eternities well you know because this clinker still may be slinging off with what we call the sun but remember we're not dumb we're not talking about the sun in the bases because there are universes of universes of universes that have their own sons and their own moons and their own stars and their own doings you know but we're sitting here where we believe that god chose to bring mankind because this is the part that he chose to do to come and bring this world into existence you know and then we don't care nothing about and forget all this about extra restaurant beings you better be worried about the beings here not something coming out of space because you find out one of these days those things coming out of space is when it comes out of here like i gave you the quote there which was amazing to me that we believe brother random was a prophet in 1955 he said russia had flying saucers well you know no problems with that you know they just take somebody and twist him up a little bit put him in a flying saucer if they shoot him down they think he's a monkey from outer space but it's funny how he speaks english that's always the point when people are contacted by these illegal aliens all right but getting to the point see because we believe this is the center of the universe i know that's the way i believe it because it's where god chose to to work from i don't care what's out there you can have your planet you can do what you want to with yours we just stay here on this and and god came down to this earth to dwell with us so this wonderful thing we have a great place to be all right then in the future home as we get on over to revelation 21 22 john sees it coming down out of heaven so then it'll be coming down to where we are all right so let's stay with us i like it here because god is with us he didn't stay somewhere else he came down to dwell with us all right then in getting that point in the thought that that we think though that well god's not creating anymore well i remember a prophet and that's what i was trying to do there wednesday or last weekend uh you remember moses he stood out there and called for flies and fleas and frogs so he must have created you know but maybe he's through creating but maybe he's not true with us you know what maybe he's and we're not going to go out and speak worlds into existence go live on them don't get in the garbage can stay where we're at whatever would be needful for the time then god can supply all right but we were trying to cover that god didn't stop creating because all at once he comes down and he creates in the wound of a virgin mary a body to come and live in so he's not through creating hebrews 10 5 he created his own body to come to live in so he's not he's not through creating all right now but in doing that too he started on the day of pentecost creating a bridegroom called the bride the church so he's not through creating we just try to limit him then we doubt him being able to speak through moses flies for these frogs etc those things not if they wasn't already there he just multiplied them through moses's mouth but yet they were a creation all right now then like the prophet of god said why would we stumble at the blood of jesus christ see if that could be done under moses and the blood of bulls and goats why would you stumble under the blood of jesus christ i believe limbs can be restored i don't think that we're going up in the rapture and i've got to have a crutch and i'm going to be missing a lag you know i don't believe that i believe we're going to have a change all right we don't believe in getting a new body because why get a new body where would you get it from jesus had nail prints in his hands why don't we want to depend upon what's real that's my whole point he had nail prints in his hands and no problem to show them after his resurrection all right but we're not going to be old dilapidated worn out men neither women we're going to be back in the prime of youth to live eternity you know in a beautiful wonderful state all right so then god's not through creating that's the point that i'm trying to get you to see he's not true creating so let's don't limit him as to our thinking you know what you can limit all you want to he's still going to do it why don't you get up in the morning and tell the sun not to rise you know but you know if god ever told you to because joshua one day told the sun to stand still and it did why can't we believe it that's in your bible why can't we believe in an eternal god who's trying his best to reveal himself to mankind and he does it through his creation and then he takes those back there in his creation that's where we're getting to today and he takes those people as i said a moment ago and he makes them an example and they're there for a reason to be an example to you and i oh if i could just be back there when moses has done this that or the other i don't want to be back there oh if i could just be back there when jesus walked on the shores of galilee i don't want to be back there i'd rather be here right in the most horrible situations of life i'd still rather be here than to be back there i kind of like our conditions and cars riding up down the road don't you i don't want to go back to mules and wagons i've spent my days in that i want to be where that god is all right and remember we'll get back to it in a little bit in the message maybe where he gets down to about verse six of hebrews and he speaks that it's impossible for us to please god unless we have this faith which is a substance you see the only way to have you remember we covered it in the sixth sense message talking about it where you have five senses to contact the earthly world which you see taste field smell in here but then you have a sixth sense which is by the baptism of the holy ghost coming and living in our hearts and by that sixth sense we can have a contact with the eternities because eternal life comes and dwells in us by the new birth all right now in doing that then we'll get to our point now we read in verse two we'll use this every service for a while like we do the other so you know verse 2 it says for by it which is talking about faith the elders obtained a good report all right so then we're going to take these down through uh abel you know enoch noah et cetera abraham and we're going to talk about them and their report that they made but remember the report that they made is the example for you and i they lived their lives out for an example for you and i all right so then that way we can look at their example and believe what god is to be here then why look back and say i wish i was back there all right which he was listening other day to the prophet he said why would we want to look back he said because he's the same yesterday today and forever but do we believe that do we believe hebrews 13 8 oh we believe john 3 16 about you get born again don't we but do we believe hebrews 13 8 that he's the same yesterday today and forever that is malachi 3 he said i'm god and i changed not all right so we don't have to worry about it all right now getting to that point then let's look at their lives but bring it up and see where we're at because faith is a substance all right see if you're prayed for and god heals you it took a creative act of god right you break an arm what do you do doctor puts it back together he can't heal it there is no such thing in medical science of creating life they do the closest they can to it on a lot of things but they cannot create life but they can put together put it out show it up cut it out do whatever but it takes god to create those sales to bring all of that back together you understand me all right so god is not through creating come on break it down to where we're at where we're living see we're we've got our mind the way out under or way back there instead of looking at the realities of what life is now you realize what i was just saying that a bone could be broken you pull it out put it back together wonderful put splints on it do everything we can but you can't heal that it takes a creation of life to heal that back together all right then is there any different for god to where he heals a bone and it comes together or the thing is thought off and god wants to put it back oh we don't go that far right why not are you going to limit god you are you're limiting him to the basis that he can't do it because of your unbelief remember that's the only thing god can't get over is our unbelief but don't worry about it he'll just move around you somebody else as i said go out there and tell her son not to come up in the morning at least come right on up he just bypasses go right on but you see the prophet said there'll come a time when limbs will be restored where's that coming from a creation i look at a baby i see a little baby come into the world and i thank god you're not true creating because that starts from a little bitty thing that cannot be seen right you know with a natural eye and develops into a human being living below our privilege is what i'm trying to get you to see but why can't we just believe it and god moving among us as he had we were talking about this the other day brother gary now that there's a lot of things god has been doing among us but we don't listen to it and look at it but i'm not going to stop i want to stop when we leave this earth in a change of these bodies that'll be the ultimate of healing is when these bodies are totally finished all right but you say well brother dale i'm just you just don't understand my problem no i don't understand your doubting is that strong enough i don't understand you're doubting why are you doubting you know what the prophet said called sister uh frida called me the other night and said she was dying with a headache or something shoulder aching she was hearing the church and the things just went away all right but a few days later it came back she called and we said a simple prayer lord go back and do what you've done the other night in the church that was way afraid and just bring back that healing to her we hung up the phone she walked in today said the minute we hung up the phone that hurt and stopped well you know what that should do that should show up throw everybody in the church into desperation to believe god come on you say well that just went away why don't you take it away i mean if it just went away you ought to know how to take it away yeah go down you can make a lot of money right put it on the internet you can take away headaches go ahead you get multiple rich you know yeah i'm not trying to make it silly i'm trying to make it straight see we want to prop up things and and do things that were you know of doings but now let's get into the thought today that we read it says by faith by revelation is that what abel had it was revealed to abel what happened in the garden all right now and as it was revealed to him he offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh a lot to cover there by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice now first i want to get this out of the way there is a lot of arguments and a lot of contradictory points of saying that it was more excellent than cain so cain offered an excellent one and abel offered a more excellent one you've heard that preached that's all right that's your business but what i want you to think about abel by faith offered a sacrifice the blood of an animal because he knew why they were in the problem they were in right but why did cain offer flowers fruit etc i hope you can see this point abram offered a sacrifice cain was trying to appease a lot of difference in trying to appease god and a sacrifice to take care of it see people today they build beautiful churches and have wonderful offerings they have great things they're doing a lot of work around the world and they're they're sending billions of dollars around the world thank god for all of it you know and and helping the sick and the people and all of the things wonderful but where's their sacrifice that's no more than appeasement see cain was not trying to offer an offering a sacrifice he was trying to appease god because he didn't believe what abel said is that what it says in genesis is it right that during genesis you had cain and abel the first two boys and they come up to a time which meant they were up in their at least maybe 20 years of age or something they had been there quite a while in the garden that's my point and as it did they came to a time that they offered sacrifices all right well abel he offered the blood of a lamb right a lazy shitless come on he surely had a revelation of what's going on or if not he was laying back in the woods somewhere waiting on the lamb to get old enough to go out and kill it whereas abel were i mean a cane he was up working like crazy because he called him a tiller of the soil right abel was a keeper of sheep so look like cain's offering should have been accepted right he worked himself to death to do or either went out and at least gathered enable all he's doing and just wait until the lamb gets right goes out picks one out of the crowd takes it up cuts his throat burns it as an offering as he does cain he gets all upset because god you remember in genesis do we need to read it that god come to cain and said cain why are you upset you know why are you upset about me accepting abel's sacrifice he said now you go do just paraphrasing it but read your scripture it tells it you go do as your brother done and i'll accept you so what it came to he said look i've worked i've worked abel is a lazy bum laid over there on the side and never done a bit of work to get nothing what he's doing lord i've at least worked myself to death for you right come on he said that's not written in the bible but we ought to be able to talk a little bit about playing common sense there was a conversation between god and cain right not no two words written down it was a conversation and god said look cain as your brother done and then your flowers will turn from an appeasement to a wonderful offering sure we know what cain's all spoke of he worked himself to death he was a good worker it was his good works but good works does not appease an angry god right when god says give a lamb you give a lamb what if moses would have come up and told levi levi i want you to get your beautiful we got all this ready we got everything made here in the temple we got everything we got all the rooms we got everything you go out and pull you some flowers and cure them in there i i don't think i don't think that's what moses told levi to you i don't think levi would went i wouldn't because i know that those things we're only trying to appease and you've got to have a sacrifice first all right that's why it says it cain you know they're able to offer them more excellent sure it was a sacrifice to cain to what he was doing but yet he was only trying to appease because he never followed god's plan god's plan was blood right now why couldn't cain remember that's my point you know cain was there around just as well as april was there right i mean like i say that maybe it was 20 years of age but it's given a number might have been 40 50. you know back in the old testament there was a lot of age before even had kids got to say some of them was 150 years old before they had any kids well i don't think it works today you know even test you problems with that but my point he was there with him right and he could look around and he could see that they were wearing clothes made from skins they didn't have walmart okay they didn't have walmart back there so they had to make their clothes and it made them out of the skins of the animals right you remember eve thought it worked with fig leaves she kind of made her a dress didn't she had a thick leaves that didn't work don't you think my point is don't you think that cain knew the story let's don't be blind let's don't be something that which you know cain was i just as well as abel maybe maybe adam and eve didn't explain to him but i think i'd be a bad mom and daddy you can think what you want to if adam was the son of god even a fallen estate i think he still was holding on along to worship and believing god don't you but what happens cain gets his own idea come on in brothers sister welcome so abel he's not in a position to uh have a seniority he was really the younger supposed to be cain was supposed to be first all right you understand my point cain and abel both in the garden both living at the edge of the garden both living there both looking at all of the things both knowing that they could not proceed beyond one point because they were flaming swords whether they were visible or invisible they still didn't walk back in the garden right abel never walked back in the garden it wasn't able walked in and hey look i mean no no no no neither one of them could go back in they knew it was death to pass that one place all right if he explained death to pass that place don't you think that at least adam and eve talked a little bit over a 20-year period for the boys to get old enough to at least offer a sacrifice i just made it 20 years as a point of interest because it did come up that they were to make their own sacrifices so they must have had a little time all right but here comes abel and i said well ago lazy bum lays out there and lets him sheep eat all he wants to because there wasn't a whole lot to bother him back then probably wasn't too many wolves around because you remember it right after the fall there you know and you're able i mean here's cain he just worked himself to death so we come up to time to make an offering and abel says all right i'm gonna offer they're sitting down talking you know make a story out of it they're sitting down talking and cain and abel's talking it over and there with no five minute conversation remember they had years to do it and they were talking about what to do and they came up with a way you know saying well we need to make an offering a sacrifice all right true and as their discussion goes on abel says to king say cain what are you going to do he said i'm going to gather the prettiest roses i'm going to get the prettiest pomegranates and all of these beautiful fruits and things and i'm going to lay them before that gate were the flaming swords at to try to appease an angry god because they knew they were in a state of god being angry at them right what's the purpose of making a sacrifice he says well abel what are you going to do he says i'm going to take one of these lambs i won't figure out the best one that don't have no marks or not no and i'm going to take him up here i'm going to kill him i'm going to burn him right there in front of place come on if we didn't know the story and you'd listening to me tell the story then we would be on cain's side right because of his works and his doings and that's what he symbolically was speaking of and works is wonderful after you're born again they are expected after you're born again but works before you're born again won't bring you nothing come on remember jesus was the one that said it one day he said there's nothing good no not one where was the immortal being that would have an opportunity to go back in the garden right there was no way to get back in there but there come a time that they realize they must make an offering to god so abel takes a lamb and he kills it maybe a few years they had sat down and discussed this situation of what they were going to do don't look at cain as a uh hateful arrogant uh unbeliever uh someone who does not believe in god he was trying to make an offering to appease his god because he realized the angry skies the things that were you know taking place the animals eating each other and then wind up eating the animals by this time you know and abel he says cain but can't you see that we got to offer blood said because we were born in our mother from our mother and blood comes forth and said we were born in her blood from daddy's blood it was revealed to abel right but how much does it take beating you on the head to find out if revelations right right i mean somebody lays out the story to you that what happened in the garden had to be blood don't you think abel could remember to say cain don't you remember the stories daddy told us of how that once him and mama done wrong said god killed those animals and took the skins off of them so you don't want to believe that i sit and look at you when i talk like that but you don't want to believe that god took the skins off those animals because you don't think he was strong enough to do it you don't think he was real enough to do it you don't think that he was you think he was a spirit you want to stay with the old baptist god is a spirit amen that's right but he stripped him animal skins off and give them to adam and eve to put on and he didn't drive and tanned them you've heard your prophet talk about when they were walking out of the garden that those bloody skins flopping on their legs but he said god was satisfied right god was the first one to offer an animal but you don't think god's that real you think he's some spirit or some spook or something remember the point of what i've been at for the longest faith is the substance so then god has to be greater than any substance there is because he created the substance if there's a creation there's got to be a creator the creator is greater than the creation don't make us greater than him don't make us to be something that he's a peanut something that we control him you remember me telling you about that man said he wouldn't he wasn't working on commanding the lord anymore said he's working on commanding the devil i mean excuse me he wasn't working on commander the devil to work on commanding the lord because the bible said command you me i said man you sure are messed up you mean you're going to command god that's what the bible says i'm going to command god i said it doesn't mean that way it means to take him at his word and he'll do what he said not to command him that he's got to go do it don't pray a prayer that god you've got to do this you've got to do that but you see abel i'd like to make it so strong until i wish i could but was able a different type of a person or different something or were they just two boys two men you know i mean cain what no mean arrogant guy he became that because that god turned down his flowery beautiful offering but remember like i said abel had a revelation it was blood was born in mama's blood from daddy's blood and blood was what the animals was offered when they come out of the garden god offered them animal skins and scepted the blood in the place of mankind and didn't destroy adam and eve right you see we could spend a lot of time talking about how bad kane was and what will energy come from but what good is to talk about that talk about the reality of what it is then you look around the world today and you see the religious system as i was talking about a while ago beautiful church his wonderful offering sending money everywhere sending people sending out doctors sending out all things to help people right that's wonderful but where's their offering before god well now lord we're doing this you ain't never heard anybody say because there was one man one time laid out in the field and said god way back under hundreds of years ago and said god if you don't give me the holy ghost you'll find a pile of bones right here in this field you ain't never heard that used god knows i want the holy ghost and if he don't give it to me it's his fault because i want it see we're still in that religious society because that's what that was back there a religious society on both sides kang wasn't a horrible dirty he was trying to get on the good side with his god right but as i said well ago what'd he do he offered the fruits of the land that he worked for he was trying to appease god he should have listened to abel because abel was one with the common sense cain couldn't take what he saw because you know what cain would have been saying come on you don't ever think we can follow abel coming down and still able to realize that mama and daddy blood caused the problem the animals had to be killed it come on down and then he could see it's not written about all the children in the bible i'll just leave that for you to think but listen you can follow that all the way back but follow the fruit back whatever you want to make it apples orange pomegranates peaches or whatever that you say eve eat an apple come on we don't believe that no apples give you the belly ache they don't mor they don't demoralize you and eve said the beast said subdued me beguiled me defiled me but i'm not even trying to go back that far because there's no no need of it now if people don't understand it or sitting here especially then you're in bad shape and anybody that don't understand this height for their services you come into office we'd be glad to talk about what happened in the garden some of you shaking your head so you evidently know what it is you probably heard it it wouldn't know apple and orange that brought them out of the garden all right but see what about it follow you take your fruit come on take your good works i've explained the best i can he said he offered a more excellent sacrifice meaning that cain's offering would have been fine if he had offered the blood first then he would have been putting his life works behind his sacrifice but he had no sacrifice he had an offering you understand it he had an offering he didn't have a sacrifice abel had to sacrifice and they're able was trying to explain it to his brother and you know that god even comes down after that he you know we don't want to think about god talking to dirty people right we don't want to think of a god that comes down and talks to people that are in sin well let me solve that problem in a hurry where did you come from did you get it you garbage can because that's what we all were god come to you didn't he was your sweet loving thy sweet little person you were just through you were so so good that god saved you because he was good good for nothing good for nothing is the best way to put it but you see take your flowers have you ever thought of it that way take your flowers take your fruits and go back to where the start in the fall was you know what you'd have you'll have adam and eve doing wrong and you had the god coming down and pulled a bunch of bouquets flowers right he would have laid up some oranges and some apples and something and he said okay y'all go ahead everything's all right because i'm accepting your sacrifice and with no sacrifice sacrifice deals with life you don't deal with your works works is supposed to be an outward manifestation of an inward work that has taken place in our hearts by the new birth right what does the bible say about our goodness our righteousness it says it's filthy rags in the sight of god that's what your bible says you don't believe in being good brother dale no i don't believe in being good i believe in being born again right oh yeah you take what i just say it now i believe in being born again and you start with a sacrifice then your works follows it and god comes down with a bouquet of roses because your life is a bouquet of roses before him and he comes down with a bouquet of roses to you because you've made the right atonement to start with and abel and cain listen to abel and even god read your bible if you'll do as your brother done you'll be accepted he had an opportunity oh we're so much serpent seed message people until you preach that cain didn't have no opportunity you go with your bible i got the quotes where the prophet said that he offered salvation to cain so you're going to deny brother brown's message and you're going to deny the bible go ahead and do what you want to i'm just trying to make the point clear to you because i can take what i stand here now and believe in the blood of jesus christ and follow it back through every one of these warriors of faith and go right back to the garden but you take your good works and father i want you to show me one in the bible that had any good works we will go to the story of the two in the prayer place right where one of them is standing there and he's saying lord look what i've done i've paid my tithe i've sacrificed i prayed every day i've done all of my doings and i ain't like him over there you remember that well you know he was right come on he was talking to god he was right but here's a man on the other side he said lord i ain't got nothing to offer you ain't never been nothing but a garbage can all week long but just forgive me forgive me lord who at home justified well because this man over here they said repentance he had an offering to go by i'm going to sacrifice this man over here had just an offering of his life and paul says that won't work before god you don't believe in being good no sir i believe in being born again and let god live in you and that's what paul said to life that i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god a mass murderer right was that who paul was serial killer right killing christians causing them to blaspheme show me his good life it brought god on the scene the only thing paul had was one thing in his heart he had a desire in his heart to find that jehovah god that he searched for all the days of his life right because he was a good person in in the points of of being according to the law but are you following me because my point is abel faith revelation brought a lamb into existence for him will yours bring in an existence for you or you only want to make it works there is a message a tape that i wish you would listen to and if i get the title wrong i'll get it back well amen it is a private interview 1964 705 1964 705 it's got an x on the end it's called private interview which is an interview he's bringing it up where you can read it off of that which was an interview view with a sister named bruce you know she talks about how everything is and brother branham reading i want you to listen to it brother branham is constantly trying to tell her lady you need to believe you need to believe you need to accept but you know what she's doing just like we do yeah but lord brother branham you don't understand i've done so much wrong he said but he's looking through the blood he don't see you yeah but i don't see you get the message and listen to it it's a very short one if not run it on your computer it'll run up right there she was doing everything in the world and you know what when the testimony ends it still doesn't say she accepted my point is what are we in a religious society that's trying to appease an angry god are we born again christians who believe in the sacrifice that was made for us that we can go back with what we believe all the way to the garden and come out of there with the same blood atonement and be like abel that by faith you know what happened in the garden right god comes down as i said a moment ago he's talking to cain he said kane go back and do what your brother done and you'll be all right cain actually said i've done all i can do you want to quote from the prophet he said i've done all i can do take it or leave it he said that's what the religious society is saying today lord i've worked myself to death i've done all of these things and you've got to agree they're right he said now you take it or leave it see there's no blood because why not even now what is it they want the blood out of the songbook right oh don't talk about blood you're scared of people scare what talking about blood come on abel knew he was born in his mama's blood from his daddy's blood because he knew by then he was old enough to understand what took place in the garden came was blinded in his own doings right what else are you going to say was cain some kind of a different kind of a something an inhuman and human because his daddy was the beast no he was still offering sacrifices you know over there in israel right today on one side is the ones coming from ishmael and they're talking about one true and living god go over on the other side which is coming from ishmael or one of them's from isaac the other nice boy you know two different boys two different groups of nations both of them serving god if you can't see it folks you're blind as a bat come on i don't preach about governmental things and you know better than that because i generally stay away from it ain't none of my business but there are the israelites on one side oh yeah they're fighting for their country sure are but there's a group from kane coming down the moabites all of those over there coming from ishmael wow man they give them in 67 they give them the temple back they were a wiped out defeated people and israel to be nice gave them the temple back they run in the temple and said we defeated y'all we made y'all back off come on israel today i'm not against nations or for our nations them israelites are a arrogant bunch of little people but they're mean and hateful and they're fighting for their god-given right but you know what the ishmaelites are fighting for their god-given right read your bible like why we're talking about wednesday we want to throw out this like that through hagar came a promise that the ishmaelites would be rule the biggest portion of the world and they do but you can't appease them right they've done lost seven or 800 people right and israel's lost about 30. it's like i saw a guy on a movie said he's talking about the alamo and he was a hispanic mexican whatever the word y'all want to use i don't i don't play but you know what he said he said we defeated you at the alamo and they did right the hispanics the spanish or whatever the words are you they defeated the people at the alamo the guy said yeah he was 501. no wonder i said we defeated you in the next one and that ended it too right but you see you can't appease them canaanites you can give they could give them all of israel and they wouldn't stop you can't stop them people give them everything that they want and they're only going to take more because they're trying to make some form and then they say if you get killed in a war you get to go to heaven where you got 70 virgins right and now the women are dying but they don't say what the women's going to get right you can't see the canaanites and from abel and cain today out in the world what's wrong with your blinded mind but you see i'm not trying to preach it that way i'm trying to appreciate it and what what does it mean to you and i there was a day that you and i was just as much a cane as anybody could be because that's the whole human race of mankind lost born in sin shaping the neck we've gone into the world speaking lies lost we didn't need a bunch of flowers to get us back we needed a lamb abel's revelation was it was blood so he offered blood that only spoke of the blood of jesus christ they didn't speak of flowers and they spoke of blood the god himself was gonna have to come down and die pay the price all i'm asking is one simple question we'll quit in a second what about your revelation will it bring a lamb we'll get to it this evening will your revelation bring a lamb for you well i've done got the lamb he died to that every denomination there is say the same thing that 2 000 years ago a lamb died what good is that if it's not a personal experience remember the whole point of what i'm talking about is what a positive attitude everybody in the bible that ever was in the bible meant any mounting to anything had a positive attitude well i'm going to church today i hate it i know what they're going to do they're going to do what does your prophet say he said you can't wait till the doors open but you don't understand my case why don't you bring some flowers and try to appease me with it maybe i'd understand your case dirty i agree with you but did he get the point across see we're standing right before the garden of eden and the sword is turned everyway but you know what i like the way the prophet explained it he said that sword was turning the way to keep them from the tree of life he said but that sword one day anchored into a man's side that was hanging on a tree and said now those same angels that was trying to drive us out of the garden to keep away to it he said they're trying to drive us back to it same angels that was trying to keep us away is now trying to drive us to the trevor because who is the tree of life jesus christ and who is he he's the word that true abel spoke of a coming messiah cain spoke of a religious society that would make everything so beautiful but even take the blood out of the songbooks you know what i'm talking about is true i love to talk to people that are 20 years old and up because they got a little sense abel's offering was what god required you know what in abel in all of his doings and loving god and doing you know what abel could have done the next day and god would have been happy he could have went out and he said cain can i borrow some of your fruit i'm going down today not to try to appease him because he's already appeased but i'll take some of your works and i'll lay it down before the gate god loves for us to walk right and do right but to do it from an inward work of christ not because of a book of rules that we got to do to be saved book of rules don't save nobody it takes a born-again experience then what you're talking about would be fine but just remember the point i made cain tried to appease abel knew what happened because he knew god took the skins off of them animals in the original and he says god i'm giving back to you what you've done where does cain fit come on you ought to be listening a little bit where does cain's revelation fit nowhere in the bible does it fit come on brothers will you lamb will your revelation bring a lamb or will it bring fruit what do you mean brother dale i go to church i do that's wonderful as long as it's coming from a heart of a born-again christian that's why david will get to it eventually one of these days you know david being a murderer being a whoremonger being everything in the world you could make him right but yet the bible said he was a man after god's own heart god said one day like this he said your sacrifice is your offerings come on am i quoting scripture has become a stink in my nostrils the thing he ordained for them to do had become a stink in his nostrils he said but he said a man with an honest and a contrite heart is the one i look to what about it have you got a lamb or is it a bunch of flowers you're trying to make it beautiful instead of just being yourself and just letting god live there's no need of trying to appease god you know what i differed with a brother years ago you know what he found out that he was wrong at least he said he was yeah that's all right cody later he said he wouldn't so that's up to him but anyhow he bought me boots he bought me shirts and this man didn't spend ten dollars on a shirt this is 30 years ago did he spent 50 on a shirt because he wanted to be back on the good side with me well you know what he's not to give me a dime to be on any side because when he said brother forgive me i said you're forgiven for you ever done it brother if that ain't able in the garden i'd like to find out what it's supposed to be and see i'm the kind of person and you know it if you do me wrong and you ask me to forgive you that will never be mentioned again in my life i don't care if you do it same thing again that won't be mentioned why because i said i forgive you when are we going to get that away well i just can't do it brother dad well you need to pray that's some pain thing let's stand what do we got brother three twenty three three three twenty four same of course three twenty three upon that old tree by his strides we are healed and by his blood we are sealed hallelujah to in the name of jesus christ we send this person and the rape what and you're right again in appreciation to the lamb i don't preach to try to be saved that was probably a long time ago i tried to preach to tell you about the god sounds i want to be an example hallelujah don't want to go up hallelujah to the lamb of god well it was in the name of jesus christ our brother he would come that he needs patience take that patience because that's the only patience but when they laid him in the tomb the power of the lord came in it up to him as you leave and think about him you're dismembered by
