pour out your power and love holy holy wor [Music] shining in the light of your GL pour out your power in love holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want see amen amen and we see him through the word right hallelujah amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turn to Hebrews 6 and we've been on Hebrews 8 for quite a while so let's drop back to Hebrews 6 and we'll be changing the title of the services for a little while you know trying to get into something to move on with the Lord but just remember now the Lord willing we will be having a brother Royals Serano will be preaching for us this coming Wednesday and just keep him in your prayers that the Lord would bless us because we want him to bless him to be able to get here but uh I've always been kind of selfish on the other end I like to hear cuz I believe faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word amen so just remember that now also I wrote myself a note I noticed what I had done at the end of the service but somebody here in the morning service please if you're hearing this when go back to the morning service I I crossed up Gideon and had him bringing uh needing a banner when he should have been having peace okay so that's why I said y'all get it right I just I'm just trying to preach but I noticed that and I picked it up and and everything and I said well the best thing to do is just uh you know straighted up this evening so I believe Gideon probably needed he brought a banner but he needed peace but uh you know just you keep it right so I always say you put it together I just try my best to preach and and you get your mind running out and going out and you know and it's not worth two cents anyway so you know so just uh just remember that Hebrews 6 we're going to be picking up a a little talk and going on now with what we're talking about now this will be a continuation it won't be a uh U you know starting something new it'll be a continuation of climbing up all right now remember way to be traveling back today and remember Brother Dean down speaking for his brother okay father we thank you we love you we know for assurity that thou are God and you change not Lord what we need is we need a change we need a change to understand and walk in where you want us to walk and Lord forgive our sins cuz we know that we're human Mortals and we know we make mistakes we're human we do things that are not right not in the the world of sin or something but maybe into just their own selves and their own attitudes and ways but we pray that you would just help us and lead us in understanding and just let your light come and dwell with each and every one of us bless those that are not here just give understanding to each one and you said in your word that you would send your word and heal us so we believe you and we take your word for it and we just commit it to you now have your way as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen now we're going to verse chapter 6 verse 1 we'll just read three verses because we'll try to hold it to a point and then we'll continue on down a little bit maybe in another message therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrines of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment now watch and this will we do if God permit right you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing I believe God has permitted Us in this last days to be able to uh you know move on into the Realms that maybe our our brothers and sisters down through time we're not capable capable of reaching because of the uh word that was revealed in their day and time amen let me check the Heat and and a because W's not here to to do his doings and I see some Fanning and some reaching for quilts so you know we'll get a happy medium okay it'll help everybody to get a happy medium okay all right now as I said it now we're not leaving what I've been on you'll see in a minute we'll pick it up bring it up into the New Testament all right and uh speaking of the things because all that we've used on the uh seven compound names of Jehovah has been related to Old Testament people and experiences all right now I believe that we need to bring that up into a new testament situation our understanding and uh you know and doing that then you'll see that we're not leaving that but we're trying to to move on in the doings now Paul as we've said for quite a while he he was talking and he said now I I want to sum this up that we have such a greater high priest all right it's wonderful because we put all of the honor and Glory upon the Lord Jesus Christ Ecclesiastes he says now we'll hear the conclusion of the matter bringing it down down to a a situation of understanding and seeing where we're at all right now what we want to do today and I'm telling you this ahead to where that when we we'll drop back and pick up and drop back I believe that in the end time that there is to be a message brought I believe it was brought by the prophet I believe it was to fulfill Zachariah that The Headstone would come crying Grace Grace unto it and I believe that that could never been understood until this day we had a head cu the church on the day of Pentecost started off with a head there was a head there but it was not the headstone and see then there's something to happen in the end time in the finishing up and I'm trying to just lay that down for you to look at it and see I believe that the like the prophet said the head and body would unite in the last days to bring the message amen all right now brother bradam had to bring it right you see now the body see has got to say the same thing as the message of the Prophet that's why I've tried to preach to you so much about you know that uh Joshua and the walls of Jericho that it was not the words of Joshua that brought down the walls of Jericho it was the word of the people it was the shout in the people amen all right see then that's what we must have is the message of the hour revealed to you and I right Amen in the part that we have need of to individuals what I mean part because it'll be fullness but around the world I believe this message around the world is being revealed I don't believe it's just Lula I never said that I've never taught it like that because it it would be incorrect see you know I I don't believe that everybody's gathered in Lula and this all is going I've never said that see I believe around the world that there is a five-fold Ministry bringing the message as is needed you know and putting it together then we we come out to the to to the point but I believe that there's a message will happen with the when The Headstone comes and unites with the body amen I said when it unites with the body I believe it'll be a messag amen all right and that message will be the final message to be brought now how long it would take to preach it there no problem to me because it took 2,000 years for us to preach that he has risen right I mean what are you worried about how long it's going to be Brother D you think it'll be very short well uh you know very soon well I'm hopeing right but uh you know that's because of the age limit we all getting on you know right I was kind of grinning there a while ago not at you and I but thinking about all of us here you know kind of we're getting kind of old and brother Ray he can stumble a little bit and brother dick he falls around and you know things just happens to us that brother Thomas back there you know he steps off of a ladder and all of them were small things like 4T right wasn't somebody falling off of a 40 story building right I think each one of them was about 4T that they stepped or would only up that much but see we're all getting old well I think it's time that we get into the message to be able to conquer this old age and that's what I'm hoping you say well what are you trying to do take one step at the time that's right now I've never believed like brother Mo said you look at a ladder and you back up you know you you run and you jump about three rungs and you going to fall and get hurt brother how because he done what we've all done when you get down to the L 4 foot on the ladder you you don't even think about it you just step off and he had done that probably thousands of times but there was a piper something laying there and it just rolled him see but we don't need to do that we need to take one step at a time well brother they aren't you nervous and believe we're going to miss it no that's what makes us is going to make us miss it is when we we get nervous you know and and and see we'll start trying to figure it out and that to me is what's happened to the basics of the messy people they trying to figure out what it's going to be instead of just taking one more step did the day of Pentecost come because of something that was planned out or was it because of God's promise God's promise all right the rest is going to be in the end time see all right I believe now this is I'm just telling you what I believe I believe that we're at least in the beginning stage of The Headstone message amen and I use that with as much honor and respect as I can to and the reason I use it like that then that way it doesn't leave anybody out everybody else wants to leave everybody out to try to claim something for their own self right no maybe other people are on up up the stature of a perfect man there's people all up through this pyramid right you know well I believe when The Headstone comes it'll be it'll come and be so uh simple until people won't realize what's going on right and I've believ for quite a while and been preaching for quite a while that I believe the headstone is here and that The Headstone will bring its own message in the end time right I just believe that and that's what I'm putting my confidence in as to seeing that and then we'll try to preach it all right now I didn't bring the this this in this morning I mentioned it but U let me try to explain something just a minute and you'll understand each one of those people back there in the Old Testament Abraham Moses whatever they were not born again believers they did not have the new birth cuz it hadn't come yet all right you say well brother Dale you know why we need to understand that because you're finding out now that a lot of people of the message don't believe it that way you the message people right don't believe it that way and I believe that whenever heard of this message right I believe when I was in the Baptist I could read the Holy Ghost had not been given right you know see so it couldn't be a new birth until the death of the testator right that you know that's never been a problem well you just badst well that's all right whatever it is I believe it and it'll fit the word amen see then that way I'm not looking and see the people say well you're you're downgrading Those Old Testament son no I'm not that's right now bud you better believe one thing for certain you're looking at a man that realizes Abraham was a man right I've tried to preach that to you he was not a born again believer he was a man but when God spoke to that man Abraham believed that God right and he stayed with it no matter what anybody else said his wife or whoever he stayed with what it was cuz he believed it Moses believed God at the burning bush well have Moses that just something happened you know no no he believed it and you know what he believe it SM he took over Egypt that's right well ain't too many other people that believe false things that take over their whole nation and destroy it but see they had Faith then for the time that they were needful as I was trying to say then Abraham didn't need a Healer he needed a sacrifice to take Isaac's place that was what he had need of and that's what God supplied right you see I believe that God is going going to supply what we need at Lula now have you followed me what we need at Lula we're not we're not trying to Pastor the whole world but I'm constantly looking and listening to try to find others that are preaching what if you want to be dis plained straight honest about it pleas it like I believe it bless well who are you I'm me who are you that's all that that problem I mean what I see and what I believe that's right that's what I stand on that's right until I'm changed and you show me where I'm wrong then I'll change to what you believe right right but you know just that point you see but each one of those people back there then what did they have brother Dale if they didn't have the new birth cuz they had Faith to move mountains they had Faith to win battles they had Faith to cross a ocean and you know dry ground great things they had faith for the time that they needed it it was not a new birth Born Again experience that brought that into reality right why can't we just simply believe God right yeah but he ain't never spoke to me there's the Bible right right here's the prophet's message right what are you looking for come on a glob something to come out of the sky bunp you over the head what are you looking for it's simply believe in God you know that Adam he just believe God you know what Moses he just believe God well if I could be like Abraham I know what you're saying I understand but remember you're talking about a man that wouldn't born again and you say you're born again but see a lot of times maybe we're not believing like those Believers back there believed I say we me okay even with the new birth brother Dale even with the new birth right because we've got a lot of problems Brother G I'm talking about a while ago we got a lot of problems being able to get two things together and the two things together is like I explained it to him this is what I believe I believe by the new birth and I'm illustrating with a circle of my hand there's the birth in the soul but there's a body and a spirit out here that has to get connected some way to that right I didn't play around with what I say in this morning I meant it your new birth is in you right right your healer is in you right your peace is in you your your righteousness is in you and the Rapture is in you right right and it started on the day of Pentecost because those Believers were Resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in the soul but they all died so what but somebody's not going to that's right when we get this person lined up that to me is what the stature of perfect man is okay Jo not a lineup person but let's go on now see then what I'm trying to get you to see is let's call what they had I tried to preach this one time before let's call call it faith for the time let's just take a little series on this and just talk about it of faith for the time now listen I try to explain something to where it will help the human mind cuz I realize that I'm dealing with human Minds okay you know what if you was up here preaching you'd be dealing with human Minds right now what if you come up to what if you took Abraham we talk about him and I'm not degrading because you know that's what you think I'm sorry I'm sorry you'd believe it but what if you took Abraham and sit him down in the upper room and the Holy Ghost is about ready to fall and the father of Faith as we call him and that's what he is do you know that the Holy Ghost couldn't fall until Abraham got up and walked out of the room he said brother Dale you sure think funny I agree with you but you tell me how it could cuz he wouldn't had anything for it to fell on there was only 120 in the upper room right and those were the one that had walked with him for three and a half years it took that long to be able to get a foundation laid in the heart of man that the day of Pentecost could come now you understand that's why I try to just be sensible I try to look at things just straight and blunt just and Abraham wouldn't had that cuz he wouldn't have had the three and 1/2 years of the ministry of Jesus Christ sown down in his heart I probably get repercussions off the internet on that statement but I still believe it you put David up there that problem Solomon Moses why because they would have not have been able to have faith for the time cuz their faith for the time was back over there that's right and you know what that faith for the time done for them sealed them in to when Christ came they could be part of it amen now that's how I believe it you express it to me some way but but you look like it degrading what I believe it'd be Hing am in right but you see once that happened in the upper room then you're getting to a place you you've got faith in your heart and Mankind until the new birth came it could only have faith for the time right that's what brother Rand said about it on he didn't say for everybody we talking about the little woman that touched the H of His Garment and he said she's made whole he said that woman came with a perfect faith for that time there's the title we'll be using for that time perfect faith for that time he goes on in the same paragraph and says the disciples did not have perfect Faith he said because the epileptic Child Jesus had give them the ministry right right to heal the sick cast out Devils raise the dead heal it all of it but when they came up against that epileptic child they couldn't cast it out he said because they didn't have perfect faith now he goes on to say it this way I got to let on the Des if you want he said because it's hard to have perfect faith without the Holy Ghost right he said because the Holy Ghost has to bring it amen so they didn't have perfect Faith right that faith that dwelt for the [Music] time that would hold them for whatever they had need of and it was the greatest thing that God could reveal in that day you see what my point the greatest thing could have ever happened with Abraham a man that could believe God David a man that would be in adultery be in all kind of forms of humanity but yet he loved God he said Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee on the way going to home from the bed of basba he said restore unto me the joy of thy salvation but he believe God he that was what brought God to the man that's right then he found a man that was capable like I've always said how many people do you think maybe God dealt with in the days of Abraham well they want to dealt with Abraham because he's dece his see you're just running it off you're not impressing me at all but Abraham was the only man that would listen to God when are we going to get into that place we talk about the new birth to put the believer inside of us and then we can't believe God here's a man that believed god without the new birth right those Old Testament Saints had Faith then for the time that little woman she had faith for the time those it was healed in the time of Jesus faith for the time but there was a time came when a group of people didn't have just say faith for the time now you going to think I cross myself in a minute because I'm coming right back there but they had God's faith right God's faith the new birth amen but then so much had got polluted down through the church ages until you look at Martin Luther and them and you wonder what did they have well in comparison to the book of Acts Martin Luther had the new birth amen don't mess me up right there now and think I'm saying something wrong he had a new birth but compare that with the day of Pentecost he was holding on to faith for the time right cuz that was all God could reveal to him right as all he could reveal was the just you live by faith see we have faith for the time we have the new birth their faith for the time didn't give them the new birth but our faith for the time gives us a new birth and puts us to a place to believe God God and why we can't we believe it you mean they could take you now and deprogram you send you to some kind of a school and deprogram you and take you back to a trinity don't believe so you know but you know they can if you don't have a new birth right they can do it if you don't have the new birth they can't deprogram the you birth right no you want de programs in New Birth so you say well brother Dale you saying all those people are lost at this that no sir no sir that's between them and God right I'm just trying to preach truth right see Fai for the time now I'm saying this and then I'll get off this page right so then when you're born again and there is more advancement to come and you're standing with faith for the time but when you receive the faith of the fathers and there's more to come that becomes faith for the time because it's what's to hold you at that place but see Jesus wasn't faith for the time he was the faith right but you know what it took all of their faith for the time to produce him he could have not walked out of there had it not been all of those Believers with faith for the time neither can the end time come unless the bride of Christ is able to stand upon all of the things that has been brought unto us and maybe even look at it that maybe this is Faith for the time because there's more to come that's why I never make never tried to make dates and times and Seasons I was telling Brother Gary and Brother Don a while ago that remember the series I preached a year or two ago I don't know how long it is cu you know old age just gets you and you lose all of it I reckon but couple of years ago I preached a message called faith and you know what I thought I thought i' probably got three or four more sermons to preach you know CU I kind of you and I thought when that finishes up the Rapture will be right there we'll be gone I thought that but I got down to the last couple of messages and I realized it it wouldn't going to take place I realized that what I was looking at was the beginning instead of the ending Brother Gary can relate to me easily because he called me one time and he thought I was really against him he he really thought I was taring down his bubble cuz he said brother Dale I see it this is the end this is all of it well I asked him a question or two about it you know and I said Brother Gary you just now saw the beginning well today he'll tell you that that's right but that day he didn't believe I was right but it wasn't that I God had showed me something it just the fact that I knew that see he was standing in the place I was standing and that that was you know that was it but see I will tell you like this I've told you many many times brother about 1971 somewhere right in there he preached a message and he came out one day and he was preaching on the uh you know Revelations 3:14 the beginning of the creation of God and uh he came out and he said brother Dale I just caught it the old building was across this way he looked across and I know where I sitting right there in the window you know and he said brother Dale this is the life message and I sat there for a second and I said amen because he wasn't saying that was the last [Music] sermon he's saying this is the last message the life message the message to this age is the beginning of the creation of God this is the last message I can say that today the beginning of the creation of God this is the life message God is not another message beyond that when you and I come into completeness of the the creation of God it'll all be over with that's right but then you see what I'm talking about maybe sometimes we've got faith for the time but you know Abraham held on what he had you know what it brought it brought a baby right right it brought a baby let's just hold on and let's kind of showing you where we're going let's go back to Hebrews 6 the very odd statements that Paul would make therefore which means wherefore or whatever something's fix to take place or what's going on we settle it down right here therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and a faith toward God now I'll read you a statement in a minute but you know we used to read that and that was mass confusion but anybody that's been in the message very long and at least read the Hebrew Book you can come up with a summation of things and answer what I would say Paul what are you saying therefore leaving the principles principles it's Beginnings right let us go on to Perfection the word Perfection there goes into the word completion Paul is saying therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to the change of these bodies right till everything is made manifest see now we have Carpenters with us anybody with one eye in high sense brother R used to say I we like that a good point but I mean any of the little kids in here you know that's few years old especially my kids grandkids or some something they they kind of know a little bit about work you know of laying a foundation or something now when you building a house you put down a foundation okay now you don't want that Foundation to crack now what happens if the foundation cracks you look at the foundation no you don't have to look at the foundation go inside the house right and walk around till you find a wall and there's a big old crack right down that especially if it's a concrete wall why something wrong your foundation right so in Christianity don't ever think no more than you would of a building in the building of a building you never leave the foundation everything in this building the tons that are setting upon it is setting on a foundation right if we had anything else it's setting on the foundation so never think about even in Christianity never think about leaving your foundation that's where the people of this message is going wrong the foundation of this message is the Bible right right now how can you take the Bible and get two Souls Two Lords River Jordan brues Etc how can you get that out of the Bible they would automatically admit you couldn't do it if you just had that alone but they have quotes and things that they think makes it able to be able to uh you know we used to have a joke that you know you'd say well what's going to hold that up and uh you said well just gets you a sky hook anybody ever heard that right this gets you a sky hook right well see it was plain enough to show you didn't I no sense because it ain't no such thing as a Skyhook cuz they Ain nowhere to hook it see it was just a way of life and making fun right but see that to me is the way the doctrines are if you can't come back to this Bible and show me your Doctrine in this Bible I see it right there then I believe you're sitting hanging your faith on a Skyhook right because it won't and they won't do it all right but you never leave your principal Foundation now the Bible says about Ephesians 2:20 that we're built on the foundation are the apostles and Prophets now that's just not fivefold Ministry prophets to me is Apostles New Testament prophets Old Testament Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone right right now the Chief Cornerstone is what you tie everything to you ought to go over to Israel walk down in a hole and look Neer Rock there man almost as big as this building and that's the foundation for the wall and the building of the where the the U Ark of the Covenant and all other things are supposed to be the temple CU you got to lay anything you got to put it on a foundation and the Bible talks about a sure Foundation you remember Jesus about putting it on Sand and how that carries of life and things wor build it on a good foundation you know and you can go right out in the desert and build your house but as quick as thing starts going wrong what's going to happen so what do you do the only way you can build it is you got to build it on a platform that would keep it from sinking or you're going to have to put Timbers down to get to something solid okay now we're built on the foundation of Apostles and Prophets Jes Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone now I want to relate two things together those Apostles I know what brother R said he said Paul was the only one that understood Jehovah the old was Jesus of the new all now but brother Randon you're not saying Peter and him didn't understand nothing so what are you saying Paul had a greater understanding right what do you think Peter believed Peter could explain to you probably all of the Jehovah Gyra Jehovah tishu Jehovah Raa he could explain all that cuz that's what he believed but he just didn't have the depth of believing that it would take the Paul to come forth with cuz Paul would be the one that would take us back and we would have a gauge to look and see if we were back on the face of the fathers now Paul never rebuked Peter for being off in Doctrine right no he rebuked him for his actions in life right because he believed exactly the same God right Paul and Peter had the same same Revelation but then why would Paul say leaving the principles of the doctrin of Christ so he's not saying leave it like throw it away get rid of it we don't need it anymore no what's he saying he's saying we're built on a foundation of Apostles and Prophets cuz he was the one that said that so here he's not saying leaving that he's saying go on right keep that as your foundation and go on now I've been bringing this up to this point to that we've been talking about the seven compound names of Jehovah that is a foundational structural Stone of the Old Testament would you agree amen you know that's the foundation of the Old Testament is the revealing of Jehovah God now was Paul and them saiding well we understand all about that we don't need that no more no no but Paul said leaving the principles he had explained the great things back through the scriptures but he seen that there was something wrong now what did he do he said upon our foundation that we have let us not just keep laying the foundation right you said well boy we got the foundation what are you doing now well we're laying another Foundation years later you said what are you doing now we're laying another Foundation now you going after a while you're going to sure have a high wall of foundation you know it's not needed that way but you lay your foundation you get it right and then you start from there then you put down the floor joy you put the flooring down you put down the studs you put down you know you start building a house right so that's leaving the principles that's leaving that foundation in the bases that you're going on all right see but you're not leaving it like setting it out in mid Irish you're the foundation but we set the house over here you no no no we don't believe in skyhooks but you see you got to go on to be able to build a house right now would that be the same thing as people pet saying now this is a quote from Brother BR where he said how Faith to be born again cuz he's talking about Statue of perfect man he said now you add to your faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience God in this what was he building a house right to go on and remember now if the man himself would be saying let's do this then he was teaching people to how to get where he was he wasn't saying Peter you already have it and let me teach you no he was trying to teach little babies to come to where he was cuz that was their purpose that was their faith for the time the faith for the time of the the apostles was to lay a foundation put Jesus Christ as the Chief Cornerstone try to build a body in the bases of Faith vers knowledge temp but then wait because Paul knew that the Rapture was not coming right then now you want scripture what was it they must come a falling away first right and the man of sin be revealed he knew it was not coming he says what the Lord himself one of these days is going to descend from heaven with a shout right brother Randon said he was trying to get it out of the people's mind that God was coming right then right but see we had that messed up cuz we had it Paul preaching him boy he was trying to get him to see card was right there Then Bo he just well might have stirred up a little in her energy but it was in the gospel they were not in the faith for the time the faith for the time was the Apostle Paul knowing that Jesus Christ was not coming right then now that's contrary to 99% of religious society that may be a very low number matter say 99.99 because see ever since I've been in this message they've been telling me when the Lord's coming he's going come in 73 he going 774 he going to come in 77 he's going to come in brother colle GRE in cuz we've been down through that he's going to come near he going everybody want to tell you when he's coming and Paul is telling them he ain't coming that's right settle down now not your fall s I tell what no settle down in what you got amen and hold fast is that know what the scripture say examine yourself to see whether you're in the faith or not hold fast cuz it's coming to persecution that's what Paul was telling see we think well Paul trying to BU no no no he was trying to tell them if they live long enough that's going to die for what they believed see we get it all messed up we preach Paul with the great thing and listen he did have a great faith I walked out here one day and I preached the message and I said according to what God has revealed to me there's going to be a lot of people die Believers in the message even born again Believers are going to die go by the grave because it's going to take something to stand there that last minute and be changed and listen folks every one of us in this building might be in that group that's going to go by the grave you don't give us much hope I don't I don't play games either I don't try to tell you how goody goody you are because you go to Lula right but now listen Paul said there was no other Foundation could be laid than what was already laid so now why I try to keep on laying on the foundation well all we need to preach is dress and hair and clothes this we'll get to that that you know what brother R called that dead Works hang around let's see if he said it dead Works cuz ain't one of them going to put you in in the body of Christ and ain't one of them going to save you they one of them going to put you in the Rapture okay now let's turn the story around but because you go do them things proves that you're not in the Rapture proves that you're not in the faith and proves that you're lost right see people don't like me to preach cuz that's just rough that that teares it down to the hide cuz it don't give you no place to hide does it well brother D just don't understand I've got this problem I got this problem what kind of a problem you got I thought we believed in a problem solver yeah you know but now follow me cuz I'm just trying to get a point to you Paul said leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection so now if he was right okay that's right then there must be a place somewhere that somebody sometime will reach right amen or he would have not said let us go on to a position a place of perfection but you know what he was just saying he was saying we ain't there yet right right cuz if he saying let us go on I said brother Tim let us go on to New York you know what that means we a there amen right say Welly it's good to be here see I'm trying to drive it down for you to think about what the scriptures say because the prophet says it like this and I'll give you these if you want them listen to what he had to say he said now le in the principles of the doctrines of Christ this is Hebrew series chapter 5 and 6 preach 1957 9:08 the morning service paragraph 174 through uh 180 in brown of Tabernacle I know we have healings that's wonderful we have visions oh that's that's fine yes spiritual dreams and sometimes they're not to spiritual dreams and sometimes you we try to help the poor we do what we can well that's all right but that's not what we're talking about now we're entering into another phase oh yes we got the doctrine of Christ we believe he was a Son of God and virgin born now listen he's tell you what he believes then he's telling you we need to go on we believe that with all these things that is wonderful but leaving that let us go into Perfection oh I wish I had the voice for an archangel now try to bring it to a place he said now what talking about the theologians and and all and all about how we believe in the deity of Christ how he was God made flesh and all these other things Paul goes on to explain it all here just in a moment but laying again to Foundation repentance of dead works we'll get back to this we believe in that Faith toward God we believe in that doctrine of baptisms and just how you must be baptized we believe that laying on the hands we believe in lay on the hands don't we Resurrection of the Dead We Believe fa see here we can believe in Eternal judgment you believe in Eternal judgment how do you believe but we need to go on amen H what do you mean I mean we've got these things laid what is your foundation of Apostles and Prophets one God water baptism baptism plural Holy Ghost baptism water baptism that's why it said baptisms we believe in the resurrection we believe in etern judgment now wait just a minute now how's it Eternal judgment well your Prophet explains it that the Judgment of God is eternal because once he judges that's it but there's not going to be an eternal judgment you we're going to set down in eternity and Jud no no there'll come a time that even The Sinner is destroyed right that's right put a judgment that way it's not not sitting down and just we're going to just have eternal judgment no it's meaning that once you're judged you're judged we don't believe in another judgment after this do we don't we believe that whatever we are here as the tree lean so will it fall as we say what we do here is our judgment right would you see he said we're entering into another phase laying the foundation get your water baptism right get your Holy Ghost baptism right get you revelation of God right get your judgment right get the resurrection right and then we got to go home got to go on to what we got to go on I'll use this scripture but I'll give it to you now he goes on in talking about you know if you sin willful after receiving the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice but it's impossible for those to Once enlightened and tasted the Heavenly gift to fall away you said yeah that's the way we believe it we believe it you ever tasted have it right you fall away it's impossible if you'd never be saved okay that's the way the prophet explained it we didn't have about him explain it like this he said Paul is telling you that if you've tasted the Heavenly gift and being partakers of the Holy Ghost it's impossible possible for you to ever fall right that's a little different other way say in name one of them is just looking at it as a you know the impossible if you'd ever be saved let's see that's question and answer on the Holy Ghost 1959 1219 now he's talking about what people looked at it it looks like the way we're reading it there that a man could receive the Holy Ghost and then back and then be then backslide and be lost and he said that's the way people think that's saying it but it's impossible for him to do that see he can't do it if he did Christ died now I'm reading what your prophecy it's impossible for those who once Enlighten what what's he speaking to he's speaking to those borderline Jews he never said a man being filled with the Holy Ghost he said he's tasted of the word of God but a man filled with the Holy Ghost it's impossible for him to be lost Hebrews 19 uh chapter 6 paragraph 214 57908 evening and we sometimes believe that that was the man who was once enlightened and fell away again but but the Bible doesn't read it that way it is absolutely impossible for a man he says here that has received the Holy Spirit to Ever Fall Away now if we're going on to Perfection then we would not be dealing with whether we're borderline Believers or not right if we're born line Believers we got a lot of problems right in other words if we're not born again we're going a lot problems amen cuz we have at least at Lula tasted of the word of God Amen we haven't been to six and seven sermons that goes on in a lot of churches or whatever they do and that's their business God has led us throughout the world but then you get all stuff shirt and boy bless God we got the word Lula well you just tasted amen you just tasted of the word because if you ever get the word and it revealed you would never make a statement like that you would never even think like that you would never think look what we've got cuz my Bible says everything you get you know what happens the Bible says you receive it ever notice your Prophet saying even the air we breathe is a blessing from God right amen everything we have we have received I work for mine well who woke you up as sister Johnny always says right who got you up to go to work right do you see what I'm trying to bring out is we think we understand a lot of things and Paul was saying therefore Le in the principles of the doctrines of Christ doctrine of baptism lay on the hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment well I why they call it Eternal judgment because once it's judged your that judgment is eternal you won't sit somewhere and wait for an eternity to get judged right you know in line down through there it means that whatever is Judge your judge already amen amen why can't we leave the principles but see then you got the arguments by everybody whether this is right or that is right this is right or that is right or like one man said one time he said to us he said well brother rand's not here to show us what's right well some of us told him said well we've got the books and texes well we don't know what that means oh my cuz the prophet is not here to tell us oh my well I don't I can read right right but the point I'm getting that are we going to just stay with the little simple things of the one God the water baptism no Eternal Hells or or things like that or are we going to try to go on Amen into affection W not laying again the foundation of dead works you mean you got to tell people I'll try to just close it this way people say well y'all just don't Brother D them Don't Preach about lul about women's dress and hair and stuff like that you don't preach you mean you got to tell B Born Again Believers let me quote brother brand you don't have to tell to ride one time that's his words you mean you got to preach every service on dress and hiring clothes but when are we going to leave the principles cuz won't you agree that that's at least a principal Point amen I mean I don't have to say a word to my wife ever since we come into this message I've never told her what clothes to wear our daughter Anna I never told her what clothes to wear well wife took care of the clothes until and I got old enough she went to school and they told her said you're going to have to dress out or you a fail to class you know in physical education first time I called up which was a friend of mine was principal I called him up and I said well you know we got a problem here and he said what I said my daughter don't wear no pants or stuff likeu that she's been told that she would fail a class if she didn't dress out he said I'll take care of it he took her out of that class I said listen I'm not trying to get you to teaching my daughter to be lazy or anything I said you make her do anything she can do in the dress she can run she can do things she wind up playing uh tennis and stuff like that with a dress on see we say but now the teacher the school says that you got to dress out we'll challenge the school anytime you want to and we won't even mention the Bible would would you say we don't believe in word girls wording you mean you're telling me that I I can't believe that you know not even putting religion in it we're just talking natural so now if you're going to do that then how can you have a school that forces girls to wear skirts and boys to wear pants have plenty of them a you dress codes you know we call it right but you see they're not going to bother you it's your flimsy excuse but but you don't want to put yourself on the line I told him that he said Sam don't worry about it he said we got a family here they don't wear pants either they'll be taken care of well you know the next year they come up with L this and and I just took care of the F staff what become part of her by then but you see if that's all we've got this hiring clothes and whether or not we to be stealing or cheating or smoking or running around with women or if that's all we got to talk about that ain't even the principles Paul was saying that ought to be done by the new birth right [Music] he said well I bless God like one man said when time said you ain't going to die and go to hell for killing the deer on Sunday I said no you tell your son that you die and go to hell because of unbelief solve that problem you mean it's no no no because run around said if you're out in the woods the way back where you can't go to church he said go ahead not on Sunday not going to die and go to hell for smoking or drinking or running around with women no you're not going to do it you're going to go to hell for unbelief why cuz it proves what you're doing right that ain't even the principles Paul never even covered that that's what I never have figured out I know I'm M for but I never figured out how they so much higher en closed and even two-tone shoes could be preached out of a Bible that I've never read that in or wearing watches or long sleeves or and you know I've never read it in the Bible I don't understand that cuz that ain't even the principles Paul is saying the principles is the one God the water baptism and no eternal hell what 90% of the people in this message preach as being the message it's not even the principles of the Apostle Paul well we don't have time fool in deep things you Paul said one God faith toward God doctrine of Christ when we got time for the Deep things no you ain't got time because you're not in the body you're not in the the correct order when we get down and preach what Paul preached in Hebrews 6 then you will be capable of leaving it cuz you can't leave it until you stand there oh my come on you can't leave the principles until you lay the principles right amen you're hanging your your thing in the sky hook that's why these doctrines won't fit that's what I told my wife the other day I said thank God that you can know the truth and the truth has kept you from going into error you don't never thank him for that oh bless God I kep say I don't agree with that cuz I know too much about the devil and how tricky he is but you see what most people think is the Christian thing is is even down below the principles that Paul is bringing and should not even have to be talked on other than newcomers and newcomers you know it's kind of odd around here that I don't preach on that all the time and we get newcomers and they come in sh and and they go get a [Laughter] haircut and nobody had said nothing here about it now I don't know where boing them or not but none of us didn't say nothing about it had a big old here ring in his ear I didn't say a word to him but you know what all you got to do just walk around and look right you say well that must be the dress code right right that must be the dress code so I need to dress like that that's not even Christianity his sister used to live back here I she's passed him she came here when the word said to her brother Mo pretty well like I am he didn't preach a lot on stuff he just tried to preach the Bible she came here one night she went back home she got her snuff box and she opened that Li up and she's d get in there cuz of what she used to doing she's a good old Baptist you know where they all get stuff and smok and things she said it made her sick had nobody preached against it it made her sick she said God if that's you and you want me to get rid of that to take away all the problems and needs and all she set the snuff box up on the fallboard you know how most of us are put them cigarettes man how many times you ever took them out the pocket now I never did smoke so I don't how many times yall ever take them out of your pocket sling them down across the field throw them in the trash can stop on and say I won't smoke another one and you headed to the store right you headed to buy some a got nothing you want see and everybody says well throw them away you know what I've always told you Brothers never talk sister about smoking cuz I had no problem with it but and I tell you same thing you know what to do with them just put them in your pocket and carry them around right saves you a lot of trouble exactly right cuz you ain't going to have to go buy no more that's right you got it handy right she set it up on the faboard sat there for months and months he finally throw it away that's the way you do it no nobody had never condemned her of a thing we don't believe in that kind of a doing though do [Music] we so I believe in God condemning you amen and then it'll work right right but he okay get off that get to Med but now listen you understand I'm going to quit right there leaving the principles Paul says so then what most of people claim to be the message of the hour the quote that's going to take us in the Rapture Etc is not even preaching in any form on the principles that Paul said for us to leave you see folks you think I like to talk like that I know I have to live with myself I got enough problems I got enough troubles I have to live myself that's why I don't have no big thing of beating on you about something I do everything I can to try to get you in some way to see it without me having to say it right cuz I've never seen it till this day that when getting on to somebody oh yeah you just bring it out you don't know you they'll they'll straighten up won't be long and go right back like I said you stomp the cigarettes you can take them out and you wind up going right back to K cuz you didn't get delivered listening last night not for last one you know in the truck I guess where brother Randon was explaining about the U the girl that he had went to pray for her she was real beautiful she was in a some kind of a what you call it nothing house and uh she was you know wanted him to pray with her he said he got down and said they prayed and he prayed said she had told him just before then said brother Bram said many times said I tried to straighten up and do what was right I said I just couldn't do it he said well let's just pray she got down she prayed she got up said well brother BR I think I got it this time and something like that you know I think it'll be all right said he called her on the shoulder and said sister let's pray CU see he knew she didn't get it but she said she did he said we got back down and said she got to pray and said after a while he said she entered into something and boy she was praying he said when she got up she didn't have no more trouble with that amen then wound up making somebody I think he said making somebody a beautiful wife because she prayed through but you see maybe we need to pray through sometimes instead of instead of just saying thank you Lord jump up and take off I heard brother R say one time said you ever sat there long enough to listen see if God wants to talk to you said you spend your time talking to him did you ever just listen sometimes see if he wants to talk to you no I ain't got time about right in it but see fades for the time you and I got to have enough faith for a Rapture amen amen but we can't play around with clothes and hiring whether to drink or smoke or run around we we can't play around with that and even talk about Paul and we got to get to the place of leing the principles and go on to Perfection right amen let's Stand Together a communion time they under you ter coming down to communion time we need to make sure our heart's right everything's right before we take the communion because we don't we read the Scripture it says we drink damnation to our own body you know our own self he let's take what we've got and move on and there comes to tomorrow we listen again for another word and we move on give us this day our daily bread we keep rising to one day like I said about Enoch Enoch walked up that pyramid until he just went out the top and he just went on up in the air that may be the way we're going to do walk right up through the skies brother Mo used to illustrate it he said I don't think the life step is going to be a great big one you know you got to run and get ready jump no just be another step one more step amen but don't step brother R Dalton had a dream and brother Brown told him he had a dream that like stoned out in the water and you know when they first would come up they would be real slick you know in the natural you know it would be moss and slick on and said he saw in a dream that he would it would come up and then he seen another you know just like that and he had to walk across this place and said brother random told him said brother do take one step at a time he said step on that stone but said don't quickly step on that next one he said because it' be slick he said Whit it dries and then you step over on it see that's the way to get across cuz once it dries you're safe let's just walk one step at a time okay let's go into the communion for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him meat at home that you come not together you come not together in condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come let's just do as the prophet said let's just have a few moments of Silent prayer praying one for the other and especially you praying for me is what he said pray for you Pastor before we go into this let's get all minds and hearts clear to where that we can stand before God father just bless each one Let Your Love be made manifest to each one of us we love you and we thank you in Jesus name the Bible said he took the bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread It's Made for This purpose today that we may be able to partake of these things we pray that you would just sanctify the bread and the partakers that we may all be together as one in you we know this is not your body it is only in representation we don't believe it becomes the literal because we're not concerned about it but it does represent you Lord sanctify the bread and the partakers in Jesus name amen I like to break all of it CU it was a broken body and that way then we we know know for assurity what it represents we don't hold it over we try to burn the bread and everything before another day transmits because we don't want to believe that we're trying to hold over we want the bread each day you say well we got this message a lot of people quit taking communion because they believe that brother Brandon brought the message and that ended that I don't believe it that way I believe that we're still to take it until he comes is what he said father we ask you to same s ify this wine we thank you that you Lord are the the one that would reveal it unto us what this is all about bless the wine Sanctified and Lord Jesus as we eat the little piece of bread and we drink this wine tomorrow that will make blood cells in our body that we could live by it Lord how much more would it make in us to make the revelation of the hour that we're living in the time we love you and we thank you thank you Father wine and and the bread and all of us together is one in you in Jesus name amen come morning I by the river I'll [Music] carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory [Music] for sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and strength to go on come morning I walk by the river I'll rest me the Ever Green [Music] Glory I never take the communion that I don't think about the children of Israel in their last night you know they they had a natural meal just like the disciples GA they had a natural meal at the eight but then at the end of it there was things back there they done that would be a typ and things and shadows you know and probably didn't understand the way they were doing but and it did it would represent what the Lord Jesus because when it come to the end of it then he he took the bread blessed it took the wine blessed it and he said this is the New Testament in my blood you know right then he was setting in order something that would be real something that would be you know in the correct order but then 2000 years we've been taking communion but one of these days when it's all over with and we get on the other side you know what the marriage supper is going to be the communion that' be something would it will we be in a hurry to go home you know well now brother Dale hurry it up because it's about 7 minutes till 4 we got to hurry up and go home it won't be any of those problems then will it we'll have eternity that we can take take one communion be a wonderful time wonderful hour don't don't ask me to explain it because I thought see we already had it in our idea that that the former things would be passed away you know we wouldn't remember nothing we do anything brother Rand said you know what would happen we'd be sitting at the at the marriage supper at the table he said we' realized it maybe so and so made it and he said Jesus would come down through and wipe the tears out of our eyes that won be tears of Sorrow will it be tears of joy a lot of difference in it in let's partake together you can be seated for a minute when we get ready to do the foot washing we read from John 13th chapter and verse 2 supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas his carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter Sith unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet J Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter Sith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said unto him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every with and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and taken his garments and was sat down again he said unto them know you what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater
