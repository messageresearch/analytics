[26:46] Jesus name
[26:48] amen
[26:51] Revelations 20.
[26:53] now I spoke a little bit on this about
[26:56] you know a couple of weeks ago about the
[26:58] uh the writing of the Bible that I
[27:01] didn't get through with it so I wanted
[27:03] to come back and maybe pick it up on
[27:06] I'm doing again but just
[27:09] we'll try anyway to go forth verse 20
[27:12] Revelations
[27:13] chapter 20 verse 11.
[27:17] and it's all about Chrome a great white
[27:19] throne and him that set on it from whom
[27:23] face the earth and the heaven fled away
[27:25] and there was found no place for them
[27:28] all the dead small and great stand
[27:30] before God and the books were opened and
[27:33] another book was opened which is The
[27:34] Book of Life and the dead were judged
[27:37] out of those things which were written
[27:39] in the books according to their works
[27:42] now I just want to read Daniel because
[27:43] it's the same thing but you know just to
[27:47] tie it together Daniel 7 verse 9 and 10.
[27:52] I'll be held till the Thrones were cast
[27:55] down and the ancient days did sit whose
[27:58] garment was white as snow and the hair
[27:59] of his head like the pure wool his
[28:02] strong was like the fiery flame and his
[28:05] wheels as burning fire
[28:07] a fire extreme issued and came forth
[28:09] before him thousands thousand thousand
[28:13] thousands ministered unto him and Ten
[28:16] Thousand Times Ten thousands stood
[28:18] before him the Judgment was set and the
[28:21] books were opened you may be seated Lord
[28:25] at his Blessing to the reading of the
[28:27] word
[28:30] now
[28:32] as I said I spoke
[28:35] about this
[28:36] on the message a few weeks ago there on
[28:40] the writing of the Bible
[28:43] and what we're doing is I want to do
[28:46] this message especially maybe one more
[28:48] uh on kind of
[28:52] taking what we were talking about as to
[28:55] happening throughout the messages there
[28:58] that we were preaching on what was
[28:59] taking place in heaven
[29:02] and you know we saw a good many things
[29:05] took place there so we want to uh you
[29:08] know get into that and and uh
[29:11] kind of try to cover some of it but what
[29:13] I want to do now is to bring that down
[29:15] to earth
[29:17] because we can talk about what would
[29:19] happen in heaven and and that's fine and
[29:22] that can be revealed to us but in
[29:25] reality you know we as human peoples
[29:29] uh like you know we're looking where we
[29:32] are and things like that we wasn't back
[29:35] dire
[29:36] but we have come down here to live out
[29:39] our journey all right and in doing that
[29:41] then
[29:42] um you know it's actually seeing we're
[29:45] actually seeing what took place
[29:48] that's what I want you to see is is what
[29:50] was shown in heaven as to would take
[29:53] place
[29:54] now where that was that was you know the
[29:57] the writing of the book uh like we'll
[30:00] get to in a minute about you know the
[30:02] the doings and the things and the
[30:04] morning Stars sang together the sons of
[30:06] God shouted for Joy the the different
[30:08] things that took place
[30:10] see if that doesn't take place here
[30:14] then how do we know
[30:16] whether or not there is a real reality
[30:19] of what took place in heaven
[30:21] now that that's that's my point if you
[30:23] don't get nothing else out of the
[30:25] message for the next couple of messages
[30:27] anyway is to get this point
[30:31] you and I are living in a Time
[30:34] when the the end of all things has come
[30:39] now and in doing that then we are the
[30:43] finality or the finishing up of all
[30:46] things okay all right and if if we can
[30:51] see the day that we're living
[30:53] and what's actually taking place
[30:57] it's fine to talk about what took place
[31:00] here what you know about Abraham and his
[31:03] journey and all but you know he wasn't
[31:05] there
[31:06] right that's right but we're here all
[31:09] right well now I'd rather be here than
[31:11] back dark I mean it's been wonderful to
[31:15] to experience those things of life and
[31:18] all that would have been great but still
[31:20] I'd rather be here
[31:22] because see all of that points to here
[31:27] right right and see then that that's my
[31:29] whole point I want us to see the reality
[31:31] and get as I was saying this morning
[31:33] that that do we have a negative
[31:36] confession or do we have a positive
[31:38] attitude right
[31:40] yeah all right I hope you followed that
[31:42] part of the message that I was trying to
[31:43] say that that
[31:45] anything
[31:47] below the fact of being very positive
[31:50] would have to be negative
[31:53] no matter how much it would be they
[31:54] would we were back there and we believed
[31:56] in God and we followed after God we we
[31:59] serve God we we went to church and and
[32:02] we've done all kind of things and that
[32:04] was wonderful I mean great you know
[32:06] enjoyed being there
[32:08] but now it's the most enjoyable of all
[32:12] because you realize that we're just
[32:15] maybe one heartbeat away from a Rapture
[32:18] you know what changed the moment twinkle
[32:19] of an eye now we know people say we've
[32:22] been in the Rapture all the way down
[32:23] well that's fine that's all right but
[32:25] there has to be come to a place
[32:27] and we're here to that we're just
[32:31] seconds away from
[32:34] the most glorious thing that has ever
[32:36] happened our excuse me that ever will
[32:39] happen
[32:41] upon the Earth
[32:42] it would be you and I walk off of this
[32:45] Earth
[32:46] in a redeemed body amen all right see
[32:49] then we should be more in you know more
[32:53] happier or enjoyable now than we was 30
[32:57] years ago yes amen then we watched 10
[32:59] years ago
[33:01] then we watch when we're the Badness and
[33:03] the methodists and all like that coming
[33:04] down we should be a whole lot happier
[33:07] because we're in the end time
[33:11] I mean we're just maybe seconds away
[33:13] from seeing our Lord and savior right
[33:16] right why wouldn't we want to be happy
[33:19] the one who died for us paid the price
[33:22] all this it's just and every second we
[33:25] go is one more second closure amen see
[33:30] we we come down through time evening you
[33:32] know you're like kids you know uh they
[33:35] they get up you know after they come up
[33:37] a little bit in life and and you can can
[33:40] ask them how old they are well I'm 12
[33:43] and a half
[33:44] bro well you ask them you know when
[33:46] they're about eight or ten or something
[33:47] what how ten
[33:49] but see there's an urgency gets within
[33:52] the bot I mean the the child to where
[33:55] that is actually wanting to be older
[33:58] than what it is because they'll say well
[34:00] I I'm 13 and I 13 four months and three
[34:05] days to be exact you know something like
[34:07] that because it puts an urgency
[34:12] you know you want to get rich 16. right
[34:14] where you can drive a car right oh man
[34:17] something like that you know or or grow
[34:20] up you know well I I
[34:22] I don't understand why the urgency of
[34:26] the end time of the message or the hour
[34:29] there is an urgency within my heart in
[34:31] life now to to draw closer to realize
[34:36] reality of a of a change of things that
[34:41] are taking place
[34:43] I'm more happy today about the message
[34:45] than I've ever been and I've always been
[34:48] happy about it that's why I said this
[34:49] morning and I mean it I wish nobody
[34:51] would come and show me where I've always
[34:53] had a positive attitude about this
[34:55] message
[34:56] I've always been up to the bases that I
[34:58] wanted to know and see but I want to
[35:00] know and see what's going on
[35:03] right you know I love to read about
[35:06] what's going on now
[35:08] what went on in history is fine that's
[35:10] fine but I'm I'm living right here right
[35:14] right and I want to see that see and
[35:16] that's the point that
[35:18] we could talk about heaven and oh we we
[35:21] was there and we've done this well we
[35:23] wasn't there as reality of people we
[35:26] realized that right sure that was in the
[35:28] mind of God and that's greater than any
[35:30] thoughts we could ever think of our own
[35:32] being natural
[35:33] I used to be in but still we're here
[35:37] right where it's going to be finished at
[35:40] this is not going to be finished in
[35:42] heaven
[35:44] right right Heaven's coming here amen so
[35:48] this is the reality of getting here in
[35:51] the end time and and that's what I want
[35:53] your mind to be thinking about see that
[35:56] we're looking at what is now taking
[35:58] place
[36:01] you can look back and see what took
[36:03] place
[36:04] you look forward to hoping what will
[36:06] take place
[36:08] but what about what what's taking place
[36:10] right now right
[36:12] right this is the most important day
[36:14] that you've ever lived right man is this
[36:16] day
[36:18] before we can see things all right now
[36:20] as I said when we were preaching on it
[36:23] that when we were talking about being in
[36:25] heaven for about seven or eight messages
[36:27] and things that one day we would come to
[36:30] Earth
[36:31] and and that we would make a journey
[36:34] but the journey on Earth would have to
[36:36] exactly match
[36:39] me
[36:41] that was that we could see in heaven
[36:43] right all right now
[36:46] it didn't show us in heaven
[36:50] in partial realization
[36:55] are you listening
[36:56] yes I want the plot I want this thought
[36:58] in mind
[36:59] when we talked about being in heaven all
[37:01] of those services
[37:03] none of that was in partial realization
[37:08] God didn't write now to listen to the
[37:11] point now don't misunderstand me
[37:14] God didn't write about
[37:17] in the book
[37:19] about the the things of life
[37:24] you only see the Lamb's Book of Life
[37:28] the book of the lamb slain before the
[37:31] foundation of the world to be exactly
[37:33] what we're reading
[37:36] see it doesn't show
[37:38] life on Earth
[37:42] it shows a finished Complete product
[37:45] positive already done
[37:49] morning stars sing together sons of God
[37:51] shouting for joy
[37:54] about the Plan of Redemption
[37:58] not that would take place on Earth
[38:04] but that was a reality
[38:06] of real
[38:09] right
[38:10] but now
[38:12] is I tried to preach back a few years
[38:14] ago on a message called matching pieces
[38:17] and if you want to go back into computer
[38:19] you can run across it and pull up the
[38:22] older services and get it
[38:24] and my point then was the same as it is
[38:26] now
[38:30] when a Time Came Upon the Earth that a
[38:33] man was needed
[38:34] Martin Luther came on the Earth
[38:38] right right
[38:39] man I wouldn't have Hazard time or
[38:42] doings
[38:44] and as it did
[38:46] then he began to preach
[38:49] to serve God
[38:51] it's like John Wesley
[38:54] he believed Luther's message and he came
[38:56] to America to convert the Indians
[38:59] missionary enough
[39:01] but when he got over here he ran into
[39:04] the moravians or how you pronounced that
[39:06] word and he uh
[39:09] he ran into those people and you know
[39:11] they taught him the way of
[39:12] sanctification right
[39:14] but you know their message of
[39:16] sanctification never turned the world
[39:17] upside down all right
[39:19] because God was waiting on Martin was
[39:21] waiting on John Wesley just as he's
[39:24] waiting on Martin Luther right right A
[39:26] lot of people protested the Catholic
[39:28] Church before Martin Luther ever did
[39:31] but yet they was not the man of God to
[39:34] fit the Bible that said would take place
[39:36] right all right see then here comes the
[39:40] man with the message
[39:42] inheritance starts rejoicing
[39:45] but see it wasn't necessarily written
[39:48] even of Martin Luther John Wesley
[39:50] Pentecost Etc
[39:54] it was showing the end of all things
[39:57] and that was the point I was trying to
[39:59] get you to see in in the messages back
[40:01] there about what I'm talking about
[40:03] matching pieces years ago and also where
[40:06] I just got through preaching about uh
[40:08] the things taking place in heaven all of
[40:11] that is a positive
[40:13] complete finished product
[40:16] right
[40:18] but see we're down here on Earth now
[40:21] because it was a time that had to come
[40:23] to Earth
[40:25] and then we have to live here
[40:28] what was that
[40:30] right you see God was waiting as I said
[40:32] on a man named Martin Luther to come up
[40:35] to a place and preached and done all
[40:37] kind of things
[40:38] but then all at once he struck
[40:41] the just shall live by faith
[40:43] well that was the positive of Luther's
[40:46] message right right
[40:48] and that was what God was waiting on
[40:50] Amen was that man to step out there
[40:54] he had been spoken in the Bible about
[40:57] a lot of you were coming in time all
[41:00] right right
[41:01] you see that couldn't take place
[41:04] it could do in in Elijah and Elisha and
[41:07] John the Baptist
[41:10] but it couldn't be the Elijah of Malachi
[41:13] 4.
[41:14] but see one day that scripture became a
[41:18] reality on Earth amen right when that
[41:22] positive came to Earth
[41:24] and struck in a man's heart
[41:26] then he could start the message
[41:29] right right you know and Proclaim this
[41:30] end time message all right so then God
[41:33] was waiting
[41:35] he's been waiting on a bride
[41:39] to come in the end time
[41:41] to be able to take that message
[41:44] and no matter what goes on out there or
[41:47] anywhere
[41:48] and she just keeps going right on down
[41:49] the road right man
[41:52] why because she's predestinated
[41:56] this is your day and you're our church
[41:58] when are we going to believe it that way
[42:00] right and when are we going to get out
[42:02] of our negativisms of oh well you know
[42:05] look out there and see this and do that
[42:08] no
[42:10] when we're going to get down to reality
[42:11] of what the Bible says right of Who We
[42:14] Are
[42:16] it's fine to talk about brother Adam was
[42:19] a prophet that's wonderful
[42:20] and there's people still accepting that
[42:23] you know
[42:25] you know coming into the Nations you
[42:27] believe in it that's fine
[42:29] but what about those who have been in
[42:31] the message a long time
[42:34] are we still just running around and
[42:36] around Mount Horeb
[42:38] of God sent a prophet God sent a prophet
[42:41] or is it time to go into the promised
[42:43] land right right see which way is it all
[42:46] right now see matching pieces
[42:49] in other words to look at something dire
[42:52] and see it here
[42:55] now
[42:57] not just to see it in partial
[42:59] realization that's get my point now
[43:04] there has to be an end time people there
[43:06] was a time that uh that you mentioned
[43:09] that
[43:10] we believe right around was a prophet
[43:12] but it's time to get into what the
[43:14] prophet had to say and it's about
[43:15] crucifying men that's right I mean you
[43:18] know they're just about ready to Stone
[43:19] you
[43:20] because you was out of the message
[43:23] the message was God said the prophet
[43:25] when I believe that
[43:27] and I believe it's unfolding I like
[43:29] Christ The Mystery of God revealed would
[43:31] run around and said
[43:32] that how the mystery had unfolded itself
[43:35] down to the present hour
[43:38] he said that we're living right was it
[43:41] the message is unfolded now it's down to
[43:43] the bride amen amen and the bride
[43:46] realizing who she is
[43:48] all right that's what's matching up in
[43:50] heaven because it didn't say in heaven
[43:53] when the messenger of Malachi 4 begins
[43:55] to shout
[43:57] you know the morning starts singing
[43:58] together
[44:00] he's part of it because he part of the
[44:02] body of Christ amen would you get my
[44:04] point yes
[44:07] yes it doesn't even say in the Bible
[44:09] that the prophet of God is for the
[44:10] perfecting of the Saints right
[44:13] that's right right
[44:15] it says the fivefold ministry is
[44:19] now without the message to be brought
[44:21] what would we have to bring that's right
[44:23] right so everybody's in the right place
[44:24] right Glory Hallelujah get ready against
[44:29] the day
[44:30] but now trying to see our part of the
[44:33] journey
[44:35] that could bring us not to a partial
[44:38] realization
[44:42] but to bring us to a positive attitude
[44:44] right
[44:47] bringing it down to a perfect
[44:48] realization that we can see the day that
[44:51] we're living Prophet preached that
[44:53] message from what recognizing your day
[44:57] in his message
[44:59] as I said this morning now
[45:02] the Bible says to
[45:04] believe in your heart
[45:06] invest with your mouth right right you
[45:08] believe in the heart don't say it with a
[45:10] mouth no good right right that's right
[45:12] say it with a mouth don't really believe
[45:13] in the heart no good
[45:15] all right when I show isn't in here that
[45:18] we get down to
[45:20] see recognizing your day
[45:23] amen
[45:25] and it's message and we know the message
[45:29] right God has sent us the message by the
[45:31] prophet right but do you recognize today
[45:33] that we're living come on
[45:36] well things are just getting so bad what
[45:38] do you think it's supposed to be
[45:42] I mean you expected to get better
[45:45] um
[45:46] I remember years ago here in the prophet
[45:48] make a statement and it was outstanding
[45:50] to me
[45:51] because he said you put a George
[45:53] Washington Abraham Lincoln in every
[45:56] office in this country
[45:58] that's right and can't pull it out right
[46:00] amen now they run a long time with
[46:03] George Washington the Abraham Lincoln
[46:05] and them keeping it fairly straight
[46:07] right
[46:08] but he said you put one in every office
[46:10] in other words you realize
[46:12] that every office you'd go to to pay you
[46:16] taxes to to do you this to go to that
[46:19] the judges and the Supreme Court and
[46:21] everybody in the Congress and the Senate
[46:24] and every one of them George Washington
[46:25] and Abraham Lincoln
[46:28] you said you can't believe
[46:31] he saw that it was gone
[46:35] and then you couldn't do it
[46:37] you said yeah but we just had two or
[46:39] three of them what good would it do
[46:43] you know would it be nice to be able to
[46:45] to the next election for governor we
[46:48] said we're going to let George
[46:49] Washington for Governor State of Georgia
[46:51] well what good would that do
[46:54] you wouldn't change nothing
[46:57] but you see Church we're in the time
[47:00] when it's becoming to the position
[47:02] listen this is my whole point of the
[47:05] evening we're coming to the place I
[47:07] believe that we're matching what was in
[47:09] heaven written about us amen now if not
[47:13] when we're going to come to it that's
[47:14] right
[47:15] 40 more years
[47:18] most of us ain't gonna be here that's
[47:21] right
[47:22] right language
[47:25] some of us might be here but we're going
[47:28] to have to be rolled in by wheelchair
[47:31] all right
[47:34] well when are we going to start saying
[47:36] what it is
[47:38] right it doesn't matter to me who's
[47:39] president of the United States
[47:42] I don't vote for nothing why
[47:44] could've found out
[47:45] about the last time I tried to vote I
[47:47] voted Catholic in office
[47:49] no 1964 somewhere about there when we
[47:52] voted Kennedy again
[47:54] I ain't voted Simpson on the
[47:56] presidential election
[47:58] I'm telling you not to I'm just telling
[48:00] you where I stand right right well what
[48:02] good is it
[48:04] amen what good is it what does it do
[48:07] well I tried well amen you ain't go to
[48:12] no good
[48:14] don't worry about it go on vote do what
[48:16] you want to
[48:17] but just to remember one thing
[48:21] the Bible says I put in Kings and I take
[48:24] out peace now
[48:28] if you can't see that little statement
[48:31] in John F Kennedy now I'm not against
[48:33] anyone I'm not against anyone
[48:36] but when the machines put him in office
[48:39] right if you can't see that God done
[48:42] that crook
[48:50] but he just allowed them to do it right
[48:53] because he wanted the man in there right
[48:56] we got the man in there we're supposed
[48:57] to have and we go for the next election
[49:00] without a woman supposed time that's
[49:01] right
[49:04] you say praise God remember who he is
[49:06] he's going to do what he's supposed to
[49:07] do that's right amen you're putting
[49:09] Putin back and what's his name back in
[49:12] over in Russia
[49:13] and he's very happy
[49:15] you know he's very tough
[49:17] well
[49:19] to what brother Ron said we got a bomb
[49:21] like what coming from there
[49:25] but see church I'm just trying to talk
[49:27] to you about this look at life and we
[49:30] can see
[49:32] I remember way back when running around
[49:35] him was I was reading one day and we was
[49:37] talking about it that he said watch when
[49:40] Russia come down after that oil
[49:45] well they're over after you
[49:49] when you see Jerusalem compassion I
[49:51] don't ever sound we're over there just
[49:52] goes everybody else
[49:54] we over fight for oil like everybody
[49:56] else finds role
[49:59] so what does it matter
[50:03] it's not that it's whether or not we're
[50:05] prepared for a Rapture that's it amen
[50:08] you know
[50:09] it's our matching pieces it's not the
[50:12] government who's doing what
[50:14] it's whether or not we can match the
[50:16] word of God right
[50:20] when I'm getting paid the other day
[50:22] where he said that this bride will prove
[50:24] to Satan that she won't fall like Eve
[50:27] well you know what somebody ain't gonna
[50:29] prove it to him
[50:31] why not we contend we're part of it amen
[50:36] and start saying it
[50:38] all right and we talked about in the
[50:41] message when we were talking of the
[50:42] writing of the Bible
[50:44] that uh
[50:46] what was taking place on Earth is
[50:48] written actually in the Bible
[50:51] right right
[50:54] now
[50:55] being written in the Bible it has a lot
[50:58] of things the Bible is a wonderful book
[51:00] and it's taught man how to put
[51:05] shifts into space because they told him
[51:08] where the day missing was that they
[51:10] found out it was by their own doings
[51:13] is the answer to all things
[51:16] it tells you how to do everything right
[51:19] written in the Bible
[51:22] because it's a wonderful book
[51:25] right then when we get to this place of
[51:27] looking at it that that
[51:30] you know Daniel says books
[51:35] Revelation says books
[51:38] all right
[51:41] this Bible has got many things in it
[51:43] it's many books
[51:45] because it's a book of life
[51:48] of mankind upon the Earth it gives you
[51:51] as a selfie then it gives you so much
[51:55] so you can get a record of
[51:59] you know
[52:01] and come all the way down through Who
[52:03] belongs to who
[52:05] when it's a record book
[52:07] it tells you about where you are where
[52:10] you came from born in sin Shepherd and
[52:12] iniquity spouse your mother's womb alive
[52:14] tells you all about life
[52:17] in one book
[52:19] but the reason it's called books
[52:23] is because it's just one book
[52:25] but it's got many sections of that book
[52:27] right
[52:29] that deals with the natural life and
[52:31] then it tells you about how to become
[52:33] into other parts of life and then it
[52:36] tells you about the Lamb's Book of Life
[52:38] all in one book
[52:41] it's a record it won't have to be books
[52:44] piled up and quiet throne
[52:47] it won't even really be a King James
[52:49] version now if you think it is that's
[52:52] not exactly what he's talking about you
[52:55] are the book
[52:58] you're the one that will be sitting on
[53:00] the throne with him
[53:02] and sitting there you'll be the book
[53:05] you won't have to turn into pages and
[53:07] find somebody's name
[53:10] you'll be the book ER written officials
[53:13] remember how he was trying to bring it
[53:14] out
[53:15] but in that I kind of just left a little
[53:17] bit that I I want you to think about
[53:22] let's just read a little bit what wrote
[53:23] around had to say
[53:25] now remember what I'm talking about is
[53:27] one book
[53:28] with many sections of it
[53:31] and it's called The Book of Life
[53:34] all right
[53:36] it's natural life
[53:39] Now Catch the middle it is a it will
[53:41] show a an area in between
[53:45] then it will show spiritual life
[53:48] all in the same Bible
[53:51] you don't have to be books laying out to
[53:53] be read from so listen to what you
[53:54] probably had to say on the invisible
[53:56] Union of the bride of Christ number one
[54:00] see then he's coming down talking about
[54:02] the bride and she's part of the you know
[54:04] part of the bridegroom and always but
[54:07] here's what he said here it brings into
[54:09] view the two books because this
[54:10] invisible Union was preached after the
[54:13] church age book was putting out now he
[54:15] put a put out uh so you'll read it in
[54:19] here
[54:20] the two boats is going to be mysterious
[54:22] when you read the book of The Seven
[54:24] Church ages
[54:27] the two books book of life said said one
[54:31] says you can put your name on it
[54:34] you never you never comes off other one
[54:38] says you take his name out of The Book
[54:40] of Life
[54:42] this brings it perfectly in Beauty right
[54:44] here I'm going to stop a few minutes and
[54:46] get this and and we'll catch up
[54:48] it's one two books
[54:52] there's going to be mysterious
[54:54] now yet it's not two books we'll read
[54:57] that on down here in just a minute
[54:59] it's one book
[55:01] right but with many sections of the same
[55:03] book
[55:04] to be able to come forward all right now
[55:07] when we get to the end because that's
[55:09] the point we want to do go ahead to the
[55:10] next one that was paragraph 205 we're
[55:12] going to 206.
[55:14] life is a sacred thing to God and it's
[55:17] recorded in the book
[55:18] not at the author of Life do you believe
[55:20] that congregation division our natural
[55:23] out here we have is just a perversion it
[55:26] really should be the right life to begin
[55:28] with but it's perverted by the natural
[55:29] word
[55:30] the first life or your first Union you
[55:33] were joined in Birth by Nature a natural
[55:35] act a human being associated man and
[55:37] woman together Associated together in
[55:39] sex so far which brought your first life
[55:41] and that's associated with sin and death
[55:43] and he said I don't see how you could
[55:45] miss seeing it but look what he said
[55:47] life is sacred
[55:51] God keeps a record right
[55:54] you've heard the prophet say that when
[55:56] you come up in an age and got to the age
[55:58] of accountability that God put a record
[56:00] on
[56:03] he said not much is written in your
[56:05] first part of your life
[56:07] but since then things begin to be
[56:10] recorded
[56:12] all right if we don't repent
[56:15] we're gonna have to face that
[56:18] but if we repent as Christians and get
[56:20] our slate cleaned as we'll cover in a
[56:22] little while
[56:23] all right
[56:25] but then as Christians it don't give us
[56:27] a right and just go out and do like we
[56:28] want to there's still records man
[56:32] that we've got to repent but if we don't
[56:34] he said well what do you mean you tell
[56:36] them how clean by the blood then you're
[56:38] telling me I'm not clean
[56:40] you're not cleaning to do anything you
[56:42] want to all right man my heaven what
[56:46] would that be
[56:48] all right so what's what he says now
[56:52] once you can get to the book now
[56:56] so go ahead with number
[57:00] two because all of that was number one
[57:03] this is from works is Faith expressed
[57:06] just like last night sneaking when you
[57:08] get the book
[57:09] you're going to see maybe a little
[57:10] confusion that I don't want to say it
[57:12] the two books of life it's the same book
[57:15] but one of them is your natural birth
[57:17] the other one is your spiritual book one
[57:19] leads out through the other one
[57:22] Now record that in your mind
[57:25] one of them is your natural birth
[57:29] it's in the Bible
[57:33] all right the other one is your
[57:34] spiritual birth
[57:37] now you remember let me say this word to
[57:39] clear up that part you remember brother
[57:41] Branham said arm and Neville's not
[57:43] written in the book
[57:47] but said what happened when Arman
[57:49] Neville was here
[57:51] is written in the book
[57:53] he said thereby that puts arm and
[57:55] Neville in the book
[57:57] now do you need that quote
[58:00] the Army Neville is not written in the
[58:02] Bible
[58:04] all right
[58:05] all right then what is it
[58:08] it's the writing in the Bible now that's
[58:10] both two good things one of them is the
[58:13] natural things that would tell us a day
[58:15] and the hour that Arma Neville would be
[58:17] living which would be of the world and
[58:19] the events of the world and what would
[58:21] be taking place but the other one is
[58:24] talking about him in a spiritual extent
[58:27] right I'm coming into the message I or
[58:30] believing the prophet walking there in
[58:33] all right so then it's right
[58:35] don't hold that point now just just keep
[58:38] on what we're going now and look at the
[58:40] next one
[58:41] if you're reading that way then we'll do
[58:43] it this is invisible Union paragraph 308
[58:47] there is your name on The Book of Life
[58:50] The Book of Life is a word of God
[58:52] no the word is God and God is the only
[58:55] thing that is life
[58:57] so your name was represented in the
[58:59] Bible before the Bible became on Word
[59:03] and if you're here to do that won't it
[59:05] vindicate that word
[59:07] your name was written in the Bible
[59:11] it's not written in there
[59:13] Richard Addison Samuel Gale
[59:19] Armand Neville
[59:22] is written in the Bible what will take
[59:24] place and the hour that we're living
[59:27] we're living where that the Bible said
[59:29] when the towers fall that's right right
[59:34] see that couldn't be written before that
[59:37] could be speaking of no other age
[59:39] but this age
[59:41] they had the Richard Nixon and the
[59:44] things you know and the Watergate
[59:47] when you go back in the Bible and find
[59:49] the word Watergate
[59:51] and you'll find that they found some
[59:54] scriptures and things that they hadn't
[59:56] read
[59:57] and they stood before the Watergate
[1:00:01] that was no accident
[1:00:04] that's the day we're living right right
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:08] if we could find it and really know what
[1:00:11] it is we'd know exactly the day and the
[1:00:13] hour
[1:00:16] but God's withholds those things from us
[1:00:18] but look at the things of what it's
[1:00:21] showing
[1:00:22] me
[1:00:24] two books he says
[1:00:26] right when the church age book came out
[1:00:28] we're going to read that in a minute
[1:00:31] I gave you the pages to read and ask you
[1:00:34] to read them on that
[1:00:36] it's about 262 to 280 in the church age
[1:00:38] book
[1:00:42] with the Bible is the book
[1:00:46] that you're talking about
[1:00:49] as I said then the Bible is living
[1:00:51] people
[1:00:53] so it won't have to be books
[1:00:57] but see what I want the title or what
[1:01:00] you're talking about the books we read
[1:01:02] in Revelation and we're written Daniel
[1:01:04] 2. the books were opened right
[1:01:11] and in Revelation you'll find that if
[1:01:13] your name was not written
[1:01:18] in the lounge Book of Life
[1:01:21] you got a problem
[1:01:24] you see it's written in the natural
[1:01:25] writing of the book
[1:01:27] I mean
[1:01:30] see then what is it
[1:01:34] with the next one on communion
[1:01:41] communion 1965 1212 paragraph 44.
[1:01:45] live in the book here in the spot there
[1:01:49] we was talking about the the two books
[1:01:52] being one
[1:01:53] The Book of Life
[1:01:55] the First Book of Life coming up was
[1:01:57] when you were born that was your natural
[1:01:59] birth but then one time way back down in
[1:02:03] there there was a little grain of wheat
[1:02:05] grain of life as I was explaining to
[1:02:07] some of the young sisters this afternoon
[1:02:09] then he goes into explaining what the
[1:02:13] book Lamb's Book of Life
[1:02:16] it's not on downstairs they're saying
[1:02:18] that's what he's explaining he's
[1:02:19] explaining two books but it's not two
[1:02:21] books all right nobody understands not
[1:02:24] two books it's one book
[1:02:27] but it's two sections or many sections
[1:02:30] of one book
[1:02:31] but they're open
[1:02:41] now there was years and that's when I
[1:02:43] held off from saying back there
[1:02:46] and I just speak you know I just had
[1:02:48] enough time to cover that service about
[1:02:50] the writing of the Bible
[1:02:55] but now
[1:02:58] in this day
[1:03:01] we're not interested in the writing of
[1:03:03] the Bible
[1:03:08] didn't quite like that
[1:03:11] means you're asleep are you thinking
[1:03:15] just getting chicken house when there's
[1:03:16] real sick you know you can always tell
[1:03:18] you just go
[1:03:19] whistle just a little
[1:03:21] all the chicken and get real quiet
[1:03:23] get that stick in here
[1:03:26] so you knew the chickens were sick so if
[1:03:29] I hear you snow or no no you're not I'm
[1:03:32] not listening all right
[1:03:35] what
[1:03:35] are you thinking
[1:03:38] we're not in the days of the writing
[1:03:41] we're in the days of the open book amen
[1:03:46] our part has been written that's right
[1:03:48] right
[1:03:52] it's been written about us yes
[1:03:55] you read East Church age right right
[1:03:59] and you write that there's good things
[1:04:02] and there's bad things
[1:04:04] right
[1:04:05] the lady will see you you're right it's
[1:04:07] good
[1:04:09] then you write a lot of bad you know
[1:04:10] it's written
[1:04:12] all right it's there about us
[1:04:15] but we're not in the days of the writing
[1:04:17] of the Bible right
[1:04:19] now here's brother Brown let's put him
[1:04:21] in there
[1:04:24] he said they could write another book of
[1:04:25] Acts behind this group of people
[1:04:30] right
[1:04:32] he said that this won't be nobody there
[1:04:34] to read it
[1:04:36] no
[1:04:38] come on
[1:04:39] do we're not in the days of the writing
[1:04:42] of the book
[1:04:43] amen now if you understand that I'll
[1:04:45] repeat it again so if anybody will tell
[1:04:47] you don't understand my language in ways
[1:04:49] it tells in the Bible or the beginning
[1:04:52] and the end of mankind
[1:04:54] so it's written in there
[1:04:56] but I'm not concerned about what the
[1:04:58] world is of today
[1:05:01] that's what you hear preachers they
[1:05:03] preach about all of these things
[1:05:04] Illuminati's I mean it was called
[1:05:06] Illuminati was super rich now it's all
[1:05:09] of these other things and you hear
[1:05:10] sermons after sermons about the these
[1:05:13] things what good is that going to do is
[1:05:15] that going to put us in the rapture
[1:05:18] now I want to hear about Jesus Christ
[1:05:20] well what do you mean when I preach
[1:05:22] Jesus
[1:05:26] you better back up
[1:05:30] because you just exposed yourself
[1:05:33] to think that you preached Jesus
[1:05:36] you think you've exalted
[1:05:39] the revelation of Jesus
[1:05:42] that's where you get enough trouble with
[1:05:43] it
[1:05:45] but listen
[1:05:46] we're in a day of the open book
[1:05:49] because that's also written in the Bible
[1:05:53] we're not going to the white Throne now
[1:05:57] we're going to sit with him on the
[1:05:58] throne as my red Daniel because it said
[1:06:00] be thousands of thousands sitting on the
[1:06:03] throne you know and then there'll be a
[1:06:05] thousand times thousand there what it
[1:06:06] was would be standing before
[1:06:10] it's told about where we're going to be
[1:06:12] we're going to sit on the throne with
[1:06:14] him judging others
[1:06:16] so don't this get even tied up in your
[1:06:18] mind of what I'm saying get what I'm
[1:06:21] trying to say
[1:06:24] you you always I used to when I was in
[1:06:27] school I I love to read but I didn't
[1:06:30] have enough time because we had
[1:06:31] everything else to do
[1:06:33] you know we was working we were flat on
[1:06:35] you and I wasn't seven years old from
[1:06:36] sun up to sundown so we didn't have time
[1:06:39] to let school to do a lot of work
[1:06:41] so what I would do is I'd just take the
[1:06:43] little introduction in the inside and I
[1:06:46] turn over to the back to make sure and I
[1:06:47] got all the names running correctly or
[1:06:49] something and you know and I just write
[1:06:51] my own story
[1:06:53] and I guess the school teacher knew that
[1:06:55] and she said well he's using his brain
[1:06:56] more than he would if he'd read the book
[1:06:58] you know
[1:07:00] because see I wasn't interested in what
[1:07:02] was in between
[1:07:04] I was interested in the last page
[1:07:08] well you know what I love about the
[1:07:09] Bible is the last page
[1:07:12] we're in a time of the opening of that
[1:07:13] book that has been written
[1:07:17] so we come to find out it's not a book
[1:07:18] it's not something like this
[1:07:21] it's people it's right right even though
[1:07:24] it may be a Judas a pharaoh or a Hitler
[1:07:27] or a Mussolini or whatever you know
[1:07:33] this is just a Earthly record that's
[1:07:35] right I'm not talking about opening this
[1:07:37] book at the white throne
[1:07:39] the judge out of it
[1:07:42] I'm talking about the ones that sitting
[1:07:44] on the throne right
[1:07:49] would it be something to where that you
[1:07:51] could you could kind of argue
[1:07:53] you know about
[1:07:55] get you a good lawyer in your defense
[1:07:59] but then
[1:08:01] you found you guilty of killing somebody
[1:08:03] well then you go up there and you start
[1:08:05] to start saying something you look up
[1:08:06] and dirty things
[1:08:08] and not much argument
[1:08:10] going to be at the white Throne judgment
[1:08:11] that's right because you're going to see
[1:08:14] those you sinned against
[1:08:18] well because they're the book that I'm
[1:08:19] talking about
[1:08:21] they are the book
[1:08:23] you know you following me
[1:08:26] they're in the book but it doesn't give
[1:08:28] me eternal life just causing sound
[1:08:30] even Jesus said to Judas during Luke
[1:08:33] said
[1:08:35] go Rejoice at the demons and things like
[1:08:37] that it's something to you he said
[1:08:39] Rejoice that your name is written in
[1:08:40] heaven
[1:08:41] and Judas was there
[1:08:44] we get time we'll get back to that in a
[1:08:46] minute
[1:08:48] judas's name was written there
[1:08:51] but I want to get this point to you
[1:08:55] we're in the days of the open book right
[1:09:00] see everybody coming along you know and
[1:09:03] they're being a message about three
[1:09:04] months and they read about they read a
[1:09:06] little bit in the seal book and you know
[1:09:08] and this that and the other and they say
[1:09:09] boy sets them seals broke the Bible
[1:09:12] become a brand new book
[1:09:16] man he read the silver all the way
[1:09:18] through
[1:09:21] and yet they know all about a brand new
[1:09:23] book
[1:09:25] right
[1:09:27] we used to be in a certain Church
[1:09:30] brother Thomas can probably remember who
[1:09:32] it was but
[1:09:34] you've been in the message a little
[1:09:35] while like me and he'd hurt a few tapes
[1:09:38] and he heard brother random say I take
[1:09:40] every spirit in here under my control
[1:09:45] my brother get up to church you don't
[1:09:47] need to see
[1:09:48] I take every spirit in here under my
[1:09:50] control and I thought landlord
[1:09:55] around was standing in place when he
[1:09:57] said today it wasn't just words out of
[1:10:00] his mouth
[1:10:02] he had control of what was in the
[1:10:04] building you know he had that part all
[1:10:06] right
[1:10:08] but now listen
[1:10:11] we're in the days of the open book
[1:10:14] I thought we believed
[1:10:16] that this end time message
[1:10:18] was the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:10:23] is that not true amen this message is
[1:10:27] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:10:29] well we're not in the days with the
[1:10:31] writing of the book
[1:10:34] we're the days of the open book
[1:10:38] and by being an open book now listen
[1:10:44] I hope you follow me
[1:10:48] Martin Luther could read this book and
[1:10:50] have a great understanding
[1:10:52] you preach a lot of things
[1:10:56] but do you think that Martin Luther
[1:10:58] understood
[1:11:01] that he was the very messenger the Bible
[1:11:04] spoken of
[1:11:09] do you think he turned the world upside
[1:11:11] down
[1:11:14] by preaching it
[1:11:16] but what if a man could have realized
[1:11:19] he was the one that was spoken of in the
[1:11:21] field
[1:11:23] Church age
[1:11:29] come on you following me
[1:11:33] see it was never until now
[1:11:35] that we could talk about an open book
[1:11:41] it's never until the end time you could
[1:11:43] talk about a book being opened
[1:11:48] when that Prophet preached those seals
[1:11:52] now listen what I'm saying
[1:11:55] he said the book became a brand new book
[1:11:58] you know that he never preached anything
[1:12:00] after then that he didn't relate back to
[1:12:03] the seals
[1:12:05] he said marriage and divorce was
[1:12:06] revealed to see them
[1:12:09] he said serpent city was revealed and
[1:12:11] see that's 58 when he preached it
[1:12:16] see nothing wasn't added
[1:12:21] it has to come a time to you and I that
[1:12:23] you can't anything else be added
[1:12:28] because the book now is open
[1:12:35] I swear that I don't have anything to
[1:12:37] hide
[1:12:38] I want to live an open book
[1:12:42] I want you to speak me
[1:12:46] and be open before you
[1:12:50] well because we're in the time of the
[1:12:52] open book
[1:12:54] because it's what it said in Daniel's in
[1:12:55] Revelations he said and the books were
[1:12:57] opened
[1:13:02] see the only way you can find your name
[1:13:04] written in the last book of life
[1:13:08] is for that book to be open to where you
[1:13:10] can read it
[1:13:15] God knows I'm just trying to make
[1:13:17] illustrations right all right
[1:13:19] do you think they understood about their
[1:13:21] names being written in the Lamb's Book
[1:13:23] of Life
[1:13:25] you think they understood about an
[1:13:27] eternal section of the book
[1:13:30] you think anybody down through time
[1:13:32] really understood those things until the
[1:13:34] prophet came
[1:13:37] see now it's an open book
[1:13:42] when the seals open to me they're in
[1:13:45] 1979 they began to open it run on into
[1:13:48] room it took on into
[1:13:50] 1981 and 82.
[1:13:55] then was when the Bible become a brand
[1:13:57] new book to me
[1:14:01] it didn't become a new book you didn't
[1:14:03] hear me say s it's a new book in 68 69
[1:14:07] 70.
[1:14:09] no
[1:14:13] just when God broke the seals to me I
[1:14:15] began to see
[1:14:18] then the Bible become a brand new book
[1:14:20] you know what it became an open book
[1:14:29] an open book
[1:14:32] remember I said John saw his name
[1:14:36] now what did they say John
[1:14:40] did he see even his life upon Earth
[1:14:49] remember in the lounge Book of Life we
[1:14:51] covered it back there that it's not
[1:14:54] Samuel Dale that's written in the Lamb's
[1:14:56] Book of Life
[1:14:57] you know the Eternal section remember
[1:15:01] it's my real name
[1:15:04] before I got here
[1:15:07] I can find Samuel in the Bible but that
[1:15:10] don't make me there
[1:15:15] but when I see through an open book
[1:15:19] and I find the day that I'm living
[1:15:21] and I see the hour that we're living
[1:15:24] right
[1:15:26] my name in the book the set of an arm
[1:15:29] and Neville
[1:15:31] what's going on in his day naturally we
[1:15:33] see
[1:15:35] all around the world we see what's going
[1:15:37] on
[1:15:38] right
[1:15:41] we can study about The Towers falling
[1:15:45] and we can say look at the Irish run in
[1:15:47] there
[1:15:48] but how much more do you hear about what
[1:15:50] happened read that word says about the
[1:15:53] time we're falling
[1:15:56] he said in that day
[1:15:59] the light off the sun would be seven
[1:16:03] times
[1:16:05] brighter
[1:16:07] and said the light of the Moon would be
[1:16:09] as the light of the Sun
[1:16:13] now that's talking about the bride of
[1:16:15] Christ in Jesus Christ Living in her
[1:16:17] right
[1:16:19] you don't hear that talked about you
[1:16:21] hear it talked about Powers falling or
[1:16:23] something well we're here
[1:16:25] look what the prophet said they
[1:16:27] Commander all over here
[1:16:30] look at all around the world let's take
[1:16:32] a play boy here
[1:16:33] no is the book open to you
[1:16:40] is this Bible become an open book
[1:16:43] yeah
[1:16:47] brother Reid when he saw what I had in
[1:16:49] mind he wanted my book
[1:16:54] because anywhere the prophet explains
[1:16:56] something
[1:16:57] and I can find I write it in there right
[1:17:00] at that scripture
[1:17:02] and then you questioned me about
[1:17:03] something I can just say look
[1:17:07] they all used to like about it because I
[1:17:10] gave my old Bible to Josh
[1:17:13] and uh
[1:17:14] we get Bible studying
[1:17:18] and they just asked a question about
[1:17:19] something and and they'd say well Josh
[1:17:22] you can't read it because you've got the
[1:17:23] cheater book
[1:17:25] he had the book that had the answers
[1:17:28] written on the side of the page
[1:17:30] we don't want to believe this message
[1:17:33] I'd like to know what runaround said
[1:17:35] about the scriptures right all right you
[1:17:38] shall ain't writing in my Bible it's too
[1:17:40] holy well that's all right it's your
[1:17:43] Bible so you do what you won't do this
[1:17:45] is mine all right all right
[1:17:47] see if I want to know something about
[1:17:49] something I just turned in there and see
[1:17:52] but you don't run around and explain
[1:17:53] that
[1:17:57] page 243 to see a book he talked about
[1:17:59] David dancing before the Lord
[1:18:03] you know I like that
[1:18:05] because the book's open to me you know I
[1:18:08] can't read them until I open the pages
[1:18:13] if this message has not opened the Bible
[1:18:16] where are we going that's right
[1:18:19] who are we going to follow what is the
[1:18:21] to follow all right
[1:18:23] this message has given us the answer to
[1:18:26] all things all right this message is the
[1:18:28] open book amen
[1:18:33] it explains everything
[1:18:41] see then what are we doing
[1:18:45] natural life is written in the book
[1:18:53] spiritual life is written in the book
[1:18:57] now how many will you agree on this
[1:18:59] statement
[1:19:00] we had to realize we're Sinners for it
[1:19:02] could be saved you agree amen right now
[1:19:06] what brought our attention that we were
[1:19:08] sinners
[1:19:13] come on
[1:19:18] is it not that we either read in the
[1:19:20] book
[1:19:21] you know the Bible
[1:19:22] or somebody preached it to him right
[1:19:25] right
[1:19:27] most of the time it's because somebody
[1:19:28] preached it to us right it's very rare
[1:19:30] that we read in the book ourselves now
[1:19:32] that we're a sinner we found out by
[1:19:33] somebody preached it we found out by
[1:19:35] somebody that was actually part of the
[1:19:38] book
[1:19:41] right
[1:19:45] but you see the Books open now
[1:19:51] that was what I was going to preach this
[1:19:52] morning and Lord James at about eight
[1:19:54] o'clock this morning
[1:19:56] give me what I brought so I hope you
[1:19:58] believe it was him but
[1:20:01] you know
[1:20:05] but we're in the days of the open book
[1:20:07] that's right
[1:20:09] anything you need to know that brought
[1:20:11] around and said is in the message
[1:20:14] or else we don't need to know it is that
[1:20:17] wrong enough
[1:20:19] what we don't what we need to know
[1:20:21] brother random told us what we don't
[1:20:23] need to know
[1:20:26] that's right
[1:20:28] he said these things in her eyes I
[1:20:30] wonder about
[1:20:32] will it be children born in the
[1:20:34] millennium
[1:20:44] but what about it
[1:20:46] is the book open to you
[1:20:51] now here's what most people do with
[1:20:52] opening a book
[1:20:54] okay I hope you got this on the video
[1:20:57] this is what most people do with the
[1:20:59] opening of the book
[1:21:02] out goes the book
[1:21:06] right
[1:21:07] now they got their own ideas
[1:21:10] they're writing the book
[1:21:12] now that's not according to the book
[1:21:16] right
[1:21:17] right anything we bring better be coming
[1:21:20] out of here right if it's not coming out
[1:21:23] of here how do you know whether it's
[1:21:24] right or not right
[1:21:27] who are you following me yeah amen the
[1:21:29] books were opened
[1:21:33] we now can go to the Bible and find our
[1:21:36] natural lives and find their history
[1:21:38] find the days we're living we can find
[1:21:41] The Towers falling we can find the
[1:21:43] things that are taking place
[1:21:45] we can find
[1:21:48] all the things the Bible spoke of that's
[1:21:51] right
[1:21:53] but can we find ourselves
[1:22:00] see that was the writing of the Bible
[1:22:02] and I didn't get to
[1:22:05] this now open
[1:22:07] the book is opened
[1:22:09] waiting on somebody
[1:22:13] to find her name in it come on
[1:22:16] and find the truth of it
[1:22:19] all right
[1:22:21] see let's go on a little bit
[1:22:25] you know in the Bible
[1:22:28] we like to read
[1:22:32] we talk about David given the bear
[1:22:34] a lion and a giant
[1:22:39] we enjoy that don't
[1:22:44] but how about it when it says that he
[1:22:48] took
[1:22:52] Bathsheba from Uriah
[1:22:56] we don't want to talk about that
[1:23:00] but you know that's in the book
[1:23:03] what about Abraham and believe in God we
[1:23:06] love to talk about that in this journey
[1:23:08] but what about giving his wife a welcome
[1:23:10] you know a couple of times
[1:23:13] we don't want to talk about that
[1:23:20] you know that the Bible also says about
[1:23:22] David
[1:23:25] and all of his doing that he was the
[1:23:26] outcome of God's eye right
[1:23:31] and David even himself said blessed is
[1:23:33] the man
[1:23:35] and God will not repute sin
[1:23:37] there must have been more to it than
[1:23:40] just
[1:23:41] writing of letters on the page
[1:23:47] you remember when we were looking at it
[1:23:50] while ago I won't ask him to pull it
[1:23:51] back up because I told you to remind me
[1:23:53] write it in right around said one of
[1:23:56] them leads out to the other
[1:24:01] you remember that statement yes
[1:24:03] two books
[1:24:06] a book no only one book with two
[1:24:08] sections
[1:24:09] one leads out to the other one
[1:24:13] in other words one shows your natural
[1:24:15] Journey as it starts and it leads all
[1:24:18] the way unto the finish of the spiritual
[1:24:20] journey
[1:24:23] right right
[1:24:27] all right
[1:24:29] now if that be true then
[1:24:32] one part of the book will lead out to
[1:24:34] the other part of the book
[1:24:37] and in one part of the book we see what
[1:24:39] we do
[1:24:42] huh
[1:24:44] the other part of the book we see that
[1:24:47] our old record is destroyed
[1:24:51] both in the same book
[1:24:54] yeah
[1:24:57] but you see now listen to what I'm
[1:24:59] talking about
[1:25:01] you can open the pages and read about
[1:25:03] our lives and what we're you know the
[1:25:05] doings
[1:25:07] but if that book is not open you can't
[1:25:09] see your old life is destroyed
[1:25:15] come on you see what I'm talking about
[1:25:17] an open book yes we say what somebody
[1:25:19] else says
[1:25:23] we say the prophet said our old record
[1:25:26] is gone
[1:25:29] right right
[1:25:33] that's wonderful if it's true that's
[1:25:36] right
[1:25:38] and it is for somebody right
[1:25:42] but what about me and you right
[1:25:47] if the book's not open you can't see
[1:25:49] it's your records destroyed
[1:25:54] you're just saying what somebody else
[1:25:56] saying somebody I've seen it see
[1:25:57] somebody says your record's destroyed
[1:25:59] and you're just saying what they say no
[1:26:01] man can call Jesus the Christ come on he
[1:26:03] accepted me by the Holy Ghost the
[1:26:05] prophet said you can stop for drunk
[1:26:06] going down the street and he'll say
[1:26:08] Jesus is a Christ he said that don't
[1:26:10] mean he knows what he's talking about
[1:26:17] the book is open you know that Jesus is
[1:26:20] the Christ amen
[1:26:23] are you listening
[1:26:24] when the book is opened
[1:26:27] you realize there is just one true and
[1:26:29] living God
[1:26:31] when the book is open you realize
[1:26:34] all the great things that are revealed
[1:26:36] are in
[1:26:38] you see yourself
[1:26:41] when the book opens it's when you see
[1:26:43] yourself that's true
[1:26:46] now let me quote again what wrote around
[1:26:48] he said John must have seen his name
[1:26:50] written now listen
[1:26:52] see if it's not close to the same
[1:26:54] paragraph
[1:26:55] he said when the seal broke to him
[1:26:59] yes when the seal broke to John he saw
[1:27:02] his name written
[1:27:04] you wouldn't rotten John out there you
[1:27:06] don't see that's right
[1:27:09] he's always said
[1:27:11] when the seals break to you you see who
[1:27:13] you are
[1:27:16] and I said break not to read it not to
[1:27:19] quote what somebody else says right
[1:27:24] I read from and you know what I've done
[1:27:26] and I've told you about it reading six
[1:27:28] books a day and two tapes one to work
[1:27:31] one back and read all of that at home
[1:27:33] all day at work
[1:27:37] but you know in 1979
[1:27:42] I couldn't understand how that profit
[1:27:44] what it would be and I could tell you
[1:27:47] almost all that he said in the seal book
[1:27:50] because I've read it so many times
[1:27:53] I was working a job that it took two
[1:27:55] people to run the day I was out
[1:27:57] it was so fast
[1:28:03] and the Lord spoke to me
[1:28:07] it always been concerned how did that
[1:28:09] Prophet know that that white horse rider
[1:28:12] was the Holy Ghost
[1:28:14] when he taught all of his life up until
[1:28:17] the time
[1:28:19] that it was the I mean it was the
[1:28:21] Antichrist that what how he was the
[1:28:23] answer when he taught all the way up to
[1:28:24] his life that it was the Holy Ghost
[1:28:27] what happened to the man
[1:28:30] what happened to brother Brown
[1:28:32] well they ain't gonna stole him
[1:28:35] glad you said that
[1:28:39] brother Randall said the angel tell him
[1:28:42] something he said he spent the rest of
[1:28:43] the day checking it out in the Bible go
[1:28:48] read the rest of the message
[1:28:51] did he take what the angel said he wrote
[1:28:53] down
[1:28:56] he went home and studied it
[1:28:59] in the Bible
[1:29:03] I always wondered you know how in the
[1:29:05] world was it just the words of an Angel
[1:29:08] run around and tell me that
[1:29:11] it was just a words of an angel that
[1:29:14] you're taking we're built on the work of
[1:29:16] an Angel
[1:29:17] what if that angel was the deceiving
[1:29:19] angel
[1:29:21] no no brother damn you brother well
[1:29:23] let's go on forget it
[1:29:25] Duo none went too far
[1:29:30] you see I questioned well how did that
[1:29:32] Prophet know
[1:29:36] and there while I was running that job
[1:29:39] just like that
[1:29:43] said the way he knew
[1:29:45] was because there's just one God right
[1:29:50] he said here stands one with a lamb with
[1:29:53] a book in his hand and dark goals the
[1:29:56] white horse rider
[1:29:59] he said thereby
[1:30:01] that's got to be the Antichrist even
[1:30:03] though he had taught it as being Jesus
[1:30:05] Christ he's seen it couldn't be why
[1:30:08] because you got two people in the Bible
[1:30:10] one of them's got to be the devil
[1:30:12] there's no such thing as two people in
[1:30:13] God right that's why I fight all these
[1:30:15] two Lords and River Jordans and all
[1:30:17] those doctrines you try to take it out
[1:30:21] of your mind in some way because the two
[1:30:23] people in the Bible one of them's the
[1:30:24] devil because God can't be two people
[1:30:26] right he's just one well now that's just
[1:30:29] the way you sit man ain't where I see it
[1:30:32] it's what the Bible says amen all right
[1:30:35] man so I said okay
[1:30:38] I wrote it down
[1:30:41] on a sheet of paper the old manifest
[1:30:43] things that we used to follow
[1:30:46] I wrote down here stand to the Lamb with
[1:30:48] a book in his name there goes a white
[1:30:49] horse rider so thereby's got to be the
[1:30:51] Antichrist
[1:30:52] I came home
[1:30:54] and I got my Superbook
[1:30:57] and I turned where that page was of
[1:31:00] course I could quote it in memory then
[1:31:04] because that's what I was standing there
[1:31:06] doing the rest of the day
[1:31:08] I said Lord thank you I know what it is
[1:31:10] because in the rest of the day them
[1:31:12] Wheels was turning I could quote 10
[1:31:13] pages I could talk to you
[1:31:17] and in my mind it was saying look at
[1:31:20] that other fella going out look at that
[1:31:22] other guy go read you see a book now in
[1:31:24] firstly about 1 58. in read a while
[1:31:27] we'll see it around it says that other
[1:31:29] fella riding all that other guy
[1:31:33] there's two guys one of them's the devil
[1:31:38] we'll see then I Knew by revelation
[1:31:41] how that first seal was broke
[1:31:44] because that's what broke it to me
[1:31:46] was a revelation
[1:31:48] then the Bible became a brand new book
[1:31:53] you've run around come along and he make
[1:31:55] a statement he said one seal will tie
[1:31:58] the entire Bible together
[1:32:06] God showed me that
[1:32:09] you can take one seal and tie the Bible
[1:32:11] together from Genesis to Revelation if
[1:32:13] it don't you Prophet was wrong
[1:32:16] see it become an open book
[1:32:19] has it become an open book to you or is
[1:32:21] that just a quote from Brother Dale come
[1:32:24] on I got enough sense to realize that
[1:32:26] right A lot of people say look look at
[1:32:29] that there's a white horse rider and
[1:32:30] there goes the other guy that could be a
[1:32:32] quote from Brother Dale
[1:32:35] come on just exactly like no man can
[1:32:38] call Jesus of Christ accepted me by the
[1:32:39] Holy Ghost you're saying what somebody
[1:32:41] else says has it been revealed to you
[1:32:43] about one God what do you think I
[1:32:45] preached so much about one God
[1:32:51] you take right around this message and
[1:32:53] it's magic confusing
[1:32:55] until the Holy Spirit reveals
[1:32:58] but once it's revealed it could be say
[1:33:00] no said no other way
[1:33:02] than the way he said it that's right
[1:33:05] come on
[1:33:08] let's get down to one more than you said
[1:33:11] I love this one
[1:33:13] I'm about to touch that part of it
[1:33:19] get over to number seven brother
[1:33:22] which is paragraph 223 invisible Union
[1:33:26] 65 11 25. should be number seven
[1:33:32] let me double check at the back here
[1:33:34] on my notes
[1:33:42] go find it to me
[1:33:46] now your old book is gone with your old
[1:33:49] union now your name and your old in your
[1:33:51] has been deal that's why I want to
[1:33:53] transfer
[1:33:57] you know you've been transferred
[1:34:03] now what does the word transferred mean
[1:34:05] or transfer
[1:34:09] to go from one place to another
[1:34:12] take this book and transfer it the Bible
[1:34:15] to from this corner to that corner I
[1:34:18] just transferred it right
[1:34:20] now what is brother I'm talking about
[1:34:25] I can take that right there and prove
[1:34:27] that he's false prophet
[1:34:30] and I'm standing here and say he knows
[1:34:32] exactly what he's talking about he
[1:34:33] wouldn't fall
[1:34:37] he said well how can you talked about it
[1:34:39] being fought if it's transferred
[1:34:43] how many times did your Prophet say
[1:34:46] they got a song now that says a new name
[1:34:49] was written in heaven and it's mine he
[1:34:53] said pretty good words but said bad
[1:34:55] revelation
[1:34:58] he said cause there ain't no such thing
[1:35:00] as a name being written in the Lamb's
[1:35:03] Book of Life now all right he said it
[1:35:05] was written before the world right or it
[1:35:08] was never written right amen
[1:35:14] now if transferred means it was taken
[1:35:17] from one and put in another
[1:35:22] did you add a name
[1:35:26] was it right a blank space over here
[1:35:30] and a name over here
[1:35:32] and you took it put it in that blank
[1:35:34] space
[1:35:37] did you take it from The Book of Life
[1:35:40] and put it in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:35:47] come on
[1:35:50] then it wasn't there to start with
[1:35:52] that's right
[1:35:56] you see that's why I love to preach
[1:35:59] we didn't meet one time and I asked a
[1:36:01] question this man got it behind me
[1:36:03] because nobody couldn't answer the
[1:36:04] question I'm honest it happened
[1:36:05] nothing's exalting me I just asked a
[1:36:07] question they didn't know the answer
[1:36:09] now I got it behind me he said I hate it
[1:36:11] when a man asked a question he's the
[1:36:13] only one in the building got to answer
[1:36:14] it
[1:36:15] I said I wouldn't ask a question if I
[1:36:17] hadn't had the answer
[1:36:20] I wasn't making sarcastic and I'm not
[1:36:22] making sarcastic now I'm just telling it
[1:36:24] like it is
[1:36:25] I like to preach when you can put it up
[1:36:27] on the board in front of people say your
[1:36:29] Prophet said your name was transferred
[1:36:32] now what does he mean
[1:36:36] because according to our terminologies
[1:36:39] it means taking it from one place and
[1:36:41] putting it in another one right right
[1:36:43] which means it's in this place but not
[1:36:45] in this place oh my right
[1:36:50] come on am I right
[1:36:53] see I believe you're prophet he knows
[1:36:55] exactly what he's talking about
[1:36:56] that's right amen and what else could he
[1:36:59] say to hide it from the wise and prove
[1:37:01] it
[1:37:02] amen he said Your name's been
[1:37:05] transferred
[1:37:07] yeah you know that hit it
[1:37:10] from the theologians
[1:37:12] from everybody
[1:37:15] except those who God reveals it to
[1:37:22] him so you see it it's not transferring
[1:37:25] like
[1:37:26] because your name is here
[1:37:28] and you move it over here
[1:37:34] that's not what it is
[1:37:37] it's when the book opens
[1:37:42] now we're getting they want to go
[1:37:44] when the book opens
[1:37:47] you can know then that your old book is
[1:37:50] gone
[1:37:52] it is in the sea of his forgetfulness so
[1:37:55] then transferred is not taking it out of
[1:37:58] the old book
[1:38:02] and rewriting it in the new
[1:38:05] that's not what he's talking about study
[1:38:07] the message
[1:38:08] he's talking about the Plan of
[1:38:09] Redemption
[1:38:11] so what is it then
[1:38:14] it's the Revelation amen
[1:38:19] that your name is no longer in the old
[1:38:21] book
[1:38:23] and it has been cleaned
[1:38:25] and gone with your old Union
[1:38:29] and now you see it
[1:38:31] in the lounge book life
[1:38:34] right
[1:38:36] not transferred like our word
[1:38:38] transferred
[1:38:42] not to take it out put it over here but
[1:38:45] when we find out
[1:38:47] mine open books that's it
[1:38:50] that our old life is gone that's right
[1:38:53] then we can look over into the book of
[1:38:56] life and see there it is
[1:38:58] it was written there before the
[1:39:00] foundation of the world you wouldn't
[1:39:02] transferred over there
[1:39:04] God revised rely on a prophet to say it
[1:39:06] where it would hide it right
[1:39:08] go study the message he's talking about
[1:39:11] doing away with your own life your whole
[1:39:13] Union you were married to Adam right
[1:39:17] no Union
[1:39:21] and then
[1:39:25] you found out where your name was really
[1:39:26] at right
[1:39:28] when the seal broke John saw his name
[1:39:34] nurse when the Bible becomes a new book
[1:39:36] when the seals break off of it
[1:39:40] not when you read to see a book right
[1:39:43] I'm trying to tell you that I tried to
[1:39:45] illustrate it I probably read that seal
[1:39:47] book between the time of 66 that I heard
[1:39:50] of the message and began to read until
[1:39:53] 79 I I don't tell him how many times I
[1:39:56] had read that chill book
[1:40:01] but then one day the prophet opened it
[1:40:04] you say the prophet
[1:40:06] his words did right right
[1:40:09] because it cannot be said any other way
[1:40:12] his words opened it
[1:40:15] his words opened the invisible Union of
[1:40:18] the bride of Christ that I could see my
[1:40:20] name
[1:40:22] written in the lounge book of life
[1:40:25] eternal section
[1:40:27] and I knew then it had to be somewhere
[1:40:29] brought to that place
[1:40:31] now let's take one second
[1:40:34] when I came to Earth
[1:40:37] I was dealing in the old book
[1:40:40] would you right all right the books
[1:40:47] would you know that brother Randall say
[1:40:49] that your name even goes on the book as
[1:40:50] a Believer it's sanctification
[1:40:53] you need those quotes
[1:40:57] he said well wait a minute he said
[1:40:59] judas's name was written in heaven
[1:41:02] if you read that church age book of
[1:41:04] where I gave it to you you'll hear all
[1:41:05] of this
[1:41:13] then what happened
[1:41:15] is there a blank space on the Lamb's
[1:41:18] Book of Life and then your name was
[1:41:19] written there no
[1:41:22] it's rotten apart to run around the set
[1:41:24] of a religious order
[1:41:26] do I say
[1:41:28] he said Judas was a part of it
[1:41:31] he said all the foolish virgins and
[1:41:33] things were the part of a religious
[1:41:35] order and he said your name goes on the
[1:41:37] book as a Believer under the religious
[1:41:39] order
[1:41:40] he's not talking about the lamb Book of
[1:41:42] Life he's either put on there before the
[1:41:43] foundational world I never will be put
[1:41:45] down right
[1:41:46] he's talking about a religious order of
[1:41:48] a book
[1:41:51] right
[1:41:53] your name goes on at sanctification yes
[1:41:58] oh that's what happened to Judas
[1:42:01] he said oh no I don't know what's your
[1:42:04] Prophet to you
[1:42:07] you see it was always on the lounge Book
[1:42:09] of Life
[1:42:10] but what you got to do to clean up all
[1:42:12] the old record before you can realize
[1:42:13] and the book's kind of open that's right
[1:42:18] the book's got to open to you to realize
[1:42:20] your life is gone
[1:42:24] and once it opens
[1:42:27] and you can see that old self is gone
[1:42:30] that's right
[1:42:31] now you will never come until you're
[1:42:35] changed to see all gone away from you
[1:42:40] so don't even record that in your brain
[1:42:43] I'm not talking about we're going to
[1:42:45] become goody goodies no we're going to
[1:42:48] be batty Baddies
[1:42:50] the prophet said you'd be a sticker
[1:42:51] until the change came that's right
[1:42:53] that's right because I'm not talking to
[1:42:54] something I'm talking about a revelation
[1:43:01] that's where
[1:43:03] people go out and they try to show
[1:43:05] people of the world and the first thing
[1:43:07] they want to show them is marriage and
[1:43:08] divorce to try to win them into this
[1:43:10] message
[1:43:11] and that's something
[1:43:13] you can't do that
[1:43:15] put them on one God put him in the
[1:43:18] church let them start reading on one God
[1:43:22] didn't begin to realize yes but stand
[1:43:24] together
[1:43:28] think about it 561 Redbook 961 of the
[1:43:32] red book
[1:43:33] 61 61 in the red book
[1:43:36] think on these things
[1:43:41] have you seen that your name is not in
[1:43:48] the old records
[1:43:50] you're born again
[1:43:52] the soul of that individual is not on
[1:43:54] any record
[1:43:56] is pure
[1:43:59] it's become an open book
[1:44:01] the revelation of this message has
[1:44:03] brought us to the place of an open book
[1:44:09] but if we're still living like the devil
[1:44:11] under the old nature
[1:44:13] blaming our name
[1:44:15] we are deceived
[1:44:20] right
[1:44:22] now we're human I just got to say that
[1:44:24] we're human we're subject to human times
[1:44:27] we're subject to life and Humanity
[1:44:31] but I mean yielding ourselves to those
[1:44:33] things and become a garbage can
[1:44:37] then the book's not open
[1:44:43] an open book
[1:44:46] to where I can read it
[1:44:49] I don't have to listen to what somebody
[1:44:51] else says about it
[1:44:52] I can read from Sam
[1:44:55] does that do away with teachers in the
[1:44:57] body and all that puts them in the right
[1:44:58] place because thank God for the
[1:45:00] thoughtful and Ministry to bring us the
[1:45:03] word
[1:45:05] let's say this is
[1:45:16] dare not trust the sweetest friend
[1:45:24] how we feel on Earth
[1:45:35] the record
[1:45:38] when we see our old life destroying new
[1:45:41] eyes
[1:45:45] is
[1:45:47] she exactly what
[1:45:50] happened what's not your name not Samuel
[1:45:53] Dale he said it's the name
[1:46:08] gonna say my name is transferred
[1:46:14] I look
[1:46:17] I look again
[1:46:20] it is there on the left
[1:46:30] that's our lives under Samuel Dale is
[1:46:32] gone
[1:46:37] that's what Britain is
[1:46:48] this alone
[1:47:04] age

[1:48:43] a whole lot of company
[1:48:47] about a lord have to bring this out

[1:51:27] Goliath West
[1:51:30] and I'm
[1:51:31] I know that's kind of small
[1:51:33] the minute he looked back up he said if
[1:51:36] he hadn't got that other one
