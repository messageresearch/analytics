TRANSCRIPT
========================================
be seated right God bless you all this morning amen if the brothers can go to get that pulled up and we'll start with a word of Prayer precious Lord Jesus we thank you Father just for this this privilege once again Lord to stand before you people of Lord for this just short Sunday school Lord we pray you bless every heart this morning certainly speak to our hearts Lord Jesus and Lord I pray you just um meet every need Lord bless your people this morning Lord help me and just guide me Lord to get what you'd have me to get across Lord I pray we commit the rest of the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord amen so Financial Jubilee Port part five we're on our way and um amen hopefully you're making progress by the grace of the Lord Jesus and the thought this morning just fighting to believe you know and this has been just on my heart you know fighting to believe Brotherton go to the next one and um Every Time I Think of financial Jubilee and the word Jubilee it says um the Year of Jubilee that when all slaves and prisoners as they were been taken and they were in bondage no matter how long they've been in bondage or long or how long they were supposed to stay there when the year come of Jubilee when the trumpet sounded every man could go free if he wanted to go free amen and certainly that Jubilee has sounded that trumpet I think the word of God we know that word of God is that Jubilee and that has sounded long time ago long time ago you know this word of course has been around for we know uh centuries you know way before our birth God sent a prophet before my birth so that Jubilee trumpet has sounded and of course when we talk about financial Jubilee to me it's just a little model it's like a map that we can all use but again we want to apply that to all areas of our life but it's just a little map that you can bring up and kind of say okay what am I doing in this area you know and then again apply that spiritually so everything we talk about can be applied spiritually and again we got the word we got this trumpet I mean in the bible you know it's so many things on finances that's been there and like I said you know when I lost all that money years ago trying to do business trying to do all this stuff and I was like I said I was paying my tithes and I started saying Lord God what's going on what is happening I think I'm doing everything right and I just didn't know within that word it was so much that was there before I was born and guess what that word was there before anyone was born in this room so it's been here so the question we got to say you know if if we got this trumpet that sounded and we can go free and again again apply this spiritually as well we got these promises all these things that are here we got a prophet that has come and gone why is it a challenge for us to go free why is it a challenge for us our families our children to be free let's say financially and then think spiritually as well but why so I you know the question would be why is it hard to go free why would a slave if a jubilee trumpet sound they would be difficult for them to go free well if I would ask okay if we were in slavery let's say for example and we said okay the trumpet saying you can go free but why is there a if if well a couple things will come to mind and say well obviously we could be too comfortable like hey you know what mass is doing a pretty good job taking care of me you know MasterCard let's throw that out there doing a pretty good job taking care of me you know what I mean I it does good when I need something it gives me something you know what I'm saying so you got that it's too comfortable I don't want to go out there on my own and really work for it and really save and do all those things it's just so easy to go in and get what provision they're giving me could be too hard because it's too much or you could also just not believe that you're free you know I just it's just too difficult so some of that come to it you get scared you know you and you really come down to it as I said fighting to believe sometimes you just don't want to fight too comfortable and you just don't want to fight for it you don't want to fight we don't want to fight for these promises and fight for this word fight to be financially free again these promises all these things have been here before my birth but they're there so you know when I look at all these deep things that we talk about you know and as I said before is this you know money to me is a shallow shallow area of course it's shallow but it can get very deep but you know we have a lot of shallow water problems you know in our families you know in our situations you know and even in the Deep even if you go into the deep you know this came in my heart this morning our Prophet you know he went into the deep and he was in the deep but he had to come back down and sell his boat through those shallow Waters dealing with his kids for example Billy Paul smoking cigarettes I mean he had to come right down his son running out there and getting married and all these things that he had to deal with his daughter up there playing rock and roll music his wife having a hard time with Joseph at home you know and she slams the door you know and he said I can handle that ain't no problem to me God said no no you need to go take care of some things so it's like he was deep but he had to go right back and sail through those things and come back out and then come back out and see demons and all kinds of things deep Waters so my so if he had to go through that and we are facing things like that then we have to know how to navigate in these shallow Waters and not get stuck go to the next slide he says now you take on a stream like the stream of life and plenty of Driftwood hanging up in every trash pile and yet the boat comes along made out of wood too but if you notice the wood is made and shaped out by a master who has built the boat not only is it shaped out but it is Guided by the master and is pushed by a power and if this certain little craft that's been made different and been crafted out by the Master's Hand should ever get ever stick in some weeds along and shallow Waters there is a power behind it a little bolt that the master can turn on and push us out into the deep Waters again amen so I just saw that you know that shallow Waters and I think that's what happens in our journey you know we get stuck in these weeds along in Shallow waters you know and those things impact Our Lives as I said last time knowing you know song service and thinking about my parents and you know we were raised in a Christian home and hey we didn't have a TV we had devotions we had Bible time you know know we had that at night our family had a lot of potential let me tell you we had a lot of potential but it still did not go according to plan you know my mom and dad as you know they ended up getting separated and divorced and a lot of things and all of us kids just went it happened you know and I look at that and I said my goodness what happened and I applied it to my own life and that's why Financial Jubilee means so much to me because I said wow I I didn't know some things and then I figured out some things by the grace of God in his word marriage is in this Bible all these things are there to help us in these shallow Waters so we don't get stuck but there's something that we're missing and I believe that falls to fighting to believe and I think you'll see that as we we go through this go to the next slide and that's the way it is with human life you can't play the rules of the game of Life wrong and expect to win you gotta play according to God's word and the purpose that you were brought here for man that alone says a whole lot you know you can't play this game in your marriage in your home in your finances and everything and certainly not in these deep promises that we have how we're going to win you we can't win if we don't play according to the rules and certainly The Game of Life is a wonderful game I love playing it you know and every time we bring it out I gotta get the rules out and decide okay how much money they get you know um and they have some choices you know we got to make first when you first start off with like do you go to college or do you go and get a job and start and that's how the Game of Life played and then along the road you pick up kids and all kind of things and that certainly is what happened we got a marriage today a wonderful couple that's starting out that Journey you know and um but the only way they're going to win they got to play according to the rules and the only way we're going to win you know and I figured out I said my goodness you know when is my marriage at a point that is sealed I realize until I get out of here it's a lifetime Journey I'm not gonna take it for granted you know and I know until we get out of here we're on that Journey so I don't take my wife for granted I'm always working and trying my best to get better to learn to grow to fight for it to fight for it you know and I certainly I look at my parents and those some of the things that they they didn't know how to fight the rules were there they were there they had plans they had Playbook and that's why we have to stay in the word every day read your Bible pray stay in it apply it to the areas of your life that you're going through you know if you need certain vegetables certain vitamins you take those certain things in the same way you know if you've got financial problems you got money problems you got marriage problems you got word problem you got understanding problems hey look for that vitamin that word and apply it to your life amen so certainly and now there are so many people that doesn't seem to have any kind of purpose in life especially in this day that we now and people just seem to think that they can all they have to do is keep up with someone else with the Fashions of this world with the enticements of this world that the world has given to them and oh my the devil he has that laid out for us for sure you know just all we can just keep up with the next person even in the church anywhere we sometimes set our Target just for that person well I'm doing a little bit better than them you know I got some money in the bank and I got some debt so I think I'm all right I'm better than that person who only has debt you know I'm doing pretty good you know we tell ourselves that you know and all these influences and things like that that there to to trap us to pull us you know I mean you can't even talk nowadays without thinking about the the impact of social media on us and our children our families it's just really devastating but all it does is set that Mark to okay if I could just keep up with someone else if I'm doing a little bit better than them a little bit more exciting than them then I'm doing all right that's not the marker it's the rule book this is what we have to do we got to play it according to this so we're going to run real quick through some of the principles again that's in this Playbook that's in this plan that's been here go to the next slide so some of the principles that's in the word God owns it all remember that it's all his so he's given you what he wants to give you he can give you more if you want to and give you less if he wants to he's given you all that he wants to give you 10 is his and a 90 it's his he just wants to see how you're going to manage that you got to be diligent that's period it's not your resources is his now diligent you've got to be organized and that's in the way you can be organized write things down write it down on a napkin a plate whatever you do whatever you have to do it just write some things down get a little bit organized if you got debt lists those things from the smallest to the largest just list them put something on your fridge okay I got to take care of this try just keep moving in that direction the Bible says the hand of the diligent shall bear rule the hand of the diligent if we're going to rule in these great things and have speaking power and all this stuff that we're promised man we got to be able to rule a dollar we have to be able to rule that thing by the grace of God money is your time you purchase stuff with your time learning to wait again that's very important we'll spend a little time on that as well learning to wait that is uh more than important especially for our younger generation it's extremely strange extremely difficult difficult for us older ones as well but certainly for the younger generation it is it is detrimental it's just um the devil knows what to do to make it almost impossible to to wait the next principle number five avoid debt remember the blessings of the Lord that maketh the rich he had is no sorrow to it you remember in the word of God God promised the the Israelites he said hey blessings and curse if you obey God's word he said look you won't be borrowing from anybody that's what he told them naturally that's what he told him he said you're going to be the one lending you won't need to borrow from these Heathen Nations around you that's what he told him is it different for us is it well that's the question it can seem challenging it can seem like well maybe that is a little different for us but is it very important but we know God discourages debt we know that's in the word save a little you're going to get older just apply these things directly to my life my father's 84 years old he was the hardest working man I knew in my life my dad never slept in ever I never see my dad sleeping four o'clock five o'clock he was up out the door gone to work every single day but he didn't know how to save you know he told me early on when he started finding out that I could save he knew about some of my money problems and a little bit after that I started saving he said my John you know I had a cousin that could save I didn't know how to save wow dad man I didn't know that either but I see the impact it had on his life you know he's not that young man anymore so it's a lot of struggles a lot of challenges when if he could have put a little bit away when he was younger he would have reached this stage a little bit different so save a little bit the best principle giving we know that given to the kingdom of God managing your resources to a point that you can give it's more blessed to give than receive and learning to be content we talked about that last time as well contentment next quote this very every time I talk about financial Jubilee this just pops in my heart it just is just a challenge to all of us again we got the word we got the prophet now notice what he said this is 1965. many of you probably were younger some of you weren't born but he's saying this clean your lives up pay your debts oh no man Jesus said get all things off your hands get everything right Make Ready Get Ready remember in the name of the Lord something is fixing to happen my my this was 1965. so many of you again were younger I was born after this time but this has been here our Prophet that God sent to us said get everything right clean up your lives make ready are we ready you know so we asked the question why is our lives not cleaned up to that point is everything right well by God's grace we're striving we're striving No Doubt but certainly take that to heart and remember that our Prophet had brought that to us and now we can take that and apply that he's telling you pay your debts off oh no man get all these things off of your hand Make Ready Get Ready so we got all these precious promises but we have to be ready by the grace of almighty God now we're going to see what what what is going on you know why just think about money why is it so hard to say I have good conversations at home of course with younger kids and an adult child coming along and the whole mind they know so much now with the internet they can Google you know what I mean like hey is it a way you can do this or that and this and Daddy's old school trying to bring it slow and it's like man dead you know but if you do this daddy you can do that and we just have these good conversations at the point I'm like all right you're an adult child [Laughter] let's watch and then that is really key you know and sometimes us parents were trying to say these things but I was talking to her brother in the parking lot the other day you know I said hey John it's it's not me it's not daddy's opinion it's God's word it is not what I'm saying man if I'm I'm like you John I would be doing this or that too but God's word The Playbook The Playbook so we look at Israel we look at them and what our prophecy said God gave them go to the next slide Brothers he said um now remember God gave them the land down in Egypt said the land is yours every bit of it now the people today are expecting now watch that word expecting God to reach down get them by the neck and say yes that's right you bring me out clean me up heal me and I'll believe you God doesn't do his business that way he gives you the promise but you have got to fight for every inch of ground that you possess period that is set in the tone that's why fighting to believe he's telling you hey God give you all these promises oh debt Freedom Financial Jubilee precious promises all these great promises but he's saying God don't run his business that way he's not going to just hand it to you you're gonna have to fight for it our kids are going to have to fight you're going to have to fight you're going to have to be prayerful in fighting this thing through you're gonna have to fight for your marriage you're gonna have to fight for your finances you're gonna have to fight for this word you're gonna have to fight for these precious promises but we got to believe because he already said it's ours he said it as we know II Peter which we know here by the grace of God we many times we're born whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises I put that exactly what brother Brenham said he gives a promise but you have got to fight for it amen that we can be partakers of the divine nature have an escape the corruption that is in the world through lust so we see right there we got to fight I wish it was not that but it is that that means it's not coming to us easy my brothers and sisters none of this but we got the promise we can start there Lord you got the promise so Lord I'm gonna take that and that's where I'm going to start I can have a blessed home I can have a blessed marriage I can be financially free I can take on these promises and have enough character to possess them by the grace of the Lord Jesus go to the next slide so I want to just kind of look back a little bit on Joshua and Caleb versus the 10 spies because they were given these promises of that promised land okay and we see we got two sides we got two people that's standing up you know one person is saying hey as Caleb Still the people and said let us go now we can go this is ours we can possess it it's what we are well able to overcome so I can stand here financially free and say hey we are well able to take Financial Jubilee same thing applied to the promises we're well able we're more than able it's not even a question of whether we're able or not we're more than able but the next verse but but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we yeah they're like no it's impossible you know when I stood there and I'm taken into context everything we talk about you know we think well those ten no we are in ourselves all of that within our soul we get we're born again we have the Joshua and Caleb the Holy Spirit there but in that Spirit brim see taste feel smelling here that's those 10 spies that come right back along you started saving but it's not this is too hard I ain't gonna never reach it I can't do it you know what I mean them Giants too big if I want that car for 30 000 I just it's just that's how our kids feel I know I talked to my son he believe me you feel like it no that's a big giant dad um it's impossible no it's not no it's not impossible by the grace of God and that's anything and all these promises that we have here as well it's not impossible for us to possess all of these characteristics all of these virtues about the grace of the Lord amen but we have to be willing to to fight through that and you know during that fight it was something I mean those 10 spies they got the people all messed up is the Bible says they cried all night The People cried all night like uh what are they talking about it's impossible uh you know got to the point that they wanted to Stone Joshua and Caleb so you think about the Battle we can have in our own selves your soul and that Spirit realm telling you you can't that Soul saying you can do this we can't overcome that Spirit man like no is impossible and that can put you where you're crying all night crying all night over the problems the issues and the things that we're facing as if we don't have precious promises my my mind go to the next so we're going to spend a little time with Joshua because I think this kind of sets the tone of these promises that we have financially spiritually in every Factor God promised them he said every place that the soul of your foot will thread will tread I have given it to you as I said to Moses no man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life as I was with Moses so I will be with you I will not leave you nor forsake you my mama and do we believe we have those same promises amen go to the next now this way it starts changing it up on a little bit now that's like me inviting you to my house and like I got so many things for y'all y'all come over I got whoa y'all gonna be so excited I'm Gonna Give You Things Are Gonna Change Your Life and you're like oh yes okay man when I'm when I'm gonna come I'm gonna come to this weekend I'm gonna be there and then I start saying but be strong and you'll be like well and make sure you have some good courage well next week not gonna work brother John um yeah so you see he started to say yeah you got all these promises but um all of a sudden now yeah you got this inheritance of the land and I swear to your fathers to give you and here he goes again yeah come on over only be strong and very courageous she's like John what what you giving me brother I thought it was a gift you know that ain't that sounded very worrisome that I may be able to do all according to the law which Moses my servant gave commanded you that's okay that's okay come on in sorry it's all right do not turn from the right hand or to the left hand that you may Prosper whether you go now he's setting some some plan go to the next slide and we'll try to wrap up or wrap it up pretty close the book of the law shall not depart from your mouth but you shall meditate it day and night that you may observe to do according to all that's written in for then will you make your way prosperous have I not I commanded you be strong and of good courage look how you're just putting that in do not be afraid do norbitus made Mama those are some strong words that word dismayed I looked that up and it just means my don't be shocked things are not going to work out the way you expect don't be shocked and stunned and Frozen and like oh what happened Oh my he said don't be dismayed because that's what's going to be on the journey you're going to run into some obstacles they're going to be some things that will shock you and make you say well my are these promises really true is it really true so those are the things we got to watch out not to be dismayed and we can be in dismayed for a long period of time believe me not knowing why is this not working out the way I thought maybe it's not true uh all these things and that happens to us so don't be dismayed go to the next so key as we're wrapping up it's fight fight fight brothers and sisters that's what it is it's fight fight fight but Josh Moses and Joshua the Israelite had to fight for every inch of ground they got and every promise in the book is yours but God will never give it to you and you lay back on your bed of ease you'll fight for every inch you get that's it fight for every inch my look at this quote he lays out things is handed to you that's what the matter with the American people tonight you got everything handed to you well fed fattened clothed and everything else so I know the devil's job boy if he can get us to a point where we don't know how to fight we don't want to fight then he'll do that he'll set that in you can't hold on so we're not seeing God work in these shallow areas of our life to get enough training inspiration experience to look at these big things and say Yes Lord I can conquer them so that fighting my brothers and sisters is so strategic it's so God is prayerful it's everything that we know but you gotta fight it's not going to be handed to us it's not but I know for sure you know if we can stand by the grace of God and just practice that's why I think Jubilee is just Financial Jubilee it's just an area to practice it's little weights that you can just practice hold out if you don't have the money hold out hold out a little bit ask God to help me Lord this is what I desire you promise to give me my desires Lord but I don't want my master to have it give it to me Lord God if I have to maybe you know not eat those extra cheeseburgers or get you know small size fries this time you know what I mean or get this smaller Meal instead of spend ten dollars I'm gonna spend five dollars or because I'm working on this plan and watch God come in and start working as you're working you get experience from that like wow he did Supply he did Supply so then when we hit these harder promises these higher things we can say yes God I remember you did this for me didn't David do that he said but bear you know a lion Lord I so who is Goliath who is Goliath Lord if I wanted something great Lord I believe you can supply my need but you know if I need that so I'm going to you first Lord is that something for me or do you want that not to be for me because you will give me the desires of my heart if I'm delighting your word so I'm leave you with these couple tips on fighting just in that same scripture and then we'll call it the musicians can get ready to come up so fighting this is what he laid out be strong and of good courage now courage oh my good courage you did probably didn't pause the thing why did he say good courage because there's bad courage you can be courageous like you know what I am going to go talk to that loan officer I'm gonna do it I'm courageous I'm good that is bad courage that's not good courage you know or you got this young man that he's like you know what I'm you know that girl I know I shouldn't be talking to her she's you know decked out this way she's not a Christian but ah she's on my level I'ma do it that's you think that's bad courage good courage is waiting on God waiting on God to give you that be strong and of good courage be strong and very courageous it's not coming to us easy Brothers and Sisters You've got to be very courageous observe and believe and to do what his Prophet had told us observe pay attention believe it and do all that is in that scripture do not turn to the left or to the right play according to the rules play according to the rules stay in the word meditate it day and night you gotta know to play book amen again in areas of course we got the whole word but if you're going through something specific find everything around that find that thing pay attention meditate on it day and night observe believe and do what is in the word be strong and of good courage again that's in that chapter on down it's listed again it's yours you got it it's a gift but you're gonna have to be strong and have good courage come on in and do not be afraid do not be afraid so that's part of the journey you're going to be afraid that's why we wouldn't go free if the trumpet was sounded do not be dismayed don't lose your courage or believe don't be shocked don't be shaken up by a situation or An Occurrence by the grace of the Lord that's your fighting roles and in the book that's always been here God bless you all and I pray God bless you and be with you [Applause]
