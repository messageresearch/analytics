Description:
1) «  15-3       †        THE.REVELATION.OF.JESUS.CHRIST  -  CHURCH.AGE.BOOK  CPT.1
Now remember this. Christ in the True Church is a continuation of the Book of Acts. But the Book of Revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it, making it lukewarm, formal and powerless. It exposes Satan, revealing his works (attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word) right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire. He fights that. He cannot stand it. He knows that if the people get the TRUE REVELATION of the TRUE CHURCH and what she is, what she stands for and that SHE CAN DO THE GREATER WORKS, she will be an invincible army. If they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church, and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit, Satan will be powerless before her. He will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over Him in the desert. Yes, Satan hates revelation. But we love it. With true revelation in our lives, the gates of hell cannot prevail against us, but we will prevail over them.

«  36       †          You know, somewhere in there, as I was reading, I... If you'll excuse me a minute, I--I found some place that sounded good to me, and I don't know just where it was at now. Here it is.
... and knowest thou not... wretched,... miserable,... poor,... blind,... naked:
37    Oh, my, that's kind of the picture here of the church of today! Now, it's, I--I think that that church age here, that we're speaking of... Course, I've got the church age coming forth now in the books. But being that is the Laodicean Church Age that we're in, let's just look at the conditions.
38    I don't want to take any text or anything, because we're not... just talking casually, as we see to talk on whatever the Lord would lead us to do, but somethin...

everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn what we've been reading in Revelations three and then we will go to Hebrews 11 uh remember now the bible study this will be the first Saturday in September 6:00 keep that in mind remember the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday in September which it is at brother lorus so just remember that and anyone want to ride with us make sure you let us know ahead of time where we can can do it amen and uh I know you already announced it but I called to check on sister longor and they said she was having good days and bad days so keep praying for her that the Lord would would be with her all right uh let's see we have brother Joe has made or will make some copies of the testimony that I mentioned uh Wednesday night about the little boy that uh fell off the tractor and got ran over and the Lord healed him and little fell said you know that that the Lord healed him for the world so you know you can get a copy of that it's also got a copy and some of you remember it a sister or young girl and brother Tim puit Church years ago that she her hire all came out the Lord healed her and it all came back so if you want the testimonies of it um you know let let brother Joe know and he can make copies of them all right trying to get that out of the way we also have uh this little copy of a thing called if Jesus came to your house if you want a copy of it you can come up and get one today glad to have all of our company we call it that way because brother Daniel and his family and brother Timothy and him uh timbo they're they're not uh visitors but they're you here with us today glad to have them but we have a couple of back rows back there there's probably more visitors today than they are church people so there's a couple of back rows back there that are are uh I think they're kin folks to brother Louise maybe in some of the ways or sisters or something and one of them is brother Timothy Brett's son of course we'll pray for him the Lord will take care of that he's you know no he's nice looking fell but glad to have all of you with us as we always say here here if you're a visitor and you come one time you're just a visitor and we welcome you but then from then on you're just part of us because we don't have anything to join up with we're just part of the body of Jesus Christ so remember all of these um let's see I guess I've got it all the announcements Heavenly Father we thank you for this day in your grace and your love Lord unto us thank you for all things that you've given unto us and Lord we ask ask you to just bless us now with your presence come Among Us in a mighty way Lord and just fill our hearts with love and understanding and may we walk in your grace and Lord just cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to see ourselves in the mirror of your word that we may walk therein and Lord bless and guide each one bless the visitors and the company Lords coming and just have your way with each one in our hearts and lives remember the sick among us and thank thank you for all things we love you in Jesus name amen Revelations 3 14 we've been on this one for quite a while and unto the angel of the Church of the lady of candr these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness and who is he the beginning of the creation of God and what did the prophet say about us we are the continuation of of that creation all right now then let's go over to Hebrews and we'll pick up our parts here to do today and we'll if we have a chance this afternoon we'll try to have the questions and answers according to how we move in the amount that we have today all right and let's go to about verse 32 now you can read the whole these are all Warriors of faith and all up until until until you get down to about the uh maybe the 35th verse all of this can be pertaining to the Old Testament Saints but if you'll look when you get about verse 35 it begins to pick up that would probably be into more or less down to the ages the Dark Ages and the times and the troubles and all uh because the whole thing then finishes in verse 2 verse 40 all right so remember that these are all the Warriors of faith and what shall I say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Baro and of Samson and jeath and of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Violet in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance they may that they might obtain a better Resurrection see now you're coming down in through the Dark Ages and and getting into the New Testament right and others had trial of cruel Mo Kings and scoring yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sown aunder were tempted were slain with a sword they wanted to about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wondered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all have obtained a good report through faith now once received not the promise yeah right then he concludes it by saying God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now they re the Old Testament Saints they said down through the the time and and all those Old Testament Saints had passed on and went into uh you know paradise and a place with a for their holding and see they was not made perfect all right then the ones down to the church ages because we'll cover both of them the Lord willing today to showing it that down to the church ages you've had the bride all the way down that she's had to go by the grave so she never came to Perfection Now That Word Perfect there is the same in Matthew 5 5:48 is that right where that it speaks of be there perfect it doesn't mean sinless life on Amen it doesn't even refer that in Matthew you it it's referring to a completion amen the word perfect is com is there and you translate it to completion all right so those Old Testament Saints never reached completion right all right they had to die and go by the grave all right and they're waiting the resurrection and they're not complete right all right that's right then your new testament Saints coming down see then they had to die and go by the grave and people are still dying and going by the grave because it's not been brought to the point of completion yet all right so then he concludes it by saying one thing without us they're not made perfect now that would be pointing to the end time all right I'll get back to it in a minute in the message and bring it through but just remember the Old Testament saints were under the blood of bulls and goats all right they never attained to the blood of Jesus Christ okay now then in doing that then see Paul could say they without us because see he was in the atonement the New Testament brought the atonement the Old Testament look forward to the time of the coming of the atonement but never a chied that place all right so they were never brought to their completeness all right so then in the New Testament see then you would have the last group the end time people that would be fulfilled into that of saying that they without us cannot be made perfect all right see then that brings it all to a finished product yep okay it brings it to a place to where that we we can see uh you know uh the truth of all things because if there's not a resurrection a physical Resurrection yet then somebody's waiting on us and we're the last on so that's the one you're waiting on all right first to be Li Li to be first so then you know it's meant for this end time people to reach a position to bring the Dead from the ground all right so then we believe that that they would without us cannot be made perfect so everything has its placing did you follow the Old Testament Saints never received their completeness because they were only under the blood of wlls and goats but we're under the blood of Jesus Christ but we've never received a body change yet all right now the Bible says that that and I believe it's Timothy the word it says that speaking of Jesus Christ that he's the only one that has reached immortality right the light which no man can approach unto all right now I know there's an arguments in the message among the people but I ain't going to argue with nobody I'm just going to leave it alone let them argue their yourself away and we're going to try to make a change of the body because irregardless of what you're going to argue about who this is and what that is it's going to wind up to the point that you've got to have something to come to a bodily Resurrection amen amen all right that's right see then if a bodily Resurrection has already come to the Old Testament people then they went into immortality in the scripture would be incorrect that would say that nobody's reached immortality but Jesus Christ immortality is Mortal made Eternal right so then Jesus Christ is the only one to reach to that total position yet even though the Old Testament Saints some of them raised but you can argue about how they're raised that's up to you I ain't going to worry about it I'm just talking about the truth that they without us cannot be made perfect they're in the grave waiting on you and I right all right see then on that basis then as we covered Wednesday night we were talking about in the the message that God was waiting on you and I you remember we gave the quotes from the we'll revie a few of them but you know the whole service Wednesday night was the fact that God is waiting on you and I right you said God waiting on us well that's what your Prophet said so you talk to him about it you know in the Bible would tell you that so then what are they waiting on what was God waiting on somebody to take his word right right he's waiting for somebody to step out well brother brandom has amen amen we believe that that's right all right and he can represent the whole bride amen we believe that that's right but that's why are we here 50 years later on that's right that's all I've asked y right is just why are we here 50 years later you know all right you say yeah but this over here has got to happen that over there is I covered Wednesday night that over there can happen in a hurry and what we get our eyes set on looking at wondering if it can happened or has happened or what's going on then we can miss what's going on right cuz God wants somebody to believe him all right we were dealing with a couple of three or four messages on what that the prophet of God said God can't do anything until somebody believes it and confesses it now you you say well yeah God can do what he want to but he bound himself to his word right he said he wouldn't do nothing in on Amos 3 and 6 he said he wouldn't do nothing but he reveal his secrets to His prophets so there shouldn't be any worry about whether it's right or not of what we're saying amen God's waiting on you and I to confess it right how is salvation brought to pass how is healing brought toies according to Romans 10 what it says first Believe in Your Heart Right and confess with your mouth all right you do one of them without doing the other one you're not going to get salvation now what does confess mean it means to say the same thing all right see then if you can take the word of God upon your heart and believe it and confess it God can make it come to pass and he's waiting on somebody to do that so what do you say what is your confession you remember where we was reading those where brother R was saying Joshua what is your thought he said but what's your decision God's waiting on his bride to step up and believe the word of God Amen and confess it right well I believe it I believe it and I've confessed it yeah well how come God didn't save most of the people that done that now come on I'm not against the Baptist but we came through there bapst theology is what confess it and you're saved right I said they read that scripture there in Romans so much until I I didn't got where I didn't like it not not liking the scripture not liking the way mankind had Ed that scripture because you just come up to the altar you believe in your heart you confess with your mouth and you're saved right well now you got to admit one thing how come biggest the biggest portion of people who done that never got saved you don't think like that you don't remember where you came from and the churches and the ways you don't remember in this message and the things that you've seen people come up and make a conf passion and claiming to believe and get up and go right back and become worse than they were to start with do you remember that I mean you you think about it somebody around you you remember why didn't God save them if they done what he said so there must be something wrong with the believing and the confessing right amen so it's very important once you believe right right that's right and then it's necessary to confess that so if we're not believing what God says he doesn't have to honor it right but if we're believing what he says and confessing what he says which means to say the same thing he says that's right then he can come on the scene and save you right I'm just trying to make a point that's what I've tried to drive hard with us and we talk talk about salvation but see if you don't believe in your heart the Lord Jesus Christ has raised from the dead well I believe that but that's just saying what somebody else said amen that's right you're quoting what somebody else has said Until It's Made Real to you that's right then when it's made real to you you are believing it and confessing it that's right and there's salvation then if you stop confessing right right you go down the road a little while and you're doing pretty good but then all at once you start sliding and your confession is not the same as it was what happened right we read to you where the Prophet said you lose your confession and even Christians he said you remember that one that even Christians Born Again Believers will backslide right am oh brother Dale you believe in backsliding I believe you can backslide if you don't you argue with brother randam or the man in the Hebrew series went out and got drunk and God took him home and the prophet said God had to take his child home cuz he couldn't Mar his name see now that's up to you I'm just trying to make a point to to illustrate that God wants somebody to believe it and confess it am all right then he'll come and make it come to P but if our confession stops it must be something wrong right or are we like the Methodist now the Methodist believe that you're you're saved and lost you're saved and lost you you're saved and lost you just if you're doing pretty good you you're safe you're not you know that was their Doctrine but now we're are we good Baptist in that would say well I believe it and I've confessed it so I'm saved and like I've always said then if you notice then nobody going to hell no more they're going to have to do away with it because everybody's confessing it right Buddha Hindu Muslim whatever they want everybody in the same category right make a confession is all you got to do well there's truth to making a confession if you don't make it you can't be saved that's right but it's according to what you confess that's it right there right see then if your confession is what he says am he'll honor it but if it's not what he says he don't have to honor it right right right simple little Point see then what's God waiting on you and I to believe who we are and confess it right you and I as Born Again Believers Believers in the message following the message all of our life borned in the message whatever you know but he's still wanting us to believe it and confess it cuz if not why we've been here 50 years that's right since the going of the Prophet well we're waiting on you brother Dale well I don't think that's totally all of it I'm sure sure you have been but you know that's all right because you can do without me but you can't do without him all right so is that the way the prophet said it said he can do without us but said we can't do without him so we got to make sure our confession is correct that's right right are you afraid I've got a quote L here where brother around said are you afraid to confess it now you know the story you heard it where the lady said I I spoke in tongues got saved last night but said don't tell nobody well now what kind of a confession is that but look I just pulled this one all a while ago because I knew I'd be using it where brother BR says on the message Jehovah Gyra said he's making intercession Upon Our profession God can do nothing for you until first by faith you accept it and believe it and confess it right amen that's the way God can act now is when you act first that's right right when you act first okay why because he's the high priest making intercession on your confession of your faith in his finished work amen right making a confession Queen of Sheba he says and confess it for God can do nothing until first you confess it that's right the Bible in Hebrews three said he's the high priest of our confession he says now profess and confess is is the same word he can do nothing till first you confess that he's did it and accept it as your personal property now watch him you can't get saved by beating on the altar or can't get saved by paying your tithe or keeping some days or abstain from meats you don't get saved by that it's by faith are you saved and that through the grace of God you have to accept it first and believe it as your own personal property then you're saved amen then you're healed that's right right right he can't do anything until we confess it and so but you're limited God my God can do anything he wants to he cannot break his word if he has said it he has to keep it I didn't write the book right he's the one that said my sins is in the sea of forgetfulness if I'll believe it he wrote the book I didn't write the book see he can't do nothing until somebody says it that's right all right so then what has been the writing of the Bible as I've tried to cover right this is what somebody said right y that's right I gave it to you Wednesday night where the Prophet said what he said that it's laying on the pages of this book right and he said as long as it stays there it can be questioned right but he said when it's revealed to you it cannot be questioned that's right all right but see it's according to what we're confessing is according to what he's doing now if he is the high priest you know what a high priest does high priest makes an offering right an atonement you realize he can't make the atonement if I don't say it that's right now God will not override your free Mor agency and make you get saved don't ever think that amen see he's waiting on somebody to say it where he can come on the scene and make it manifest then we've got to confess the hour that we're living like I was illustrating see Martin Luther no telling how many times he had preached in and done great uh essays or what you call them written them about the just shall live by faith there was a lot of people already preaching a lot about the J shall live by faith before Martin Luther came along all right but see one day it came off the pages into a man's heart and he believed it and confessed it and the world was converted right amen right because he believed it and said it right how many other people was already saying those things read your history a little there were a lot of people protesting the Catholic Church before Martin Luther came on the scene that's right but they never was in the scriptural Point see when that scripture struck Martin Luther he looked down and I wrote it because it was on the thing they say he wrote down you know the CH shall live by faith alone right I wrote that in my Bible because I believe that too you see if it's not revealed to you that you just you live by faith you're not saved that's right amen and you oh no but I've done this I've done it if it's not revealed that's right right that was the new birth to Martin Luther amen and that was the new birth to the people of the age or the just you live by faith he wasn't crying and shouting and speaking in tongues and doing all those are are manifestations and thing which to first to believe in your heart and then confess with your mouth that's right what God says right but you know people don't want it that way they want some kind of an idea or a thought about what saved them I'm saved because you know that you say well I'm saved cuz I believe the message I gave you a quote Wednesday night where brother R he said I'm not saved because I bring this message that's right right oh he's not saved because he brings the message and you say I'm saved because I believe the message all right if you truly believe it that's right and if it's revealed you ain't got no problem right come on come on Church get right with it what about your sisters what about your hire your clothes your things you'll argue about it argue about it fuss about it gra about it complain about it try to find excuses well this you know but if it's ever revealed to you that's right right you won't cut your hair no more right you won't paint your fa if it's revealed to you right but until it is you'll go do it and try to justify is that simple right what a revelation takes away all things right that's right come on yeah but that ain't got nothing to do well it's in the word it's got something to do with it all right amen then see we studied as I said Wednesday night that God's waiting on you and I he's waiting on you and I to believe it and confess it amen then he can make it manifest Hallelujah right he can make it alive if we believe it that's right and say it but why wouldn't we want to say it are you afraid are you afraid to stand on God's word see why not stand on and say by Stripes I'm Healed you know God's waiting on you to say that where he can make it m you realize before the world ever begun he'd already by his do had healed you right but when it comes to you down here you got to say what he said back there that's right right you remember how I was bringing it out Wednesday night yes Abraham goes down to slaughter the Kings he ain't got no bible to read that's right he comes back from the slaughter of the Kings and he says Lord I'll give you 10% why didn't he say give him 50 or 60 or 90 or whatever I said I'll give you 10% where did you get that thought from where did Moses get the thought from to speak the word now I wasn't the one that wrote the book so you argue with brother Randon brother BR said as long as it's a thought until you speak it it's not the word right amen he said until you speak it it is not the word we say well this is the word all this is letters on a [Music] page and I just quoted you if you want that where brother R said as long as he's laying on these Pages it can be questioned but if it's revealed it can't be questioned you see each writer in this book God spoke to them and they wrote what God Said you ever looked up what is thus sayith the Lord you ever just thought about it do you realize that means God speaking through somebody right that's right thus sayth the Lord is God speaking to a prophet to go speak it right well we don't have the sayith the lord well that's where you missing it that's right this is thus sayith the Lord this is God's word amen this is thus sayith the Lord yeah but if we just had thus sayith the Lord by Stripes your heel that's what the Lord said right sir all right come on are you listening then yes this to get to a thought cuz you see you are what you confess that you are that's right right y right I've confessed all of my life I was a Dale whether they like me or not but see I've always said that because that's what I believe right if you think you don't believe in predestination you better think about it I'm the 13th child and my daddy was 63 years old when I was born my mother was 42 or three you don't believe in predestination you you're really missing it right right but listen church are you listening yes is there any problem to say you're a Christian well I'm a Christian but I I just don't want to I don't want to I I'm just this is the way we do well we're really good at justifying something I I'm I'm embarrassed yeah you ever heard people say that there I'm embarrassed to say things I remember a prophet standing before God Moses remember his story and you know we life about him doing that and talk about it but he said Lord I've got a speech impediment well why didn't he say take it away and I'll speak it no he wanted to keep his speech impediment cuz that justified the fact he wouldn't have to say it so what did God do he gave him Aaron right but we we say what what he he de well why don't you say you're a Christian then go out and live like it but do you live any different out there than you live here is your come on sisters is your clothes and you dress and your H different here than it is when you go to work tomorrow then there's something wrong with you okay listen you know know God what he's really wanting you and I to do is realize who we are amen now we know for a certainty the Bible says it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people as sheep of his pastor we know the scripture right you know he chose you you didn't choose him right all right we see all he wants you to do is say it he's wanting us to realize Who We Are now I was illustrating it a lot of people protested the Catholic church right they had all kind of uprisings before Martin Luther came on the scene but none of them could go in the Bible other than their own thoughts they probably taught a lot like we do oh that old Catholic Church that old that's old babblin over here that's all this over there that's this over here you know they had Scholars too back then you know but you know what God never done a thing with none of them that's right right but when one little old man said to Joshua live by faith Heaven stopped for a moment and says now we're on the way you realize it had never been a restoration of all things had Martin Luther not started out to J you live by faith that's why I still believe what he taught now not what he taught of the trinitarian doctrine and all of the things he awful no but I believe what he taught him to just you live by faith am come on brother R said Calvin was a rascal said he taught the truth you know he said he called him he said he was a rascal but said he taught some truth but see when are we going to realize who we are well I know who I am I'm in the message of the hour well what about it to realize Who We Are by faith or to realize Who We Are by reading in books now who was it Daniel realized by books that's right they say by books we see all right they were dependent on something there to happen but just realiz in by books that time was about over didn't do any much good you know what he had to do he had to go to a time that he was set free am then what the book says came into reality right well when are we going to realize who we are you know and God's waiting on you and I to do that yeah but I've been in the message brother Dale for 40 years I know who I am well praise the Lord when you going to start saying it when you're going to start believing it may I quote brother random that they're laying in here he said it's got further and further and further away y now that's his words further and further and further away about three or four furthers away what with people confessing him but what are they confessing no we're confessing we're sick we're confessing with this we're confessing with that we're not confessing what the word says right see he just wants somebody to confess it all right let's just take a little thought cuz I gave you these the other night and it's a good time to put them in right now so let's just see what God's waiting on go ahead with number one Brothers which is revelation of Jesus Christ page 15 roll it on up cuz we'll just be reading this point but he talks about the coming down the time to you know to be cast into the Lake of Fire talking about Satan he fights that he cannot stand it now watch what is it say can't stand that's right amen he knows that the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she stands for excuse me what she is and what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army what when she realizes and she gets a revelation of what she is and what she stands for and what she can do right if they get a true Revelation watch of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit now let's take a this little thought there what would be the two Spirits now we could break it down and make it an antichrist Doctrine and we can make it a way off this way and make but really in plain sense what is two Spirits could you put it in simple terminologies where the children can understand it what is the two Spirits oh one of them is the spirit of God the other one is the spirit of the devil well now uh that's all right CU that's it but why don't you think simple everybody says Brother D is so deep I'm so simple until it's amazing cuz I think in Simplicity you realize there's two spirits that I'm against you know what they are one Spirit among the people of this message is we've already got it we've got it we got it here it's our we got it we don't want to hear nothing else we got it what's the other Spirit we going to get it one of these days we're going to get it there's two simple points of two Spirits now you can tie it all together with the Antichrist movement because he's the one that causes that may I quote brother random man is always looking at what God [Music] done and what God will [Music] do and what did he say the big problem was not seeing what's going on now you know there's nowhere in the Bible that God is of the future right he speaks of it writes of it no but he's not in the future neither is God in the past when he met Moses at the burning bush when that statement was made he said I am that I am now interpret that as the prophet would bring it and even with your writers get in him that simply means when he says I am that I am now you remember the story right back behind behind there God appeared to Moses and said I'm the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob right read your Bible Moses said I know about that God of Abraham I know about the God of Isaac I know about the God of Jacob but said I ain't going to Egypt until you tell me your name read your Bible cuz they're going to want to know who sent me that's right and he said why do I tell them that's right he said tell them I am that I am Hallelujah Moses takes off to Egypt he's happy okay right why because God struck his heart I am means everpresent for eternity there's the words of the Prophet I am means ever presentent for eternity you realize the only thing you have in you that's Eternal is the word that's revealed to you amen I wish I had all of the knowledge that's in his head made known to me but that's why I'm not looking out you under and I'm not looking back there that's Faith Builder to talk about what's been that's Faith Builder right to talk about coming that's Faith to believe that God can do but we're right here today see that's what God's Wan somebody to do to realize where we at and what we're doing and what we stand for am look what he says about it he said Satan will be poweress before her he will be as definitely CED today as when he when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert now he says we will be an invincible arm he said we will be Satan will be definitely tarted brought down same as Jesus Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them that's right amen now when Jesus said that about Peter he said the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail and we know the organizational systems that have all come down through there Satan has prevailed right yes that's right but to the true bride he's not been able to Prevail amen that's right amen right that's right well because the true bride realized who they were right when they knew who they were they not to worry about it right and see those Old Testament Saints look what they were that's why Hebrews 11 is wonderful to read over over and over and over and over and over and over the Warriors of faith that had each one of them a personal true revelation of almighty God read every one of them and go back and read it in the Old Testament go back to Abraham go back to David go back to them y David said a lion I've killed a bar I've killed he said and Goliath you'll be just like them you know how brother around and put the emphasis on you ever listen to him I love the way he emphasizing he said now if God thought enough to let David kill a bar and a line just to take care of a few little old sheep right you need that I'll be glad to show it to you he said what about when you come up to face goli that he wasn't talking about sheeps and goats he's talking about the children of God and God's Almighty promise that's why David never worried about it I've told you over and over and over right what happened when David was anointed to be king he wasn't afraid of nothing cuz he knew one thing for certain until he sat on that Throne he didn't care how many Giants was there he didn't care how many lines was there he was not going to be destroyed till he set on that Throne could we believe it that way I thought we believed it look at the next one and knoweth it not reaching 1965 look what he says lead us to something Lord that'll help us let's think of the lady of seean church age and its condition as far as I know I don't see anything to hinder at this time the coming of the Lord Jesus now listen but now we've got it all set up the woman's got to be in the White House oh Russia's got to come out of oil we got to have this we got to have that now I didn't write the book that's right you argu the man that said it right he said I don't see anything to hinder at this time the coming of the Lord Jesus what outside of the Readiness of his church so who's God waiting on he's waiting on his church to stand up and believe it right mhm don't see nothing in it outside the Readiness of his church look I think that one of the the prophecies what's he saying all his whole message was prophecy that the church was going to stand in the end time and walk out on his word was that not his whole message how many prophecies do we need but God's waiting on you and I so we're still tied a little bit back to to that so let's get a few and then we'll try to pick up this evening and go on look at the next one as the eagle stirreth his nest look what he says you talking about civilization and all of the doings uh can't stand any longer she's just weaving and shaking What's it waiting for it's way past due right as it was in the days of Noah long suffering look it's lapped over time for the elect's sake we've been here 50 years for the elect sake right is that what he was saying there way P but God's waiting to get his church in order he's waiting on you and I may he Grant the blessing he's waiting on you and I waiting on us to believe who we are is that what it was right prior right that the one we was reading just prior to where he's waiting on you and I to realize who we are and what we're here for you see God don't need no help he just needs us to get out of the way but you know what I love about him listening to him the other night and I got it in the notes here somewhere Jesus was standing there and he said to the disciples now who was he almighty God right in human flesh he was the lord of the Harvest Right am I right now but yet he looked back at the disciples and said pray that the lord of the Harvest send forth laborers I mean he he's the lord of the Harvest and he's saying pray that I'll do what I said I'd do cuz he said he'd send forth the laborers but he said for you to pray you to say it you pray what did he need me and you for that's right he's the lord of the Harvest but he said pray that the lord of the Harvest will send forth laborers why because he give you something to do how many of you praying for God to hurry up and get this over with amen right you ain't old enough yet to the young ones you'll find out one of these days you'll get old enough to say Lord hurry up but that's because you're getting old right but think about it the lord of the Harvest God himself standing there says now you pray that I do what my word says I'm going to do so he wants you to pray did not John when he got over on patmas what did he come down with he said even though come Lord Jesus he'd seen all of the things and wrote about all of and he said even though come Lord Jesus yes right no we still hung up with them back I'm on that part while IO you know we're the one that's back here that says we got we do we are we still like we used to be you still you can get up in the church and say let's pray for the Lord to to hurry and hasten no don't pray to Hast today my kids ain't saved pray that the Lord don't come cuz my family ain't saved you remember that yes or was you asleep then like you sleep now while I'm trying to pre now come on if you ever we in any church you know what I'm talking about a truth they never prayed for God to come that's right they prayed for God to T where their family could get saved that's right well you don't want my family saved no but may I quote the prophet he said if you ain't got enough Faith that's right to believe for your family he said I doubt you got enough faith for your own self amen oh that changed it didn't it if you don't have enough faith for your family you don't in other words if you don't have enough Faith right now right you know right now to believe it well when my family comes in I believe it no no no you got to believe for them y right you got to believe it before it takes place and confess it before it takes place y I got in trouble years ago confessing that my son was coming back to the Lord you know why they say what do you think you are you think you're something great cuz you you can come no I done what the Bible said and I claimed Wade claimed him and sent the Lord after him the Lord showed me in the scripture says you'll be there with your Offspring let settled it right right even before he came back to the Lord as a sinner I told my wife and forbid her to say a word about it I said not only is he coming back to the Lord but he's going to be standing in the pull pit ministering with me I said' Lord's already showed me that the reason I didn't tou and announce that I didn't want him to know that and when he come back to the Lord I certainly didn't tell him and he comes to me one day and he says Daddy I want to talk to you I said you don't want to talk to me he said you know what I'm talking about I said I no go ask your mama I know what you're talking about but I ain't going to have nothing to do with it he said you mean you know that that I'm talking about that the Lord's called me to preach I said run run run run son until the Lord can run you down you said well you're crazy I know it but I believed it you know what he's here ministering so that solves that problem why don't you confess things that are impossible right amen but how many of you have got enough guts to stand up and say I claim my family amen amen I claim my children I claim my grandchildren great grandchildren I claim them why not believe it amen may I requote the prophet if you ain't got enough faith for them to be saved then you don't have no faith yourself amen right yeah but you just don't understand how bad my family is God's not in the business of being good to people and all he he he's kind of in the business of saving Sinners right okay I'm on the wrong thing listen waiting for the church to get into a place go ahead with number four which is the church choosing law for Grace we're in a terrible condition the church itself what did it do listen because we separated ourselves one separated to this one and one separated to that one we become great organizations what you got in the message now you in the two Soul you in the seventh univers you in the perua you and right right come on we become great organizational mind organization minded and everything just showing you exactly in type what what they did then and we would have went on over and been in the Millennium see you you get what he's saying right if we hadn't separated we'd have been in the Millennium you know what he's talking about the children of Israel for 40 years walking around and around out there in the wilderness right it was only a matter of a few days to walk straight into the promise and it was 40 years and we got 50 God give us 10 more I believe that the coming of Jesus Jesus Christ is p you now that's 19 and 61 I could prove it by the Bible the Bible said Jesus Christ said himself as it was in the days of Noah and God was longsuffering not willing that any should perish was longsuffering waiting waiting holding off the Wrath waiting see if somebody else would and waiting and waiting and waiting as it was was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man God's longsuffering waiting to get his church in condition right what is it what is it he said instead of getting in condition we're getting further away all the time uh that's where we we we get to battling right 30 40 years ago you would miss a service for nothing you quit your job 30 years ago before You' Miss Services right right now you miss for anything he brother Dale well well all right take that as a slam in your face thank you you got what I'm talking about you talking about me yeses that solve the problem right okay what are you going to argue about look we ought have been in the Millennium we ought to been doing something for God we already went in 40 years ago but no we've made the same mistake mistake they did they come to kades barnea 40 years and God turned them back because of their unbelief come to Katie Baria and they turn back in the wilderness because of their unbelief what is it what is getting the church into condition well if we could if we could just get this we could get that you just wait one of these days that woman going to get in the White House boy we going to that woman's been in the White House a long time and brother randam made this statement in 1966 it wasn't the year he made it the year I heard it either that or 67 he said wait until that Catholic Church worms it way in the White House well I had very few things to be able didn't have no computers and things to do with very few things that I could come up with to see who was Catholics and who wasn't and I got to checking on it and searching out everything I could and I come find out about 1967 there was 1,500 Catholics already in the white house now you tell me how many's in there now and brother randam was the one that said it I didn't he said a woman in the white he said are the Catholic Church you don't read them do you you always want the woman in the White House you know why because woman ain't in the wife we at least got 6 months right nobody wants to believe that the end is here wait a little longer please Jesus okay let me get a few more go back down North it not paragraph 283 which is number five and what are we coming here for what are we doing what are we coming what are we what are we doing are we coming here playing a game are we coming here meeting as a lodge are we coming here to play church can I put that in there it is speak right is that what he's talking about cuz remember he's talking to the church he ain't talking to the world he ain't talking about Lodge meetings and things right it's Christ can't come until that church is perfectly right he's waiting on us I believe we're at the end he's waiting on us amen God's waiting on us what kind of waiting is he doing number six pardon 1963 roll it on up you can read all of it it's placed on there for that purpose God is waiting the hour to see his church come to that position regardless of denomination regardless of creed color whatever it may be that's his entire church that his entire church would come to the place that they're displaying the token of the death of Jesus Christ am waiting on us to display you know what if that was 1963 and he's saying he's waiting on us to display it evidently the people wouldn't displaying it is that sensible look at the next one Paradox 1961 the only thing God's waiting on now I believe look Russia don't mean nothing to God you heard me Wednesday night some of you wouldn't hear what I was talking about you realize that in just a matter of hours that all these things can take place that's been spoke of by the prophet oh well ain't no war in the White House got to be 6 months you can have a coupe right now and she can take over that's right you don't believe that can happen in America that's where you're I'm trying to get away from saying stupid now I use the word idiots is that better on a bunch of people that don't believe things can happen one of your Presidents spoke of Marshall Law right and his big man with him said you can't do that them people got guns that was back in the 60s what you get what you you came to over in where was it the other day turkey or where it was that thing had been planned for months years almost for them to have that Coupe and it failed see all these things can be set up can happen in a moment Russia can drop a bomb down our Smoke Stack anytime they want to cuz we done give away everything we got in defense you know of our own defense so what is brother Brown saying Russia don't mean nothing to God he wants to get one man and listen at him he don't have to have big organizations he don't have to have big denominations he wants to get one man that he can wrap his Spirit into him that'll tell the rest of it there will be another Paradox and he until he can get someone completely surrendered that will do that that's the way God does his work he uses paradoxes that's right but but but but brother Dale brother brother brother Dale he he he's talking about himself okay I'll agree with you 50 years ago what's it done for you I'll agree he's talking about himself get one man I'll agree with you it was a man back there that with stood all of religious systems and things wasn't it but what good has that done you and me that's all right but what if God's waiting on one person now to stand up that's it what if he's waiting on you to do it what if he's waiting on you to stand up and say I see it and I confess it now let's put it back in your lap to where you can do it because every one of us is individuals in Jesus Christ right we are not a corporate group of people we are individuals God is waiting on individuals to stand up and believe who they are God is not waiting on a church as a group to stand up and believe who they are he's waiting on individuals to stand up Gentiles are individuals God never deals with the Gentiles as a corporate thing or a group of people right right right so everybody sitting here or to say that's me am that's me that's me am but are you afraid to say it what if everybody else misses it what if everybody else misses it it's left up to you right yeah but I believe it if brother so and so says it what if he don't never say it we done had one man stood up [Music] amen but we had a Martin Luther stood up and protested to Catholic church and wrote his thesis you know what they never got mad at him at all they could have killed the old boy anytime they wanted to they could have done anything they wanted to to him right but they wasn't afraid of him right but when the day came that the people stood up behind what he said the Gates of Hell started shaking brother brandham has done it and brought us the message he's been the David to kill the Goliath but you know what David probably went on vacation oh we see it in the movies he kept doing this that and the other come on get my point David probably went over and sat down and said get him boys and the rest of the people took care of the enemy they wasn't scared just called David killed Goliath that's one they had 100,000 or something back there they could have sent them every one out David you getting the point yes the children of Israel is what they run from because David he killed Goliath but then they rose up and took off straight toward the enemy right and they defeated the enemy amen David maybe never killed another man Arnold Von winkl Lord right everybody knows the story The Swiss Army was trapped and pinned down but he said this day I die for Switzerland he ran in and took the Spears and jerked them into his own body and died right there he was not the man that destroyed the army that was out there he just said in the hearts of the people to say he done it let's do it right when are we going to start believing God's message right when are we going to start saying it's here amen when are we going to start saying we are the people of God Amen well we'll do it if brother so and so agrees with you brother Dale well then you might as well forget it but I've got the tapes for 1980 from 2002 where at least you can go back that far and find out that I've been hollering and screaming this to you that somebody's got to believe it and stand on it and brother sitting back there he was up there the other day they had to do a a little simple thing of a stint that there's thousands of them done every day probably in Gainesville there's probably hundreds done every day a little old simple thing of putting a stin in your heart you know or vs or whatever you do well they stuck one in him and he died how many times two times that had to bring him back well you know what he wouldn't Hunt No Pope to get an audience with God he wouldn't hunting nobody else I don't think to get an audience what little bit he probably had in his mind he cried out to God and Lord help me we know what he's still alive today amen and like the fellow said things get to getting rough I don't want no secretary I want to talk to the head man cuz I don't want no secretaries I know how secretaries can mispel a lot of things now they might have the the whole Hospital operating on me right that's what about it don't you think it's about time for us to stand up and believe who we are stand up and say who we are amen that we're the Bride of Jesus Christ amen now listen and start living like we're the Bride of Jesus Christ right start acting like we're the Bride of Jesus Christ now how many of you men would like for your wife go on vacation about every third week okay do you get it yeah right when everything going mad she comes in and say I'll see you later I don't think I'm going today now come on we're heading to the word where we're going to bring in adoption we're not saved by works no way but our works prove what we are adoption is the son taking the nature of the father to live like the father to act like the father am what about it come on Brothers what about it is God waiting on me and you right waiting on us we'll get to it this evening we'll pick up right at that point cuz he's waiting on what us to call him on the scene that's right well waiting on us to call him on the scene but church we could at least believe something anyway I sat in the study this week and studied and announced okay we'll have questions and answers and wrote a thing down cuz I knew we wasn't going to have questions and answers but see you don't believe that you don't believe that God can just show somebody in his own Spirit of saying don't write anything else down you ain't going to have time for it you're going to have to preach it this way because there's going to be company coming there's going to be people you got to change your way of state and got to go on a different way how many times have you ever heard me say that but I sit there in the study and say well Lord what's going wrong I get up and walk out of the study without one note written cuz I know something's going to change if we can believe in a god like that why can't we believe that he's waiting on us am to call him on the scene you remember the fellas out on the ship scared to death was Jesus was back there in the boat asleep they went back and said Lord don't you realize that we're we're going to die he said oh you have little faith well yet they
