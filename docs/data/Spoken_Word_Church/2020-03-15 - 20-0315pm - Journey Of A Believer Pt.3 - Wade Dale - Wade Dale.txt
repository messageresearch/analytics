John Hess that was one of the his disciples right after right after he was so either went off the scene or we're still on the scene but that's that's something we need to live by you know faith is not foolish either faith is not foolish we don't tempt God we don't walk out here in the middle of the road and say look you know I God you know you're gonna stop that 40-ton well no he just might let your stupidity kill you but like Martin Luther said he transferred that he saw if God wants to take me but I don't want to do anything to make it any worse you know to forward that and make him doing any quicker but he was living under the promises of God just like we are and he was living under the baptism of the holy ghost that's what that's what makes the Holy Ghost person say during a time like this instead of being scared and our teeth rattling and all these different things so we hold to the truth that God's gonna take care of us we believe in his promises we believe in his benefits and we believe these here and he's real and then and he'll put nothing on us that we can't stand he don't promise that he can put us no more on us then we will put no more on us than we can stand so if you got your Bibles you turn back to Galatians and we'll try to we'll try to get the sanctification I believe it was it was fruitful that we spoke this morning a little bit more on justification because that's a that's a part that's that's your foundation that gets you going that's your start that's your beginning that's where God is going to meet you and become close with you even though you're still a dirty rascal you know like like brother Branham said you know he God picks the bottle up out of the mud and it still got mud all over it but yet he's gonna he's got a purpose for it he did pick it up so he is gonna have a purpose for it so we've got an update on brother Donnie Reagan and I didn't read it I've got leaning younger but he's okay they're still running some tests on him his heart's fine from what they from what they know so far so let's just keep him in prayer there him and brother on brother Dale and all the different ones but Homer I hear he's got to have some test run Devil's trying his best he's trying his best but he can't he might win a battle but he ain't winning the war he can't win the war we already wrecked we already read the battle plan we always we know who the generals are we know who the winners are and we know who'd losers are so and if it's an ever if it's an ever changing Word of God can't fail can't family and the battle plans not gonna change either this is still it this is the way we get to it through justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost there'll be battle battle battle battle battle but the war has already won Amen so I also remember next Sunday will be a brother clods April the 18th the Spring Fling April the 19th one service brother Dale's birthday dinner will be that Sunday and we will have it will be catered by the church June 18th to the 20th remember the Father's Day fishing trip the sisters were going somewhere too and Jim reminded me just a minute ago brother you remember brother Murphy the the Chinese brother that did the work brother Bissell's he's up there now but he reported back that six believers in China have been arrested for distributing Bibles in that country three of them have been released in three of them are still in jail so we're going to pray that God's gonna he's gonna he's going to take a pall in Silas and he's gonna we pray they praying and the doors of that prisons gonna open and they're gonna walk out so you say well they're halfway around the world it yeah so what I hope God I hope your God is close to you and can get to you in the time of trouble you can hey man he's naughty he's over there with him now and I believe he'll bring them out I mean there's not a governor government can dan against the Word of God not one not one thing can stand against the Word of God so we just believe that so let's bow our heads and get started lord thank you today that you've give us a time of worship that we've come together Lord to hear a little bit more about you Lord I pray Lord that you would just be with us during the service be the active participant Lord be the one that does the speaking and the revealing there be any one that needs healing today Lord we pray that you touch them now in their body and in their spirit Lord we pray that you touch brother Donnie brother all the different ones for the Homer dad brother Ron Lord seems like Satan is trying to attack the fivefold ministry Lord but you said it would it would it would happen it's gonna come but Lord we've already won so we pray that you just help us through this battle Lord that we're going through and the will see a victory on the other side father just give us our daily bread be with the foreign missionary field Lord and touch them Lord we know that things are being closed down and shut down because of this little virus and I pray Lord though it doesn't matter what the world's condition is I pray that you would take care of that virus Lord because people are dying it is humanity that we're talking about Lord it's our true brothers and sisters Lord doesn't matter if they're Christian or not Lord we're all made you said of one blood so we pray that you would just take that thing and turn it down Lord and get rid of it in the name of Jesus cost the whole bride around the world please Lord the blood on the whole place a whole United States of America and all the different countries Lord we plead Lord that you would touch each one Father and that you'll cover them Lord and and that the thing will be done away with Lord this little thing that's bothering Lord we have things that bothers all the time and we don't need another thing to bother us Lord we pray that you would just bless us now put us in Goshen for a little while that we'll hear from you Lord in Jesus name we pray amen you know that's where Israel was it didn't matter about the plagues everything was dying and going on there was frogs fleas flies and all kind of stuff going on and here's that could you imagine being an Egyptian and looking over into the country of Goshen and you go I think I'm gonna be within people over there there's plagues over here why because God told him God told him where to go put him in the land of Goshen even in joke during Joseph's time when Joseph came about he put them in Goshen so that was the promise or the time of them to use while the plagues were going on so pray that God put us all in Goshen as this plague continues on the face of the earth the Galatians 3 16,000 to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not in the seeds of the many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ so there's only one seed we're dealing with it's not natural genealogy it's spiritual genealogy I'm am and this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before of god in christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot dissin all that it should make the promise of none effect in other words bringing the law in bringing all anything you brought in is not going to dissin oh the Covenant that God made with himself because he didn't make with another Hebrews 6 verse 13 let's go to that where when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself we're gonna read in just a minute he says I will I will I will saying surely blessing I will bless them multiplying I will multiply thee so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word brother Brahim said as he just Melchizedek I'm gonna read it this afternoon when Abraham met him he was Melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do now now who's an attribute all born-again believers are attributes of God ma'am all right so all attributes will do in the final end he unfolds in other words what's he saying he unfolds in the walk or life of Abraham what all of us are gonna go through at the final in so today we look every son of Abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing no I want you to watch here what we have become in other words he's preaching the message of who is this Melchizedek we know that that wasn't many people I've reading a few comment commentaries they argued that it's a priesthood they argue that it's of this but the Bible clearly says the man the man no Cassady didn't have father a mother didn't have beginning of days and then and the wife brother Brown said Christ is the only person that could be a man so we're looking at now that in our journey with with Abram God didn't appear in that form to him as we look in the Bible we see in Genesis 12 and all the different verses he says Lord Lord and the Lord said and the Lord appeared now if you look in the different in margins in your Bible especially we got Scofield Bible it says theophany so so God met Abram in different forms but he didn't never met him in human flesh until he come to Melchizedek well we were just reading that in the scripture this morning where he met him in justification and like I said before you know you and I meet God in human flesh according to the prophet of God us living under an open book now knowing where Melchizedek is and what he's doing he's inside of all of us he's inside of all of us a man so who is this mill Cassady well it's the bride of Jesus Christ brother Branham revealed him is showing me that it was Christ but war is Christ now the Bible says it's Christ in you the hope of glory and where does the priesthood come from where is all judgment going to come from all judgment is not going to be by Jesus Christ himself the Bible says while all will be jumping it's gonna be judged by you you're the one the Bible said the Saints will judge the earth by what by the crisis inside of you and you cannot you and I can judge because of what Christ has already done to me that's the great justification see that's justification that goes on up higher in the pyramid that not we know and we can go through many many stages were the RAM talks about justification and then he gets to the point where we come to the highest form of justification that the real you didn't do it to begin with but now we got to stay a baby for him justification because the real you did do it well we can't blame it I want a devil we can blame on we can blame him for one thing and that's he anointed us to do it but we went ahead and did it anyway just like we were telling the young adults by last weekend you know it's you talk about predestination well predestination is really easy it's you know God predetermined your journey but he predetermined by your choice he knows that you and I Adam and Eve if they were put on free moral agency all of us are still put on free moral agency we can press play when we won't do we can stop what we're doing what we want to now we can be influenced by these different things and under justification you watch Abram Abram coming from an idol worship and daddy and he comes and he walks he gets into Canaan and he likes it pretty good but then he has a little bit of a trouble and then he has to move out he has to get it there's a famine in the land so he has to move in to eat it well he moves into Egypt and he starts having problems well that's the same way you and I on our justification journey of justification listen you gonna have problems right up to the day your bodies change but you should not be able to you should not let the problems that you had before determine what you're gonna do this is just simplest for the for the I'm telling you for everybody but we all need this and I hope and pray that somebody today our or wherever you are wouldn't understand one thing if you haven't went through this journey don't fool yourself you're not born again it's all I've been in a list listened justification true justifications when God justifies you the list is gone your slate is wiped clean you have no more problems yeah well you've got problems in your brain but you have no more problems you don't have to ask forgiveness for what you did 20 years ago if you've truly been joy Steff I'd say nobody we can't do that and Satan can't do that he remembers it cuz he was there we were in partners with him right but now God has wiped out from his memory and all I wanted to do is be wiped from his memory not mine I can handle I can handle my human memory because it's there and seems like the things we forget we shouldn't forget and the things we don't forget we should forget so everybody got that yeah me too every day so justification though is is God forgot it and he's never gonna bring that back out so be be and I'm satisfied in and I was thinking the other day we the other night we were discussing something here and I went home and I was like lord I I used to be you know X Y Z you need to see you do the same thing you ever sit around it's the Lord I used to well are you having a conversation with Regina oh you have a conversation with you not having a conversation with God because he's the he's like surprised it ever happened what do you mean but see even in that when you speak it it never goes into his memory and it never goes into your your slate even at justification your slates clean from their back but now brother Brown said though the root of evil is still there we'll tell me this morning and as you continue to walk it adds back up again they got that same man because you'll go right back into doing the things that you did before even truly justified but you won't do that for a long period of time now don't tell me God justifies you 20 years ago when you smoked drank cussed had four wives three husbands and blah blah blah and say well I'm still justified well you were twenty years ago but you've your inventory has caught up with you everybody got that so that's why we need to do like Abram Abram kept walking and he stepped into sanctification what's cleaned him up and got him ready to be put in service he had to make a next step you and I we're you know we're in a journey and a journey as always one foot in front of the other the man we all adjourn E is one if you ever stop remember god doesn't stop so if you stop guess where you're at you're way behind all right so God's gonna start here we're gonna start in now in Genesis chapter 15 let me just run through justification just for a minute to catch them up but remember this covenant is unconditional if you're connected to this covenant you can't lose because God said I will and and don't go to it now I'm just gonna read it because we're gonna come right back to it in just a minute listen God never has a hard way of doing things even when he came here on earth in human flesh he said he'd spate like a common man he sent us a seventh grade education prophet not some highly-skilled psychologist that had 42 years of degrees no he sent us an ain't and it ain't in the hate preacher that we can all understand everybody can understand what he said alright so God's not you know who's confusing the devil alright so in June in Genesis chapter 12 when God starts this journey or Abram starts this journey with God he says I will make thee a great nation I will bless thee make thy name great and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee so it was always God in this covenant he's going to do it now you don't hear that much anymore but when we get over here a little bit further we see when we get into the new birth if we get into it this afternoon for naught we'll get it to it later in Genesis 17 he starts right back in verse 6 and I will make the exceedingly fruitful and I will make nations of the and I will establish you so you see it's God doing the work the whole time it's God doing the work all the time and you have got to respond to that event our response to that is what happened right how'd y'all get here so quick don't stand don't stand back I like senators get in the building they peeking through the window yeah this is the place you're supposed to be you're looking for a church brother good to have you back hey man thank you that God give you a say I don't think y'all all fit on there hello mercy mercy it's good to have them back that's good y'all fly down here yeah I'll fly down here yo you make second service yeah let's see yeah cheeseburger through the drive-through and come on down right okay they were in a journey but we see Abram Abram is one thing to me is Abram listen his whole journey was full of circumstances but he never he never stopped and said well because of that I'm just gonna quit because of this I'm just gonna quit I'm 80 well I'm 75 years old fixing to be 86 and have a kid with Hagar and he never said well I've done all I know he's okay Lord here well here we go because God told him you know be that he was going to be a father of many nations and then we're gonna read in just a minute where where God says Abram quit looking at your age quit looking at the numbers God don't work in numbers he no more with one person then the devil can do with 75 billion people doc can do more with one person he took this one person called Abram that was coming out of a house of idol worship and coming into a place to where now every Christian that is a Christian has to walk in that same journey water an important man and I hope he can say that about all of us that our journey connects with that journey of Abram to Abraham because that's what if we if Abram would have never got to Abraham we wouldn't be using his name because Abraham is a there many nations Abram was just high father that was no promise in that name there was no promise in Sarah's name her name had to be changed to Sarah your name had to be changed to Christian for your journey to be worth anything ma'am that all right so justification in Roman streets is being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God has set forth to be a partition participant sorry perpetuation I got to slow down through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness never declare yours declare his righteousness if I live under his righteousness then everything's going to be okay to declare I say at this time his righteousness Paul says Romans 3 verse 26 that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus no one can justify your past except God no one because your past is not worth justifying that's why he has to clear it off but remember like I said before if you don't continue on to that next walk then you're just piling your sin back on top of itself it's a new thing it's the new sin that's coming now okay cuz I listen I believe truly God forgives people because the Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved they didn't say believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be born again you saw oh there's a difference there's a definite difference in being saved and born again brother mom tells us that that's the difference in that you can be saved one - where people get it all mixed up you can be saved one day and not the next you can get a lack of justification because if you you truly said God forgive me of what I'm doing for you me and my sin he's just to forgive that person but that person hasn't been caught enough to go on to sanctification where they stand that's why the you know them the Baptist once saved always save you you go to a funeral to a guy that had darkened the doors in the Baptist Church for 30 years but that letter sitting in the file that 30 years ago right that he came up and made a what like a decision it comes up and makes a decision shakes their hand with the preacher turns around they get you letter of recommendation out and then that saves you once they'd always say now see that's a lie if it's done that way you heard what I said because once saved always saved that's where justification of the sanctification to the baptism the Holy Ghost to a glorification so if you once truly saved you'll go on to be sanctified and you'll go on to be filled with the Holy Ghost so that all right say man all right so now we as message believers just don't believe in being saved save just part of the journey now if that person comes and does and and truly confesses their sin and God knows us as far as we're gonna go and they die tomorrow they will be given eternal life but they're not bribed they don't come under the blessings and benefits of being a child of God they come under the lock benefit and then you got that they come under the lock benefit where lot gets eternal life because the Bible says it makes his righteous soul he just nicked what what what he didn't have enough word to get him out of Sodom and Gomorrah he didn't respond enough to God to get him out of Sodom in the world but he's going to be saved and that's okay but I want to be brown I want to be called a son and daughter of God because if I'm called a son and daughter of God I don't it's not what I do I don't ever stand in judgment cuz that's the whole thing I'm telling you that's one of the Lord I believe the Lord really if he'll reveal it to you the great one of the greatest revelations in this message is is that you never have to stand judgment hey don't scare me anymore don't scare me anymore why because you've been born again God's not just eradicated the old you he don't even remember the old you the whole you is gone but now remember in justification though the real you still here are the person that did it made you do that that root of evil he's going to make her heart more pliable though so we can begin to deal with because he begins to deal with Abram but when we get to this next journey of sanctification we see that that steps up into a little bit higher level we sees there there's more of an intimacy between Abram and God there should be more of an intimacy between you because remember he's gonna eat you can't clean yourself up but if the Bible says the unclean spirit goes out of a man walking dry places now how's that unclean spirit get out he doesn't leave of his own accord and at that point you're not wishing that it's gone hello you still like that old devil but under the power of the word of God and doing what God says and and the benefit of that is is that Satan don't like Corey's hat anymore so he gets out he gets out he can't stand to be around a good Christian and when you start bringing yourself into this environment and reading your Bible and studying and Being Earnest talking to brothers and sisters forgetting the things that are past read the Bible about what he's already said about you all the benefits Satan hates that I like what brother what was his name the brother that was here that was a brother Richard Wilson's church the older man anyway he would read the Bible and he'd have a headache or something means he's okay devil we're fixing to read the Bible if you want to read it through my eyes go ahead but I'm fixing the read where God says by His stripes I'm healed brother straighter thank you my brother straighter old brother straighter he said now devil if you go to play you gonna look through these eyes right here then we gonna read the Bible because the devil is not gonna ever tell you to read the Bible he hates that thing he hates that book so get that thing out now don't do like my aunt nervy she always made her boys ride with a Bible in her car when they had a wreck the Bible just got tore up I'm here they didn't I don't think it helped much at all by having it right here but if you'll take it out and read it and let it become a part of you yeah that's the difference so that's Abram moving higher toward Abraham in this journey of sanctification let's read Ezekiel 11 verse 17 this is kind of where we ended I think we'll stay in sanctification today and then we'll just move to the Holy Ghost next next time with preach therefore saying thus saith the Lord God I will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered and I will give you the land of Israel now he's talking about unnatural people and also in when we get and read Ezekiel a little bit later on Ezekiel 36 remember you remember the story of the dry bones you have bones and they're not together they're just laying out in the field then the dry bones begin to come together and then there has to be a breath to make them living and see that's why you're you're dead until you're alive in Christ you're just a dead bunch of bones walking around all you really are brother Ram said cannon-fodder listen we really have no worth as a human being unless you're born again what worth do you have oh you can be you can be Bill Gates and you can be Donald Trump or you know any famous person yet but there's nobody more famous than the bride of Jesus Christ nobody nobody there's nobody walk the face of this earth more famous than you guys are nobody I mean you're talking about the Hall of Fame this one goes for an eternity all these other ones are gonna be dust and they're gonna be done away with and literally be ashes but you and I will not there's an eternal quality that man cannot give you notoriety and Fame on this earth is okay everybody likes to have their back padded and all that stuff but I'd rather be a child of God than in your laughs and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things that's what you're doing everything that you're doing in justification is a detestable thing don't tell me you did anything while you were out in the world that was that was nice and good and sweet oh yeah like I said before even you you take that all that list I showed you you're born again you know you don't have to you have to go around the line to your wife and you don't have to lie to your husband you don't lie to your kids people are the kids all the time then why they have to make up stories and things you know I'm not my Christians I'm talk about people in the world so you just it's just a snowball of sin and you just can't get out of that rat race that Satan's got you in and the sin just keeps piling up until you move over and get out of that thing and once you get out of that thing you start walking with God and everything he does is a blessing to you and they shall come through them they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations therefrom see what what's God doing he's cleaning you up he's taking all the detestable things all the Obama all the abominations and I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you now we're fixing to talk about justification I mean sanctification and I will take the Stoney heart out of your flesh what's a stony heart hard we all were hard-hearted before we got what into this walk of God come on we all were so God gives us a what a heart of flesh that's liable that God can mold and use because you know what if you're on the real journey of God he's the Potter you're the clay he's the one doing the molding he's the one doing the making and you know why he may have to start over again but it's the same lump of clay you know why he starts over because we decide to jump off the wheel have you ever watched somebody make pottery well we lived there I mean with you the pottery center of the United States of America and you watch them do that they throw this thing on there that just look it so muddy and filthy and it's just a pile of mud laying there but in the Masters hand he can make a beautiful design just with his fingers you don't have to go get this and that in the other and you know how to get it to God give him the tools he needed right here and he was starting he matches that thing in the middle then he reaches and gets it on the side and he brings the walls of that part up and then he makes a lip that's all he has to do makes a beautiful pie but then you got to put it in the keel then you got to put it in the fire cuz that's what we're fixing to get to with Abram Abrams got to go through the fire we all have to go through the fire but I will put them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you and I will take the Stoney heart out of your flesh and we'll give them a heart of flesh all right so let's go and let's look at sanctification we're gonna start in Genesis 15 but I'll read these two scriptures first if you want pull those up brother Joe Hebrews 2 verse 11 for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one you see how close we're getting with God now you're not one with God and justification you're starting your beginning but you still he can't he can't God will not dwell in an unclean vessel and you're still unclean at that period of time everybody got that all right now listen he's getting ready to reach in that soul and take that a damning nature that ungodly unclean nature and he's fixing to change it but he's got to go through a process everything's got to go through a process oh I wish that God would have in 1998 just Lois I wish God would have just said boom you're born again you're going to be preaching in 2020 and the roses start being thrown and the and and the party starts and we have cake and ice cream and you're right it's been a hard 20 something years but thank God for it because it's the journey for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call us brethren a he he was ashamed to call you brethren even in justification because you still had that old Adamic nature you still had that old root of evil and you still were evil you are just coming into a place to where God can use you saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church while I sing praise unto thee alright so now let's go to the next one ezekiel 36 verse 24 through 26 for I will make you from take you from among the heathen oh did he not did he not take us from among the heathen hey man he took a heathen and brought him out of the heat of them heathenism for I will take you from among the heathen gather you out of all countries and will bring into your own land then I will sprinkle clean water upon you oh boy and you shall be clean sanctification cleaned and set aside for service for all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you what a promise a new heart also will I give you and then you spirit will I put within you now that's not the Holy Spirit amen I'll I'll read you're quoting them and if you need one a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you an heart of flesh so let's go to genesis 15 let's see what happened to abram now remember he's still abram now remember still in your journey through justification you're not a born-again believer at that time your soul is still dark and black thereby got that same am during sanctification when you come to your first part of sanctification the unclean spirit is still there it has to be driven out by the washing of water of the word by your journey he has to continually how you washed by the water of the word you listen to the word I don't want to hear no church sermons when I was in the world I avoided them now you can't avoid them now you can't avoid them because you want to know more about God you want to know more they say after these things they look that keyword right there that key phrase we went through Genesis 12 through 14 in justification in the life of Abram and the Bible says after these things so in other words you've got to do them but after you do them this is what the next part of your journey is after these things the word of the Lord now listen there wasn't no word of the Lord back then look there was no word of the Lord in other words Abram didn't walk over and pick up a Bible there was no such thing he didn't even go and pick up the scroll they weren't written yet so the word of the Lord came spoken to Abram and said in a vision look it's come closer now in a vision fear not Abram whatever is fixing to happen I'm on the scene and I'm gonna take care of you because you're fixing to go because remember sanctification see justification you're still you know you're one guy in you you still got that unclean spirit in you but you like I said you got that little halo of light you got a little something that's churning it's not in here yet but it's right here and it's working Satan hates it he don't even like to feel that thing not that true that true no he ain't taking them personate lights and the winnings and all that stuff but that one that's fixing to make you a born-again believer he hates it told us Jesus Christ himself in the form of the Holyoke hey man everybody got that cuz I'm gonna read it to you in a minute what happens to Abram in his journey so here's Abram he keeps walking so fear not Abram something's fixing to be tore out of you sanctification is when God tears that unclean spirit out of you and it's violent didn't Jesus tell us he said I didn't come to bring peace I've come to bring violence because the kingdom has of God has to be taken by what no no no no no no no no no no Michael goes oh wait did tickle they shouldn't tickle should've hurt where's my real knife but that's what happens because you know what Satan is comfortable inside you that's where he's been for a while he's comfortable yeah but when you get to where you start listening the Word of God and you start doing the things of God tell me what happens it's a battle and it's not it's bloody it's force it's not that no the Lord comes and says I've come to take over that's mine and I've come to take over so what does he do fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward what a promise and Abram said now if you'll boy brother Dale long if we go back to this it'll take another sermon brother Dale preach a sermon about this the the wording of Lord and God and the capital and all that but when I get into that but watch what that's never been spoken from 12 till now everybody got that those of you that have been through all this before all the years you know that that position now puts Lord God it brings closeness even even Scofield picks it up if you got your Scofield Bible here it says hang on a minute yeah I lick my fingers start about there I don't wash my hands Lord God even Lord God Lord is a tone I and Lord God is Adonai Jehovah which brings that he's never called that before so here is what are you saying brother way God's getting closer and closer and closer to having that full dominion over you Lord Jehovah I don't I I am I in other words I've come to take over a neighbor and said Lord God never said that before he always said Lord and the Lord appeared and God appeared and all these different things but if you want to get that sermon maybe Joe can find it it's been long mercy 10 or 15 years ago because that means something the capital Ord the capital capital al the little Ord are the big G little Oh luli it all means something it's not just it's not just somebody made a mistake there's a position in there and the scholars when they translated the Bible they noticed that position that God was in so you'll see sometimes capital L capital o capital R capital D like you see in the in the Book of Revelations you see king of kings and Lord of lords you see capital K but a lowercase but when you go over to revelations 19 I believe it is when he rides back in the Millennium with us all capital letters why it's in his fullness and then you ought to listen to that because brother down don't beaten watch your hand watch your weekend he's he said I'm taking for myself okay don't shake your shoulder up there too much but that means that's the position in other words that never happened in justification in his walk it was either Lord or God glory calf there's a position now watch as God is coming and brain more revelation more vision right saying fear not Abram in other words you're fixing to go through something that nobody else's went through before you're fixing to go through something that's going to look horrible but I'm in it and Abram said Lord God what will they'll give me seeing I go childless now Abram is bringing the promise that God made back to him he said now God I was 75 now I'm in my eighties it's not looking real good but what God say fear not Abram I got this thing handled seeing I go childless in the store to my house as this Eliezer of Damascus and Abram said Behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is my ner scroll all the way up to the top so think see now look and behold the word of the Lord now here we go wasn't into what written in the book God had to tell Abram saying this shall not be thine heir he tell Minnelli's or not God God said Abram I told you what I was gonna do so let me handle it okay let me handle it because if you start handling it you're gonna mess up and he did cuz remember God said he would have a promised son he said all these things but he never he never reveals the whole plan to us because we can't stand it it's like somebody was talking about in the Youth Bible studies they was talking about the seals and the different things and explaining the third pull you know let's get them born again first you can explain I've had the third pull explain to me since I was 14 years old and I hardly know much more about it than I did then but you do know more but that wasn't part of my salvation that wasn't that's not going to get you in the rapture now you will be a recipient of it but knowing it will not get you there at this point this point in Abraham's life listen remember that that time when you were it was a tender parting a lot in your journey to me it was a tender part because man you you're getting this unclean spirit you're getting it driven out of you something that's really comfortable that you really enjoyed and you really humanely don't want to get rid of it hello somebody be honest but then you come to a place like you said you come to place and said get rid of this thing you've tried to do it yourself your mama tried to do it your sisters tried to do it extra would love that try to beat it out of ya and she's going see that's Catholicism penance you don't have to do none of that just let go and let God let go of that demon cuz you're pulling on the demon on this side Thank You Damon and and hear hear and God God pull it over on this side i'ma rip that thing but here's the devil and I want this guy but what's God saying he's mine somebody's gotta let go hey man so you finally decided who was gonna let go and it was you cuz you were the one that was holding both of them they weren't holding you you were pulling on them hello you was the one who had the struggle God did have a struggle he knew what she's gonna do the devil was struggling cuz he was fixing to lose you but you just let go and took God he said don't worry Abram I still got you don't worry about I know I told you you gonna have a promise sir I told you you're gonna have all these kids that you can't even you can't even count the sand on the on the on the ocean what about that you ever tried to count just that much of a saying in the ocean can't count it so God said Oh Lord what and you do that in sanctification you come to a place you feel like a baby that just come out of a womb you're like it's cold I've been in this warm place and everything's been alright and I've been floating in water for nine months and now I gotta breathe enough oh good grief I need to eat yeah that's what happened you've been put in a different environment that's why environment is very very important Abrams Abrams environment was very very important where he went where he went and when he come out of and when he went and come out of like I said before he went down there and helped blot and got a lot out of the situation he was in but he didn't stay down there he went back up to his property and then okay and he brought him forth abroad instead look now toward heaven he brings Abram right back around tells him the same promise he told him cuz you know what sometimes we have to be told over and over and over again Amanda that still now and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the Stars if they'll be able to number them he said unto Him so shall thy seed be now what look in Abraham's humanity he probably was still doubting cuz we always doubt our first deal is to doubt our first human thing is is why who when where how the Bible says he believed in the Lord and the Lord counted to him for righteousness right there he believed that God whatever you're gonna do I can't do it you're gonna have to do it and he said unto him I am the Lord and hers that I am I am the Lord that brought thee out he goes back and tells him said look you remember that journey you just started in a few years ago I'm still the same person I'm still the same guy that's gonna bring you out of all this I am the Lord that brought thee out of ur of Chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it what's the land we're inheriting not physical land but the baptism of the Holy Ghost the promise is what you and I have claims to sure we're going to I can live on this earth but if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's gonna be tough to get back to this piece of property and he said Lord God here he is again Lord God and I'm intimately talking with whoever this person is now whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it and he said to him take me an heifer now watch this is where it gets a little tricky and watch what God makes Abram go through and without a prophet we would just read over this and wonder what in the world does a why is he going through all this but I'm gonna read you some quotes afterwards what brother Brown said about this part of Abraham's journey but we're gonna read it just like it is in the Bible now watch and he said unto Him take me an heifer of three years brother and says watch that three three years old and a she-goat of three years old and you know what a she-goat was used for in the Bible remember rams was made for sacrifice for Jesus like was a type in Jesus Christ you know what does she go this she goat according to numbers 15 27 was an ignorance offering if you ignorantly done something and didn't know the law and didn't know the you know the what you know the law of the land you could take a she-goat and kill a she-goat for an ignorance offering and God would forgive you for your ignorance praise God we're all pretty ignorant give me a she-goat but what's he doing ever a she-goat so there's his ignorance offering a ram typing Christ if three years old and a Turtledove and a young pigeon now you bring the Turtledove and a young pigeon in a little bit later but do you know what that's an offering for we'll get to it in a minute and he took into him all these and divided them in the myths now Abram all these pieces of these animals are laying on this altar cut up in pieces but the but the birds divided he not that is an offering for healing signifying that it's not going to be torn apart well well let brother branham explain it later he took unto him that now what are you doing brother listen Abraham's journey this is his sanctification journey this is where God's gonna clean him up and put him into service so he's got to go through all these sacrifices listen folks honestly it's a sacrifice to come to church I know we want to come I know there's something in my heart that wants to come to church but it's a sacrifice never brother Branham told that guy he said you had a you had a horrible fight between church and here and he said brother what happened he said I got into church but he just didn't see that the demons and everything else and he had all these problems and like I was telling y'all last Sunday they the church that's where the guy kept seeing the husband a wife before they walked in the door they would hold hands and they would pray and they said all that's so sweet and so wonderful said brother that's good that you pray to getting right he said brother we prayed to get that spirit off of us cuz we've been arguing since we left the house so at least they didn't bring it in here how many of y'all do that hmm they won't stop and have a drink of water on now if you don't bring it in if you don't bring it in here it makes the service go a whole lot better that's why singing drives unclean spirits out David always played and Saul spirit was quieted because of the that's why we have a song service all right so he took all these now watch the here's Abraham's walk with God hearing sanctification and I'll let brother Brahm explain all this but I'll come in as we go through and then we'll stop here in just a minute on we will do the Holy Ghost later on and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and ladies peace one against another but the birds divided he not and when the fowls with them foul spirits and they're right there when them foul spirits come Abram drove him away because you know what them foul spirits are gonna keep trying to come back remember the unclean spirit goes out of a man walking Dry places seeking Fred finest none turns right around and wants to go back to the comfort of his house but Abram had enough about him in his journey where Abram stood there and drove those foul spirits off of those carcasses because those carcasses were sacrifices all right everybody okay with that we're getting somewhere with this this is we look this is the more intimate even at this point when you see Abraham's journey he had nothing to do with it now God is going to bring Abram to a place to where he's going to need him to do these things but then he's gonna put him to sleep watch this and when the Sun was going down brother Braun said it was in the evening time when the Sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo a horror of great darkness fell upon him and he said unto Abram no of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in the land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them for hundred years what say what's he telling Abram you're can't your people the children of Israel are gonna go in bondage for 400 years nobody got that right and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge and afterwards shall they come out with a great substance that's Moses bringing the people out of Egypt remember because what is Redemption coming out and going in and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace as I shall be buried in a good old age what a promise some of us are reaching that pinnacle but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet fulfilled now remember what did the angel tell brother Branham when he was getting ready to go to Israel he said you can't go there because the iniquity of the amorite is not full yet he said but it's getting pretty full so that prophecy has come right down to today and it came to pass that when the Sun went down and it was dark and behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between a light a burning lamp passed between these pieces in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram now he'd made one with him before it was unconditional I have no watch but he says look this is the land grant in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram now see that capital is L capital L capital old capital R capital D maybe brother Dale will preach that again maybe maybe brother della preached that again and those of us that have not been around for a while okay all right he'll preach whatever y'all want him to write that's what brother Braun said you pull on the preacher and you make him preach what do you want what you need in the same day the Lord capital L or D made a covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river a to the great river the river now this is natural land he's giving him this natural land so you got to keep the natural story in there some all right the K Knights cannot catamites Hittites / sites refuse amirite Canaanites gege site Jeb shots web sites those web sites is the ones we got to get rid of then web sites all they might okay though that you've not heard that you haven't been around a while now look let's explain now if you want to stop that brother Joe let's read what brother Brown says about this because I want him to explain it and it won't be me explaining it to be him brother Brown preached on the unconditional covenant 1954 there you go thank you what's closed now when he then when he came down the Holy Spirit to talk to Abraham in the garden out there where he was laying on the hill he put a burr ham to sleep now Abram it should be Abram but we hear brother Brown says Abraham you haven't got one thing to do with it alright you lay here now and Abraham went to sleep you're out of the picture and the next thing now what's God go to do he's confirming and given an evidence when you come to sanctification God is obligated to give you an evidence of where you're at because you unclean spirits going out something I mean you're you're standing there completely empty God's got to come in and show you what he's doing he did me I don't know you gonna have to realize he did it for you he's given an evidence or a proof to Abraham how he's gonna do it how he's gonna do it listen if you want to be healed how he's gonna do that this then Abraham I'm shutting you out of the picture I'm putting you to sleep then before Abram came a black thickness after look every sinner deserves to go to hell because remember you're still a sinner until you're born again you're still a sinner God does not reside in your soul until the new birth everybody got that same man so you're not out of the woods yet Abram was not out of the woods he was still in trouble he still needed a sacrifice he still needed a light to appear every sinner deserves to go to hell blackness then after that of smoking burning furnace every sinner deserving in other words hell Abraham that's what you deserve but beyond that when a little white light that little white light went right between those pieces of sacrifice right back and forth the white light moving showing making a confirmation showing to Abraham that he would do someday through his seed Isaac bringing on Christ for the supreme sacrifice now hidden life in Christ 1955 let's read that one you see people it's nice people because remember the unclean spirits going out right at sanctification the unclean spirit goes out of sanctification and then God brings you to a position watch what he does you've seen people that was nice people but you just couldn't hardly stand to be around them there's some there's something about them they got a creative power around them that just seems to be different how I'd like to stop here if I was possible and tell you some things on that you're a little created yourself he said he'd give you a new spirit now we'll go back to Ezekiel he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit isn't God's Spirit everybody got that that's your spirit God gives you a new spirit then he says I'll put my spirit in him that's that the new birth we'll cover that a little bit later but the thing God has to do is give you a new spirit Abram he has to tell you the sacrifice has already been made it's laying out here before you and I'm gonna pass that little white light that's been following you I'm gonna run it through these sacrifices and I'm gonna tell you that I'm the one that's gonna do it not you because what happens to that light at the new birth it goes inside I'll put my spirit in him but the thing God has to do is give you a new spirit maker now look it's it doesn't say change your nature it says make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't even live with you so he has to get you fixed up first Thank You Kentucky English so he have to get you fixed up first before he can come in in other words God's just not going to take and say well alright you're justified you start your journey you still got the unclean spirit but I'm fixing to write inside of you know you don't work that way you know what you wouldn't know how to handle it you wouldn't know how to handle I've always said the reason that God sent justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost is to see how to communicate with God and how God is going to deal with you and brother Branham came on the scene right after the Pentecostal church if he would have came on the scene right after a lucre nobody would have accepted me they thought he's crazy but but coming up with the Pentecostals God had moved out into the Pentecostal age so that was Pentecostals everywhere so brother I'm just slid right in and fit right in with him if he didn't went in a Lutheran Church at first no so I same way with God he's getting you ready to dwell inside of you because God's not gonna dwell in an unclean vessel so he has to get you fixed up first before he can come in I'll give you a new spirit then you take him anywhere you go all kinds of places he's got to get you fixed so you can entertain him right you're an entertaining God right where you neither was I a man but we come to a place to where now we entertain God the right way let's go to number four the Intervale notice you put a new spirit God has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him you can't get along with yourself that old devil spirit you had in you sweet little sweet sweetly sweetly look out sweet devil devil yeah all the way at least my own nose that was the truth if you'll admit it God can help you wow that's confession that's why that's why the confession is good for the soul you had to confess cuz you know what you were harboring all that illness Nolet junk your that was inside of your nose eating you up but get it out confess your faults one to the other even few Christians get faster Falls one or the other you don't like me as your problem sorry mmm just kidding so he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit amen oh here man to self I will put a new spirit in them and I will put my spirit in them now that's not the plaintiff ocation that's going on to put when he says my who's writing the Bible God and he's the my I'm gonna put my spirit in them and he said look but he said after he's give you a new spirit that's you don't get it confused with God's Spirit it's not it's your new spirit so you can get along with the Holy Spirit if he ever gives it to you oh brother Branson if he ever gives it to you but that's that unclean spirit and we see if we could keep on but we'll stop right there oh because remember Sarah Sarah gets involved and although Sarah is the womb that that's got that the child's got to come through naturally speaking you got that she was not a believer at first and she talked to Abram and said Abram you and I have been listen this is devil logic you and I have been living together for 40-something years and we ever produced a child but I got this right here I got this woman Hagar and it's lawful it's legal under what they were living under it's legal but it wasn't legal Dov God because God is going to bring that promised son through Abraham and Sarah not Hagar so you see what happens even in sanctification we still make mistakes we still miss the direction of God we still do things wrong but we're one step a little bit closer to what to get in that new spirit so that God can work on that new spirit because brother Ram tells us in sanctification you become into a religious order where you become religious you become thinking more religious but be careful otherwise I've always stated be careful in that position because Satan can say oh that's the new birth you shouted you've read forward message books this week hadn't you so it's the devil if I'm read more now oh I've been in the message for 50 years I'm sitting here I listen to tapes every day that don't mean one thing to go not one because that would be by works that covenant was not by works that covenant was by grace are you saved through what faith the faith of Abraham that is now working in you and I but if you stay in that sanctified condition because remember the unclean spirit goes out God doesn't put his spirit in yet so you're kind of sitting there empty in limbo because the Bible says that he goes and not only goes back into the vessel he brings seven more of his demon buddies with him and he enters into you and makes you religious now cuz Satan knows that there's something changed you want to go to church okay it's fine you go to church but you think about all the other things you want to do and you can you know you can say well this prophets wrong and he's this and this and that you just keep piling up and you sit there all time it's happening all over the world people send a message churches but there's got to come a time that Abram had to make a decision to become Abraham and his decision was God I'm gonna just keep walking I'm gonna just keep going I might that's okay Sarah let's have a child over here well Hagar that's okay I'll do that naturally but that had nothing to do with the promise of God that was just a side note because the Bible says talks about the bond woman in the free woman you and I were born under the bond woman we were bound but when we were born again of the free woman free means a lot different than bound because we remember you are bound until you're loosed you're bound by Satan until God comes in and looses you of that and then you become free Oh young people even adults listen you're never you say oh I've got freedom you did I got freedom I go whatever I want to do and I yeah I can do whatever I want good gun I'm gonna put on the feeling I'm good I'm I'm fine I'm all right no you ain't all right you dead you're dead you're dead you got so many demons on you don't even know what to do but Abram said okay that's all right if I got all that you name them all you want to but uh and I might have a little side note over here you know Hagar we got it okay well it was until God changed his name till he come to a place in his journey to where he looked at God and he said god I can't do this no more I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired I'm sick and tired of somebody telling me that this demon is better than this one that this person says all you need to go you know feeling fulfilled the promise of God you didn't go to another Church you you need to you let go and let God so that's what Abram did Abram did sure he listened to Hagar but what became of that Union it was not a promised son it was Ishmael the wild child that God you know what God did give him a promise it's not one you won't but he gave him all the promise he said you'll be a wild child and everybody will be against you and you won't be against everybody now he didn't give that to Isaac Isaac was the promised son not Ishmael it's why you got that fight going on it's most thought he was a wild child he fought everything and everybody let me steer him he shall be a wild man his hand will be against every man now that don't sound like a Christian and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren in other words you know I'm gonna be able to get rid of him that Damon that came out of you he's not dead he just moved over in another place called your brother or your sister and that's where you persecution I'm talking about that one but that's what I mean but you come to a place to where you just deal like Abram and say look Lord there lays all the sacrifices there lays everything the turtledoves to the I've done everything you've told me to do this and I've killed all these animals I've laid them out here and now Lord if you don't come on the scene I'm good as a dead man so he puts Abram to sleep and he shows him that that's what he deserves he deserves hell every one of us deserve but now we're seeing the difference is if we do the right thing of God then we don't have to go there so when Abram wakes back up what does God do God brings that light he brings that eternal light and he runs it in between all them sacrifices like brother Brown was saying he said that showing God I'm Abraham I'm Abram I'm showing you that I'm gonna send a promise son and he's got to die on a cross and he's gonna be the ultimate sacrifice and people are going to get born again because of that now Abram you're in another time you're not you're going to be a comparison of their journey but you're not ever going to experience what they experienced I've put your sleep you're in you're in another dimension you're in another as we were talking about the other day we now have an updated revelation Abram had a revelation but he really didn't know who God was the person the person the person of God never was inside of him the person of God now though is inside of each and every one of us that Lord God that Abram talked to was standing on the earth one day and they looked at me and you look fifty years old he said before Abraham was I am now they look to him and probably went eight hundred years now you ain't her ears old know what inside of him we're standing there and said Abram get up and walk and Abram communed with that same theophany that was standing in Jesus Christ so you and I have a better situation though that same theophany is not just talking to us it now by the new birth is residing inside of us but it all begins being the faith seed of Abraham that's where it all begins next time we preach we'll start in Genesis chapter 17 which shows the new birth Abram was ninety years old 9 sister value not at all because Abraham Abrams started his real journey at 99 when God came to him and said you're not gonna be able many more I you can't bring a promised child as Abram contentious Sarah sure can't bring it I'm gonna change your name I'm gonna make you a Christian I'm gonna make you like me I'm gonna make you christ-like and that spirit that I gave you that's been hovering around you and that's been helping keep the foul spirits off of those sacrifices I'm now gonna enter inside of you and I'm not gonna reside with you I'm gonna reside in here and I'm gonna help you through this journey you know what the devil can beat your spirit up and the devil can beat your flesh up but the devil can never beat the soul up your soul is as protected as the almighty is protected it cannot lose it cannot diminish it has to grow it has to be so the broom said a creator if he got the Creator inside of you folks and my last point Abram had a name change and then God said finally he said now Abraham you're going to take Sarah your wife you see all the pieces are fitting together now and you're going to have about 28 days from now you're gonna something's gonna happen to you this never happened before I'm gonna change you so that you can have that promise kid I'm gonna change you and I'm not just gonna change you I'm gonna change your wife so when I so when Melchizedek left somewhere about 28 days later about the time of life you ladies know we understand Abraham woke up one day Wow my god I'm in the wrong place and then he looks at his hands I look at my hands and my hands were new I looked at my feet and they were too won't it be time huh it broke Jules here he was looking for you but I'm not gonna try but that's what it was and Abraham looked at Sarah and said you know you can think all you want dude he looked at Sarah and said honey God will never lie to you he's never lied to me in my journey he told me this is the spot that I'm gonna be standing in right when we have this promised child he said I would say it oh I'm a 90 years old and we've been having relations for C you know laundry list then finally God walks up and Melchizedek he meets God in human flesh and Melchizedek says you and Sarah are gonna have this baby you and Sarah and you know what Abram Abram said that now is Abraham you know what he said he said the same thing they said he said be it unto me according to thy word and when you receive the new birth guess that's what you have to do there's nothing you can't cry scream shout all that beforehand you can't do any of that you know they don't know how but when you just drop back and like brother Zack said I got tired of being tired and I come to a place that I can't do it God you gonna have to do it for me I'm 99 years old Abram I've now been changed to Abraham God's giving me a revelation now and he really gave me a revelation when I woke up with my new bride now I know how to get this done that's the same way you've done when you receive the new birth when you truly become born-again in this end time remember what brother Browne said brother Branham says she will know what to do with the word the bride of Jesus Christ in this end time is going to produce the promised son and she will know what to do with the word when it comes Sarah knew Abraham knew Sarah didn't look at Hagar no more and say well let's use this one and Abraham didn't make a hundred thousand excuses they come to a place to where they knew they were going to produce what this Bible had said they were going to produce that's what you and I got to come to that place to where it's not my brother not my neighbor not my sister natural but it's you and I it's late oh nice and God's waiting on us have you ever heard that sermon before God's waiting on us to white let go ain't let God do it but you've got to do what God tells you to do rose axes here's sorry that bro Zack says I'm a changed man I'm a changed man I'm a changed man I change men I'm going testify testify testify sister I'm a changed man change man I get up here three months later and I go where's that black oh he decide to stay out of church today I think he went somewhere with his friends uh oh oh oh everybody the building knows what happened setbacks don't the Devils the Devils got him stuck in sanctification and he thinks he's okay I think slip out you can't slip back out in the world folk not being born again you cannot slip out back into the world we make mistakes upon mistakes upon mistakes but you will not you will not go backwards and God [Music] because that spirit now that brought you to church and everything's fine everybody looks up is that black he's changed he's a changed guy he's a good-looking kid too he's changed guy but they keep watching you to make sure that that change because remember our change is eternal it's an eternal change it's not a change that goes up and sure we have our up and down I'm somebody in humanity but that's not gonna come up three months from now and say well I don't have to go to church the more I just go I just go back with my buddies and I have a beer - I know if the desire is gone I don't say if because of you I say if the desire is gone we don't have to worry about looking for our children anymore if we can get a born again you'll know where they are let's stand to our feet you'll know where they are why because they've received the same spirit you got birds of a feather Eagles of a feather flock together twice acts the first one on the stage look at that goat he's on the front row for the fire follow the journey of Abraham now the next part we got to come to it's really hard because you know what happened to Abraham Abraham at ninety nine years old he had to take a knife which probably wasn't very surgically sharp at that moment and he had to circumcise itself and what the circumcision do it cuts off the old excess skin it cuts off the old excess flesh and that's the type of the new birth that we you can you can't reverse the process there's no reverse process in circumcision 1n done right let's watch the type in the new birth you can't go back who wants to put flesh back on take it off but you love the Lord you gotta learn love the journey of Abraham I every time I speak on this I think of Jimmy Gibson brother Jimmy Gibson passed away good many years ago but I'm telling you I thought I think he was Abraham's brother blood brother because he preached on Abraham buddy he would take it from the Erb child deeds and he'll take him all the way into the Promised Land and I mean he did a really good job but brother Jimmy god bless him he's he's watching over the balcony maybe today and going you know why cuz you had a new birth so we know where he's at even when people pass away we know where they're at there's no wandering there's no worry we know we're there thank God for a prophet let's sing a song to the water been baptized I've been one [Music] the watch was and redeem is now my name opping change I've been reborn [Music] he raised all the furniture different tip man the Lord has his way all my life praise God has been trained though my sins were scarlet they're as white as snow I was bound but today I am [Music] I [Music] then reborn [Applause] Oh very rare oh praise it makes window is way all my life praise the betrayed laughs is for a successful swim fast and now man [Applause] thank me very [Applause] [Music] resumes when the Lord has his weight oh my praise God has betrayed [Applause] [Music] you know I I brag on brothers I bike you know why he got born again he'd been going this church since he's a baby you were born here you were you were I mean a teeny tiny kid when he came to church here but you see the journey he was born here you're old your mom and daddy are too but you see a journey of a child and you watch and you see the ins and outs you see Abram and then you see more maybe he's maybe no didn't quite go far enough but you know what that light still circled that light still circling they're still following you all of you and you know what you get born again I'm gonna brag on you and then go this bragging time it's time to brag that God can still save us all he can still give the new birth doesn't matter throw that canes away oh I can't because because what does one tell me why give me give me something that's why I love the kids asking these questions there's questions that they're asking and like I said this morning don't fear God's here to answer those questions God's come back to get you he's come back to get us cuz you know what we're not going without you guys we're a family not going without my kids brother Johnny's not going Watchers hey man he's all I don't know brother bottom said abraham believed in God so much until he went ahead and bought the booties in the Berta which is the pins and the different things and he was heading toward ninety nine years old you know what he did Abraham's faith produced that child but Abraham's faith when he even was Abram he believed what God said and he just so much has had the baby in his hands why would you buy all the things for it if you didn't know you were gonna have it and God revealed to you that there it is that's the way I look at my children I don't worry about the jury there's a journey for everyone don't worry about the journey just see them sitting on the front row don't get off the front row if you see them on the front row there's the manifestation of the believing that started your whole journey I like to see what God's done I love to believe I believe to see but I like to see it I like to see the manifestation that brother Dale has been preaching for 50 years trying to get us to see something and now finally maybe were able to see it the God is doing something he's bringing children in he's bringing children in he's bringing us all to a place folks don't get left behind you can't put a price on anything in that world nothing eternal life is without money and without price Brother Brown preach that sermon without money and without price listen Bill Gates is gonna stand up one day in the Judgment Day if he's not morning if he doesn't give his heart to God and Bill Gates is gonna say I'll give my 68 billion dollars to your Lord and the Lord is gonna like no we're going to use that for pavement if you if you hadn't done what I said you would have been walking on that and it would have been worth a lot more than you think you compiled while you were here on the earth hey man so let's pile this up let that light if you're not born again today let God knock on your heart and let that light that's been following you all your life let it disappear but let it disappear inside of you don't let it disappear out the door let it disappear right here right here one soul the prophet of God said was worth how many ten thousand world's ten
