========================================

it's recording good morning [Music] surprise surprise it's me I don't think brother white mentioned that piano [Music] teacher didn't be in the world hurt but we don't look in the first Corinthians chapter 2 this will be reading for several scriptures oh love scripture this morning trust everybody's have a good week [Music] first rate this chapter to targeter still reading this morning and he was talking about that really the Queen says the sermon in the waiting trig lasts more than seven minutes and he went 13 but he was good hiding with people there were people from the United States that we're posting online said we've heard prayers lasted longer than when you go to church you don't know how long Turks are gonna be bearing those time limits no there's not they have one sterling service they have a preacher then they have a second song service the black family is in the little church group that was singing for them it was beautiful not stiff and starchy and I just looked at the flags all down through there and her and her gowns and her long training book oh god brother Branham talked about those the bride and coming in they're different oh I'm sorry get back second Corinthians chapter 2 verse 1 and it says and I brethren when I came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God but determine not to know anything among you seek Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet enough the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to nought but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew before had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory but it but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard nor neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of men which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given unto us of God which things we also speak not in the words which man's wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto Him neither and he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no men for who can who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the month of Christ alone long scripture reading this morning that the time good one of thoughts don't pick up this morning Paul says here in verse 12 he says now we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God and you know well it's all coming it was speaking to the Corinthians you know he said I didn't come to speak to you with excellency of speech or wisdom you know Paul didn't want the people you know even though that Paul was a scholar was well Haidee want people to look at him as being a scholar he wanted them to see Jesus Christ he said I don't I don't know anything else but Jesus Christ and him crucified in Ohio in his resurrection that's the only thing I want you to see because you know a lot of people you know he could have come and spoke a lot of things that were enticing to people's ears and you know being a scholar there's a lot of things that would have been sounded great and thanks but you know that was one thing that he said I come in fear and trembling and weakness you know he came in a certain way that he wanted to speak to him because he wanted to see Jesus Christ and you know the thing is it is to see Jesus Christ in to know what he has and what he has said to us and it says here that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God so you know he wanted to come and he wanted them to see Jesus Christ but he wanted them to know what what the word had to say and let's look and see what the word has to say for us because that's what was given to us and he says there was a mystery here and he said it was speak it was spoken and he said it and say the world can't see that it's not it's not naturally discerned he said it takes the Spirit of God to find these things and you know if we don't stand we don't have the Spirit of God to to look at these things and you know we find many many things in the scripture that you know Paul talks about some things that program talk about but you know it took it takes a fivefold ministry you know it took it took something to bring these things out because you know it wasn't in love the world being able to discern these things when the world to be able to find them because he said if not he said they would have crucified Jesus but it wasn't but it wasn't for them to see those things but it's but it's for us and it's for us to me to realize that they're friendly given to us you know if we if we take things and you know if we realize that it's freely given to us you know it's not that we have to struggle and strive and try to obtain something though it's free if it's free then it's free you know brother Brent said it it's you know and he wants to give this to you more than you want it for yourself so if it's free then you know we're not having a struggle and strive to get it it wants to us whatever thing is is you've got to know how to get it you know just like he talks about the two groups of people he said you know one group knows how to write a check but they got no money in the bank and the other ones got money in the bank they don't know how to write a check but see the problem is that you've got to get them together he said if they know how to write a check cause the money's in the bank you know when brother Brent hopes about the story one of my favorite stories is the lady that didn't have any money in June if she was poor and she had to go to charity you know you know many people you know heard me tell the story many times but I just love that story is why they called it speaks to me you know and you know you know she was without but you know she had those what she thought was pretty pictures yeah she had pretty pictures and you know and they said well let me let's see those pictures and when she when he got her Bible she had those pictures in her mouth and when she opened him up in the hand him to her you know they were back drafts her son had sent her that money but she didn't know what she had and he said what lady in what light in the Bible what leg in the lids of her Bible was a real help to her but she didn't see that somebody had to come and show her what late in the lids of the bottom and you know many times we have people that you know well I can just get it myself you know brother they said rubber makes the foot one time people say well you know I don't have to go to church you know I can just live a good Christian life he said you can't you know if that if a fivefold ministry wasn't required then he wouldn't put it in the scripture to have they don't they never would have just fallen out of the sky and you know weather just stripped over it it just hit us all in the head but it didn't it takes it takes a person to come speak these things to us that land the lives of the Bible and how many times have we taken the Bible and we've read and read and listen to brother Brown same things and all of a sudden it takes a minister to come by and speak somebody speaks something to us and we see that and I can remember years ago brother Harold Hill Debrett preached to the message and he was on the masterpiece and not long before I heard brother Hill Brett preach I had read the book the masterpiece and I was sitting in it was a video that somebody had given me of him preaching and I was sitting him up in the basement listening and I was watching and brother Hilda bright started bringing things out of the masterpiece and I was like I didn't hear that so I finally stopped the take them and got the book and I brought it in there and he started reading things out of the masterpiece and you know what it and I was like well I read that I had to read that but something had to strike it that it was there I had read over it and all of a sudden brother Brett was saying that things have struck me and it was like wow that wasn't there and I didn't see that and you know rock wise because it's so important to have a fivefold ministry because you know we've seen people that have you know we've read things we've studied things but you don't want I've heard so many times people preach but you know what I thank God that we have a five fold ministry that we have a ministry that preaches the word and you know it takes the Holy Ghost it takes laying before the the word for it to conduct to life for them to see mate you know I'm Alma try to come we'll get a handle on himself and my notes here but brother Karen yes sir what the faith that we have from other religions out there back to what you mentioned earlier power demonstration of God and what separated brother Branham and why we know that God sent him it was power in demonstrate right and as you were mentioning not knowing that things are available for us we have a lot of teaching instruction and but putting it it into action is where the separation is going to take place and I still appreciate brother Ram the power of the spoken word but and how often do things come out of our lips that we aren't even aware of that were defeating power and demonstration in our lives I can't do that run my family we've always had this I have to go to the doctor because I gotta watch out for this how many times are we in fighting forces in our life that we can be free of rut and a part of the five hope is dish to share those things right to share how to be delivered from from even illnesses pains in our body right so I just appreciate how Paul said I can come like in that day and age I can come and teach right like Galileo my instructor did and I can do this that and the other but you'll be following uh maybe even a cunningly devised by religion to some sort offshoot of world we're called to be especially in this day and age power and demonstration and this morning I woke up again encouraged there's three three things that I believe the Lord's that being released in the earth right now one is truly his love to be able to flow through his bride another is boldness I want to speak the word I've been praying that X was a chapter or there were they pray boldness to sprits beat your word and to stretch forth your arm to heal and to see the signs and wonders take place in the site the other thing namely Jesus issue and then the third thing is a favor I've been I think favors being released I not sent away to never before then we can talk to people I mean the other day at the job site I had a whole group of people I was telling us experiences about supernatural things and another brother and I rented a book about and he said guys in her and to just been cussing like before that and one guy had talked about being in prison and that he go he went red well that was a sign to me if if there's anybody here that goes red and just gets in a fit of rage that's a that's a demon I mean that this plan is simple there they go they today I've learned that they run in games you have like murder will be on the end of anger and violence or what have you that those are actual spirits and they run in gangs and murder usually tagging along to try and manifest it so that's all the spiritual doing but looking for vessels to manifest them so so I shared with them you need there need to be deliverance in your life because there's a demon there that's trying to manifest itself and in it how do we know that we can be delivered of things or what we just say with us I'm Irish so if I'm gonna be angry there's no way I'm going there all of those rage is that just who I am and you don't don't burst yourself that's a double in the family line that we can take care of those soul ties to hold generational spirits that want to hang around weddings you know so anyway I think I didn't I just want to make people aware of exactly we're in a game because you know only thing about it is is when when you receive the spirit of the price when you have this when you have the Holy Spirit now he said he was a gentleman rubber emcees a gentleman but see the thing is is you gotta allow him to work because you hear the now are you going to act them because we can hinder The Weekender the work of God it's not that we don't have the word go where do we hinder the work of going because we hinder the work of God because of our own actions and their own words because what we speak because if we don't if we don't speak the word what he says whether we feel it or not we're the you know whether we don't see it or not if we speak what he says it comes to pass because our words are seats that were sewing so are we so when the word that God said are we so in the word that we think he said let every man's word be alive and might be true and he said brother M said that he's a high priest the Bible says he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and if we Berlin said if we don't confess to say the same thing he did he cannot act on that he's lonely he's available exactly he hates the high priest acts on what we prove what we can face now going back to what you were saying I was before the scripture that I was going to was Hosea 4 and in Hosea 4 you know Hosea brings to the brings to the people and if you if you go to Hosea verse 1 and you start reading the chapter and four time I'm not going we wouldn't go there today but you know when he starts bringing out when you when you start reading and home sale when he starts talking about what what was going on and how they lacked the word verse four says my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou has rejected knowledge I will also reject thee that thou shalt be no being no priest to me seeing thou has forgotten the law of thy God I will also forget that children now if you go back and start reading at verse 1 you'll find out that he talks about Indian and murder and all the different things that was going on and and the scripture even before verse full when you start reading he talks about them bringing complaints against one he said not Stryver contend against one another because God said that it was not the people see the people work tough to work and he said the problem was enough though people and he said don't bring it he said because it's the priests fault God said I'm bringing the accusation to the priests because the priests were the ones that didn't preach the word he said they not they y'all have failed to bring the work to the feet and then he says y'all stumble in the day and he said in the prophets felt in the night he said they both fall in the night he said what was it he said so the priest because they had gotten away from the word because they were too lags and too afraid to to have boldness to speak to the people and tell them what the truth was the people had gotten all mixed up they said they had because of the place and then the Bible says and blood touches blood the scripture tells us that it was it was they had murdering so often that one blood shed touched the other blood ship that's how much that's how much the the murdering was going on and what struck me was you know that's the way we are with our words we can edify somebody or we can destroy somebody and you know what there may not be bloodshed but you know by the words that you speak to somebody it's just the same brother Brent says if you if you say something against your brother and you cause someone to be offended by this said it's the same as murdering here if you kill somebody's influence you might as well just took a knife and stab him in the heart and that's what that's what he was that he was telling Hosea the Hosea was bringing to the people and what struck me is you know he didn't say my people are weak because the lack of knowledge they said my people are destroyed because of the lack of knowledge and he says because the priests didn't bring the word see that's the reason that it's important to have a fivefold ministry but see the thing is is it's we take on that responsibility because we are the ones that should labor in that it's it you know because you know everybody says well the fivefold mean you know they can to point fingers and oh you know but see the thing is is yeah you can always find one that's wrong you can always find one that's failed you know all the different things but you know what look at the ones you know because they I was speaking the other Wednesday night you know when Satan always brings things and it happened in your life and you see things that have happened and he says well you know what about this and what about that and this happened and that happened but you know what when when every devil inhales against you when every gun has been pointed at you when there is no way out and everybody has even people that don't even that are not Christians and yet they are the ones that have to testify that it was Almighty God to come on the scene and moved in that situation you know what you never find Satan bringing that back up and saying what about that right you know when when the three Hebrew children were in the fire when they were getting ready to be thrown in and they said listen said we don't care our God is more than able to deliver us but if he does not deliver us from this fire we still won't battle we'll still have the same testimony that we have when we go in yet but you know what when they went in God came on the scene and became visible among them that everybody else had to testify because when the King looked in he saw the four men standing under fire when those three boys came out they didn't have the smell of smoke on them they more singe they can have a sunburn did mess up their clothes right they didn't have anything and they come out of fire and you know what they had to testify that they'd sing God come on this it see in those situations anyone were surfing exactly exactly that's what's going on today we serve the same God takes the same yesterday today and forever you know brother Matt says in this is from the message if God be with us then where is all the miracles and spaces someone said to me one time I know the doctor was talking about a miracle that had to happen among a sick person he said to me preacher don't you believe if I told them people to go up and touch a tree or post the same thing would take place I said no sir that's it because you cannot have faith in touching a tree or a post faith is not that loose it's got to be based upon some note in fact you've got to know something about what you are having faith in because you can have faith in it so we first must know and what what God's desire is what God's plan is and how to approach God by that plan and then we can walk up boldly to the throne of grace complete what the plan is promised us so if we know so that's the reason that you have to be in the word to know what God has saved him and how to approach God you know many people that it's not that they don't have I had a preacher one time use that as an examples we go to hit one of those switches it's got a turn on right mm-hmm you have that simple faith it's going to come up it's that it's that it's that simple when we take God of this word and we know it's supposed to end if it's not happening in that way we call somebody and say hey why is it happening that way that's right or preacher use that one time for that perfect example knowing we having faith in something that we've experienced we've walked out or we've heard someone else walk out why can't I have that same thing where the word says I'm perfect whether you like it or not whether you see it or not that's not that's not as nothing to do with that word perfect is mature exactly sure sons and daughters in this day and age we've been given you said but say the thing is is you when you become mature when you grow up you're growing into the stature of Jesus Christ okay now the thing is is Jesus nothing Jesus not only was mature because he was God but he was perfect no when we look at the word perfect I mean what does that mean that means that there you're not not lacking anything he walked up with the father and son know everything that was there was was perfect what because it was exactly what the scripture said was when he come out he said you know showed me where I disbelieve the word amen where'd were this right here because the body was built by the Old Testament prophets they spoke the word and when came in so when he walked up there he was exactly what they see oh yeah so he was perfect in the fact that he was exactly what the word said it so not only are we growing in maturity because you know if you but if you receive the Spirit of Christ if you receive the new birth you are perfect in know there's still a growth that we have to come to into maturity but we're still perfect if because the thing is is if we're not if we're not perfect if we if we don't come to and you know and everybody just you know you know we're not perfect though you're not ever gonna have a problem it's not the perfection that you know you don't ever have singing but you know we have a blood that makes us perfect well your thoughts in right now exact everything is under the blood so that they end us and to say they still covering us today amen all the way up until the bodycheck Jonathan the scripture tells us is you know we don't know what we would be but we know that we'll be like him wheesht by cold will see him as he is so as we come to that place in we are reaching that perfection missing people as people will look to well I have this and I have it no you're perfect this thing that pest house is only working on that real us the perfection part so don't don't identify with this thing here this is only being used to perfect the character like you said abroad of our Messiah because there is the time well this will be made perfect yeah the same curse will be removed brother it says in God's chosen place of worship he says now notice in the aroma 16 he said worship in the place that I've chosen now you must worship God he said in the place that I've chosen not what someone else chose but what I have chosen now if God chose a place it behooves us then to find out what he said about it and where is it I want to find it and truly I want to worship he talks about the different denominations we are here to worship together takes it we're all seeking something he said I want to know truth the Bible said you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free somebody you can't know what you're doing you don't know how to do it until you know how to do it you don't know what to do until you know how to do it rather you must know what you're doing and how to do it this shows us that God has a meeting place for worship ours and one certain place in that place only God meets his worshipers so we must know the truth and the truth that set us free they said there's a way big God wants us to know how to do it and we got to know what we're doing and how to do it so we must know these things in the the definition of no ties a lot of lot of scriptures together but to no means to understand or perceive as a factor truth to apprehend clearly with certainty he says to have established or fixed in the mind or memory to be cognizant or aware of to understand from experience or attainment usually that says to be able to distinguish as one from another or deserve so when we know something when he says we must know these things we must be able to not only to understand perceive but discern these things because as a scripture says the spiritual Mendes earns spiritual things and the natural man deserves natural things and it has to be by the Spirit of God that we know these things that we can discern these things and in the scripture in 2nd Peter chapter 3 verse 1 says this second epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your remember about your pure Minds by way of remembrance and he may be mindful of the things which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us of us the apostles of the of the Lord and Savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the father's fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the Word of God the heavens were old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world was then was that was then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that the that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day so you know even you know as the scripture came forth and then he says that in the last days of big scholars that will cover he says I want you stir up your pure Minds in a way of remembrance of these things these things that you should know they said and the scoffers will come in the last days wanting to know where's the sign of his coming and he said you know they're speaking of these things and said you know things continue as they are but yet he said they're willingly are ignorant of the fact that the earth has already been destroyed say they've not even seen what's been taking place they said you'd be speaking to us to understand these things but we should know what the scripture has to say and I don't look it up I don't have I don't have it on the screen this morning but I just want to read a few scriptures I'm gonna kind of go through so and just kind of hit a few things but there's two there's two things that we know we've been looking at this morning and one of them is to know something and the and the other one don't look yet if we're where Peter says here not to be ignorant of something and you know there's a lot of scriptures throughout the Bible and oh the homecoming we don't have time to go through all of them but I just want to point out a few scriptures that we look and this is from then what the Apostles wrote that we can move and go through it and just look at some of them and listen to what listen to off of the Apostle Paul and John and therefore once right and then we're going to look at we'll look at some other ones but starting in Romans chapter 3 verse 19 and Paul says and we know that what things soever the law saith is saying itself to them under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God Romans 7:14 says for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin Romans 8:22 says for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now Romans 8:26 says likewise the Spirit helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray as before as we all but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered Romans 8:28 says for we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose 1st Corinthians 8:1 says now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we have that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth 1st corinthians 8:4 says that's concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no other god but woman 1st corinthians 13 verse 9 says for we know in part and prophesy in part verse 10 says but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away 2nd Corinthians 5:1 says for we know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens 1st Corinthians 5:16 says therefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more 1st Timothy 1 verse 8 says but we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully Hebrews 1030 says for we know that him for we know him that hath said vengeance belongeth unto me I will recompense saith the Lord and the go and again the Lord shall judge his people and at first John first John first - chapter 2 verse 3 says and hereby we do know that we know him if we can keep his commandments in verse 5 says but whosoever keepeth his word and him verily is the love of God perfected hereby know we that we are in him first John 2:18 says little children it is the last time as we have heard that anta that enterprise shall come even thou art of their many Antichrist whereby we know that it is the last time he says first Corinthians 3 - says beloved now we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we shall know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is first grant first job 3:14 says we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in them first John nothing I'm not reading all over that this just trying to get a few but first John chapter 5 the beginning of verse 15 he says and if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him and if any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto them he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death there is a death there's a sin unto death I do not say that he shall pray for it all right now all unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death we know that whosoever is born of God sin if not but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not and we know that we are of God in the whole world lieth in wickedness so there's more scriptures that work but that's what I was amazed at is how many times where the Apostles are right especially Paul where he says we know we know we know we know and then you go and then I will read all of them but here I just looked up in the Greek it's the inferences to be hidden from one something that they're unaware of herbs even secretly run from in the Hebrew they take the word know to know and they just put the knots next to it so you're not knowing I just thought that was so interesting how it's the same word for no but they just put the negative roman in the hebrew a''- yeah doc and i just went across the minister this week so it's interesting you this popped up that was talking about how God has laid out in our path thinks he wants us to find about himself and then we can share with others or however edifies us right he said it's like a two-year-old it media's mr. bone Easter eggs or whatever you sit around on the floor you want them the time to buy this this this this this gift or treasure right and then you said that when we pass on the other side God talks about on that mantle ages to come we're gonna continue to reveal to us his mercy his his his his manifold mercy there the scripture talks about right and I just thought how we're in this neat little journey on this side and God actually is laying things along our way that we're going to stumble on because we need to eventually written as we're becoming mature and learning we're gonna come into that place to eat wants us to eat before we get out of here then we get on the other side it's going to continue britta umpteen age is still revealing finding out about the one we're in love with yeah I just thought that was a neat encouragement to keep fighting this battle well anyway I didn't get to the scriptures Rick what Paul says that we should not be ignorant of the rete one of the personal s first Thessalonians 4 you know Paul says but I would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them that are asleep so there's different scriptures in there and we didn't wait to get to those but I've been expecting to get through all this this morning but so there's a lot to cover but you know there's lots of time for falseness I would not have you ignorant brother I would not have you and you know it's it's important you know because the scripture has word of a certain length and you know it's for us to know these things and that you know it's just one thing had come in when I was looking at this was Jesus said verily verily I say unto you rubber am said that man absolutely you know he was calling their attention to what he was saying in lots of times I think when when Paul was the Apostles are writing we know these things are not being there these things I think it's important for us to look at what they have to say the I think they're bringing us a point that you know that we need to look at be cognizant of ss you this morning [Music]
