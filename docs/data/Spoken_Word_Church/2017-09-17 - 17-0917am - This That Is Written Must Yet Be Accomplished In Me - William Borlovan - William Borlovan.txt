easy and they're little they're their pastors and gods their job is just as important right you know a new brother that get behind the pulpit because you know these brothers and things they're preaching the word they're here on on Sundays and on Wednesdays and things but then mothers and pastors are within little ones that congregation every single day every single day so pray God anoint you to live and portray that Spirit of Christ in front of your little ones because they're little sponges and then when they see the Spirit of Christ in us as parents and they wouldn't want to be like you because they'll make them want to be like Christ because they see him in you amen so we're selling a preacher grant again we want to greet you where the Matthew told me to especially greet everyone for him send his love and we just love and really appreciate you sharing the word with you you know brother Dale was just I love preaching here because they're establishing the word and it's easy it's easy preaching you can feel the pull and it's just a wonderful time the Lord we appreciate y'all so much so let's not keep you standing too much longer we'll get right in the word and let's we'll read in two places in Exodus chapter 29 is one spot here Exodus 29 and the second spot is gonna be Matthew chapter 4 but we'll read Exodus 29 first beginning here with the fourth verse and Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring into the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and shall wash them with water and that shall take the garments and put upon Aaron the coat and the robe of the ephod and the ephod and the breastplate and gird him with a curious girdle of the ephod and thou shalt put the mitre upon his head and put the holy crown upon the mitre and thou shalt take the anointing oil and pour it upon his head and anoint him amen in Matthew chapter 3 verse 13 then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him and John forbad him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comes down to me and Jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased amen let's go to him in prayer to count Heavenly Father we appreciate you so much we think you're gone for your word and your spirit Lord and we thank you for your truth we thank you Lord for all the saints here Lord and for bringing us together that Lord we can partake of that body Word of the Son of Man father Lord the carcass has been given us in time Lord and has called your Eagles together Lord we've come to be this morning Lord we pray you forgive us our sins may you just help a store to have the mind of Christ both to speak the word and to hear the word father with understanding that we may better serve you Lord and be a voice to this the last generation in Jesus Christ's name we pray ask all these things amen amen god bless yous you're seated I like to title this this morning.this that is written must yet be accomplished in me and I pray that as we go along I may refer back to some of last night's service as it's a background for what I plan on what the Lord has put upon my heart this morning so we find that in this setting here I read in the Old Testament where God has set forth in the law what the priests and what how they were supposed to carry out the service of the Lord and then we find that all that was to be done and natural because they were supposed to portray something throughout the Old Testament they were supposed to you know to bring that that lamb and to make their sacrifices because God was trying to get them to prepare them for the Lamb of God that he was going to sin and we saw that as it's common with flesh and blood things become common to people and they got toward just they just oh here we go again it's time to go up to Jerusalem to worship it's time to to do the sacrifice and it became a thing of routine to them and we must never let the word of God become a routine to us it must always be something fresh you must always be that yearning to go in and partake of the Lord so we find that when Jesus came he had he knew exactly he was the word so we knew that that as he came along he knew exactly what was supposed to be done he was led of the spirit to go to John to be baptized and John was absolutely correct in his assessment that Jesus not only did not need to be baptized because he was sinless but that Jesus should have been baptizing him because it was John that was born a sinner so it was it was John that needed to be baptized of Jesus but yet Jesus knew that John was correct in his assessment but he submitted himself to the word Jesus submitted himself to the Old Testament type because he knew he had to be a priest he knew he had to be a sacrifice so he submitted himself to his own word to fulfill the word and it's so important in this end time that we walk with a consciousness with with an standing to know why we do what we do because in the Old Testament and the Bible is it was coming along they did not know many times what they were doing or why they were doing what they were doing but there comes a time when we're going to get into it as we go along where when the fullness comes then there's a full understanding there should be a full understanding and revelation that comes with the fullness of the word but Jesus told John that suffer this to be so because it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness and we're taught that righteousness is the Word of God so in other words Jesus is telling John suffer baptized me because I've got a word to fulfill so you have to baptize me because if you don't baptize me that type in that shadow is not going to be fulfilled because I'm the sacrifice I'm the Lamb that's gonna give myself for the sins of the world so I've got to be washed I'm a priest I've got to be anointed and we see in our text there that when Jesus follow the word the Spirit came down upon him and led him right into the wilderness he was on a he was on a predestinated path to the cross and nothing was going to stop him not even his own his own desire there in the and in the Garden of Gethsemane when he was sweating the blood and the tears and the dread of he knew what he'd have to go through but he was four ordained and he knew he had to go all the way so nothing could keep that from happening in the message it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness brother Aaron says and in the wilderness you know who I am because God and the wilderness told you there would be a sign following me and you've already borne witness of it and you know it and we know who each other are we know each other think of that Jonathan whenever the blur came to the Prophet and brother Brian brings out that the word came to the Prophet in the water that's where the word came and that is where that first public vindication of the Prophet was was when he was baptizing in the Ohio River it came to the Prophet that same light the pillar of fire came down visible among five hundred or so people just says the pillar fire incarnate came to John the Baptist in front of all them people came to him in the water so he goes on he says we know each other and then it is true that you need to be baptized of me but let's suffer that to be so for John if we are the lights of this day we must fulfill all righteousness all God's Word must be fulfilled by us for this day for it is becoming to us as behaving it's becoming it's like us for we are the true witnesses of God today John we are the lights of this age and if we are the lights of this age there is so much scripture that's got to be fulfilled during this age and it's up to us it's up to us hallelujah it's up to us to see that all God's righteousness is fulfilled and remember righteousness is the word it's up to you to see that God's righteousness is fulfilled Jesus could not come and go to baptize them because that wasn't his part that was John's part G John came up to do his part and then he stopped Jesus and that's where Jesus picked up and did his part and then whenever Jesus fulfilled his part in the flesh then he sent down the Holy Ghost and the church picked up their parts it's remember it's God's Symphony you've got to know what part to play you cannot because if you that is the problem is you cannot impersonate or try and play the light of a word gone by if you try and do that that's denominational you can't do that you've got to do what God has called for you to do in this day so if he we know and so we must know and be conscious and that's why understanding and revelation is so powerful because you've got to know what's expected of you we've come to an age where it's not you're not just doing things like they did in the Old Testament not knowing what they were doing they were just doing it by commandment there were later the spirit to do so but there's come a time where you you were you've got to know why you do it you got to understand if we've come to that our Saints we've come to that our where we have to know what's expected of us because if God expects more of you than in any other age and he does we that we the pressures taken off because he's equipped us with the word that's not been given to any other age because what he requires he each of the equipment he goes on the light of every age should do the same thing we know what is to be fulfilled you who are spiritual and know the Word of God you see what God has promised now the word will not let it without the word will not just come easy but it comes by observation you got to press your way in to do it but yet it behoove with us it is becoming to us to fulfill all God's righteousness we must do it and that comes back to you is job's not just it's not just it don't just come easy it's not you know I believe it you know this was a message but this doing this does not make you a message believer putting it over your heart does not make you a message believer it's got to be in your heart that's where it's got to be now message believers Holy Ghost Phil message believers we'll carry it like this they'll carry it like this they may not they may not carry it publicly at all that's not what it's about but every born-again Christian carries the message there are a carrier of the message and I believe with all my heart that every born-again Christian you should be able to play every born-again Christian and hear the message you should hear the word you should be able to hear revelation you should be able to watch that life to play them and you watch the life of Christ in that individual because every life speaks there's a voice behind every single life and we live in a world of so many voices so many voices try and pull us this way in that way but above every voice in this world there's got to be the voice of God above every bit of it so with partial understanding comes partial reality if you only what you can only walk in the light that only that you know that's it and that's why the church age Saints that's why God when he served as a mediator in the church age to where they had that that's why the God gave Luther the baptism the Holy Ghost even though he preached in titles because he could only walk in the light that he had it wasn't time for that capstone yet you know if you do away in the Luther Age if you do away with these two and try and drop the capstone on there it's not gonna fit it wasn't time they had a partial understanding so they had the partial reality they couldn't take the body change they were expecting it because the book was still still there every age was preached to to expect the coming of the Lord and the God did that and his wisdom because if they knew they'd still be hundreds of years they would be relaxed but see now we've come and realized other the book has been open we've realized that now it really is the end we are the last age there's no age coming after us there's no messenger coming after us the only messenger coming and this here is Jesus Christ if you want to talk about an eighth messenger brother branham introduce Jesus Christ that's it you see Jesus Christ and his fullness it's him that transforms our bodies but there's nobody changed without a soul change it goes from the inside out Abraham had to believe God first and then it took change in the body that's how it always works you get you you get that healing that revelation and then your body will line right up to the word that you believe you speak the word you speak that positive faith my brother West's testimony you know where that brother said it'll be all right and it was he spoke that word and it caught it in faith in his body lined right up to it because if you already healed in the body then what's the point and hold on to anything you've already got it so it happens on the inside out and as brother Graham said how do we know the rapture is not going on all the time because remember the rapture is a revelation so as we get go from glory to glory from word to word and our lives are being changed our body's gonna catch up to it because our bodies are still falling our human spirit is still falling holy ghost still Christians have bad days Holy Ghost field Christians can lose their temper all the ghosts field Christians can say the wrong thing you see but you get up because that Spirit Christ did not come to redeem the spirit he redeems the soul and then everything else is gonna line up right to that soul that's why you start with the Holy Ghost first that is why just like a new Christian we teach our children Jesus Christ rose from the dead he rose up resurrection morning and they believe it and they believe it and that's how it should be but one day when they have their own experience they know it and that's how the message is you tell the kids a message is right the message is the truth God brother Ramzan vindicate a prophet but it takes their born-again experience for them to know that for themselves so in first corinthians 13:9 for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away you know and even our bodies it's not our souls are being perfected by by the Holy Ghost but our bodies aren't perfect yet so when that perfection that translation comes then all this humanistic realm is going to go away all this humanistic personality these rough edges or whatever it may be God's made everyone like that for a reason you know and it's many times to develop our own character whether it's with ourselves or develop someone else's character because the way we are so God knows what he's doing but you know when Abraham took Isaac on the hill and we know the type of how how Isaac had to carry his own wood his own cross and what it type Abraham was just following the commandment of God but yet you can think if you can go back all them thousands of years and see that how you could go and preach to Abraham how you could go and sin and then show him about and then preach to him thinking the end time bride could go back and preach to them patriarchs about what about when you took your son Isaac and it was going on the cross it was Jesus cry and then you can go on and show him whenever God changed you and promise you that seed he was that that's gonna be us and and that's what eternity is gonna be about when we can fellowship and you can talk to it you can talk to Abraham Isaac and all the father's here when David was weeping over Jerusalem when he was a rejected King he when Absalom came and took the kingdom and we know the story and things he was just it was just happenings in the lives of them Saints and it was portraying a spiritual truth in reality and David had a gat to go up on that mountain and look back on the city and cry as a rejected King he had to do it it was an event that had to happen in his life because because the great son of David has done that that's exactly what happened he was rejected so all these different examples of the Old Testament as they were just in part they would just portray Jesus Christ here they're portrayed the bright here they were to portray this this group and that group all in part and they had no idea and the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed his brother Ram says all those things typed him just in tight but yet the mystery was hid then men didn't know what they were doing they only knew they were led by the Spirit to do something now holding it back in the last days for the great revelation think of that he was holding it back all those you know you read of the Bible about David and you read the Bible about the heroes of faith and you we sometimes try and compare ourselves with him and and things but think that what God has done for you he's predestinated you to come in this end time when you can look through the life of Elijah through the Elijah through David through Noah and then he can actually see with understanding that they were just typing you that they were just in part or just a little bit of their life here a little bit of their life here it was building on up and then it became in his fullness in Jesus Christ they were portraying they were looking to Jesus Christ and then in the church ages brother Dale has started all over again you have the Alpha bride and then the church ages were coming on up they were coming on up and they were pointing to a fullness because this is like the Old Testament they were just all had little parts and they all had their part and they lived the word for their day and then the fullness comes just like the Old Testament little parts they were pointing to something and then the fullness came the husband and you know I was thinking whenever it takes to really be able to hear the voice of your husband and I'm talking spiritual you've got to be married to them first whenever you hear the Prophet on a tape when every one of these brothers get up and minister we're supposed to discern the voice of God behind the voice of that man and so if you take it back to the natural and if you're not if you're not married to a man then it's just another person it's just another man's voice but whenever you're married to a man then that's the voice of your husband and you recognize that voice it's that relation but before you really recognize the voice you've got to be married to them first if not it's just another voice it means nothing to you but when you hear the voice of your spouse it catches your attention it catches your attention because there's a relationship there and you can recognize that voice so before we can recognize really the voice of God we've got there's got to be a marriage union or it's just another voice or it's just another preacher or it's just another tape yeah that's that's just brother brands boy but when you're married when you've heard that bridegroom call then you say that's my husband's voice when the words coming across the pulpit that's the Holy Ghost that's not one of these brothers that's the Holy Ghost you're able to discern it because you hear the voice of your husband because there's been a marriage Union if not it's just words if you read a love letter someone else's love letter don't mean nothing to you but when your spouse writes a love letter you're a boyfriend your girlfriend there's a relationship you're gonna read it it's gonna mean something to you and you're gonna hold on to all them words so that's how it's got to be with us so to go on since by expressing to express himself in Moses and David and Joseph and Elijah and on down through you could take each one of those prophets and bring their lives out and show it expressed Jesus Christ perfectly exactly yet never giving his secret in full waiting for to make it known in the last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully disbelieved fully comprehended see before he could express it he was holding it back thinking how how should that make us feel Saints that he held that he predestinated us to this end time to show himself in fullness and absolute fullness to just open the book and his lay it before you because you've got to take a body change and if you fail you have to answer for it because there'll be no excuse the book has been open it was been playing to you it's been preached to you you've had it in your homes there'll be no excuse so what kind of people should we be so John the Baptist when Jesus came to him let's make our way over to st. John chapter 1 whenever Jesus came to him John knew what part he was to play Jesus came through the womb of a virgin because it was written of him to do that it was the time for him to be manifested through a virgin now that word is fulfilled now he's not going to make himself manifested through a virgin anymore that words done so now he promised to make himself manifest through a bride that second fold mystery grab brother Dale there's three fold first was through Jesus Christ he done that he gave now the Holy Ghost and it's that second fold being revealed in his church that's what he's accomplishing now that's the plan of the hour so John knew his place in the scripture because he was questioning fun st. John 1:15 John bare witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I speak he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and of his fullness we have all received in grace for grace that histone con grace grace John introduced not just the part of Jesus he introduced all of Jesus for the law was given by Moses but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ no man has seen God at any time the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father he hath declared him and this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who are thou so the people are coming to John they know that something is going on they know that this is something different they haven't had a prophet for four hundred years and all of a sudden a man comes you know wrapped in in sheepskin and and eaten honey and wild locust and and and preaching marriage and divorce and just laying the acts of the root of the tree and preaching serpent seed called them their their father the devil you snakes in the grass he was preaching the word and he wasn't cutting him no slack so they they had figure that there must be something about this man in the scripture where where is he identified right this is this is something so they come and they ask him what you are thou art thou a prophet he answered no no he said in asking and what then art thou Elijah and he said I am NOT art thou that prophet and he said no it's interesting because asked him art thou Elijah and he said no brother I'm said I'm not a prophet but he came John the Baptist within the spirit of empower of Elijah so he goes on he says then they said to him who aren't though that we may give an answer to them that sent us what says thou of thyself now watch John go right in the scripture and identify himself with the word he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord as saith the prophet Isaiah so he didn't say I am the one that a virgin said that would be conceived he found his place in the scripture he found that he was the voice that was crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord when they came to Jesus I want to know about what authority he didn't say I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness that was John jesus knew what he had to do and John knew what he had to do so when John seemed Jesus come he knew that was the climax of his ministry he knew that all that preaching he did all that baptizing he did when this man came to him he knew he could introduce Jesus Christ to the world right he knew he could introduce Jesus Christ to his generation because he knew what part of the scripture belonged to John he knew what part of the scripture belonged to him and then when Jesus comes along he walked right in the order of the word he walked right in the sink of that symphony Jesus knew exactly what was written oh and that is vital in this our Saints it is vital to know what is written of you that is what gives you authority over the devil that is what gives you authority over any kind of false doctrine or false idea of things because remember there's many voices in the land today but no one where you stand brother Branham preached that very well-known sermon this day the scripture is fulfilled in your ears and we see that how how the spirit even worked it to actually replay the drama exactly how it happened in the days of Jesus how that won't how that brother Adam had that brand-new Bible no no the story and the pages are stuck together and it had to be that way so that Roman Catholic priest had to be on platform to give brother branham that his Bible because it was a repetition of the scripture so we see that Jesus when he was able to open up the scripture and open up that family album and go right to where his spot was and he knew where to start and he knew where to stop because it's just as important to know where to start as it is to know where to stop because going too far is just as wrong is not going far enough right it's like praising God for what he's gonna do and like what he did you got to just you got to know we praise God for all that but you've got to know what he's doing now and that's what separates a real Christian we don't look to to to the resurrection just as some kind of historical fact it's a present tense it means something for you today on September the 17th it means something for you today it you should be your life she'll be testifying of that resurrection so in Isaiah 61 whenever they gave Jesus to scroll he didn't go to just Genesis or he didn't go to Noah he went right to what was written of him that spirit led him right to the work because remember Jesus just like God believed his own word they say who was the first believer God was he believed his own work so Jesus believed the word and he subjected himself to the word and that proved it in our text when he went to the river and let a man baptize God let a man baptize him so that he could fulfill the word that's how he subjects himself to the word so he reads Jesus reads these very words the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings it to the meat he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord stop he stopped when he stopped he rolled up that scroll and he gave it back to the priest Jesus knew where to stop and I was publishing with a brother Bob the other day and we were talking there's a whenever you read that sentence to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord there's a comma in that single comma and this just shows you the infinite amount of God and we're living in that comma right now in that comma is the seven Church ages in that comma is brother Aaron's ministry in that comma is the calling out of the bride in that comma is the rapture it's all just one little comma that the Spirit did just like that behind a word that stopping point that's the entire Gentile dispensation right there just in a comma he stopped because Jesus knew where to stop we don't go and try and call out 144,000 the bride knows words stop the bride knows we're not over there trying to get people through - speaking in tongues for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the bride knows where to come pass the bride's past that the bride is past a clothesline religion the bride is past that it's a shaming it still has to be preached but the bride is past that God didn't send a prophet for clothes like he did to get the bride straight but he didn't open the book so that we know how to dress he didn't do that God didn't keep something sealed for six thousand years he did that to keep he he he brother and preached that hardliner they hard that clothesline religion - at first to get the attention to get the people right because God won't even hear your prayer if your heads uncovered right he had to teach the men how to act and how to treat their wives and how to run their household that's that's the ABCs you know I'll her brother I'm on tape you know he said how you oh you've got to how can I teach algebra unless you learn the ABCs so people are still around ABCs how are they ever going to learn a body change how are they ever gonna get revelation for body change when they don't when when they don't even know how to love one another brother Brahim tells a story and he said your ABCs has always believed Christ and he told the story about that one minister that was walking by and he passed by an alley and there was a little boy there praying and the little boy didn't know how to pray so he just sang his alphabet abcdefg and going through and so that minister asked them what are you doing here and he said that he didn't know how to pray and he just said his alphabet and he knew God would put it together you know and what that reminds me of is this message is simple it's just that the carnal mind is people trying to partake of the word trying to partake of it of that bread of that manna that was left in that holy place without being anointed to do so without either being called without having the Holy Ghost or you know that manna is for every born-again Christian it's not just for the ministry it's for every born-again Christian man woman boy and girl needs to be in that holy place in that relationship to be able to go in there and God make himself known to you but that ABCs what it reminds me of is the simplicity of the gospel how it's the ABC but it takes God to be able to put them ABCs together to be able to paint a picture for you to be able to take a word here to take a word here and to display Jesus Christ among you because brother Graham preached the seven seals and he opened the seven seals but to get a lot of the mysteries you've got to dig in forward and backward and that's why I believe God put this message on software and all these things so that we can search it through so that we can make our calling an election sure it's common and he saved it for this endtime so we'll be without an excuse but Jesus knew where to stop listen to this quote out of the Easter seal now as the promised Messiah he quickened every word that was prophesied that he would do heal the sick and now he'd be born of a virgin all that made it is true he was the word manifested here on earth but he could not do this just as a man it taken the Spirit of God dwelling in him to quicken these promises to him think about it he said I hope that we can get this real clear now Jesus being a man himself the body but it took the spirit in him the spirit it's not me that doeth the works it's the father that dwelleth in me he's the one that does the work see Jesus himself was the word because he was before God this is a bad word to use and I hope he could take you right before a crowd but he was predestinated by the foreknowledge of God how God's plan was to be that he would send a redeemer and this redeemer could be his own son so then this was God's promise all the way from the Garden of Eden that Jesus would be here and he was he was a man as a man born of a virgin but it taken the Spirit of God to quicken that word to him and he was the word quickened the word quickened for that hour the time had come that she had to have a redeemer the law had failed other things have failed now it takes a redeemer and he was the promised Redeemer he was quickened by the Word of God so if we if somebody would be looking for a redeemer now they've missed it he's already come you see if somebody's looking for Malachi 4:5 they've missed it he's come see how important it is to be spot on the word so when Jesus would read the Old Testament he would read the stories of the Old Testament and be able to see the word by hey be able to see the prophecy behind the story so he would take events and and you can run around call himself a topologist and it's a very scriptural thing because jesus was a typology he'd read the stories of the Old Testament and then bring them over in his day and stand in authority and proclaimed the in authority based on a story about prophecy out of the Old Testament he superimposed it would be a word and here's the definition of superimposed it means to place or lay one thing over another typically so that both are still evident that's a superimposed means you take an event from a long time ago and you lay it right over the very day an hour that we're living in and you see it it's exactly it's another way of saying is history repeats itself that's like superimposing so whenever Jesus read the story of Jonah for example he read the story of Jonah and he read that Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights so he being God being the word quicken he realized that Jonah had to be in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights because his experience was a prophecy of Jesus being in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights so Jesus read the story of Jonah said that's me so then he was able after reading the story of Jonah and that's what Matthew records Jesus saying for as Jonas was in the was three days and three nights in the whales belly so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth so Jesus reads the story of Jonah and comes and stands before his generation and said that within you you know you destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up why was he able to say that because of Jonah think about it the authority that Jesus had to say such a statement was because Jonah was in the belly of the whale so that was quickened to him that that was talking about him so he was able with authority to say destroy this temple raise up in three days because Jonah couldn't be in the bed of the world for two days Jonah had to stay in there for three days I imagine Jonah repented within five minutes of being in Wells Valley but God said no not yet you got to stay there for three days and three nights because I'm coming in flesh in so many hundreds of years or whatever and I've got to be in the belly of the of the earth for three days and three nights so you've got to stay in the well for three days and three nights because you're prophesied about me you see so Jesus was able to read that he was able to read the story of Noah he was able to read the condition of the days of Noah and then be able to say as it was in the days of Noah superimpose it so shall it be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man he was able to go dig up him Old Testament Scriptures because he knew his place in his hour and was able to prophesy he was able to prophesy from Old Testament that's why stories are not stories that's what stories are prophecies stories you know that there's a story we were fellowship and recently about the the sister that was poor and she kept her son was sinner than pretty pictures and she kept them pretty pictures in her Bible so she was rich but didn't know it she was living below her means that they had called the the you know the state or somebody to try and take care of her and they had where the room tells us a story that she had the money she kept it in her Bible and God sent and you can type this in different ways but God sent some men to her or God sent a prophet to her God sent the five-fold to her to speak the speak what the prophet has already spoken and he they begin to show her that she was rich and begin to explain to her that actually these aren't you this ain't just pretty pictures this ain't just a pretty story this isn't just a bedtime story you tell your kids this is prophecy so we must pay attention to the stories think of what profound meaning the Eagle story has to us today think of the profound you know story meaning all a lot of them stories so you see that people that have that have left the message they get hung up oh brother Ram said this in a story and it wasn't quite right I just held on so much of them stories there was no revelation there it's not just stories it speaks a spiritual application it speaks a spiritual truth but a person's got to have a year to hear let's go to Luke chapter 22 and Luke 22 and even the Gospels is full of what Jesus did that this and that may be fulfilled whenever he seen the money changers in the temple he got infuriated and plated them ropes and beat him out because it was written that he would do that so let's begin with verse 35 and he said unto them when I sent you without purse and script and shoes lacking anything and they said nothing then he said unto them but now he that hath the purse let him take it and likewise his script and he that hath no sword let him sell His garment and buy one for I say unto you that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me and that's where I get the title of this from this that is written must yet be accomplished so he not only knew what he was to accomplish name but he knew what was in the future so look what's after that comma he was reckoned among the transgressors for the things concerning me have an end so there's things that have been written of you that have yet to be accomplished so there's a comma there so you don't have to be you're not either it wasn't written of you to be reckoned among the transgressors and to be beaten and to be and to be crucified that part was a written of you so after that comments thee is this that is written must yet be accomplished in me and that's the testimony of the bride in our mind she started thinking about the resurrection just start thinking about the translation because it's been written of you so you can see what God has brought you through and how he's showed you of himself and showed you his word and yet you can still have a testimony of this that's written that has been accomplished in me this is being accomplished and that will be but I know that that scripture pertains to me so then you can stand with boldness as Jesus did and say this that is written is to be accomplished in me we're gonna be changed we're gonna be translated because it's been written and it's not just me there's a lot written that don't necessarily apply to us right now you see that's the difference it's got to be this that is written is yet to be accomplished in me and you bring it down personal Malakoff pour you're not malachi for I'm not Malachi for brother Branham was Malachi for so you see that in in Revelations 10 and 7 then you have revelations pick up with revelations 10 8 to 11 that's the bride this that is written is being accomplished in us the bride's got something to say the bride is speaking it's prophesying so how does the bright you say how does a bride prophesy by saying what's already been said you prophets that when you say there's going to be a resurrection you're prophesying it's already been written whenever we preach and as we as we preach the message whenever you hear the message when you witness about the message when you witness about Jesus Christ you're prophesied it's already been written it's already been spoken but when you say California is going under your prophets on right so this that is written so behind that comma you can put this that is written is yet to be accomplished in me behold that show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed that which is written he's yet to be accomplished in you in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed that that is written is yet to be accomplished tonight that should be your testimony you know it's in there and then you can stand with boldness just that the same boldness Jesus that Jesus was barricaded by the word he couldn't raise before that time because Joe and I couldn't come out of the West see it's all connected Jonah can't come out of the well before three days because Jesus couldn't come out of the earth before that Jesus couldn't come out of the earth before that time because Jonah didn't come out of the belly of the well during that time Jesus is barricaded by scripture he was barricaded by that comma he couldn't quite be he couldn't he couldn't come to to do the day of vengeance he was barricaded by that scripture because Gentile bride had to be called he subject to his own word that is why when we pray when we when we when we we bring the word back to the Lord Lord you promised you promised that that you know that I can apply the token to my family you promised that my children would be saved you promised that I would be healed here it is before you and he's got he's as subject to his own word you know we can say something and then change our mind we're all human and we make mistakes but God doesn't do that he says that he's got to keep his word there's only one thing God can't do we always talk about what he can do and he can do anything but he cannot lie he cannot go back on his word so when this corruptible try to put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory Oh death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ he knew what was written of him and in also in Luke 18:31 then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we go to Jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished whenever he went to Jerusalem he knew he knew what our faced in the Garden of Gethsemane he knew what our he had come to that's why he was sweating blood and tears blood and sweat the water was separating his veins he knew that he said if it be possible let this cup pass but he knew what he was called to do he was thinking of you he was thinking of you he was thinking of every every attribute that he had in him while he liked that song says while he was on the cross I was on his mind so the prophets wrote that he would come they've been preaching it for thousands of years that he was coming there to portray in their lives and now the prophets have also written that you would come the prophets wrote John wrote that there would be a bride without spot and wrinkle it's already been written so can you identify yourself with that Scripture can you testify that that which is written is being accomplished in to me he's he's earning out my wrinkles he's washing my spots away by the Holy Ghost by that river of life that's flowing out it's being accomplished because he promised it so you had that confidence you stand on the word if you don't have that confidence if that Holy Ghost is not in you to give you that confidence then it is mixed with doubt it's mixed with frustration you are a slave to your emotions you're a slave to how you feel when your feet hit the floor you're a slave to how you feel when somebody cuts you off in traffic and that ruins your day when you're when you get you know your boss may mistreat you on the job you're a slave to your emotions and that's why this world is in such a mess because they act on their emotions in every level to act on their emotions but that see the Christian has that anchor and when our emotions may get out of hand there's an anchor to yank it right back a Holy Ghost filled Christian doesn't feel saved every day the human emotion does not feel saved every day but when you open your Bible and you see what is written of you then that anchor that that soul gets you and you realize I don't care how I feel just like you don't feel you may not feel healed but you are because His Word said you may not feel saved every day when you're in the VAT David didn't feel like a king when he was rejected he was over there crying Lord how could this have happened to me my own son but in God's eyes he was the king when David was the youngest in a family and God anointed him King from his childhood he might he didn't feel very kingly when his brothers was constantly trying to get rid of him and he you know he might have constantly you know he might have gotten in trouble the next day he might have gotten punished by his dad the next day for something he didn't feel very kingly in his emotions but he had to know what was that anointing oil was on him you may not always feel like you're worthy to be Brian nobody's worthy to be the bride but it's not what we did it's what he did in the message things that are to be he said now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creed's we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride brother Aaron said it is the manifestation of this hour the bride the manifestation of this hour the first pole a second pole didn't by itself produce a bride it was to catch the attention but that third pole is the only one that third time that third pole that gets that rainbow trout that's what that's what gets the bride not a creed or denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the bride best to be expressed in this hour that we're now living you know some people may think that when you talk so much about a bride that you're taking away from brother branham you or not you are complementing the brand because that was his mission on earth was to forerun the coming word you know and in fellowship we talked a lot about it is just as important you know to not put brother branham where he doesn't go as it is to put him where he doesn't go everything has its place you know and we know and understand that the purpose of the ministry is relevant says it lays it very clearly in the church age book that God calls me and has been faithfully taught and then they preached the message they preach the word but everything that ever comes across this pulpit any pulpit in an acclaimed message church to be able to be taken back to the Bible and the message so there's no reason to be afraid you know in our daily lives we should be sowing that word in our hearts then come to church and get it confirmed come to church and get it you get it get it really enthused share with one another this is exactly what I was just reading this is exactly what I would just heard the brother Branham say it works together you know in second Corinthians that talks Paul talks about how some say there of Apollo's and some say of Paul Paul says already not babes you know he said Paul he said I planted in Apollo's watered but God gave the increase and what a brother ram teaches that the planting was at teaching rain that former rain that came down and he planted and God called God called men to preach the word in water a little brother and said here look what the Bible says here see how perfect the message is see how it is Jesus Christ the same it makes it undeniable if you're really honest with yourself the purpose of the ministry is to make the message and the Bible come together like a woven like that curtain and make it undeniable so that on the day of judgment you won't have an excuse in your face undeniable and then if you disbelieve it's your it's your thing it's your choice make it in your face plain so Jesus knew it had to come to pass it's good let's read John 19 real fast at his crucifixion John 19 26 when Jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing about whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour the disciple took her into his own home now listen to verse 28 after this Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled he saith I thirst he couldn't say our thirst until all of them other scriptures were fulfilled that's what the Bible says here Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished there's still some scripture that had to be fulfilled so then it was time for him to say I thirst all that's been done I thirst and every bit of his crucifixion every every as it is you really study the progression of the crucifixion it was a constant scripture fulfillment of Scripture all the way down he couldn't die till he saved that thief he couldn't that scripture had to be fulfilled he was number he couldn't have been crucified by himself he had to be numbered with the transgressors he had to be there with him thieves Judas had to come remember other in God Jesus came from heaven to take one Judas came from Hell and took the other thief memory say there were two crosses Jesus was on one Judas hung himself on the other so we found that after his crucifixion we found that on the day of Pentecost we see that the early church did exact same thing Jesus did and I want us to notice that really only the fullness can do that only the fullness whenever it comes up in his fullness Jesus could then look back through the entire Bible and pick up what was written of him all the parts and show that it was himself right when that alpha bride came on the scene of the day of Pentecost we find them doing the same thing we found Peter saying things like this is you know this is that which was written we found Philip going up to the eunuch when he unit did not have understanding about what he was reading he thought maybe he was the Isaiah was talking about himself that out of the member of the Alpha bride was able to go there and say and preach the word to him and open up the word to his own who he was speaking of and I only said that you know he not only preached to the eunuch as a way of future Philip realized that Jesus was a fulfillment of that scripture and was able to say it was not John the Baptist it's not me it's not Paul this Jesus Christ this this is the fulfillment he's a fulfillment of that scripture so you have Paul did it whenever he came and he preached he was able to go back and he was able to pull out all kinds of types and shadows about they all came with Moses under the cloud they all came he had to preach Jesus Christ out of nothing but the Old Testament so he had the fullness of the word to be able to go in there and preach Jesus Christ - to Jews that held on so tight to the law and he had a priest Jesus Christ with nothing but the Old Testament but do you know you can do that too now you can do that too but it that's because the his fulness has come that's it that's the only reason because when that fullness has come that partiality understanding is done away with and the fullness they but it look back through the whole Bible say this is me this is me this is me this is this this is that but only fullness can do that only when Jesus Christ can was he able to pick out all the different instances in the Bible and Paul did the same thing and now this Omega bride brother Ram did the same thing you see how they all went back to the Bible brother and went back to Abraham and Sarah and pulled out by the Holy Ghost how they were changed that's reading a love letter yeah it's not spelled out for you in the Bible that's reading a love letter right there that's here in the voice of your husband and the woman after well and with with Jeremiah's with the captivity of Israel being a Babylon for 70 years and brother my a beluga doubt about that type in the seven churches being down in captivity and the bride is supposed to take ten points and be able to run run with it through the scriptures because brother Branham hit the high points and you can and that I can show you a string of quotes where brother Graham talked about his constraint of time but did you take home and you study it you open your Bible you open your Bible on the chloral the evening he preaches say and in prayer he said Lord I don't have you know you the elect caught it I pray that your spirit will reveal to them what was meant but you got to be married to him first that's why it takes the Holy Ghost so the brothers there's a continuation of that continuity the same continuity that we see the paul had a same continuity that brother Branham had the bride's in that step because remember when brother Aaron had a vision of the bride the bride was in step of the gospel and I believe that the bride is in the step of the message that he brought it God used him to bring the gospel that gospel step and we know when he got out up whenever they she started getting out of line that voice cried out to get back in line so just as the Holy Ghost as we're talking last night how the Holy Ghost is evidence of his resurrection the fact that if you're a born-again Christian you have the Holy Ghost that proves that he rose from the dead even though you didn't see it it's proven to you okay that fact it just like the revelation and the word that's been given to us in this endtime proves to us that the books been open it proves to us that the seven seals have been open because of the understanding that God has given us if the book would still be sealed we'd still be a church age our understanding would still be partial we still be teaching in parse we still had this hanging here and that hang in here and we may on a personal level but God knows how to iron write that out and lead us straight but I'm talking as the church as a bride as an overall the truth has been given to us the truth has been fully disclosed we can't wait on we're not waiting on brother Branham to come back and reveal anything because if he's still got to reveal something for a body change then what are we doing and in the message marriage of the lamb brother and said they had the material on earth now to make themselves ready that's what we're supposed to be doing now is making ourselves ready by the time we see brother Branham it's gonna be over with for the Gentiles it's gonna be over with because that hijacks your faith whenever you say he's got to come back and give us something else that's like saying every part of this guy Evers every part of this word is true but this part mark 16 with this part that hijacks your faith that throws the whole thing off you begin to doubt well is this part did the scholars purposely add that of their own selves you got to have the faith that it's all true so there's promised to be a translation after the fullness has been revealed it can only be a translation after fullness now we know that there's been an types it has been you know Elijah went up and Enoch and things but as a group of people which still won't be much still won't be meaning program said but the perfect faith in a perfect rapture are connected and the quote perfect faith brother Ram said the Word made flesh hallelujah the word operating in human flesh by physical signs by material signs by Scripture signs perfectly to bring you a perfect faith for a perfect rapture so for the wage you can't have the perfect wraps or without having the perfect word you can't because if that was the case and the Lord could have come right here in the middle but he couldn't he was holding it back for this in time so now that he's equipped you with perfect faith now that perfect rapture can come but not until that perfect faith had come Jesus had perfect faith he had it come because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word as you receive the word and once you really you catch it and you understand it and you can raise up so much that you can even get the Holy Ghost right when one of these brothers are preaching while Peter yet spake these words whether it's wet while brother Brandon preach these words the word is it's that the word has got to be preached so as a word is preached somebody can say that's for me and get the Holy Ghost without an emotion right where they're sitting that's the word in power that is the word of power and demonstration that comes with the preaching of the word but if you're preaching falls baptism the Holy Ghost can't quick anybody he says now watch now and he said to us if you abide in me and my word and you st. John here you can ask what you will and it'll be done then recognize your position in the scripture as a believer see you've got to recognize your position as he recognized his position you're not testifying that you've got to be in the belly of something for three days during the heart of the earth or in this and that because that wasn't spoke for you that was Jesus's word that he stood on and that word is true but now you've got to work to stand on you see you've got to bring your personal you got to bring it home so let's talk about Enoch we know that Enoch walked perfect before the Lord so I want to put a little background because brother I'm said Enoch knew that he was a type and he knew that before the floods came he had a given example in the days of Enoch just before the flood when Enoch looked out there and saw Noah building away on that ark Enoch was a prophet Enoch knew that he was a type and he knew that before the floods came that he had given example so one afternoon it was becoming to him to take a walk it was becoming that he'd take this walk with God and somehow that day he changed his path instead of going around the side of the hill he took the Kings Highway and he just kept on walking and they found him not because he was not but he'd walked up on the Kings Highway and in Hebrews 11 by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death she was by faith and faith is a revelation so by revelation Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him now listen to this sentence right here for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God right so before your translated you've got to be pleasing the Lord that was Enoch testimony he pleased God before his translation and he was translated because he pleased God so that leads the question of how do I please God it's found in the next verse but without faith it is impossible to please him if you have no revelation it's impossible to please God Cain couldn't please God because he had a revelation look how Abel please God brother baa Abel pleased God with his revelation for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him remember Jesus Christ on the Mount Transfiguration he had the testimony that he pleased God and so much the voice came down said this is my well-beloved son and whom I'm pleased to dwell in hear ye him he was pleased with Jesus Christ and now with that in mind listen to this quote out of the church age book brother Branham said I know that works if a man fears that he might not please God then let him fulfill the word if a man wonders if he'll hear those words well done good and faithful servant let him fulfill the word of God in his life and assuredly he'll hear those words of praise the word of truth was a criterion then it is a criteria now there isn't another standard that isn't another plumb line as a world is going to be judged by one Christ Jesus even so it is going to be judged by the word if a man wants to know how he is making out let him do as James suggested look into the mirror of God's Word so if we begin to question Lord my me doing this by me making this action by me wanting to marry this person but me having this desire of my life am i pleasing you they said look in the mirror of God's Word is it in the word that's what we must do but we must please him before we translate and with the only way to please him the Prophet said is fulfil the Word of God and how can you fulfill the Word of God when you don't know what you got to fulfill you cannot fulfill the word if you're walking in ignorance whatever is ignorant to you and you're not sure of that's not faith you cannot walk in that but when it's all opened up before you you can see the lights on in this church and I can see exactly how to walk out if it was dark and there's obstacles and I don't know I only have to stick to whatever light I could get but God there's a man here that can turn on the light and he's turn on the light in this antenna there Brian knows how to walk and get around this this obstacle this obstacle this false doctrine go around this way because she's on a journey so we're trying to bring it to a landing spot but let's think about God wrote three Bibles there's three Bibles amen there's one in the stars he wrote one in the pyramid and this Bible that we carry around today there's three Bibles and the amazing thing about it is that one lines up with the other when God first wrote the Bible in the heavens he threw he throw out the stars in the constellations and Enoch by revelation was able to look at them stars and he had the fullness of the word and with that fullness he was able to build a pyramid and that pyramid lines up with the Stars they're still marveling about it today that second Bible lines up so perfectly with another one but that pyramid just like the constellation that pyramid is still a sealed mystery to a lot of people they can't figure out the pharaohs were buried in it they did this with her they thought you know that they all kinds of things they have their own ideas but Enoch sealed the mystery of God in that pyramid and after he expressed the fullness because even so much that he didn't even put the cap on it right so he expressed that fullness in that pyramid and then got to come home he had the revelation of fullness please God with that revelation of the fullness and God took him home but see Enoch had that test when he built the pyramids it's it's so it's so marvelous that even the prophets of the Bible bring in that pyramid language and we'll read some scriptures about the stone that the builders rejected the prophets are talking about the pyramid then brother Ram comes and he lays this out in the pyramid form and it brings up the capstone it brings out the church ages type in the pyramid brings out the new city that's gonna come down all as a pyramid and Enoch had that revelation all the thousand years ago so see how a fullness equals translation it took the the fullness in Enoch the fullness that God gave to Enoch he caught that revelation and with that revelation after he preached so to speak his revelation to his generation that pyramid even those might have been in a sealed form God took him I fear at that please God so much in Ephesians 2:20 the apostles are still bringing out the pyramid talk and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord in whom ye also builded together foreign habitation of God through the spirit and pyramid means fire in the middle and that's what it is is God's habitation in you and then Peter picks up on it and preaches the Statue of a perfect man and the stone that the builders rejected has become the very hitch stone the corner still preaching about the pyramids preaching about the constellation about the stars job and things talking about the stars it's still preached about and people still scratch their heads about the stars they still scratch their heads about in the pyramids and they still scratch their heads about this it's all three Bibles people are all confused about they've got to twist in all kinds of astrology and they got it twisted the pyramid you know with that all-seeing eye on the new world order they twist a twist of Scripture and make the nominations out of it it's always twisted but when you get the correct revelation of it all three Bibles line up because it's supposed to go from heaven in a start on earth in the pyramid and from here by the Holy Ghost is supposed to go in flesh god condescending down praise Lord God condescending down from heaven to earth and you and back to glory and back to earth to live with him forever so you have the first two thousand years Enoch was changed changed and translated by the revelation that he had before the great tribulation of the flood so to speak as a tire before the flood came Enoch disclosed his revelation and God changed him and took him home second 2000 years Jesus God came down himself in flesh the word made flesh he was the keystone of the Bible the Word made flesh that fullness the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelling in them he displayed the fullness he done his work as a redeemer he done his work to the souls that were in prison he done what was written of him and then he rose from the dead he took the Old Testament Saints with him and he was gone see the fullness and translation Enoch had the fullness and then he was translated Jesus was the fullness and then he was translated traveler like a thought so what have we come back to again two thousand years later Saints 2,000 years later the full revelation has come through the mouthpiece of a vindicated prophet to fully disclose the word to a bride for what for translation Enoch Jesus and now you have the in time bride because we're at the second crucifixion of the Son of Man at Geo Jesus Christ so then you've got the two Jews it doesn't stop there you've got after the brides gone you got Moses and light she goes back and calls 144,000 and discloses the fullness to the Jews and they get the Holy Ghost and then the two prophets are killed then they're resurrected and 144,000 and guess what another translation that's why God sent a fullness you've got a fullness and a translation that's why got us in a fullness so we can be translated if you want to write through scriptures down about the two prophets of revelations eleven three to twelve and then also first Corinthians 15 12 to 26 but Jesus was the capstone of the Old Testament until the resurrection of the Old Testament Saints and now he's also the capstone of the New Testament he comes down and Carnot's himself think about that he incarnates himself in a multi-member bride members of his body and no matter how little you think that what you do is just so little insignificant but it's not insignificant to God how many of you have ever had a hangnail and things hurt so bad and they're so tiny so when one little thing gets out of order it can disrupt the whole body everybody what you do is so important to the Lord the important thing is being his will if it's his will for you to do something if it's his will for you you know whether it's to preach or to clean the church or whether it's to help out to cook it fellowships to leave songs to take up the offering it's all in the service for the body and you're all in your position so in the old testament brother i'm said in the room in the message the rapture the Old Testament Saints has gone had has gone into his presence and paradise paradise done away and the Old Testament Saints ascended up at his loud voice when he screamed and gave up the ghost because why the sacrifice the propitiation of their sins they had been they had waited on believing that the perfect lamb was coming that offered the sacrifice to lamb and when he died and yielded up the ghost he screamed with a loud voice and the Old Testament Saint to Oak Brother and says watched the shout and the voice over here the same thing at his coming because remember we're at the second crucifixion of the Son of Man he goes on and says yielded up the ghost and when he did the sacrifice was perfect and paradise emptied out and the Old Testament Saints came to the earth again walked round on earth and entered in with him at his rapture and what does revelation 10-7 say in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God would be finished and when Jesus said it is finished what followed a resurrection and then a translation the same thing happening but it only came at the fullness in Ephesians 5:14 it says wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead in Christ shall give thee light brother Branham brings out in the church age book how they're not dead but they're sleeping among the dead so the voice of the bridegroom calls out and tells him to wake up and to come out of her my people because he's calling out a bride there's got to be a translation it's been typed out on the Bible and we're able with eyes of the Holy Ghost to look in the scripture and see the types and the shadows you see the revelation that God had given them and then what followed enoch when he built that pyramid he built it to perfection every stone had its place every stone was honed down as it came on up the you know the stones at the top were not as big as it stones on the bottom it was honed to perfection and they say when they when he built the pyramids that originally had a really like a white limestone or something that was just so perfectly because you hear brother Graham talk about you could put a razor between the edge and had a limestone I think the French for Napoleon of somebody or different civilizations went and stripped it off over time but God allowed that pyramid to still stand as a memorial right all these thousands of years it's so important Saints in closing that we understand exactly what's written of us and that we know what to expect and that we know where we're at where we've been and that we not impersonate a light from another day it's got to be current faith and that's what real Christianity is it's not impersonating something it's not you know it's brother Graham even talked about people even back then that try to carry their Bible like Billy Graham they try to walk like Billy Graham they try to act like what was a simple Aimee McPherson of things try to dress like her that's not what it's about you know having a had a brother branham does not make you spiritual that's neat but it's not spirit it doesn't make you spiritual is what I'm trying to say Robin physical elbows of the Prophet did not does not give anyone the Holy Ghost he had his own flesh and blood that came out of the same room he did that were Catholics that had no idea about any that want Christians this isn't natural Saints it's spiritual why did brother Ram come to the realization of that he's not the son of Charles and Ella Brandon right every believer must come to a point in their lives where I'm actually God allowed me to come through the family I came in for a reason but that's not who my real parents are he predestinated you at a certain time to come in the earth to express the voice of God for your generation or to be given a chance at it and he's given you that opportunity but you have to come to realization that God is your father that you come from him so if you come from him you've got to go back to him because he promised that my word will not come back to me void when he sends that word and the earth is gonna accomplish exactly what he said it would do it's not gonna come back to him void he said heaven and earth will pass away but my work I never pass away right so when he here word think flesh and blood that word has got to come off the pages of this Bible Laurie and I know that y'all preached that here it's got to come off the pages of the word the tapes have got to come off the shelf and into you into me the natural tapes and the natural pages of this Bible is gonna burn but the word that gets in you is gonna take you out of here that is your ticket out of here brother Graham said and the flashing red lights of his coming that the Train is in the block it's time to throw the peanuts down and get on the train you say peanuts yeah they're the little things that's hindering you from you walking where you should be with the Lord that's peanuts circumstances relationships that's keeping you maybe a boyfriend or girlfriend that you shouldn't really be having but it's keeping you from walking like you should walk that's peanuts get right with God and if they're predestinated they'll get right with God and he'll work it all out but you got to drop them peanuts you've got to drop the complexes you got to drop the preconceived notions and god help us is and I don't know why I'm saying this but God help us as children of God to not look at one another god help us as children of God to not look and be and be kind of put back or put off but maybe one another's personality but look brother instead look at that person's intentions he called he said his discernment of spirit look at the intentions of that person right so God help us this morning to tell you as we read the word in our private time or at church and hear the word to really identify with the word to really take it for ourselves and to not just try and put it all on brother branham try and put it all on brother Dale on anybody on your pastor you've got to take responsibility for the word you've got to take responsibility for your actions you got to take responsibility for how you live according to the revelation that's been given we've got to have understanding revelation that God just whispers his love letter to us and love letter love letter does not mean that she can't find in the scripture you've got to find it in the scripture you've got to find it in the message it's not just some passing thought some mystic thing it's got to be in the world but it's the love letter is the difference between Abraham Mary Sarah they had a son of their old age a bracero died had Isaac Rebecca and then oh they were changed back young again they had to be young before they could have a son before Sarah could take that long journey to career but with a keen desire Sarah she'd I mean she was young and beautiful see that's the difference between love letter and just reading the letter there's a quote already but this last quote I'm sorry and then we'll close it's actually from yesterday you know he sit here about the letter vs. revelation he said and it was the same in the Old Testament but Paul being well trained and knew the Scriptures by the word a lot of people know this message by the word they can quote it to you but you see the Scriptures no matter how well you know them if the Spirit doesn't quicken them and when the spirit quickens that letter then it becomes life then it becomes substance then it's not Alcoholics Anonymous anymore it's God delivered you from it and you don't have the problem with it that's the difference the spirit giveth life see it must be quickened or made alive by the spirit if the Spirit doesn't live in the word and make it a reality to you then the letter is just intellectual that's where we have so many confessed Christians today or professed Christians is that intellectual conception of Christ you know Shipman's one of the brothers yesterday and talking about how the word has always got to come to the mind first it starts intellectually it's okay it starts there but when it dropped from here to here then we're talking something brother and even talked about when a woman wants a baby and she can't have one he said let her adopt a little puppy let her have that little puppy for a while and just take that pressure off and before she knows it she could be a mother so not to liken the word to a puppy but just so you understand take that temporary take it in your mind meditate in it and then even though you've got it in your mind it's okay to be honest and say God I believe this but I know I don't understand it like I should make it real to me and when it drops that what I call the longest foot from here to here when it drops down then you've got power then you have authority then living the word it's everyday life to you but when it's just here it's just a struggle it's a battle you go to work you get pulled on by the world you come home you're under better influence it's just in and out in and out but let it just drop let the word drop into your heart and you'll never be the same again so god help us this morning let's just bow our heads dear most gracious Heavenly Father Lord God we're so grateful thankful to you Lord for your spirit in your word we thank you Lord God that you would love us enough Lord to come and share yourself with us Lord it's not about just knowing some intellectual discourse Lord but truly knowing you and the power of your resurrection where we can speak the word brother Graham talked about Lord though there's a people come and that'll speak the word and it'll flash like lightning Lord we've got to come in that speaking condition Lord you know all things and you know how you're molding us and you're shaping us Lord as individuals and as churches father Lord all the word that's been sowed in his father all these years and this church or in any church we might have attend and the tapes father's been sowed in us all these years Lord and now there's gonna come a day where we're gonna ask to give a reason Lord if we don't get this word in us it's got to be in a slore we've got to be that written epistle Lord made Lord read and known of all men has got to take flesh Lord that word was of that word was written of you Lord that a virgin shall conceive but then when it became flesh then it became a reality then it became father God it became manifested as your prophet said it became light and when something is manifested there's no you can't doubt it anymore we cannot doubt at Lord and we believe found that you've been made manifest for us in this last time you've made a way for us to escape the Great Tribulation Period Lawyer and how thankful we are O God that you would count us worthy father gone to escape it Lord that you come and and take us out of here father we love you we thank you for the saints your

we're talking the real death that eternal separation from God god forbid that anyone Lord here would see that second death Lord Oh God Lord would just pray that you just take the words that were

Lord just become the traditions of man Lord and we're not following the traditions of man we're not following no kind of cuddly cunningly devised fables lore but this is the truth this is reality to us Lord well we just pray O God that you meet each and every need meet with us Lord give us what we have need of Lord and we know and Lord maybe we even have need of something we may not be conscious
