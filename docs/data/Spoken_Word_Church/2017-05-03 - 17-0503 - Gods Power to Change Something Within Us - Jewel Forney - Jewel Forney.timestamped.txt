[7:58] John says as many as received him to
[8:02] them he gave he power to become the sons
[8:06] of God and look at that already you know
[8:09] it's impossible to become a son of God

[52:31] that Missouri days like your final
[52:33] screen to say RZ p p ZZ but off all is
[52:37] easy or off that ended up in a cornfield
[52:39] I way I did Missouri in a cornfield and
[52:45] I'm sitting there thinking to myself I
[52:47] know I shouldn't be here I'm looking
[52:50] around my wife didn't know what to do
[52:52] when you have no GPS at that to happen
[52:53] as years ago I said the thing well I
[52:56] know we're gonna die from home because I

[53:54] that whatever same way you treat God
[53:55] people the way you treat God people is
[53:58] the way you treat God how did you will
[54:00] lose your reward

[54:03] went it's somebody offering him a cup of
[54:05] water he took it he would
[54:07] not doing it you he done it because the
[54:09] scriptures say if you give a cup of

[54:13] why really your reward honey so we got a
[54:15] do you know that what that is just ready
[54:17] but I don't know ever there as a lord if
[54:20] I ever meet him again he got to die this

[55:51] go attitudes everywhere you go
[55:54] there'll be no real love in this world I
[55:56] sons of your lower right now honey so
[56:00] you don't know what a devil fighter not
[56:02] it by the attitudes all the time we go
[56:05] to church attitudes I mean it's so easy
[56:09] good attitude people now preaching on
[56:11] this in everything I've been to don't
[56:13] believe me I some time I thinking should
[56:15] I preach this
[56:18] so many miners you get Johnny man man
[56:22] man see like you know I mean you saw a
[56:24] preacher those humble you need we got to
[56:26] do it cancer by yourself are you trying
[56:29] to hold the right attitude but let me
[56:31] tell you why attitude is so important
[56:33] the brother God used a quotation to
[56:38] remember this message was he says no
[56:42] matter how much i pray and lay day and
[56:47] night studying and praying before the
[56:50] lord walked down here maybe the
[56:53] anointing is on me and walk up her and i
[56:56] feel resentment attitude husband wife
[57:02] got in fight before church because she
[57:05] probably took all the time he ready to
[57:06] go she said how look i don't care how
[57:08] you look let's go see he's he's he's
[57:12] just it just grieved him away resentment
[57:16] in the service resentment would stop the
[57:21] move of the Spirit you know people don't
[57:24] know is so that's what we got to come
[57:27] with an attitude lord I want you to
[57:31] speak to me tonight let my attitude be
[57:34] right cuz I've got a need that I need to
[57:36] be answered the Lord
[57:37] but if resentment is in a service might
[57:41] not even I are you my header right out
[57:43] but somebody coming to church with a bad
[57:46] attitude I don't want to be you need to
[57:49] go back outside so Lord take this from
[57:52] me you know it's easier to it's easier
[57:54] to get it and it work as a human being
[57:56] it's easier to be that way it's easy to
[57:59] get attitude but as we give up over to
[58:02] God heal helpless in the words in the
[58:05] words you know anyway I don't want to be
[58:06] a double minded man the butter so double
[58:08] minded man is unstable and that mean
[58:10] that he's a he's a double minded man
[58:14] according to book of Jane 180 essay he
[58:16] emotionally and mentally unhealthy holla
[58:20] we don't work either
[58:21] he in other words he's emotionally in
[58:24] the words he you know where he he's not
[58:26] like it is not secure he's likely to
[58:30] fall

[58:38] say but if you don't know you save I can
[58:41] tell you that I can't tell you if you
[58:43] got the Holy Ghost aside sob you to know
[58:45] but I did what I could tell about your
