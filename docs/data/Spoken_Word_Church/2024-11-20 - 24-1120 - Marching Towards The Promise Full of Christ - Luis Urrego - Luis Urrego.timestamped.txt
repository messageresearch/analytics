[7:39] in amen praise the Lord Jesus what a
[7:42] wonderful evening to come and talk about
[7:44] the word of God Amen praise the Lord
[7:47] thank God for his word and thank God
[7:49] that we still have the Liberty to hear
[7:50] and and read and speak and talk about
[7:52] his word amen that's a wonderful
[7:55] privilege in this hour amen um let's
[7:59] just go to the word this evening we want
[8:01] to turn to Joshua chapter 1 Joshua
[8:03] chapter 1 it's one of my favorite
[8:06] scriptures and uh so
[8:12] let's let's let's go there I I want to
[8:15] talk about this this evening marching
[8:17] marching towards the promise full of
[8:20] Christ
[8:23] amen and I believe in this hour
[8:26] saints that it's more important
[8:29] especially in the day and time that
[8:31] we're living in more important to be
[8:33] feeding on the word of God more than
[8:35] ever right amen uh uh in in in the day
[8:40] and hour that we're living in so much so
[8:42] much uncertainty and so so many things
[8:45] happening but yet we have we can stand
[8:47] on something amen that's true amen amen
[8:50] something that that that that has um
[8:53] that will never change because God said
[8:55] my the world will change amen presidents
[8:59] will will change and and the things of
[9:02] of this world will change but God's word
[9:04] never changes amen and sometimes Saints
[9:07] if we could just really have that to be
[9:09] a revelation to us amen amen and to
[9:12] realize that what the word of God says
[9:14] and what is written there was made
[9:17] specifically and written just for you to
[9:19] help you in the hour that you are living
[9:21] in and when we don't want to listen to
[9:24] that word or obey that word amen then we
[9:28] it's basically kind of like we're we're
[9:30] we're be we're becoming our own Pope to
[9:32] ourselves because what the pope does is
[9:36] is is he is instead of God so whatever
[9:39] he says amen that that that goes above
[9:42] what what what God says you see because
[9:46] he is God here in on on on Earth so
[9:49] that's what Satan wants you to be God
[9:52] here on Earth but without the authority
[9:55] of the word of God in your life he wants
[9:57] you to be your own Pope that's right
[9:59] amen so that's that's something that we
[10:02] have to look at in this hour and just be
[10:04] careful of so let's just uh let's let's
[10:07] let's let's pray before we read the word
[10:09] Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord
[10:12] once again for the opportunity that we
[10:13] have to open back the pages of your word

[12:29] Christ's name amen amen amen Joshua
[12:32] chapter 1 verse 1 it says now after the
[12:36] death of Moses the servant of the Lord
[12:39] it came to pass that the Lord spake unto
[12:41] Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister
[12:44] saying Moses my servant is dead now
[12:47] therefore arise go over this Jordan thou
[12:52] and all this people unto the land which
[12:54] I do give to them even to the children
[12:56] of Israel every place that the soul of
[12:59] your foot shall tread upon that have I
[13:02] given unto you as I said unto Moses amen
[13:06] and from the Wilderness and this Lebanon
[13:08] even unto the Great River the river
[13:10] Euphrates all the land of the Hittites
[13:12] and all and unto the great sea toward
[13:15] the going down of the sun shall be your
[13:17] Coast H verse five and then you can be
[13:20] seated there shall not any man be able
[13:22] to stand before thee all the days of thy
[13:25] life amen praise God what a promise
[13:28] right amen not even the Gates of Hell
[13:30] will prevail amen praise the Lord as I
[13:34] was with Moses so I will be with thee I
[13:38] will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[13:41] praise the Lord you may be seated this
[13:42] hour
[13:44] amen amen what a what a great thing Amen
[13:48] to know that we have a god of certainty
[13:50] in this hour amen amen praise the Lord
[13:53] and as as we see here you know God gave
[13:57] God gave Joshua the Commandment to go
[13:59] over the Jordan amen we know that the
[14:01] promise was given to the children of
[14:03] Israel amen even back even back when uh
[14:06] it was given to to Abraham that they
[14:10] will they would they would take a a land
[14:13] amen and that God was going to give them
[14:14] a land amen that that that belonged to
[14:17] them amen why why did it belong to them
[14:19] because God said so am right amen and so
[14:23] that promise was handed down down to
[14:26] Moses and handed down to the different
[14:28] ones amen and and the children of Israel
[14:30] were looking for that promise to be
[14:32] fulfilled amen and it had to be
[14:34] fulfilled In God's Time amen praise God
[14:37] sometimes we could push and pull and and
[14:39] and and and think if we do this or if we
[14:41] do that or this ain't happening because
[14:43] this is happening but really amen it
[14:46] takes God it's in God's time when things
[14:48] are fulfilled amen praise the Lord
[14:50] sometimes we think we do have a part in
[14:53] it for sure but then there's also it the
[14:55] time of God Amen cuz God has everything
[14:58] predestinated in his own time amen
[15:00] praise the Lord Jesus you came in amen
[15:02] into this word amen In God's Time amen
[15:05] you couldn't come in any sooner and you
[15:07] couldn't come any later you came in at
[15:09] the right time amen praise God and there
[15:12] was nothing else that nothing that you
[15:13] could do or nothing extra that you could
[15:16] have done no more extra belief in his
[15:19] word you came in exactly at the time
[15:22] amen prescribed by God praise the Lord
[15:25] Jesus didn't come he came exactly at the
[15:27] right time amen the the the prophecy was
[15:31] given to to uh to Isaiah amen that a
[15:34] virgin shall conceive and that word had
[15:37] to come down through all the different
[15:39] women at that time all the different
[15:42] teenagers at that time that thousands
[15:45] and millions probably of of girls that
[15:48] happened between the time that Isaiah
[15:50] gave the prophecy Amen to the time that
[15:52] Mary came on the scene but it had to be
[15:56] amen exactly to Mary praise the Lord in
[15:59] order for that prophecy to be fulfilled
[16:01] amen and so I believe saints that in the
[16:03] hour that we're living in amen we are
[16:06] here because God ordained it for it to
[16:07] be that way amen praise God we couldn't
[16:10] have gone in a Rapture previously and in
[16:12] another last year or or 10 years ago or
[16:15] 50 years ago amen you are here amen
[16:18] because you have a part to fulfill in
[16:20] this hour amen you've got a word to
[16:22] fulfill in this word praise God Almighty
[16:24] and God's not going to leave here until
[16:26] every jot every ttle everything that you
[16:29] were bent to to fulfill is fulfilled in
[16:31] this hour amen praise God nothing more
[16:35] nothing less God won't have it any other
[16:37] way praise God you are here to fulfill
[16:40] that exact part hallelujah amen and so
[16:43] This Promise was given to the children
[16:45] of Israel amen back in the uh uh uh to
[16:49] to Abraham and and it was passed down
[16:52] and here's the children of Israel and
[16:54] and now it's time for them to come to
[16:56] this point where they're getting ready
[16:58] to take this land land amen praise God I
[17:00] believe in this hour that we're living
[17:02] in we're getting ready to take our land
[17:04] amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen we
[17:07] see the signs amen Pharaoh is on the
[17:10] scene right amen and and and and he's
[17:14] putting in his laws he's doing all these
[17:16] things and he's doing it very slightly
[17:18] too he is amen don't you think that the
[17:21] Democrats and and and and and and that
[17:23] they were the they were Satan incarnate
[17:26] amen you better believe amen that Satan
[17:28] incarnate it comes very
[17:30] deceiving very close to the truth amen
[17:34] amen Trump Bibles and all kinds of
[17:36] things amen very close that's what's
[17:39] going to deceive amen the Bible says
[17:42] that in this day and the hour that we're
[17:43] living in amen Jesus said that there
[17:45] will be there will be calling out peace
[17:47] peace peace amen and that's what they're
[17:50] calling Trump the the the the the I mean
[17:53] up to the point where even the Jews are
[17:54] calling him the Messiah I've got quotes
[17:57] where there some of those rabbis calling
[17:58] him the Messiah people here in in the in
[18:02] Christianity in denominations calling
[18:04] him the son of man calling him that's
[18:07] bunch of blasphemy yeah bud and we're
[18:09] just hooray y Trump won and he and he's
[18:13] taking it all in you better be careful
[18:16] better be careful and you better know
[18:18] where you're standing amen amen I I I I
[18:21] say these things about Trump because
[18:23] people are caught up with this amen more
[18:26] than the word of God do you not know
[18:28] what the word of God says Amen brother
[18:32] the word of God says that it'll deceive
[18:35] the very elected if it was
[18:37] possible amen so that means that it's
[18:41] going to deceive some
[18:43] people amen but it won't deceive the
[18:45] very elected praise God so you better be
[18:48] careful amen don't get caught up with
[18:51] all this Trump stuff I'm telling you I'm
[18:53] telling you he is he is leading people
[18:55] towards somewhere where you don't want
[18:57] to you're mark my words and you don't
[19:01] you'll think I'm a crank right now but
[19:02] you mark my words give it about two more
[19:05] years Y and you'll
[19:08] see I saw the Trump thing a long time
[19:12] ago you better believe that he's got
[19:14] something he's got something for y'all
[19:17] if you don't if if you're not hankered
[19:19] in the word of God praise God all right
[19:22] let's get back to this all right I don't
[19:24] know how I got into that it's the the
[19:27] the thing is Saints is that we're living
[19:28] in in in in a dangerous hour amen the
[19:32] hour that we're living in is so
[19:33] dangerous so deceiving we are living in
[19:36] the age of the pale horse rider that's
[19:38] right brother where everything is gray
[19:41] you don't know exactly what's right
[19:43] what's wrong what's good what's bad amen
[19:47] so you must be standing firm on
[19:50] something praise God the children of
[19:52] Israel were standing on that promise
[19:54] that God had given Abraham amen that God
[19:57] was going to give us a land
[19:59] amen and they had to look amen at Joshua
[20:02] who was a type of the holy spirit in
[20:04] that hour amen Joshua meaning Jesus
[20:07] praise God that's what the name means
[20:09] amen and Jesus is the word amen praise
[20:12] the Lord Jesus amen amen and so the
[20:15] children of Israel had to look at that
[20:17] promise in order for that promise amen
[20:19] had to in order for that had to look
[20:21] towards Joshua amen who was the leader
[20:23] of that hour in order for that promise
[20:25] to be fulfilled Amen to get to the point
[20:28] to say whatever you say Joshua that we
[20:31] will do amen amen because we see that
[20:34] later later on in chapter 3 I believe it
[20:37] is that's what Joshua that's what the
[20:39] children of Israel told uh told Joshua
[20:41] whatever you say Joshua that we will do
[20:44] why because Joshua had the word of the
[20:46] hour amen and God has given us a word of
[20:49] the hour in this hour amen for us to go
[20:53] astray in other ways and in other
[20:55] directions amen God has given us a sure
[20:58] word in this hour praise God the message
[21:00] of the hour amen it goes along with the
[21:04] word praise the Lord
[21:08] exactly it has to amen amen amen if it's
[21:11] a if it's the message praise the Lord
[21:13] amen amen so here's the children of
[21:15] Israel and at that point and so God
[21:18] gives them this tells them to go over
[21:21] this Jordan amen thou and all this
[21:24] people it's a commandment unto the land
[21:25] which I do give them even to the
[21:27] children of Israel every place that the
[21:29] soul of your foot shall tread upon
[21:32] Hallelujah that have I given unto you as
[21:35] I said unto Moses amen so he tells them
[21:38] amen as I said unto Moses praise God and
[21:41] what a what a wonderful thing it is to
[21:43] know that every promise Amen in the book
[21:45] is yours amen everything that God said
[21:48] amen if every promise that he gave is
[21:51] for you if you take it amen and put it
[21:53] into action amen have faith and believe
[21:56] that promise put it into action you
[21:58] watch it coming to pass hallelujah amen
[22:01] repent be baptized in the name of the
[22:03] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[22:04] your sins and you shall receive the gift
[22:07] of the Holy Ghost we'll never stop
[22:09] talking about water baptism we'll never
[22:11] stop talking about repentance because
[22:13] it's in the word and people need it
[22:16] Hallelujah I need to repent amen every
[22:20] day praise
[22:21] God we have we have people that still
[22:24] that that still uh that that still need
[22:27] to be baptized amen and we will just
[22:29] continue to preach that amen because
[22:31] it's part of the word hallelujah amen
[22:35] don't think that you oh well I knew all
[22:37] that already 50 years ago amen but but
[22:41] that that that's just skim milk and
[22:43] that's that's just amen that's in the
[22:46] word amen that's what got you to the
[22:49] point where you are at amen so somebody
[22:52] somebody else needs that same word amen
[22:54] so that they have the opportunity to get
[22:56] to where you are now amen praise the
[22:58] Lord so we will continue preaching those
[23:01] things amen because they're part of the
[23:02] word so every place that the soul of
[23:04] your foot shall tread upon that have I
[23:06] given unto you as I said unto Moses from
[23:08] the Wilderness and the Lebanon even unto
[23:10] the Great River the the river Euphrates
[23:13] all the land of the Hittites and unto
[23:14] the great sea toward the going down of
[23:16] the sun shall be your Coast there shall
[23:19] not amen there shall not any be able to
[23:22] stand before thee all the days of thy
[23:25] life amen praise the Lord you know we're
[23:27] going to have we're going to have
[23:29] adversary we have an adversary in this
[23:31] hour We're going to have Satan Satan's
[23:34] brother BR said that Satan's got a Punch
[23:35] coming to you every he's studied you
[23:38] ever since you were a little a little
[23:40] kid right right when you come out of
[23:42] that mother's womb he's been studying

[23:56] amen and those are the areas in our life
[23:59] that we need to keep covered amen praise
[24:01] God don't
[24:03] feel and I guess this is an

[33:38] of the law shall not depart out of thy
[33:40] mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein
[33:43] day and night amen now now that's that's
[33:46] where I kind of get the little thought
[33:48] about amen uh marching towards the
[33:51] promise amen full of Christ because in
[33:54] the hour that we're living in Saints we
[33:55] must eat this word of God like we never
[33:58] eaten it before exactly amen you know
[34:02] Saints uh I thank God for times times
[34:05] like these you know amen I thank God for
[34:08] for uh uh trials and
[34:11] tribulations in your life because that
[34:13] lets you look more into the word of
[34:16] God because that lets you know that you
[34:19] have no control of your own of your own
[34:22] everything in your life you might think
[34:24] you do amen and you might think that
[34:26] things are going a certain direction and
[34:29] and and then things all of a sudden come
[34:30] to a halt and you realize you know what
[34:33] I need more of God am there's no other
[34:36] way I need I need more of his word and
[34:38] so he tells God tells uh Joshua here
[34:42] this book of the law shall not depart
[34:45] out of thy mouth in other words you keep
[34:48] feeding on this word amen amen keep
[34:51] eating this word am amen how many
[34:53] stopped eating uh since uh since
[34:55] Thanksgiving of last year
[35:00] I don't see anybody that looks anorexic
[35:03] or anything like that you know you guys
[35:06] all look very nice and healthy robust
[35:10] amen why you kept
[35:12] eating right you didn't stop eating oh
[35:16] you were still eating the same mashed
[35:17] potatoes and the same cornbread and and
[35:20] the same turkey and you you're going to
[35:21] eat the same turkey that you ate last
[35:23] year it's the same turkey with dressing
[35:26] same things that we ate last uh Sunday
[35:28] we ate more than likely last last year
[35:32] but but you kept eating amen why because
[35:35] eating keeps you
[35:36] alive right eating keeps you amen gives
[35:40] you energy Amen to move forward amen
[35:43] amen don't stop eating this word keep it
[35:46] in your mouth amen this book of the law
[35:49] shall not depart out of thy mouth but
[35:51] Thou shalt meditate amen therein day and
[35:54] night amen praise God and it's not not
[35:57] just about eating it amen but meditating
[36:00] upon it as well amen meditating when
[36:03] you're meditating you know there's a a
[36:05] big movements about meditation and and
[36:08] and and all that all that stuff and and
[36:11] all that stuff comes from all those
[36:12] religions back in the Hinduism and all
[36:15] those things so be careful with with
[36:17] with those things because those things
[36:18] open up doors to Devils if you're not
[36:20] careful and meditation and things like
[36:22] that but there is a true meditation in
[36:25] the word of God and let think on these
[36:27] things amen think on these things that
[36:30] God said in his word amen and then try
[36:33] to see hey where am I failing the word
[36:36] amen in this and let me see if I can uh
[36:38] I can change my life amen according to
[36:41] what I have read amen but you over there
[36:43] practicing uh different uh Indian
[36:46] religions and and all that kind of stuff
[36:48] and thinking you know meditation and all
[36:50] that kind of stuff you're opening
[36:51] yourself to Devils so be careful with
[36:54] that CU some people use that to meditate
[36:58] as if it's something good just be
[36:59] careful with that amen but Thou shalt
[37:02] meditate therein day and night that thou
[37:05] mayest observe to do according to all
[37:07] that is written therein all that is
[37:09] written therein amen not just a little
[37:11] bit of it not just 25% of it God's not
[37:14] not pleased with just 25% of his word
[37:17] being fulfilled in your life amen he
[37:18] wants all of it amen he wants you to
[37:21] give him a everything that that he knows
[37:23] that you can give him amen praise
[37:25] through his word to do according to to
[37:27] all that is written there for then Thou
[37:29] shalt make thy way prosperous and then
[37:32] Thou shalt
[37:34] have
[37:38] success good
[37:40] success my what's better than
[37:43] success good success amen ain't that
[37:46] right Mercy that's good success is
[37:48] better than success amen and so we want
[37:52] good success in this hour amen and you
[37:55] know they they ask Jesus you know and
[37:57] they said good Master you know how how
[38:00] and he said why call me good there was
[38:02] only only good but God and so you can
[38:04] only get good success with a good God in
[38:08] your life amen there's no good success
[38:11] outside of a good God in your life amen
[38:14] don't you try to put and substitute
[38:16] anything else in there amen you won't
[38:18] get good success you might get success
[38:21] but you won't get good success amen it's
[38:24] it's good amen to know amen that that
[38:27] that you can you can have a good
[38:29] business you can you can be making good
[38:31] money you can have it amen but you're
[38:34] doing everything amen according to God's
[38:36] word amen you can you can have these
[38:40] things in your life amen but you know
[38:42] that you're walking amen and you're not
[38:44] letting uh your business rule rule your
[38:47] life you come to church on Sundays you
[38:49] you you you stay on top amen of think
[38:52] you you are in obedience and you're on
[38:54] top of the word amen because the word
[38:56] has become you're number one thing in
[38:58] your life amen I I believe that will
[39:01] create good
[39:02] success
[39:04] amen majority of the people now only
[39:06] have success but that success will will
[39:09] will you know whatever whatever these
[39:12] people have amounted to their life amen
[39:14] it will all die off brother you know
[39:18] your riches and whatever you've
[39:20] accumulated in your life amen but if
[39:22] your ultimate and your number one
[39:24] priority is God those things will perish
[39:27] amen but you still have god with
[39:30] you you're still taking god with you
[39:33] Elon Musk ain't taking god with him even
[39:35] though he says he says I believe in
[39:37] Jesus Christ and all that kind of stuff
[39:40] uh I like what brother Wade said you
[39:41] know Trump says he's a Christian and if
[39:44] he's a Christian then you're the
[39:47] Pope I don't believe that no Trump says
[39:51] that he he he says out of his own mouth
[39:53] he says I I don't need to
[39:55] repent says what do I need to I Tred to
[39:57] live a good life so that I don't repent
[39:59] is what he
[40:01] said though I Paul said I Die
[40:05] daily and he was the church age
[40:07] messenger that we still talk about in
[40:09] this day amen who changed and saved many
[40:13] lives amen praise the Lord and he said
[40:16] brother brandom need to repent every day
[40:20] amen why because they know it's not
[40:21] about them amen they knew it was about
[40:24] the Lord Jesus Christ amen they knew
[40:26] they they they they answered to a higher
[40:29] a higher person than they themselves
[40:31] amen praise God and so and so we need to
[40:35] realize amen that that when we we feel
[40:39] like well I I don't need to listen to
[40:41] what brother so and so says all he all
[40:43] he's up there he's just monologuing and
[40:45] and uh amen you need to see if it's in
[40:48] the word of God or not because if it's
[40:50] in the word of God and it's hitting you
[40:53] amen exactly where it needs to be it
[40:55] needs to hit you and yet you don't want
[40:57] to change even though the word of God
[40:59] says you're becoming your own Pope
[41:01] brother
[41:02] amen that means you are over the word
[41:06] amen amen you know and as as us
[41:10] preachers amen we preach generally amen
[41:13] I don't know anything about anybody's
[41:15] life I don't I don't want to know I try
[41:17] to not
[41:19] know I just you know but if something
[41:23] hits amen praise God then it needed to
[41:26] hit yes amen and then if you don't
[41:29] change according to the word of God Amen
[41:32] then you are becoming your you're your
[41:34] own Pope
[41:37] amen yeah you're you're over the word of
[41:40] God and we don't want to be over the
[41:42] word of God Amen you know the Bible says
[41:46] that there I believe it's in
[41:47] Thessalonians it says that there was a
[41:49] there would be a man rising up amen and
[41:52] and and and he would sit in the in the
[41:54] throne amen and he would sit in the
[41:56] temple
[41:58] amen saying that he's
[42:00] God and that's what Satan wants to do in
[42:03] your temple he wants to sit in your
[42:05] temple amen and Proclaim that he is God
[42:08] that's right amen Proclaim you Proclaim
[42:11] that that that you're God right amen
[42:14] because that's what that's what he did
[42:15] that's what he did with
[42:17] Judas Judas amen came to the point that
[42:20] it was so close nobody knew that there
[42:23] was a Judas there right brother nobody
[42:25] knew that that there was there was uh
[42:28] they thought that he was probably the
[42:30] closest Christian better Christian even
[42:32] than than Peter and anyone you see he
[42:36] was a better follower than any of the
[42:38] disciples even better than
[42:41] John and John would lay on the bosom of
[42:46] Jesus but yet it was the one that was so
[42:49] close that
[42:51] deceived and was the one who ended up
[42:54] amen why because when Satan entered into
[42:56] him he said well I'm beyond the
[42:59] word and when you say that when you come
[43:01] to that point amen then you go do what
[43:03] you need to do you betray Jesus
[43:06] afterwards praise God you become your
[43:08] own
[43:09] Pope and so have not I commanded thee be
[43:13] strong and of a good courage verse n Be
[43:17] not Afraid Don't Be Afraid Saints
[43:20] neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[43:21] thy God is with thee withersoever thou
[43:24] goest amen praise the Lord and so Saints
[43:28] we know that that this story amen when
[43:30] it IT begun with eating story in in in
[43:35] the Garden of Eden it begun with eating
[43:38] with eating eating eating amen amen and
[43:43] and it's got to end with eating as well
[43:45] amen amen praise God this thing amen if
[43:50] they would have just continued eating
[43:52] off that that tree of life eventually
[43:55] their bodies would have been
[43:57] changed amen that eternal life that they
[44:00] had in their soul would eventually
[44:01] manifest on their in their bodies they
[44:03] wouldn't have died amen they wouldn't
[44:06] have died but see now in this hour that
[44:08] we're living in we have to continue
[44:10] eating off that tree of life amen and if
[44:14] you continue eating remember this word
[44:16] of God needs to be in your mouth on
[44:19] Wednesday
[44:21] nights on just Sundays amen every day
[44:25] right and not just eating but meditating
[44:28] on it right amen and so that's you
[44:30] eating that word and when you feed on
[44:33] that word and you continue eating that
[44:34] word amen you'll eventually become like
[44:37] the word you'll eventually become like
[44:39] that tree of life amen that tree of life
[44:42] will change your body so you will
[44:44] fulfill what Adam couldn't fulfill amen
[44:47] you will fulfill this bride amen is
[44:49] going to fulfill why because she's had
[44:51] one that fulfilled it for her amen the
[44:54] Lord Jesus Christ amen the second Adam
[44:56] yes and and as I always say wherever the
[44:59] head goes the body follows amen but you
[45:02] must be continually attached to that to
[45:04] that word to that head to that tree of
[45:08] life amen not just going over there and
[45:11] plucking at it every now and then that's
[45:13] what we do a lot you know we just kind
[45:15] of pluck at it here and there you know
[45:17] kind of like we're grazing a little bit
[45:19] you know kind of we're going over there
[45:20] picking up some berries and and get out
[45:23] a little basket
[45:25] and you know
[45:28] but you need to be attached to that tree
[45:30] of life amen you need to be you need to
[45:33] be right there attached to that amen
[45:35] constantly feeding off that life amen
[45:39] and people are happy with just grazing a
[45:41] little Berry here and there they're
[45:42] happy to you know come to church every
[45:44] now and then and and then and and and
[45:47] open up the Bible you know two times a
[45:49] year that's that's good enough for them
[45:52] but that's not good enough for a true
[45:53] Christian a true Christian wants to be
[45:56] in that word constantly what what what
[45:58] does it say it says the book of the law
[46:01] shall not depart out of the mouth shall
[46:03] not depart out of th
[46:05] mouth that means it's got to be your
[46:08] life amen amen it's got to be part of
[46:12] your life if it's not to depart out of
[46:14] your mouth amen then it's got to be part
[46:16] of your life hallelujah amen so we don't
[46:20] want to just be grazing a little bit
[46:22] here and there amen we want it all
[46:25] Hallelujah so so so we know that that
[46:28] this eve fell amen she disbelieved this
[46:30] word for her day amen but thank God
[46:33] there's no way that this second Eve can
[46:35] fall there's no way that this second Eve
[46:38] can fall why because she's word of his
[46:41] word b b bone of his bone life of his
[46:44] life everything that he is she is amen
[46:48] everything that that he that that that
[46:51] he is amen she is and and there's no way
[46:53] that she can fall no why because she's
[46:56] not just grazing or looking at him from
[46:58] afar she's connected to him amen praise
[47:03] God Amen and so she can't fall because
[47:06] this word amen it's she's impregnated
[47:08] with this word this seed amen just like
[47:11] Mary Amen in the
[47:13] be uh she was impregnated with the word
[47:16] amen with with with with impregnated
[47:18] with the seed of God Amen it was God's
[47:20] seed and that that was in Mary amen it
[47:23] wasn't Joseph's seed it wasn't anybody's
[47:26] seed it was God seed amen and so that's
[47:28] why Jesus wasn't Gentile or Jewish amen
[47:32] he was God Amen because it was God that
[47:35] put that egg in there and it was God
[47:37] that put that seed in there amen and so
[47:39] when Mary when that was told to Mary all
[47:41] Mary could say it
[47:43] was I don't understand it but be it unto
[47:46] me according to what you said Lord amen
[47:50] right and that's what the people of the
[47:52] children of Israel were saying Lord you
[47:53] gave the promise we don't understand all
[47:56] that was that's going on but as you said
[47:58] we're going to go and take this land
[48:01] amen because your word says your word
[48:03] said it amen and so this that's what
[48:06] that's what Mary did amen when she
[48:08] received that message amen can you
[48:10] imagine amen receiving that type of that
[48:12] type of message from an angel and and
[48:14] you're just you know you girls doing
[48:17] your laundry or doing something doing
[48:19] your homework and and an angel just
[48:21] appears right there in front of you and
[48:23] you know and but Mary at this time she
[48:25] was she was married or she was to she
[48:27] was going to be married and and
[48:30] uh and given this type of news she knew
[48:35] that the promise was there in the word
[48:37] she knew in Isaiah she'd read the
[48:39] Scrolls her she knew about this but she
[48:42] never thought that she would be the one
[48:43] to fulfill
[48:46] that what would cause Amen to for God to
[48:49] gravitate towards her amen God must have
[48:53] seen something there there Amen in her
[48:55] life that amen that would that would say
[48:58] she's the one that I'm going to fulfill
[49:00] that word in my amen praise the Lord
[49:03] there's there was a
[49:06] representation in God's mind amen I
[49:08] believe that that God even knew that
[49:10] even before the foundation of the world
[49:11] that it was married that was to give
[49:13] birth to Jesus amen it's the same thing
[49:16] with you and I amen it's before the
[49:18] foundations of The World God knew that
[49:20] you were going to receive this word and
[49:23] he had that exact word ready for you
[49:25] amen what a wonderful thing it is to
[49:27] serve God in this hour amen that he
[49:29] knows all things and that nothing takes
[49:32] him by surprise amen
[49:35] hallelujah praise God so she cannot give
[49:38] birth to any other thing amen this
[49:40] second Eve can't give birth to any other
[49:41] thing but that word amen amen praise God
[49:46] praise the Lord Jesus now in Luke 1 128
[49:48] it says and the angel came in unto her
[49:50] and said hail that thou art highly
[49:52] favored the Lord is with thee blessed
[49:54] art thou among women amen praise the
[49:57] Lord Jesus and and Luke 138 said Mary
[49:59] said behold the handmade of the Lord be
[50:01] it unto me according to Thy word amen
[50:05] not according to my thoughts not
[50:07] according to what I think it is amen but
[50:10] according to Thy word Lord according to
[50:12] what you said let that word be fulfilled
[50:15] in me praise God Amen and and and that's
[50:18] you submitting to the word amen that's
[50:21] you amen surrendering totally Amen to
[50:24] that word amen and that's the only way
[50:27] that the word can change you in this
[50:28] hour amen praise God and you know what
[50:30] the bride of Christ says the same thing
[50:32] amen amen let that word of God Amen
[50:35] whatever it is Lord if it needs to to to
[50:38] to to change me in whatever way whatever
[50:41] needs to happen in my life Let It Be
[50:43] Lord because I need amen I need it amen
[50:46] if it needs to hit me in whatever way
[50:48] Lord Jesus let it be
[50:51] so praise
[50:53] God it would be so nice Amen to come to
[50:56] church and nobody say anything against
[50:58] us and the preacher never preaches again
[51:02] you know against our lives you know and
[51:05] things like that that would be
[51:07] wonderful but you know there's churches
[51:09] that exist that that are like that oh
[51:12] yeah you can watch them on YouTube
[51:15] too usually the pastors you know they
[51:17] they they don't they don't preach
[51:19] against you know the LGBT community they
[51:22] they're very inclusive they you see them
[51:24] with ripped jeans and little small
[51:26] little glass Pulpit up there in front of
[51:28] the you know and they're very just very
[51:32] inclusive you
[51:33] know anybody would like to go to that
[51:36] kind of church you know and Jesus but
[51:39] Jesus amen he rebuked when he needed to
[51:42] rebuke amen he was a party pooper if you
[51:46] if I could say say
[51:48] that you know I remember one in Matthew
[51:50] 24 you know that the disciples they came
[51:53] to Jesus and they were talking about
[51:54] Lord look at this this Temple and how
[51:56] beautiful the this Temple is and and how
[51:59] wonderful how magnificent look what look
[52:01] what man has done wow that's wonderful
[52:04] and Jesus said don't you know that all
[52:05] this is going to be destroyed yes sir
[52:09] right we're admiring everything that man
[52:11] has done and Jesus all of a sudden just
[52:14] just tears it tears it tears them down
[52:17] you know just well that's what Jesus
[52:20] likes to do
[52:23] amen but at the same time he was also
[52:25] the life of the the party as
[52:28] well so because why he was he was the
[52:32] one he harlot's liked for him to be
[52:35] around around them the DR drunkards why
[52:38] because he was there to try to save amen
[52:41] not Rebel in what they were doing amen
[52:43] but he would try to save amen he says
[52:45] because the phys you know you Pharisees
[52:47] don't need a doctor you say that you
[52:49] already are okay in his heart God knew
[52:52] that they weren't but here these are the
[52:56] people that need to that that that need
[52:58] a touch in their life amen and and so he
[53:00] was the one he was there he would be
[53:03] he'd both be the party pooper but also
[53:05] he'd be the life of the party as well
[53:07] amen praise God in other words he was
[53:10] balanced amen praise the
[53:12] Lord and so real quick Saints amen the
[53:16] the the the Mana amen real quick let's
[53:18] talk about this Mana that the children
[53:20] of Israel were eating you know that that
[53:23] that Mana that fell in the wilderness
[53:25] amen it it fell every day and every day
[53:28] that they had to go and pick up that
[53:30] Mana amen otherwise it would spoil and
[53:34] they would have to uh and God commanded
[53:36] them that every day they'd have to go
[53:38] out and and pick up that Mana why it was
[53:40] fresh new experience every day amen
[53:44] every day amen it has with with the word
[53:46] of God Amen it has to be a fresh
[53:49] experience praise the Lord amen and if
[53:52] if your experience has wiggle Tails amen
[53:54] then just go get back in the word
[53:57] amen you know sometimes we we wonder how
[54:00] can I get closer to God it's it's right
[54:02] there amen the Bible is sitting on your

[55:09] and put that original Mana that fell to
[55:11] go and put it behind the the the holies
[55:14] of
[55:15] holies and that Mana that was on behind
[55:17] that holies of holies never never
[55:20] spoiled amen why because it was attached
[55:22] to the tree of life it was attached to
[55:25] the life of God was always always there
[55:26] amen praise the Lord and so in order for
[55:29] you to eat that original Mana the
