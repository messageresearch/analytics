[8:43] him for a long time and he went to the
[8:44] doctor and Lord he had it in this on his
[8:47] pelvis on his spine in his gym neck all
[8:56] over lungs it hits you soft tissue there
[8:59] in the lungs anyway long story short
[9:01] we've been we've been just not not so
[9:04] much laying hands on praying but but
[9:06] just praying that God as we do business
[9:09] with them that
[9:10] God would bless their business well you
[9:12] know what blessing the business means
[9:14] blessing the blessing the people so we
[9:17] get a report today that she'd get sent
[9:19] June or taxes said she went the her
[9:21] husband went to the doctor and he's only
[9:23] 40-something years old and he went to
[9:25] the doctor and the can't find the cancer
[9:28] on his watch in the spine and on his
[9:31] pelvic bone and somewhere can't even
[9:34] find that cancer and whatever the
[9:37] whatever the mass that was on his spine
[9:41] his dead non cancerous nothing non
[9:44] cancerous right alright and the one
[9:47] that's in his shoulder in his stomach
[9:50] has just a small amount of cancer cells
[9:53] so this guy's I mean in October she was
[9:57] looking at him not making it to
[9:58] Christmas right Thanksgiving
[10:02] Thanksgiving he all he cooked
[10:04] Thanksgiving dinner every year and this
[10:06] year he could not finish it because he
[10:08] felt so bad
[10:08] but God has went and intervened and just
[10:12] by the prayer of doesn't matter you say
[10:14] well I didn't pray yeah you just just
[10:16] pray when you pray for us it's a
[10:19] connection with each one so yeah with
[10:21] all things are possible to them that
[10:26] believe doesn't matter you know you say
[10:27] well they're not believers I've heard of
[10:29] that enough my heavenly days don't get
[10:30] me started the bible does not say if
[10:33] you're a believer like a message
[10:35] believer
[10:36] it says if you'll believe what God said
[10:38] he'll heal you listen folks that healing
[10:42] angel is up there in the hospital right
[10:44] now in Gainesville healing prostitute
[10:47] sinners because God has put forth the
[10:50] healing anointing on everybody your body
[10:53] heals itself every day whether you
[10:54] believe it or not your body is in the
[10:56] healing process but God's up there right
[10:58] now the doctor did their cutting and all
[11:01] that but God had to put all that cells
[11:03] back together so I always when I Drive
[11:05] by hospital I said oh man there's got to
[11:06] be angels there there got to be the
[11:10] healing angels have got to be there to
[11:11] hospital because some of them make it
[11:13] out or some of them don't but you know
[11:14] what that's the prevalence of God we
[11:16] just leave that alone but good to be in
[11:18] the house of the Lord dad said sunday
[11:20] school teachers just do your Sunday
[11:22] School
[11:23] Sunday and then get back up here we'll
[11:26] try to get back up here 10 o'clock
[11:28] and just remember sisters y'all have
[11:31] done a great job downstairs it's already
[11:32] set up and ready to go for the weekend
[11:35] when many people do it doesn't take very
[11:39] long
[11:39] okay so thank God for that also brother
[11:42] Michael Teague just talked to him a few
[11:43] minutes ago he's coming up Saturday and
[11:45] he's looking forward to being with us on
[11:48] Sunday I hadn't been up here no in a
[11:49] while he'd bend a few ministers meetings
[11:51] over the years I don't think he's
[11:52] preached in 10 or 15 years maybe longer
[11:54] so brother Michael teach ones that he's
[11:57] he's a solid one he's one of them like
[12:00] brother Chris and the different ones
[12:01] that we have are friends that are just
[12:02] real solid Christians never been wild in
[12:06] their doctrine and actually they came to
[12:09] church here back in the 70s for a little
[12:11] while when they first come in the
[12:12] message so um just pray for him

[13:09] January the 18th fellowship meeting here
[13:11] 3:30 brother Aaron McGarry from formerly
[13:14] from Dallas Texas but now he lives in
[13:16] Hickory North Carolina he goes to
[13:19] brother bear coffees Church but he will
[13:21] be here that Saturday and that Sunday to
[13:23] speak for us so keep those people in
[13:25] your prayers and pray for them
[13:27] brother Brown says the success of his
[13:29] meetings is prayer of the people not
[13:32] just it you know what he was a prophet
[13:34] but he didn't just walk up and say I'm a
[13:36] prophet y'all don't need to
[13:37] I bring everything I need no he didn't
[13:40] ever say that he needed your prayers
[13:42] just like we all need your prayers
[13:43] that's what we're gonna talk about a
[13:45] little bit about revival but if you got
[13:46] your Bibles turn to the Book of Psalms
[13:49] Psalms 85 so I'm to 85 verse one let's
[14:05] bow our heads and pray to the master the
[14:09] Lord Jesus today we stand up needy
[14:13] people
[14:15] we need healing
[14:18] we need healing of the soul as well as
[14:22] healing of the body
[14:24] Lord some that are lost Lord late they
[14:26] need you father
[14:29] Lord I pray that as we begin this little
[14:35] journey of revival that as the prophet
[14:39] said it's not so much as revving the
[14:42] music up and shouting and speaking in
[14:45] tongues and that's really not a revival
[14:49] revival is to revive what's already in
[14:51] our heart but Lord it also catches the
[14:55] ones that have not had a revival and
[14:57] brings them to the Lord and then they
[14:59] can start the revival the prophet of God
[15:03] said is a revival begins souls are saved
[15:06] because of the pull and many people are
[15:09] healed because of the revival that is
[15:13] upon the people
[15:14] Lord we all need you more than anything
[15:17] we pray tonight that you would be this
[15:20] full speaker that you would be the one
[15:23] that does the revealing father we've
[15:26] been in this journey for a long time
[15:28] some more than others but Lord we know
[15:32] it's coming down to an end to where this
[15:34] thing's going to wind up and it's
[15:38] brother Claude always says the Bible
[15:39] speaks those who endure to the end shall
[15:42] be saved
[15:44] father we pray that we will endure we
[15:48] will endure sound doctrine
[15:50] we will endure the labors of our love we
[15:54] will endure the healing of our body even
[15:57] if even if Lord our body is not healed
[15:59] at the moment Lord we pray that you
[16:01] would continue to let us yield to that
[16:05] healing angel that healing power that's
[16:08] in us it wants to heal us more than we
[16:12] want to be healed father we pray that
[16:15] you just be with us now this season
[16:17] coming up ward is hustle and bustle and
[16:19] all the different things but Lord let us
[16:21] not forget that as Christians you're the
[16:26] reason for every season not just this
[16:29] one we pray that you'd just be with us
[16:32] now
[16:33] season us for this journey in Jesus name
[16:36] we pray amen
[16:38] all right revival part 1 Psalms 85 verse
[16:43] 1 says to the chief musician of some for
[16:45] the son of Korah Lord thou has been
[16:47] favorable into the land now that's
[16:50] brought back the captivity of Jacob thou
[16:53] has forgiven the iniquity of thy people
[16:55] el has covered all their sins see law
[16:58] thou has taken away all thy wrath what
[17:01] feels good done now has turned thyself
[17:04] from the fierceness of thine anger turn
[17:08] us O God of our salvation and caused on
[17:10] anger toward us to cease wilt thou be
[17:14] angry with us forever
[17:15] wilt thou draw out that anger to all
[17:18] generations question wilt thou not
[17:22] revive us again that the people may
[17:25] rejoice in thee show us thy mercy O Lord
[17:29] and grant us thy salvation let us go to
[17:32] 2nd chronicles and you be seated after
[17:34] that 2nd chronicles 7:14 what's this if
[17:38] my people which are called by my name
[17:41] now we know this is all Old Testament
[17:43] and it's all speaking to Israel but
[17:45] remember and type it speaking to us we
[17:48] don't do away with the Old Testament
[17:49] just because we're not Jews hey man
[17:51] we're by nature were that we're Jews by
[17:54] nature if my people
[17:55] you're his people aren't you so don't
[17:58] exclude yourself if my people which are
[18:01] called by my name now we know
[18:04] what name to call it's not the middle
[18:07] person of the Trinity we know who we're
[18:10] talking to all right so we need to put
[18:13] that in the bed get it rid of it get out
[18:15] that's done we know who we're talking to
[18:20] which are called by my name shall humble
[18:24] themselves now this is our part and pray
[18:27] and seek my face and turn from their
[18:30] wicked ways then will I hear from heaven
[18:33] and will forgive their sin and will heal
[18:36] their land now mine eyes shall be open
[18:39] in my ears attend unto the prayer that
[18:43] is made in this place for now have I
[18:47] chosen and sanctified this house not
[18:51] this building this house for I have
[18:55] chosen and sanctified this house that my
[18:58] name may be there mrs. Jesus Christ
[19:01] forever and my eyes and my heart shall
[19:05] be there perpetually in other words over
[19:08] and over and over again you may be
[19:10] seated in the Lord at his blessing to
[19:12] the reading of the word now to get
[19:14] started with this I'm not gonna I'm just
[19:17] gonna lay a back ground and thank you
[19:21] all for coming and and sharing the
[19:23] midweek service with us and and I pray
[19:26] that and attendance doesn't mean a lot
[19:30] but it's like dad says he's when he when
[19:33] he starts an important series looks like
[19:35] people don't come to church so I just
[19:37] just try your bet you know what if
[19:39] you'll try I'll guarantee you God will
[19:41] do his part
[19:43] but if you don't do your part he's not
[19:46] obligated to do his Amen so let's try to
[19:49] be humble with this and let's try to
[19:52] keep this and it's not going to be a
[19:54] revival that's going to actually go out
[19:56] beyond these walls it's not a world wide
[20:00] sweeping revival it's a personal revival
[20:03] and you caused it not me not God I'll
[20:09] read you some clothes brother Ram said
[20:10] god don't start revivals man starts
[20:14] revivals
[20:16] mmm so we'll read some of this but I
[20:18] just want to lay a background because we
[20:20] won't be speaking for another we'll be
[20:22] here next Sunday but or the Sunday after
[20:24] but I want to kind of get into a groove
[20:27] in January maybe in and get into this a
[20:29] little bit more because like I said
[20:31] there's 24 2571 quotes I went through
[20:33] that brother Brown talked about revival
[20:36] well some of them are not pertinent what
[20:37] we need but a lot of them are so we're
[20:39] going to read them and I was telling
[20:41] about the Bob just to get you to get
[20:43] your mind in order and I'll bring that
[20:46] quote later on but brother Branham said
[20:48] he said what happened at the turn of the
[20:50] century was because man had not advanced
[20:55] so much in the medical realm that people
[21:03] were dying of cancer the the the death
[21:05] rate in the 1800's in the 1900s I'll
[21:08] bring this later but I want you to think
[21:09] about this the death rate of men men
[21:11] didn't live past about 45 years 45 to 50
[21:15] and men died of all different things
[21:17] cancers and cancer was just coming up
[21:19] there in the late 1800s and early
[21:21] nineteen hundred's there was no cure
[21:23] there was no cobalt that was not even
[21:24] anything they just said you're gone
[21:26] you're finished
[21:27] well what brother Branham says he said
[21:29] God then heard the people's cry his
[21:33] Christian people that were caught in
[21:35] this trap cried out to God for a
[21:39] deliverance of that disease and diseases
[21:43] so about 1906 God sent the Holy Ghost on
[21:46] the zoo the street to bring back the
[21:47] gifts then there came a little bit
[21:49] further and here comes a man named
[21:50] William Branham and what was his first
[21:53] campaign healing campaign and and the
[21:56] angel told him the first time he met him
[22:00] he said cancer won't even stand in your
[22:02] way so that was in what 19 30 29 30 37
[22:07] 33 33 somewhere in there that he got his
[22:10] commission from the angel whatever day
[22:12] it is but anyway doesn't matter he got
[22:15] his Commission and he told him what he
[22:16] was going to do and it would be a
[22:18] worldwide revival but it would be a
[22:21] healing revival because and here's my
[22:23] point here we are in 2020 we get a tooth
[22:30] had a sore a pimple of that we got the
[22:34] doctor because it hello there's a CVS on
[22:39] every corner almost almost
[22:43] that's you know CVS that's what they did
[22:45] their own Everett their own corners they
[22:48] don't buy down anywhere else they buy
[22:49] own corners cuz they said you got to
[22:50] come to the corner to get your drugs
[22:53] you'll think about that in a minute so
[22:57] so but listen our cabinets are full of
[23:01] medicine listen in the 1800s they had a
[23:04] little bit of opium and a lot of liquor
[23:08] alcohol and that's what they got they
[23:11] they would do surgeries that way with
[23:13] those different things but you
[23:14] understand what I'm saying but so
[23:15] brother Brown said the cry of the people
[23:17] has always brought the revival the
[23:20] crimes of people brought there was no
[23:22] advancement in science back in the
[23:25] eighteen your to see some of the
[23:27] documentaries in in the war and this War
[23:30] Between the States 1860 1865 well if you
[23:33] had a bad limb they just sawed it off or
[23:36] you know they didn't try to save
[23:38] anything cuz they had no advancement but
[23:40] here you come up in the 1900s and here
[23:42] comes this thing called cancer and all
[23:44] these different things and there's they
[23:46] just started to name it but they had no
[23:47] cure for it so the people started crying
[23:50] out then to God because there was no CBS
[23:52] on every corner there was no healing
[23:54] campaign going around anywhere you had
[23:57] Smith Wigglesworth which came up into
[23:59] the 30s 20s and 30s and 40s when he died
[24:03] right there when he died brother Brown
[24:05] comes on the scene so God perpetuates
[24:07] then a worldwide healing campaign
[24:10] through that revival why because the
[24:12] people called for it the people called
[24:16] for that revival of healing you said all
[24:19] it was promised don't you think God no
[24:21] need to put it in the Bible that we
[24:24] would need it he knew we would cry out
[24:26] for it anything you sometimes we
[24:27] wouldn't cry out for things it's what
[24:32] you cry out for all right so let's look
[24:35] at this real quick
[24:36] like I said won't be uh won't be too
[24:39] long tonight let's look at the Hebrew
[24:42] lexicon and see what their saves now
[24:43] look
[24:44] we're Bible has many meanings excuse me
[24:48] I like these now revita us now look when
[24:57] we say that somebody died passed out
[25:03] whatever and we gave them CPR and they
[25:05] revived that's really not the correct
[25:09] word to use because to revive as to you
[25:13] already have life you're just bringing
[25:15] it up watch to live have life remain
[25:20] alive sustain life live prosperously
[25:23] live forever look be quick enough what
[25:27] God tells us through the prophet that
[25:29] the quickening power in the end time is
[25:31] what's going to take us out of here amen
[25:33] be quickened now this is revival so
[25:36] every time I say the word revival I want
[25:38] you to think of these words be alive
[25:40] listen we're not here to revive sinners
[25:44] sinners need a resurrection sinners need
[25:49] a resurrection if you're not born again
[25:51] today you need to be ready to be
[25:53] actually killed and then resurrected not
[25:56] revived to be revived is as you've not
[26:00] been without water for days and no food
[26:04] and it wasn't hurting some of us hey
[26:06] brother Aaron did they just walk in
[26:10] right on cue but but to revive us is
[26:16] okay you waited okay he wait here to
[26:18] what I was saying but to revive us this
[26:20] man you see the guy in the movies you
[26:22] know and he's my too fast Louise sorry
[26:25] he told me to slow down so you see the
[26:27] guy you know and he's about dead and his
[26:28] cheeks roll or lips all cracked up and
[26:31] somebody just takes him puts a little
[26:33] water in you know boy just perks them
[26:34] right up it works in the movies but but
[26:40] that's what we're here to do in this
[26:42] series that we're going to is we're
[26:44] going to what we're gonna give you some
[26:45] cool water maybe you're thirsty you're
[26:48] thirsty for something because look also
[26:50] brother branham and I'll read them later
[26:52] on brother branham calls a revival rain
[26:55] but
[26:56] what does rain do you see the corn I
[26:59] need to cut the crops out in the field
[27:01] and it hasn't rained and they're what
[27:02] they're all been over but man give it
[27:05] about a two-day rank good soaking rain
[27:07] what does it do it revives and that
[27:09] staying straight back up again well
[27:11] that's kind of the way we are we've been
[27:12] in this long journey in and we've seen
[27:15] you know you see people falling away and
[27:17] all these different things but there is
[27:20] a truth there is a revival that will
[27:23] happen that will wake this bride up and
[27:25] take us out of here all right be
[27:30] restored to life and health to continue
[27:34] in life remain alive how many of us
[27:37] wants to remain alive
[27:38] amen I know we're all dead in Christ but
[27:42] I'd like to remain alive because it said
[27:43] the Bible says the live and remains in
[27:46] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[27:47] or hinder those which are asleep in
[27:49] other words you're not going to die
[27:54] because listen the people in the grave
[27:57] tonight they don't need to be revived
[28:01] they need to be resurrected
[28:03] I'm talking about the natural part
[28:05] they've already been resurrected in the
[28:07] spiritual part that's why they're gonna
[28:08] come out of the ground because they're
[28:10] connected to that resurrection they died
[28:13] the old person with what we bury them in
[28:16] corruption and we raise them in in
[28:18] corruption a man will never see that
[28:21] that's what just burns in my heart even
[28:23] when we and I and it it's a bad
[28:26] separation when when somebody passes
[28:28] away but you know one thing's for sure
[28:30] they're way better off than we are and
[28:32] they will ever have to die again they'll
[28:34] never have to go it's conquered it's
[28:36] done and over with
[28:38] we're just waiting a time to see them
[28:40] again
[28:41] never to be old again never to be sick
[28:46] never to be have great hair and lose it
[28:50] and all this other stuff amen but to be
[28:55] quickened be alive be restored to life
[29:00] and health
[29:04] I'll tell you something do
[29:07] happened to me a couple weeks ago and
[29:09] I'll give you the testimony later
[29:10] because this testimony and preaching
[29:12] needs to be separate but just to help
[29:14] you a little bit you talk to your body
[29:17] you talk to your body because God said
[29:21] never said he wants you to be sick
[29:24] anywhere in the Bible does that say God
[29:26] wants you to be sick no he knows we're
[29:28] going to be sick
[29:29] but here there's a healing anointing
[29:31] what brother Brown say the right mental
[29:33] attitude to any promise of God will make
[29:36] it come to pass so even the right mental
[29:38] attitude if you start getting the pain
[29:40] here and there
[29:41] sister Anna get a pain somewhere just
[29:44] deny it work your way through it work
[29:49] your way through it you say why that's
[29:52] just the power of positive thinking I
[29:53] kind of like that I don't like to be
[29:57] negative thinking I'm gonna die
[30:00] hallelujah by and by Lenny what that
[30:02] says there's no what that means continue
[30:05] in life so as we go through this revival
[30:08] we know that that it is a to a Christian
[30:12] it's a continual reviving of what we
[30:15] already have and as I prayed before and
[30:19] I read the prophets message he said now
[30:20] revival and I'll read it to you in a
[30:22] minute a revival is not for the center
[30:26] but under the anointing of the revival
[30:30] the center realizes and looks over and
[30:33] says wow I don't have that that's not
[30:37] affecting me like it's affecting this
[30:39] person maybe I need what that person's
[30:41] got so then you do see centers come in
[30:44] and get saved and filled with the Holy
[30:45] Ghost and always brother Branham said
[30:48] always a revival it's connected with the
[30:50] healing campaign no we know it's not
[30:51] ever gonna be a worldwide healing
[30:53] campaign and I'm sorry to tell you it's
[30:56] not going to be a worldwide healing
[30:59] campaign it's gonna be an individual
[31:01] thing brother Brown said that won't be a
[31:04] public show so forget about anything
[31:06] that's out there it's gonna be in you
[31:09] and your house and when I say your house
[31:12] I really mean this house but I'm gonna
[31:13] read you a quote where brother BAM said
[31:15] it starts in your natural house all
[31:18] right let's go around here to Hosea
[31:19] let's see when this rabbi
[31:20] supposed to happen we've had revivals
[31:22] all down through time but watch Hosea
[31:24] six verse one says come let us return
[31:29] unto the Lord for he hath porn and he
[31:32] will heal us
[31:33] he has smitten and he will bind us after
[31:37] two days after two thousand years
[31:41] because a thousand years a day a day is
[31:43] a thousand years right after two
[31:45] thousand years will he revive us
[31:47] oh yeah Paul went through a revival
[31:49] Irina's they all went through their
[31:51] revival but this revival that we're
[31:53] going to be in is a bride revival that's
[31:56] going to carry us into a body change it
[31:58] was not going to carry them into that
[32:01] and then after two days will he revive
[32:05] us in the third day he will raise us up
[32:08] and we shall live in his sight so that's
[32:12] what we're heading toward all the signs
[32:14] mm-hmm let's thinking the other day you
[32:17] know there's a lot of prophecy and
[32:19] there's a lot of things that do pertain
[32:21] to us and there's things that don't
[32:22] pertain to us the things that don't
[32:25] pertain to us we need to just let it go
[32:27] cuz I'm not gonna be in a tribulation so
[32:29] I don't need to know what's gonna go on
[32:30] during that time I don't want to know
[32:32] that my skin's gonna fall off my body
[32:34] and the birds are gonna eat meat while
[32:36] I'm alive that's not something I'm gonna
[32:38] be a part of you we got to start
[32:49] thinking right that this is it there's
[32:55] nothing else prophecy is being fulfilled
[32:58] daily daily we are watching Bible
[33:04] prophecy come to light and we're also
[33:06] watching what the prophet of God told us
[33:08] come to light we see that we're living
[33:11] it why because it's the vision Jesus
[33:15] said tell the vision to no one listen
[33:17] we've been in a vision we've been in a
[33:20] vision of what God saw before the
[33:21] foundation of the world we just got to
[33:26] make that vision reality but you know
[33:29] what bride don't get discouraged
[33:32] somebody will make it somebody will
[33:36] fulfill scripture and listen fear not
[33:40] little flock little flock maybe there's
[33:48] too many around it's not become little
[33:50] anymore we're gonna read about two
[33:53] children of Israel right here to N so
[33:54] let's go Kay let's start with the quote
[33:55] number one make a few comments and like
[33:59] I said mm-hmm we finish early we stand
[34:01] around talking nine o'clock anyway but
[34:04] that's okay that's all right cuz we're
[34:07] all family look and now look this is the
[34:10] prayer I want us I want you to I want
[34:14] you to read this as your prayer no I'm
[34:15] taking this from brother branham's the
[34:17] deity of Jesus Christ 1949 then watch
[34:19] and now start a revival in the hearts of
[34:22] the people this morning Lord may this be
[34:25] a renewing time a time when the spirit
[34:28] will be renewed and old father we'd pray
[34:32] it this way come get us by the hand each
[34:36] one of us and walk us down this lane
[34:39] here show to us this great picture that
[34:43] said in order here vision revealing your
[34:49] secrets to the Saints hearts this
[34:51] morning that we might see what's out
[34:54] here just before us now look he's seeing
[34:58] what's before us cuz he knew there was a
[35:00] lot coming we're it we're it I don't see
[35:06] a whole bunch of world wide revival
[35:08] again and bringing a whole bunch of
[35:09] people in and filling the pews up I'm
[35:12] praying that that happens cuz listen if
[35:14] everybody excuse me the wall right here
[35:18] under my feet if every person in that
[35:20] wall comes to the Lord we're gonna have
[35:23] to find a bigger auditorium but you know
[35:26] what are you going to leave them out I'm
[35:29] praying just as well as they come in as
[35:31] anybody else I don't care if it's your
[35:33] child or my child husband wife whatever
[35:37] but listen to this prayer this was 1949
[35:42] some of you weren't even born
[35:45] daddy was nine years old he's a little
[35:47] kid when this prayer was pray been a
[35:49] long time but watch what he says as we
[35:54] walk down then Lord in the armor of God
[35:57] may we go as gallant soldiers to face
[36:00] the enemy and I think the other day in
[36:01] light of all those things that's been
[36:02] going on
[36:03] you know battle is not pretty
[36:06] a battle is messy a battle is bloody
[36:10] it's man against man I'm talking about a
[36:13] natural it's a battle but even in our
[36:16] spiritual battle there's something that
[36:18] gets wounded there's something that gets
[36:19] killed there's something that gets has
[36:21] to be left behind
[36:22] but it's a battle but it's the same
[36:24] soldiers you're on the same team
[36:27] okay reach and pick that person up bring
[36:31] them with you but look but how can we
[36:34] face them unless we know his tactics now
[36:37] listen for 50 something years we've been
[36:40] learning the tactics of the devil you
[36:44] say brother wait do you think you got
[36:45] him figured out I don't think I have but
[36:47] I think God's already got him figured
[36:49] out and if God's right here inside of me
[36:51] he's gonna help me figure him out amen
[36:53] and he's gonna do it through all of us
[36:57] listen me and brother Dale will the
[36:59] ministers don't have this thing figured
[37:01] out but God does and he said he would
[37:04] speak through us in the end time through
[37:08] preachers and teachers and evangelists
[37:10] and all these different things it helped
[37:13] us this morning to understand and show
[37:16] us his foregrounds there so that we'll
[37:18] know where to meet him for we ask it in
[37:22] Jesus name Amen that's the prayer that
[37:25] you ought to maybe put on your
[37:27] refrigerator if you want to look it up
[37:29] but look he covers everything we need
[37:31] for the journey and like I said before
[37:34] it's been a long journey
[37:36] I've only been privileged to be the last
[37:38] 20 years of it but some of you have been
[37:40] 4050 years
[37:41] I remember when Larry brother Larry had
[37:44] a lot of higher sister Jeanne still got
[37:49] hurt it's just a little different color
[37:52] but we were younger then and you know
[37:54] what you get younger and you think man
[37:56] then everybody thought 1977 and ever
[37:59] thought this and everybody thought that
[38:00] and here we are almost at 2020 just
[38:04] right on the door of it and who would
[38:07] have thought it but we're here for a
[38:09] reason we're not here because God got
[38:14] fooled somewhere down the road
[38:15] he knew this whole thing I think another
[38:18] day you know and I think God you know
[38:20] God's a person right and the devil is
[38:22] too and I think the gun God in the devil
[38:26] has conversations Satan says you seen
[38:29] them do that he said I knew things gonna
[38:32] do it for the foundation of the world
[38:33] but oh no I don't see any more because I
[38:36] hear their voice saying God forgive me
[38:39] of what I just did and then it goes in
[38:42] that sea of forgetfulness and Satan
[38:44] still remembers it and he just clambers
[38:46] for ages and ages and ages and he God
[38:50] says I'll have a clue what you're
[38:51] talking about
[38:54] in that great that you have a God that
[38:57] just goes I don't know all I see is
[39:02] perfection
[39:04] all I see is what the word said about
[39:06] him because you know what he can't do
[39:08] any different than what his word said
[39:09] about us his word says we are perfect we
[39:13] are coming to completion to perfection
[39:16] by what praying and studying this is not
[39:21] a time for us to lay the sword down it's
[39:24] not a time for us to lay the Bible down
[39:26] it's time for more and more I this thing
[39:32] right here has helped me a lot because
[39:33] you know what it reminds this old man to
[39:36] pray especially for his mother she's
[39:40] going through a battle but I believe
[39:43] she's Victoria we've all we all go
[39:46] through battles but every time I turn my
[39:47] hand over and I see that or I shift it I
[39:49] pray because it says look you some of
[39:51] you have won by His stripes I am healed
[39:53] and it doesn't stop there I shall not
[39:56] die but live and declare the works of
[39:59] the Lord not just I'm going to live and
[40:02] just be alive we're allowed now to
[40:04] declare the works of the Lord
[40:07] you need to remind God why you're here
[40:12] God I'm here because I'm your bride I'm
[40:16] here because you promised in this
[40:18] endtime this is what you'll do for me
[40:21] brother Brahma always said he said God
[40:23] does not mind if you remind him of his
[40:26] promises because you know why because
[40:29] then God looks back and he says you've
[40:31] been studying hattingh you
[40:32] you've been reading what I wrote yeah I
[40:36] think God's got a sense of humor look at
[40:39] some of us are you giggling about number
[40:45] two let's look at this one 1951 the
[40:50] angel of the Lord I'm reading some of
[40:51] these that are a little bit early in his
[40:53] ministry and when we see these crowds
[40:56] gathering that doesn't mean revival
[40:59] that's just the gathering hmm let's
[41:03] don't ever make this place of gathering
[41:05] let's don't ever make this place a
[41:08] gathering we come here to worship God to
[41:12] hear from God I appreciate we have not
[41:15] done it in a lot in the past but when we
[41:17] started with brother Joe and brother
[41:19] Lewis and brother Boyd doing the song
[41:20] leading and the different things they
[41:23] come back in the back and we have prayer
[41:24] to set the tone for the service that's
[41:28] coming we set the tone we don't go in
[41:31] and talk about what the stock market is
[41:32] doing no we go in then we pray fervently
[41:35] that God will anoint the song leader to
[41:39] anoint you and then that anointing will
[41:42] follow me or the preach of this here but
[41:45] I want that to be a connection amen
[41:48] I don't want to be so like Catholicism
[41:51] where the priest is so untouchable to
[41:52] where he's got no he's not infallible I
[41:54] promise you that neither a weak but we
[41:58] do best I can we do the best we can with
[42:00] what we've got at the moment so we
[42:03] preach and we pray that the song leader
[42:04] does the right thing you people that
[42:06] play brothers and sisters that play the
[42:08] music music don't walk up here and have
[42:10] everything in the world on your mind
[42:13] stop for one minute whiny little man and
[42:16] say God let me play for you not for
[42:20] these people let me play this for you so
[42:24] let that sound
[42:25] we'll go out in the congregation and
[42:27] somebody will get anointed what to hear
[42:32] the word come it's a word revival folks
[42:34] it's not I I pray that we have shouting
[42:37] and speaking in tongues some of you
[42:39] would absolutely die if you raised your
[42:41] hands just raise your hands it go it go
[42:48] [Applause]
[42:51] how do you say that in Spanish that's
[42:58] exactly right
[42:59] sound just right I never could wonder
[43:04] how a dog can understand English and
[43:06] then then a dog and that have a
[43:09] spanish-speaking family and the dog does
[43:12] the same thing for them and I don't I
[43:14] don't get it anyway and I can't learn
[43:16] the liquor Spanish though and he learns
[43:19] it just like that and when you see these
[43:23] crowds gathering that doesn't mean
[43:26] revival so look don't look for and I
[43:29] pray that the pews fill up and it plays
[43:31] a few more comments going to fill up a
[43:33] lot more but pray that you have an
[43:36] individual revival that means when you
[43:39] go to work you have a revival when
[43:41] you're driving down the road you have a
[43:42] revival even in your darkest moment you
[43:46] still have a revival that's just a
[43:53] gathering but a revival is when people
[43:56] get really right with God and pray
[43:59] through and starts a revival throughout
[44:02] the city and everything now this is 1951
[44:04] his revelation came up further he knew
[44:07] it wasn't going to be a worldwide
[44:08] revival in the 60s because it happened
[44:11] right here in the 50s
[44:12] remember the Pentecostals I was looking
[44:15] at one on YouTube the other day and
[44:17] somewhere all was his name an older
[44:20] gentleman some of you may have he was a
[44:21] good preacher at this time but he's
[44:23] calling for a revival in this 1970s a
[44:25] world wide sweeping revival in the 1970s
[44:28] I thought dude it's already happened and
[44:30] you were old enough to have been in it
[44:33] and missed it but brother Brahim said to
[44:37] Pentecostals you've called for this
[44:38] revival and you've called for this
[44:39] revival he said it's here and you
[44:41] already missed it start a revival
[44:46] throughout the city and everything you
[44:48] see they put away sin put away their
[44:50] iniquity that's when I read that first
[44:52] verse their turn to God turn around and
[44:54] start back against thee on the road I
[44:58] challenge you to pray more and study
[45:00] more this next year coming up pray a
[45:04] little more study a little more the
[45:07] Bible says study to show yourself
[45:08] approved not me approve you approve but
[45:14] you know what God if God approves you
[45:16] you won't be deceived you will not be
[45:20] deceived
[45:21] alright number three number three the
[45:27] resurrection of Lazarus 1951 this is
[45:30] right after he preached the angel of the
[45:32] Lord to brother I feel real good about
[45:34] it anyhow what this church needs today
[45:36] is a good revival look not a new
[45:39] doctrine a new order just the stirring
[45:42] of what you already know about listen
[45:45] there should be enough we have in this
[45:48] church and I'm going to crow a little
[45:50] bit because I think I can we have took
[45:52] the major doctrines of this message and
[45:54] have proven to you that they're correct
[45:57] there brother Branham was not false
[45:59] brother random is not wrong he was the
[46:03] prophet that told us was straight from
[46:06] the mind of God I don't care what they
[46:09] say about dates and times I do that
[46:12] doesn't bother me one bit he gave us
[46:18] that word and it opened the book and it
[46:22] opened our eyes so we know where we're
[46:25] at
[46:26] what what's the great thing where we
[46:28] come from what we're doing here and
[46:30] where we're going you gotta know what
[46:31] we're doing here
[46:32] I believe we know where we came from if
[46:34] you're born again you can look back and
[46:36] see that you came from eternity the real
[46:39] you came from eternity didn't come from
[46:41] Samuel and Peggy Dale the real you came
[46:44] from eternity that's who I'm
[46:46] - and if not then it's just a sounding
[46:50] brass and a tinkling cymbal right
[46:52] because you didn't come from there that
[46:54] brother Bram said the priest had no
[46:56] representation listen Jesus came to them
[46:58] to the greatest religious order of the
[47:03] day and all they could do was call him
[47:05] belzebub and tell him that he didn't
[47:08] wash his hands for he ate a meal really
[47:12] why does your why does your master eat
[47:16] without washing his hands you see help
[47:18] just what I mean about all this stuff
[47:21] that's going on in the message that's
[47:23] just peripheral things that has no
[47:26] meaning to my salvation whatsoever it's
[47:28] a sign that it's true God give us many
[47:32] signs that he sent us a prophet but them
[47:35] signs not going to save you Jesus turned
[47:38] and looked at him one day and he said
[47:39] you seek after a sign he said you wicked
[47:42] and adulterous generation you seek after
[47:45] a sign and I'm gonna say and add to the
[47:48] word I believe it's right in between the
[47:50] lines and he looked at him and said this
[47:52] sign giver is here not to sign the sign
[47:56] giver the sign giver is who I want I
[48:00] don't want to sign the sign fine give me
[48:04] the giver I wasn't caught up in the
[48:13] cloud waiting for me but I know what
[48:16] happened after that happened that book
[48:20] got open and that Christ that was in
[48:23] that book came into my heart and your
[48:26] heart and showed us an open book if you
[48:30] can't believe that you're living under a
[48:32] closed book and it's not your time
[48:35] you're not in that third day you're not
[48:38] you're still in that 2,000 years of time
[48:40] from church age 1 through 7 we got to be
[48:43] called out of that stirring of what you
[48:50] already know about I wrote down major
[48:52] doctrines listen there was a preacher
[48:57] stood up not too long ago in a church
[48:59] and
[48:59] friend of mine was there and he was
[49:02] preaching and he said we've had enough
[49:05] teaching now we need manifestation
[49:12] totally backwards the boy ain't never
[49:17] been taught part and I know he ain't
[49:19] never senator nobody that was teacher
[49:21] cuz you can't say that you can't say
[49:26] that here we don't need teaching what do
[49:29] you mean we don't need teach him brother
[49:30] I'm said teaching pleases you in the
[49:32] body and when you learn where you are
[49:34] and what you're doing here
[49:37] then the manifestations are going to
[49:39] show my heavenly days because listen
[49:45] this bride in this the end time we
[49:47] thrive on Revelation we thrive on
[49:52] Revelation we don't if you thrive on
[49:54] Revelation first and then all these
[49:57] other things come that's wonderful but
[49:59] if you go after all these other things
[50:01] and don't get the revelation right you
[50:05] see what's going on in the message just
[50:10] say yeah number four I like sitting I'm
[50:14] just I'm just giving you some key points
[50:16] until we start into this revival I got
[50:19] some really good nuggets not tonight but
[50:21] I'm going to hold them for a little bit
[50:23] further down the road
[50:24] look 1961 expectations look now a
[50:27] minister cannot bring a revival
[50:31] there's no preacher can bring a revival
[50:34] he does that pack it with him and the
[50:39] only thing he can do is just be loyal to
[50:42] God and His Word and I believe our
[50:44] pastor has done that amen and the
[50:48] ministry has done that we brought look
[50:51] at the people we're bringing in we don't
[50:53] just call people up and say hey come
[50:54] preach know either somebody's heard that
[50:57] person before and either given this or
[51:00] this all right so we don't bring them in
[51:03] here unless we think they can help you
[51:04] I'm we we just don't have a preacher of
[51:06] the Month Club
[51:11] we're not coming from and a minister
[51:15] cannot bring a revival because he can't
[51:16] he just be loyal to God in his word and
[51:19] the revival has to come by the people
[51:21] look in your home in your life now
[51:26] listen the reason there will never be
[51:28] another worldwide revival it's a quote
[51:32] for later on but I'm going to tell you
[51:34] now the reason the Baptists can't have a
[51:37] revival they have nothing to revive you
[51:41] can't revive false doctrine how please
[51:47] somebody tell me you can't revive
[51:49] something that's dead spiritually dead
[51:52] so that's why they won't be a Baptist
[51:55] revival or a Pentecostal revival or this
[51:58] revival that it's going to be a revival
[52:00] only to the believers the ones that are
[52:02] born again because that's something to
[52:04] revive but there will not be another now
[52:07] that was a worldwide revival back in
[52:09] brother Browns time because what was he
[52:10] doing he was bringing them through out
[52:12] of that Pentecostal age and bringing
[52:14] them up into the bride age or the age
[52:17] we're talking about so he had to deal
[52:19] with the Pentecost and he had to deal
[52:20] with the Baptist he had to deal with the
[52:22] Methodists and all these different
[52:23] things and they had that revival when
[52:27] Joseph Smith when he had a revival with
[52:28] the Baptist men they toured the world
[52:30] apart
[52:30] Wesley Luther they told the world apart
[52:33] when they began a revival but what
[52:35] happened was is is they died that when
[52:39] you and remember when you die you can't
[52:41] be revived that's my brother Branham had
[52:43] to come in the end time folks and
[52:45] resurrect this whole thing I will
[52:48] restore saith the Lord he come to do a
[52:52] work of restoration
[52:53] listen Elijah and the four hundred
[52:56] prophets they beat that altar down to
[52:59] nothing remember they cut their self
[53:01] they cried they kicked what did the
[53:04] Bible say here comes Elijah no eternal
[53:09] hell no false baptism no Trinitarian
[53:15] doctrine no you can't no you can't have
[53:18] four or five wives and be a deacon you
[53:20] see what I'm talking about brother
[53:21] Branham came the
[53:22] la jeunesse end time came to restore
[53:23] worship he came to restore altar worship
[53:28] that's why Elijah when he restored that
[53:30] altar what did God do Elijah said oh
[53:34] let's pour some revival on it water his
[53:39] revival let's pour some revival on it
[53:42] about three different times three poured
[53:45] that revival on top of what God knew
[53:47] he'd come down and honored that prophet
[53:48] by consuming the water and the sacrifice
[53:51] and took it up into heaven that's what
[53:55] me and you were looking for I want God
[53:59] to take me out of here that's our
[54:04] problem we've had too much ease in Zion
[54:07] we got to CBS we got we live half of
[54:11] your cars in that parking lot cost more
[54:13] than my first house hello you think
[54:19] about that my cell phone bills more than
[54:23] my first half payment that's pitiful but
[54:29] it is so what have we come to oh let's
[54:33] go to church and if we get something we
[54:35] do if we don't yeah we'll go do
[54:37] something else
[54:39] but you got to start it it's gotta start
[54:43] in your life and start in your home now
[54:45] revival isn't adding new members to the
[54:47] church is reviving that what we've
[54:49] already got to revive means to bring
[54:53] back let's go to number five what we
[54:55] need today is an old fashioned God sent
[54:57] revival clean up the home clean up the
[55:00] heart you said you need cleaning up what
[55:03] happened in sister Sheppard's dream what
[55:06] brother Dale has been preaching about
[55:08] he's pouring the water into the barrel
[55:13] or into the box and what was coming out
[55:15] trash trash trash that we have but thank
[55:23] God once that revival got started it
[55:26] burn I pushed all that trash out and
[55:28] just wiped it away I like what one quote
[55:33] will read it when brother Branham said
[55:34] you walked out to the
[55:35] and he walked out into one of the great
[55:38] lakes and he was with a couple of
[55:40] brothers and this is how profit he's
[55:41] always in some kind of prophetic mode
[55:43] okay he walks out and and the winds
[55:46] blowing he says about 40 miles an hour
[55:48] and that Lake Superior's just doing this
[55:50] and doing this and doing this and he
[55:51] said hey brothers he said Lake Superior
[55:55] is having a revival they looked at him
[56:00] and he said yeah he said there's not no
[56:03] more water in that in that Lake then it
[56:05] was in it before the storm started he
[56:07] said but look it's pushing all the trash
[56:09] it's pushing all the trash over to the
[56:12] side it's cleaning the lake up
[56:18] let's clean our lake up when we come to
[56:25] this in time it's not gonna be a lot of
[56:26] margin of error we've had margins of
[56:30] error I'll be out of all down through
[56:31] time there is no margin of error of whom
[56:34] you know what there was no margin of
[56:36] error when Jesus stood there one day and
[56:37] he said my daddy and your dad is not the
[56:41] same looking at the religious world that
[56:45] thought that their daddy was God and
[56:48] they he looked at him he said my daddy's
[56:51] not like you my daughter
[56:52] my daddy's not even your daddy you're of
[56:55] your father the devil you know why you
[56:59] could say that because he was almighty
[57:01] good you say well what about we can't
[57:05] I've already told you
[57:06] the great revelation is is Christ in you
[57:10] the hope of glory and what God prayed
[57:13] for us in in the book of John 17 he
[57:16] prayed that prayer that we would be one
[57:19] as him in the father a one that's got to
[57:24] be a revelation we got to start saying
[57:27] what God said not what the neighbor said
[57:30] not what your not what your co-worker
[57:33] says number five believe it's down this
[57:43] what we need today is an old-fashioned
[57:45] revival I'm reading finished reading it
[57:47] plain
[57:48] if the home clean up the heart get
[57:50] things ready start a revival in your
[57:52] home and it'll begin at church preacher
[57:57] don't bring it in his briefcase God
[58:02] sends it from heaven to the individual
[58:05] now what brother Brown say this was this
[58:08] is an individual affair with God it's
[58:13] what you do
[58:15] proves who you are look at number six
[58:19] let's read number six for a quick a loss
[58:21] of the profit mothers of old they love
[58:25] to raise children but all this modern
[58:28] America day that we're living in now I
[58:30] tell you our nation is simply polluted
[58:33] there's not a hope left to this nation
[58:36] as I see only an old-fashioned revival
[58:40] and according to the scripture it'll
[58:42] never be nationwide so then we're just
[58:48] left
[58:49] it'll be a revival among the people but
[58:53] look what he brought it more narrow it's
[58:56] not just the people he brought it more
[58:58] narrow the elect of God but it won't be
[59:04] a real sweeping revival take the whole
[59:07] nation in never was never will be so
[59:12] listen there's your key if you see
[59:14] something worldwide run away from it cuz
[59:19] it ain't true
[59:20] you say well what about what about it
[59:24] brother Dale's been preaching is it's
[59:26] kind of strange has been preaching on
[59:28] anointed ones and all these things are
[59:29] coming up you know you there God listen
[59:32] they may have more signs than you do we
[59:37] may look like a ragtag bunch they may be
[59:41] getting all the healings but what are
[59:43] they preaching they take you to another
[59:45] God you're supposed to do away with it
[59:48] amen
[59:50] number seven third seal now that's what
[59:54] the reason today that the revivals not
[59:56] was supposed to that the Rivoli the
[59:59] revivals that were supposed to have
[1:00:01] we have denominational revivals we
[1:00:04] haven't had a real stirring no no no sir
[1:00:07] now look that's not the 63 we've had no
[1:00:11] stirring what and he's one of the
[1:00:14] greatest spear heads of the of the
[1:00:16] healing revival in in America and all
[1:00:18] over the world seven times around the
[1:00:20] world this is 1963 when the sales were
[1:00:22] getting ready to break of course this is
[1:00:23] his message right not the healing
[1:00:25] campaign that wasn't his message he'll
[1:00:27] tell you that not in the healing
[1:00:29] campaign but after the healing campaign
[1:00:31] the healing campaign got supposed to
[1:00:34] have got us to turn toward the hook the
[1:00:38] bait on the hook all right but a lot of
[1:00:41] us went after the bait and forgot the
[1:00:44] hook okay we have denominational
[1:00:51] revivals we haven't had a real stirring
[1:00:53] no no no no sir
[1:00:55] don't think we got revivals we haven't
[1:00:58] all they've got millions and millions
[1:01:00] and millions of church members but not a
[1:01:03] revival no where no no now listen this
[1:01:06] is your profit no revival no where the
[1:01:12] bride hasn't had a revival yet there's
[1:01:16] been no revival there no manifestation
[1:01:19] of God to stir the bride yet see we're
[1:01:24] looking for it it will take those seven
[1:01:27] unknown thunders back there to wake her
[1:01:29] up again he will send it he promised it
[1:01:35] now what is the thunders we've already
[1:01:38] been through that that's the voice of
[1:01:39] God when the seal breaks when the seal
[1:01:41] breaks we see redemption redemption of
[1:01:43] what you revelation of who we are and
[1:01:49] what we're doing here
[1:01:53] it'll take the desire of our heart to
[1:01:55] bring this it's not a desire of our
[1:01:58] heart then we'll just sit here stone
[1:02:00] cold and dead and you know what though
[1:02:02] there's going to be he will send it he
[1:02:07] promised it that's nice that the Lord
[1:02:10] come he comes from the Bible I'm not a
[1:02:13] prophet I'm not here but brother Graham
[1:02:14] said we
[1:02:15] have that staff the Lord to be quiet we
[1:02:17] would our big steel now this last bit
[1:02:24] and we're done let's go to Exodus one
[1:02:29] because remember any time there's a
[1:02:31] revival it has to be the people now
[1:02:35] we're going to talk about we really
[1:02:39] don't look at revivals but God was
[1:02:41] having a revival the day he said let
[1:02:43] there be why what was coming to pass was
[1:02:49] what was already in his mind it was
[1:02:50] coming to fruition he was having a
[1:02:52] revival listen I don't think God stood
[1:02:55] up there and just said I think I'm will
[1:02:58] have a can I have some light no he had a
[1:03:05] master plan
[1:03:07] he flung every star where he needed to
[1:03:09] be made a Sun just big enough to make us
[1:03:12] hot on this side of the world and cold
[1:03:15] on the other side when the world tells
[1:03:18] put the moon right where it's supposed
[1:03:19] to be to make the waves go in and out of
[1:03:22] the ocean the tidal wave everybody that
[1:03:26] one man the Angels didn't create
[1:03:30] anything there's only one creator sure
[1:03:34] the angels help but they only do what
[1:03:35] God tells him to Satan would have been
[1:03:39] hard if he'd have done what God told him
[1:03:40] to do but he tried to do something that
[1:03:42] God didn't tell him to do and that was
[1:03:44] interpret the word did he said right in
[1:03:47] the Garden of Eden
[1:03:48] Satan interpreted exactly what Jesus
[1:03:50] said or God said except for one word
[1:03:53] because God said thou shalt surely die
[1:03:56] he said not no no cus I'm gonna
[1:04:00] kill you you're surely not doesn't okay
[1:04:04] you your is yours bride yours people he
[1:04:08] created you he's not gonna kill you the
[1:04:13] whole human race died but we needed a
[1:04:16] savior cuz he was a savior we needed
[1:04:19] healing because he was a healer what a
[1:04:21] perfect plan but let's look at the
[1:04:23] Exodus
[1:04:23] now what happened let's set this forth
[1:04:26] now remember
[1:04:30] the children of Israel had their own
[1:04:31] property
[1:04:32] when j-20 Jacob when Joshua came across
[1:04:36] the land to give the land he divided it
[1:04:39] among the twelve tribes of Israel all
[1:04:42] right but back here in Exodus we're
[1:04:46] going to see though that those twelve
[1:04:48] patriarchs or the twelve children of
[1:04:49] Israel that's why they come
[1:04:50] listen you say watch the children of
[1:04:52] Israel over there the children of Israel
[1:04:54] is Reuben because there's rules Jacob
[1:04:58] never got changed his name to Israel the
[1:05:01] children of Israel came from them twelve
[1:05:03] tribes all right but Joseph called for
[1:05:09] the his family or his dad his brothers
[1:05:15] come over here because there's famine
[1:05:17] right remember when he reveals himself
[1:05:20] Joseph is Joseph's - real powerful God
[1:05:23] actually he can do whatever he wants to
[1:05:25] do because the the Pharaoh is just kind
[1:05:28] of like hey Joe you take over it's yours
[1:05:31] man
[1:05:32] Joseph's a perfect type of Christ
[1:05:34] because you did everything right except
[1:05:36] for one little thing and he did it to
[1:05:37] preserve life he's just so tell us a
[1:05:39] little while because of this you know to
[1:05:40] keep him getting killed but anyway that
[1:05:42] was human being Joseph is the perfect
[1:05:44] type of Christ what do you do he stands
[1:05:46] there he stands between Pharaoh and the
[1:05:49] people well everything's cool and fine
[1:05:53] until the Pharaoh dies and then Joseph
[1:05:57] dies because life only goes so long so
[1:06:02] let's start right here because what
[1:06:03] happened was when Joseph brought those
[1:06:05] children of Israel into the land of
[1:06:07] Egypt now remember that's not their
[1:06:09] property but to preserve them Joseph
[1:06:12] brought them into the land of Egypt so
[1:06:15] they could eat them seven years of the
[1:06:17] grain that hid stored because of the
[1:06:19] seven years of plenty their buddy got
[1:06:20] the story and that's the way it started
[1:06:25] they got fat the children of theirs
[1:06:29] won't eat for seven years in Egypt and
[1:06:32] just enjoyed rubbing shoulders with the
[1:06:36] world
[1:06:40] right because everything was fine they
[1:06:44] had plenty everything was going all
[1:06:47] right Joseph was their overseer and even
[1:06:50] if Pharaoh did get mad at somebody
[1:06:52] Joseph was saying I'll handle it and
[1:06:55] he'd go down and he'd handle it but
[1:06:57] watch this Exodus 1 verse 6 because
[1:07:01] brother Brown said this is one of the
[1:07:02] first revivals begun by human watch
[1:07:08] Exodus 1 verse 6 and Joseph died and all
[1:07:13] his brethren and all that generation I
[1:07:18] could say something here everybody's
[1:07:21] gone except us everybody's gone except
[1:07:28] us and the children of Israel were
[1:07:32] fruitful look and what increased
[1:07:36] abundantly man I ain't never seen some
[1:07:40] e.message churches with so many people
[1:07:41] you know and the children of Israel were
[1:07:50] fruitful and increased abundantly and
[1:07:52] multiplied and waxed exceedingly mighty
[1:07:55] why didn't have anything to do I mean be
[1:08:00] carnal they they didn't have anything to
[1:08:02] do so they just had children I mean a
[1:08:04] bundle they just get looked and waxed
[1:08:06] exceeding mighty because remember let
[1:08:08] God blessed Israel doesn't matter watch
[1:08:11] and the land was filled with them
[1:08:15] everywhere you go there's a mess message
[1:08:20] believer and there rose up a new king
[1:08:23] over Egypt wishing you not Joseph and he
[1:08:28] said unto his people now who was his
[1:08:30] people Egyptians Gentile there I mean
[1:08:34] the Egyptian people all right because
[1:08:37] he's not talking to Israel he says
[1:08:39] behold the people of the children of
[1:08:42] Israel are more and mightier than we are
[1:08:47] Pharaoh is saying look guys if we don't
[1:08:49] thin that crowd out
[1:08:53] they're gonna be a lot more of them than
[1:08:55] they are of us and they're gonna take
[1:08:56] over I'm just reading the Bible verse 10
[1:09:01] come on let us deal wisely with them
[1:09:04] unless they multiply and it come to pass
[1:09:07] that when their father out any war they
[1:09:10] join also into our enemy and fight
[1:09:13] against us and so get them up out of the
[1:09:16] land therefore they did set over them
[1:09:19] taskmasters now I don't think they just
[1:09:22] walked in one day and said alright y'all
[1:09:24] are going to work for us I think they
[1:09:26] eased then the Bible says come in with
[1:09:27] flattery they come in with these little
[1:09:29] easy sugar tit doctrines and you're okay
[1:09:32] in the message because you believe in
[1:09:33] the message don't you but then you got
[1:09:34] that at the eternal seed and you you
[1:09:36] come and sit in a message church every
[1:09:37] Sunday most of you and you do listen to
[1:09:41] every once in a while you listen to a
[1:09:42] tape if it falls if you ever hit the
[1:09:44] home button so I mean you know come on
[1:09:49] I'm giving you a tight because this is
[1:09:52] typing us they were in the greatest land
[1:09:57] there ever was and they became easy in
[1:10:01] fact and hectic but what's God fixing to
[1:10:05] do now watch
[1:10:08] therefore they did set over them
[1:10:10] taskmaster to afflict them with their
[1:10:13] burdens and they built for pharaoh
[1:10:16] treasure cities python and Remzi but the
[1:10:21] more they afflicted them the more they
[1:10:24] multiplied and grew and they were
[1:10:29] grieved because the children of Israel
[1:10:30] we didn't want Pharaoh thought he said
[1:10:32] look I'm gonna get make them so tired
[1:10:34] they ain't got nothing to do but go home
[1:10:35] and go to bed and sleep right I mean
[1:10:38] he's trying to say look we got to stop
[1:10:40] this but watch but the more they
[1:10:44] afflicted them the more they multiplied
[1:10:46] and grew and they were grieved because
[1:10:48] of the children of Israel and the
[1:10:51] Egyptians made the children of Israel to
[1:10:53] serve now with rigor now they become
[1:10:57] slaves for 400 something years they
[1:11:01] remember they were already promised to
[1:11:02] go into slavery for 400 years they're
[1:11:05] fixing their bee
[1:11:06] slaves now to the task masters of Egypt
[1:11:10] that used to be their buddies several
[1:11:12] years later before that see how Satan
[1:11:15] moves in real easy all right
[1:11:18] they made their lives bitter with hard
[1:11:21] bondage and mortar and brick and then
[1:11:24] all manner of service in the field and
[1:11:26] all their service were in they made them
[1:11:28] serve was with rigor in other words they
[1:11:31] started beating them so the children of
[1:11:33] Israel is going hold wait a minute hold
[1:11:34] on we're gonna leave this and no you're
[1:11:36] not you're ours now that's what the
[1:11:38] devil does I'm not gonna like the devil
[1:11:43] out there I'm talking to the devil here
[1:11:45] okay I want y'all to start pointing
[1:11:49] fingers everywhere else let's point them
[1:11:51] around here cuz the children of Israel
[1:11:53] the type of me in here all right and
[1:11:56] they made their lives bitter with hard
[1:11:57] bondage and mortar and brick and all
[1:11:59] manner of service in the field all their
[1:12:00] service were in they were made served
[1:12:01] was with rigor and the king of Medes
[1:12:03] that speak to the Hebrew midwives now
[1:12:05] watch now what is the Midwife supposed
[1:12:09] to do what is her job is to help birth a
[1:12:12] baby you see where we going with this
[1:12:16] the midwives were to help birth the baby
[1:12:22] watch and the king of Egypt pretty smart
[1:12:28] guy spake with the Hebrew midwives
[1:12:31] that's the first person that sees a baby
[1:12:32] born okay of which the name of the one
[1:12:38] was shift from in the name of the other
[1:12:40] in pula pure now the midwives job was to
[1:12:51] Burke the baby
[1:12:54] the preachers
[1:12:57] we're charged with birthing the babies
[1:13:02] and as we get born again Satan keeps
[1:13:07] going man I hate this I don't like this
[1:13:08] I don't like all these newborn babies
[1:13:11] coming in Christ and I don't like these
[1:13:13] people that are filling up these the
[1:13:16] real elect filling up the pews all right
[1:13:22] and he said listen watch this verse 16
[1:13:26] he's fair oh nice telling the Midwife he
[1:13:29] said when you do the office of a midwife
[1:13:31] to the Hebrew women and see them upon
[1:13:34] the stools if it be a son then you need
[1:13:37] to kill him but if it be a daughter then
[1:13:40] she shall live but the midwives feared
[1:13:44] God and stuck with a message and did not
[1:13:52] as the king of Egypt commanded them
[1:13:55] preach it brother you doing good back
[1:13:57] there okay all right but that's what the
[1:14:00] midwives feared God we've got some real
[1:14:03] message preachers that fear God and do
[1:14:06] not care what Egypt has to say I'll clap
[1:14:12] myself you clap if you won't do but the
[1:14:16] midwives feared God and did not as the
[1:14:19] king of media commanded them but saved
[1:14:21] the men children alive and the king of
[1:14:27] Egypt called for the midwives and said
[1:14:29] unto them why have you done this thing
[1:14:31] and have saved the men she must have
[1:14:33] caught wind they say with some little
[1:14:36] Hebrew babies running around that were
[1:14:38] boys because remember this sleeves up
[1:14:41] took Moses remember he's gonna throw the
[1:14:44] two-year-olds out into the crocodile's
[1:14:46] this is what leading up to it
[1:14:48] and the myth but remember there was this
[1:14:52] is talking about a lot of babies but
[1:14:54] when God comes down to save and he saved
[1:14:56] Moses one elect he saved one exciting
[1:15:03] way with me and you and the king of
[1:15:06] Egypt called for the midwives sooner
[1:15:07] then why have you done this thing and
[1:15:08] have saved the men children a lot
[1:15:10] and the Midwife said unto Pharaoh
[1:15:11] because the Hebrew women are not as the
[1:15:15] world
[1:15:16] man I bet how to shout and fit when I
[1:15:19] saw this yesterday for their loudly some
[1:15:23] of y'all please be alive Lee loudly
[1:15:28] they're lively and are delivered even
[1:15:31] when the midwives not there therefore
[1:15:43] God dealt well with the midwives and the
[1:15:47] people multiply then waxed very mighty
[1:15:51] the elect of God will always find a way
[1:15:54] to make you three always because they're
[1:15:57] God's elect
[1:15:59] you know what election is what's an
[1:16:02] election a vote for and a vote against
[1:16:07] God voted for you
[1:16:09] Satan voted against you who swings to
[1:16:12] vote you do you swing to vote you're the
[1:16:17] two-to-one one way or the other right
[1:16:18] that's your free moral agency but oh my
[1:16:21] when I read I thought man those midwives
[1:16:23] they said these people are so strong and
[1:16:27] don't say they don't need us anymore
[1:16:28] don't get don't get that in your head
[1:16:30] that you don't need the ministry anymore
[1:16:32] but it come to a place to where those
[1:16:35] meant the babies the wives that were
[1:16:37] producing the babies we're so strong
[1:16:41] nothing stopped them and that's the same
[1:16:45] thing with me and you but see after this
[1:16:47] right here Pharaoh said all right take
[1:16:52] every baby that's to you every man child
[1:16:54] is two years old and under and throw
[1:16:55] them in the Nile and the alligators are
[1:16:58] going to eat them that's when the people
[1:17:00] started crying for a deliverer that's
[1:17:04] when the first revival of the Prophet
[1:17:06] tells us of a group of people crying out
[1:17:09] to God for a deliverer so that's the
[1:17:13] same way with you now cry out for a
[1:17:16] deliverer you say we've already been
[1:17:19] delivered you had been delivered from
[1:17:20] this yet
[1:17:21] I want to be delivered from a wretched
[1:17:25] man that I am right here this is a man I
[1:17:29] want to get delivered from love the Lord
[1:17:37] let me just give you one more little
[1:17:40] tidbit of information we're done there
[1:17:43] was five great revivals coming up from
[1:17:46] the 1700s and we'll talk about this a
[1:17:47] little bit later because I want to show
[1:17:48] you what the you said well I don't know
[1:17:51] about I don't know why how I need to act
[1:17:53] in a revival well I'll show you next
[1:17:55] Sunday or Sunday after there was five
[1:17:59] great revivals one was between 1972 the
[1:18:02] 1917 32 the 1740s started in England
[1:18:06] well that happened to be John Wesley all
[1:18:09] right Second Great Awakening was from
[1:18:10] the 1820s to 1850s you brought in
[1:18:13] Charles Finney you brought in Moody and
[1:18:17] all those different ones the
[1:18:18] third-grader waiting for us from 1875 to
[1:18:20] 1885 I'm sorry that is when that is when
[1:18:24] you bring Dwight Moody in in after the
[1:18:27] 1850s but if you'll watch most of these
[1:18:30] great awakenings happened after a major
[1:18:33] war or during a major war because the
[1:18:37] people got scared but like I said before
[1:18:42] the first great revival in the 1730's
[1:18:45] here's the commentary churches relax in
[1:18:48] their requirements for church
[1:18:50] participation and membership it called
[1:18:54] it was called the halfway covenant it
[1:18:58] allowed children of non believing
[1:19:00] parents to still be baptized in good
[1:19:02] faith that they'd be reared with the
[1:19:04] morals of the church people started
[1:19:06] crying out against that and God brought
[1:19:08] a revival anytime you see error that's
[1:19:11] when you cry out for a revival or when
[1:19:14] you see a war now we've it we've been in
[1:19:16] spiritual wars but most of these this is
[1:19:18] a street revival was from 1906 to 1915
[1:19:21] well that's when the First World War was
[1:19:24] alright and then you got the 20th
[1:19:27] century revival which was 1910 to the
[1:19:29] 1970s which you see Billy Graham Billy
[1:19:31] Sunday they don't release brother
[1:19:33] branham but I put him in there is
[1:19:35] what from 1910 to 1970 in 1940 you had
[1:19:39] war so you got different things coming
[1:19:40] up now we've got spiritual wars that
[1:19:42] we're dealing with all right we got to
[1:19:44] all those different things but I'll read
[1:19:45] that later on but that's how and I'll
[1:19:46] tell you how each one reacted because it
[1:19:49] was a reaction of the people for what
[1:19:51] was going on around them that's what's
[1:19:53] got to happen to me and you something's
[1:19:55] got to stir us the bride does better
[1:19:57] under persecution we've not been
[1:20:01] persecuted the only persecution we got
[1:20:03] is standing number six in line at
[1:20:05] Walmart hello somebody you don't have to
[1:20:12] do that now if you do self checkout look
[1:20:14] how that world's done got self this and
[1:20:15] self-doubt now you can do self checkout
[1:20:17] let's stand to our feet musicians come I
[1:20:27] want to read you a couple of quotes they
[1:20:29] don't have but I will read them again
[1:20:32] and I just want to make a comment while
[1:20:34] they're coming in light of all the
[1:20:36] things that's been going on the past few
[1:20:37] weeks in different months and all the
[1:20:39] mm-hmm this is just my take on this
[1:20:42] watch this i brother bob you sent me
[1:20:44] that already had that because i just
[1:20:46] went through the adoption series from
[1:20:48] brother Dale was preaching the doffing
[1:20:49] series but watch what brother Bram said
[1:20:50] in light of all these things that's
[1:20:52] going on I want us to keep our mouths
[1:20:53] shut don't ask us what's going on don't
[1:21:00] ask somebody else what's going you ain't
[1:21:01] nothing but a bunch of nosy people leave
[1:21:04] it alone
[1:21:05] I do know what's going on brother Joel
[1:21:07] Forney gave me a good idea of everything
[1:21:09] that was going on and I spoke to him
[1:21:11] Monday - and he's going through a battle
[1:21:13] and we need to pray for him but you
[1:21:15] listen to this and 1960 brother Brown
[1:21:17] said an adoption series I went after a
[1:21:20] brother not long ago had one astray a
[1:21:23] young fella said to me let that Roscoe
[1:21:26] go let him alone he said if I ever get
[1:21:30] to the place that my heart don't go with
[1:21:34] my brother then it's time for me to go
[1:21:36] to the altar because I've fallen from
[1:21:41] grace I said I'll go as long as he's got
[1:21:44] breath in his body and I'll catch him
[1:21:46] somewhere along the line
[1:21:50] yes sir and I called him hallelujah
[1:21:53] brought him back but I want you to watch
[1:21:55] what this listen to this statement yes
[1:21:57] sir he's back in the fold safely now yes
[1:22:00] sir
[1:22:01] he'd have went astray it sure is the
[1:22:04] world so if brother Brown hadn't
[1:22:06] intervened he would have just kept going
[1:22:08] so I hope and pray that we don't do like
[1:22:11] what's going on in the and I say stupid
[1:22:14] people because I'm telling you what
[1:22:18] ain't nothin but a witch hunt we need to
[1:22:21] pray for people that's the only thing
[1:22:23] that's gonna help gossip ain't gonna
[1:22:24] help praying for people is gonna help
[1:22:26] pray for the people that are affected
[1:22:29] cuz listen brother Branham even tells us
[1:22:32] in what should we do with Jesus called
[1:22:33] Christ this is where he talks about
[1:22:34] Matthew 24 verse 21 through 26 what
[1:22:37] brother Dale is preaching on the false
[1:22:39] Christ's coming he says look he
[1:22:42] predicted that spirit in this system
[1:22:43] would be so much like the real thing til
[1:22:45] it would deceive the very elect if it
[1:22:46] were possible the elected we were just
[1:22:48] talking about the elect whose names are
[1:22:50] put on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[1:22:52] the foundation of the world and frankly
[1:22:54] it got them so tied up until he said if
[1:22:57] he didn't cut the work short for their
[1:22:59] sake there would be no flesh saved upon
[1:23:02] this earth that's we'll wrap folks this
[1:23:05] is the long battle long battle and like
[1:23:09] I said we've got soldiers that have
[1:23:10] fallen on either side I say soldiers cuz
[1:23:14] I don't it's not for me to pick and
[1:23:15] choose it's for us to pray and if we can
[1:23:18] ever catch somebody to bring them back
[1:23:20] all what a great thing instead of doing
[1:23:22] like most preachers are doing now the
[1:23:24] idiots are up there condemning these
[1:23:26] people and and dividing churches and
[1:23:28] it's not for here it's not for us each
[1:23:31] church sovereign but I just want to tell
[1:23:33] you that cuz I heard some of the stuff
[1:23:35] going on different things it's none of
[1:23:36] our business
[1:23:37] none of it brother joe fornear needs
[1:23:40] prayer brother Tim hymns need prayer and
[1:23:41] the whole congregation needs prayer they
[1:23:45] need a revival but maybe it'll start in
[1:23:48] this revival right that will pray what
[1:23:54] you bear to keep your eye open because
[1:23:55] Satan's out but when Satan comes in like
[1:23:59] a flood the Spirit of Lord
[1:24:02] we'll raise up a standard and to me that
[1:24:05] standard is renewing what we've already
[1:24:08] got start a revival in your home go home
[1:24:12] and throw stuff out you don't need pray
[1:24:20] a little more
[1:24:22] read your Bible a little more listen to
[1:24:27] a message a little more I'm just asking
[1:24:29] if we can do that as individuals come to
[1:24:32] church for some people don't come half
[1:24:35] the time I'm sorry but if a house of God
[1:24:38] doors is open brother Bram said a
[1:24:39] born-again person cannot wait for those
[1:24:42] doors to open that has not changed
[1:24:44] oh yeah it's changed you know why
[1:24:47] because Egypt says it's changed oh well
[1:24:51] we're okay we watched it online I may
[1:24:53] have just a little sniffle or my cat's
[1:24:54] probably got diarrhea I think I'll stay
[1:24:56] home no fight your way to church fight
[1:25:01] your way through everything
[1:25:03] quit being lacks all of us I'm talking
[1:25:06] about me to stop being lacks have a
[1:25:11] revival you know what you can have a
[1:25:14] revival and nobody besides you'll even
[1:25:16] know it but you know what sometimes that
[1:25:22] pressure gets old fall maybe it'll burst
[1:25:27] open one of these days and somebody you
[1:25:28] that's never said any man will say Amen
[1:25:30] or if you never lifted your hands to God

[1:25:34] not lifting your hands your neighbor you
[1:25:35] live in your hands to God you know what
[1:25:37] it is surrender and most of the time you
[1:25:41] know what this is not surrender if you

[1:25:46] you to put your hands up if you don't
[1:25:50] put your hands up you have not
