[0:37] he's wanting to show you and talk about
[0:40] the miracle baby then we will have the
[0:42] baby dedication all right all right
[0:49] good afternoon everybody
[0:52] this may take a while
[0:53] get comfortable
[0:56] i'm gonna actually uh thank you
[0:59] i'm gonna set my
[1:01] stopwatch okay
[1:03] to stop me at a certain point because i
[1:05] don't want to go too long
[1:07] i'm glad to have my family here with me
[1:08] before i forget cake downstairs after
[1:11] service
[1:12] do not leave without eating some cake we
[1:14] don't want to take it home
[1:16] i'm so glad to have all my family if i
[1:17] could just take a moment to introduce
[1:19] them
[1:20] uh
[1:21] starting over here on the right my
[1:22] grandmother
[1:24] uh ginger bonnet beside her is my dad
[1:27] joel and my sister brooke
[1:30] and then me conor juan carlos rolica
[1:32] mentosa nicaragua
[1:36] and my two nieces and i and aleah and
[1:38] then uh let's see my mom back there
[1:41] behind my dad there and my grandma my
[1:43] other grandma
[1:45] marlene my mom is deborah sorry
[1:48] and then over here
[1:50] uncle bill where'd they go oh they moved
[1:52] uncle bill and aunt susan dover
[1:54] now let me tell y'all something
[1:56] that's
[1:58] important to me that i thought of when
[1:59] they walked in
[2:00] my grandma and my aunt suzanne
[2:03] are children of my great-grandmother
[2:05] eula who you all know my baby is named
[2:07] after
[2:08] they left eula and floyd night they left
[2:10] a legacy of godly christian love
[2:13] and that's part of the reason i'm
[2:14] standing here today
[2:16] is because the bible says it's one
[2:18] simple law in god's word
[2:21] that train up a child in the way he
[2:22] should go when he's old he'll not depart
[2:24] from it
[2:25] they train their children to pray and
[2:27] they pass it down to the next generation
[2:29] my dad and mom taught me to pray and my
[2:31] grandma prayed with me and my sister and
[2:33] read our bibles
[2:34] and she read her bible with us
[2:36] and that's she's part of this testimony
[2:38] if it weren't for that i wouldn't i
[2:39] don't know if i'd be here so um
[2:42] i wanted to give that to them now
[2:45] i'm trying to make sure i don't leave
[2:46] anything out
[2:48] um thank you all so much for your
[2:51] prayers about iva god did something
[2:53] tremendous i mean not just healing her
[2:56] but delivering me from fear
[2:58] and so many other things that i want you
[3:00] to see in this testimony and i hope it
[3:02] can be a help to somebody sorry that you
[3:04] didn't know all the circumstances most
[3:05] of you didn't know she was dying frankly
[3:07] i didn't want to think about it i didn't
[3:08] want to tell anybody i didn't want to
[3:10] confess it
[3:12] and like brother dale says you don't
[3:14] have to know the circumstances that
[3:15] somebody's facing to know how to pray
[3:17] just pray you don't pray hard if they're
[3:19] dying and pray soft if they got a cold
[3:21] just pray
[3:22] and brother gary atkins sister mary
[3:24] daugherty they're on my heart
[3:26] everybody's hearts i'm sure we keep
[3:28] lifting them up we don't know exactly
[3:29] what they're facing to every detail but
[3:32] we just pray now
[3:33] iva was born premature as most of you
[3:35] know she had underdeveloped lungs that
[3:37] was the initial diagnosis
[3:40] and
[3:41] she got worse and worse and worse over
[3:42] the first few days by the third day she
[3:44] was in critical condition on life
[3:46] support heavily medicated heavily
[3:48] sedated
[3:50] in a medically induced coma
[3:52] and under constant supervision from a
[3:54] nurse not one to two but i mean one to
[3:57] one ratio a nurse constantly watching
[3:58] just our baby that's how bad she was
[4:00] constantly working diligently to get her
[4:02] stable by the third day
[4:04] now
[4:07] by that time all through this trial
[4:08] scriptures kept coming to my remembrance
[4:11] because he said he'd make a way of
[4:12] escape in the trial and the word is the
[4:14] way of escape you always go back to the
[4:16] word when jesus was tempted
[4:18] he always went back to the word
[4:20] he said it is written it is written it
[4:21] is written and that's how we overcome
[4:24] now by the third day i was under a
[4:26] tremendous load of fear
[4:28] not the good kind of fear the reverent
[4:30] fear for god but the
[4:32] torment fear
[4:33] now the bible says fear hath torment
[4:36] and that scripture came to my
[4:37] remembrance and i told gabby you know
[4:39] gabby we've got to overcome this fear by
[4:41] this time i was
[4:43] crying okay because of the fear i was so
[4:45] scared for losing my baby
[4:48] now that was god speaking to me and i
[4:49] didn't know yet i thought it was just
[4:51] another good scripture to come for me
[4:53] and later that day we were at our dying
[4:54] baby's bedside and she by this time her
[4:56] skin was pale
[4:58] she was cold and clammy her fingers and
[5:00] toes were beginning to turn purple and
[5:01] blue
[5:03] her oxygen saturation at the lowest
[5:05] point that night got down to 37 percent
[5:07] it's supposed to be between 90 and 100
[5:09] percent hers got down to 37 percent
[5:12] she was in terrible shape
[5:15] nonetheless
[5:16] there was a bible study here that night
[5:17] we left our dying baby's bedside against
[5:20] all rational thought
[5:21] i'm not saying this to brag i'm saying
[5:23] that that i stood because i saw
[5:25] something in the bible that having done
[5:27] all to stand we stand and to me standing
[5:29] is reading your bible praying going to
[5:31] church diligently living to serve god
[5:33] and believing
[5:35] so we left our dying baby's bedside that
[5:38] night or that afternoon and went to
[5:39] church cried all the way here cried all
[5:41] during this they're in the bible study
[5:43] and most of you know this part of the
[5:44] testimony because i testified a few
[5:46] weeks ago by the way it approached me
[5:47] after the service
[5:49] not presumptuously
[5:51] holding his head down ringing his hands
[5:53] you know ryan will keep praying for it
[5:55] maybe everything will be okay no he came
[5:57] to me and spoke boldly
[5:59] and said these words and simplicity
[6:02] he said he smiled and said
[6:04] don't worry stop worrying
[6:07] quit worrying like that
[6:09] about three times then he went on to say
[6:10] some other things
[6:11] and
[6:13] i accepted that okay that was the net
[6:15] result but he doesn't know this
[6:17] but when he spoke that to me a battle
[6:19] began to rage in my mind
[6:21] because that oppressive spirit of fear
[6:24] was beginning to it was confronted by
[6:26] faith
[6:28] perfect love cast without fear if you
[6:30] can read that on the scripture there
[6:32] perfect love which is faith casteth out
[6:34] fear that's how you overcome fear
[6:37] that confronted that fear and the fear
[6:38] began to be afraid itself because it was
[6:40] being loosed now watch
[6:42] i didn't know this until later on
[6:43] because
[6:44] weeks later after this it all passed i
[6:46] didn't realize what was going on
[6:48] but i pondered these things i kept these
[6:50] things in my heart like mary and i began
[6:51] to think on these things and god began
[6:53] to show me some of what was going on
[6:55] behind the veil of the flesh if you will
[6:58] that fear was confronted by faith the
[7:00] first thought that came to my mind
[7:01] brother wade
[7:02] was how dare you stand there and tell me
[7:04] not to worry when my baby's laying in
[7:06] bed dying
[7:07] i wasn't mad at him because he didn't
[7:08] know she was dying see but that was the
[7:10] first thought but what about my baby
[7:12] laying in the bed dying and you're just
[7:13] telling me something so simple just
[7:14] don't worry
[7:17] like jesus said fear not
[7:18] only believe don't doubt
[7:22] and
[7:22] i went to mark 4 38 later on that
[7:25] scripture came to my remembrance
[7:27] y'all can read it while i'm talking but
[7:29] just for sake of time
[7:30] the jesus and the disciples were in us
[7:32] in the sea in the boat at sea being
[7:34] tossed about by the winds and the waves
[7:36] and the disciples through a spirit of
[7:37] fear went to wake jesus because he was
[7:39] asleep there was no fear in that man
[7:42] he laid there sleeping
[7:44] and in the midst of the trial in the
[7:46] midst of the storm he laid there asleep
[7:48] not worrying one bit but the disciples
[7:50] through fear went to wake him and said
[7:52] carries thou not that we perish
[7:54] in other words don't you care about my
[7:55] baby laying there dying
[7:58] see the same spirit acting the same way
[7:59] pointing to the circumstances just the
[8:02] same way false evidence appearing real
[8:05] fear
[8:06] pointed me back to the circumstances and
[8:08] then
[8:09] for a moment i thought yeah my baby's
[8:11] dying but this is faith
[8:13] this gives me hope
[8:15] this gives me peace and joy so i'm going
[8:16] to take what brother wade gave me
[8:19] and you know jesus awoke and rebuked the
[8:22] winds and the waves and the winds and
[8:23] waves ceased
[8:24] and then he addressed the spirit of fear
[8:26] in the disciples he said unto them why
[8:28] are you fearful how is it that you have
[8:29] no faith
[8:31] okay
[8:32] so that same spirit of fear was doing
[8:33] the same thing in me i realized that
[8:35] only later now
[8:38] um that night we went home went to bed i
[8:42] felt so much more encouraged i wasn't i
[8:43] didn't cry anymore after that
[8:45] in the middle of the night
[8:47] the worst wasn't over yet okay
[8:49] that was the turning point but not not
[8:50] just yet okay that god gave me something
[8:52] he was in the middle of giving me
[8:53] something to overcome
[8:55] the greatest battle was just ahead in
[8:57] the middle of the night the doctor
[8:58] called and said ryan your baby's not
[8:59] getting any better she's she's getting
[9:00] worse and we're going to send her down
[9:02] to eggleston children's hospital in
[9:04] atlanta and the children's health care
[9:05] of atlanta where she can get some more
[9:07] advanced care
[9:08] so we went down there to meet the doctor
[9:09] in the middle of the night and while
[9:11] waiting to meet the doctor i pulled up
[9:12] my bible and began to read
[9:15] despite my baby dying despite her having
[9:17] to be moved in the middle of the night
[9:18] which shows she must been pretty bad
[9:21] and despite being a one-hour sleep i
[9:23] just pulled out my bible began to read
[9:25] as i did the day before that and the day
[9:26] before that the day before that i
[9:27] refused to stop my daily bible reading
[9:31] and you know what
[9:32] the very
[9:33] chapter that contained that very verse
[9:36] is the one that i read
[9:38] in my daily bible reading now i go one
[9:40] chapter day out of the new testament two
[9:42] out of the old testament and just to
[9:43] show you how unlikely this is i look
[9:45] this up on google there's 260 chapters
[9:46] in the new testament so it's a one in
[9:48] 260 chance that this would happen
[9:51] that i would read that very verse
[9:54] now god was speaking to me and i began
[9:55] to realize that the bible says three as
[9:56] a witness the previous day fear hath
[9:58] torment came to my remembrance just out
[10:00] of the blue
[10:01] then that night brother wade spoke to me
[10:03] don't fear don't worry and then in the
[10:05] middle of the night in my bible reading
[10:07] waiting to hear the verdict from the
[10:08] doctor about my baby there came that
[10:10] scripture again and i turned to gabby
[10:11] and said gabby look at this
[10:12] i said god is speaking to us
[10:14] god is showing us do not worry no matter
[10:16] what
[10:18] do not fear
[10:19] now this is beautiful let me show you
[10:21] the next slide please
[10:23] psalm 23 later again i realized we were
[10:25] walking right down the middle of psalm
[10:27] 23.
[10:28] yea though i walked through the valley
[10:29] of the shadow of death
[10:30] gabby and i collectively don't cry
[10:32] gambian it's going to make me cry
[10:36] yeah i mean i collectively and
[10:38] individually we're in the worst trial of
[10:39] our lives the deepest valley
[10:42] yet
[10:44] and my baby was shadowed to death yet i
[10:46] will fear no evil that was david's
[10:48] proclamation or declaration and that was
[10:50] my mandate god told me don't fear what
[10:52] would be evil my baby dying it put her
[10:55] in the presence of god it'd be wonderful
[10:56] for her but for me it'd be terrible i'd
[10:58] never know what she'd become this side
[10:59] of eternity i'd never know what color i
[11:00] should have what color hair she'd have
[11:02] everybody agree with me that'd be pretty
[11:03] evil i will fear no evil for thou art
[11:06] with me thy rod and my staff they come
[11:08] for me now he was an ever-present help
[11:10] just as he always is and bringing the
[11:11] word from my memories give me scriptures
[11:13] to overcome and to comfort and
[11:16] everything
[11:18] and my favorite part
[11:20] i never understood what this meant thou
[11:21] prepares the table before me in the
[11:23] midst of mine enemies
[11:25] what were david's enemies here fear and
[11:27] death what were our enemies fear and
[11:29] death our baby was dying we were afraid
[11:32] fear and death the last
[11:33] enemy to be defeated is death the bible
[11:35] says fear and death were our enemies
[11:38] okay
[11:39] now
[11:40] god didn't wait till they were at bay
[11:42] somewhere off bothering somebody else
[11:44] and sneak in and slide us a little manna
[11:46] under the table so to speak
[11:48] god's not afraid of fear and he's not
[11:49] afraid of death right
[11:51] he walks in waltzes in right in the
[11:52] middle of fear and death right in the
[11:53] presence of our enemies and opened the
[11:55] table before me and gave me exactly what
[11:58] i needed to overcome this very trial at
[12:00] this very moment
[12:03] they opened the table before me
[12:05] and on that table was not a seven course
[12:07] meal it was one little morsel of bread
[12:10] he was saying here son you're going to
[12:11] need this for the battle that lays just
[12:12] ahead right because he knew what that
[12:14] doctor was going to tell us when she
[12:15] walked into the room
[12:18] and that morsel of bread was this
[12:20] that fear had torment and no matter what
[12:22] the outcome of your trial you will never
[12:24] be benefited by fear so cast it down
[12:26] it's a disease it's a spiritual disease
[12:28] that only dr jesus can diagnose you with
[12:30] okay like depression which i've also
[12:32] overcome years ago
[12:34] now
[12:35] he waltzes into the room and gave me
[12:37] that little morsel of bread and no
[12:38] sooner than i had
[12:40] read that scripture and understood what
[12:42] was going on that the doctor walked into
[12:44] the room
[12:44] and she sat down
[12:46] and this was a real surreal moment
[12:49] she looked me in the eye and i wished at
[12:51] this point that i could be just a
[12:52] bystander watching her talk to somebody
[12:54] else about their baby
[12:55] but she looked me in the eye and was
[12:57] talking to me about my baby and said
[13:00] your baby is dying
[13:04] and we have a treatment here we can give
[13:05] her called ecmo which is a lung bypass
[13:07] machine we'll take and cut her jugular
[13:09] vein
[13:10] send this tube down her jugular vein
[13:12] into her heart
[13:13] to draw the blood out and circulate it
[13:14] through a machine
[13:16] and put oxygen in it because the lungs
[13:17] were not doing that
[13:19] and put it back into her jugular vein
[13:21] and thus get oxygenated blood to her
[13:23] body
[13:24] because if we don't do that soon she
[13:26] said she'll start having brain damage
[13:27] and before too long she's going to die
[13:29] her body's going to start shutting down
[13:30] and there'll be no hope for her lungs
[13:32] then
[13:33] but this would give her time her lungs
[13:34] time to heal
[13:36] so she said uh and we'll leave her on
[13:38] that machine for up to two weeks and if
[13:39] she's not even better we'll take her off
[13:40] and let her go because she's not gonna
[13:42] make it if she hasn't made it in two
[13:43] weeks
[13:44] gabby was bawling by this time
[13:46] and i was trembling like i've never
[13:47] shaken before under that load of fear it
[13:50] was like a lion roaring in my face
[13:52] because satan is a roaring lion roamer
[13:54] to and fro and seeketh whom he may
[13:55] devour
[13:57] and that fear was just roaring at me and
[13:59] yet this little still small voice
[14:01] be not afraid
[14:03] don't doubt
[14:04] it is not
[14:06] be not afraid
[14:09] that little still small voice kept
[14:10] speaking
[14:11] kept echoing through my mind
[14:15] and
[14:16] so the doctor said uh
[14:18] we're gonna hold off a little bit
[14:19] because she's stable right now
[14:22] so we walked out of there and went to be
[14:23] at our bedside at her bedside and
[14:25] watched her for about four hours we sat
[14:26] there from 2 30 to 6 30 sunday morning
[14:29] and
[14:31] they still hadn't done the ecmo so we
[14:33] left we told them we'll see y'all this
[14:34] afternoon we're going to church
[14:36] it was sunday morning
[14:37] so we came here and i testified about
[14:39] that very thing that if anytime you're
[14:41] in a trial at the end of the trial you
[14:43] will never look back and be glad for the
[14:44] worry and say boy i'm glad i worried i'm
[14:46] glad i feared because that's what got me
[14:48] through that's when i realized that see
[14:51] and
[14:52] that's what i testified about and then i
[14:54] only made one confession about ibis i
[14:56] still didn't know if she was going to
[14:57] make it but i knew i had to overcome the
[14:58] fear either way
[15:00] so i simply confessed i said y'all pray
[15:02] for ava she's she's fine just keep
[15:04] praying for her
[15:05] and at that moment as far as i knew she
[15:07] might have already been dead or dying or
[15:09] already on the ecmo machine
[15:11] well we left church
[15:12] and headed back down there that day
[15:14] and called the nurse on the way down and
[15:16] i said is she on ecmo yet is she on the
[15:18] long bypass yet
[15:20] and the nurse said no she's she's
[15:22] actually getting better
[15:24] and from that hour she began to man she
[15:26] got better and better and better every
[15:27] day she stayed there all together for 30
[15:30] days in the nicu okay getting better
[15:32] each day
[15:33] now here's the wonderful part about all
[15:35] this this is something that nobody knows
[15:36] but me and god
[15:38] i haven't even told gabby this because i
[15:39] wanted to give god all the praise before
[15:41] all you at one time
[15:42] and if after i say this if you're not
[15:44] praising god i'm going to step outside
[15:46] and look at the rocks on the church to
[15:47] see if they're actually praising god
[15:51] okay because this is wonderful i shouted
[15:52] over this in the chicken truck
[15:54] now
[15:57] there were four nurses the first four
[15:58] nurses that i've had at eggleston
[16:02] were named kathy katie kate and caitlin
[16:05] because i mean i called called them
[16:07] every day if we weren't there to ask
[16:08] them okay that's how i remember kathy
[16:10] katie kate and katelyn pretty much
[16:12] different variations of all the same
[16:13] name right
[16:14] so i said hmm something significant here
[16:16] i didn't know what i texted it out to
[16:18] several people brooke texted me back
[16:19] said that name means pure
[16:21] p-u-r-e and i thought that's neat sounds
[16:24] pretty two days later
[16:26] it finally struck me what that means
[16:29] look up pure it means untainted it means
[16:31] free from disease free from ill
[16:34] see god he works through nurses he works
[16:36] through doctors he works through
[16:37] medicine but god is the healer god was
[16:39] beginning to purify our baby from the
[16:41] severe lung disease beginning to draw it
[16:42] out of her because that was her
[16:43] diagnosis by this time was severe lung
[16:45] disease he was cleansing her and why
[16:48] four because three is a witness three
[16:49] would have got our attention
[16:51] but there were four of them
[16:53] don't get ahead of me
[16:56] now
[16:57] he's already got me figured out i'm sure
[16:59] four is god's number of deliverance in
[17:00] the bible the children of israel were
[17:02] 400 years in the land of egypt in
[17:04] bondage when they were delivered
[17:06] lazarus was four days in the grave when
[17:08] jesus resurrected him and delivered him
[17:09] from death
[17:11] and
[17:13] the children of israel i'm sorry let's
[17:15] see the hebrew children there you go he
[17:17] mentioned this one the three hebrew
[17:18] children in the fiery furnace
[17:20] uh and the fourth man seen in that fire
[17:23] was their deliverer
[17:25] okay four is god's number of deliverance
[17:26] through four nurses whose name means
[17:29] pure which is a four letter word god was
[17:32] beginning to purify her baby and cleanse
[17:34] her from the sickness and watch this
[17:36] she was born she was delivered from the
[17:38] womb if you will at four minutes
[17:40] till midnight
[17:42] and by the way a side note that was the
[17:44] best delivery best that gabby's done so
[17:46] far everything went so smoothly i
[17:47] believe the other midwives were anointed
[17:49] but this time more than ever because i
[17:51] stand there praying you know i have to
[17:52] believe it
[17:53] and
[17:55] four minutes till midnight is when she
[17:56] was born she went into the nicu just a
[17:58] couple hours later and all day saturday
[18:01] all day sunday excuse me all day
[18:03] thursday friday and saturday she got
[18:06] worse worse and worse
[18:08] and saturday night she was at the point
[18:09] of death
[18:10] but on the fourth day
[18:12] which was sunday the resurrection day of
[18:14] the day we honor and celebrate the
[18:16] resurrection
[18:17] god began to raise her
[18:19] and heal her from that sickness
[18:24] and i'm not done
[18:26] she's our fourth child
[18:28] and you know god delivered me from fear
[18:32] on her fourth child
[18:35] and
[18:36] she has a four letter name i have
[18:39] her middle name is a four letter name
[18:40] june
[18:42] now watch this
[18:46] what was the next thing i didn't write
[18:47] any of this down i just practiced it a
[18:49] lot
[18:50] four and four okay
[18:52] and
[18:54] uh my now plum forgot it it'll come to
[18:57] me
[18:59] four and four all the four is in her
[19:01] name now watch
[19:03] she is her name means
[19:06] uh god is gracious did i say that at the
[19:08] start of it i don't remember god is
[19:09] gracious is what ava's name means it's a
[19:11] hebrew name god is gracious and all
[19:14] through this trial god was gracious not
[19:15] only to deliver me but gracious to
[19:17] deliver her from the sickness
[19:20] god's grace was manifested over and over
[19:22] and over
[19:23] and um
[19:26] and those just so many other things just
[19:28] one thing after another i'm trying to
[19:30] jog my memory because there was four i
[19:32] know there was another four in there
[19:33] uh but god was
[19:35] gracious and let it be said of iva from
[19:38] this day forward whenever you think of
[19:39] iva
[19:40] remember that god is gracious to to
[19:43] deliver god's grace is sufficient to
[19:45] deliver
[19:47] okay and um
[19:50] if i remember that other thing i'll just
[19:51] have to come back up and say it later
[19:52] oh yeah here it is oh it's a big one
[19:54] hang on
[19:56] this is a big one
[19:57] see any time god gives you something the
[19:59] devil makes you doubt it
[20:01] so immediately after this the dog's
[20:02] making me down and i said okay big boy
[20:03] we'll see you come the next trial we'll
[20:05] find out
[20:06] if i got delivered from fear or not
[20:09] the next trial came a couple weeks later
[20:10] as last sunday morning brother quinn was
[20:12] preaching
[20:13] eula laid there on her back asleep
[20:16] and gabby and the girls were in the
[20:18] bathroom and uh the devil thought this
[20:20] pretty good opportunity to sneak in and
[20:22] cause some mischief caused some trouble
[20:24] i was holding either my hands were tied
[20:26] okay
[20:26] and eula was laying there on her back
[20:28] asleep and her arms began to flail like
[20:30] this
[20:31] about once every second with her
[20:32] heartbeat you know
[20:34] and
[20:35] she was asleep now i thought maybe it's
[20:37] just a nightmare but it'll just go away
[20:39] but no she kept doing it and then i
[20:41] noticed she's not breathing
[20:42] so i went up to raise her up she was
[20:43] just as limp as could be
[20:45] not breathing
[20:47] she opened her eyes and her eyelids okay
[20:49] and her eyes were rolled back in her
[20:50] head she was having a febrile seizure
[20:52] her seizure had spiked it was up to
[20:53] 103.5 and she was not breathing
[20:57] now i just all i did i handed off the
[20:59] baby to terrence and and took eula
[21:01] picked her up and carried her out and
[21:02] said lord bless my baby and no sooner
[21:04] than i did that that she coughed all
[21:06] that out and she began to breathe
[21:08] and it was in just within moments the
[21:09] brother aaron and a whole host of other
[21:11] people and our two of our church staff
[21:13] nurses were out there assessing her
[21:15] people are surrounding us with prayer
[21:16] and praise
[21:18] and it wasn't too long after that she
[21:19] came out of that and she's perfectly
[21:21] normal and well right now but here's the
[21:23] thing i didn't fear
[21:31] i just simply went and picked her up and
[21:32] acted i just prayed and carried her out
[21:34] and said lord if you take my baby

[28:05] the baby dedication
[28:07] so you want to
[28:09] go ahead and bring up
[28:11] the little one
[28:12] and we always do here come up with the
[28:15] parents the grandparents and great
[28:17] grandparents the whole family
[28:20] and uncles
[28:21] is any ants come on with it
[28:24] bring the whole fantasy
[28:26] she's wanting you back here
[28:35] let's just sing
[28:38] bring them in while they're getting
[28:39] everything ready okay
[28:41] bring them
[28:47] bring the little ones to jesus
[28:54] bring them in
[29:10] bring them in
[29:13] bring the
[29:15] little ones together
[29:18] jesus
[29:19] bring them in
[29:23] bring them here
[29:33] amen and amen amen
[29:36] that's what we do
[29:37] we bring the little ones to jesus
[29:41] you know a lot of churches they do
[29:43] different things
[29:44] but
[29:45] remember in the scripture they brought
[29:47] the
[29:48] little children that's right
[29:50] to jesus and he blessed
[29:52] them right
[29:55] it's not a thing that we call it a
[29:56] baptism or anything
[29:58] it's just the basis that we bring them
[30:00] to the lord
[30:01] we hand them into the hands of the lord
[30:05] and ask
[30:06] the lord to take care of him that's
[30:07] right
[30:08] he's been gracious to have done all so
[30:11] far
[30:12] so we know he'll finish the day
[30:14] but how do we also do
[30:17] we also do one thing the family
[30:20] standing
[30:23] see when we come to a baby dedication
[30:24] it's a little bit different i guess than
[30:27] most people and like i said it's not an
[30:29] infant doing things it's not a
[30:31] saying or saved or anything it's just
[30:33] we've come to dedicate them to the lord
[30:36] give them into the hands of the lord and
[30:38] then you know what
[30:40] they would take them to jesus he'd bless
[30:41] them he'd give them right back to them
[30:43] because you know who raised the children
[30:45] jesus didn't raise the children
[30:47] it was the people the ones around that
[30:50] raised right and we always say even to
[30:52] the church
[30:54] that everybody in this church today is a
[30:58] people that are dedicated to one thing
[31:01] for you to live a life that this child
[31:06] would have an opportunity
[31:08] to be able to see jesus christ
[31:12] that's the point of all of it
[31:14] the whole thing is the dedicating right
[31:16] but the dedicating of the people
[31:18] that are a witness to all of it that's
[31:20] right that now we're to live before this
[31:22] child
[31:24] to where the child could have an
[31:25] opportunity of seeing jesus christ
[31:29] that's all we try to do and that's what
[31:31] we try to bring them to the to the lord
[31:54] everybody
[32:02] father
[32:04] we bring little iva jim
[32:07] to you lord
[32:10] family brother dedicated to you
[32:14] it's not me standing here in the basis
[32:16] of
[32:18] anything it's just what we're planning
[32:19] to do
[32:21] if you was here you would take the child
[32:23] and you hold it up and you just
[32:25] bless it
[32:27] then you give back to the family for
[32:29] them to live
[32:30] god
[32:31] take care of it
[32:33] you raise the child for your honor
[32:36] we thank you father that we've had this
[32:38] opportunity to be a part of this
[32:41] be a part of seeing the family standing
[32:43] here
[32:44] but they realize that a miracle yes has
[32:47] transpired
[32:49] in all of their life
[32:51] that they can see that you brought a
[32:53] baby
[32:56] even the doctor said he couldn't live
[32:58] because you dropped it to the basis
[33:01] that now it's
[33:04] in your hands
[33:05] we just commit little obviously
[33:09] we believe we thank you
[33:11] in jesus name
[33:13] now lord we give her back to the man
[33:16] for them to raise yes we love you and we
[33:19] thank
[33:23] a little you
[33:26] a little bundle of joy
[33:29] think of all of the
[33:31] the little ones
[33:32] and we've dedicated all of these little
[33:34] ones
[33:35] each one's had their opportunity to be
[33:38] dedicated amen
[33:45] what do you mean
[33:51] when you were praying for her and i was
[33:53] taking the picture and you said the word
[33:54] near her she raised her hand

[40:53] amen so this is only one word amen
[40:57] it's about headship amen amen
[41:02] so
[41:03] when we talk about headship we believe
[41:05] that there is only one head and that's
[41:07] christ
[41:10] and he has a
[41:12] uh he has a pattern
[41:15] uh
[41:16] as we read again in another scripture in
[41:18] ephesians 5 23
[41:20] he said for the husband is the head of
[41:23] the wife
[41:24] even as christ
[41:26] is the head of the church
[41:28] and he is the savior
[41:31] of the body
[41:32] amen so i believe that that makes him
[41:35] that makes him head of the body
[41:39] because
[41:40] his sacrifice
[41:42] even he redeemed the body
[41:45] and that makes the body submissive to
[41:49] the head
[41:50] because she recognized her position
[41:52] amen so there's no way for
[41:55] there's no way for
[41:56] when we go back to the garden of eden
[41:58] there's there was no way for eve
[42:01] to get back
[42:03] amen because
[42:04] that uh
[42:06] that relationship that contact with the
[42:09] serpent
[42:10] you know put a separating line right
[42:14] between the woman and the man
[42:17] and uh we see that
[42:19] uh
[42:22] after the fall
[42:24] that was
[42:26] the time when the woman had her name he
[42:29] was she was named eve right
[42:32] after the fall
[42:33] prior to the fall
[42:35] amen she was called woman
[42:37] amen so i believe that's the same thing
[42:40] today when all churches have their own
[42:42] names
[42:44] that's after the fall
[42:46] amen but prior to all these
[42:48] denominations and religious group and uh
[42:52] you see it was only called church
[42:54] amen and that's the church of the living
[42:56] god and
[42:57] and if you call church of the living god
[42:59] there's no separation in it
[43:01] you cannot divide the body of the lord
[43:03] jesus christ amen but all these you know
[43:06] thousands of denominations have
[43:09] put so much lines you know that that we
[43:11] have come to a point today that when you
[43:14] ask a person are you a christian they
[43:16] will answer i'm a baptist
[43:19] you know you ask a person a christian
[43:21] are you a christian amen well i'm a
[43:23] catholic
[43:24] amen and and that puts you know a a
[43:27] separating line
[43:28] amen because of the name
[43:30] amen be and and its name uh uh
[43:34] uh is being followed by uh by by by
[43:38] divisive doctrines and theologies and
[43:41] creams amen
[43:42] but god has only one head
[43:46] all right and he only has one body
[43:49] and uh so that's the same thing that's
[43:51] why even in the homes
[43:53] he established
[43:55] the hardship of the husband
[43:57] it says he poor the husband in the head
[43:59] is the head of the wife and nobody can
[44:01] change that
[44:02] it is god's program
[44:05] and the same thing and the same thing we
[44:08] we don't allow not because we don't want
[44:11] it
[44:12] but the bible says amen
[44:14] a woman cannot be
[44:16] a head of a church
[44:18] amen she cannot stand behind the pulpit
[44:21] thieves and something it's not allowed
[44:22] by the bible because you see it it
[44:26] it speaks also of the headship
[44:29] amen because the pastor is the head of
[44:32] the church the local congregation nobody
[44:34] can nobody can change that and god hates
[44:38] a
[44:39] perverted relationship
[44:41] amen so you see
[44:43] christ is the head he's the bridegroom
[44:45] the church is the bride the wife amen so
[44:49] the wife amen uh
[44:51] uh
[44:52] she has a husband so the relationship is
[44:55] husband and wife it is man and woman
[44:57] it's male and female see but you see
[45:01] well uh
[45:02] people allow this thing but when you see
[45:04] when somebody a woman standing here
[45:07] amen being the head of the church so
[45:09] then you you have a spiritual perverted
[45:12] relationship because you turn a woman
[45:15] with woman
[45:16] amen so that's that's not the right
[45:18] relationship that's not the right uh
[45:20] uh uh uh program of god okay so we talk
[45:24] about headship amen so
[45:27] uh
[45:28] uh being the head that's why with the
[45:30] testimony that we
[45:32] uh that we hear and the lot of various
[45:35] things you know he being the head always
[45:39] proves
[45:40] amen himself
[45:41] that he is the savior of the body he's
[45:44] the redeemer of the body he's the
[45:46] provider of the body just like the
[45:48] father must be the provider amen just
[45:51] like the pastor who provides and feed
[45:53] his flock amen and by the way it's not
[45:56] his plaque but it is god's flaw amen so
[45:58] that's why that was the instruction
[46:00] given by jesus christ himself amen to
[46:04] peter amen do you love me then feed my
[46:06] flock amen you know feed my lambs so you
[46:09] see it's it's uh
[46:11] the man must always be the provider
[46:15] amen so i'm not i'm not against women uh
[46:19] working if that's needed you know and uh
[46:22] but but it remains that the handshake
[46:24] must come you know from the lord jesus
[46:26] christ the same thing with the household
[46:28] which is the uh uh but but just
[46:32] just uh for us to have some kind of a
[46:34] springboard here
[46:35] but let me uh again allow me to to to
[46:39] read a statement from the message
[46:41] proving his word
[46:44] you see in paragraph 211 let me read
[46:47] this
[46:48] it says here
[46:50] he was in defeat in luther
[46:54] in the thighs in wesley
[46:57] in the shoulders in pentecost right see
[47:00] what i mean he is the head
[47:03] you have a part that joins that together
[47:06] this hour that we're living now
[47:09] not the feet part
[47:11] not the thai part
[47:13] not the shoulder part but the neck part
[47:16] right amen so we are we are in that
[47:19] position so uh
[47:20] if we understand you know some submit to
[47:23] these people some uh uh protestant
[47:25] people they they tend to misunderstood
[47:27] that that we disagree with them but
[47:29] somehow there are some points amen
[47:31] because there's truth in them
[47:34] amen for some time right
[47:36] okay
[47:37] but if we recognize
[47:39] amen in luther's time
[47:42] he was in the feet part
[47:44] which was the foundation of reformation
[47:47] amen so and i believe that was that was
[47:50] actually the start of restoration
[47:53] okay so they were reformers then
[47:55] amen so god was not finished in the time
[47:58] of luther
[48:00] uh
[48:01] so it moved on the light moved on amen
[48:03] in the thighs in wesley so he's coming
[48:05] up and then and this is building up the
[48:08] body of jesus christ
[48:09] and then in wesley in the shoulders in
[48:12] pentacles
[48:13] where the gibbs amen
[48:15] were being restored amen people started
[48:18] to see vision recognizing the the gifts
[48:21] amen but but the gift was we're only
[48:24] representation of the giver
[48:26] amen but praise god we come to a point
[48:29] that those gifts only represent the
[48:31] giver amen but we know that at this
[48:33] point in time
[48:34] amen it's not the the blessings that we
[48:36] seek only but the blesser himself
[48:40] it's not the gifts only but it's the
[48:42] giver himself amen so but to receive
[48:45] that there must come to a point amen and
[48:47] we see the stature of a perfect man here
[48:50] amen that we're it looks like we're go
[48:52] going into the ladders taping you know
[48:54] from faith virtue knowledge amen
[48:57] temperance patience brotherly kindness
[49:00] godliness brotherly kindness so all
[49:02] these things must be built up together
[49:05] amen and and brings the new birth
[49:08] amen and and and so you see amen we're
[49:11] no longer in the shoulder part not the
[49:14] thai part not the shoulder part but the
[49:16] neck part
[49:18] amen right there and there's a
[49:20] connection amen so
[49:22] uh
[49:24] we cannot connect you know we cannot
[49:26] connect the head in the thigh it doesn't
[49:28] look good amen
[49:31] we cannot connect the head to the feet
[49:33] it doesn't look good amen it must be
[49:35] connected to the neck
[49:38] and that is the hour that we are living
[49:40] in right amen so we have come to a point
[49:43] that the the the messenger of god have
[49:45] come to tie uh uh the loose ends amen so
[49:49] amen we have come to that point so
[49:52] all these things
[49:54] today that's why we see in this first
[49:56] chronicles
[49:58] we see that all these men of war they
[50:00] are not ordinary men
[50:03] they were men they were leaders
[50:05] they were they were warriors and if we
[50:08] go up and read you know we can see
[50:11] uh things maybe uh we can read few parts
[50:14] here in verse 31
[50:16] it says and of the half of tribe of
[50:18] manasseh 18 000
[50:20] which were expressed by name to come and
[50:23] make david king
[50:25] and of the children of issachar which
[50:27] were men
[50:28] that had understanding of the times so
[50:31] now you come to a point of various
[50:34] gifts in the body
[50:36] amen so
[50:37] you have people here they were menopause
[50:40] they're good you know they're good in
[50:42] instruments they were good in uh uh in
[50:45] in weapons amen and then you have come
[50:48] to this point the people children of
[50:50] isakar which were men that had
[50:52] understanding of the times maybe you can
[50:55] they can look up and see those stars are
[50:57] being lined up and they they can
[50:59] interpret they can see what what what
[51:01] will come to pass what will take place
[51:03] and they can locate where they are
[51:05] because they can understand amen so
[51:08] there are gifts in the body like that to
[51:11] know what israelis ought to do the heads
[51:13] of them were 200 and all their brethren
[51:16] were of their commandment
[51:18] of zebulun such as went forth to battle
[51:21] expert in war
[51:22] amen so uh these are different group of
[51:26] people amen uh they're men and they're
[51:28] not just uh uh war people they were
[51:31] experts
[51:34] with all instruments of war fifty
[51:36] thousand which could keep rank they were
[51:38] not of double heart
[51:40] of zebulun such as wentworth to battle
[51:42] i'm sorry thirty-four and of napoli a
[51:45] thousand captains and with them with
[51:47] shield and spear thirty and seven
[51:49] thousand
[51:50] and of the dynamics expert in war twenty
[51:52] and eight thousand and six hundred and
[51:54] of us such as went for to battle expert
[51:57] in war forty thousand and on the other
[52:00] side of jordan of the rubinites and the
[52:02] gaddites and half of tribe of manasseh
[52:05] with all manner of instruments of war
[52:07] for the battle a hundred and twenty
[52:09] thousand all these men aboard
[52:12] amen all these men of war that could
[52:14] keep rank came with a perfect heart to
[52:17] web run to make david king
[52:20] over all israel and all the rest also of
[52:23] israel were of one heart to make david
[52:27] king right i believe amen if we you know
[52:30] try just trying to imagine trying to
[52:32] imagine i mean that all the people that
[52:35] were of one heart
[52:37] and their intention was only to live
[52:40] king david
[52:42] that was the natural king
[52:44] and in if that natural thing
[52:46] amen happened here
[52:49] on earth
[52:50] amen
[52:52] i believe with the w with the leadership
[52:54] of the holy spirit
[52:56] that only if all the people should have
[52:59] one
[53:00] heart
[53:02] one motive
[53:03] one desire
[53:05] amen and that is to make jesus christ
[53:08] king
[53:09] of all kings
[53:11] amen not to make somebody bigger than
[53:13] the other right not to build a kingdom
[53:16] that is more powerful than the other
[53:17] kingdom amen not to make known just like
[53:20] what job did and we read this morning
[53:23] and then he had the opportunity to make
[53:26] a name for himself but he did not took
[53:28] that opportunity he did not take and and
[53:31] credit for himself amen but he wanted
[53:34] king david to be
[53:36] present and to take the crown of the
[53:39] other king amen so that's the same thing
[53:41] today the body of the lord jesus christ
[53:44] must come to this same point
[53:47] amen to bring up christ
[53:49] and the bible said and i if i be lifted
[53:52] up from the earth i will draw all men
[53:55] unto me hallelujah so this is our
[53:59] intention this is our desire
[54:01] hallelujah now let me just
[54:03] read another scripture in matthew
[54:05] chapter 8 if you would follow me
[54:07] and if we can put it in the bimmer in
[54:10] matthew 8 18 to 20 20 20
[54:14] 18 now
[54:15] when jesus saw great multitudes about
[54:18] him
[54:19] he gave commandment to depart and to the
[54:22] other side
[54:24] and a certain scribe came and said unto
[54:26] him master
[54:28] i will follow thee
[54:29] with whosoever thou goest
[54:32] and jesus said unto him the foxes have
[54:34] holes
[54:36] and the birds of the air have nests
[54:38] but the son of man had not where
[54:41] to lay his head
[54:43] amen now we
[54:44] you know most of the time he myself i
[54:47] use this scripture to show how jesus
[54:51] during his time during his ministry
[54:53] suffered a lot
[54:55] talking about poverty he did
[54:57] he did suffering
[54:59] amen
[55:00] going to the mission
[55:02] barrowing horse
[55:04] even borrowing both
[55:07] just to be on the other side
[55:09] amen uh reaching out poor people
[55:12] amen presenting them the kingdom of god
[55:14] talking about the poverty amen he did
[55:16] suffer all these things
[55:21] but
[55:22] if we look at this scripture
[55:26] i see
[55:27] more than natural
[55:29] things on this
[55:32] because in verse 18
[55:34] now when jesus saw great multitudes
[55:37] about him he gave commandment to depart
[55:39] on the other side and a certain scribe
[55:42] came and said unto him master i will
[55:44] follow thee
[55:46] so this scribe was looking for a leader
[55:51] that he had to follow
[55:53] somebody that could lead him
[55:56] amen
[55:58] and
[55:58] in verse 20 jesus said unto him the
[56:01] faxes have holes
[56:03] and the birds of the air have nests but
[56:05] the son of man had no where to lay he
[56:07] said and if we continue on down low if
[56:09] you would allow me we can see the
[56:11] scripture
[56:12] that there was a man who wanted to
[56:14] follow jesus but but he he had something
[56:16] to do because he had to bury somebody
[56:19] amen
[56:20] so i believe this is more than just
[56:24] poverty
[56:26] but this is hardship
[56:28] when jesus said foxes have holes and the
[56:31] birds of their
[56:32] and the birds of the air have nest but
[56:34] the son of man had not where to lay his
[56:37] head
[56:38] because birds you know when they get
[56:40] tired they go back to where they will
[56:42] lay they had nest
[56:44] faxes they had holes
[56:46] to rest
[56:47] amen but notice that jesus
[56:50] he came to his own
[56:52] and his own received him not
[56:55] right
[56:57] he came to the time
[56:59] when people
[57:01] were religious
[57:04] and those scriptures there
[57:06] the most holy city supposedly
[57:09] they supposedly the most holy people
[57:13] people of god
[57:16] crucified
[57:20] four words also
[57:23] there they crucified him
[57:26] the most shameful death
[57:29] was given to him
[57:31] the king of glory amen glory amen why
[57:35] because he was the rejected king right
[57:38] right
[57:39] he was supposed to be the head of all
[57:41] religion
[57:43] but the most religious people
[57:46] amen at that time when he came 2 000
[57:48] years ago amen he was supposed to be the
[57:51] head
[57:52] amen but the son of man
[57:55] had nowhere to lay his head right amen
[58:00] amen
[58:01] so but praise god amen after 2 000 years
[58:07] after two thousand years since then and
[58:10] then he looked
[58:12] for the bride right amen and every time
[58:14] we're going to see that you know joseph
[58:17] types the lord jesus christ joseph had
[58:19] the gentile bride
[58:21] amen moses had the gentile bride
[58:24] amen so the same thing jesus christ look
[58:27] for a gentile bride amen because he came
[58:30] to his own and his own received them not
[58:32] and what a blessing what an amazing
[58:35] grace amen that we as a people that were
[58:39] like dogs
[58:40] in those days
[58:42] amen what a privileged people we are now
[58:45] amen simply because we accepted him to
[58:49] be the head
[58:50] amen of our generation we accepted him
[58:53] to be a man of the headship of the body
[58:57] and we are part of that body hallelujah
[58:59] so two thousand years ago jesus had said
[59:02] pastor
[59:06] but the sun had no nothing to lay his
[59:08] head on amen but
[59:11] today jesus could say
[59:13] amen foxes and balls birds of nests and
[59:17] also
[59:19] amen and also the son of man
[59:22] has a neck
[59:28] amen
[59:29] because eliza has found rebecca for
[59:33] isaac amen thank you lord and if we see
[59:36] amen the beauty of all these things we
[59:39] see how god has extended
[59:42] his grace to be able to reach us there's
[59:46] no amount of words
[59:48] on our side you know to be able to
[59:50] explain god's grace
[59:53] there is not much
[59:56] space in my mind in my brains even in my
[59:59] heart to comprehend
[1:00:02] how the grace of god had worked in me
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:05] amen he's been so gracious and with that
[1:00:08] kind of experience where when
[1:00:10] when there seems to be time where we can
[1:00:13] say
[1:00:14] it's hopeless and and and everything
[1:00:17] seemed to be
[1:00:18] uh out of range
[1:00:20] amen but
[1:00:22] when we cannot
[1:00:24] hold on to something anymore
[1:00:27] then we find out god is there amen
[1:00:29] we can do everything
[1:00:31] amen but it has a limitation but somehow
[1:00:34] when we get to a point that that's the
[1:00:37] end of the line and then we cast
[1:00:39] everything into his hand
[1:00:41] hallelujah then god will be working
[1:00:44] right amen when when when when when we
[1:00:46] are trying to lead ourselves head
[1:00:48] ourselves that you know
[1:00:50] as if we're saying
[1:00:52] lord i can do
[1:00:54] something amen but the only thing that
[1:00:57] we can do all things is only through
[1:01:00] christ
[1:01:01] amen so we have many uh many experiences
[1:01:04] amen we have many things uh that have
[1:01:06] happened simply because we recognize him
[1:01:09] being the head of our lives
[1:01:11] hallelujah so i believe it's not only me
[1:01:14] amen it's not
[1:01:16] only one in in this means
[1:01:18] that since we take jesus christ being
[1:01:22] the head
[1:01:23] of our lives
[1:01:25] everything have changed
[1:01:27] everything has everything you know it's
[1:01:29] never been the same again
[1:01:32] i could relate with with our precious
[1:01:34] brother this morning
[1:01:35] we were confronted with that kind of uh
[1:01:38] uh
[1:01:40] situation before
[1:01:42] uh just a little testimony just to keep
[1:01:45] the flow
[1:01:46] how god you know how god really worked
[1:01:49] even in the times when we really cast
[1:01:51] everything upon him
[1:01:53] amen you know i was i was also given a
[1:01:56] sickly child my uh my elder
[1:02:00] uh my eldest son i believe
[1:02:02] i have
[1:02:03] testified something on this previously
[1:02:05] but it just
[1:02:06] uh
[1:02:07] get back on my mind you know about the
[1:02:09] goodness of the lord she was he was also
[1:02:12] found with a congenital heart disease
[1:02:14] when he was three months old and he
[1:02:17] needed to undergo major surgery and not
[1:02:20] only certain single surgery it must be
[1:02:22] two surgeries i mean they had to cut his
[1:02:24] side you know to put a artificial vein
[1:02:28] because as he was growing the vein was
[1:02:30] not growing and the uh
[1:02:32] oxygen uh supplied by by through the
[1:02:36] blood is not enough for his uh pc uh
[1:02:39] body demand you know and
[1:02:42] uh uh
[1:02:43] and in the philippines you know when you
[1:02:45] talk about surgery it you know it's
[1:02:47] beyond rich
[1:02:49] amen of your financial capacity and at
[1:02:51] that time i was i was working as a
[1:02:55] public school teacher
[1:02:57] and then just to cut the story short you
[1:03:00] know so so three months old
[1:03:02] and uh
[1:03:03] uh
[1:03:04] for three years you know
[1:03:07] my my my uh our baby you know he will
[1:03:10] turn black
[1:03:11] because he was a blue baby
[1:03:14] you know his uh
[1:03:16] nails
[1:03:17] are violet his lips violet his eyes are
[1:03:20] red you know you see and from time to
[1:03:23] time he just collapsed you know
[1:03:25] but the lord really delivered him
[1:03:28] you know because uh the doctors could
[1:03:30] not believe you know how he was able to
[1:03:34] to survive three years without having a
[1:03:36] stroke with those uh
[1:03:38] numbers a number of of uh uh collapse
[1:03:42] you know
[1:03:42] but when he was three years old uh he he
[1:03:46] was in the surgery
[1:03:48] he had the surgery
[1:03:50] and
[1:03:51] and
[1:03:53] then after which
[1:03:56] the doctor said you know we're not sure
[1:03:58] if he can make it here because his body
[1:04:00] is so weak and he he if he makes it then
[1:04:04] we will be expecting another surgery for
[1:04:06] another year
[1:04:08] and uh so
[1:04:10] uh
[1:04:11] but by that time you know we also had a
[1:04:13] baby girl and this baby girl was so
[1:04:15] healthy very beautiful amen but suddenly
[1:04:18] because we were watching our baby boy
[1:04:22] uh our baby girl who was nine months old
[1:04:25] and got sick and in just a matter of two
[1:04:27] weeks you know
[1:04:28] uh
[1:04:30] the lord took her
[1:04:32] and just before that you know i i was
[1:04:34] because i i was really
[1:04:36] at the brink of the ministry and at that
[1:04:38] time uh
[1:04:40] i was having some promotion in my in my
[1:04:42] job i was promoted as a master master
[1:04:46] teacher in the school
[1:04:48] and there's a possibility to being
[1:04:50] promoted to a higher position i was
[1:04:52] intending to to be in that position also
[1:04:55] and i never had any intention in making
[1:04:57] it to the ministry and my wife didn't
[1:04:59] want it also because my wife uh
[1:05:03] she's a daughter of i'm sorry she's the
[1:05:06] daughter of one of the pioneer ministers
[1:05:08] in the message in the philippines
[1:05:13] and
[1:05:14] she said i'm against for you to be a
[1:05:17] minister because you know i grew up as a
[1:05:19] as a child of a minister and it's not
[1:05:22] easy all eyes are looking at you you
[1:05:25] know you have to you have to everything
[1:05:27] you do must be good must be right you
[1:05:29] must be friendly to everybody you know
[1:05:37] and i saw you know i saw my mother you
[1:05:40] know
[1:05:41] and i don't want to be a minister's wife
[1:05:45] amen
[1:05:46] and so we agreed
[1:05:48] amen but during those days this is what
[1:05:51] what we were telling you just like when
[1:05:53] david when he was out of the position
[1:05:55] when he was supposed to be doing
[1:05:57] something
[1:05:59] amen to fulfill his commission to
[1:06:01] fulfill his position amen
[1:06:04] just like jonah we see a lot of things
[1:06:07] that you you you cannot get by with it
[1:06:10] you get con
[1:06:11] you suffer the consequence and the
[1:06:14] people that are close to you are being
[1:06:16] affected also amen and and you know it
[1:06:19] was so sad and and and when when when
[1:06:22] our baby was just right there in icu and
[1:06:24] i was raising my hand i was in in
[1:06:27] desperation and i said lord please don't
[1:06:30] take our baby girl because she she might
[1:06:33] she will be the one to take care of her
[1:06:35] you know brother when they you see
[1:06:38] but god is absolute you know
[1:06:43] so
[1:06:44] it looks like our
[1:06:46] requests were not granted
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:51] but even then now we were left with a
[1:06:53] child
[1:06:54] that is sick and and had to undergo two
[1:06:56] major surgeries
[1:06:58] amen but then
[1:07:01] we come to a point
[1:07:04] that god put us in the corner that we
[1:07:06] had nothing to do but to raise our hand
[1:07:09] you know
[1:07:10] god can just let you go as far
[1:07:13] amen god can just let you go as far
[1:07:17] but
[1:07:18] when when his time comes
[1:07:21] amen
[1:07:22] he's going to pull you
[1:07:25] amen and just do
[1:07:26] and you'll just going to you you'll be
[1:07:29] in one corner and just going to say lord
[1:07:32] i'm here
[1:07:34] and so by that time you were just right
[1:07:36] there and and my wife and myself we held
[1:07:38] hands together and we just pray amen
[1:07:41] perhaps we have to do something
[1:07:43] amen god has been dealing with us i knew
[1:07:47] that call is there but we're just
[1:07:49] running with it because of our
[1:07:51] you know our reasons
[1:07:54] amen but somehow probably the lord is
[1:07:56] talking to us and if we agree no matter
[1:07:58] what we're going to serve him i'm
[1:08:00] willing to serve and preach this gospel
[1:08:03] preach this message no matter what
[1:08:05] and so when i handed my my my child to
[1:08:09] to the surgeon and i said lord i'm
[1:08:11] giving my child to you
[1:08:13] amen
[1:08:14] it's up to you lord but let me tell you
[1:08:16] something lord
[1:08:18] whatever happens
[1:08:20] i'm going to serve you
[1:08:22] glory
[1:08:26] brothers let me tell you this the doctor
[1:08:28] said amen
[1:08:31] he will have a poor memory
[1:08:35] and he had to undergo neck surgery the
[1:08:38] following year but it took us three
[1:08:40] years
[1:08:41] and the doctor were mad at us you know
[1:08:44] you don't love your uh baby boy you know
[1:08:47] you don't want him to have this second
[1:08:49] surgery which is needed we want to do it
[1:08:52] amen but it's just that we cannot have
[1:08:55] anything to pay
[1:08:57] you know but you see
[1:08:59] you know but god we know god is in
[1:09:01] control
[1:09:02] glory amen and we believe god you know
[1:09:05] if this boy
[1:09:06] you gave this boy to us and then you're
[1:09:09] going to do something you're going to
[1:09:10] save him you're going to spare him
[1:09:12] remember you're going
[1:09:14] he needed to be uh to to undergo that
[1:09:16] next surgery which which they call the
[1:09:18] total correction then he will be there
[1:09:21] and you will provide
[1:09:22] and it took us three years
[1:09:24] and the doctor said you know
[1:09:27] it must be in this first year the
[1:09:29] following year
[1:09:32] and second year it will it will not be
[1:09:33] possible for him
[1:09:35] you know he might have you know stroke
[1:09:37] or something get worse and it's not
[1:09:39] possible for him to stay three years
[1:09:42] amen but to their surprise because they
[1:09:45] were thinking how come because that uh
[1:09:48] that little artificial vein that they
[1:09:50] put in would not reach
[1:09:52] three years for him to survive to
[1:09:53] provide him enough oxygen amen but you
[1:09:56] know what happened because of the
[1:09:58] prayers of the saints amen we prayed and
[1:10:01] we committed to the lord amen and and
[1:10:04] and the people were praying and then
[1:10:05] when they when they tried to to look at
[1:10:08] their uh at his uh heart amen you know
[1:10:12] they they compared they compared their
[1:10:15] first
[1:10:16] uh uh uh you know x-ray or something to
[1:10:18] the latest x-ray and you know what they
[1:10:21] found out
[1:10:22] they found out that there is
[1:10:24] uh that there is a natural vein that
[1:10:27] grew
[1:10:32] you know god knows how to do it
[1:10:35] amen god knows how to do it and and by
[1:10:38] that you know we were comforted by god
[1:10:40] simply because amen we accepted him as
[1:10:44] the head amen and he is going he knows
[1:10:47] he knows best
[1:10:49] he knows better than we think
[1:10:51] amen and so by then and today my son is
[1:10:55] 23 years old
[1:11:00] amen
[1:11:01] and i'm pushing and i'm pushing him and
[1:11:03] i'm pushing him come on get away for you
[1:11:06] you need to have a family and give me
[1:11:07] grandchildren
[1:11:11] and you know the the uh my boy said you
[1:11:14] know he will have a poor memory but he
[1:11:16] is an id and he's good in coding amen
[1:11:23] he do websites and he do programs
[1:11:25] softwares and everything amen you cannot
[1:11:28] outdo god
[1:11:32] amen and so all these things and now i
[1:11:35] cannot i cannot
[1:11:37] i cannot complain
[1:11:38] i cannot question god and the only thing
[1:11:41] that that i can do is that lord god you
[1:11:44] put me here you are my head amen it's up
[1:11:47] to you whatever right
[1:11:49] hallelujah right and so these things
[1:11:52] amen you know we're not being bothered
[1:11:54] because we are we are in our rightful
[1:11:57] position
[1:11:58] amen because he is the head he knows
[1:12:01] right
[1:12:02] amen and this head one time in john
[1:12:04] chapter 27 it's not in the
[1:12:06] uh
[1:12:07] but i know you know the scripture when
[1:12:08] he said you know nobody can pluck us out
[1:12:12] of his hands
[1:12:14] amen so when we are in our right pool
[1:12:16] position he being the head
[1:12:19] and he is the one taking full control of
[1:12:21] us nobody can take us out of his hand
[1:12:24] amen and the only way the only way we
[1:12:27] can we can be in his hand
[1:12:30] you remember you know he is the same
[1:12:33] that is walking in the midst of the
[1:12:34] seven golden candlesticks
[1:12:37] amen and in the midst of those seven
[1:12:39] gandalf sticks in the book of revelation
[1:12:41] amen he was right he was in in his hand
[1:12:44] he had in his hands seven stars
[1:12:47] amen
[1:12:48] and in the seven stars
[1:12:52] i see myself being identified without
[1:12:55] with one of those stars
[1:12:57] and as long
[1:12:59] as as i stay
[1:13:01] amen with the message of that star which
[1:13:04] is in his right hand nobody can take me
[1:13:07] out of his hand
[1:13:08] hallelujah so there are seven stars
[1:13:10] through the ages
[1:13:12] even through the ages and then he kept
[1:13:15] watching his bride
[1:13:17] he kept watching and he's watching us he
[1:13:19] was watching me right at the perfect
[1:13:21] time where i am going to come in
[1:13:24] hallelujah
[1:13:25] you know even even in the parables we
[1:13:27] see in the parable of that good
[1:13:29] samaritan
[1:13:30] we see how in the back of god's mind
[1:13:33] if we look back in that in that parable
[1:13:36] we see amen that that you know there are
[1:13:39] many uh many preaching sermons today
[1:13:42] that we they can only see that good
[1:13:44] samaritan as far as a good man in the
[1:13:47] neighborhood
[1:13:50] that if you help your neighbor you're a
[1:13:52] good samaritan
[1:13:55] well there's nothing against that which
[1:13:57] is true
[1:13:58] because that's the only the spirit of
[1:13:59] the samaritan in you amen but if we're
[1:14:02] going to look at it amen by message
[1:14:06] point of view we see amen we see amen
[1:14:09] that that man
[1:14:11] that was being robbed in jericho is not
[1:14:14] a man
[1:14:15] naturally born in jericho
[1:14:18] right right that man in jericho he came
[1:14:22] from jerusalem
[1:14:25] down to jericho
[1:14:27] amen so that means he had an origin
[1:14:30] he came down from jerusalem to jericho
[1:14:34] amen
[1:14:35] and this good samaritan
[1:14:38] came where he was
[1:14:41] so that means he came where he was
[1:14:44] so this man in jericho is a citizen of
[1:14:47] jerusalem
[1:14:49] and this good samaritan that came from
[1:14:51] jerusalem also and notice that these two
[1:14:54] religious people the levite and the
[1:14:57] priest amen they just came around
[1:15:01] by chance
[1:15:03] amen it's by chance
[1:15:05] they see this man in jericho
[1:15:08] but this good samaritan it's not by
[1:15:10] chance
[1:15:11] the bible said amen as he journeyed
[1:15:15] right that means he's so
[1:15:18] definitely specific in his thought
[1:15:21] at the back of his head he knew this
[1:15:25] good samaritan of mine
[1:15:27] he knew why
[1:15:28] he was going down to jericho
[1:15:31] because he's going to pick up that man
[1:15:33] in jericho because he does not belong to
[1:15:36] jericho he is a citizen of jerusalem
[1:15:40] amen so he is in the mind of god
[1:15:43] so i see myself in this condition we
[1:15:46] were in the mind of god
[1:15:48] amen we were we were in that in god's
[1:15:51] mind we were attributes then i mean
[1:15:54] because we were in the head we were in
[1:15:56] the back of god's mind amen god is
[1:15:59] always responsible
[1:16:02] god is always responsible for us
[1:16:05] that's why the same thing as he was
[1:16:06] walking in that you know he when he was
[1:16:09] walking that uh uh seven golden
[1:16:11] candlesticks in throughout his his
[1:16:14] throughout history
[1:16:15] amen he is responsible
[1:16:18] that's why in this good samaritan you
[1:16:19] know when he pick up that man and then
[1:16:22] he poured in oil and wine amen which is
[1:16:25] the stimulation of revelation
[1:16:27] amen and the next thing which i like the
[1:16:29] portion that i like there and then when
[1:16:32] he when he picked up that man
[1:16:35] and he laid him in his own beast
[1:16:38] hallelujah
[1:16:40] he laid him in his own best
[1:16:43] and throughout all the ages we messaged
[1:16:46] believers amen in the first four seals
[1:16:48] we see in every seal that is being
[1:16:51] opened
[1:16:52] amen there is a a a a horse that is
[1:16:55] coming out amen the white amen the red
[1:16:58] the black and in the late the the last
[1:17:01] one was the pale horse but every time
[1:17:04] there is a beast also that god has sent
[1:17:08] forth amen from from that amen those
[1:17:11] those throne guards amen in heaven were
[1:17:13] being released and then here on earth to
[1:17:16] bring up to bring inspiration and to
[1:17:19] anoint his people
[1:17:21] amen and those are the beasts amen so
[1:17:23] the first beast was the lion so in the
[1:17:26] first
[1:17:27] part you know this good samaritan place
[1:17:29] us in his own beast amen that's why the
[1:17:32] the believers in those days they were
[1:17:34] like lions
[1:17:36] amen they were so brave and courageous
[1:17:38] enough amen and they they test whether
[1:17:41] uh uh everything comes from god
[1:17:44] amen and then later on they suffered
[1:17:47] because the the the beast was the ox and
[1:17:50] they had to bury the burden
[1:17:52] amen they have to receive all these
[1:17:54] persecutions amen they could still
[1:17:57] worship god and raise their hand while
[1:17:59] they were being killed being martyred
[1:18:02] amen they can still raise their hand and
[1:18:05] while the the sisters amen with their
[1:18:07] with their long hairs being being dipped
[1:18:10] into the into the oil and then being
[1:18:12] burned
[1:18:14] in the middle of the night
[1:18:16] and while the men were hanging on those
[1:18:18] big trees
[1:18:19] being burned also by those persecutors
[1:18:21] in those days and historians could not
[1:18:24] believe
[1:18:25] how these people could stand all those
[1:18:29] kinds of persecutions and sufferings and
[1:18:31] giving their lives historians could not
[1:18:33] believe how god
[1:18:36] being worshiped
[1:18:38] and being promoted by these people
[1:18:41] could just keep himself watching them
[1:18:44] amen but somehow these people could
[1:18:46] stand all those kinds of sufferings and
[1:18:49] conditions because they were anointed to
[1:18:52] do so because the samaritan has placed
[1:18:55] them
[1:18:56] in his own beast
[1:18:58] and then came the the man anointing
[1:19:02] and then today
[1:19:03] he has sent us the flying eagle
[1:19:05] anointing
[1:19:07] amen and so we had to ride in this beast
[1:19:10] as we always say and that's the power
[1:19:12] amen that's the eagle anointing that we
[1:19:14] enjoy but remember
[1:19:17] amen as rebecca when she was being found
[1:19:19] by a loser
[1:19:22] the same beast
[1:19:25] amen
[1:19:26] that she gave water to drink
[1:19:30] was the same beast
[1:19:33] that brought her to isaac hallelujah so
[1:19:37] i believe we should be sensitive enough
[1:19:39] amen we are and i believe we are even
[1:19:42] sensitive enough and that's the reason
[1:19:45] you know there's no way i mean whether
[1:19:47] it's far whether it's me whether it's
[1:19:50] hard whether it's raining whether we're
[1:19:53] in a hard time we're sick or somewhere
[1:19:55] amen the eagle will always fly and look
[1:19:58] for that eagle food
[1:20:00] amen to feed amen that kind of anointing
[1:20:04] that is being
[1:20:05] given to us
[1:20:06] amen so he said now in in in the message
[1:20:09] jehovah jireh he said how that rebecca
[1:20:12] water that came in the cool of the
[1:20:14] evening eliza didn't find her in the
[1:20:16] morning he never found her at noontime
[1:20:19] he found her in the evening light
[1:20:22] it shall be light in the evening time
[1:20:24] right
[1:20:25] that's where he found her she veiled her
[1:20:27] face so she had no head
[1:20:30] amen she covered amen that's why even
[1:20:32] the wedding you know the women
[1:20:35] covered their head
[1:20:36] amen she was going to her head
[1:20:39] right
[1:20:41] a woman it's her nature
[1:20:44] of a woman to surrender to a man
[1:20:51] again a woman eats her nature
[1:21:00] to surrender to a man
[1:21:02] so if you see a woman that's not
[1:21:04] surrendering to a man it's not her
[1:21:05] nature
[1:21:09] you know that he she is not in her
[1:21:11] nature
[1:21:12] amen because
[1:21:14] the nature
[1:21:16] of a woman is to surrender to a man
[1:21:21] and it's the nature of the church to
[1:21:24] surrender to christ
[1:21:26] surrender to his will
[1:21:28] just surrender
[1:21:30] she has no thinking of her own she takes
[1:21:33] his word not somebody else's
[1:21:37] if eb would have done that
[1:21:40] we'd have never had to die but she
[1:21:42] listened to reasonings
[1:21:44] but the real bride of christ takes the
[1:21:47] headship of christ
[1:21:50] the word right and only believes god's
[1:21:52] word
[1:21:53] that's the real the restored bride
[1:21:56] hallelujah it's nearly time francis
[1:21:58] later than you think we're at the
[1:22:00] evening time the holy spirit is here
[1:22:04] amen
[1:22:05] and another message the spoken word is
[1:22:07] the original seed is that they will
[1:22:09] love him
[1:22:12] love his and will have his potentials
[1:22:15] for he is their head amen and they are
[1:22:17] his subjects
[1:22:19] subject to his head
[1:22:21] headship of christ was his notice what
[1:22:24] harmony jesus never did anything until
[1:22:26] sin of the father or the father showed
[1:22:28] him purse harmony between god and christ
[1:22:31] see john 5 19
[1:22:32] so will the bride and he shows her his
[1:22:35] word of life
[1:22:37] he shows her
[1:22:38] and she receives it
[1:22:40] she never doubts it
[1:22:42] nothing can harm her not even death
[1:22:46] for if the seed be planted the water
[1:22:48] will raise it up again
[1:22:51] here is the secret
[1:22:53] the word
[1:22:54] is in the bride
[1:22:57] in the mind of christ to know what he
[1:23:00] wants done with the word
[1:23:02] and she does it in his name she has thus
[1:23:05] saith the lord and it is germanized so
[1:23:08] the holy spirit waters it until it is
[1:23:11] grown and serves its purpose
[1:23:15] amen so only when we find ourselves amen
[1:23:18] in our rightful position then
[1:23:22] we can be serving god's
[1:23:25] purpose
[1:23:26] amen and god will bless us
[1:23:29] hallelujah somehow during the time you
[1:23:32] know again i remember that story of that
[1:23:34] uh uh you know
[1:23:37] i people you can look back at samson
[1:23:39] where you know he found that uh
[1:23:42] that job on
[1:23:44] amen
[1:23:46] you know no one would think
[1:23:49] that rottening joburn would be would be
[1:23:52] abuse
[1:23:54] right
[1:23:57] but during the time
[1:23:59] when samsung
[1:24:01] needing something to hold on
[1:24:05] that jawbone was just right there
[1:24:08] it was right
[1:24:10] at the right place
[1:24:12] at the right time
[1:24:15] and then it serve its purpose
[1:24:19] it was useless
[1:24:20] but when it was in the hand of samson
[1:24:24] amen that's why when i read i was
[1:24:26] surprised because if we read judges
[1:24:28] chapter 15
[1:24:31] we're going to see in verse 15
[1:24:33] and he found
[1:24:35] a new jew bone
[1:24:37] of an ass
[1:24:38] and put port his hand and took it and
[1:24:41] slew a thousand men there with amen how
[1:24:44] could that rottening jawbone be a new
[1:24:47] job on there
[1:24:49] amen but somehow it became a new job
[1:24:52] because now it will serve its purpose
[1:24:55] because it is in the right hand
[1:24:58] hallelujah so we can we can do something
[1:25:01] we can accomplish something for our own
[1:25:03] but as long as the right hand of god
[1:25:07] is holding us
[1:25:09] amen we cannot be amen serving our own
[1:25:12] purpose according to god's will so that
[1:25:15] new that job on became new because he
[1:25:18] was in the hand of samson which is the
[1:25:21] hand of god right at that very moment
[1:25:23] hallelujah so that's why when we when we
[1:25:26] submit ourselves we fully surrender
[1:25:28] ourselves to the lord
[1:25:30] amen what's the bible said behold all
[1:25:33] things are become new
[1:25:35] amen we become new creation in christ
[1:25:38] amen because we we we just humble
[1:25:42] ourselves and we just give ourselves
[1:25:44] this remains to be a neck
[1:25:47] amen and there is a connection there
[1:25:50] and whatever the head says
[1:25:52] the body will follow amen that's why the
[1:25:55] heart is placed here right yeah
[1:25:57] and the heart is placed
[1:25:59] in its rightful position
[1:26:02] amen and so i like what other preachers
[1:26:05] say you know sometimes there are people
[1:26:07] that will you know in their natural head
[1:26:09] they will miss
[1:26:10] the rapture by just merely a single foot
[1:26:14] amen right because they had it in their
[1:26:17] natural head but it didn't fall in their
[1:26:20] heart amen so it must be in this heart
[1:26:23] amen to get connected with to the right
[1:26:25] head which is jesus christ amen so you
[1:26:28] see amen how when when when
[1:26:31] when we recognize the headship of christ
[1:26:35] only then we can accomplish something
[1:26:38] for his own glory
[1:26:40] only then we can lift the name of the
[1:26:42] lord jesus christ amen when we fully
[1:26:44] surrender
[1:26:46] we don't reason we don't question
[1:26:49] and you know
[1:26:50] satan
[1:26:51] satan's
[1:26:53] trait is always to put question
[1:26:56] in god's word
[1:26:58] amen
[1:27:00] but when we fully surrender
[1:27:03] our will our hearts our lives to his
[1:27:06] word there's no more question and i
[1:27:09] remember when when when that when satan
[1:27:11] threw the serpent
[1:27:13] questioned the word
[1:27:15] amen and the next thing that that he
[1:27:17] said to eve know you not that you shall
[1:27:19] be like gods
[1:27:24] they wear
[1:27:29] amen because a son and daughter of god
[1:27:32] they were a mature god
[1:27:35] you know
[1:27:36] a kitten when he grows he's a cat
[1:27:40] amen so a son of god when he matures
[1:27:43] when he's in rightful position what will
[1:27:45] he be
[1:27:46] amen so adam and eve were amateur god
[1:27:50] right then
[1:27:51] amen
[1:27:52] but satan wants to put question right
[1:27:57] in those potential that they already
[1:28:00] have
[1:28:01] amen so by saying you see amen you know
[1:28:04] uh you can be like god
[1:28:08] amen well if only he could you know just
[1:28:11] said well i am
[1:28:14] there's no question
[1:28:16] amen so the same thing amen you know
[1:28:19] when when
[1:28:20] he puts question
[1:28:22] to your position to question you being
[1:28:24] the bread of jesus christ being part of
[1:28:27] the body of jesus christ but when you
[1:28:29] know your position
[1:28:31] when you know who you are
[1:28:34] amen that's where the mystery becomes
[1:28:37] unfolded right amen when you know who
[1:28:40] you are
[1:28:41] and we know what's to be done with the
[1:28:43] world
[1:28:44] amen and when we know our rightful
[1:28:46] position then only then we can be an
[1:28:48] invincible part of the invincible army
[1:28:51] amen so you see all these things through
[1:28:54] the message of the hour through through
[1:28:56] our relationship
[1:28:58] with the lord jesus christ
[1:29:00] and it has you know our relationship is
[1:29:02] uh as some
[1:29:05] has
[1:29:06] a great deal you know
[1:29:08] in serving the lord
[1:29:12] i read one time
[1:29:14] an article that says you know
[1:29:18] it's not religion but it's relation
[1:29:21] right and i agree and
[1:29:23] and he keeps on saying that the true the
[1:29:26] true
[1:29:27] uh
[1:29:28] true religion says true religion is
[1:29:32] uh
[1:29:33] sitting in the pew in the church
[1:29:37] and thinking about
[1:29:39] the lake fishing
[1:29:45] and relation he said and true relation
[1:29:48] is
[1:29:49] sitting on the lake fishing
[1:29:53] thinking about god
[1:29:58] but let me add something to that
[1:30:00] just make sure it's not on a sunday
[1:30:08] because i remember i remember two
[1:30:10] friends you know that you know they used
[1:30:11] to go to church together and say
[1:30:14] let's go to church oh i'm thinking i
[1:30:16] need to go fishing today just be like to
[1:30:18] go fishing really okay well i cannot go
[1:30:21] with you i go to the church and then you
[1:30:23] know the friend while he's in the church
[1:30:24] he's thinking of his friend
[1:30:30] so it is an example of a man sitting in
[1:30:33] the pew thinking about his he should be
[1:30:35] in the lake
[1:30:36] and the other man in the lake he's
[1:30:38] speaking and then he said oh what
[1:30:40] brother what what you you know
[1:30:44] what is brother samuel preaching today
[1:30:49] so you see let me tell you both of them
[1:30:51] are losers
[1:30:58] we should occupy our rightful position
[1:31:01] amen we should always occupy our
[1:31:03] position you see you have you have seats
[1:31:06] in here i don't know but you have seats
[1:31:08] here amen that every time you feel
[1:31:10] comfortable
[1:31:12] right you want to be there just right
[1:31:14] there and every time you sit there and
[1:31:17] then you feel comfortable as if god you
[1:31:19] know there is there is some kind of a
[1:31:20] channel that the blessing is just going
[1:31:23] straight to you
[1:31:24] that's why you go to church because you
[1:31:26] want nobody will take that position
[1:31:29] amen and and and you see but somehow you
[1:31:32] know just you also remember your pastor
[1:31:36] amen that your pastor amen when you when
[1:31:38] he looks in this area he knows who's
[1:31:40] sitting there right yeah amen but you
[1:31:43] see amen it kind of encouraged us also
[1:31:47] amen that you know amen you know all of
[1:31:50] us are in need and and we are submitting
[1:31:52] ourselves we cannot we can sacrifice
[1:31:54] everything and see it and encourage the
[1:31:56] ministry i mean encourage our brothers
[1:31:59] sometimes we go to church not just to
[1:32:01] get blessings
[1:32:03] but we want to be a blessing we want to
[1:32:05] be an encouragement hallelujah that just
[1:32:09] merely our presence
[1:32:11] hallelujah can glorify god because
[1:32:13] somebody's sitting in here when when
[1:32:16] when when when you are there just right
[1:32:18] there people you know you just say amen
[1:32:20] how are you god bless you amen and the
[1:32:23] the some kind of a spirit kindred spirit
[1:32:26] that will bring up encouragement to each
[1:32:28] and every one of us amen and all these
[1:32:30] things amen so just like the warriors
[1:32:33] the fighters of israel they came from
[1:32:36] different battles
[1:32:38] they came from barrio's location they
[1:32:40] had different gifts but they came to one
[1:32:43] place
[1:32:44] amen to bring david as king to recognize
[1:32:47] him as king
[1:32:49] hallelujah and no one but david must be
[1:32:52] their king
[1:32:53] and it's the same thing today we come
[1:32:55] here
[1:32:57] we we fought our own battles for a week
[1:33:00] all of us have our own battles with
[1:33:03] different sizes
[1:33:04] with different places but it's the same
[1:33:06] satan amen but all these warriors
[1:33:11] men
[1:33:12] expert in wars
[1:33:14] hallelujah come together
[1:33:17] to bring david king
[1:33:19] hallelujah we have come here to leave
[1:33:21] jesus christ as our king i mean he's the
[1:33:24] head
[1:33:25] of all amen and and we we we submit
[1:33:28] ourselves to him and we declare that he
[1:33:32] has taken the hardship of our lives
[1:33:35] oh my on what a relationship with that
[1:33:38] kind you know when we come into that
[1:33:40] relationship you know there's many
[1:33:42] things just like you know just like
[1:33:44] hosea that we we often we often call
[1:33:47] you know uh
[1:33:49] uh chapter 2 verse 16 that in that day
[1:33:53] he said you're not going to call me
[1:33:57] ba ali but also easy
[1:34:00] amen
[1:34:01] and easy means husband
[1:34:04] and ba'ali means lord
[1:34:07] but it's a prophecy for you and i and me
[1:34:12] that the time has come
[1:34:14] that he is not only lord for us
[1:34:19] but he is
[1:34:20] husband for us
[1:34:23] amen and with these two kinds of
[1:34:25] relationship there is much difference
[1:34:29] because
[1:34:31] him being our lord
[1:34:35] there is some kind of
[1:34:37] of course he is our lord
[1:34:39] abraham remains to be the lord to sarah
[1:34:42] amen
[1:34:45] but you know when you when you
[1:34:47] violate when you uh
[1:34:50] violate something
[1:34:52] against your lord you get the penalty
[1:34:54] amen
[1:34:58] but look at eve
[1:35:01] amen
[1:35:04] but her head was there
[1:35:06] because
[1:35:07] she was part of him
[1:35:12] adam did not say well lord i still have
[1:35:14] many ribs here
[1:35:17] you can take another one
[1:35:19] but no it will not make adam complete
[1:35:24] without that right because she
[1:35:26] that was the predestinated
[1:35:29] bride
[1:35:30] for adam she's born of her bones
[1:35:34] and flesh of his flesh and with those
[1:35:36] kind of relationship
[1:35:38] amen
[1:35:39] you know when you broke something
[1:35:43] a wife
[1:35:45] can
[1:35:46] broke something in the house can break
[1:35:48] something in the house
[1:35:51] but the husband will not ask him to pay
[1:35:53] for it
[1:35:55] but if you work in a company and you
[1:35:57] broke something
[1:35:59] the boss will ask you to pay for it
[1:36:02] because the relationship is lowered
[1:36:05] right
[1:36:08] and servant but when it comes to the
[1:36:11] relationship of husband and wife
[1:36:14] it's all the rest brothers and sisters
[1:36:16] amen we find rest
[1:36:20] in the presence of the head
[1:36:23] hallelujah and so we see
[1:36:25] that's why everything he's the provider
[1:36:28] of all our needs
[1:36:30] he's the healer
[1:36:33] and he is the redeemer
[1:36:35] of the body
[1:36:36] so i thank the lord
[1:36:39] that we have come to the point
[1:36:42] that we have already recognized him
[1:36:46] as our absolute head
[1:36:48] amen and when we read this scripture
[1:36:51] jesus is happy to quote this scripture
[1:36:53] today
[1:36:55] nest
[1:36:56] birds have nests
[1:36:58] boxes of holes
[1:37:01] and i thank
[1:37:04] for the bride because the son of man
[1:37:08] also has
[1:37:11] the neck right amen to lay the head
[1:37:15] hallelujah
[1:37:17] so god bless you and may this little
[1:37:20] ministry has
[1:37:22] been a blessing
[1:37:24] and you're always been a blessing to me
[1:37:27] amen brother samuel and brother wade
[1:37:28] there's been a great encouragement for
[1:37:31] us
[1:37:31] amen and i really appreciate you staying
[1:37:35] amen and uh i really enjoyed that great
[1:37:38] testimony amen and i i keep it in my
[1:37:41] heart
[1:37:41] amen that god
[1:37:43] he's the same god here and he's the same
[1:37:46] god over there
[1:37:47] hallelujah so god bless you and you keep
[1:37:50] on praying for brother dany and don't
[1:37:52] forget
[1:37:53] that on november 18 19 and 20 there will
[1:37:56] be 150
[1:37:59] ministers in myanmar that will be
[1:38:02] hearing this message
[1:38:04] for the very first time we're not after
[1:38:07] numbers or not after quantity but it's
[1:38:09] the quality but if there is one there
[1:38:11] peter branham said only one
[1:38:13] amen can can turn myanmar upside down
[1:38:16] hallelujah but who knows amen who knows
[1:38:19] so we just give them the opportunity
[1:38:21] because we believe amen that if there's
[1:38:24] seed laying there it only takes the rain
[1:38:27] and the sunshine and the life will come
[1:38:30] out right hallelujah so
[1:38:32] let's keep it in your prayers and also
[1:38:34] my trip to japan this coming october and
[1:38:37] now uh
[1:38:39] uh by the way does
[1:38:41] shown me an email somewhere in davao in
[1:38:44] the philippines that's all that's that's
[1:38:46] also my route because i go to ghidapawan
[1:38:48] that is uh
[1:38:50] part of that kidapawan city which is
[1:38:52] cotabato if you if you see in the
[1:38:54] uh
[1:38:55] in the map you see that that portion
[1:38:57] there are muslims also that's further
[1:38:59] south of the the country where muslims
[1:39:01] in the philippines stay but we have we
[1:39:03] have ministry also there and there is no
[1:39:06] straight flight to kidapawan but you
[1:39:08] have to come to pass through davao and
[1:39:11] probably if there's opportunity that
[1:39:13] contact we're going to drop by there and
[1:39:15] meet him and we just don't know what the
[1:39:18] lord will uh will do so god bless you
[1:39:21] and always stay in our position let him
[1:39:24] be the head
[1:39:26] of our lives and we don't reason we
[1:39:28] don't question him all things work
[1:39:30] together for good right i love him god
[1:39:33] bless you amen for the same amen

[1:39:50] because we believe in headship yes sir
[1:39:53] you know
[1:39:56] a headless horseman wouldn't do too good
[1:39:59] because it wouldn't know where it's
[1:40:00] going
[1:40:04] that may be where we've been in our
[1:40:06] lives a lot of times we maybe didn't
[1:40:07] know which way was going oh yeah
[1:40:09] but we've come to find our head
[1:40:11] and our head is christ
[1:40:13] and he's the word amen so then we go to
[1:40:16] the word we know who the headship is and
[1:40:17] know what to do with it right so go
[1:40:19] ahead brother number 80
