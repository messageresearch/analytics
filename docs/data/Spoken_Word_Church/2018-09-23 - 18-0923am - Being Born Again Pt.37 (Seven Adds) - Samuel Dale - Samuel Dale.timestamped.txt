[8:52] worked out for her to be able to get her
[8:55] passport or whatever it has to be done

[9:02] that okay father we thank you for your
[9:04] grace and your love thank you for all
[9:06] things and we ask you now to just be

[9:16] be with us thank you for all things and
[9:19] we praise your great names you said you
[9:21] promised us that you'd be with us and it
[9:24] should send your word and it would heal
[9:26] us and deliver us from destruction so we
[9:29] believe you thank you for these things
[9:31] we love you in Jesus name Amen
[9:41] seeing you have purified your souls and
[9:44] obeying the truth through the spirit
[9:45] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[9:49] that you love one another with a pure
[9:50] heart fervently now how is it that we're
[9:54] born again being born again not of
[9:59] corruptible seed not of our thoughts or
[10:02] ideas and things what is it but of
[10:05] incorruptible now what is incorruptible
[10:09] you say well there's something that
[10:11] can't be corrupted okay then what does
[10:13] the scripture say by the Word of God so
[10:17] that's the incorruptible Rite which
[10:19] liveth and abideth for ever
[10:22] mmm-hmm then we'll go to the second
[10:28] Peter Simon Peter a servant an apostle
[10:30] of Jesus Christ to them that have
[10:33] obtained like precious faith now who's
[10:35] he writing this to to the church it's
[10:37] not written to the world it's to those
[10:39] who are born again Christians fill with
[10:43] the Holy Spirit walking in the light of
[10:45] the love of God all right Simon Peter
[10:47] serve it an apostle of Jesus Christ to
[10:50] them that have obtained like precious
[10:51] faith with us through the righteousness
[10:54] of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace
[10:57] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[10:59] the knowledge of God and of Jesus our
[11:02] Lord according as his divine power has
[11:05] given unto us all things that pertain
[11:07] unto life and godliness through the
[11:11] knowledge of him that have called us to
[11:13] glory and virtue whereby are given unto
[11:17] us exceeding great and precious promises
[11:20] what did the prophets say by these
[11:22] promises all right that by these you
[11:25] might be partakers of the divine nature
[11:27] having escaped the corruption that is in
[11:30] the world through lust and beside this
[11:32] giving all diligence add to your faith
[11:35] virtue and to virtue knowledge and the
[11:38] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[11:39] patience and to patience godliness and
[11:42] to godliness brotherly kindness and to
[11:45] brotherly kindness charity you may be
[11:48] seated Lord at his blessing to the
[11:51] reading of the word now
[11:55] trying to trying to climax adult with us
[12:05] you know into the doings and we'll try
[12:08] to then well I guess we need to do right
[12:12] about now is how questions and answers
[12:15] so anybody has any questions anything
[12:20] about what we've been talking about on
[12:22] the statue of a perfect man you know
[12:26] would you please turn them in and that
[12:27] way I can cover them we'll take a whole
[12:30] service we'll take whatever it needs to
[12:33] be able to get you to understand because
[12:36] we won't we want everybody to know what
[12:39] it's being said I want you to know what
[12:41] I'm saying now whether or not you agree
[12:43] with it or what you do that's between
[12:45] you and God
[12:46] I can't determine that part but I want
[12:49] to make sure that you know what I mean
[12:52] all right so then if there's nothing
[12:55] else just write out brother Dale what do
[12:56] you mean
[12:57] you know I don't I don't have no
[12:59] problems with anybody with questions I
[13:01] love questions and answers we have that
[13:04] once a month and we do we have a
[13:06] wonderful time because we just let
[13:08] everybody get involved anybody can ask
[13:11] the question anybody can answer the
[13:13] question so that's the way I love it to
[13:15] work we can fellowship together around
[13:18] the word all right now you have to have
[13:20] a controlling factor arrived so we try
[13:23] to control that point as two things but
[13:27] yet still you know we want to to keep it
[13:32] in that but now we've been talking about
[13:35] the statue of a perfect man and we've
[13:36] read here over and over and over as
[13:39] Peter is saying and we've covered the
[13:42] the emphasis back word that you know
[13:45] that we're built on the foundation of
[13:47] the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ
[13:49] being the chief Cornerstone built upon
[13:52] what they teach all right so here's
[13:55] Peter coming over to teach the church
[13:59] how to come to where he's at what does
[14:02] the schoolteacher do
[14:05] you know I mean what what disease you
[14:08] know schoolteacher what does the
[14:09] schoolteacher do they teach you what
[14:11] they know or what they've experienced or
[14:14] what they've been brought through and
[14:16] there's no need of of sitting there you
[14:19] know if I was a schoolteacher I would
[14:22] emphasize like I did with one of the
[14:25] brothers who went overseas with and I
[14:29] said not listen brothers you'reyou're
[14:31] emphasizing here that God sent a prophet
[14:34] I said all that's well and good you've
[14:37] done a marvelous job of presenting it
[14:39] but now next year are you going to take
[14:41] that little maybe a couple of hundred
[14:43] and maybe they might get two or three
[14:46] more hundred and two and you're gonna
[14:47] put them all in one group and and you're
[14:49] gonna teach them over again that brother
[14:50] Branham was a prophet I said that's not
[14:53] very much advancement I said what you
[14:56] need to do is you need to take these
[14:58] you've already taught it set them aside
[15:00] with someone to teach them what the
[15:03] Prophet taught well you know we got a I
[15:06] got a notice that the country heads from
[15:09] where they were sending these things the
[15:11] people said you have told us that God
[15:14] sent a prophet now teach us what he
[15:17] taught
[15:17] well that would should be what should be
[15:20] the joy and the thoughts of thoughts of
[15:22] all of it and that's what I've tried to
[15:24] make emphases off Peter writes the
[15:27] Statue of a perfect man here in 2nd
[15:29] Peter and he's already spoken first
[15:32] Peter about being born again and the
[15:35] different things you know you know and
[15:37] how that takes place and then when he
[15:39] comes to second Peter
[15:40] he says addressing these to them of like
[15:43] precious faith you read the book the
[15:46] message you're supposed to or the statue
[15:48] of a perfect man that what you you this
[15:51] is not addressed to the world this is
[15:53] addressed to those that are in Christ
[15:55] but this dress to the babies in Christ
[15:59] that we may grow thereby
[16:01] and grow into the virtues and things to
[16:04] were they were because why would you
[16:09] teach it any other way that they're
[16:10] growing into that and we've covered now
[16:13] to try to get the emphases we've covered
[16:15] that even Paul picks up and run around
[16:17] said Paul
[16:18] and Peter he said they only confer just
[16:21] a little bit there so matter-of-fact bro
[16:23] run said he never told but it never did
[16:25] but they did because it you know there
[16:27] is a little section that Paul and Peter
[16:29] was together for a few days but yet they
[16:32] never discussed probably the message or
[16:34] anything Paul goes one way Peter another
[16:37] Paul comes back out he meets God on the
[16:39] backside of the desert he comes out
[16:41] preaching the same thing Peter preaches
[16:44] so they can't be any difference between
[16:46] Peter of the statue of a perfect man as
[16:49] he's expressing that you add to your
[16:52] faith virtue or knowledge temperance
[16:54] patience I don't like it they can't be
[16:56] any different that in Paul saying that
[16:59] adoption that you're born into the
[17:02] family then your positionally placed in
[17:04] the family or adopted in to the family
[17:07] you know and all and they got to be
[17:10] saying the same thing because that is
[17:12] the essence of the Word of God
[17:14] alright now I've tried to make that
[17:16] emphasis over and over and over to us
[17:19] the word this is not written to sinner's
[17:23] the Bible is not written to sinner's it
[17:26] can only tell a sinner days lost it is
[17:30] not for him
[17:31] it can only tell him he's lost he needs
[17:33] to be saved
[17:34] oh yeah hate and read the judgments or
[17:36] whatever you know things like that but
[17:38] still it's not for him it's only for
[17:41] those that are in Christ Jesus as babies
[17:44] to grow in the word and understand and
[17:49] that's what that's my emphasis for 40
[17:52] years now so I might as well just keep
[17:53] on going it you know because that's what
[17:55] I believe I believe what the Prophet
[17:57] taught all right but now knowing that we
[18:01] have to understand by way of the Prophet
[18:06] I emphasize especially the last message
[18:10] and the one a little prior to it though
[18:12] the things that what that you can't take
[18:16] natural wording of human terminologies
[18:20] because remember the best you can do
[18:23] this Bible was handed down to us from
[18:27] Greek Hebrew etc etc all right in
[18:31] that doing that would have to be God to
[18:33] keep it straight all right and he did
[18:36] keep it straight that's why I love the
[18:38] King James Version because it is a
[18:41] translation of translations the King
[18:44] James Bible is not a translation from
[18:46] from the manuscripts as much as some of
[18:50] the others some of the things you won't
[18:52] even read good news to modern men he's
[18:55] taken a lot of it from Greek scholar you
[18:59] know the the the Hebrew the Greek but
[19:02] they brought the King James Version is
[19:05] the translation of translations and
[19:07] brought it unto us and I believe that
[19:09] don't you
[19:10] and I believe God vindicated it by the
[19:13] Prophet coming and using that to speak
[19:17] to us of the things that God wanted us
[19:20] to know well our huh see then in the
[19:23] natural wording as I've emphasized as it
[19:26] came down when you come to virtue our
[19:29] natural word runs it to virgin birth you
[19:32] know all right
[19:34] you know I'm an excuse me virginity all
[19:37] right to wear that you're just a virgin
[19:40] but that's not run around said that's
[19:42] not according to what this is saying
[19:45] this is saying virgin T as a virtuous
[19:49] life our our you know living in Christ
[19:52] and and having to these things to dwell
[19:56] within us all right see then that way
[19:58] you can't just take something to say
[20:01] well I believe this well I see we've had
[20:04] a prophet now if he went to a theologian
[20:07] he'd tell you that this leans over to
[20:13] this he wouldn't give you the answer
[20:16] that it can be brought over here to a
[20:18] virtuous life in time all right just
[20:20] like him
[20:21] in patience and temperance and time all
[20:23] right if you asked a theologian or
[20:25] interpreter an interpreter a translator
[20:30] from the Bible terms is not supposed to
[20:32] be translating what he thinks he's
[20:34] translating words right you know I mean
[20:38] those people that bring in us those
[20:40] things are translating words they're not
[20:42] supposed to be translating by revel
[20:45] they're not supposed to write it now
[20:47] this is what I think they're supposed to
[20:51] put down what it is said and that's what
[20:54] it is so the natural would be the Virgin
[20:56] part the temperance would be not
[20:59] drinking alcohol right that would be
[21:04] what would be there from the theological
[21:06] side of it but here comes a prophet to
[21:09] tell us what God is saying and that's
[21:13] why I love it that way see who would
[21:15] have read of Peter there in Chapter you
[21:19] know the first chapters 2nd Peter we're
[21:23] talking about - those that are like
[21:25] precious faith where would the
[21:27] theological terminologies be able to
[21:29] express that and tell us what that's
[21:33] saying I say and this is only written to
[21:36] those that are already born again
[21:38] he's already covered the new birth in
[21:41] chapter 1 you know in in first Peter 1
[21:46] he's already covered the new birth being
[21:47] born again that's why I keep reading
[21:49] that over and over and over and over
[21:51] he's already explained it now he's
[21:55] telling you how to a growth development
[21:56] to get to where he was like a school
[21:59] teacher is trying to get you to pass the
[22:01] test right and all of that and go down
[22:06] through there and we could come in to a
[22:07] lot of things of tutors and think of the
[22:09] statue of a perfect man because they
[22:11] said they'd say actually real true where
[22:14] you go to college and you get a tutor
[22:15] that when when it's finished of that
[22:19] grade it's not you passing the test
[22:21] it's the tutor but he's instilled into
[22:25] you once you answer the questions is
[22:27] what he told you
[22:28] so who's Tyson's ask the tutor all right
[22:31] the Holy Ghost is one person to test it
[22:33] all of us all right
[22:34] but now listen here's the thought for a
[22:38] little bit see you you that way you can
[22:41] say well the Prophet says this so we got
[22:45] to go by what he says
[22:48] all right and when we go by what he says
[22:52] then we can understand all right
[22:56] so if he says something that sounds
[22:58] contrary to the natural who are we
[23:04] supposed to follow we're not supposed to
[23:09] follow the theological side or
[23:11] terminologies of what a word says we're
[23:15] to follow it as to what the Prophet
[23:17] brought us from the word for us to see
[23:21] that all right so Peter says add to your
[23:26] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[23:29] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[23:31] add to your faith all right now there's
[23:36] a key there that we need to understand
[23:40] okay now to look at the pyramid that's
[23:44] what we call it all see you'd call off
[23:46] and you'd say well there's one two three
[23:49] four five six seven eight two three four
[23:55] five six seven eight well there's only
[23:57] seven Church ages so now we've done fall
[24:00] we're done fell off
[24:04] you know we're missing the point
[24:08] so we go back to the prophet and we ask
[24:13] him say what does it mean then okay all
[24:19] right
[24:20] so this is what he says the brothers
[24:22] will pull it up back there off the
[24:28] statue of a perfect man paragraph 141
[24:38] okay now here is what we do what's the
[24:44] first thing how faith and be born again
[24:50] that's laying the foundation okay now
[24:55] what is the foundation faith what do you
[25:00] do now faith and be born again okay yeah
[25:07] then after you lay the foundation
[25:09] secondly you add to your foundation add
[25:14] to your faith Peter says here first you
[25:20] have faith then you add virture to your
[25:22] faith this is the next column first pour
[25:26] your fat pour your foundation faith then
[25:29] do your faith at virtually all right
[25:31] going to the next one progress 65 of
[25:34] blasphemous names they were through that
[25:39] one so all right I'll give you these
[25:41] what we're gonna walk them back there so
[25:43] I guess you see me carrying the notes
[25:45] you know look what he says first
[25:53] foundationally it's faith second add to
[25:58] your faith now is that what Peter says
[26:04] add to your faith virtue all right now I
[26:10] want you to look and thank women for a
[26:12] minute you say well you know you're just
[26:14] you're too much this that but now I want
[26:16] you to give me the answer if you could
[26:18] do it hey we got to go to the Prophet
[26:21] and let him answer the question so
[26:24] have we got how many ads have we got in
[26:29] this pyramid I mean the ads see that's
[26:36] where you you don't follow what the
[26:38] Prophet said faith is not an ad now I've
[26:43] taught you that for 30 or 40 years all
[26:45] right so it's not new all right faith is
[26:49] not an ad faith is a birth first how
[26:57] faith and be born again they don't say
[27:00] had faith the Prophet didn't say ad food
[27:05] he said how faith and be born again
[27:08] all right now then he says ad virtue
[27:15] okay
[27:16] see how faith can be born again add to
[27:22] your faith virtue to her virtue our
[27:23] knowledge etc etcetera company now
[27:26] that's what it takes to become a servant
[27:28] of Jesus Christ Christ builds his church
[27:31] in seven Church ages his bride a
[27:35] personal woman Church seven Church ages
[27:38] constitute and make the bride somehow
[27:41] they say some of this and you know a
[27:43] different one all right seven church
[27:45] ages
[27:47] okay now think about it
[27:56] so you're mathematically gonna get
[27:58] yourself out of line if you don't follow
[28:01] the Prophet C and what he's saying okay
[28:05] let me make sure we're getting this tape
[28:10] I got 65 back up to the top of let's
[28:14] read a little bit on the 65 code we got
[28:17] a little key in there hey Virtanen add
[28:23] to your faith it's not yours
[28:27] it's God give it to you but when he
[28:29] gives it to you it becomes yours
[28:30] the virtues are not your virtues they're
[28:33] God's virtues but when he gives them to
[28:35] you they belong to you is everybody with
[28:37] me
[28:39] but he's got to give them to you all
[28:42] right
[28:43] see so we know the Prophet said you have
[28:46] faith him be born again he said don't
[28:47] worry about the rest
[28:48] he said Carter's going to be
[28:49] automatically added what automatically
[28:53] because God is going to add to his own
[28:56] faith
[28:58] so how faith and be born again and watch
[29:01] what he say it
[29:02] you had temperance and patience and from
[29:05] godliness to brotherly love brotherly
[29:07] kindness and then love being the
[29:09] capstone
[29:13] seven of those things seven of those
[29:21] times
[29:22] how many virtues are they
[29:30] if you say well okay faith is a virtue
[29:33] then if you're doing it the other way
[29:34] you got one two three four five six
[29:37] seven eight and you're running off if
[29:43] you say faith is a birth a baby when
[29:47] it's born it's born the baby right it's
[29:51] not something that is it does or
[29:53] whatever it comes forth as a child all
[29:56] right
[29:57] the end it can be added to that child to
[30:01] the word can grow up the food to the
[30:03] scene so he said now there's seven
[30:05] things no brother branham seven things
[30:10] if you're saying faith isn't add you got
[30:13] eight things but what if he's saying
[30:17] faith is a birth not an ad then you add
[30:20] virtue so now you got one two three four
[30:24] five six seven see we're having to go to
[30:32] the Proverbs we can't go to a theologian
[30:34] to ask him a question because he
[30:37] couldn't answer the question but the
[30:39] Prophet can answer the quiz so how many
[30:41] ads right how many verses on seven and
[30:45] when the ads are they seven all right so
[30:50] you get what I told matter this past
[30:52] Wednesday night I didn't bring these all
[30:56] right now go to God's only provided
[31:00] place of worship then I gave him these
[31:03] sisters which would be 1a
[31:08] now look what he's talking about in 1965
[31:12] all right
[31:14] he's talking about the pyramid being
[31:17] those foundations up into the King's
[31:19] Chamber and just before you hit the
[31:21] seventh wall there's a little
[31:22] introduction point where a messenger
[31:25] comes out to bring you to the king the
[31:27] messenger John the Baptist that
[31:29] introduced to the king but the headstone
[31:32] was rejected and they don't know the
[31:34] stone is grown and whatever it is they
[31:37] don't know where it's at because it's a
[31:40] rejected stone but that's the stone that
[31:42] caps the whole thing
[31:44] that makes it to pyramid through the
[31:46] complete seven Church ages not eight
[31:49] ages or anything seven ages aren't now
[31:53] look had grace had this at this where is
[31:57] he that second Peter right he doesn't
[32:02] call it out but that's his his point
[32:05] right look there are seven adds alright
[32:13] now we got him in sixty five three years
[32:15] almost later and he still holds his
[32:18] point that there's seven adds and look
[32:21] at the key the last one is Christ so
[32:24] what is the last the headstone which is
[32:28] Christ see I'm just trying to make
[32:32] something natural to where you can look
[32:35] at it for you to get the spiritual
[32:37] application of it of the new birth so
[32:40] how many how many virtues are they if
[32:44] you make faith a virtue then you run out
[32:46] with the wrong number but if faith is a
[32:49] birth or a baby coming into the world
[32:53] then it starts just growing right okay
[32:57] alright so in the statue of a perfect
[32:59] man what is it how faith and be born
[33:01] again that's the new birth then add to
[33:07] your born to get experience virtue
[33:10] knowledge temperance you come out with
[33:13] your numbers being correctly and you've
[33:15] got seven virtues and seven adds and all
[33:21] of it fits into the right category to
[33:24] where that you can look at what the
[33:25] Prophet is saying to us all right
[33:28] he's not taking a theological side
[33:31] because it would be dealing with a
[33:33] number eight that's fine we can go with
[33:36] the number eight and we will eventually
[33:38] but yet still hold a point
[33:42] and many virtues are they you said with
[33:46] a it faith or it see no you can't start
[33:48] on faith faith is a new birth see that's
[33:53] why Paul is so important to understand
[33:56] adoption with Peter of the statute of
[33:59] perfect man because Paul is dealing with
[34:02] the child being born into the body a
[34:05] natural child born into a natural family
[34:09] is what Paul is using adoption to
[34:11] express which is the what which is the
[34:13] new birth to bring us into the body of
[34:17] Christ giving us new eternal life and
[34:20] then the growth development of the child
[34:23] is the adding of the virtues so Peter
[34:28] and and James is doing the same thing
[34:31] our Peter Peter and Paul are teaching
[34:35] the same thing that way you can hold the
[34:38] Bible together with understanding to
[34:42] follow where we're at
[34:44] alright see then there's the importance
[34:47] of it okay you can't take the ages and
[34:52] go into eternity you're going to injure
[34:56] ages and eternity will start eternity
[34:59] will be the eighth right that's your
[35:04] eighth but you stay with long as you're
[35:06] staying with the ages so there's seven
[35:08] church ages
[35:11] there are seven virtues one for each age
[35:15] and that's why that then there's no
[35:18] problem
[35:18] when we come in to what we were trying
[35:21] to do there Wednesday then what we were
[35:26] talking about the odd part of how that's
[35:32] in the natural Philadelphia in the
[35:39] natural would be called godliness
[35:43] because it's Philadelphia meaning
[35:47] brotherly kindness but then here comes a
[35:50] prophet alone and he puts lady OCU as
[35:54] brotherly kindness that's what I was
[35:59] trying to get you to say that's the same
[36:01] thing you're just looking at it wrong
[36:05] one of them is bringing out an age or a
[36:09] point of an age the other one is
[36:12] bringing out the age that we're living
[36:14] in all right and see it's wonderful then
[36:19] if we understand it now if I get time I
[36:22] got a lot to read on these things but
[36:25] you know if not we're picking up later
[36:28] because listen Church we're talking
[36:34] about something supernatural something
[36:36] spiritual something by revelation that
[36:39] must be understood that's why people try
[36:42] to understand the message by intellect
[36:44] and you can't do that and what's so
[36:48] funny is here I spend my time taking
[36:51] these things to show that they do not
[36:54] contradict one to the other one that
[36:56] they come out to say the same thing and
[36:58] lay it out in perving on the one that's
[37:01] called the inner life
[37:05] I don't get to have I'm sorry I don't
[37:10] get that what you're saying is I don't
[37:13] understand what you're talking about to
[37:15] the yeren intellect
[37:21] if Paul said when I went to him whatever
[37:24] says it have I become your enemy because
[37:26] of told you the truth you know have I
[37:29] spent my whole life to try to bring this
[37:31] message and break it down to the people
[37:33] and become the enemy to the people you
[37:36] know an enemy to it and then when it
[37:41] does see then I make statements and
[37:43] people do really go haywire
[37:45] I said come and explain it I said come
[37:53] and explain it explain to me how are you
[37:59] going to get number-wise without going
[38:03] the way that I went if you put faith as
[38:07] a virtue
[38:10] you've got eight count but if you do
[38:18] what the Bible say it add to your faith
[38:22] virtue is added to your faith it's your
[38:29] faith God has given this is my I the
[38:32] Prophet said God gave it to me he gives
[38:35] us the new birth that's the faith of God
[38:39] that's a revelation of Jesus Christ to
[38:42] you there's a new birth
[38:46] there's your baptism of the Holy Ghost
[38:49] but that people can't understand what
[38:51] brother Branham says it and blaspheme
[38:53] his name he said it's a moment most
[38:55] missed out they ain't talked correctly
[38:58] of the baptism see how no problem we're
[39:01] saying the born-again experience right
[39:04] here of faith is the baptism of the Holy
[39:07] Spirit but then that in here comes a
[39:10] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[39:12] hooking up to your headstone
[39:17] because I'm teaching a baby born into
[39:21] the family is that Paul is that Peter
[39:25] born into the family you burn then a
[39:28] growth development goes into that child
[39:32] to bring that child up until it has the
[39:34] very nature of the father
[39:45] then it'll fit together I don't have to
[39:48] deny anything the Prophet says bring it
[39:50] to them and let's say I mom I'm serious
[39:53] I cry in my heart you think I'm exalted
[39:56] and all these that you know I cry in my
[39:58] heart I'm trying my best to get you to
[40:01] see Jesus Christ that's always been my
[40:05] goal not to see ideas and thoughts and
[40:09] things but to see Jesus Christ but to be
[40:15] able to take the entire Bible
[40:18] listen church there's doctrines that
[40:20] says if this what I'm talking about
[40:22] right you're gonna have to turn this
[40:23] pyramid upside down now some of you
[40:27] heard those doctrines but wasn't you
[40:32] paying attention then the dead didn't
[40:39] you order realize hey wait a minute that
[40:41] was wrong but wouldn't brother Adams
[40:45] coming up here and he said he said you
[40:47] come all the way up here to God in this
[40:49] place that's really worried stop he said
[40:52] you ain't got to hold a ghost yet we'll
[40:54] look it up he he he said we didn't have
[40:56] no Holy Ghost you don't have the Holy
[40:59] Ghost like they had it you have the new
[41:04] birth that faith that is your new birth
[41:07] that is the baptism with all go that is
[41:10] the 3,000 outside that receive the Holy
[41:13] Ghost on the day of Pentecost and
[41:16] brother Branham said what the baptism of
[41:19] the Holy Ghost exactly like
[41:22] the day of Pentecost some people say
[41:27] what I just don't see how they can be
[41:28] that does that change it cuz we don't
[41:30] see it but we ought to see that hey what
[41:34] we're doing the reason we're here we've
[41:39] had 50 years to study the message to get
[41:45] it were that it's not contradictory
[41:52] which the people are still to the point
[41:54] you say something and then we'll
[41:56] computers gonna keep it up yeah but he
[42:00] don't understand if he understood this
[42:03] right here that brother so-and-so talked
[42:06] then I say well listen come on get
[42:09] brother someone so let's talk and no
[42:11] problem I'm not arrogant or hateful or
[42:15] mean I'm trying to be the truth if
[42:17] brother sword so can straighten us out
[42:19] get him
[42:22] if we need straightening out let's get
[42:24] what it's straightening that that's all
[42:27] I've ever done but it makes me sound
[42:30] like seated I'm some kind of a hair I
[42:32] got a hateful old dude that don't listen
[42:34] to nobody else I'll listen to you but I
[42:39] ain't gonna listen to you say well this
[42:41] is the way I think it is brother damn
[42:43] don't tell me what you think tell me
[42:47] what the prophets said well I think he
[42:52] meant now don't tell me what he meant I
[42:57] didn't tell you what he meant when he
[43:00] said that to be a virgin part of the
[43:03] statue of a perfect man they weren't it
[43:06] says you know virtue that that has don't
[43:10] have anything to do with a natural
[43:12] virgin person did I interpret that or
[43:18] did not read what he said well I just
[43:24] don't like your witness praise God I
[43:26] don't like it either but I've done I've
[43:29] hollered and screamed this for 50 years
[43:31] so there's no need to quitting now we
[43:36] just keep on hammering it because I can
[43:39] show you where I preached this 40 years
[43:41] ago this away got the tapes to cover it
[43:48] be glad for you to listen to them let's
[43:53] see people doing the listen they want
[43:56] their ideas and their thoughts unless I
[44:00] think was brother Oh see that's where
[44:02] even that's not well we don't have no
[44:05] right to think I didn't say that your
[44:08] prophet said sheep have no rights now
[44:14] you talk to him mother he's a cheap no
[44:17] hell no rights they forfeit all right
[44:19] a born-again Christian today you
[44:21] accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior you
[44:23] you've supposed to have forfeited all of
[44:25] your thoughts and ideas that were
[44:27] contrary to the Word of God
[44:29] I said supposed to admit we didn't
[44:33] I said we we studied out things on our
[44:38] own and tried to do this out the other
[44:39] but see after a while you come to find
[44:42] out that what we're doing is just
[44:45] beating our head against the wall back
[44:48] up listen to the Prophet and many ads
[44:55] are they he said seven heads and many
[45:00] virtues are they seven virtues faith is
[45:04] not a virtue faith is a birth
[45:06] perchik one two three five six seven
[45:11] seven virtues now the message is right
[45:15] the Prophet is right well I've always
[45:17] know that what you did you said you did
[45:22] and I'm just saying you make it up on
[45:24] your own mind there's seven ads and the
[45:30] last ads the women got to it you we're
[45:33] covering it now on virtue I mean on the
[45:36] on charity coming to the last we've come
[45:40] through dealing with all of the virtues
[45:42] and things up to where that we got to
[45:44] brotherly kindness and we're brother
[45:48] branham covers I did in that whole
[45:50] message I gave you the quotes where you
[45:52] wouldn't think I was twisting it do
[45:54] wrong brother Branham says the six
[45:56] church age was Philadelphia then he says
[46:04] the age that we're living in now is
[46:07] brotherly kindness and that's the
[46:10] seventh church age now what are you
[46:13] saying brother Branham
[46:19] when I like is the one that I gave you
[46:22] you have it somewhere in here
[46:30] my brother branham explains he said to
[46:33] sit the seventh church age the sixth
[46:36] church age flows over into the seventh
[46:38] you know how each age was they flowed
[46:40] over into the other like a star snip he
[46:43] said the sixth church age flowed over
[46:46] into the seventh he says seven church
[46:49] age is really just to carry on of the
[46:50] sixth so the age of itself and the
[46:57] virtue for that age in comparison to the
[47:02] things of that age it's brotherly
[47:05] kindness the virtue of the six church
[47:07] age that goes into brotherly kindness
[47:10] but just curious or I don't over into
[47:12] the seven to carry it on into brotherly
[47:15] kindness being the message to the
[47:17] seventh but did you listen let me get to
[47:24] this honor did you listen I've listened
[47:30] three times so far so I think order know
[47:33] whether you say you said so-and-so will
[47:35] come and show me than I said so-and-so
[47:36] I'll tell you whether it's right or not
[47:38] good I done heard it three times this
[47:39] week
[47:45] you see the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:47] the Prophet said on blasphemous names
[47:53] he said the messenger was pouring the
[47:57] water of the sister Sheppard's dream
[48:00] into the rock box but said it run out
[48:03] and bought out all of the trash he said
[48:08] then said he took honey and poured it in
[48:14] and he said honey held right because he
[48:20] said the Holy Ghost no age can hold a
[48:22] Holy Ghost he said the individuals hold
[48:25] all the flesh not the age or anything
[48:27] like that it can't be done all right so
[48:30] then what was he saying the Holy Ghost
[48:34] that you receive as your new birth
[48:35] begins to start bawling out all of the
[48:38] trash I said it begins because it it has
[48:43] a long journey in most of us and I'll
[48:45] agree with that that we all have
[48:49] problems with this that or the other
[48:51] that's why I'm trying to teach it the
[48:53] way I have and never been to a point of
[48:55] people saying well I'm born again bless
[48:57] God I'm perfect you can only be perfect
[49:01] in Jesus Christ so now what do you
[49:03] saying are you saying you're perfect are
[49:08] you saying he's perfect which one's
[49:10] right
[49:10] we know he's perfect and if he comes and
[49:13] lives in us then he's still perfect
[49:16] living in us but he said he said what
[49:20] was that water he said that was that
[49:22] Holy Ghost boiling out all that trash
[49:26] right and he said it won't hold it run
[49:29] out and run down
[49:32] he said but then he took honey and
[49:35] poured it in and he said it didn't look
[49:39] like it was gonna hold but he said it
[49:42] did hold and he said brotherly kindness
[49:45] is what the honey represents and he said
[49:49] Darby is this age because that's where
[49:51] we've had on blasphemous name paragraph
[49:53] 125 and the honey represented brotherly
[49:58] love brotherly kindness which is the age
[50:01] I just got through telling see of
[50:04] brotherly kindness the age that we live
[50:07] in now so then there's a compound
[50:13] meaning of the Holy Ghost there's a
[50:15] compound meaning in the point of of
[50:18] brotherly love you can have Philadelphia
[50:23] as being brotherly love and you can have
[50:25] it the church age and you can have it
[50:27] with a great missionary endeavor to send
[50:29] to the world that was brotherly kindness
[50:30] but that was not the full meaning of
[50:33] brotherly kindness because they were I
[50:35] told you then the other day they was
[50:37] true and false into that there was true
[50:43] and false into that age but what about
[50:46] when you come to a message that is so
[50:49] pure until honey is the only thing
[50:55] hidden represent it with and he said he
[50:58] poured the honey in and he said to honey
[51:01] he'll and he said that's a very age that
[51:04] we're living in now
[51:07] is the age of brotherly cognition do you
[51:12] see what it's getting at the Holy Ghost
[51:14] is getting greater and greater to me the
[51:16] growth development each one of these now
[51:19] listen each one of these is a birth
[51:22] you're born in the faith you've birthed
[51:24] into virtue vert and the knowledge birth
[51:26] into tempers he said well I didn't know
[51:28] we had that many births a birth means
[51:32] they're coming forth in to get you dicks
[51:35] in there in just look I mean coming
[51:36] forth into a baby is born into the world
[51:40] it comes forth into the world right and
[51:44] says these virtue is that if God is
[51:47] birthing that sealing it in but you're
[51:55] gonna prove within the seal hold it or
[51:57] not because one day you're gonna seal
[52:01] the whole thing you go not seal the
[52:07] whole thing that was what I was trying
[52:08] to get you to see Wednesday so the honey
[52:12] that poured in is a whole lot greater
[52:15] sealed in water because that honey would
[52:18] hold its the deeper understanding of the
[52:22] Holy Ghost and what God is doing right
[52:26] he gave these virtue to each age and
[52:29] sealing that in brings us to the basis
[52:32] of whether that would deal with
[52:35] brotherly love during the six thirty
[52:38] eggs flow that right on over into the
[52:43] seventh church age and you got brotherly
[52:46] kindness because in the seventh church
[52:49] age he's not only pouring the message in
[52:52] now listen listen to what I tried to say
[52:54] Winston let's see if you got it he was
[52:57] pouring in the message to bawl out the
[53:00] trash
[53:04] come on then he brought his own message
[53:13] he wouldn't listen to that Wednesday
[53:21] you said well young is missing no see
[53:24] you got a poor in the faith of the
[53:25] fathers you got to come up the Statue of
[53:30] a perfect man to where it comes to the
[53:34] basis that you can be able to comprehend
[53:36] the seals brother Browns message never
[53:39] begun in 4846 come on and give you quote
[53:43] after quote but especially like the
[53:44] rapture his message begun after the
[53:49] opener or as the opening of the seals
[53:50] right in 262s right at the end of 62
[53:54] going into 63 he goes and starts looking
[53:57] in the forty and the fifties or sixties
[53:59] in especially in fact spoken words
[54:02] regional seat he brought the message to
[54:05] show the faith of the fathers read the
[54:08] spoken words regional see he brings a
[54:11] message to show the faith of the fathers
[54:13] and showing that he taught it correctly
[54:16] but then he says Lord what will I do I
[54:19] got him out on the limb he said where
[54:22] can I go from here
[54:24] now you remember reading that spoken
[54:26] word regional seat he said got him out
[54:28] on the limb and what did God say said
[54:31] pick up your pen and write he picked up
[54:35] his pen and he verified the exact
[54:37] message that brother Branham was
[54:39] preaching he wrote it read that part
[54:42] where he said the Holy Ghost said pick
[54:44] up your pen and write within when it
[54:47] finished they come to that same spot
[54:49] that he was worried about what was he
[54:51] gonna do
[54:54] and what did God say as of yet now read
[54:59] it and see if I'm telling you the truth
[55:00] spoken word written you'll see as I've
[55:03] yet
[55:03] Malakai for is not fulfilled brother
[55:08] Adam thought in the fifties in the early
[55:10] sixties at Malachi 4 was fulfilled it
[55:12] was for what it was supposed to be
[55:17] that's what I told you Wednesday night
[55:19] please listen to what wage say get away
[55:24] from your baby ideas and opinions and
[55:27] listen those disciples never taught
[55:33] anything about the son of man old
[55:36] Matthew Mark Luke and John wrote about
[55:38] it come on but they never taught nothing
[55:40] in their doctrine about it
[55:41] show me where Paul even taught about the
[55:45] Son of Man he taught it all the way up
[55:49] to the chains and never mentioned son of
[55:51] man here comes a prophet in the 50s
[55:56] right about 1950 and he starts talking
[55:59] about son of man sure he had some
[56:03] scruples in there that needed to be
[56:05] straightened out later on that he had a
[56:06] straight Knight himself nobody else
[56:08] could do it
[56:09] all right but there was things he was
[56:12] looking for like I said he thought was
[56:13] poking words originally he thought he
[56:16] had preached
[56:16] milik I for now you have to take this
[56:21] for mouths word of mouth as a brother in
[56:24] this message he's dead and going on now
[56:26] but he told that he asked brother
[56:29] Branham said are you not this like
[56:31] melikhaya forward things like that are
[56:33] you not that he says yes brother but
[56:38] said you can't tell it now that was the
[56:42] words of a man you will go to judgment
[56:44] and meet him there and let him answer
[56:46] what he's talking about
[56:47] but that was his words he said brother
[56:48] Branham said but you can't tell it
[56:54] why because it wouldn't time he gets the
[56:57] spoken word reading her seat he sees it
[56:59] the Holy Spirit says that of yet Malachi
[57:02] 4 was not fulfilled well what did he set
[57:04] out to do
[57:06] that's what I said you tied her home
[57:08] about the lifes of 62 and then you got
[57:10] brother ins ministry for three and a
[57:12] half years to compile the same as the
[57:14] Lord Jesus with the red line which you
[57:17] got him as I said in the rapture an
[57:19] event not in the age of preparation not
[57:22] in the age of the healing camera but
[57:24] said when he began to sound forth his
[57:26] message do you believe that or do you
[57:30] need for me to get him to pull it up if
[57:35] you want it pull it up raise your hand
[57:36] we'll get him back the artist to do it
[57:38] but he says that as of yet Malachi 4 he
[57:44] sets out to fulfil Malachi 4 he knows
[57:47] right then that there's something wrong
[57:49] with the way he was hidden and he
[57:53] brought his own message come on church
[57:57] that's all I was trying to tell you
[57:59] Wednesday night the Holy Ghost of the
[58:01] faith of the fathers were balled out all
[58:02] the trash if you wouldn't listening in
[58:06] are you listening now the Holy Ghost of
[58:09] the faith of the fathers will boil all
[58:10] the trash out they can't be no Christ
[58:13] left when you come to the faith of the
[58:14] Father come on you can't have any
[58:19] because when you come to the faith of
[58:21] the father's you don't come up through
[58:22] here and you don't got rid of this
[58:24] problem with your tongue and with your
[58:26] temper and you got rid of this part here
[58:28] you got rid of these you got rid of all
[58:30] these things and you're coming out with
[58:31] the faith of the father's then it can be
[58:34] capped off when you gonna get it this
[58:37] morning but we'll get to it then that
[58:39] can be capped off reach statue of a
[58:41] perfect man over again and notice all
[58:43] that wrote around says Holy Ghost coming
[58:46] down through now boy he talks funny
[58:49] don't it Holy Ghost coming down through
[58:53] Christ Holy Spirit welding all of this
[58:55] together
[58:57] read the ball and see if he said it we
[59:04] got to that part
[59:06] we're still on brother the kindness we
[59:09] tried to title it charity we'll pull it
[59:11] back and change it 7 adds change the
[59:14] title brothers joke - 7 adds instead of
[59:16] because we ain't getting to where I want
[59:18] to on love or charity I'm trying to get
[59:24] you to see church that brother Brendan's
[59:28] message went into a higher form you have
[59:31] to admit this that when he comes up to
[59:34] 260 to 63 and the sealed open that the
[59:38] message went into a greater depth right
[59:41] went into the things that had never been
[59:44] known by no man no man understood those
[59:52] times had never been spoken it was
[59:55] sealed up in the pyramid the same
[59:59] pyramid that the sister had to dream
[1:00:05] she had to dream about the statute of
[1:00:08] perfect man the statute of perfect man
[1:00:10] is identically with of the virtues and
[1:00:13] the ages and the things coming to work
[1:00:15] that there's a topknot didn't put home
[1:00:20] see this message then went from just
[1:00:22] being balling out to trash that all have
[1:00:25] been done by the faith of the fathers
[1:00:27] seems now listen come on now listen to
[1:00:29] what I'm saying
[1:00:29] I've told you 40-something years that
[1:00:32] when you're born again at faith you have
[1:00:35] eternal life your soul is just as
[1:00:37] eternal as it will ever be but we still
[1:00:41] have problems we have troubles and
[1:00:46] problems and things but I swear the
[1:00:48] statue of a perfect man proves it
[1:00:50] we still got temperance bless God I
[1:00:55] ain't got no temper well why did you
[1:00:57] face red solves that problem but you see
[1:01:03] what I've taught all alone try to get
[1:01:05] you to see see then when the prophets
[1:01:08] message went into a higher form through
[1:01:10] the opening of the seals
[1:01:11] there's your honey that's being poor to
[1:01:15] him that's what causes the cap to come
[1:01:18] down that's what causes it to do and it
[1:01:21] seals in because like I said Wednesday
[1:01:24] you just count those two down because
[1:01:26] they will draw it out we already drawed
[1:01:28] it before and showed rather and said
[1:01:29] there's a little flange up there it
[1:01:31] doesn't show as the drawing on the
[1:01:33] statue of a perfect man but there's a
[1:01:34] little flange you can draw it one way or
[1:01:37] draw it the other way don't make no
[1:01:38] difference there's a flange connecting
[1:01:40] these two together don't lower the
[1:01:41] headstone leave it right where it's at
[1:01:43] if you bring it down it won't fit it'll
[1:01:48] be too small it'll hang over you feel
[1:01:50] mad we'll go do it leave it right where
[1:01:53] it's at
[1:01:54] let the Holy Spirit filling in let the
[1:01:59] honey let the honey of the Holy Spirit
[1:02:03] fill that in so much until when the head
[1:02:06] does set on through and the natural
[1:02:08] you'd have to set it down on it but in
[1:02:10] the spiritual you don't have to set it
[1:02:12] down on it you let it build up growing
[1:02:15] up into him
[1:02:17] and that's what I've always taught you
[1:02:19] to be that headstone is the revealing of
[1:02:23] God's Word I've always taught you I
[1:02:24] believe the headstone it's the opening
[1:02:26] of the seven seals you tell me something
[1:02:28] else it is there's a lot of things that
[1:02:31] this is that that is that but it comes
[1:02:33] down to the opening of the seven seals
[1:02:35] oh there's honey in the rock my brother
[1:02:44] what about this message but coming to
[1:02:47] honey the two messengers pouring in his
[1:02:52] message they will tie together the
[1:02:55] headstone with the body because listen
[1:03:00] church if you do to look at it and see
[1:03:02] it if this thing was drawn correctly
[1:03:05] because you can't draw it but if this
[1:03:08] thing was drawn correctly that would fit
[1:03:09] right here or fit right here and there's
[1:03:12] four sides to the pyramid so the
[1:03:14] headstone would fit any of the four
[1:03:16] corners you just turn it over
[1:03:21] also this entire pyramid is right there
[1:03:26] that's the entire pyramid the the faith
[1:03:31] of the fathers brings you up but this
[1:03:34] message brought what what did the
[1:03:36] prophets say in the sealed book
[1:03:39] he said by the opening of the seven
[1:03:42] seals
[1:03:42] he said we understand the mystery of
[1:03:45] justification the mystery of
[1:03:51] sanctification were that these people
[1:03:55] understood we go back to the faith of
[1:03:58] the fathers and we take it on to the
[1:04:01] finishing it's been talked to your
[1:04:07] church but yet you just do you take it
[1:04:13] as listening well I don't know whether
[1:04:17] that's true or not we'll come and tell
[1:04:19] me but no you go tell everybody else
[1:04:22] I've told you before you go do that you
[1:04:26] are causing schism in the body and
[1:04:28] you'll answer here or there ain't going
[1:04:34] there what's on I didn't say that
[1:04:36] there's gonna be an answer the deeds
[1:04:37] done in the body whether good or bad
[1:04:39] according to the Bible not the white
[1:04:42] throne we don't go to that but we're
[1:04:44] gonna give an account somewhere so you
[1:04:46] go ahead and talk among yourselves why
[1:04:50] don't you come and ask me what I'm
[1:04:51] talking about I don't know what he's
[1:04:54] talking about to you once you come and
[1:04:57] ask me what I'm talking about see you're
[1:05:01] the one that's causing the confusion
[1:05:03] because you won't come and ask me that
[1:05:06] schism in the body of Christ read your
[1:05:08] Bible to see what schism is
[1:05:11] people contrary to the word taking their
[1:05:14] ideas and opinions it leaves coming ask
[1:05:17] me I'll be glad to sit down with you for
[1:05:21] a week and talk about this time what I'm
[1:05:26] not going to run you down
[1:05:28] just cold I think you got some idea
[1:05:34] you're going to have to straighten that
[1:05:36] out in your own mind to decide what
[1:05:39] truth is that's why this doors back
[1:05:43] guard was made going where they'll go
[1:05:45] get away ain't never run nobody off and
[1:05:49] don't want to run nobody how but there's
[1:05:50] one thing about it the Word of God will
[1:05:53] eventually get us so why not get it now
[1:06:02] yes but brother so-and-so sister I
[1:06:04] didn't know brother so-and-so was the
[1:06:06] pastor of this church right I thought
[1:06:13] she's supposed to go to the pastor to
[1:06:15] find out what's going on I didn't know
[1:06:17] you're supposed to go with each other
[1:06:19] what you see Church that's where you
[1:06:23] don't know don't follow it you
[1:06:25] understand let me say it one more time
[1:06:27] and go through you're born again at
[1:06:29] faith by the new birth that was the
[1:06:33] 3,000 people outside that Apostles was
[1:06:36] born again right here where it says Holy
[1:06:39] Spirit that was their part because they
[1:06:42] have the faith of the father they were
[1:06:45] taught three-and-a-half years and when
[1:06:47] the Holy Ghost that failed they even
[1:06:49] twice in your scriptures we've given in
[1:06:51] the Book of Luke on those one but it
[1:06:53] says he opened their understanding of
[1:06:56] the scriptures that was before Calvary
[1:06:58] before he even I mean before the coming
[1:07:01] of the Holy Ghost on the day of
[1:07:03] Pentecost he opened their understanding
[1:07:05] of the scriptures but he didn't give him
[1:07:07] the new birth he breathed on him in John
[1:07:10] and said receive ye the Holy Ghost with
[1:07:12] brother Owen said that was a promise
[1:07:16] he didn't fulfill it right there I was a
[1:07:18] promise they went to the upper room and
[1:07:22] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:26] he had opened their understanding of the
[1:07:28] scriptures until they knew a lot of
[1:07:30] things which were 3,000 outside it heard
[1:07:35] one sermon it made them newborn babies
[1:07:38] desiring the sincere milk of the word
[1:07:42] and Peter says okay you're born again
[1:07:47] I'm writing this to those that are born
[1:07:49] again is that what he said anyway he
[1:07:52] said well now listen you've got to come
[1:07:55] to these virtues to have what we have
[1:07:59] well I got the Holy Ghost praise God but
[1:08:04] that ain't all the Holy Ghost the new
[1:08:07] birth is not all of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:08] there's a group development of children
[1:08:10] in Christ just as natural burst you see
[1:08:18] that Holy Ghost has been trying its best
[1:08:19] to help us what have I taught you from
[1:08:24] the very beginning 327 church age book
[1:08:26] this messenger Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 will
[1:08:29] do two things 1 turn the hearts of the
[1:08:30] children back to the faith of the father
[1:08:32] to reveal the seven thunders which are
[1:08:34] the revelation contained in the seven
[1:08:35] seals
[1:08:36] it'll be these divinely revealed mystery
[1:08:38] truths that literally turn our hearts
[1:08:39] back now that's a verbatim quote order
[1:08:42] to be able to quote it for 50 years
[1:08:47] because that's what I saw fifty years
[1:08:49] ago right at it 47
[1:08:58] but has your group development brought
[1:09:01] you to understanding of the word because
[1:09:07] we got to come back to flex the fathers
[1:09:09] before you can even talk about these
[1:09:10] other thing see that's been my key the
[1:09:13] whole time
[1:09:15] everybody talks about to seal tonight
[1:09:17] okay but they don't tell you they're so
[1:09:19] scared of it until they won't talk to
[1:09:21] somebody that knows and only you get all
[1:09:25] upset at me for making a statement but
[1:09:27] go home and take your Daniel 70 weeks
[1:09:29] book and open the front page and read
[1:09:32] the little insert that's in the I think
[1:09:34] it's the front page with a little insert
[1:09:36] it says if you don't understand the
[1:09:39] Daniel 70 weeks you cannot understand
[1:09:42] the seals the plagues the vials and the
[1:09:44] thought but who wants to talk about
[1:09:46] Daniel seventy weeks
[1:09:54] they don't talk about it like I told you
[1:09:57] we've said in meetings were out of 20
[1:10:00] ministers 10 of them didn't even have a
[1:10:01] book lotta man never read the message
[1:10:06] where they could tell you all about it
[1:10:12] the people around it to us all they hear
[1:10:15] well brother so-and-so straighten him
[1:10:17] out on that he stumped in that floor up
[1:10:19] at Lula one day and just shattered the
[1:10:21] roof and the bottom before he's
[1:10:23] straighten about
[1:10:26] no no he didn't straighten out nothing
[1:10:33] he just showed us he's old how
[1:10:35] illiterate he was he needed temperance
[1:10:39] and he definitely needed patience to
[1:10:42] wait on us right but do you understand
[1:10:47] what I'm getting at you understand what
[1:10:49] I was trying to get at Wednesday the
[1:10:51] Prophet was pouring the message into the
[1:10:54] church to boil it out
[1:10:55] that's the statue of a perfect man
[1:10:57] that'll boil out everything but see then
[1:11:00] the seals opened from that and there's
[1:11:03] your honey that seals the whole thing
[1:11:07] together in brotherly love
[1:11:08] no wonder it'll hold no wonder it'll
[1:11:16] hold
[1:11:17] what are you concerned I called a man
[1:11:22] just recently that I had already told
[1:11:25] him if I ever ever any trouble about
[1:11:29] what we're we're differed that just to
[1:11:31] forgive me by sitting there studying on
[1:11:33] the statue of a perfect land and
[1:11:35] brotherly kindness we're brother Branham
[1:11:37] says under that brotherly kindness he
[1:11:40] said you ate together
[1:11:43] you talked together and he said you're
[1:11:46] brothers I just reached over got the
[1:11:48] phone and called him I said brother I
[1:11:50] want you to know one time if there's
[1:11:53] anything that I've ever said or done
[1:11:54] towards you would you forgive me
[1:11:57] I said I'm studying on brotherly
[1:11:59] kindness so I think I need brotherly
[1:12:01] kindness but would you forgive me he
[1:12:03] said yes and you forgive me if he said
[1:12:05] this I'm not
[1:12:07] well I'm trying my best
[1:12:13] what are you doing - good minds patience
[1:12:18] coz the Lord told me that he said if
[1:12:20] you'll have patience with the people
[1:12:21] that approve you had patience well
[1:12:23] they've been tried strongly been tried -
[1:12:29] worth it I don't do too good on patience
