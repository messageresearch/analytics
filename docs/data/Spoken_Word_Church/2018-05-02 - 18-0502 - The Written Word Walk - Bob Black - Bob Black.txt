I want to see I want to see [Music] [Applause] [Music] to power in love holy holy [Music] more after powering on [Music] Oh Oh Oh [Music] I want to see a man I saw about desires tonight let's get get ready to look at Matthew chapter 14 2016 20 9 and Psalm chapter 40 everybody come expecting tonight you know brother Brown said expected blessing and the blessing that I'm looking for when I come to church is a change I want to be changed I want to be changed from the creature that I once was from the creature that I am now to keep being changed every day every step that I take to keep being changed until we take that final change so that's the blessing that I'm looking forward to night let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we would get into the scripture we bow our heads well God we're so grateful to be able to come together and gather together around your people Lord Jesus and I kind of a great blessing to be able to to look at upon your bride and just speak to her Lord this this privilege lady Lord and I pray God that you'll give me the words to treat her right tonight Lord Jesus Lord I feel like maybe David with his little sling Lord Jesus when he let loose that rock Lord all I got is a rock but I've got I've got your word tonight Lord Jesus and I pray God that you'll guide it to where it hit its mark and grant that Lord Jesus that you'll come upon the scene the night Lord God and anoint your word that it won't just go out and involve oil Lord Jesus but we know we've got the promise of your scripture that's your word when will never return void but it'll accomplish it'll produce what it was written what it was said that it would do and that's what we're expecting tonight Lord God that your word will produce a change that it won't just fall forward but it'll produce something us in us Lord and so we're trusting Lord God for that change we ask your blessing upon this the reading of the word the hearing of it Lord tonight and we invite you Lord that you'll come and be welcome Lord Lord here tonight we open up we've opened up the doors to the church Lord and now we open up the doors of our heart Lord God and we pray Lord that you'll just feel welcome and move among us Lord Jesus sit on the pews with us and be welcome Lord God we pray when he asked us these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so let's read I'm gonna preach a little sermon on works tonight we we know we preached a lot about faith I'm gonna preach about works so let's let's start on Matthew 14 26 29 and maybe the top of God take tonight is you know brother Branham talked about how he liked those three word topics and I'm gonna take a three word topic called the written word walk and so we read here in verse 26 and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were trouble saying it as a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid and Peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus and now let's read Psalm chapter 40 verses 78 which says then said I lo I come and the volume of the book it is written of me I delight to do thy will o my God gave our law is within my heart that you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word and I will take a starter drink of water so we're reading in this scripture if we wanted to go back a little bit and see how this how this all started Jesus was he was teaching the ones that there that on this on the seaside and and they began to sin brother Brown tells it and the testimony on the sea and many other script messages that he preached about how maybe they were saying their goodbyes and they were all how it's so hard to say goodbye to like when you get together with a fellowship even here at our church when you when you get to leave it whizzed a nice and whatever it's it's so hard to say goodbye because it's like you know you get around that front that good fellowship the honey starts flowing and and you can't hardly leave one another and I believe that's the way it's supposed to be well you you love one another something's being manifested you something's drawn you in and it was so it was real hard for them to say goodbye and they were waving and everything and and Jesus told him you know there's one there's one scripture where it says Jesus knew that they were about to make him King so he he set things in motion to kind of get out of there and he said his disciples because it wasn't time and you know you look at the type of how the Scriptures laid out how this little story is laid out there's things at the beginning and at the end that the parallel a lot of things that have happened down through the seven Church ages and things like that but at any rate he he began to tell him to go ahead on out on the water take their boat and go ahead on on to the other side and and he'd catch up with him a little bit later and and there he went and he went on up to the on up to the top of a mountain where he could observe and brother Brennan tells us that you know it's like he climbed up to the cross he clipped climbing on up to the ramparts where he could watch over us and down through the seven Church ages down and watch it and keep an eye on us and and and help us and minister to us in that way and so so they went and they they began to they left Jesus and they they went on out and into the water and the testimony in the sea brother branham release how they begin to talk about the things that they had seen and maybe I want to just kind of reflect on the night that they were there they had they had heard and seen a lot of things they had heard and seen a lot you think they saw how jesus had broke the bread and I hate you fed 5,000 with five little biscuits and and how he had He healed the blind and and and all the great miracles and the signs and things that had been doing and he they had heard him talk about things and and they so they were holding these things in their heart and they began to tell one another they began to testify and relate all these things and as they were beginning to testify our storm one whirls up and that's that's just like the devil as soon as you began to test it behind here here comes something we were actually riding in the car and-and-and a friend of ours that my wife knows I'm gonna use this this is this is fresh a friend at my wife knows he's preaching at another church tonight and whatever again they were texting back and forth talking about how as soon as you get ready to preach the devil will come around and start making the kids aggravate it makes making them deuce it's like as soon as you start talking about the Lord then here come the kids in there to pull at you and do stuff or whatever that's not the kids really it's it it's the devil's trying to disrupt things he tries to he tries to get in there and cause a disruption and so the devil you know I wanna I want to get down to the nitty-gritty tonight because the devil what he does is he causes a disturbance so much especially in this day and this day there are so many storms in people's lives there's so many things that rose up there's things like depression and complexes listen depression or the devil will give you a storm of depression where you feel like nobody cares about you and everybody hates you you start feeling all down and everything that maybe even God doesn't care about you but I want to I want to declare to you tonight that God gave his spirit has assigned to you that he loves you he sent ministers behind the pulpit to declare to you that he loves you and you start feeling all down and everything and you get a complex because somebody said something to you somebody said something one time and you build up this big old complex that will hang on with you all your life and see what what happened was that the this storm rose up and and maybe that the disciples were sitting there in the boat and they began to think within their minds that there was no deliverance from that storm that that storm was going to take them down and drag them to the bottom of the sea and maybe tonight you're sitting here with a storm in your life something happening that maybe your children going out in the world things going wrong you're in danger of losing your job things going wrong at work and you think that life that storms are gonna drag you down but I want to declare to you tonight that there is a power of God that is able to deliver you there is there's something I'm speaking on words tonight that faith is going to produce something if you believe God it will produce something God can come upon the scene and deliver you he can deliver you from your depression he can deliver you from your complexes he can deliver you from your addiction he can deliver you from the idea that it's too late to be saved that it's too late you look around the world and think see all the signs and the things that are taking place and and you start getting a fearful idea a fearful mind and you think well it's it's too late for me to understand the things that are in the message it's too late for me to have a relationship with God but it's not too late while the message is still being preached while the gospel is still being proclaimed you can still come to the altar and I want to declare to you tonight that the altar is still waiting for those that are that are we love that something's pulsating within their heart the altar is still there I still believe in the old sawdust trail I still believe in the in the and a dying out a killing a little yourself a dumping out so that you can be filled that's what I believe that's what I stand for tonight I believe that God is able to deliver you from the battles of life no matter what anybody else says what no matter what anybody else you hear anybody else that go back to the word and see what the word says and the word will always have a positive confession for you when you look into the word and see you can't look into the word and see anything but something positive because God's word he was positive he is able he is a deliverer of the word is able is it's available for you if you'll just open the door of your heart and believe it and receive it so the storm rose up and and here they look down and they saw and in the storm the one thing that would save them the one thing that could deliver them and they got scared of her here came if you could imagine as the the night the night came on it says in the fourth watches of the night the storm came up that when it was the darkest and they begin to look at how to prune the upon the water and they and they saw something moving it could you imagine being out on the dark I've heard the stories of people they get they fall off of ocean liners and stuff in there and they're floating out in the middle of the water and they say it's one of the scariest things because you you're afraid something's going to tickle you and your bottom of your feet you see the lights moving and as you begin to be fearful and so there they were out in the middle of the ocean out in the middle of that senior they they're looking out and they and they see something moving that that's past explaining they can't understand it I want to tell you it's a paradox you know what a paradox is a paradox is something that looks like it's wrong or you don't understand it until closer examination but when you look at a little bit closer it starts to make sense it begins to come in to come into reality what it really is a paradox when you first look at it it looks like something's something's off something's off-kilter and that's how people look at the gospel when they see God moving when they see God moving in a church in a situation like think of when somebody rises up and begins to speak in tongues that it just scares them when they feel the anointing of the Holy Spirit it scares them when they see people falling out in the aisle or running and screaming and shouting it scares them remember that your kid if you've ever taught if your kids have ever asked you why are you crying Mama and Daddy why what are you crying about what what's going on because the first time you see the presence of the Lord the first time you see it it scares you you don't know what what's going on but that's the only thing that could help you and people that people looked at brother Brent knows the message and they thought what I don't understand this is this man is he he's speaking he's telling people what's in their life it is discerning things he's speaking the things that it's in their heart and it's scared I'm instead of running to it the only thing that could help them they ran away from it many of them and so here all these people in this boat the disciples that had been taught that had been shown the things they had listened to Jesus talking and do all these things and I want to maybe say that they had a good mechanical understanding they had a good intellectual understanding of what the message was all about but I believe that the end of this day we need more than just the intellectual understanding we need something that we can walk home we need a substance and so Peter was the only one out of that whole boat load I want to ask you this morning there to die why was Peter the only one that stepped out of that boat why was he the only one you know you you ask yourself that question a lot of times in meetings and everything why doesn't everybody come up to the altar why and everybody clamoring to be saved why and everybody screaming and cried for deliverance but there's not there's just a few there's only there's a there's only going to be a few that will take a hold of God's Word and meet him and go out to meet him how can I walk on that water - can I walk the way that you're walking and I want to say maybe tonight you know what Peter took that first step he didn't take that first step just guessing he didn't take it presuming but I believe that many of us today are presuming that we've got the new birth and this is not a time for presuming anything do you know when this when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost all the presume and went out the window and every fiber of their being was filled with the Holy Ghost all of their sisters were overcome they they saw with their eyes the pillar of fire over each of their head they heard with their ears that with wind rushing through the building they spoke the word as they went outside they walked with their feet that their feet was shod with the preparation of peace they every fiber of their being the only thing I could imagine that maybe they didn't smell it but I believe they smelled maybe the cold off the altar because every fiber of their being they weren't presuming anymore you know I believe that we sometimes we we're scared of sensations and everything we know sensations and emotions is not the evidence but sometimes I want a blessing from God I want something real that I know that that there's some real gods that I'm walking in truth that I'm walking in the right way listen this is more than just psychology it's more than just just a philosophy that some somebody's got it's something real you know I think sometimes we we get so intellectual her he has it if somebody was gonna come down to their altar would sit back and say well that's God right way you don't need to do all that so kind of stuff and somebody will just stand up and scream you you sit back we'll say well that's not right you don't need to do all that kind of stuff well because we've been listening that the mechanics is supposed to make a way for the dynamics this month not supposed to block the dynamics just supposed to pay the way for the dynamics winded up when the mechanics have been sown then the dynamics have a way to come and quicken do you know that's the definite the difference between the Baptism and I Holy Ghost that that's what it confuses everybody what's the difference between the baddest and the Holy Ghost and the new birth the new birth is when the word has been sown and there's something to be quickened when the baptism it only goes cutting upon the word then it's a birth it produces something it produces a substance that you can walk on let me kiss my breath I don't mean to yell at you listen listen this message is not just an argument this message is not just a mechanical argument we sit around and we're born again because we can argue one another now we could we could say one person is right or one person is wrong that's not what this message is about you know you can get some mechanical it's you you overlook the working of the Spirit you can overlook what's going on in your life what's going on in the life of the church you think about do you think about when when uh what Jesus went up to the Pool of Bethesda and he was looking for somebody that looking for that man with that face that they could really believe that and he bypassed all the other ones that there that were waiting for that water that to stir them at the Pool of Bethesda and there he told him rise up take up your bed and walk but he believed him and you know the Pharisees were all sitting around and they could open up their Bible I lost my regular Bible so I've got this big giant Bible here today but they got they got they could open up their Bible anchor they could don't go on Old Testament they can see where that you wasn't supposed to do no work on the Sabbath they could prove it by the scriptures they can look into the world and see you're not supposed to do nothing on the sap but they didn't have the spirit to tell them the correct interpretation of that word so when that man rose up on the Sabbath all they had was that intellectual understand that they didn't know what it was and I want to declare to you we need the Spirit of God to come and tell us what the real meaning of its victory is not just the intellectual understanding we're gonna think about when Jesus when Jesus was sitting there all the people that had sitting there in the corner of that house when that when that little woman came and watched his feet and she came up and washed his feet whenever but nobody else would pay him no mind and Judas that was Judas his turning point the Bible says from that time on because he looked on that and he couldn't prove it he couldn't understand what was going on why would you why would you spend the whole year's wage on pouring out all that oil on this man why would you take the whole year away that if you live if you run it out it comes out to about $20,000 $20,000 you're pouring out on this man's feet why would you do that why that doesn't even make a lick of sense and and it wouldn't ignore them with the spiritual that she was anointing him for his burial and it had to be done and Jesus said from now on everybody's going to tell this story over and over again because something was happening it was beyond what was just this is the intellectual the mental conception of what was written in the Bible it was beyond just what was on the page of the book and I want to tell you we've got to get beyond what's just written on the page of the book so that it's written in her life it's got to be written in you and I it's got to be written in us not just on the pages of the book and that's what's happening now as you eat as you eat and believe and yield yourself and doubt and you are becoming the word do you do you realize what that means do you realize that what what that means is that you have the opportunity to become this word if you'll just eat it and they eat it at I give up to yourself die lay outside all the most denominational ideas that you're still hanging on to you lay off that's supposed to die all that stuff of all your ideas that you're carrying on all yours all you are your the ways of the Baptist a lot taller the ways of the Agosto started all those things at the top and if you want to know what life is read the message reason message it'll make the Bible cover into a new book maybe I should calm down before I lose my voice listen I I need the exercise so Jesus said they're there we're in the boat there they were in the boat and and and Peter looks out and he sees this man walking on the water and he sees this man walking and you know that's how many of us started our journey we didn't start it maybe you know you I know many of us we heard the doctrine of service see we heard this something's real but what really caught our attention was the same thing that called Paul's attention when he saw Stephen dying there he saw God living in a man he saw something real God walking on the water and he looked out there and he said there's there's a man this hey how many times in your life have you have you turned around maybe in a church service and there was somebody that you highly respect you looked up to somebody that that you saw God into and you shake their hand and hold them to you how many times have you you you watched people's lives and you're like I want to be like that person that person inspires me because you see God in their life you know brother and preach the sermon influences that your life is the greatest influence when I walk out from this pulpit my life will be a greater preacher than anything that I could sing tonight anything that you say it's diminished in front of what your life is you can say all kinds of stuff but if you don't live the lives and that's why I believe that Christians are supposed to show the same life the same thing that was in Jesus Christ a life of humility and meekness and patience and all of these virtues all of these things and roll up in the one where you can you can walk up to somebody you could take fruit off of that tree and you can eat it and get strength from it because you see the life of God in them and that's what drew Peter to take a step from that boat he said can I do the same thing that you're doing listen he had heard all the things about the works that I do shall you do also he had heard it preached but now he wanted to see it in action can I do the same thing that you're doing and that's my message tonight faith will produce works you can do same thing you can live a godly life because when the life of Christ is in you it will produce something it produces the mechanics it will produce a substance that you can walk on it will produce and evidence the evidence of things not seen the evidence what you're looking something that's not visible something that's real more real than this pulpit listen Peter hurt Peter heard that voice say come and that voice was really today you might you might imagine putting put to think about where you are now that that voice is echoing from another world another world drawing you from here to there and Peter stepped out he stepped out onto the water and something held him up listen that's something that held him up it's the same thing that's holding you up right now it's not just to make believe but it's a real genuine substance it's a real genuine thing that's carrying you you walking on something as something that is a substance that ties you back to the eternal the substance of an eternal life it's living inside of you something that's real and if you have never tasted of that substance I declare you to you tonight that there is a substances you could take a hold of it's a real thing that you can have if you want it if you want it you got a wound in them you know brother Bram talked about how you'd have to you'd have to step over Jesus to go to hell you'd have to step over the cross after all the things that God has done all the things that he's laying in front of you and yet you still turn it aside to listen listen Church Peter you know Peter when he stepped out he he maybe he faced the ridicule of all the ones that were sitting in that boat what are you doing Peter who do you think you are that do you think that you can cast out devils that you think you can take up serpents you can drink deadly things who are you to think that you can fulfill the the promises of the scripture that the promise will be fulfilled in your members that you can walk this gospel walk and there's a minute look at you tonight's little girls or sisters with your long hair and your dress on that looks many that look at you and say I wish I could walk that walk I wish I could talk that tub but I can't because you've got to have a substance you gotta have real substance to walk this gospel walk anywhere the presence the person of Jesus Christ is the acts will follow you can bank on that list of there's many impersonations and all of those kind of things but I guarantee you where the person of Jesus Christ is acts will follow because Jesus that I believe in the promises that Jesus gave to the church that we should cast out devils and you know you know better man told us that when you're when you come to the age of accountability there's a spirit that's lingering on you there's a spirit that moves upon you that says that says wait just a little bit longer wait just a little bit take a hold of it and there might be that spirit on you tonight way just a little bit longer it's not for you whatever but I believe that God gave a commission to the church to cast out spirits and I want to cast that spirit out tonight I want to cast that out so you can believe to make a way open for you to believe that you can claim every promise and that's written in the scripture now you know another thing that word come jesus said just have one word come he didn't say a great big many things but you know Peter caught something that one word he doesn't have to explain it and give a great big gold dissertation but you know when you could catch it in the word and you can see it written in the scripture then you just step out on faith on that when a Christian a Christian don't even know how to act and silts you they see it in the word but when you see it in the word you're like oh that's what I'm supposed to be oh do you mean this powers for me do you mean that I don't have to put up with the devil no more do you mean that I can I can put in beneath my feet do you mean that there ain't nothing in this world that can hold me back now do you mean all these things with a Christian begins to look in the word and see what the word says then they know how to act and I don't mean any like put on but they know what they're going for there know what their aim is for and then they can go and seek God and say make this real to me make this live in me that's mine listen faith is good but I got to have both of those evidences you must have faith and works because faith without works is dead faith without works can be imitated you can say I've got faith like that little girl and that very sir first what a sermon that brother Graham preached where brother they said you say you've got all faith now move this little chandelier thing moving and she said well I can't do that because she was flummoxed that that you would anybody would be able in the realm of possibility but the Bible says that all things are possible to them to believe all things are possible everything is possible you know that maybe that floats many of us when you when you heard the story of brother Branham saying that he can take a pocketknife that you left in your dresser and then he could put it in your pocket if you're if you're forgotten it but I know many here tonight they can testify that they've seen situations where God has taken your car keys that you left at the store whatever and he's put them right there in front of you but I remember this - hearing a story when I was younger this man he said I lost my car keys I couldn't find him anywhere so me and his brother began that we laid our hands on the hood of the car on the hood of the car we began to call out to God and when we opened our eyes there was the car keys laying in front of us because all things are possible to them to believe faith will produce something and listen it'll produce more than just your car keys it'll produce your children back in your home it'll produce your kids back in your church if you apply the token and put that token to work if you confess it before God and say I'll believe that you promised it and that settles it because listen though in the world of God when when the substance is indwelling and you it speaks back to you and says it's already done let's ask what I believe that the still small voice that goes back when I still small voice speaks to you it will speak it's already done it's finished the battle is over it's already been won and that then all you have to do is just walk because the battle is already over let's remember quote number two in investments brother I'm talking about his insufficiency he said I'm not sufficient to stand here to talk about a thing like this it's more I cannot I cannot bring myself into the spot and I put myself to be a teacher I couldn't do that because I haven't got the intellectual knowledge listen he's not talking about intellectual knowledge to the word he's not talking about word that can't be quicker that can be quickened but he's talking about knowing all kind of ABCs and maybe they're having a great big capillary and all those kind of things yeah listen you know how you could be like petered not hardly know nothing and understand the gospel the gospel ain't supposed to be understood by people with a great big old huge hands it's for anybody to take a hold of grasp hold on if you think I can't you you're not smart enough or bright enough to understand the gospel then then just humble yourself and let God speak to you a few times you because I said listen that's a lie of the devil this ain't for smart people but I have a revelation that's exactly with the word and the word lives back and produces what is saying it dude see see neither did apostle he goes on to say because why because the word will produce what is saying it dude maybe that's my whole message tonight I think we go billable getting so built up on philosophies and all kind of things wondering if they're worth the message is really true wonder if it'll really work in your life and once you go to God and find out if it'll really work or not once you go to God and find out if it's really true and all you have to do to see if it's really true is to look around you and see all the lives that have been changed see all the lives have been made to conform to the word that had been brought into his image the problem is is that we don't realize that we're needful keep reading Matthew 14 29 to 32 and he said come and which Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried lord save me now how many of our walks are we get we get started and it starts out real good you go through when you get the new birth and all those things seems like it's going real good because you get through your honeymoon period with the Lord and everything is just wonderful never ever prayer you pray ever scripture read off it's just wonderful everything just Springs alive and then the devil turns his guns on you just like he did Jesus when he came from from the from the River Jordan and begin to walk into the wilderness and the devil because why do you the devil wants to see what's what you really made of the devil is actually acting as an instrument of God to test you and prove to you that you've got what you saved you and the devil begins to bang you on your sing is it really do you really know what you're talking about do you really have what you say you do and you people people get so discouraged so many times and they begin to think that God is not willing and they listen that's what that's what happened to Peter there in the boat he began to look at the storms and the winds and the waves all around him he began to look at his circumstances and he began to sink down into the into the mire of the winds and the waves and maybe maybe it was just his hand reached up his his hand went I'm gonna drop at eyes a little bit I'm gonna take some license here maybe his hand was the last thing to go and he's reaching Jesus help me Jesus and at just as he was about to sink down in the water Jesus came along now listen what kind of lesson can we learn there I think I think the lesson we did we can learn is that we need what we need is a guide we need some help we need some help to guide us along through life you know brother man I've talked about how that time he he looked at his true turning points in life that God showed him how he took him by the that mountain range that had his name and written in and now he showed him how his whole life could've been across the street how it how it could have been that that dump heap on the side of the road and he looked there and his name was inscribed on those mountain peaks it has seven peaks he kept getting bigger and bigger you know what that was he called an everlasting sign an everlasting sign to look at a memorial you know there's a lot of everlasting signs that brother Ellen talked about one was that a virgin shall conceive one was that wasn't that Jesus would rise from the dead an everlasting sign that God would reveal himself in flesh but he was walking down that mountain range he was walking down that through that mount those mounds of his life and you've got to walk the mountains of your life - you've got to take that same journey the same journey that Abraham took the same journey that brother Brown took the same three pools of your journey but to take that journey you need a guide you need a guide or you'll get lost but the problem is so many of us we think we think we don't need a guide you remember that story that Brennaman told about when he was preaching the guy he said I got out there in the woods on his honeymoon after he had taken his wife to Niagara Falls and he took her out on that hunting trip on their honeymoon and he said I got to thinking that I'm a wilderness man I know all about this situation I know how to tell which way the sun's rising and how to take care of myself at night when it gets cold and all these kind of things but then when the when the gloom rose in when there wouldn't win it when he after he had killed his deer and got all that situated and everything then they began to realize that he was lost and I think that's one of our dilemmas denied us is we don't realize or maybe you don't realize when you're lost that's what the gospel is for listen the gospel is to let you know when you're lost to let you know when you're not matching up with the word what the word says when you can look in this and say something's off with my life you hear them be the minister preaching and something's off I need something but you know you need something and he needed a guide and begin to cry out I need something and and it Eddy you know we still you know the story about he went through all the dough that if the things that finally he reached up and there was that telephone wire what we need is a phone line back to God and the phone line right here is this word where you can know what God's will is for you in this day and so we followed that guide he kept his hand on the guide he kept his hand on the phone line all the way back to his destination so I want to declare to you tonight don't let your hand off the wire don't let you don't get your eyes off Jesus like Peter did just stick right with the wire and it'll lead you right on to your destination because John chapter 16 verse 13 says howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth he will guide you through all the perils and this and the looked like setbacks of a scripture he'll lead you and guide you through all this truth and what it is is you're doing just like Peter did you're walking through this scripture it's a written word walk and you're taking one step at a time but the first step is the most important the first step that you take is like Peters first step the first step is when you realize that you lost and what you need to do is repent you know and when Elijah came on the scene there and they were in first Kings chapter 17 he said raining will not fall until I call for it and you know when rain would fall what the signal was for the rain to fall is when the people repented after all the things done with the pouring on the water of the altar and all the the killing the promise of bail then the people repented and the rain began to fall and that's what will trigger the rain to fall in your life is when you repent you need to repent repent every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin come up to the altar whether it's stand up in your seat and repent because you need this God you need it but you got to recognize your needs you must recognize that you need a God you got to recognize it like Peter recognized it when he thought he knew how to do it II thought I'm walking pretty good here I'm getting along pretty good and then he he thought he had it all figured out how many of us we think we got it all figured out because we read a little bit of the scripture we think we've got it all figured out for the beginning of the end but you know what you don't have nothing figured out like you think you do as Paul said if you think you have knowledge you don't have knowledge like you think you do if you don't have the guide because he's the one that will give you instruction he gave the promise but you've got to receive it and you know the thing Peter Peter got out there walking on the water and you know like so many of us do we think we think we're supposed to be the ones that are providing we're so we think we're the ones that are supposed to be living the life you're eating the scripture about how you're supposed to be acting a certain way or doing a certain thing and before long you're trying to put you're trying to put feathers in we're where they're not growing out naturally you're trying to prop up something you're trying to you're trying to make do and act a certain way instead of letting it be genuine you know the way I am I'd rather somebody just be genuine if if you can't hardly help certain a certain thing just to let it just let it be natural don't be put on don't let don't be fake I'd rather see somebody be genuine and true than somebody be fake anyway because you know what if you're just if you're just a genuine sinner and you're just genuine you're just a good old genuine sinner when the power the Holy Ghost comes on you and quickens the word that you've heard then you'll be a genuine the Holy Ghost filled believer and everybody will know it the transition will be a paired everybody will see that you've been transformed by the renewing of your mind it'll be out it'll be a right out there in the open just be genuine and everything that you do elicit Peter Peter walking on that water at least one thing he did was he cried out you know when I said another mistake many of us do we won't cry out for help we'll sit there while and then I better pain putting up with all the stuff that the devil puts on us just letting the devil do have his way with us just do whatever the devil or maybe it's the Lord's will for me to be depressed maybe it's the Lord is the middle wheel for me to just be just maybe I just can't live this old gospel way maybe I just can't do it but listen the gospel was sent the power of the Holy Ghost was sent so you don't have to put with the devil you don't have to sit with him riding on your coattails you don't have to sit with him parsnip on your shoulder you don't have to put up with the devil tonight there's a delivery deliverance for you the church was sitting it with the power to cast out Devils you don't have to live with that devil there's a deliverance for you just believe God's Word and accept it confess it and go on and believe it but you gotta take that first step let's look at let's look at quote number six I'm reading these all out of order but anyway the future home with a heavenly bridegroom brother Branham said now let's pick that before we read this quote when you leave it up there but picture in your mind Peter in that boat and he's wondering can I do what Jesus did he's doing it and he asked him can I come walking to you Peter says come and so Peter takes that first step what's your first step is a Christian brother branham explained what's your first step is he explained your first step in the church agents book explained it here in the future home and he said now the first step is repentance towards God and then follows after that your next step see look how do I start being a Christian how do I be a Christian you take your first step that's all it takes to be a Christian as you just put your foot out and lean on that substance and let it come down on that substance put your foot down and then you take another step and then you take another step and you just keep walking until you see God's Word being manifested in your life and you keep walking and you keep stepping until it'll be written of you he walked like Enoch did even walk with God and he was not found and you were walking you're walking till you'll take another step and one day you won't be found anymore but you got to take that first step and then take that first step you got to lay a hot lay aside all the the you got to not care anymore you got to not care what people think about you you got to not care what your friends think what your friends think on Facebook or Instagram or whatever who cares if they see you shouting and screaming or crying in the middle of the church who cares if if they see you doing something that seems unseemly to the world but to the group to them to the Christian is righteousness who cares what anybody says if if they see the mascara running down your face because something got ahold of you who cares what the world thinks that's our problem as we care too much what the other people in the boat think of us we're looking too much of the other people in the boat and say oh nobody else has stepped out so I can't step out you be the first one if you think the church ain't lively enough you be the first one you be the walking around up and down the aisle if you think if you think there's a problem in the church you be the one to set it right you'd be the one to take that step oh goodness listen let's read this quote now the first step is repentance toward God then follows after that there's water baptism water baptism repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see water baptism fall of showing that repentance was genuine or to remit our past sins that has nothing to do with future sin it only remits repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what for remission taken away of past sin has nothing to do with the future just your sin has been chopped off what you did you can't repair for what Adam done you never did it Adam did you just get forgiveness for what you done the old naturist excuse me I didn't mean to do that let's listen do you realize well no second here do you realize why you need to be justified and sanctified and born baptized with the Holy Ghost do you realize you realize why you need to go through those steps because you've got to get you got to clear a path for the bastards normally ghost you got to clear a path you got to clear away your old sins had to be cleared away because it's in your hair how could how can God come and live with me at all this stuff I've done you got to get that cleared away and soon you repent and all that gets washed away and then it's time to be sanctified it's time to go clean up and you begin something against the dealing with your conscience and you go for one of them do you remember that time I stole that pair of socks from you do you remember that time I did something I spoke against you are you clearing everything up because you want to be safe too far there's something in you that's driving you to be clean but something in you that's driving you to do something you wouldn't do otherwise the gold otherwise I'd say I'm sorry for what I've done I'm sorry forgive me for all the stuff I've done and you clear all that out and then there ain't no impediment you've got to get all that stuff out of the way to repent get all that stuff out of the way and then there ain't nothing to hinder the baptism that all it goes from coming on you everything's out of the way and then you can receive freely see when you've done all that when you repent when you've got all that out of the way you don't have to pray then all that's left for you to do is to go through the wedding ceremony the preacher gets up there and says will you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband and you're sitting there listen to the preacher preach there's something within your heart says I do I do take this Jesus Christ to be my lawfully wedded husband I do take him and something drops down into your soul and becomes quickened to you and it's quicken to you this become a living reality you then because you've been wet and you've gone through the process of where everything's been stripped away yeah that's how probably we don't want to go through that process but you've got to die to yourself you've got a you've got to repent and say I don't care what the world thinks let all this thing fall away and then then you're said to take a journey what kind of journey a journey of walking into identification and that's what I believe our God called ministers said to do is to identify the Church of the Living God it's to identify what God has done to identify scripturally who the bride is and that's what you're doing you're walking into identification you're walking into the into the message that you've heard you were walking into it one step at a time you know you think like like John when he came onto the scene everybody was going in the wrong direction the Pharisees thought they had the Sabbath all understood they thought they had it all understood because they think it like like we've heard brother around talked about how they could put a opinion through the scroll and tell where whatever letter that was here they understood mentally the word of that much but then John comes on the scene and what he's doing he begins to turn everybody we got to go over this way and he begins to turn them toward theirs coming to Messiah the word has begin to come and Plainview and he had to turn them that way so that they could walk that way that's what that's what the Prophet had to do we had to come this day he had to come and bring as a message to turn us to literally turn us to literally turn the hearts of the children back to the original faith to literally turn us so that we could walk that way if he had to come we woulda just walked off the world I reckon but he had to come so that we could be literally turned and walk that way and you heard the voice just like Peter did that boy said come that voice is the one that voices like John said boys the boys cried a voice of one crying in the wilderness and we've heard the voice the voice of someone from another world voice from another world that you can't see calling you to update it to be identified with him and you think look back look back to your walk of how simple it was how simple your walk is that's what I want to do now is I want to identifying you they'll walk that you've taken because God has taken you through a journey just like he took Abraham just like your seven peaks said he took brother Branham through and he looked there and he said look your name is inscribed on those mountains listen you could even go on Google Maps and search for Branham Peaks that's how much his name was inscribed on those mountains his name is even written their own Google Maps it's written on the map Branham is there you can go read it because God wrote it listen God wrote his name and those Peaks before he ever changed Abraham's name he wrote his name in those Peaks because it was sitting there and you looked back through your life and see how God wrote his name in your life as you took your journey you started off walking one step at a time one step and you began to be identified with the word like for example in Exodus where it says and thou shalt make curtains of goats hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle eleven curtains shalt thou make and over in first Corinthians that says but a woman if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering she's got that hair to cover that Tabernacle the show as a sign that she believed the message for her day and to show really what is showing is that the word has produced something in her life and you know you know many times you're we stumble over preaching clothes and clothes our clothes line religion but I want to preach tonight a clothes line religion it's not a clothes line religion because somebody forced you to do it but it's a clothes line religion because you looked into the pages of the Bible and you said I don't want to do that I want to match up with the requirement of the word I want to do that because the word says to do it and you lay it aside everything of this world like unlike soul who were the same you came on to me and said why do I hear the bleeding of the goats and the sheep why's there stuff that you still hadn't killed kill it all let it all down let everything of this world perish so that you can manifest every jot and tittle of the word that every last bit yet Jesus said I'm there on the run the River Jordan it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness everything that's written in the pages of this Bible has got to be fulfilled and you are the one that's going to fulfill it it's do you realize that you realize what that power was that that that Peter was walking on that power that he was what power do you have the power that you have is that you are the seed of God hidden in an earthen vessel you are the seed you are the two evidences hidden in the earthen vessel you are the seed of God in flesh just like Jesus as he walked the shores of Galilee just like all the ones of old they brewed and testified of this Dave when God will be revealed in your flesh tabernacle in your members and that's what that that longer hair that that a woman wears testifies off I've heard the message of the day I've heard it I've matched up my life it's matching pieces everything matches up well where am I let's say let's read let's read quote number nine everybody doing all right [Applause] the rent said in Israel in the church he said don't be deceived you could better search this clothes now see if you keep on saying well I don't don't condemn me to do this don't continue to do that things of the world now I'm going to hurt you just a little bit pull the feathers back the other way that's quote number nine brothers but it's this one sure evidence you never been to Christ you never been born here if you're still long for the things of this world if you still if you don't see God's Word being manifested in if you can't stay away for the things of the world he that loves the world or the things of the world the love of God's not even in it now if you just quit it doing it because you dog you know you ought to do it and quit doing this that's the sign that you haven't gotten nowhere yet when that thing becomes dead in you and the nature of us going away there's another person in there and it can only produce the Holy Spirit that was in Christ and you produces the christ-like life nothing you do what he did he chose that before the foundation of the world let's go to let's go to number ten I just go to number ten I read Colossians 3:12 3:16 because I want to look at what it will produce on you put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies do you think think about this do you see these things written in your life bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mine meekness long-suffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do you listen y'all well you can get to the point where you love one another so much you could have somebody spit in your face like they did Jesus if somebody slaps you across the face you still love them and I'm not talking about from a put-on love I'm not talking about where you've kind of fake patience and you think that you've got a volcano of Rage hiding underneath the surface but I'm talking about a real something real and genuine that you really love one another that's what we're coming to if any man have a quarrel guess Deana even as Christ forgave you so also do ye can you forgive your brother and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness you know with say charity is love but charity is being a Christian which is living your life for others charity is given giving of yourself ready to give everything if necessary ready to help your brother because do unto others as you would have them do unto you maybe you think about these all these scriptures that you think seems so simple but that's the Christian life that's the Christian life that that you can't put on you can try to put them feathers in you like brother I'm talked about with this weird something real then everybody will be able to know it and God will do it and the devil will know it and above all and he said and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also you are called in one body and be thankful you know what you know what the peace of God is the peace of God is not well I hope everything will be alright the peace of God is not you know listen Peter there in the midst of all the storms all of the things raging when Jesus got back to the boat peace was in the boat and the wind ceased because peace peace is the word and will you have the word then that brings peace peace to you you are the walking seed word that's what I'm gonna end here so the music's just can go ahead and come forward immediately in Matthew 14 31 32 it says immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and called him and said unto Him o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou down and when they were coming to the ship the wind ceased the wind ceased when Jesus was in the book I don't ask you tonight if Jesus is not in your boat you've heard the gospel call you've heard the gospel call for many years but maybe tonight who knows maybe tonight is the first night it really sunk into you and you realized that you were lost and that you needed a guide you needed somebody to guide you back to the boat you need somebody to get in the boat with you so I wonder if tonight if you realize you need something would you lift your hands up to God I'm lifted my hand up because I need more I need something I need God more now than ever that God sees your head listen you think that's just a psychological trick to say well lift your hands up let people won't raise their hands unless there's something motivating them to do it unless there's something whirling and pulsating telling them there's something that you're a needy people you know God made us and needy people just like Peter there in that boat God made us that way that we wouldn't need him he gave us a thirst that you would need something to quench that thirst he gave you that and there's only one thing that can quench that thirst and that's the word of God he's given the gospel call come come let's just bow our heads and go to the Lord in prayer Lord God well thank you Lord Jesus for your grace to us tonight and I believe that you're here Lord the building I believe it's your present Lord Jesus you promised that you would be a present help in time of need and in time of trouble I Peter there that boat you promised that you'd never leave us or forsake us that you go with us all the journey that you're to walk with us Lord Jesus Lord God I want to be like brother Branham in that story where he took a hold of that phone line and he never let go of that God let me be like that Lord Jesus if that's a listen and I could take the night let me never let go of that God and Lord you so all they uplifted hands tonight Lord Jesus sitting they raised their hand up to you because Lord God we know that we're needed Lord Jesus ever a hand lifted up Lord Jesus is a signal for my hearts Lord God that we need you Lord Jesus and I'm so thankful tonight Lord God to know that there is an answer for that need there's an answer for every trouble every trial Lord there's an answer for every wind and wave and you are that answer Lord Jesus and I pray God that you'll answer back Lord Jesus tonight we're not just not just a psychology or something that can be debated the Lord let us did not go from here presume and Lord Jesus but give us something Lord God that we know and I presume it anymore that we know that you're real that we know that there is a God in Israel that there is a God there is a balm in Gilead god I pray Lord that you let your every need for tonight Lord Jesus I pray O God that if there be any one Lord God the night Lord Jesus is struggling within himself Lord and thinking like I can't run up to an altar because everybody will see me Lord I pray God that you'll tear away that veil of tear away all that down and everything that's crushing them over and let them died of themselves and I Lord Jesus just give away we believe Lord God that you're still able that you're still the same God it was testified of it was written of in the Bible that these things that were spoken of the night are true and God I know lighting up convinced I'm assured I'm standing tonight that the word that's written on the this Bible it will produce in the lives of the believers if we let it God granted I pray that you will let it Lord Jesus let us die Lord God help us in the I - I see Lord Jesus Lord God I pray Lord Jesus that you Lord God be with everyone as we leave deny Lord Jesus and it won't be just a formality we've come to church but Lord God that the words that wasn't have been spooking the night Lord Jesus with ringing in our ears on the way home Lord God that it'll put a melody in our heart and a song that I step Lord Jesus then we'll go of a truth Lord Jesus at sea we will we are wearing our hearts glad when we heard them Lord Jesus Lord God I ask these things upon your people that you bless all the ministers and all the deacons and all the ones that are striving to serve you Lord Jesus and above all bless this church I pray O God that Lord will see you manifested you power and demonstration
