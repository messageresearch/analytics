[15:11] morning everyone and i' would like to
[15:13] bring you the greetings from the
[15:15] Philippines and our church there in uh
[15:18] in in Manila brother our pastor here
[15:22] brother samale and that the privilege to
[15:24] be there last 2005 and B Wade in 2015
[15:28] and so uh they they know you they they
[15:31] watching your services here once in a
[15:33] while and uh and of course uh they know
[15:36] that I'm here right now and uh we are
[15:38] thankful that the Lord has brought
[15:40] our has brought us here by his grace can
[15:43] you be SE for a while just uh uh I will
[15:47] bring greetings to from the people uh in
[15:50] the Philippines and of course you know
[15:52] most of the ministers who have been here
[15:53] before brother roel brother Danny
[15:55] brother Nestor I think brother lanlan
[15:57] also these are the pastors that have
[16:00] been here in the past and it's always
[16:02] good to see uh to know that when you go
[16:04] to a certain pulpit and uh a certain
[16:06] church and the pastor does not introduce
[16:09] you anymore that means you are at home
[16:11] right yeah because I I have been here I
[16:15] think the first time that I I I first
[16:17] went to the US was in 2002 and uh during
[16:20] that time um I think brother Samuel deas
[16:24] he hosted a Miss missions meeting here
[16:27] where brother Ed bisc was the the
[16:29] speaker and uh since it was a missionary
[16:32] meeting they invited me to come over
[16:33] that he we we don't know each other yet
[16:36] during that time and I was there to
[16:37] speak about uh what Bible Bible Way was
[16:40] doing the Philippines of all this
[16:42] translation and distribution and
[16:44] printing of books so uh that was the
[16:46] first time I uh met brother samale in
[16:49] that meetings I was not able to go to
[16:50] this church but um we we had some other
[16:53] schedules but uh I mean I met the
[16:55] brothers and and the sisters and I was
[16:59] just thankful and uh again um maybe a
[17:02] couple of years uh later or three years
[17:04] later brother Samuel um went to the
[17:07] Philippines with brother Ernie and you
[17:09] know all all of you know brother Ernie
[17:11] and uh we went around the Philippines um
[17:14] we we went to some Churches and I I I'm
[17:18] not particularly sure what the exact man
[17:20] but it was that time that Brother Sam
[17:22] started supporting the Mission Works in
[17:24] the Philippines sending uh this um funds
[17:27] for for different churches and I I would
[17:30] say that this it has accomplished a lot
[17:33] in our country in the Philippines
[17:34] helping the brothers and sisters in in
[17:37] the in the countryside but not only that
[17:39] in the past few years I have been
[17:41] engaged together with brother Nestor and
[17:43] brother Danny in the Asian missions uh
[17:46] so we we were able to reach out to the
[17:48] other countries like Cambodia Thailand
[17:51] Vietnam even to the Pakistan so and the
[17:55] brother Samu has always assisted us in
[17:58] those M me uh Mission Works so uh we
[18:03] don't know where the last is laying amen
[18:06] but uh if the Lord leads us to go into
[18:09] some place then we just do it our as the
[18:12] Lord leads and uh I I would say that uh
[18:15] your church here has been a part of
[18:16] those Mission Works so whatever is
[18:18] accomplished there I believe uh uh we
[18:22] are all part of it in prayers in uh in
[18:24] your support in the financial support
[18:26] and everything and so um I I would say
[18:29] we we we baptized uh recently in the
[18:32] last in our last few trips in Cambodia
[18:34] we have baptized about nine Souls there
[18:37] just just continue to add to the Lord it
[18:39] might not be as many as Believers in the
[18:42] Philippines amen because as you know
[18:45] Cambodia is predominantly a uh Buddhist
[18:48] country so they don't have no knowledge
[18:51] any whatsoever about the Bible but when
[18:53] you start I mean when the Lord starts
[18:55] opening their eyes then uh we we're just
[18:57] thankful with the what the Lord's doing
[19:00] and what we are doing is just a small
[19:02] part of the big move of the lord it's
[19:04] nothing not not that we are great or
[19:06] anything but we believe that uh it's
[19:08] just a privilege that uh the Lord helped
[19:10] us to be part of those it was really
[19:13] brother Nestor brother Danny who he
[19:15] spearheaded those Asian missions um way
[19:18] back in the early 2000s so uh the Lord
[19:21] is now uh yielding we can see now the
[19:23] fruits of all their labors and we thank
[19:26] you for all your prayers and so we I'm
[19:29] here the on my fifth time I believe the
[19:31] last time I was here was the 40th
[19:33] anniversary or I don't know what how
[19:35] many years but that was the 4th of July
[19:38] uh 2015 and I remember I was in the
[19:41] immigra in the immigration there and the
[19:43] the immigration officer just put me on
[19:46] hold and he said so why are you here and
[19:48] I said I'm a pastor so again he asked a
[19:51] question so why are you here I said I
[19:53] was invited to to preach for for a
[19:56] church here in their Church anniversary
[19:57] and of course I have the documents and
[19:59] all the invitation but you know sometime
[20:01] in the immigration they they try to test
[20:03] you and so he said if you're a pastor
[20:05] what what will you you what what are you
[20:07] preaching on Sunday and I said since
[20:09] it's the 4th of July then I'll be
[20:11] preaching on the book of Exodus it's
[20:14] about Liberation anyway so and so he
[20:16] didn't ask any more
[20:18] question and so sometimes you have to
[20:21] just go around them you know and uh uh
[20:24] but I'm thankful that uh this my fifth
[20:26] time and uh being the fifth time is you
[20:28] know number five is the number of Grace
[20:30] and by God's grace I have my wife here
[20:32] with me Irene
[20:35] amen this is our first time to be in the
[20:38] US uh we just came from Brother Ed bcal
[20:41] Church a week ago and uh I was telling
[20:44] when we were younger I cannot bring her
[20:46] to me when we we when I fly because uh
[20:49] our children were still small during
[20:51] that time but now they're all graduate
[20:53] uh from they have graduated from school
[20:55] one is already married four already
[20:57] adults and they all uh have their own
[21:00] work so I guess I told my wife uh you
[21:03] can come with me don't wait until we 75
[21:06] years old can we cannot walk anymore
[21:09] that much so at least she will
[21:12] experience what she was seeing in the
[21:14] pictures when I was going here and going
[21:16] there and uh I I always uh prayed to the
[21:19] Lord that one day I'll bring her here
[21:21] because the family of brother samale as
[21:24] I I told before they're like family to
[21:26] me I mean um brother Wade and brother
[21:30] Terrence and their family sister Anna I
[21:32] was I was I was surprised to see their
[21:34] children I mean like Abigail for example
[21:36] when I was when I was here in 2007 she
[21:39] was just a little baby and now she's
[21:40] grown up and you know when when when you
[21:42] see somebody that are growing up and
[21:44] still continuing to in the Lord uh that
[21:46] makes you uh really joyful you know that
[21:49] uh and I I believe any Minister would
[21:51] like to see people you know being in the
[21:53] Lord for many years and seeing them
[21:55] again they growing up some of them
[21:57] getting married already but I still
[21:59] remember many faces amen uh the The
[22:02] Familiar Faces here I may not remember
[22:04] all the names but I mean I I remember
[22:06] all all the faces and uh again I'm very
[22:10] uh at home when I go to this church and
[22:13] sometimes I don't want to over
[22:14] familiarize myself but that's the way it
[22:16] say I mean they brother W is like a
[22:19] brother to me and I mean um they have
[22:22] ministered to the Philippines the PE the
[22:24] people that love them and um uh I'm just
[22:26] thankful that I'm here right now and of
[22:28] course brother John sister Alicia has he
[22:31] has been telling they're part of our
[22:33] church family in in in in the
[22:36] Philippines he has been there 2015 and
[22:39] uh I don't know if he have told you but
[22:40] when he went there he went there the
[22:42] first time by my by himself and the the
[22:45] company checked him in in the hotel in
[22:47] the shanga hotel and he was looking for
[22:50] for a church and he he found that there
[22:52] was a church just below the
[22:54] rooming and that was the first time I we
[22:57] actually it was not the first time I
[22:58] believe
[22:58] seeing him way in way back in the years
[23:01] when he was still in the Church of
[23:03] brother Earl Heist but we didn't have
[23:05] chance to talk but since then uh when we
[23:08] when he brought his family to the
[23:09] Philippines in the ending uh the last
[23:12] quarter of 2015 and every year
[23:14] thereafter he stayed there uh uh he
[23:17] stayed there for months and uh brother
[23:21] Samuel was saying he was surprised
[23:22] because I told him that brother brother
[23:24] John is preaching in our church and not
[23:27] only in our church he preaches in church
[23:29] of brother Danny brother Nestor and in
[23:32] the international Youth
[23:34] Camp yeah so I said maybe he's a secret
[23:37] preacher here secret agent Preacher
[23:40] Brother amen so but we were blessed in
[23:43] the the ministry of Brother John and um
[23:46] this family of course is uh I used to
[23:48] call his son Little John amen melmel and
[23:52] uh Anna so we're just we just we're just
[23:55] happy you know that uh they've been
[23:57] there so uh in in in our in our country
[23:59] I preach half English half Tagalog okay
[24:03] of course when I read the quote it's in
[24:04] English I explain it in Tagalog so he my
[24:09] my son that just do the translation for
[24:11] them so hoping that uh one day they will
[24:14] learn the whole language nobody needs to
[24:17] translate anymore amen so we heard this
[24:20] testimony and many young people were
[24:22] blessed by his testimony and uh when I
[24:26] heard that uh he was going back to
[24:28] Atlanta because of the work I said you
[24:31] know uh they know this church of course
[24:33] and uh and uh I I said I'll I'll be
[24:36] happy if you'll be in in in the Church
[24:38] of Samuel Deale because if I go there I
[24:41] can see
[24:42] you and uh uh everything I said I mean
[24:46] the prophet said God is behind every
[24:48] move every move so there's no accident
[24:51] no I believe that everything that
[24:53] happens is for a reason for a purpose
[24:55] and so now the Lord just uh uh Place us
[24:58] together and of course brother Louise
[25:01] Sister Christine yeah they have been in

[25:17] sister chrisen was still there so anyway
[25:20] um this is I said I'm very familiar with
[25:24] you and you're familiar with me so I
[25:26] just want to just to speak out what is
[25:28] in my heart nothing nothing doctrinal
[25:31] because you have good teachers here you
[25:33] see when brother Wade was there I was
[25:35] telling yes this a teaching gift he can
[25:37] you know many people were blessed in the
[25:39] way he he he he laid down the word so uh
[25:43] we are thankful for that gift
[25:45] amen we went to the mountains we went to
[25:48] the coastal areas we went to the
[25:50] churches Church anniversaries and
[25:51] wherever he goes I mean the gift just
[25:54] manifest itself and uh it's a blessing
[25:57] to the people many of
[25:58] the things that he taught I still have
[26:00] in my notes so sometimes you have to
[26:02] expound it and I believe every five-fold
[26:05] Ministry has his own gift and uh I I I
[26:08] want I like what the prophet said that
[26:10] uh you have to be what God chose you to
[26:12] be that's right if you just try to
[26:14] imitate others or just a mimic and you
[26:16] will not be a success so that is the way
[26:19] God chose him to be so he's being a
[26:21] blessing and this the way that God chose
[26:23] me to be so I hope that uh we'll be
[26:26] blessed by the word of the Lord amen can
[26:28] now can we now please stand and uh I'll
[26:31] just read a couple of uh um scriptures
[26:34] as our opening text let's all bow our
[26:37] heads and let's uh pray to the
[26:40] Lord our gracious Heavenly Father we are
[26:43] so thankful Lord for this great
[26:45] privilege this great opportunity Lord
[26:47] that you have given us to be with the
[26:49] Saints here in Lula Georgia Lord
[26:52] believing Lord that there's there's
[26:54] something in it for us today we may be
[26:57] here for some other reason Lord but we
[26:59] believe Lord that you have a portion for
[27:02] each one of us the old ones the The
[27:04] Young Ones the middle age Lord you can
[27:06] speak to our hearts directly Lord by
[27:08] Your Word by the preaching of the word
[27:10] so I pray that you give us the action
[27:12] Lord give us give me the anointing as I
[27:15] speak your word give the anointing Lord
[27:17] to the hearts and the ears of my
[27:19] brothers and sisters that there will
[27:21] that there will be a a a a free flow of
[27:23] the spirit Lord Lord and you may have
[27:26] preeminence in our midst at the end of
[27:28] this uh message Lord we we pray that you
[27:32] you get all the glory and the honors for
[27:34] this is our prayer in the name of our
[27:36] Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen praise
[27:39] the Lord amen for so for this morning
[27:42] I'd like to I have a little subject that
[27:45] I would like to speak on just speak out
[27:47] of my heart Brokenness in spirit
[27:50] Brokenness in spirit and this where I
[27:52] got uh this subject from the book of
[27:55] Psalm 51 verse uh we'll be reading let's
[28:00] read the couple of verse 16 and 17 he
[28:02] says for thou desireth not sacrifice
[28:05] else would I give it thou Delights in
[28:08] the not in the burnt offering verse 17
[28:11] the sacrifices of God are a broken
[28:14] Spirit a broken and a contrite heart oh
[28:17] God thou will not despise amen amen and
[28:21] in the book of Galatians in the New
[28:25] Testament this uh Paul now now speaking
[28:29] uh exhorting the Galatians to Bear one
[28:31] another's burden that if anyone would
[28:33] backslide he encouraged them to restore
[28:36] such one in the spirit of meekness you
[28:38] know to consider thyself that any one of
[28:40] us can be tempted as well so in verse
[28:43] three chapter 6:3 said for if a man
[28:47] think himself to be something when he is
[28:50] nothing ex then he deceive it himself
[28:53] amen amen God bless his word uh we may
[28:56] now be seated
[28:59] amen so in the book of Jeremiah it says
[29:02] there that the heart is deceitful in all
[29:04] things now you can deceive yourself of
[29:06] believing that you are somebody right
[29:09] and people today I mean the general
[29:12] public the general
[29:14] population uh they always think that
[29:17] because they were able to study in
[29:19] college you know reach certain position
[29:23] acquire so many possessions in their
[29:25] life they they could think that they are
[29:27] somebody when you you when you apply for
[29:29] a job for example you have to to to give
[29:33] uh all your credentials in your resume
[29:35] put everything all the training that you
[29:37] have undergone because you have to prove
[29:39] to them that you are somebody right and
[29:42] uh I believe back in the 1970s there was
[29:45] this popular song popularized and it
[29:48] goes to say like uh Learning To Love
[29:50] Yourself is The Greatest Love of All it
[29:53] is as if that we lack loving ourself but
[29:57] you know we are living in the days and
[29:58] the times uh the in in this time of the
[30:02] uh that U people in the book of Timothy
[30:05] says people will be lovers of their own
[30:07] selves there's there's no scarcity of
[30:10] loving oneself every people love his or
[30:14] herself right that's why he feeds
[30:16] himself he he sometimes he even Abus
[30:20] himself for so many things because he
[30:22] loves himself too much right and the
[30:25] Bible is uh I mean that psychology will
[30:27] tell us oh
[30:28] you can love everybody but also don't
[30:31] forget to take care of yourself to love
[30:33] yourself but that's psychology know but
[30:36] uh in the Scriptures it says there that
[30:37] we should deny ourselves we should love
[30:40] God above all we should love our
[30:42] neighbors as ourselves so it's already a
[30:46] given right that people do you don't
[30:48] have to teach to let them to go to
[30:50] school to to teach them to love
[30:52] themselves people are always loving
[30:54] themselves right that's why when a when
[30:56] a baby is born when a baby is born you
[30:59] will notice that all their fist are
[31:00] clenched like this because they want
[31:02] everything for themselves right but when
[31:05] a person dies he opens his hand you
[31:08] cannot see a dead man with a clench fist
[31:12] unless he died so angry yeah right but
[31:15] if he's a normal man that he dies he
[31:17] just open his hands he said I'm nothing
[31:21] right he gives everything because he
[31:22] knows that he cannot bring anything that
[31:24] he has uh taken here in this life but
[31:26] only his character right right amen and
[31:29] so uh having this in mind we we we see
[31:32] that uh people wants to put up
[31:35] themselves right people people would
[31:38] think that they are highly uh better or
[31:41] should say better than other people not
[31:44] only in I mean we can look at politics
[31:47] how they fight one another uh how they
[31:49] they wanted to be the best right you go
[31:52] to the corporate side they do it go to
[31:54] the to the sports everybody wants to be
[31:57] the champion nobody wants to be the
[31:58] loser everybody will train hard all the
[32:01] rest of his life just you know just to
[32:03] be Champion for maybe a period of time
[32:06] and then the people will start
[32:07] forgetting them when you go to the
[32:09] ministry it's almost the same
[32:11] thing uh uh you go around so many
[32:14] countries and you see people because of
[32:17] course the five the the the prophet said
[32:19] there will be uh three kinds of
[32:20] Believers there will be people who are
[32:22] standing as ministers as missionaries
[32:24] and everything but all they want to do
[32:26] is to you know uh get
[32:28] recognition for themselves you see and
[32:31] that's very true that's that's very hard
[32:33] to to to say but it's the truth amen see
[32:36] uh some not not every people not every
[32:39] part of the fivefold ministry are really
[32:41] part of the fivefold ministry some they
[32:44] have their own personal agenda you see
[32:46] but we we don't condemn them we we just
[32:48] look at ourselves so I want to look at
[32:51] myself this morning uh where am I am at
[32:54] okay I don't want to continue serving
[32:56] the lord without without knowing the the
[33:00] motives and objectives of my heart I I
[33:02] believe uh uh it's brother Bram always
[33:06] uh tells us that uh we need to check uh
[33:09] if our motives and objectives are right
[33:11] sometime in 1964 the message is Shalom
[33:15] and it was it was a j January of the
[33:17] 1964 I believe and um he he was doing
[33:22] his introduction and he said uh in his
[33:24] prayer he said Lord help me to make my
[33:27] motiv and objective right amen he was
[33:30] telling that now this is 1964 January
[33:34] and about two years later he going to
[33:36] live the sin is you would think that
[33:38] this is a prophet of God and he could
[33:40] have been almost perfect two years
[33:43] before he died but he was humble enough
[33:46] to say Lord I want to check uh my
[33:49] motives and objectives I want to know if
[33:51] it is right in your eyes am see this is
[33:54] the prophet that we believe in and he he
[33:56] has the humility to admit that he might
[33:58] have a wrong objective of something he
[34:01] might have a wrong motive of something
[34:03] and you see now it it's it's it's
[34:05] amazing to know that many ministers
[34:07] today would would think that they all
[34:10] have the right motives and objectives
[34:12] but the prophet we believe in amen right
[34:15] he's so humble amen that even the last
[34:18] two years of his life he was still
[34:20] praying Lord make my motive and
[34:22] objective right in your eyes amen I
[34:25] think that's a lesson to us to to to
[34:27] think that uh every start of the year
[34:29] like this month of January it is always
[34:32] good to check ourselves and Lord do I
[34:34] have the right motive right the right
[34:37] objective in the things that I'm doing
[34:39] before we go forward into what we want
[34:42] to do for this year
[34:44] 2019 okay
[34:46] so being this uh uh I mean if we don't
[34:51] have a broken Spirit no God will allow
[34:56] things to happen in our life that we may
[34:58] experience some things maybe it's too
[35:00] hard for us but it will break our spirit
[35:03] and will make it make us right in the
[35:05] eyes of God sometime so but uh no if you
[35:10] if if at the start we already have this
[35:12] humility that we need you see um then
[35:15] sometimes you don't have to go through
[35:17] those things but I believe that every
[35:18] son and daughter of God will have to
[35:20] experience those things it's it's part
[35:22] of our training it's it's part of our
[35:25] molding the the character that needs to
[35:27] be molded in our in our hearts because
[35:30] if a person is not broken in his Spirit
[35:34] he will have the tendency it's it's
[35:35] human nature it's it's almost a human
[35:37] tendency that you you feel Superior to
[35:40] some other people right whether what
[35:44] whatever country you belong to whether
[35:45] you you you go here or you go there it's
[35:48] you always there's always a human
[35:50] tendency if you are not a Believer but
[35:52] you want to be superior over somebody
[35:55] okay once you get a hold of some
[35:57] position
[35:58] or maybe you you were recognized by by
[36:01] some group then there's always a
[36:04] tendency to be lifted up in Pride right
[36:06] I remember uh King Uzziah being blessed
[36:09] by by the Lord not because he was good
[36:11] but because he was obeying the Lord and
[36:14] you so see I I I always tell to my
[36:16] church salvation is
[36:18] unconditional we were saved by grace of
[36:20] God not not by our works but the
[36:22] blessings of the Lord this is
[36:24] conditional if we obey the Lord then
[36:26] blessings comes and if we disobey the
[36:29] Lord then curse comes in our life and
[36:32] you reap all the consequence of our
[36:34] wrong action uh when when we have a a
[36:38] youth Fellowship in our church I always
[36:39] tell my youth don't don't you know if
[36:42] you can avoid doing mistakes in your
[36:44] life if you have given the freedom of
[36:47] choice just choose always the right way
[36:50] because every time you choose the wrong
[36:51] way there's always consequence of Your
[36:54] Action and I was telling them as I
[36:56] testify I have made bad decisions in my
[36:59] teenage years in my early 20s that I
[37:02] suffered the consequence 20 years later
[37:05] amen you know this consequence will run
[37:07] after you and sometimes if we are honest
[37:10] enough in ourselves the reason why we
[37:12] are in this position because of the
[37:14] wrong things that we have done in the
[37:15] past right and and why does the Lord
[37:18] allows this consequence because so we
[37:20] can so we will start hating the sin that
[37:22] we have done in the past and we will not
[37:24] go back to that anymore and when you
[37:26] when you talk to the young generation
[37:28] you're talking out of experience it's
[37:31] not theology anymore but it is all
[37:34] knowledge I mean it's not wisdom right
[37:37] because you yourself have have
[37:38] experienced it so you not talking about
[37:41] another man's story but it is your own
[37:43] story right so when we when when we are
[37:48] obedient to the Lord we are blessed but
[37:50] sometimes if we are we are not able to
[37:52] handle it the right way we will look at
[37:54] others who cannot follow the message and
[37:57] little lower scale right and sometimes
[38:00] you force it I was telling in our
[38:02] parents we have a what I call the
[38:04] parents Fellowship where we gather all
[38:06] the parents and teach them about uh how
[38:09] to be a good parent not according again
[38:11] to psychology but according to what the
[38:13] message tells us and so I I'm telling
[38:15] you sometimes we many of them they drive
[38:18] their their children out of their house
[38:20] because they try to implement the you
[38:22] know like a tradition or what the
[38:25] message according to their opinion right
[38:27] and so instead of uh blessing their
[38:30] children they they drive them away
[38:33] because they think they're so righteous
[38:36] see they are so righteous that they
[38:38] don't make mistakes anymore but then the
[38:41] Lord will send a condition a situation
[38:44] or any circumstance that will break our
[38:47] spirit then at the end we will realize
[38:49] we are nothing see there this in John
[38:52] chapter 15 you can read that there that
[38:55] apart apart from the Lord if we he's the
[38:57] vine we are the branches if we abide in
[39:00] him we can bear much fruit and uh apart
[39:02] from him we cannot do anything right we
[39:05] cannot do anything but the opposite
[39:07] verse in Philippians chapter 4:3 said
[39:10] with I can do all things through
[39:12] Christen who strengthens me what how can
[39:14] Paul said say that because he had an
[39:17] experience his Spirit was broken right
[39:20] and maybe later little bit later we'll
[39:22] look at this some of the characters of
[39:23] The Bible which I know you are all
[39:25] familiar but just to emphasize a thought
[39:28] uh this morning that uh uh the Lord
[39:30] sometimes need to to break our spirit
[39:33] you so we can have compassion to
[39:36] understand other people right right
[39:38] right when I was a young uh Minister I
[39:40] was not even a pastor I when I preach in
[39:42] the Pulpit you know you you know when
[39:44] you're a young Minister brother W you
[39:46] just you just do this it's either you do
[39:48] it or you go to hell that that's that's
[39:51] no Grace at all no Grace at all and I
[39:53] and I go around I I preach so hard and
[39:56] then and the people instead of being
[39:58] blessed they they they just get
[40:00] condemnation right and then you know as
[40:03] you grow older the Lord gives you Grace
[40:04] and he he tells you that uh you're
[40:07] you're you're not as good as anybody
[40:08] you're you're not better than them we
[40:11] I'm only a it just fell on my LA to
[40:13] preach but I'm no better than the people
[40:15] I preach to okay and God will allow you
[40:18] know uh some Sometimes some things in
[40:20] our church in our own family like like
[40:24] sometimes your children would backl then
[40:26] you will realize that it's not because
[40:28] you're a believer that your children
[40:29] will be true believers right see and God
[40:33] allows these things he doesn't want you
[40:34] to have a broken family but sometimes
[40:36] God allows these things so you can know
[40:39] that we are just dependent on the Lord
[40:42] amen amen see you will stop demanding
[40:46] from others because if you are nobody
[40:49] you cannot go out and demand and the
[40:51] reason why you are demanding from
[40:53] somebody because you think you are
[40:54] somebody when in fact we are nobody
[40:57] right
[40:57] so here we realize uh like I just like
[41:03] to to read this particular verse in uh
[41:05] Luke chapter 16 now just just just to to
[41:09] tell you how how the Lord sees people
[41:13] who who who thinks so high of themselves
[41:17] see in Luke chapter 16 he said he was
[41:20] talking to the to the to the Pharisees
[41:23] he said and he said unto them ye are
[41:26] they which just Jus ify yourselves
[41:28] before men but God knows your heart for
[41:32] that which is highly esteemed among men
[41:35] is abomination in the sight of God if
[41:37] you esteem so highly for yourself among
[41:40] men I mean it's like in Modern English
[41:43] you will say I'm better than you than
[41:44] others and for for God that is an
[41:47] Abomination and if you look at the word
[41:50] Abomination it's it's it's it's it looks
[41:53] like a not not so hard word right but
[41:56] it's an abomination then so there I I
[41:58] heard from an old preacher before how
[42:01] describes abomination in in in the
[42:04] modern days it's like he said um uh in
[42:08] the times of the The Exodus the the
[42:12] Israelites will go out to the Wilderness
[42:15] you know they don't have toilets during
[42:16] that time they will they get their
[42:18] Spades and dig a hole and do their
[42:20] toilet jutties there and then they have
[42:22] to cover it because if they will not
[42:24] cover it it will be an abomination right
[42:27] so in modern translate that to modern
[42:29] language it is an an flash toilet that
[42:32] is an Abomination see un flash toilet
[42:35] right so if we think of ourselves High
[42:38] higher than the others we are like un
[42:40] flash toilets in the sight of the Lord
[42:43] that's how he describes it right it's an
[42:45] abomination in the sight of the Lord in
[42:48] in other words whatever we do our
[42:50] righteousness it's just like rubbish in
[42:52] the eyes of the Lord of course we
[42:54] accomplish something by the grace of God
[42:56] and God is honored then God will give us
[42:59] a reward God is a rewarding God right
[43:01] but we cannot boast of what we want uh
[43:04] we can we can uh uh do in the sight of
[43:09] God I have a couple of uh uh quotations
[43:11] here if we can put it on the board
[43:15] uh this is from the message gyus a
[43:18] secret believer 1955 it's about being
[43:21] self
[43:22] centered
[43:24] uh it says here I I have taught much
[43:28] this brother BR I'm speaking now I have
[43:30] he is going on missionary trips he said
[43:32] he have taught the hens in Africa in
[43:35] India in many different parts of the
[43:37] world but the worst unbelievers you deal
[43:40] with is not the man who has never heard
[43:43] right you would think that the worst
[43:45] sinner would be the man that you know
[43:47] the unbelievers but they said it's the
[43:50] man who is self centered in his own way
[43:53] and won't hid to God that's the worst
[43:56] sinner because if you're are so
[43:58] self-centered a person is so
[44:00] self-centered see you will not hi
[44:03] correction right you will not need
[44:05] nobody to teach you he said that's the
[44:07] worst kind to deal with for they seem to
[44:09] be just so centered that nothing can
[44:12] move them don't talk to me I don't
[44:14] believe it right so that that's a worst
[44:17] kind of person if you are self-centered
[44:19] in another message he was talking about
[44:21] King Uzziah in the message influence
[44:23] preached in 1962 he said uh they got
[44:26] lifted up self-willed self-centered
[44:29] Pride that you can't tell nothing to God
[44:32] can uh uh God can't find a way to get
[44:35] into their hearts it's because they
[44:37] become so know it all you know it's it's
[44:40] hard to talk to a person that he knows
[44:41] everything yeah he just wants to talk
[44:45] and if you talk he doesn't care he
[44:47] doesn't want to listen and I have and
[44:49] I've met many people you know that uh
[44:51] when you start talking to them they will
[44:53] not listen and they just want to talk
[44:55] and talk and talk and you listen and
[44:56] listen listen see he's not interested in
[44:59] what you have to say he's interested in
[45:01] what he has or she has to say see these
[45:04] are self centered people and and and and
[45:08] the and the prophet said that this is
[45:10] not a nice attitude for a person right
[45:13] because I I don't know about you but uh
[45:16] you want to be with people that you know
[45:19] you can you can talk and you can listen
[45:21] to them also that's good Fellowship
[45:23] because if only one is talking then
[45:25] that's not Fellowship
[45:27] that's just like listening to a a news
[45:30] reporter recording right so we want we
[45:33] want discussion we want Fellowship we
[45:36] want to talk to one another right exort
[45:39] one another and so um if you a person
[45:42] who is self- centered he he Al he always
[45:44] wants to talk about himself right now
[45:48] the Lord allowed I said events in the
[45:50] life of the people before actually he
[45:52] uses you he wants to to to do something
[45:55] in your in your in your life life and
[45:57] when when we come to to this kind of a
[46:00] subject the first first people in the in
[46:03] the Bible that comes to our mind is like
[46:04] Moses job Peter and Paul and these
[46:09] people before God have used them
[46:10] mightily God has to break their Spirit
[46:14] see we know we all know that Moses he he
[46:16] was he was predestined to be the
[46:18] deliverer of Egypt oh I mean of of of
[46:21] the Israelites in the land of Egypt and
[46:24] I I believe that when he was growing up
[46:26] her mother joshed was already rehearsing
[46:28] to him that you were like this this is
[46:30] your testimony this is how the Lord
[46:32] protected you and so while Moses was
[46:34] learning from the from the great
[46:37] educational system of the Egyptians and
[46:39] the the prophet said he was he was
[46:42] trained in the great military uh
[46:44] traditions of Egypt but in the midst of
[46:47] all those training and exposure here is
[46:50] a little Nanny but actually her his
[46:53] mother telling him that you have a
[46:55] purpose you a reason now while he was
[46:59] growing up until he reached the age of
[47:00] 40 and I believe that uh maybe it has
[47:04] gone into the head of Moses and said oh
[47:06] I'm the deliver I'm the great man Moses
[47:08] that that the Lord will use to deliver
[47:10] his people and the prophet said well
[47:12] while the Pharaoh was looking at the
[47:14] window he saw a bunch of slaves but
[47:15] Moses had the vision he saw a bunch of
[47:18] not the slaves but these are children of
[47:20] God that needs to be delivered so he had
[47:22] the right Vision he had the right
[47:24] exposure he the right training God that
[47:26] V deicated his life but you know he's
[47:29] still the man
[47:31] Moses and sometimes if you you know so
[47:34] many things uh it become it gets into
[47:38] your head and you you just realize when
[47:40] you face the mirror your head is getting
[47:42] bigger and bigger every day right yeah
[47:45] yeah sometimes you can but people
[47:48] doesn't notice they they will notice
[47:50] their their stomach getting big right
[47:52] but you will not notice your head
[47:53] getting big because it's a little bit
[47:56] spiritual you know so but by the way you
[47:59] talk the way you you move the way you
[48:01] see people the way you see people that
[48:04] will speak what is in your heart right
[48:07] and so here is Moses one day he just uh
[48:11] uh killed an Egyptian right because he
[48:14] maybe he said I I'll put everything I
[48:15] will start my Ministry now all right I
[48:18] will start what God has called me to do
[48:21] but you know he got afraid why because
[48:23] the anointing was not there he was
[48:25] trained but the anointing was not there
[48:27] and fast forward 40 years later we know
[48:29] what happened he was brought into the
[48:32] Wilderness under his father-in law the
[48:35] medanite Jetro you know God needed 40
[48:40] years uh for Moses to be under the
[48:43] supervision is of father-in-law right so
[48:46] it can be broken and I was amazed
[48:48] brother W you know because in the
[48:50] Philippines some of the some of the
[48:51] people there will be with their
[48:52] mother-in-law or father-in-law for one
[48:54] year and they'll be totally broken just
[48:56] one
[48:57] yeah but Moses need to be with his
[48:59] father-in-law for 40 years amen see to
[49:03] to strip away everything that he learned
[49:05] not actually strip away because the
[49:06] leadership principles that he he he
[49:08] learned he used it but this time God is
[49:11] now you know directing his ways right
[49:14] amen sometimes your profession that the
[49:17] Lord has called you to be he will use it
[49:20] in the ministry that he will give you I
[49:22] have this kind of background in my own
[49:24] life and uh um I I didn't go too far
[49:29] from it I mean what the Lord has allowed
[49:31] me to be in my younger years God is
[49:34] using it in my ministry right right uh I
[49:38] I I was trained in the Philippines to be
[49:40] in uh to be in the Philippine Army in
[49:43] the ranger to be in this in this
[49:45] Guerilla Warfare to be in the mountains
[49:47] in the jungles but I never became uh I
[49:50] mean I left the military at a very young
[49:53] age so everything I learned I was not
[49:55] able to use it but many years later I
[49:57] went to the mission field the jungles
[50:00] the mountains not not not carrying a gun
[50:03] you or a comp a combat backpack but a
[50:06] Bible but you know the training is the
[50:08] same right but they they told me how you
[50:11] know how you adopt in different cultures
[50:13] when you go to a a certain location you
[50:15] have to to know their culture you know
[50:17] to to adapt yourself and all those
[50:20] principles were used not in the
[50:21] battlefield but in the mission field so
[50:24] I said nothing nothing was wasted right
[50:27] our experiences in the past our training
[50:30] in the past how the Lord used us uh I
[50:33] mean when the Lord uses us it will be
[50:35] all be used right like for example if
[50:37] you're a teacher in a school God will
[50:39] use that gift of teaching maybe in the
[50:42] church in a Sunday School in as a
[50:44] Ministry all these things God will use
[50:46] it because he knows where the the
[50:49] position that you need to be at a
[50:50] certain time at a certain point in your
[50:53] life so God allows this but he needs to
[50:55] break like Moses he broke Moses right
[50:58] that's why if we read in the book of
[51:00] Exodus chapter 3 when he was already
[51:03] being called by the Lord uh uh just just
[51:06] a portion of this word he said in in
[51:09] chapter 3 verse 10 he said come now
[51:12] therefore I will send thee unto Pharaoh
[51:14] that thou may bring forth my people the
[51:16] children of Israel out of Egypt and Mos
[51:19] said unto them God who am I that I
[51:22] should go now this is a broken Moses 40
[51:25] years later he was say oh Lord I can do
[51:27] it with my close eyes yeah uh uh but but
[51:32] now but now here is Moses he said who am
[51:34] I how can I do this is 40 years later is
[51:38] already a nobody yeah he was already
[51:41] broken right but the Lord said now I can
[51:44] use you now I can use you before I
[51:47] cannot use you but now I can use you I
[51:50] became a Believer when I was 30 years
[51:52] old I started preaching when I was 33
[51:54] years old but in the first 3 years of uh
[51:57] being a Believer God break me in so many
[52:00] ways that I didn't know why the reason I
[52:03] cannot explain but looking back I said I
[52:06] needed all those experience otherwise I
[52:09] will not be able to fulfill the ministry
[52:12] that he has usted me you know at the end
[52:14] of the at the end of the day when I
[52:16] finish my Tour of Duty I'll just
[52:19] stop I I don't believe that any ministry
[52:22] will be will going up and going up you
[52:25] know and be you will become popular
[52:28] until the Lord comes because the Bible
[52:30] said he must increase and we must
[52:33] decrease if in my Ministry I will
[52:36] decrease and be become recognized by so
[52:38] many people then I fail because I I fail
[52:41] to increase Jesus Christ and increase in
[52:43] said I increaseed myself so we must
[52:45] decrease so if they will say oh you
[52:48] you're not the they don't know you
[52:49] anymore it doesn't matter right you know
[52:53] there was in in sometime uh in the 1950s
[52:57] I believe brother Bram was was spoking
[53:01] is speaking about the present stage of
[53:02] his ministry and he mentioned about deas
[53:06] deas with Paul Paul said deas has
[53:10] forsaken has has forsaken me and it's
[53:13] for me it's so um uh you would say that
[53:17] it is Supernatural that uh Paul as a
[53:21] deas brother bam as a deas shakarian in
[53:23] his stage also and they both do they did
[53:26] both the same thing they they they
[53:27] forsaken the prophet you know and so
[53:29] here's Deus he said you know Deus
[53:32] forsook Paul but de but brother bam said
[53:35] I don't believe that deas went off to
[53:37] nightclub's box lead no he didn't do
[53:40] that he said he he was a he was a he a
[53:43] fine cultured man the prophet said he
[53:45] was smart he was intellectual he was a
[53:48] Spirit-filled man the prophet said but
[53:50] then when he saw that there's see
[53:52] seemingly a falling in the ministry of
[53:55] Paul because he was in prison this great
[53:59] uh Apostle Paul that can strike you
[54:01] blind he said now he's in the prison and
[54:04] he has only one coat and he said oh
[54:06] bring bring tell Timothy to bring my one
[54:09] coat and bring my old you know my dog my
[54:12] my my Scrolls and everything he doesn't
[54:14] have anything in himself so here is here
[54:17] is De here is here is deas he said oh
[54:20] maybe Paul is his ministry is over yeah
[54:23] see
[54:24] because the the the mindset of deas
[54:28] about the ministry you will just get
[54:30] popular and popular and Higher and
[54:31] Higher and Higher see and if you have
[54:34] that kind of thinking then once the
[54:37] ministry starts to L lay La see you will
[54:42] say Oh Brother Sam is finished no it's
[54:45] not finished because after we have done
[54:47] what we need to do I believe the Lord
[54:49] will increase and we have to decrease
[54:52] people will not have to talk about us
[54:54] anymore see if I go to for example and
[54:57] they will be talking about me then I
[54:59] failed but if they will be talking about
[55:01] the message that I preach then I have
[55:03] succeeded see as I was telling them one
[55:06] day you will forget me you will forget
[55:09] these people that the Lord has used
[55:10] maybe you will still respect them but
[55:12] you know new ministry will come up if
[55:15] the Lord will T right and this new
[55:17] ministry will come up the young
[55:19] ministers anointed preachers see it's
[55:22] not a competition anyways see we just
[55:25] want to do what we want to do amen see
[55:27] and that's the way it has to go I mean
[55:30] God has to has to break us so when he
[55:31] uses us all the glory goes to God now we
[55:35] we we see in the Book of Job if we if we
[55:38] if we open in the in the Book of Job in
[55:40] the first chapter this is the the the
[55:43] testimony or or or the statement to hear
[55:46] about job he said there was a man in the
[55:47] land of who whose name was job and that
[55:50] man was perfect and upright and one that
[55:52] feared God and stood evil and they were
[55:55] born unto him seven sons and three
[55:57] daughters good family right his
[55:59] substance also was 7,000 sheep uh 3,000
[56:03] camels 500 yoke of oxen 500 and all all
[56:06] this this this uh the belongings that he
[56:09] has and he said he was the greatest of
[56:11] all men of the East y nothing said about
[56:14] being humble no see but he was perfect
[56:17] and upright he stood evil he was great
[56:20] in the eyes of men see but the Lord
[56:23] needs to break job this is an example
[56:26] for all of us so in the next few
[56:28] chapters God was breaking job all right
[56:32] in fact it came to a point that job was
[56:33] already questioning right the Lord Lord
[56:37] I did not do something bad why is this
[56:38] happening to me and they have best
[56:40] friends that instead of encouraging him
[56:43] maybe you're a secret sinner see you
[56:45] know see when we do something when we do
[56:48] something and the people they when when
[56:51] you are in your high people you they
[56:53] they they praise you but when you are in
[56:54] your low people say oh maybe you've done
[56:56] something wrong right it's always that
[56:59] way even even coming from uh Believers
[57:03] themselves right that's why he in in one
[57:05] of the messages said the uh the prophet
[57:09] said look at job a perfect man a just
[57:11] man and God permitted the evil devil to
[57:15] come upon him and chastise him and
[57:16] everything else for the perfecting of
[57:20] his spirit amen God want I mean here in
[57:24] the vers that we read you already he was
[57:26] already perfect he was upright he's
[57:28] stood evil but but but the Lord said he
[57:31] he but but the prophet said he allowed
[57:33] everything else to happen to perfect his
[57:35] spirit amen you know the Lord is still
[57:38] in the in the business of perfecting all
[57:40] of us amen amen until it's it's not
[57:44] finished until it's finished see until
[57:46] we hit the the the Rock Bottom then
[57:48] that's the only time that we can be
[57:50] perfected in in our spirit and so God
[57:53] uses evil spirit many times to work out
[57:55] his plan and his will so of course we
[57:59] know that the evil spirit cannot cannot
[58:01] do anything in our life unless God
[58:03] allows him he's just he's just a tool in
[58:06] God's hand it's not even it's not even
[58:09] somebody that we we we should be afraid
[58:10] of you know and now uh 40 or 39 chapters
[58:15] later now this is the the the confession
[58:18] of job now after all the things that
[58:21] happen in his life he said in chapter 40
[58:24] said moreover the Lord answered job and
[58:26] and said shall he that contend with the
[58:28] almighty instruct him he that reproveth
[58:30] God let him answer then job answered the
[58:32] Lord and said behold I am vile now the
[58:36] word vile means
[58:38] insignificant he would not have told
[58:40] that in chapter one because he was the
[58:42] greatest how can you say that I'm
[58:44] insignificant you know that you are
[58:46] great in the eyes of many people and you
[58:48] know that you're doing good you pray for
[58:50] your children you you intercede for them
[58:53] right you preach may maybe he's a
[58:55] preacher in his time he has all the
[58:57] possessions he doesn't need the help of
[58:59] other people see you know I was
[59:01] wondering before when I came into into
[59:04] the message and was doing Mission Works
[59:06] I said why would the Lord not bless the
[59:09] Philippines in as much as the United
[59:12] States or Europe European countries
[59:15] where they have the the the purchase
[59:17] power of the dollar is more powerful
[59:18] than the pesos right it was a puzzle to
[59:21] me because I always say that you are you
[59:24] are uh serving the same God that we are
[59:27] serving amen so if God can bless you
[59:29] here maybe God can bless us there but
[59:32] you know as I grow older I realize that
[59:35] God makes other countries poor other
[59:38] countries Rich so they can interact with
[59:40] each other so they will depend on one
[59:43] another so the rich will have the
[59:45] compassion to help the poor the poor
[59:47] will have the humility to ask from the
[59:49] rich right it's not I I I I have my
[59:52] own or I I will say in our church we do
[59:55] Mission work works with have our own
[59:56] funds and that makes you somebody
[59:59] greater you you you think you're you
[1:00:01] don't need anybody but because the Lord
[1:00:03] make us different right yes sir and so
[1:00:06] God will use everybody to help everybody
[1:00:09] amen you can preach in our church I can
[1:00:11] preach in here brothers from Jamaica can
[1:00:13] go here and preach we can you can go
[1:00:15] preach to the India and the cambodians
[1:00:17] when they received the message they went
[1:00:19] to us and came preach for us and then
[1:00:22] you see that's the the way the gift is
[1:00:24] going F Ministry perfecting the Saints
[1:00:28] doing their different ways but the thing
[1:00:31] is we depend on one another we cannot
[1:00:34] live alone as as as the ad says no man
[1:00:36] is an island and I said no church should
[1:00:39] isolate himself and don't have
[1:00:41] fellowship with other churches amen
[1:00:43] right so we we're just thankful for the
[1:00:46] open Fellowship that we have and so
[1:00:48] here's Moses and here's job and
[1:00:51] everything was stripped in their in what
[1:00:53] they have right and so we go to the Old
[1:00:56] Testament to the New Testament the same
[1:00:59] thing happened to the apostles right it
[1:01:01] it's the very same thing you know Peter
[1:01:04] like Peter was uh was with the Lord for
[1:01:07] three and a half years right he was he
[1:01:10] was doing he was like the leader of the
[1:01:11] Apostles he was the oldest I believe in
[1:01:13] the among the apostles and and the Lord
[1:01:15] called him personally from from being a
[1:01:18] fisherman he was not just an ordinary
[1:01:20] fisherman I think he was he was a he was
[1:01:23] an expert fisherman that he is he he was
[1:01:26] fishing all his life his father and
[1:01:27] mother might be fishermen also so he
[1:01:30] knows everything but one day God called
[1:01:32] him and God told him from this time on
[1:01:35] you will not be fishermen but a Fishers
[1:01:37] of Men In other words from a from a
[1:01:39] secular job to a right Ministry a sacred
[1:01:43] position he has to leave everything not
[1:01:45] all of us are called to leave our former
[1:01:47] job right but there will be people who
[1:01:49] will be called to leave your job and go
[1:01:52] to the
[1:01:53] ministry right and you know sacrifice
[1:01:56] everything and you know go to the to I
[1:01:58] would say the the Narrow Path the the
[1:02:01] the The Road Less travel I was called
[1:02:03] when I was 30 I I I mean 33 uh uh to to
[1:02:07] be in the ministry I have a I would say
[1:02:09] a promising career in in in the field
[1:02:12] that I chose but uh but the Lord was
[1:02:14] calling me and you know when the Lord
[1:02:16] calls you you have to to
[1:02:19] to to let it go and it it took me a
[1:02:22] while to really Let It Go I mean I
[1:02:24] already quit from my secular job but in
[1:02:27] my heart I'm still in my job right
[1:02:29] that's why when I was 40 and I became I
[1:02:31] became a pastor uh I went back to my
[1:02:34] former job and worked and you know
[1:02:36] things are not are not that the same
[1:02:39] anymore I thought I I thought I I would
[1:02:41] do good in my career but uh I realized
[1:02:44] that it was it was not my skills it was
[1:02:47] not it it was only by the grace of God
[1:02:49] and this thing happened to Peter you
[1:02:51] know and uh he he was there he was uh he
[1:02:56] was uh serving the lord he was he we
[1:03:00] would say in our modern times he went
[1:03:01] full-time in serving the lord right and
[1:03:04] in in um in Luke uh chapter 22 let me
[1:03:08] just uh read this he said Luke chapter
[1:03:10] 22 uh verse 31 he said and the Lord said
[1:03:14] Simon Simon behold Satan that desired to
[1:03:17] have you that he may sift you a sweep so
[1:03:20] the devil is not happy amen Satan is not
[1:03:23] happy when we are doing what we are to
[1:03:26] do right but but he said this the Lord
[1:03:29] Jesus saying but I have prayed for thee
[1:03:31] that thy faith fail not and when thou
[1:03:34] art converted strengthen thy Brethren so
[1:03:37] he was in the ministry but he was not
[1:03:39] yet converted right he was not yet
[1:03:41] converted but he said when you are
[1:03:43] converted strengthen your brethren and
[1:03:45] you know Peter with this kind of
[1:03:47] attitude he always had this attitude
[1:03:49] that he is better than the others and
[1:03:51] said he said to the Lord Lord I am ready
[1:03:53] to go with thee both into prison into
[1:03:56] that and we know that's that's a lie
[1:03:58] yeah it it is not true he he he he he
[1:04:01] you know he speaks faster than what he
[1:04:02] thinks right yeah see and he said I tell
[1:04:06] thee Peter the shall not grow this
[1:04:08] day before thou shallal tries deny that
[1:04:10] thou knowest me and we we know that
[1:04:12] happened right he denied the Lord three
[1:04:15] times uh and so this is this is Peter
[1:04:19] see so it was the breaking time of Peter
[1:04:24] right now he realized later after he
[1:04:25] denied the Lord Jesus Christ that he's
[1:04:28] not good after all what he said that he
[1:04:30] will be with the Lord in prison or in
[1:04:32] death it's not true because he denied he
[1:04:35] he denied the Lord right so if you look
[1:04:38] on the next because you know these
[1:04:40] gospels they see the different angles
[1:04:42] right and here is John seeing how Peter
[1:04:46] after he was broken in his Spirit right
[1:04:49] now this is another Peter this is
[1:04:51] another Peter uh a different attitude of
[1:04:54] Peter now this is in John the last
[1:04:56] chapter of John uh Book of John is in 21
[1:04:59] he said after these things Jesus showed
[1:05:01] himself again to the disciples at the
[1:05:04] Sea of tiberias and the wise show
[1:05:06] themselves and so they Simon Peter was
[1:05:08] there and said in verse three Simon
[1:05:10] Peter said unto them I go of fishing and
[1:05:13] you will tell I thought the Lord already
[1:05:15] called you out of fishing but here is
[1:05:18] Peter he wanted to go back to his
[1:05:20] profession he loves so fishing so much
[1:05:23] right that he will quit the ministry and
[1:05:26] go back to fishing and you know why he
[1:05:28] quit the ministry because he said I
[1:05:30] failed my
[1:05:32] Lord then he realized now that I thought
[1:05:35] I was the great Apostle Peter but he was
[1:05:37] not he said maybe if he would TR to
[1:05:40] dramatize it a little bit but Peter
[1:05:42] would said I thought I loved the Lord I
[1:05:45] served the Lord but now I denied him so
[1:05:48] I don't have any face you know to to to
[1:05:50] face him anymore so maybe just maybe
[1:05:53] I'll just go back to what I'm good at
[1:05:55] right he cannot go to farming he doesn't
[1:05:58] know farming he cannot be an uh an IT
[1:06:01] expert because there was no computer
[1:06:03] during that time so he went back to
[1:06:05] fishing the the profession he thought he
[1:06:07] was good at and God has to teach him
[1:06:09] another lesson amen right so when he go
[1:06:11] fishing was there overnight and they
[1:06:13] found no fish I mean a veteran Fisher
[1:06:16] would know what is the right time to go
[1:06:18] to the Sea and where is the right place
[1:06:21] where the seas are we have Pastors in
[1:06:22] the Philippines who are good in fishing
[1:06:24] and when they just go out to the the
[1:06:26] middle of the sea they go back with all
[1:06:28] you know many fish because they're
[1:06:30] expert on it right and I can go to the
[1:06:32] middle of the sea and I can I I I'll be
[1:06:35] lost yeah because I I I am a city boy I
[1:06:38] don't I don't belong to the in the I
[1:06:40] don't know farming I don't know fishing
[1:06:42] I don't I know how to eat fish but I
[1:06:44] don't know how fishing see but uh but uh
[1:06:48] but this but this Peter you know he
[1:06:50] knows everything about fishing right but
[1:06:53] God showed him you are not a good Fisher
[1:06:55] yeah you think you are but you are not
[1:06:58] and now here is is Peter you know
[1:07:01] toiling all night and finding no fish
[1:07:04] and then the Lord shows himself am and
[1:07:06] said throw it to the right side right
[1:07:08] right and he throw it to the right side
[1:07:09] he found fish so all the while think
[1:07:12] Peter was thinking I'm a good Fisher but
[1:07:15] it was not him who's good it was the
[1:07:17] Lord who because it was his training
[1:07:20] right he it was his training because
[1:07:22] later in the years in your life he'll be
[1:07:24] fishing men yes amen right so the same
[1:07:27] principle that he's using throwing the
[1:07:29] net to the fish is the same principle
[1:07:31] that he will throw the gospel net to the
[1:07:33] people but this time is not fishes
[1:07:36] anymore it's souls for the glory of the
[1:07:38] Lord so he he didn't went much away you
[1:07:42] know from from from the from his calling
[1:07:44] and so we we we we see the next uh event
[1:07:48] that happened you know um the Lord was
[1:07:50] asking him Peter do you love me right
[1:07:52] and you know the translation Peter do
[1:07:54] you agapo me
[1:07:56] right it's it's the highest form of love
[1:07:58] and Peter would answer Lord I just filo
[1:08:01] you right I mean Peter could not say
[1:08:04] Lord I love you I will go with you until
[1:08:06] your dead because he knows he failed the
[1:08:08] Lord already he was broken already so he
[1:08:11] was humble Lord I I love you just a
[1:08:13] little bit not too much three times he
[1:08:16] has denied three times the Lord asked
[1:08:18] him and after three times he said this
[1:08:20] is not the same Peter said Lord I really
[1:08:23] cannot reach that level of love for you
[1:08:25] yeah
[1:08:26] and the Lord said no we can start from
[1:08:27] where you are that's Grace that's Grace
[1:08:31] right whatever we have just give it to
[1:08:33] the Lord then we can start on that small
[1:08:35] thing amen see but this is not the same
[1:08:37] Peter that oh Lord my other fellow
[1:08:40] disciples may not love you the way I
[1:08:42] love you but no he said Lord because he
[1:08:45] knows already
[1:08:48] failed he was already broken in spirit
[1:08:50] but this time you know you know the rest
[1:08:52] of the story he was used mightily by the
[1:08:54] Lord he was not when he was crucified he
[1:08:57] wanted himself crucified upside down
[1:08:58] because he he felt that he not it's not
[1:09:01] uh fitting for him to Die the way the
[1:09:03] Lord died yeah think about a broken
[1:09:07] Spirit he had a broken Spirit right and
[1:09:11] many years later I mean uh after the
[1:09:14] Lord uh left the sin there's another
[1:09:16] Apostle by the name of Paul and we know
[1:09:18] his testimony how how uh he was riding
[1:09:22] uh uh uh on on their way going to to the
[1:09:26] journey going to Damascus and just just
[1:09:28] take note of of the words of Paul here
[1:09:30] in chapter nine of the book of a said
[1:09:32] and so yet breathing out of out
[1:09:34] threatenings and Slaughter against the
[1:09:36] Disciples of the Lord went unto the high
[1:09:39] priest and decided of him letters to
[1:09:41] Damascus to the synagogues that if he uh
[1:09:46] that if he found any of this way whether
[1:09:47] they were men or women he might bring
[1:09:49] them bound unto Jerusalem so it's it was
[1:09:51] like Paul he was still he was still
[1:09:54] marveling how how he killed you know
[1:09:57] Stephen and all the Christians and and
[1:09:59] maybe he was telling oh did you see how
[1:10:02] how he slash these people and I ordered
[1:10:04] the killing of them he was too proudful
[1:10:06] you that uh he was he was marveling as
[1:10:09] in h his accomplishment and he went to
[1:10:11] the high priest and said okay give me
[1:10:12] the permit I will kill them all right
[1:10:15] that that that's Paul I mean Saul right
[1:10:18] he he was not yet converted during the
[1:10:20] time and as he Jour the Bible said he
[1:10:23] came near Damascus this is the point
[1:10:25] that will be you know broken by the Lord
[1:10:27] right amen and you see there was a light
[1:10:31] that s suddenly shined and and he said
[1:10:33] in the verse for he fell to the Earth
[1:10:35] yes am you know the Earth he fell to the
[1:10:37] dust amen from dust Thou Art to dust
[1:10:39] thou return you know a person who is in
[1:10:42] the dust can never fall right how can
[1:10:45] you fall deeper than the dust right
[1:10:48] unless you dig a ground then you you
[1:10:50] sink yourself in that hole but uh uh
[1:10:52] that means Paul was from from from
[1:10:55] somebody became a nobody right amen he
[1:10:57] was in the dust of the Earth right he
[1:11:00] was there see and he got blind he was
[1:11:04] strip from the things that he thought he
[1:11:06] had right he was the Pharisee of the
[1:11:08] Pharisees was very intelligent he was an
[1:11:11] intellectual uh intellectual preacher
[1:11:14] and and the prophet spoke many times
[1:11:16] about uh having the the what you call
[1:11:18] the intellectual conception against the
[1:11:21] spiritual Revelation and you can click
[1:11:23] that in the computer and you said it's
[1:11:25] just a mental conception it's just a
[1:11:27] mental conception these are all
[1:11:29] intellectual conception we can have the
[1:11:30] message intellectually amen this
[1:11:33] explains why why many ministers even
[1:11:37] Ministers of message Believers been in
[1:11:39] the message for many many many years
[1:11:41] then suddenly just a click of a finger
[1:11:43] they will leave the message not only
[1:11:46] leave the message but will forsake the
[1:11:47] message go against the message and leave
[1:11:50] and and you will see if they they you
[1:11:52] look at their life they go back to the
[1:11:54] world right they don't remain to be a
[1:11:56] Christian they would say that they're a
[1:11:57] Christian but the way they look I I've
[1:12:00] seen that in different countries I've
[1:12:01] seen that in our country that if they
[1:12:02] start leaving the message the first
[1:12:04] thing the women will do they will cut
[1:12:06] their hair they'll put earrings the
[1:12:08] first thing the men will do they will
[1:12:09] put tattoos in their their it is as if
[1:12:12] they were doing this for many years
[1:12:14] right but it was not in their heart
[1:12:16] because it was only intellectual
[1:12:18] conception see so as I always say this
[1:12:20] is a marathon race right this is not a
[1:12:23] Sprint see the the the journey that we
[1:12:26] are at we have to finish until the end
[1:12:28] and you know when you are when you are
[1:12:30] when you when you run a marathon Race
[1:12:32] you do not start fast you do not start
[1:12:35] strong you just keep on pacing and
[1:12:37] pacing until but when the last about 200
[1:12:40] meters away you dash to the Finish Line
[1:12:43] that's the way we do it amen but you can
[1:12:45] see a believer that so is strong at
[1:12:47] first you will see after a few years he
[1:12:50] will leave the message it's like you're
[1:12:53] just cranking a car then after one mile
[1:12:56] no more gas right it's like that it's
[1:12:59] always like that wherever I go no matter
[1:13:01] what culture you belong to it's always
[1:13:03] the same see it's always the same you
[1:13:06] know God's uh principles are Universal
[1:13:11] see so God has to strip all these things
[1:13:14] from Moses from job from Peter from Paul
[1:13:17] because God will use them and God cannot
[1:13:19] use us to the to the fullest until we
[1:13:22] are stripped from every uh um thinking
[1:13:27] being self-centered that we have because
[1:13:29] you will just you know you will just be
[1:13:31] puffed up no I I I was telling when I
[1:13:34] was in Cloverdale uh because I work with
[1:13:36] them for 10 years you know I was doing
[1:13:38] all the reports Mission work reports I
[1:13:42] when when funds are coming in I will I
[1:13:44] will always the same thing as I'm doing
[1:13:47] here with brother Samuel I will account
[1:13:49] the the funds to the to the last scent
[1:13:52] AB so if it's 4 5 cents or 05 cents I
[1:13:56] will put it in the record and I it's
[1:13:58] there because I want to be a good
[1:14:00] Steward not to the people but to the
[1:14:01] Lord because I will know I will be
[1:14:03] answerable for that and I have to report
[1:14:05] all these things what happened and
[1:14:07] everything to to to to them and um for
[1:14:09] 10 years I've been doing that but I told
[1:14:13] them any one of you here remember the
[1:14:16] report I did in their pulpit in June 16
[1:14:19] 2000 year 2002 nobody
[1:14:22] Remembered at the end of the day it will
[1:14:24] just be statistic
[1:14:25] right oh I went there I baptized 100 I
[1:14:28] baptized you can baptize the whole world
[1:14:32] right see but it's just statistics y
[1:14:35] right it's just statistics sometimes if
[1:14:38] you are not careful you will say oh I'm
[1:14:39] better than them I'm better than this
[1:14:41] missionary it's it's nonsense amen see
[1:14:44] because if God will not allow us to do
[1:14:46] Mission Works we're nothing see we can
[1:14:49] go out in the field try to accomplish so
[1:14:51] many things you know before when we do
[1:14:53] Mission Works there's no camera just you
[1:14:55] just make it but now everywhere you can
[1:14:57] just with your cell phone do things and
[1:15:00] and make it appear make it appear that
[1:15:02] it was so hard for you you're eating
[1:15:05] Stone you're eating grass yeah but it's
[1:15:07] not true it's not true right right oh I
[1:15:11] I ate this I ate that I stayed there I
[1:15:13] stayed there it has no score when you go
[1:15:16] to heaven there's no score
[1:15:18] no it's it's in the motive of the heart
[1:15:22] we are looking for the last
[1:15:23] predestinated seed that's what end time
[1:15:25] evangelism is all about look for the
[1:15:27] last but the prophet said what is end
[1:15:29] time evangelism end time evangelism is
[1:15:31] looking for the last predestinated seed
[1:15:34] so it's not for everybody and shaping
[1:15:36] the stone he said stone is your
[1:15:39] confession and but a but but a stone
[1:15:42] needs a a a a a Mason Stone Mason to
[1:15:45] shape that means we can go out of
[1:15:47] missions to look for the last
[1:15:48] predestinated seed or to look for this
[1:15:51] message believers who are not yet really
[1:15:53] matured enough so you use the gift of
[1:15:55] teaching to mature the people but the
[1:15:57] end of the day it is not our
[1:15:59] accomplishment that's right it's not our
[1:16:01] accomplishment see they will forget all
[1:16:04] about you y yeah see but as long as they
[1:16:07] remember what you have preached to them
[1:16:09] then you have mission accomplished right
[1:16:11] amen okay many years ago I was in
[1:16:13] Germany I was invited there to preach in
[1:16:16] in in a certain church and they said go
[1:16:19] to this church we have an Outreach 200
[1:16:21] um 200 miles away from the the main
[1:16:23] church so I went there it was a house
[1:16:25] Church they welcome me you know the the
[1:16:29] German the German bride is the same as
[1:16:31] the US bride they're still they still
[1:16:34] have the southern hospitality there I
[1:16:35] don't know why but but they're very
[1:16:37] Hospital they're very good right and I
[1:16:39] preached to them and they and you know
[1:16:41] the the minister was holding that group
[1:16:43] he said brother Vernon you we were
[1:16:46] blessed in the way you preach the
[1:16:48] message you delivered and everything we
[1:16:49] will never forget you he said then that
[1:16:53] was 2008 201 I was able to go back to to
[1:16:57] Germany and I went I was there and the
[1:17:00] pastor go back to the to the same place
[1:17:03] because uh they they they're waiting for
[1:17:05] went there and the pastor the the the
[1:17:07] minister said oh brother Vernon is this
[1:17:09] the first time you went
[1:17:11] here he was telling me that he will
[1:17:13] never forget me for 24 hours but after
[1:17:17] two years he forgot everything about it
[1:17:19] so sometimes you know you I do not get
[1:17:21] flattered when people say oh we were
[1:17:23] blessed because I know it's
[1:17:25] that that's just Simple
[1:17:27] Kindness that's just respect but if you
[1:17:30] ask what did I preach well I I really
[1:17:32] did didn't understand what you
[1:17:34] said yeah and so we want to be a
[1:17:37] blessing to people but we want we don't
[1:17:40] want to put any accomplishment in our
[1:17:42] head reporting is good Mission reporting
[1:17:44] I I do Mission reports in our church
[1:17:46] because I want them to know what the
[1:17:48] Lord is doing but I it's not my
[1:17:51] intention to tell them this is your
[1:17:53] pastor this is what I do right no why
[1:17:56] because I said it's it's just statistics
[1:17:59] yes if if I baptize 100 souls and this
[1:18:02] brother baptize One Soul it doesn't
[1:18:04] matter right you did the same thing in
[1:18:07] front of the Lord see so sometimes you
[1:18:09] feel inferior because your church is
[1:18:11] small you feel inferior because your
[1:18:13] ministry is not that big but in the eyes
[1:18:15] of the Lord if you if if you became
[1:18:18] faithful to what the Lord has called you
[1:18:19] to be and I believe I believe that when
[1:18:23] you face the Lord it will just be the
[1:18:25] same right we will have our rewards for
[1:18:28] what we have done for the lord it's not
[1:18:30] just like the simple parable of the
[1:18:32] talents the Lord will not ask what he
[1:18:34] has not given to you right see so what
[1:18:37] the Lord has gave has placed in my hands
[1:18:39] I want to be faithful right I will not
[1:18:41] compare it with the with the
[1:18:43] accomplishment of other people I will
[1:18:44] not go you know this what we done this
[1:18:46] what we've done of course I need to to
[1:18:48] tell it to you to share it to you
[1:18:50] because brother samel has been engaged
[1:18:52] in the mission work in the Philippines
[1:18:53] but that is just for information
[1:18:55] purposes it has nothing to do with what
[1:18:58] I have done God could have used another
[1:18:59] person God could have used uh a brother
[1:19:03] or or a sister there that not not me but
[1:19:06] the works of the Lord will still
[1:19:08] continue why because the the right
[1:19:10] motives right so but if we think that we
[1:19:13] are better than the others then we start
[1:19:15] you
[1:19:16] know that's why even in the testimony I
[1:19:19] tell my church when you testify in front
[1:19:21] when you testify make sure that you are
[1:19:23] giving glory to the Lord that's right
[1:19:25] don't testify as if you're better than
[1:19:27] the other that's right okay that's not
[1:19:29] testimony that's putting up yourself and
[1:19:31] I said to the ministers when they go out
[1:19:33] you you make your mission report you
[1:19:36] make a mission report in such a way that
[1:19:38] the people will be blessed because of
[1:19:40] what the Lord is doing in the mission
[1:19:41] field not what you're doing not what
[1:19:44] you're are accomplishing not what you
[1:19:46] have preached you don't go to to the in
[1:19:49] front and say oh the I went there and
[1:19:50] the people were so blessed that they
[1:19:52] want don't want me to go home yeah it's
[1:19:55] all about you it's all about you right
[1:19:58] so sometimes these are little things but
[1:20:00] sometimes these little things you know
[1:20:02] you you
[1:20:03] you with so we have to look at these
[1:20:06] little things it's not so deep but you
[1:20:09] know when the Rapture comes he will be
[1:20:10] perfected right and even these little
[1:20:12] things will not be left that's right
[1:20:14] right I mean we we have to correct these
[1:20:17] little things and so uh as as I close
[1:20:20] let me open this in uh in the in the
[1:20:22] book of second Timothy in in the book of
[1:20:25] 2 Timothy Chapter 2 it says here you
[1:20:29] know how Paul is a typologist he he he
[1:20:33] always uh types the the subject that's
[1:20:38] preaching to whatever he is in the in
[1:20:40] his environment so he said in verse
[1:20:42] three he said thou therefore endure
[1:20:44] hardness as a good soldier of Jesus
[1:20:46] Christ no man that WTH ENT tangl at
[1:20:48] himself with the Affairs of this life in
[1:20:51] other words if you put it in modern
[1:20:52] language if you are if you are in the m
[1:20:54] military don't be don't entangle
[1:20:58] yourself with the civilian Affairs the
[1:21:00] civilian Affairs and so when I was 17
[1:21:02] years old I entered the military academy
[1:21:05] similar as your you United States
[1:21:07] Military Academy here in the West Point
[1:21:10] um I went there a 17year old graduate
[1:21:13] fresh graduate from high school I I went
[1:21:15] there and it was we we call it a
[1:21:18] reception day they will this this upper
[1:21:21] class cadetes will receive you and of
[1:21:22] course you are wearing your all your
[1:21:24] civilian clothes and the first thing you
[1:21:26] do you you line up in front of them and
[1:21:27] they start you know grabbing your shirt
[1:21:30] you know um wasting your shirt and
[1:21:33] everything and they will strip you from
[1:21:35] all your civilian clothes your socks
[1:21:38] even your underwear then they will they
[1:21:41] they will first put you in like a uh uh
[1:21:44] physical training push-ups and
[1:21:45] everything P craw there craw there and
[1:21:48] then they will let you remove and they
[1:21:50] will not remove you slowly but they will
[1:21:53] rip it away from you it was like a
[1:21:55] ritual because from that day on you will
[1:21:58] not be wearing civilian clothes anymore
[1:22:00] everything that you will wear are all
[1:22:02] the part of the uniform of the Armed
[1:22:04] Forces of the Philippines now there's I
[1:22:07] didn't understand it during that time
[1:22:08] but later on I understand that they're
[1:22:10] trying to give us a mindset that from
[1:22:13] that time on we will be in the military
[1:22:16] we don't have anything to do with the
[1:22:18] civilian Affairs right that everything
[1:22:21] we do we have the same color of
[1:22:23] underwear we have the same uh of course
[1:22:26] different sizes but you know you you you
[1:22:28] wear the same thing everywhere so
[1:22:30] there's no fashion see if you wear all
[1:22:33] the same all of you wearing white
[1:22:35] there's no fashion if all of us will the
[1:22:37] same the same coat I wouldn't say your
[1:22:40] coat is better than mine because it's
[1:22:43] all the same so what the military is
[1:22:46] trying to tell us to train us to is that
[1:22:48] there is equality Among Us
[1:22:50] right we are not uh we are not to be in
[1:22:53] the Affairs of the C life anymore then I
[1:22:55] became a Believer I read this I said
[1:22:58] this is the same thing that Paul is
[1:22:59] saying see when we are called to be the
[1:23:01] soldier of the of Jesus Christ we will
[1:23:03] be stripped away from anything that we
[1:23:05] know that is good for us and God will
[1:23:08] give us something not not our
[1:23:10] righteousness but his robe of
[1:23:12] righteousness no no longer our
[1:23:14] righteousness because it it looks like
[1:23:16] filthy rugs in the Lord in the in the
[1:23:18] eyes of the Lord but he will he will
[1:23:20] cloth us with his righteousness meaning
[1:23:23] everything that we will from that time
[1:23:25] on any accomplishment that we will make
[1:23:28] any if we will be a Channel of blessing
[1:23:30] to other because the lord always bless
[1:23:32] us so we can be a blessing right and so
[1:23:36] if we can whe we can be a blessing to
[1:23:37] others it's because God blessed us first
[1:23:41] it's not because we are good people it's
[1:23:43] not because uh we are better than the
[1:23:47] others and if we think that we are
[1:23:49] better that then God will break us until
[1:23:52] ouro spirit is broken and we can say
[1:23:54] lord it's not me it's all about you it's
[1:23:57] all about you
[1:23:59] see anything that we will do hence forth
[1:24:02] from this time we will think no Lord
[1:24:04] this is just a privilege for me even I
[1:24:07] tell my church as a pastor it's just a
[1:24:09] privilege I know one day if I get old if
[1:24:12] the Lord will will T and I will I will
[1:24:14] still be here and I cannot preach
[1:24:18] anymore I have to give up I have to give
[1:24:21] it to somebody else but until then the
[1:24:24] Lord wants to use me and keeps me that's
[1:24:27] why the Lord will will always give
[1:24:30] something to us to keep us humble in our
[1:24:32] way yeah when he say we are Sons and
[1:24:35] Daughters of God and so he he sees you
[1:24:38] going astray what will he do we'll do
[1:24:41] something that will humble you always
[1:24:44] humble us but if you're not humble
[1:24:46] enough you will look at the child why is
[1:24:49] the son of this brother why is the
[1:24:50] sister of this brother why is the wife
[1:24:52] why is the husband like this see
[1:24:55] you have no compassion you want to
[1:24:58] convict everybody that is not according
[1:25:00] to your standard right see but then I
[1:25:04] learned later in in the later years of
[1:25:06] my life as a message believer it's not
[1:25:08] about our standard it's not even our
[1:25:11] standard we don't have standards if I
[1:25:14] will look at my standard my standard is
[1:25:15] far far below the standard of the Lord
[1:25:18] see but but the Lord will allow us to
[1:25:21] fall to fail to be defeated to be
[1:25:23] disappointed to be this
[1:25:25] illution okay so when that time comes
[1:25:28] that you you need to have compassion for
[1:25:30] others who cannot obey the message the
[1:25:33] way they should be we will have
[1:25:35] compassion to them see we will have
[1:25:37] compassion to them and who knows maybe
[1:25:39] the Lord will open their eyes you know
[1:25:42] and you'll be the tool for them to be
[1:25:44] matured in the message but until we
[1:25:47] really get humble in our
[1:25:50] stuff you will never see it I was
[1:25:52] telling my son my second son is very
[1:25:55] close to Brother John he sometimes
[1:25:57] because maybe of his b he's an
[1:25:59] intelligent boy he when he was in grade
[1:26:03] one uh he he was transferring school and
[1:26:07] uh sister Anna the the administrator
[1:26:09] gave her an entrance exam for grade
[1:26:12] six but it was just grade one wow but he
[1:26:16] he the the the administrator didn't know
[1:26:18] and he didn't know and he just answered
[1:26:21] everything he got it perfect an entrance
[1:26:23] exam so that's how intelligent he is see
[1:26:27] so sometimes intelligent people are good
[1:26:29] but you know when they grow up they they
[1:26:30] believe that they're then then it came
[1:26:32] to a point in her life that he is a know
[1:26:35] it all so God has to break him in so
[1:26:37] many ways so he applied to this job he
[1:26:40] he didn't find favor in the in the in
[1:26:42] the in in the eyes of the the superiors
[1:26:44] he went to this job he didn't find favor
[1:26:46] and he said he got disappointed he said
[1:26:48] Papa uh why is it like this he said I'm
[1:26:51] praying and uh you know the I'm working
[1:26:54] for companies that I cannot find favor
[1:26:56] from my superiors and I said I think the
[1:26:59] Lord is breaking your spirit yeah I
[1:27:01] think the Lord is telling you something
[1:27:03] I think the Lord is telling you to be
[1:27:05] humble enough you know don't don't don't
[1:27:07] trust in your in your own skills in your
[1:27:09] intelligence just leave it to the Lord
[1:27:11] see and you know I mean he learns it his
[1:27:15] lessons and uh he try he he humbles
[1:27:18] himself he humbled himself you know to
[1:27:20] to to to see what the Lord wants him to
[1:27:23] do I think every child of God will be
[1:27:26] like that Glory no matter how old you
[1:27:28] are what culture you belong to what what
[1:27:31] country you belong to as the as as long
[1:27:33] as the Lord wants to call you and to
[1:27:35] give you something he will give you this
[1:27:37] kind of experience and it's for our own
[1:27:39] good anyway and at the end of the day we
[1:27:42] can say Lord thank you for breaking my
[1:27:45] spirit amen and I hope that uh the Lord
[1:27:48] will help us I don't know what the Lord
[1:27:50] needs to be to be broken in our lives
[1:27:53] but he knows he knows he knows it
[1:27:55] sometimes even in the last portion of
[1:27:57] our life we will have to have this uh
[1:27:59] breaking right as I told you in a while
[1:28:03] ago brother Bram was already two years
[1:28:05] before he died he still he he he still
[1:28:07] wanted the Lord to correct his motives
[1:28:09] and objectives how much more us amen we
[1:28:11] don't know when we will die or when the
[1:28:13] Lord will come but that will be my
[1:28:15] prayer for this January Lord if you can
[1:28:17] see anything in my heart any motives any
[1:28:20] intentions and objectives that's not
[1:28:22] right with you yes will you correct it
[1:28:25] for me right I will not wait for the
[1:28:27] time that he was to put me in this kind
[1:28:29] of situation that my spirit will be
[1:28:31] broken I will cry right see don't don't
[1:28:33] don't why why will you walk near the
[1:28:36] edge if you can walk in the middle right
[1:28:39] it's much safer it's much always much
[1:28:41] safer so can we close our eyes for a
[1:28:44] while and uh let's just pray to the Lord
[1:28:46] as I before I bring it back to our
[1:28:50] pastor our gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[1:28:54] your message is a message of restoration
[1:28:57] your message is a message of Grace it is
[1:28:59] a message that will lead us to our
[1:29:01] rightful position to be adopted as your
[1:29:04] sons and daughters and Lord having this
[1:29:08] message in our life means more than
[1:29:10] anything to us but Lord this message is
[1:29:12] not just for deep doctrines this message
[1:29:14] is not just to give us an intellectual
[1:29:17] conception Lord but uh this message is
[1:29:20] for us to have a spiritual Revelation to
[1:29:23] know who we are in your sight to know
[1:29:26] which part of the body we belong to and
[1:29:28] Lord we pray and I pray Lord for our my
[1:29:30] brothers and my sisters here whom I

[1:29:37] including myself Lord that you will give
[1:29:39] us a humble heart a humble enough Lord
[1:29:42] to accept our mistakes that if they will
[1:29:45] have any any accomplishment in our life
[1:29:47] we will always give the glory to you we
[1:29:50] will speak it to other people in such a
[1:29:52] way not to to raise up ourself Lord but
[1:29:56] in such a way that we will just be
[1:29:58] showing them how you work in our life
[1:30:01] it's all about you Lord you you must
[1:30:03] increase in our life and we must
