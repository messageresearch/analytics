========================================

let's just bow our heads Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather today Lord we ask Lord that you'll just prepare our hearts Lord God as we become ready to receive Lord from you this morning I pray Lord as we just study your word Lord that you'll help us that you grant us understanding Lord we ask your blessing upon the service today in the name of the Lord amen I I know that's a little bit small just bear with me while I read through but we we're going to make our way to verse 20 8 now we're we're we're going through Hebrews chapter 9 and and I almost made it chapter 10 and it says in verse 24 it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heaven should be purified with these but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these for Christ has not entered into the holy places made made with hands which are the figures of the truth but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the Judgment so Christ was once offered to up bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation now uh I think last time I kind of pulled up some different translations of this scripture that we just kind of just kind of meditate on and unpack for a few minutes what and and take a look at that that word appear that that Christ would appear he he came he appeared the first time to die for our sins and the second time to finish the Redemption so the New Living Translation if you want to look at that it says he's going to come again not to deal with our sins but to bring Salvation to all who eagerly are are eagerly waiting for him and the Amplified Bible say says so Christ having been offered once and once and once for all to bear and and in in parenthesis as a burden the sins of many will appear a second time when he returns to earth not to deal with sin but to bring Salvation to those who are eagerly and confidently waiting for him and the Aramaic Bible in plain English says in this way also the Messiah was offered one time and he slaughtered in his person the sins of the many but the second time he appears without our sins for the life of those who expect him and in the Waymouth New Testament version says so the Christ also having been offered once offered in sacrifice in order that he might bear the sins of many will appear a second time separated from sin to those who are eagerly expecting him to make their salvation complete so he died he appeared once on the scene to die on the cross and then will appear the second time to finish the work of Salvation now brother B said in 1962 and God is has a provided way he said which one of the prophets did your now now kind of keep in mind we're going to kind of separate and kind of talk about the appearing versus the coming and what brother Ram said about those things and he said which one of the prophets did your fathers not Stone because they didn't know their day if you'd have known me You' have known my day they didn't know John until he was dead buried so now John is proclaiming that Christ is here and then Jesus came and they didn't recognize him he said they didn't know Jesus till he died till he dead buried they didn't know St Patrick Joan of art the Catholic church burn her as a witch to the post because the woman had power and prayer and saw visions and they said she was a fortune teller a witch and they burnt that woman screaming for Mercy oh of course you'd done Penance 200 years later dug up them priest's body and throw them but it passed by you and you didn't know it even the disciples said why does the scribes say Elias must first come said Elias has already come and you didn't know it goes over your head and you didn't know it don't miss it now now see remember go back to what Paul is saying here in verse 28 and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time to those that look for him and can recognize so to finish that quote he said now remember these two words before I leave you the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ is two different things Christ is now appearing in the fullness of his power his coming will be afterwards his appearing before his coming God be merciful and and just to kind of borrow an example that uh I was listening to a sermon that brother Wade preached back in 20 uh 10 years ago and he was using the example of down through the Old Testament you could see the the that God would appear in in the lives of of uh all of these Old Testament prophets and then finally he comes upon the scene and so what's what's the difference really if you if you meditate on the appearing and the coming the appearing and the coming is the perspective of where you are the coming of the Lord is that Christ revealing himself personally to you but if his Christ is not you you could be in a church service and see see uh I like somebody you know you hear people testify of seeing that eyes actually appear in little boy's head and brother R's meetings and see Christ actually appearing and manifesting himself but yet God will not reveal his word to you if you're not born again so you can see that you can be in in a church service where you can see Christ appearing and being manifested and and uh hair being restored that's lost and signs and wonders being done and in the lives of Christ and the people and God appearing but yet not recognize his coming amen now you see the coming of the Lord is it's almost like to to use an example like a snowball that that really you know you could almost say that the coming of the Lord started on the day of Pentecost and begin to snowball down until Christ is here and he's he's come and then we meet him in the clouds we go to meet him in the in the skies and we we see him visibly he's he's here and then move on into the uh when he physically comes back uh like the scripture says on a white horse riding with his Saints metaphorically speaking of the of the of him returning back in the in the Millennium so it's it's like a snowball where he's he's he's precept upon precept line upon line adding until till he's manifest and so you see how the we we'll say things like you know the Rapture is taking place right now and you could be missing it if you don't recognize his coming because the Rapture is a process where the word is being built up within us until it it it it it comes to a uh comes to a head comes to a headstone so brother R would say in from that time in 1962 he says how many knows there's a difference between the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ it's two different words now is the appearing the coming will soon be he's appearing in the midst of us doing the works that he once did in his church now you're are part of that church church and by Grace you believe I'm a member of that church you can see the pattern that's that he's kind of laying down you know there's so many that sat in brother R's meetings back then when he'd say it's and they'd see Christ appearing and Christ Christ being made manifest in their midst and yet not recognize the word that he was preaching but I think see that now we're we're we're I believe we're at a different place where back then that people sitting there didn't he was preaching to denominational people and people that didn't really believe what he he was preaching but now we're we're we're what a privilege to be able to preach to people that believe what what brother R preached and we're we're actually have an opportunity now to really do what brother random even never never fully had an opportunity to do to preach to people that knew what the message was and could recognize the coming of the Lord so you can see you can see the difference now when when when Christ was there in those meetings but so and he he appeared to people in the meetings and his his appearance was made known but yet they didn't recognize that Christ was there so brother R said and we would see Jesus he said now what why didn't we he see he why didn't he do those signs for the Gentiles it never was performed by him why Gentiles wasn't looking for no Messiah it goes back to what Paul's saying unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation they were heathens we were our people Romans and so forth back there with a club on their back worshiping Idols they wasn't looking for no Messiah and Messiah only comes to those who are looking for him that's the only way to them that look for him will he appear the second time just those who are looking for him not just to who pertaining but those who are really looking for him and notice he never come to Gentile that miracle was never performed before a gentile and the unchangeable God now we've had 2,000 years of scholarship and all kinds of things and now it's come evening time and now the Gentiles are looking for a coming Messiah now if he's the same he appeared the same then to them two tribes he's got to appear the same way there and promised though now you see the pattern that brother bram's laying out is that John the Baptist introduced that that Christ was here and now now brother brandham that the Elijah in this day was to introduce that he's come to introduce the coming Messiah so brother ramman and it is I be not afraid he said now when Jesus was on Earth he declared himself to be the Messiah and John declared there was a Messi sign followed him and the Old Testament claimed there' be a Old Testament claimed there'd be a messic sign and he proved that sign to the people that he was the Messiah how they know it was he was a god Prophet Mo Moses the one that they had followed said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like an unto me we know that we're aware of that and amongst the Jews and the Samaritans he showed the sign but of course he never amongst the Gentiles because we were heathens in those days our people the Gentiles Romans we wasn't looking for no Messiah and Messiah only appears to those who's looking for him that's the way those who wait for him he will appear the second time so it would behoove us tonight to be waiting for him and watching for him that we do not miss it when he comes and brother Ram back in and and when what was the Holy Ghost given for he said he was talking about baptizing the 17th person there on the Ohio River and he said and a voice spoke as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ you'll have a message that'll forerun the second coming of Christ and it was showing forth his coming down down through so you we you can see that pattern of the messenger and and I'm taking a step back just so you can see the difference here as we as we kind of meditate on this and from that time he said people are unconcerned just exactly like it was in the days of Sodom just exactly like it was in the days of Noah scoffers fun makers the angel of the Lord is here and the last sign that he promised to give the church is now appearing amongst the people and they don't recognize it what did those phes standing there religious good people church members fine people they said in their hearts in their hearts not with their lips they said this man is a spiritualist a fortune teller beells above he does that by the prince of the Devils beells above now you think about what a great thing that God would actually appear in the midst of the people and raise up a man from the dead and he'd be sitting there and they wouldn't recognize it that God would appear and they couldn't recognize to recognize that God's presence I'll use another example I'm G borrow a lot from Brother Wade this morning that he another example was Cain and Esau that Cain could not recognize that that God would would consume Abel's sacrifice with a Holy Fire come down with the fire of God and consume that off the Altar and would still not do what he saw Abel doing but Abel did it by Revelation so there's there there's your difference the coming of the Lord is a revelation to you personally of who Jesus Christ is that's built up within you like a snowball until God is there on the scene till actually God is is moving manifesting himself in the midst of the people and yet people don't recognize it like the Pharisees and and and all them back there that said that Jesus was the devil so in perseverance brother R said so the Lord is now appearing among his people great signs and wonders raising the dead Healing The Sick and doing the very same things that he did that hasn't been done for 2,000 years see the church is honed up through that brought up till it's right at the time The Headstone is coming to meet the church and then it'll all go together and be raptured he said and behold a greater than Solomon is here as Jonah was in the belly of the well the son of man will be in the heart of their Earth many people today think he's still there but he's not dead he's risen from the dead and he's here with us now appearing Among Us proving himself up and down the coast around the world everywhere that he lives and the wicked and an adulterous generation sees a sign that Jesus Christ is alive and not dead a wicked and an adulterous generation will seek after a sign and they'll get it the sign of the Resurrection let it soak real deep now study hard and he said and Jehovah Gyra this is the close of the royal seed's waiting he's hear the appearing of Christ there's a place in the Bible you know I ain't got time to go into US says the appearing of Christ and then the coming of Christ there's two that's two different things all together the appearing and the coming he's appearing now working with us in the form of the Holy Spirit making it just perfect the church it has to like if you got a dollar bill in your pocket take it out and look on one side it's the American seal on the other side it's an Egyptian seal the pyramid with a headstone way up above it like an eye looking and why would American dollar put beneath their there the Great Seal looked like the American seal would be the Great Seal there but the United States government recognizes it whether they want to or not the Great Seal watch that pyramid as he shapes up the church justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and then that's got to be honed out to When The Headstone never did come to the pyramid it was rejected just like the Cornerstone now but when that headstone comes I've been to the pyramid it's just so perfectly fit you couldn't run a razor blade between between it where the mortar is at and when the church comes when Christ comes to receive his church the church will have the ministry just exactly like that and through that Grace will raise the whole thing then go the coming of The Headstone crying Grace under the Lord now as we read that quote I I hope maybe you can see how it's kind of difficult to even express these thoughts that the coming and the appearing could be together and they're yet different and the coming could be in the the future but yet now because the coming of the Lord is we're waiting for the coming of The Headstone but yet Christ is coming now as he Reveals His word he's revealing but he's going to be present when The Headstone comes we're looking for The Headstone comes we're looking to see Christ bodily one day in the Millennium we're looking to see but but now Christ is coming now and even now as he's coming yet you could be looking at it and observing the influence of the coming of the Lord and Christ would be appearing to you and you not recognize it so we don't we don't want to now we want app the appearing is not just something bad you know people will say well we don't want the appearing no we want this morning we want as we as we open our hearts to receive the spirit we want to see Christ appearing in our midst we want to see we want to observe the actual Christ manifesting himself in the body of Believers but how much greater to see the word open up to you to see Christ reveal himself to to see him like like he he gave that promise he said I will not leave you comfortless but I will come to you now there is the coming of the Lord that Christ will reveal himself through his word and open himself up to you now if we let me just kind of skip over this I'm we know we know all these scriptures about Elias truly shall first come and and looking for because what what is Eliah supposed to do Elijah Elijah will Malachi 456 the promise that that God is going to send an introducer to to shift our thinking back to the original mode the original way that the original deci deciples and apostles thought so that we would be prepared to receive the coming of the Lord which is the fullness of his word in this age in the season that we're living in now the Jews will look at this scripture and they'll say they know that Elijah is going to come before the Messiah so Elijah is is a as a precursor before the fullness of the word before their before their Messiah comes so they on Passover they they leave this spot at the table because they know Messiah is coming so so when you whenever you see whenever you see look in the scripture and see how John the Baptist came the son of man's coming right after that the fullness of the word in flesh whenever you look into the Bible and see how Elijah is coming in Malachi 456 and promise that here comes the fullness of the word right after that and see we get our we get our our our mind so much sometimes on the man but after the the man's got a message and that message when people begin to receive it then that word begins to be made manifest in their life life so now the Jews are looking for they've got this place set at the table and if you look on the internet of what the what the what what that mean what the Jews think about that it says Jewish tradition teaches that Elijah the prophet will be the harbinger of the coming of the Messiah and the world's Redemption it is a chair of hope that chair that they that place they leave at the at the table at the Passover Elijah's Cup in Judaism the fifth ceremonial cup of wine poured during the family Cedar dinner on Passover is left untouched in honor of a who according to belief will arrive one day as an unknown guest to Herold the Advent of the Messiah his presence now think about this that's so overlooked in the world today that we're living in when Elijah comes his presence signifies that the Messiah is here his presence signals the Messianic era a time of redemption peace and spiritual Bliss the full cup one for the future remains untouched to honor another Hospitality an offer Hospitality to Elijah when he ultimately appears so go back to what Paul's saying here so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many he died on the cross for us but he's going to appear again and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation now didn't Christ appear to us in this day visibly immediately you've heard people testify where they'd go into meetings and they they they felt such a presence that they knew that when they as soon as they walked through the doors they knew God was there and I was I was listening to a a testimony online where this this this lady she had bobbed hair and she was obviously not a message believer but she was talking about standing in the in in the in the prayer line in brother Brown's meetings and she looked down while brother Brown was praying for her and saw a wheel in the middle of the wheel turning as as as God as brother Brown SP the voice of the Lord through brother Brown spoke her healing to her now see there's the appearing that you can see God actually manifest and yet not recognize because God's word is not revealed to you she received her healing you see how much greater is it for God to reveal himself to you and come to you and and and just we'll compare it like this that sitting on the on the hill side listening to Jesus while he passed out bread and fish and they could see God that God was there but yet not recognized the word that he was speaking to them right what's the coming of the Lord I will not leave you comfortless I I will come to you like a snowball until at the very end at the End of the Age Christ is made manifest not maybe so much in the little man but in you and these people sitting here looking at me those people sitting in brother Brown this is a if you can look real hard and squint real hard you can see brother Brown down on the stage preaching and and how many of those people recognized that Christ was in their midst and felt the anointing and saw God appearing but yet failed to understand the revelation of Jesus Jesus Christ brother Ram said in in the message look he said now if you just look upon it say I got a little crucifix hanging my in my car I got one at my home a cross that's all right but that ain't what it is that's not what he's talking about you got to see that God knows that you are a sinner those that look for him shall he appear and that you have confessed your sins and God put your iniquity upon Him upon his and and become a man he crossed his strain and come down from being God to be man that he might die die in your stead to give his for you and you confessed your sin and not a manufactured Clorox but a power of God that was made blood that he might take away your sinful Blood by sexual desire and make you a free man and woman of God there you are what are you looking at you say I belong so now now reason I put this slide in here let's take a step back is to show the difference between the appearing and the coming because it depends on how you're looking you can look with just your natural eyes and see Christ being made manifest in the meeting and and enjoy the anointing but if you look with your with your spiritual life with by faith because manifestation is not the evidence but faith is the evidence of things hoped for faith is the evidence of your new birth so if you're looking by faith that it changes the picture if you're looking that's the coming of the Lord to you when he reveals himself to you what are you looking at you say I belong to a denomination Assemblies of God I belong to the United Pentecost cost I belong to the Methodist the Baptist you're still focusing way Focus yourself in on Jesus Christ he the answer come back all thy sins which are many are all forgiven now see see brother brandom come to to to to preach a word that would loose the holy spirit in our lives and so many cannot see see what his purpose was and I I just kind of as an example before we close up here I'm we I think we've all seen that that comic strip of penuts where let's just read through this I wish I could blow it up even more but he says all right golf oh I can blow it up great I don't have my glasses I'm I'm getting older y'all I need all right golf fans this is it the old pro has to make this one he's down to the last put and he can't play it safe he has to go for it There's No Tomorrow there's no tomorrow there's no tomorrow they just announced on TV that There's No Tomorrow there's no tomorrow they just announced it on TV panic panic run hide flee Run for the hills flee to The Valleys run to the rooftops but then they hold hold on a second if there's no tomorrow wait something was supposed to happen first somehow I never thought it would end this way and Snoopy says I thought Elijah was to come first I see even the comic strip in the sunny paper testifies that Elijah supposed to come first why to to introduce the coming of the Lord that's why in Matthew 24 it says watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord do come but know this that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be ye also ready for in such a an hour as you think not the son of man cometh now again let's not lose context of what we're talking about that Paul said so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation he's appearing the second time to finish your work of redemption to finish everything up to come in fullness so now what what's the coming and the appearing how how are you looking if your ey if your natural Eyes Are Fixed On him you're just seeing him moving in the church you're seeing other people get a blessing you're seeing God moveing the in the spirit you're you're seeing somebody else get filled with the Holy Ghost but if you're looking by eyes of faith God is real to you like that Deacon that that was on the out on the on the boat with that little little girl in the church that asked him can you see God and he said everywhere I look I see God right cuz if you're looking by eyes of Faith you can see God in your life you can see God in the sunrise you can see God in then and nature you can see God everywhere you look you can see God how he's changing how he's changing you how he's changed your family how he's changing your church everywhere you see so now we we we want to what is the coming the coming is Christ revealing himself to you and you know uh in that in that message brother R priest where he went through all the Mysteries that had been revealed in this last day the mystery of the godhead the Kingdom of Heaven the New Testament Church is one mystery Babylon the mystery of iniquity serpent seed the Seven Stars the mystery of true Grace The Mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost yeah I'm I'm put this out here so sometimes we we don't realize what we're getting here when we come to church but it's it's building up line upon line until until you know who God is no eternal hell and water baptism the pillar of fire returning back and the true anointing that's on the bride the statute of a perfect man adoption Israel's blindness the translation of the living Saints at the end of this age and the Seven Seals that's what that's what do God has doing coming to reveal to us so in Hebrews chapter 10 oh we finished that's it we made it to Hebrews chapter 10 well let me just run through this outline before we before we close to just kind of background because in in in chapter one I know that's real small again but chapter one we talked about how the the description of God's salvation this is just an outline of of the book of Hebrews that God had provided a way for us to be saved that that he was Superior to angels and and and and Paul outlined uh that God came down in flesh and manifested himself in in Jesus Christ that that he was higher than than every Apostle and priest and anybody who had ever brought a message before in chapter in chapter three he talked about entering into God's rest and how the danger of missing that rest and and how to be disqualified from getting that rest and how the the rest is is really resting upon God's word and not on on our own ideas and and and the word of God is how we're is our is our guard it's it's our protection and then in chapter four the priesthood of of God's salvation and talked about the priesthood of melkisedek and how Christ fulfilled that and chapter 8 this the system of God's salvation and and how we've been introduced to a New Covenant the New Covenant of Christ blood that Christ would actually live out his live out this Covenant in our lives and comp comparing that to the Earth Earthly and the Heavenly Tabernacles and and in chapter 10 we're going to get into the life of God's salvation and look in chapter 11 at lives of that the saints that live by a life of Faith because Faith as we know is the evidence the evidence of things hoped for and we'll just stop there God bless you [Applause] Saints for
