[43:45] you appreciate the anointing this
[43:48] morning it's it's good to have church
[43:51] in that's that's what a a Believer Longs
[43:55] for is to is is to be entertained by the
[43:57] word and that's uh there's a lot of
[44:00] things that entertain people today and
[44:02] you you know you can go to ball games
[44:03] and go to different things but uh
[44:05] there's just something about coming to
[44:07] church and getting in that atmosphere
[44:08] and getting in the presence am of God
[44:12] and I want to speak this morning from uh
[44:13] Matthew chapter
[44:15] 24 uh verses TW uh 15 to 28 and and just
[44:20] take a little topic that the elect will
[44:21] not be
[44:25] deceived and
[44:28] and and this you know I y'all know how I
[44:30] preach sometimes I I'll take a sermon
[44:32] that brother Ram preached and use that
[44:33] as the framework and I preached on this
[44:35] sermon a few times before but going to
[44:37] revisit it and and this is the sermon
[44:39] the anointed ones at the end time and
[44:41] brother Brandon would you if you're
[44:42] listen to this he he's actually uh he's
[44:45] really taking things from the seals
[44:48] especially the first seal and exposing
[44:51] it in this sermon and and that's why
[44:53] he'll say things like these things could
[44:55] never have been known until this day in
[44:58] the end time where we can where where
[45:00] our confusion is kind of eliminated
[45:03] where we can see things clearly and
[45:06] see it's it's not a finger point sermon
[45:09] it's a pointing at us to see to see if
[45:11] you're really genuine or not so as we
[45:14] meditate on these things let's go
[45:15] straight into the word in in uh Matthew
[45:18] 24:15 where he says when ye therefore
[45:20] shall see the abomination of desolation
[45:23] spoken of by Daniel the Prophet stand in
[45:25] the Holy Place whoo re let him
[45:27] understand then let him which be in
[45:29] Judea flee into the mountains let him
[45:31] which is on the housetop not come down
[45:33] to take anything out of his house
[45:34] neither let him which is in the field
[45:36] return back to take his clothes and woe
[45:38] unto them that are with child unto them
[45:40] that give suck in those days but pray ye
[45:42] that your flight be not in the winter
[45:44] neither on the Sabbath day for then
[45:46] shall be Great Tribulation such as was
[45:48] not since since the beginning of the
[45:50] world to this time no nor ever shall
[45:53] be and except those days should be
[45:55] shortened there
[45:57] no flesh be saved but for the elect's
[46:00] sake those days shall be shortened then
[46:04] if any man shall say unto you Lo here is
[46:07] Christ or there believe it not now
[46:11] here's The Clincher right here verse 24
[46:13] for there shall arise false christs and
[46:16] false prophets and shall show great
[46:19] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[46:21] were possible they shall deceive the
[46:24] very elect now this is where I'm taking
[46:26] my notes from
[46:27] it it ain't possible and it's not
[46:29] possible to deceive the very late
[46:31] because in this day God has unloaded all
[46:33] of the word am so all of his Spirit can
[46:36] be unloaded on the bride and so that
[46:38] you're not going to be deceived because
[46:39] you are the word and you ain't going to
[46:41] be deceived how can you deceive the word
[46:43] if you become if you become the word as
[46:45] you hear the word so you're not going to
[46:47] be deceived because Christ has revealed
[46:50] in you behold I've told you before
[46:52] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[46:53] behold he is in the desert go not forth
[46:56] behold told he is in the secret Chambers
[46:58] believe it not now now there's a lot to
[47:01] unpack in that that's right amen when
[47:04] they tell
[47:05] you he's over in this city you got to go
[47:08] to this church or you got to go listen
[47:09] to this person come on now brother am
[47:13] right yeah you know where he is amen for
[47:16] as the lightning cometh out of the East
[47:18] and shineth even under the West so shall
[47:20] also the coming of the son of man be for
[47:23] where now here's the other
[47:25] clencher a vulture will hang on to uh
[47:28] dead meat from another day or from by on
[47:30] air but Eagle's got to have fresh meat
[47:33] so you can tell the difference because
[47:34] an eagle is going to have a it's going
[47:37] an eagle is going to believe a present
[47:39] tense word the revealed word for that
[47:41] day which will be manifested in the life
[47:45] of that believer that's why it says for
[47:47] wheresoever the carcass is there will
[47:48] the Eagles be gathered together you may
[47:51] be seated the Lord add his Blessing to
[47:52] the reading of the
[47:54] word you you know uh as I as I meditate
[47:58] on these sermons and things that really
[48:00] just I'm just really impressed upon that
[48:03] I I it makes me think how many people
[48:06] really recognize the the it's like it's
[48:10] like the treasure that we have in our
[48:11] hands The Treasure of this message I I
[48:15] was uh I've got this Bible study
[48:17] software on my computer and I I I I an
[48:20] ad on popped up on Facebook or something
[48:22] for it and that was a denominational
[48:24] Minister talking about I'm I I he's
[48:27] working for this software company that
[48:28] helps you study the Bible and he said
[48:30] I'm trying to help I want to help
[48:33] preachers have something to convey to
[48:36] their congregation and I got thinking
[48:38] about that you know there's a lot of
[48:39] denominational preachers that are kind
[48:41] of struggling with what what you know
[48:43] they're studying things out but they
[48:45] don't really you know they can preach
[48:47] you know the basics of you need Christ
[48:50] and things but but now you know as
[48:53] ministers because of this wealth that
[48:56] we've got we should never struggle for
[48:58] something to say that's right and you
[49:00] know you just take one of these one of
[49:02] these sermons and unpack it and it
[49:04] begins to it begins to give strength and
[49:07] Clarity in a in a confusing hour and and
[49:10] and the whole reason for this message
[49:12] one of the one of the great benefits is
[49:13] that it takes away the confusion where
[49:16] you can see things clearly where you can
[49:19] be able to now we've been kind of lately
[49:21] on discernment to be able to discern
[49:23] true and false and I believe in this
[49:25] hour we should be able to discern true
[49:28] and false because brother R would say
[49:30] he's he's trying to lay out this point
[49:32] that that in this hour it's going to be
[49:34] so close that it's going to be very hard
[49:36] to detect and and I I say these things
[49:39] cuz sometimes you get kind of worried
[49:41] about people's discernment cuz you know
[49:42] people will say like like we use an
[49:44] example of this this political race that
[49:46] just happened I heard somebody the other
[49:48] day they said I'm not getting in
[49:49] politics don't worry but somebody the
[49:51] other day said uh you know I I'm glad
[49:54] speaking of the political candidates I'm
[49:56] glad we have a moral candidate and
[50:00] I I I I got I just kind of it's timing
[50:03] for a little bit I I'm I'm thinking now
[50:05] now look we're in this hour it's going
[50:07] to be so close that even sitting in a
[50:08] message church or sitting right there in
[50:10] the religious Realms it'll be so close
[50:12] that you can't tell and yet we're used
[50:14] to used to 20 or 30 years ago we'd make
[50:17] fun of politics how politicians you
[50:19] can't trust them and you know they I I
[50:22] was reading some stats how when a
[50:23] politician gets in office they'll only
[50:25] meet they only uh
[50:27] fulfill maybe 20% on both sides of the
[50:30] aisle of the promises that they made
[50:32] because you just can't trust a
[50:33] politician so to look at a political
[50:36] race or something and say well that's an
[50:38] example of what I believe a real
[50:39] Christian should be or real real
[50:42] morality real a real example of
[50:44] everything that that I want to be
[50:46] identified with as a Christian well my
[50:48] friends I'm sorry but but come on now
[50:51] that we we got to have more discernment
[50:53] than that if we can't even discern that
[50:55] then how are we going to our own
[50:57] Christian Life how are we going to know
[50:59] whether we're real or whether we're
[51:01] false or or or or hey let's let's or
[51:04] whether our church is real or whether
[51:05] whether what what we're believing is
[51:07] real or false you see we you got to have
[51:10] discernment amen discernment is be just
[51:12] just be able to look at something and
[51:13] say well that that that don't look quite
[51:16] right that that you know a young and I
[51:18] use the example before you you need to
[51:20] have discernment when a when you as a
[51:22] young person you're talking to a
[51:24] boyfriend or a girlfriend and they start
[51:25] talking to you you need to be able to
[51:27] know if they're if if they're genuine or
[51:30] not or if they're just making up some
[51:32] some you know trying to act like they're
[51:35] real and genuine you need to have
[51:36] discernment when as a young person maybe
[51:38] you get a little bit older and you get
[51:40] married and you're trying to find which
[51:41] church to go to you need to have
[51:43] discernment and so the reason why
[51:45] brother random preached these things of
[51:47] the anointed ones at the end time is so
[51:48] that we could be able to tell what's
[51:50] genuine and what's false now now as an
[51:53] example you know you come to you go to a
[51:55] church service and we were in some
[51:57] recently where you know the spirit is
[52:00] moving and I I was talking to some
[52:02] brothers recently about the the the the
[52:04] bethl youth camp where uh they were
[52:05] talking about sitting up there playing
[52:07] their instruments as the spirit rolled
[52:09] through the congregation after the
[52:11] service and and you could actually see
[52:13] just like how brother random used to
[52:14] talk about in his meetings the Holy
[52:16] Spirit would move from this little group
[52:17] from to this little group and the
[52:19] anointing is present in the congregation
[52:22] but one thing you got to realize is the
[52:24] anointing is vindicating itself is
[52:27] proving that God is real and he's there
[52:29] in the church service he's there in the
[52:32] people or moving among the people but it
[52:35] doesn't necessarily vindicate the person
[52:38] you can have and and that's the whole
[52:40] point of this sermon really is that you
[52:41] can have a an anointed preacher an
[52:44] anointed Christian person sitting in the
[52:46] congregation that you can the spirit
[52:48] will be moving and people will be
[52:50] praising God and and and and maybe
[52:52] someone will even speak in tongues or
[52:54] interpret tongues as brother going to go
[52:57] on to explain that he was in that
[52:58] Pentecostal meeting and all of these
[53:00] things can happen but it doesn't
[53:01] necessarily vindicate the person you you
[53:04] got to have some you got to look at
[53:06] something else to vindicate the person
[53:09] God moving in the service and that's
[53:11] what oh that's wonderful when you feel
[53:13] the presence of God and he's moving in
[53:15] the service and maybe you'll even see
[53:16] something Supernatural and some somebody
[53:19] will like one of my family members
[53:21] recently in a in a service just
[53:23] spontaneously the anointing dropped and
[53:25] just shouted praised God and and
[53:27] something begins to move on the hearts
[53:29] and lives of the people in the in the
[53:30] service but it doesn't necessarily
[53:34] vindicate the person that's right now
[53:36] there's the thing amen I've even heard
[53:39] maybe some of you I'm I'mma poke at you
[53:40] a little bit y'all go to a Pentecostal
[53:42] meeting and say Well they're having a
[53:43] Revival over there yeah a a as though
[53:46] you going to say well we ain't having
[53:47] something over here they're having a
[53:49] Revival and you look and and you get all
[53:51] excited about a Pentecostal church
[53:53] service with anointing and my that look
[53:55] at what all going on over there and you
[53:58] fail to realize because you lack
[54:00] discernment you fail to realize the
[54:03] difference what just because God is
[54:06] moving in the service and moving and
[54:08] moving and and and people are are
[54:10] shouting and screaming does not
[54:12] vindicate what people are preaching
[54:14] about it does not vindicate their lives
[54:17] it does not vindicate the person it
[54:19] doesn't vindicate the person behind the
[54:20] pullit if somebody in the church begins
[54:22] to shout and praise God and run up and
[54:24] down the aisle but now the balance of it
[54:26] is is we want that I I want I want
[54:30] Liberty where God somebody feel if they
[54:32] want to run up and down the aisle they
[54:34] have Liberty to do that where where they
[54:36] can praise God and worship in whatever
[54:38] way they want but realizing that that
[54:41] does not vindicate that
[54:45] personall brother R will say I want you
[54:47] to notice here in Matthew 24 Jesus use
[54:50] the term Christ Christ means anointed
[54:54] not Christ but Christ plural not
[54:56] singular Christ therefore the word
[54:58] Christ means the anointed one and then
[55:01] if it's anointed there will not only one
[55:03] but many anointed the anointed ones the
[55:06] anointing the anointing can fall in move
[55:09] in your spirit realm and move and and
[55:12] affect your flesh and move and yet
[55:15] there's something missing on down on the
[55:17] inside something will be different amen
[55:20] now maybe as I'm
[55:21] preaching let's just just ask your
[55:23] question you to keep you from maybe
[55:25] getting bored forward and drawing back
[55:27] do you know the difference right do do
[55:29] you know how to tell the
[55:31] difference do you if cuz if you don't
[55:33] know then listen real
[55:36] good do you know how to tell well you
[55:39] see maybe you see your children go to
[55:41] youth camp or something and they praise
[55:43] God and they would run up and down the
[55:44] aisle I remember my kids praise God when
[55:47] they were uh they they went to Youth
[55:49] Camp and they were talking about how
[55:49] they praise God and they would run up
[55:51] and down the aisle and I remember
[55:52] thinking yeah but there's more
[55:56] that's good that's great that's good so
[56:00] can you can you tell cuz if you can't
[56:03] tell and here's the other thing if you
[56:05] can't tell besides just listening to me
[56:07] now this this should really Inspire us
[56:10] to get to get into the message and go
[56:13] searching through it and read things and
[56:16] and labor through it and I want to put
[56:18] balance to it nobody's going to be able
[56:19] to study like a minister a Minister's
[56:22] got a special gift to get into the word
[56:23] for hours and hours and pray and set
[56:25] their side
[56:26] their life apart but you've got to
[56:29] you've got to have a desire to maybe
[56:31] just listening to it in the background
[56:33] during the day something and and
[56:35] something is going to draw you if
[56:36] there's really something working in your
[56:38] life you're going to be drawn to the
[56:40] word and you're not just going to sit it
[56:42] over to the side while you watch this
[56:44] soap operas or what other the things of
[56:46] this world but there's going to be
[56:47] something in your life that will draw
[56:49] you to the
[56:51] word and that's what I'm trying to
[56:53] promote now here's the thing about a
[56:56] false anointed one there's true anointed
[56:58] ones and there's false anointed ones so
[57:02] we're not trying to get away from the
[57:03] anointing right but we're trying to be
[57:05] genuine amen yes sir I was talking to
[57:07] somebody recently you know we we get so
[57:09] enthused we want to we want to do things
[57:12] and do things for God and and be seen
[57:14] and whatnot but you know the main thing
[57:16] is to be genuine I'd rather be genuine
[57:19] and nobody know me I'd rather be genuine
[57:22] and have like one click on my sermon I'd
[57:25] rather have genuine I you know that that
[57:27] trumps really everything else I'd rather
[57:30] be genuine and real than be an anointed
[57:33] and and be fake on the inside be be a
[57:35] hypocrite fooling everybody I'd rather
[57:37] be genuine than than anything else I'd
[57:41] rather be genuine than be a hypocrite
[57:43] even brother BR said I I'd rather well I
[57:45] I would never want to be a hypocrite and
[57:47] stand before God on that day as a
[57:48] hypocrite I I want to be a real genuine
[57:51] in other words down in my soul be right
[57:56] a false and owned one though they're
[57:58] they're not like you'd say an unbeliever
[58:01] a false and owned one sitting in church
[58:04] going to
[58:05] church celebrating worshiping amen
[58:09] they're they're as far as you look at
[58:10] them on the outside they're a Christian
[58:12] what what does the anointing do it makes
[58:14] you have a desire for lost
[58:16] souls it it will uh you know brother I'm
[58:19] they'd like to worship they like to go
[58:21] to church they like to sing songs they
[58:23] like a good oldfashioned camp meeting
[58:25] but all the time they're they're
[58:27] motivated by Devils now let's take a
[58:31] step back here for a second when you get
[58:33] to preaching like this I know it makes
[58:34] everybody draw up and things because you
[58:36] think the preacher's pointing at you but
[58:38] I'm not talking this morning about the
[58:39] measuring stick of a man sometimes we
[58:42] start looking and we'll think well the
[58:43] the man is going to measure me and out
[58:45] in the parking lot he's going to be
[58:46] pointing his finger at me and saying and
[58:49] you know what happens when you start
[58:50] letting the man measure you what if what
[58:53] if I have a bad day or brother Wade has
[58:55] a bad day at church and and and you go
[58:57] home and you think well brother D
[58:59] brother Wade or brother Bob or who
[59:01] brother Aaron said something to me and
[59:03] you go home and thinking I'm not doing
[59:05] too great as a Christian today because
[59:07] you didn't measure up to what your what
[59:09] that man told you or maybe the man has a
[59:12] good day and and you're thinking wow I'm
[59:14] a really good Christian because that man
[59:16] likes me and that's how we approach
[59:18] Christianity a lot of times we're trying
[59:20] to satisfy The Man Behind the pulpit or
[59:22] we're trying to we're trying to get in
[59:24] good graces with the man but we're not
[59:26] trying to measure up by God's standard
[59:29] we're not following a man we're
[59:30] following Christ so as long as you meet
[59:33] the standard that said in the word that
[59:35] will give you confidence that you're
[59:37] walking and you're doing and you're and
[59:39] you're and you're measuring up right you
[59:41] know like in Zechariah where zerubba
[59:43] will begin to build the temple and and
[59:44] the Bible says he had a plum line Plum
[59:46] line that he's holding up to make sure
[59:48] he's building everything correct that
[59:50] everything's everything's being
[59:51] constructed correctly right and now
[59:54] that's the plum the plum line of God's
[59:56] word is what we got to measure up
[59:58] against not not whether Bob brother Bob
[1:00:00] or brother Wade or brother Aaron or
[1:00:02] brother Louis is happy or any of the
[1:00:03] deacons and nobody's fussing at you it's
[1:00:06] not a man that's that's trying to guide
[1:00:08] your life but it's the Holy Ghost and
[1:00:10] the word is trying to trying to keep us
[1:00:12] walk in the straight and
[1:00:15] eror and you
[1:00:17] know it's so easy it's so you think well
[1:00:20] aren't we walking the straight in there
[1:00:22] aren't we staying right with the word I
[1:00:23] think you know when Paul got to the
[1:00:25] Ephesians church he asked them this
[1:00:27] question have you received the Holy
[1:00:30] Ghost since you believed and they said
[1:00:33] unto him we don't we we had heard
[1:00:34] anything about there being in the Holy
[1:00:35] Ghost and you know you say well that
[1:00:39] that was the Ephesian church but you
[1:00:41] know you really got to be careful that
[1:00:43] that thought will actually creep into
[1:00:45] the message I think it has creeped into
[1:00:47] the message that denominational idea
[1:00:50] that Baptist idea that well as long as
[1:00:52] I'm a message believer I've already got
[1:00:54] the I'm already born again
[1:00:56] as long as I'm sitting in church I'm
[1:00:59] already born again you you know that's
[1:01:01] really the minister struggle to preach
[1:01:03] it to convict somebody so that the veil
[1:01:06] comes off their eyes and they realize
[1:01:07] that they ain't where they're supposed
[1:01:09] to be if we can get away from that
[1:01:11] denomina denominational idea that if you
[1:01:13] sit in a message Church you're born
[1:01:15] again just because you're sitting in a
[1:01:17] message church does not mean you're born
[1:01:19] again just because you're sitting in the
[1:01:21] church and you're nodding your head does
[1:01:22] not mean you're born again you're born
[1:01:24] again when your life matches up with the
[1:01:25] the word says it should be you're born
[1:01:28] again when you're you're actually a
[1:01:30] living expression of what the word for
[1:01:32] your day says you should be now what is
[1:01:35] the
[1:01:36] anointing it's a Divine empowerment by
[1:01:38] the Holy Spirit to fulfill God's will so
[1:01:41] it might be a Divine empowerment for
[1:01:43] preaching I went through all these
[1:01:45] quotes where where brother R was talking
[1:01:46] about anointing and he said there's some
[1:01:48] anointings that will that will move upon
[1:01:50] me to give and to take so there'll be an
[1:01:53] anointing that will drain the energy
[1:01:55] from him and other anointings that will
[1:01:57] just give all the strength to him
[1:01:58] there'll be an anointing for a healing
[1:02:00] service an anointing for preaching and
[1:02:02] different anointings for different
[1:02:04] situations and it's an anointing just
[1:02:06] like the anointing that came on Jesus at
[1:02:08] the River Jordan an anointing he was the
[1:02:11] word born in that M manger is a word but
[1:02:13] the anointing came on him to move him
[1:02:15] right into service and go to preaching
[1:02:17] which is why because the anointing was
[1:02:19] on him he could stand there in the
[1:02:20] temple or stand there in the synagogue
[1:02:22] and reach for that Scroll of Isaiah and
[1:02:24] say the spirit of the Lord is upon me CU
[1:02:27] he was anointed to preach anointed to to
[1:02:30] to to preach a word that was set the
[1:02:32] captive free to to to to heal the
[1:02:35] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:02:37] the captives and recovering of sight to
[1:02:39] the blind you talk about an anointing an
[1:02:42] anointing to set people free an
[1:02:44] anointing to loose loose Deliverance in
[1:02:47] people's lives well I wonder if that
[1:02:49] same kind of anointing could be in this
[1:02:51] day not not because we've got into a
[1:02:54] worked up into an emotion or sensation
[1:02:56] or something but but because we've heard
[1:02:59] the word and we've meditated on it and
[1:03:02] received it amen he said the anointing
[1:03:03] of the Holy Ghost that has nothing to do
[1:03:05] with the soul inside you you can speak
[1:03:09] in tongues and deny the word you got to
[1:03:11] line up with the truth of the word right
[1:03:14] so what is Anointed anointed one is one
[1:03:16] with a message
[1:03:19] yep and he would even say the only way
[1:03:21] the message can be brought out is by one
[1:03:23] that's anointed in other words human
[1:03:25] effort Al isn't sufficient you you know
[1:03:27] you turn on the uh if turn on the
[1:03:30] YouTube or whatever and watch some of
[1:03:32] these preachers out in the
[1:03:34] denominational world and you better
[1:03:35] believe they're anointed they're they're
[1:03:38] anointed and they're preaching the
[1:03:39] gospel and and some of them have some
[1:03:41] pretty good sermons and they'll they'll
[1:03:43] bring they'll break out some things
[1:03:45] about family life and live it and how to
[1:03:47] find a good spouse and and make
[1:03:49] everybody laugh and and everybody be
[1:03:51] sharing what they said on Facebook and
[1:03:53] all of those kind of things and they're
[1:03:54] anointed cuz the only way the message
[1:03:57] can be brought out is by one that's
[1:03:58] anointed but but what about what
[1:04:00] vindicates that person on the inside are
[1:04:03] they are they in the rhythm of the word
[1:04:05] for their day are they believing the
[1:04:08] message of this day are they are they
[1:04:10] are is their life lying up with the what
[1:04:12] with what the Bible says they should be
[1:04:14] living in this day
[1:04:17] amen it's the anointing that
[1:04:19] distinguishes between merely just
[1:04:20] speaking religious words and speaking
[1:04:23] with spiritual power that's why brother
[1:04:24] R said and what was the Holy Ghost given
[1:04:26] for he said the Holy Ghost is given to
[1:04:28] to to an unction to the preacher it will
[1:04:30] transform a service where it it's not
[1:04:33] just a man speaking up there but it's
[1:04:34] the Holy Ghost putting the words
[1:04:36] together but it might be the Holy Ghost
[1:04:38] putting some words together but that
[1:04:39] doesn't yet vindicate the person
[1:04:41] speaking cuz they could speak something
[1:04:43] in error now now there's where the
[1:04:45] confusion is that you could be speaking
[1:04:48] something in error and preaching
[1:04:50] something wrong and yet be genuinely
[1:04:54] anointed by the Holy Ghost
[1:04:57] you could be sitting in a a holy
[1:04:59] anointed Holy Ghost filled church
[1:05:01] service wow they're having a Revival and
[1:05:04] it' be wrong and it be wrong right
[1:05:07] brother without the anointing the
[1:05:09] message won't have its intended
[1:05:10] spiritual impact the anointing is what
[1:05:14] makes the message penetrate hearts and
[1:05:16] Minds I I've listened to anointed
[1:05:18] preachers before and I I thought wow
[1:05:21] they are they are a good speaker they
[1:05:24] can just roll them words words off their
[1:05:26] tongue and and and and and really an
[1:05:28] anointed speaker you you could you could
[1:05:31] could make somebody uh buy a car that's
[1:05:35] falling
[1:05:36] apart an anointed speaker could could
[1:05:39] pull somebody over to some idea that
[1:05:42] that often left field an anointed
[1:05:45] speaker could sway your heart and mind
[1:05:47] to to vote for the wrong thing at a
[1:05:50] political election or to do whatever an
[1:05:53] anointing speak why it's an anointing
[1:05:55] but it doesn't vindicate that
[1:05:58] person in other words the Holy Ghost can
[1:06:01] be present and moving and active and
[1:06:03] empowering but the person and their
[1:06:06] message be false yes sir now that's what
[1:06:08] brother that's what brother Paul that's
[1:06:11] what brother Paul was saying in 1
[1:06:12] Corinthians 13 if you go back and read
[1:06:14] that maybe write that down to go back
[1:06:17] and and really digest later on cuz what
[1:06:20] what I'm kind of getting at is is you
[1:06:22] you will move on not by emotion and
[1:06:24] sensation by by by slow diligent
[1:06:28] meditation on God's word so you go and
[1:06:31] open up 1 Corinthians 13 and read
[1:06:34] through it slow what is this talking
[1:06:36] about what what what don't don't just
[1:06:39] leave it at church but at home maybe
[1:06:41] when you're drinking your coffee in the
[1:06:43] morning open up that scripture and think
[1:06:45] about it think about that scripture
[1:06:47] earlier I read Paul say and though I
[1:06:50] speak with the tongues of men and of
[1:06:52] angels and have not
[1:06:53] charity though I though I'm in a church
[1:06:55] service and I speak in tongues in other
[1:06:58] tongues and of I speak in the tongue of
[1:07:01] angels but I don't have charity but I
[1:07:04] don't have the real regenerated life I
[1:07:08] it's just like sounding brass or
[1:07:10] tinkling sbol go that stimle and Clank
[1:07:12] on it it it's just like noise just
[1:07:16] clanking and though I have the gift of
[1:07:18] Prophecy wow that's what everybody get
[1:07:21] wow he got a real he got a real gift but
[1:07:24] it doesn't vindicate the person person
[1:07:25] right and understand all Mysteries now
[1:07:30] that's a quote I'm going to take from
[1:07:31] Brother Dale brother Dale said that you
[1:07:32] could understand the symbolics of all
[1:07:34] the Seven Seals and still not see what
[1:07:37] the real mystery of the seven Thunders
[1:07:38] is because you understand it by an
[1:07:41] intellectual understanding and you
[1:07:42] repeat you can repeat like a parrot what
[1:07:45] somebody else said that's what brother
[1:07:47] brother Dale said when he was preaching
[1:07:48] the message on the seven Thunders that
[1:07:50] you can understand all the Mysteries but
[1:07:53] you're still not born again that's right
[1:07:56] you can have all knowledge you can lay
[1:07:58] it out and and have all the structure
[1:08:00] and all the framework and and still not
[1:08:02] be right on the inside and though I have
[1:08:05] all Faith so that I could remove
[1:08:07] mountains and have not charity I am
[1:08:08] nothing and though I bestow all my goods
[1:08:11] a lot of works that I could go into the
[1:08:13] soup kitchen and work I can do all these
[1:08:16] things to feed the poor and though I get
[1:08:18] my body to be burned and have not
[1:08:20] charity it profiteth me nothing amen now
[1:08:23] look how Paul begins to
[1:08:26] identify the fruits of Charity charity
[1:08:29] suffers long and is
[1:08:32] kind kind I don't like
[1:08:35] kindness charity envieth not why CU it
[1:08:39] it's not looking at a man for validation
[1:08:42] it's not looking at as long as I go to
[1:08:44] certain church or I sit under a certain
[1:08:45] pull pit then I know I'm right no
[1:08:47] charity charity knows it's got an inward
[1:08:50] peace it knows where it stand it knows
[1:08:53] what it's standing for charity vaunteth
[1:08:55] not itself it doesn't matter whe charity
[1:08:57] doesn't matter whether it's in a Manger
[1:08:59] or on the on the backs side of a desert
[1:09:01] or wherever it's not puffed up it do
[1:09:04] does not behave itself unseemly it
[1:09:07] seeketh not her own it's not trying to
[1:09:09] put itself up or something it's not
[1:09:10] easily provoked it you know you you can
[1:09:13] poke at it so well I don't like your
[1:09:15] family I don't like the way you live I
[1:09:17] don't you you message you Pentecostal
[1:09:19] believer it well it's all right we just
[1:09:23] keep going on thinketh no evil rejoiceth
[1:09:26] not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the
[1:09:28] truth beareth all things believeth all
[1:09:32] things hopeth all things endureth all
[1:09:37] things now what brother Ram said about
[1:09:39] that scripture he said remember you can
[1:09:41] speak in genuine the Holy Ghost tongues
[1:09:43] and still not have the Holy Ghost right
[1:09:46] the Bible said so though I speak with
[1:09:49] tongue of men and angels and have not
[1:09:52] charity it prth it profit me nothing
[1:09:55] amen so what you can preach contrary to
[1:09:58] God's word and be anointed yep sure you
[1:10:01] can focus on signs and wonders because
[1:10:04] you're anointed and be wrong on the
[1:10:06] inside you can misinterpret present day
[1:10:09] truth and be wrong amen you can produce
[1:10:13] false fruits or preach a historical
[1:10:16] interpretation a false a false Believer
[1:10:19] cannot stay with the word because their
[1:10:21] word their life is not based on the word
[1:10:23] they're not looking at the word they're
[1:10:25] looking at it's something else or
[1:10:26] they'll manipulate scripture and boy
[1:10:29] that's a that's a big one to manipulate
[1:10:31] scripture to fit your own kns and your
[1:10:33] own goals just slide it around so that
[1:10:36] it means what you want it to mean that's
[1:10:38] right he said what were they Janice and
[1:10:40] jamb balum all them what were they
[1:10:42] Christ anointed Christ and false
[1:10:45] prophets anointed ones but Pro false
[1:10:49] prophets Jesus said that the rain falls
[1:10:52] on the just and the unjust amen you know
[1:10:55] one thing that I love he said what's the
[1:10:57] rain for the rain the rain will fall on
[1:10:59] the the false and the true it fall on
[1:11:01] the nettle and the wheat it'll fall on
[1:11:04] the on on the tears and everything but
[1:11:06] what the rain fent for is the wheat now
[1:11:08] what I can take away from that for this
[1:11:10] morning is God wants that rain to fall
[1:11:12] on you that's that rain is for you if
[1:11:14] you need a blessing a good oldfashioned
[1:11:16] Pentecostal blessing that'll make you
[1:11:18] run and Shout this morning then that
[1:11:20] rain is for you it's it's it's it's it's
[1:11:22] coming for you and that rain that rain
[1:11:24] will make both of them grow up to
[1:11:27] fulfill their
[1:11:28] potential something something that's
[1:11:30] false or grow up praising God and
[1:11:32] rejoicing in their Spirit now you know a
[1:11:34] lot a lot of way sometimes preachers
[1:11:36] will preach like we want to get rid of
[1:11:38] all the anointed ones and I ain't
[1:11:40] preaching like that this morning I I
[1:11:42] don't want the anointed ones to leave
[1:11:43] the building I don't want them to go
[1:11:45] down the street I want the anointed ones
[1:11:47] to sit around you might as well if this
[1:11:48] is the only blessing you're ever going
[1:11:49] to get you might as well get a good
[1:11:51] blessing and rejoice and be happy and
[1:11:54] sit around and stay while and maybe God
[1:11:56] something God will get a hold of you and
[1:11:57] begin to change change your nature from
[1:12:00] something that's fake to something
[1:12:02] that's genuine and you know how you want
[1:12:04] to be genuine this morning is is let the
[1:12:06] word grab a hold of your life and
[1:12:09] meditate upon the word day and night
[1:12:12] meditate on the word and think about
[1:12:14] God's promises to you oh I love a good
[1:12:18] emotion I love good shout and everything
[1:12:20] but just to get a real sober look at
[1:12:23] God's promises and begin to think about
[1:12:25] that and let it resonate in my heart and
[1:12:27] in my life and think think that these
[1:12:30] promises are for you think that this
[1:12:32] rain that God sent is for you think and
[1:12:36] then when you pray when you get on your
[1:12:38] knees you begin to think about these
[1:12:40] things and it'll affect your
[1:12:41] conversation with god it'll affect your
[1:12:44] your time with God it'll affect your
[1:12:46] relationships with your family it'll
[1:12:48] affect everything and that's why brother
[1:12:50] Ram said by their fruits ye shall know
[1:12:54] them because the word begins to change
[1:12:57] you it's the word I love a good
[1:13:00] emotionalism I love I listen I love
[1:13:03] going in we went to this uh youth youth
[1:13:06] camp uh many years ago and we we come
[1:13:10] out of that service and I that anointing
[1:13:13] was so strong I could not even get out
[1:13:15] of the car I remember Joe come out he
[1:13:18] was with us and he said he he said
[1:13:20] Monica where where's Bob at she's like
[1:13:22] he he's stuck in the car praising God
[1:13:25] and he come out there and sit with me
[1:13:26] for a while and listen I I love a good
[1:13:29] emotional time where you can just praise
[1:13:31] God and worship worship on the way to
[1:13:33] work but there's a difference when you
[1:13:36] get a hold of the word the word is what
[1:13:40] will anchor you the word is what will
[1:13:42] change you the word will make that
[1:13:44] emotionalism do something instead of
[1:13:47] producing something fake it'll be a real
[1:13:49] genuine anointed son and you know you
[1:13:52] there's got to be an anoint anointing in
[1:13:54] this day the bride is growing up to a
[1:13:56] super anointing a super anointing that
[1:13:58] will that will raise the Dead from the
[1:14:00] ground where that word that we have held
[1:14:03] for all these years is Anointed and put
[1:14:06] into an action into in a super way to
[1:14:08] bring a brother Ram called it a super
[1:14:10] Faith a super anointing there when he
[1:14:13] was talking to Hatty ride in that room
[1:14:14] he said a super anointing came in the
[1:14:16] room a super anointing will anoint the
[1:14:19] super word the perfect word that we've
[1:14:21] heard and put it into action by their
[1:14:24] fruit she shall know there there you are
[1:14:26] what what are your
[1:14:28] fruits the fruits are the observable
[1:14:32] deeds and
[1:14:33] character that manifest in a person's
[1:14:36] life as a result of what is within their
[1:14:39] heart
[1:14:41] right in essence their life will
[1:14:45] consistently produce behaviors and
[1:14:48] attitudes aligned with God's word amen
[1:14:52] and the Bible calls that good fruit yeah
[1:14:55] you're you're connected to the good tree
[1:14:58] the good Vine and that produces good
[1:15:00] fruit if someone is disconnected from
[1:15:04] God tied into that corrupt tree their
[1:15:07] life will bear negative traits or
[1:15:10] actions so you can see here that that
[1:15:13] I'm I'm really laying it down almost
[1:15:15] like
[1:15:16] a like using logic or something but
[1:15:20] there's two things that go into what the
[1:15:22] fruits really is it's the
[1:15:25] Doctrine and the correct
[1:15:28] characteristics the correct Doctrine and
[1:15:30] the revelation will produce a change in
[1:15:34] your life so you can look at somebody
[1:15:36] running and praising God maybe a young
[1:15:38] person at a camp meeting and then they
[1:15:40] go out and they go right back to the
[1:15:42] world looking at stuff on the internet
[1:15:44] they go right back they don't care they
[1:15:46] care more about Facebook and Tik Tok
[1:15:48] than the word give them time I'm not
[1:15:50] poking at you give them time let let but
[1:15:52] one day one day that word word will grab
[1:15:55] a hold of their heart and begin to draw
[1:15:58] them and despite the fact that they
[1:16:00] praised God years ago and nothing
[1:16:02] happened when that word begins to draw
[1:16:03] at their heart it begins to change them
[1:16:06] now there's the difference there's the
[1:16:08] difference the word the word is what
[1:16:10] change changes everything yeah so we
[1:16:13] could we could almost frame it we say it
[1:16:15] like this that you're positioned you're
[1:16:17] position you're never going to get
[1:16:19] Victory by praying and fasting right
[1:16:22] because your Victory and you're overcome
[1:16:24] coming and your placing comes by
[1:16:27] meditation on and consumption of the
[1:16:30] word of God right now there's been a lot
[1:16:32] of people Benny hen and different ones
[1:16:34] that will go and pray I I was listening
[1:16:37] to uh an example of a this brother that
[1:16:40] followed brother Brandon's Ministry but
[1:16:42] never quite believed it and I'm
[1:16:44] forgetting his name right now but he
[1:16:46] said I wanted a Healing Ministry like
[1:16:49] his there's a testimony that you can
[1:16:52] watch on Facebook and and he said I went
[1:16:55] and began to pray to God that he would
[1:16:57] give me a Healing Ministry like brother
[1:16:59] Brams and God did he would go and and
[1:17:04] have prayer lines and people would come
[1:17:06] through and be healed of everything and
[1:17:08] he was anointed God gave him an
[1:17:10] anointing to heal and and so that
[1:17:13] people's lives would be changed in that
[1:17:15] manner but yet he never came to the real
[1:17:18] knowledge of the truth now see you can
[1:17:21] pray and you can fast and those things
[1:17:25] let me put it like this if you want to
[1:17:27] go up it's the word if you want to go
[1:17:31] out it's prayer and fasting up you go up
[1:17:35] by meditation on the word and
[1:17:37] consumption of the word but if you want
[1:17:39] to put it in action that's when you pray
[1:17:42] so you can't we don't want to get away
[1:17:44] from praying and fasting you don't want
[1:17:47] to like somebody years ago told me you
[1:17:49] shouldn't even encourage people to pray
[1:17:51] because prayer never did nothing for me
[1:17:54] well listen it did something for my
[1:17:55] family when I see my children going out
[1:17:58] and doing stuff and I get so many times
[1:18:01] Miracles I can tell about where
[1:18:03] something would be happening and I'd get
[1:18:04] on my knees in prayer believing that God
[1:18:08] would come on the scene and he would
[1:18:09] move what was it it's putting into
[1:18:12] action what I believe but you'll never
[1:18:14] go up you'll never be placed by prayer
[1:18:17] and fasting it's the word of God but
[1:18:19] when you're placed and when you're put
[1:18:21] into action then you can put that to
[1:18:23] work by prayer and fasting what does
[1:18:26] fasting do is setting your life laying
[1:18:28] your your your own being aside so that
[1:18:31] you can be better align to believe God's
[1:18:34] word you like sometimes ministers will
[1:18:36] not not eat before they preach because
[1:18:39] they want to be able to think and allow
[1:18:41] God to use them more in that mode but
[1:18:43] you're never going to be born again and
[1:18:45] you're never going to be adopted because
[1:18:47] you get into an emotional state it's by
[1:18:50] the word of God you'll find out that
[1:18:52] that little little Mary that brother
[1:18:54] said that when when she met the Angel
[1:18:56] when she ran into the angel she was
[1:18:58] meditating on the scripture that a
[1:19:01] virgin shall conceive and you think
[1:19:03] about a little a little woman turning
[1:19:05] the corner thinking about God said that
[1:19:08] a woman a virgin shall conceive and she
[1:19:12] turned the corner meditating on that
[1:19:14] scripture and there was the angel
[1:19:16] waiting on her so if you want to meet an
[1:19:18] angel if you want to have God come
[1:19:20] himself and reveal something to you get
[1:19:22] to meditating on the word now there I I
[1:19:25] want to say that's what Lula's problem
[1:19:27] is is we're relying on The Man Behind
[1:19:29] the pulpit instead of having our own
[1:19:32] personal relationship with God we're
[1:19:34] relying on somebody else to do the heavy
[1:19:37] lifting for us where when something goes
[1:19:39] wrong with our family we want to have
[1:19:41] somebody to blame somebody to point our
[1:19:44] fingers at and say well like I've
[1:19:45] actually heard nobody was praying for my
[1:19:48] child will you get on your own knees and
[1:19:51] pray for your child yourself I did it
[1:19:53] from my you do it for yours you pray for
[1:19:56] your child if you've got a real token
[1:19:59] life a token Holy Ghost life hold that
[1:20:01] token over your family and see God go to
[1:20:05] work oh if the word changes your heart
[1:20:09] then you can put it into action by
[1:20:11] prayer amen but look look we don't want
[1:20:13] to do away with prayer we don't want to
[1:20:16] do away with fasting we don't want to do
[1:20:19] away with an anointing that's where it's
[1:20:21] been so hard over the years to keep a
[1:20:24] balance
[1:20:25] because you people begin to run and
[1:20:27] shout and praise God and and they start
[1:20:29] looking at that instead of the word but
[1:20:32] oh if we can express it right if we can
[1:20:34] speak it right it's the word that will
[1:20:36] bring you faith and put you into
[1:20:38] position but then you can put it into
[1:20:40] action with your life with your living
[1:20:42] and your prayer and your
[1:20:44] confession you the Bible says that we're
[1:20:47] saved by our confession and when you get
[1:20:48] on your knees and start confessing what
[1:20:50] God already said something that goes
[1:20:52] into action because you're not you're
[1:20:53] not praying like like a Buddhist or a
[1:20:55] Hindu that's just getting emotional
[1:20:57] we're going to pray three times a day
[1:20:59] and put our towel out and all those kind
[1:21:01] of things but you're praying based on
[1:21:03] your revelation of the word of God and
[1:21:06] the word of God is what will get things
[1:21:10] moving the anointing proves God's
[1:21:13] presence in activity but the fruit
[1:21:15] vindicates the person yes
[1:21:18] sir now that's why I I love a good old
[1:21:20] Pentecostal service where the anointing
[1:21:23] gets to moving and you can see that God
[1:21:25] is in
[1:21:28] action but the fruit vindicates the
[1:21:30] person I I was in a a a a a meeting a
[1:21:33] few years ago it was that camp meeting
[1:21:36] in and well I'm not going to say it cuz
[1:21:37] I'm I might get in trouble but I I was
[1:21:40] watching you know Zach had just had a
[1:21:43] real experience with God and he was
[1:21:44] running up and down the aisles he was
[1:21:47] praising God and I looked over on this
[1:21:49] other side and you could see people
[1:21:51] praising God that I'm sorry but I was
[1:21:54] just like I don't know if that's genuine
[1:21:57] and you know they're doing you know and
[1:22:00] I'm not trying to poke or nothing but
[1:22:02] listen you can tell just because someone
[1:22:05] is jumping and shouting does not mean
[1:22:08] that it's genuine you can get into an
[1:22:10] atmosphere like that and just get worked
[1:22:11] up or whatnot but it's the fruit the
[1:22:14] fruit that vindicates the person
[1:22:18] amen and brother R in that sermon now
[1:22:21] this is where this is where it helps to
[1:22:23] meditate
[1:22:25] meditate go through a sermon and think
[1:22:28] paragraph by paragraph get to one of
[1:22:30] these paragraphs and start thinking what
[1:22:33] is he trying to say and he said the
[1:22:36] spirit of God here's the fruits always
[1:22:40] is ready for correction right now you
[1:22:43] know now that don't it's your it's your
[1:22:45] characteristics have been changed that
[1:22:47] doesn't mean that when a preacher is
[1:22:48] preaching from behind the pull pit that
[1:22:50] you don't bow up that means in any
[1:22:52] situation somebody can Co up to you and
[1:22:54] say there here's the big one that we bow
[1:22:56] up at I think you're
[1:22:58] mean yeah
[1:23:02] what I I I don't like you talking to me
[1:23:04] like
[1:23:07] that the spirit of God always is ready
[1:23:10] for correction why can't we have normal
[1:23:13] discussions with one another where we
[1:23:15] can talk about things and talk things
[1:23:17] over the spirit of God always is ready
[1:23:20] for correction sweet and humble uhuh I
[1:23:24] don't like
[1:23:26] that that's good that's good we're
[1:23:29] getting somewhere if we if we Rec
[1:23:31] recognize there something lacking in our
[1:23:33] life then we'll start to get serious
[1:23:36] with God now remember what I was
[1:23:38] preaching on a while back it's when it's
[1:23:39] the life that attracts you to the gospel
[1:23:42] but the way you're going to get to the
[1:23:43] life is through the word because Jesus
[1:23:45] said my words are spirit and they are
[1:23:47] life so the life makes I I want to be
[1:23:50] sweet and humble I don't want to be
[1:23:53] orary and me mean and hateful I want my
[1:23:56] life and my characteristics to be
[1:23:58] changed cuz brother R brother Ram said
[1:24:00] how are you going to be a witness and a
[1:24:02] testimony if your fruit is all cankered
[1:24:05] up and you might have all the doctrine
[1:24:07] laid out nice and neat but your attitude
[1:24:09] and your characteristics are just so
[1:24:11] off-putting that nobody can stand to be
[1:24:13] around you now that's where this fruit
[1:24:15] is both the doctrine and the character
[1:24:19] it's the doctrine and the
[1:24:21] characteristics a sweet humble life
[1:24:24] ready for correction ready to ready to
[1:24:27] hear somebody out well I don't think
[1:24:29] they believe like I do but let me talk
[1:24:31] to them let me listen and brother R said
[1:24:34] willing willing willing to get at the
[1:24:37] table and talk talk it over he see he
[1:24:39] said if it's stands up and say I'll do
[1:24:41] it anyhow I I'm going to do it anyhow
[1:24:44] you lay that word out to them and and
[1:24:46] there just something in it something
[1:24:47] that's wrong inside oh I'm going to do
[1:24:49] it anyhow I don't care just remember he
[1:24:52] said arrogant spirit
[1:24:55] are not of God
[1:24:59] right I remember the Bible said he said
[1:25:03] he'd come in like just as Sly as he
[1:25:05] could be and deceive the very elected if
[1:25:08] possible why is it deceiving because an
[1:25:12] anointed preacher can preach and have an
[1:25:15] anointed prayer line at the end of the
[1:25:17] service and people will be running and
[1:25:19] shouting but be leading to the wrong
[1:25:22] thing so you got to listen what to the
[1:25:24] word that's being
[1:25:26] preached but I thank God for the rain
[1:25:29] amen there's that scripture in Hebrews
[1:25:31] chapter 6 it said the Earth which
[1:25:33] drinken in the rain that cometh of upon
[1:25:35] it and bringeth forth herbs meat for
[1:25:37] them by whom it is dressed receiveth
[1:25:40] blessing from God but that which beareth
[1:25:42] thorns and briers is rejected and is
[1:25:44] nigh and cursing whose end is to be
[1:25:46] burned
[1:25:48] amen so both thorns and briers
[1:25:51] everything is being rained on yep it's
[1:25:54] it's the rain the rain that causes
[1:25:56] things to happen the the rain actually
[1:25:59] be make it'll it'll make a young person
[1:26:01] or somebody that's an unbeliever begin
[1:26:02] to realize that there's actually
[1:26:04] something Supernatural taking place in
[1:26:06] here now that's why you you know you go
[1:26:09] over to the third seal and brother
[1:26:10] randam begins to talk he gets to that
[1:26:12] place in the third seal where he said
[1:26:14] notice here's the good part now now I I
[1:26:18] I think we all ought to listen when when
[1:26:20] a prophet of God said here's the good
[1:26:22] part and the good part he talking about
[1:26:25] is the rain and he said he said the lamb
[1:26:28] actually spoke from the throne he said
[1:26:30] it wasn't a beast this time but it was
[1:26:32] the lamb that spoke from the throne and
[1:26:34] said notice see that thou hurt not this
[1:26:37] oil and wine just a little bit of it
[1:26:39] left brother don't you touch that he
[1:26:41] said I'll give you a few verses and what
[1:26:43] he goes on and he says oil typifies the
[1:26:46] spirit so now oil typify spirit and wine
[1:26:50] symbolizes stimulation of Revelation he
[1:26:53] said boy I like to run all over the
[1:26:56] place so in other words the lamb
[1:26:58] actually spoke from the throne you got
[1:27:00] to protect that protect that running all
[1:27:03] over the place protect getting excited
[1:27:06] about a real Revel what is it it's it's
[1:27:08] you're not getting excited over like a
[1:27:10] Buddhist or a Hindu or something
[1:27:11] emotionalism but you're getting excited
[1:27:14] over a revelation of the word of God and
[1:27:17] that is what stimulates you I can you
[1:27:21] think of anything more stimulating than
[1:27:23] to realize that all of your sins are in
[1:27:25] the sea of forgetfulness can you re
[1:27:28] recognize anything more stimulating than
[1:27:30] to realize that your sins are gone and
[1:27:32] you're spotless as the lamb that you got
[1:27:35] a lamb that has paid the price and made
[1:27:37] a way for you to look in the book or to
[1:27:39] think like John standing there how can I
[1:27:41] look at this book I'm not worthy and no
[1:27:43] man is worthy but God gave a lamb to
[1:27:46] make a way for and all that'll stimulate
[1:27:48] anybody to realize that God made a way
[1:27:51] for me to have rapturing faith
[1:27:55] it wasn't the Beast that said hurt not
[1:27:56] the oil and the wine it was the lamb and
[1:27:59] what he was saying is don't hurt that
[1:28:01] spirit that moves through the church
[1:28:03] don't hurt that spirit that where you
[1:28:05] begin to you begin to shout and begin to
[1:28:08] Rejoice over what God is doing don't
[1:28:10] quench that and you you you begin to
[1:28:12] realize that oil and wine always go
[1:28:15] together when you got a real genuine
[1:28:18] Revelation it'll make you do something
[1:28:21] it'll make you hop around it'll make you
[1:28:23] cry it'll make you want to shout because
[1:28:25] you see what God has what God has
[1:28:28] promised you you see the benefits
[1:28:30] available to you you see what God has
[1:28:32] done for you you see he come down
[1:28:34] himself with a shout and a voice and a
[1:28:36] trump and he's the one that did it he
[1:28:40] said when the truth of a promised word
[1:28:42] of God has been truly revealed to his
[1:28:44] Saints that's filled with oil they all
[1:28:47] get stimulated wine is a stimulation
[1:28:50] Glory I feel it now stimulated with joy
[1:28:53] Shout
[1:28:54] and when it does it has the same effect
[1:28:57] upon them that wine does upon a natural
[1:28:59] man because when the Revelation has been
[1:29:01] given of a truth of God and the True
[1:29:03] Believer filled with oil and the
[1:29:05] Revelation is revealed the stimulation
[1:29:08] becomes so great that it makes him
[1:29:11] behave himself
[1:29:13] abnormally right now the lamb spoke from
[1:29:16] the throne protect that it wasn't the
[1:29:19] Beast that said it was the lamb
[1:29:24] thank God for that new wine Amen to make
[1:29:26] a man so drunk on the spirit of God on
[1:29:29] the anointing that he can love somebody
[1:29:31] that hates
[1:29:32] him thank God for that new wine that
[1:29:35] could make a man so drunk until he can
[1:29:38] rejoice and not care what anybody else
[1:29:41] thinks about it where he can live a real
[1:29:43] Godly life Des spite of what the world
[1:29:45] says you know Paul's the one that said
[1:29:47] he called us peculiar y'all peculiar
[1:29:49] people peculiar why because it makes you
[1:29:52] act different it makes you live
[1:29:53] different it makes you walk different
[1:29:55] and talk different brother BR is the one
[1:29:56] that said y'all odd boss odd boss CU why
[1:29:59] we got a different kind of fun we we
[1:30:02] don't have to smoke and drink and and
[1:30:05] and and and do all those worldly things
[1:30:08] to have fun I tell you what a real
[1:30:10] Christ Holy Ghost filled Christian
[1:30:12] that's been filled with that new
[1:30:14] wine they're going to want to come to
[1:30:16] church and be around the word of
[1:30:19] God that's what we come to church for we
[1:30:21] don't come to church just to look at the
[1:30:23] preacher our arms crossed and folded
[1:30:25] with a scowl on our face but we come to
[1:30:27] church to worship cuz that's what the
[1:30:29] lamb spoke from the throne don't quench
[1:30:31] the spirit of God moving in the church
[1:30:34] don't quit that don't quit a real Holy
[1:30:37] Ghost F believer that knows what they
[1:30:39] believe to praise and worship
[1:30:42] amen oh I'm so glad I've got Jesus I
[1:30:45] ain't got the world but I've got
[1:30:48] Jesus and the third seal what does the
[1:30:50] third seal reveal that there's a
[1:30:51] difference there's a difference between
[1:30:54] the
[1:30:55] manipulation of religion that's
[1:30:57] represented by measuring out wheat
[1:30:59] barley and life at a cost with the true
[1:31:02] joy and freedom in the spirit that's
[1:31:05] symbolized by wine and oil of True
[1:31:08] Believers amen most people are measured
[1:31:11] and restricted now that's why I you know
[1:31:14] we don't want to limit in any way the
[1:31:17] move of the spirit in the church most
[1:31:21] people are measured and restricted by
[1:31:23] Earth Earthly and institutional
[1:31:25] constraints but God's anointed ones
[1:31:28] these true anointed ones remain
[1:31:31] spiritually free and Untouchable amen by
[1:31:35] this denominational system oh it's
[1:31:37] Freedom what is it it's that it's that
[1:31:39] wine it's the wine at the marriage
[1:31:41] supper that's why Jesus went to the
[1:31:42] marriage and turned the wine which
[1:31:44] brother R said was a type of the Rapture
[1:31:46] to change the nature of those grapes
[1:31:48] straight over into wine without any kind
[1:31:50] of a process and it's the wine at our
[1:31:52] marriage was turning the wine at that
[1:31:55] marriage but this is the new wine at our
[1:31:57] marriage but why cuz he saved the best
[1:31:59] for last and you know Revelation is
[1:32:03] built to stimulate the bride but all
[1:32:05] that denominational tradition and
[1:32:07] everything will bind will will kill the
[1:32:10] effect of Revelation but Revelation is
[1:32:13] built to stimulate the bride
[1:32:16] amen and that's why I'm not such a big
[1:32:18] fan of
[1:32:19] tradition you just got to keep moving on
[1:32:22] tradition is all the washing pots and
[1:32:24] doing things well we've always done it
[1:32:26] this way we've all we can't change we
[1:32:28] we've always done it that way and God
[1:32:30] just keeps moving right on the
[1:32:32] denomination of the world we can't we
[1:32:34] can't change we've always done it like
[1:32:35] this we've always we we've always had
[1:32:38] our our baptismal pot in the middle of
[1:32:41] the aisle like that church we we can't
[1:32:43] change we've we've always done it like
[1:32:45] this but revelation will stimulate the
[1:32:47] bride into action and get to
[1:32:50] moving and this message will produce an
[1:32:52] anointing all right amen what what how
[1:32:55] does this anointing
[1:32:57] come by thinking think about God's word
[1:33:01] amen just get in that in get in your
[1:33:04] little prayer closet sometime amen I
[1:33:06] remember brother Lis interviewed a
[1:33:08] brother I'm not going to call his name
[1:33:09] out but he was talking to him about how
[1:33:10] do you he was asking him how do you pray
[1:33:13] and he said well I'm I'm a little bit
[1:33:15] odd the brother said this he said I go
[1:33:18] into my closet and I just shut the door
[1:33:20] and I turn the light off and I just
[1:33:22] begin to think about God's
[1:33:25] word then that that might be a different
[1:33:27] approach that you hadn't tried before
[1:33:30] when you when you pray but just go into
[1:33:32] your prayer closet and think about what
[1:33:34] God Said or maybe an alternative way is
[1:33:38] is get your message book open and just
[1:33:41] slowly or your Bible slowly start going
[1:33:44] through and read one verse at a time and
[1:33:47] and sit on it and think what what does
[1:33:49] this mean and as you sit and think and
[1:33:53] digest and hold it in your heart then
[1:33:56] that's when God can come on the scene
[1:33:58] just like he did to Mary who was
[1:34:00] meditating on that scripture a virgin
[1:34:01] shall conceive and God will come on the
[1:34:04] scene and he will he will begin to put
[1:34:06] the pieces together well you read this
[1:34:09] uh uh maybe a year ago and now that goes
[1:34:12] with this and you thought this wasn't
[1:34:14] connected but now it's coming together
[1:34:16] and now the picture is connected and and
[1:34:18] I'm saying it like this because it is a
[1:34:20] requirement you cannot depend on the
[1:34:23] preacher you must have your own
[1:34:25] relationship with God you must know for
[1:34:30] yourself that the fruits can be
[1:34:32] manifested in your life right what's the
[1:34:35] fruit the
[1:34:36] dynamic
[1:34:38] expression of the
[1:34:40] mechanics that you have heard amen the
[1:34:43] fruit is the dynamic expression of the
[1:34:47] mechanics so the mechanics might be like
[1:34:50] you you know you you go chop up a lot of
[1:34:52] firewood and you got it all stacked
[1:34:54] that's the mechanics y but then you
[1:34:56] throw a match into it boom the mechanics
[1:34:59] turns into the
[1:35:02] Dynamics right now that's where we get
[1:35:04] confused a lot of times we think well
[1:35:05] the Dynamics and the mechanics are
[1:35:07] separate you got to have the mechanics
[1:35:09] first to have the Dynamics and what is
[1:35:11] the mechanics it's the word of God and
[1:35:14] you go chopping all that firewood down
[1:35:16] or like Ruth Gathering all the sheaves
[1:35:19] in the field over and over and then
[1:35:23] you've got it all stacked now all it
[1:35:25] takes is a match to be thrown into it
[1:35:28] and it ignites now it is the fruits the
[1:35:32] dynamic expression of the mechanics the
[1:35:36] lived the the doctrine that you've heard
[1:35:38] actually lived out so now now you can
[1:35:41] see that the
[1:35:43] fruit we're we're past y'all y'all sung
[1:35:47] a little bit so I'm going to preach a
[1:35:48] little bit
[1:35:50] y'all I'm going to take my time we only
[1:35:53] got one service so y'all going to have
[1:35:55] to deal with
[1:35:56] it and the Lamb of the dove brother said
[1:35:59] now the fruit of the spirit is not
[1:36:00] joining church right the fruit of the
[1:36:03] spirit is not smoking cigarettes come on
[1:36:05] or or quit smoking cigarettes the fruit
[1:36:07] is not to speak with tongues the fruit
[1:36:09] is not to pray for the sick and they be
[1:36:11] healed the fruit of the spirit is not to
[1:36:13] prophesy or preach but the fruit of the
[1:36:16] spirit is found in the Galatians
[1:36:19] 5:22 and now Paul's taking that symbolic
[1:36:22] match and throw into the wood pile it's
[1:36:26] love it's joy peace goodness long
[1:36:31] suffering Faith meekness gentleness amen
[1:36:35] that's the fruit of the spirit now he
[1:36:37] said no matter how much you preach you
[1:36:41] got a real ill temper don't do you much
[1:36:45] good to preach right no matter how much
[1:36:49] you join church and try to
[1:36:51] impersonate if you're cra
[1:36:54] and nasty with your neighbor you'll
[1:36:57] never win him to Christ in see it's the
[1:37:00] fruit of the spirit as my wife used to
[1:37:03] tell me actions speak louder than words
[1:37:07] now now there's where you get into the
[1:37:09] you talk about getting into the seals Y
[1:37:11] what does this got to do with the seals
[1:37:13] we've been preaching in symbols for so
[1:37:15] long this is a symbol of this this is a
[1:37:17] symbol of that until all of a sudden you
[1:37:19] see the symbol come into reality it's
[1:37:22] something it's the mechanic laying there
[1:37:24] on the page that you can look at it's
[1:37:26] stacked up nice stacked up cordwood it's
[1:37:28] stacked up real nice and you can talk
[1:37:31] about it and everything but now that's
[1:37:33] why now is not the time to preach in
[1:37:35] symbols it's a living reality manifested
[1:37:38] in his bride in this day so I we could
[1:37:41] almost say with boldness that if you're
[1:37:42] preaching in symbol form now you're
[1:37:44] actually not preaching the revealed word
[1:37:46] of the day because the message is no
[1:37:48] longer in symbol form you know looking
[1:37:51] back at and the days going by it's like
[1:37:52] you know some times pre people would
[1:37:54] preach things vaguely with great gaps
[1:37:56] and understanding and and not really say
[1:37:59] things clearly or plainly but that
[1:38:01] time's over amen it it's time to preach
[1:38:04] it clearly and plainly because the Revel
[1:38:06] the book has been opened and we can see
[1:38:08] clearly clearly what that Lon is a
[1:38:11] genuine Holy Ghost anointing in a
[1:38:13] believer's life clearly what that white
[1:38:15] horse rider is a power of the Antichrist
[1:38:18] moving in the people to elevate a a a
[1:38:21] leader over them what is it it's the the
[1:38:24] the spirit in the people to elevate and
[1:38:26] express somebody over them that finally
[1:38:29] manifest and somebody that will go over
[1:38:31] in in Israel and sit down and take over
[1:38:34] his it will manifest in a beast right
[1:38:37] and and and we can see all these symbols
[1:38:39] of the ab bow with no erors that it's
[1:38:41] the devil bluffing you a bluff a bluff
[1:38:44] against the real Christian that knows
[1:38:46] where he stands and now we're not
[1:38:48] preaching and symbol anymore but we're
[1:38:50] preaching a living reality and brother
[1:38:52] will say now that's Thunder against the
[1:38:54] enemy when you've got these real fruits
[1:38:56] the fruit of a real believer manifested
[1:38:59] in your flesh really lived out lived out
[1:39:02] that what was first expressed in symbol
[1:39:05] but now is expressed in your in your two
[1:39:08] feet in your two hands behind your eyes
[1:39:11] it's actually lived out in your
[1:39:13] understanding that now you've got the
[1:39:14] mind of Christ which brother Brown said
[1:39:16] was the character of Christ you've got
[1:39:19] the mind of Christ which is the
[1:39:20] character of Christ and now you've got
[1:39:22] the same Doctrine the same life the same
[1:39:26] characteristics that's Thunder against
[1:39:28] the
[1:39:29] enemy brother R said it was it's conf it
[1:39:32] was confusing to him y y'all okay for a
[1:39:34] few more
[1:39:35] minutes
[1:39:37] amen he
[1:39:39] said it was my Earnest desire to learn
[1:39:41] all that I could about these gifts so I
[1:39:43] decided to talk to these two men at this
[1:39:45] Pentecostal meeting because it's
[1:39:47] confusing about this anointing you see
[1:39:49] somebody rejoicing and worshiping and a
[1:39:52] genuine anointing what's going on and he
[1:39:55] said through the gift of God resident in
[1:39:57] me I sought to know the spirit and the
[1:39:59] first man and we all know the story so
[1:40:01] I'm kind of glossing over quickly over
[1:40:04] over the the background there was there
[1:40:07] was two men one speaking in tongues one
[1:40:09] interpreting and and the Holy Ghost was
[1:40:11] really moving in that meeting and so he
[1:40:14] wanted to talk to him he said after a
[1:40:16] brief conversation with that sweet
[1:40:19] humble brother
[1:40:25] this genuine brother was sweet and
[1:40:27] humble I knew that he was a genuine
[1:40:32] solid Christian he was
[1:40:35] real the next young man was not at all
[1:40:39] like the first one now he's going to get
[1:40:41] to the part where he can see the
[1:40:42] adultery living in his life and
[1:40:43] everything but before he gets to that
[1:40:45] what does he say he was boastful and
[1:40:49] proud and as I spoke to him a vision
[1:40:52] moved across my eyes and I saw that he
[1:40:54] was married to a blind lady but was
[1:40:56] living with a brunette and had two
[1:40:57] children by her if ever there was a
[1:41:00] hypocrite he was
[1:41:03] one now this would be confusing to
[1:41:06] anybody you you know I I I was talking
[1:41:08] to somebody recently that kind of a mark
[1:41:11] of your spiritual maturity is that as
[1:41:13] you grow in Christ things that used to
[1:41:17] really be confusing begin to get ironed
[1:41:20] out exactly right and brother random
[1:41:23] said he said now I was confused sure
[1:41:26] enough I thought I had come into Angels
[1:41:30] then I wondered if I wasn't among Devils
[1:41:34] right now could you imagine now really
[1:41:36] put yourself in his shoes to be in an
[1:41:39] anointed Pentecostal meeting where
[1:41:41] people are running the aisles and
[1:41:43] speaking in tongues and interpreting
[1:41:45] tongues but because of his gift he could
[1:41:47] tell this person ain't true what makes
[1:41:51] you genuine it's the word yes that
[1:41:54] you've heard the word and you've held on
[1:41:56] to the word until it's it's got you into
[1:41:59] the rhythm of the word for your day not
[1:42:02] the rhythm of a bygone age like a
[1:42:04] vulture eating on some maggoty meat but
[1:42:08] an eagle eating on a present tense
[1:42:10] revealed word for your day some meat
[1:42:12] that's got some blood in it some life
[1:42:14] that will transform you and change your
[1:42:17] character now now there's the difference
[1:42:20] it's not the emotions or the feelings
[1:42:23] are Sensations that we live by but it's
[1:42:25] the word of God and I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:42:27] close give me five minutes and I'm going
[1:42:29] to close in John chapter 6 Jesus said
[1:42:32] verily verily I say unto you except you
[1:42:34] eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[1:42:36] drink his blood you have no life in you
[1:42:38] you you don't have any life it don't
[1:42:39] matter how much you pray and how much
[1:42:41] you fast if you don't eat his flesh and
[1:42:43] drink his blood you don't have life
[1:42:45] that's right brother I want go on to say
[1:42:47] he said we're living by dead substance
[1:42:50] that's the only way that you can live
[1:42:51] and if something has to die every day so
[1:42:53] you live natural then isn't it true that
[1:42:56] if your body has to live by dead
[1:42:58] substance for natural life then you got
[1:43:00] to have something die spiritually to
[1:43:02] save your spiritual life and God became
[1:43:05] material flesh and died that we might
[1:43:08] live fulfilling that type in the Old
[1:43:11] Testament of where God had to have a way
[1:43:14] to differentiate the Israelites from the
[1:43:16] Egyptians and so he had to K had them
[1:43:18] kill the lamb and go behind the blood
[1:43:21] that they put over the Len of their door
[1:43:22] and eat the whole thing and they had to
[1:43:25] eat that thing eat it all and that was
[1:43:28] the differentiation they went in there
[1:43:30] behind the shed blood and that
[1:43:33] differentiated the true and the false
[1:43:35] and that still is the same
[1:43:37] differentiation today you eat the
[1:43:39] revealed word for your day and while the
[1:43:42] rest of the world might be shouting and
[1:43:44] under emotionalism and things but yet
[1:43:46] you're in a soble sober relationship
[1:43:49] with God eating that Mana that fell down
[1:43:52] from God where Jesus said I am the
[1:43:54] living bread which came down from heaven
[1:43:56] If any man eat of this bread he shall
[1:43:58] live forever and the bread that I will
[1:44:00] give is my flesh which I will give for
[1:44:02] the life of the world as the musicians
[1:44:03] come he said it is the spirit that
[1:44:06] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[1:44:09] the words that I speak unto you they are
[1:44:11] spirit and they are life oh my friends
[1:44:14] we're not coming to church in vain but
[1:44:17] if you're actually receptive to the word
[1:44:19] that you are hearing and you meditate it
[1:44:22] soberly something is actually
[1:44:24] transforming your mind and your
[1:44:26] character and your being until you are
[1:44:29] manifesting the doctrine that you have
[1:44:31] heard it's living out in you and brother
[1:44:34] R would go on to say he said it's
[1:44:35] actually a sign of the end a sign of the
[1:44:38] end that these things are being
[1:44:41] known in Matthew 24 it would be a sign
[1:44:44] of the end now aren't you glad this
[1:44:46] morning that you can tell the
[1:44:50] difference and not in a finger pointing
[1:44:52] way right but in an introspection way
[1:44:56] where you can look in the mirror of
[1:44:57] God's word and say my life my faith is
[1:45:00] not grounded upon what another man says
[1:45:03] about me my life and my faith is not
[1:45:06] grounded on
[1:45:08] emotionalism my life and not and my
[1:45:10] faith is not grounded upon whether I
[1:45:12] follow a certain Ministry or not but it
[1:45:16] is solely based upon the word of God and
[1:45:21] a personal revelation
[1:45:23] between me and God alone and nobody else
[1:45:28] oh I think that's why Jesus brother R
[1:45:30] preached that sermon that when he
[1:45:31] preached the Rapture he was quoting
[1:45:32] David hide me in thy Pavilion where just
[1:45:36] me and God Alone not based upon what
[1:45:39] somebody else says about me not based
[1:45:42] upon any other credentials but my
[1:45:44] credentials are the word of God and the
[1:45:47] life token that has been applied over
[1:45:50] the L of my doorpost God bless you as we
[1:45:52] stand to

[1:46:29] word's been preached and the Word was
[1:46:30] sent to loose the spirit in our lives oh

[1:49:08] from the gospel they're drawn to it
[1:49:10] that's why Jesus said ye are the salt of
[1:49:12] the earth don't hide your light under a
[1:49:15] bushel but let the whole world see what
[1:49:17] a real Christian is that others can be

[1:50:55] bit let me just gather myself I waited
[1:50:56] all morning and this is not an easy
[1:50:59] subject to talk about so I'm just going
[1:51:01] to talk and uh get my heart to calm down
[1:51:04] and my knees to stop
[1:51:07] shaking first I want to talk about what
[1:51:09] um brother Wade brought last week about
[1:51:11] the chosen what the chosen does for me
[1:51:14] is it makes me go to the word the
[1:51:17] characters I want to go and read up on
[1:51:18] them the situations I want to go and
[1:51:21] read up on it so I don't know if you've
[1:51:23] checked it out or not but it's helped me
[1:51:24] in that way that gives us that Ryan time
[1:51:27] that every little bit helps um I want to
[1:51:31] this is a spin-off from My Voice by the
[1:51:34] way forgive me if you can't hear me um
[1:51:37] the doctor's checking out a chemical
[1:51:40] burn from that plume down there from
[1:51:42] that biolab so I might have to call on
[1:51:45] the in-house interpreters better have to
[1:51:48] interpret for me anyway um a CP of it's
[1:51:53] about the scam is what brother Louise
[1:51:55] talked about last
[1:51:57] Sunday I'm going drop a couple of
[1:51:59] nuggets just a quick two of them um I
[1:52:02] was before I get to that one I was
[1:52:05] robbed at the library a few years ago
[1:52:08] it's about focus and awareness now
[1:52:10] sometimes when you have Focus your
[1:52:12] awareness diminishes because I was so
[1:52:15] focused on the screen I was on the
[1:52:16] computer my purse was right by um the
[1:52:19] keyboard and that person over there in
[1:52:22] that next cubicle took a wallet out now
[1:52:25] I'm OCD so I had two wallets I'm upset
[1:52:28] about the fact that they took my um $50
[1:52:31] gift card for Cheesecake Factory
[1:52:34] hello all right the other one is um we
[1:52:38] have a lot of Travelers and you just
[1:52:39] have to be aware wherever you go um I
[1:52:42] went on a cruise back in
[1:52:44] 2015 with uh 13 other women and one of
[1:52:48] the stops was Rome I didn't go into Rome
[1:52:51] cuz I spent a I was blessed to spend a
[1:52:52] lot of time in Rome when I was a flight
[1:52:54] attendant so I didn't go
[1:52:56] in matter of fact with that y'all i s I
[1:52:59] went to see a pope Ling in state that
[1:53:01] was pretty awesome you know the nuns are
[1:53:04] lined up it's a like a mile or two to
[1:53:06] get to the Vatican Down The Long walkway
[1:53:09] and they were lined up on each side
[1:53:11] singing harmoniously you know that and
[1:53:13] then the pope was lying in state dressed
[1:53:16] to the nines his pontiff was leather
[1:53:19] maroon shoes to match it was awesome but
[1:53:22] anyway get back to the point uh so the
[1:53:24] women went a couple of women went into
[1:53:26] Rome and while they were on the tram
[1:53:29] they got robbed now the trim is crowded
[1:53:33] you know tourists well the locals know
[1:53:35] that's where they get their income from
[1:53:37] one lady had her pouch right here on her
[1:53:40] chest y'all on her chest he went in or
[1:53:44] they went in unzipped it took $400 out
[1:53:48] of that pouch right on her chest that's
[1:53:51] how savvy
[1:53:53] what's going on here okay um the other
[1:53:56] lady had her uh fanny pack on her hip
[1:54:00] went in took $200 out so just be aware
[1:54:03] wherever you go this stuff is happening
[1:54:07] now to the main thing I wanted to talk
[1:54:09] about is the scam I was scammed two two
[1:54:12] months
[1:54:14] ago
[1:54:16] um how does this happen to a woman whose
[1:54:20] work since she was 12 years
[1:54:23] who's a good Steward of her
[1:54:26] monies who worked for a credit card w h
[1:54:29] here for 10 years who caught a fraud
[1:54:31] case while working there you ask how
[1:54:34] does this happen to me possible factors
[1:54:38] are I'm home alone have been for a year
[1:54:43] um cesing from my
[1:54:47] knee shut off from the world is how this
[1:54:50] possibly could have happened
[1:54:55] we had a court case from the Connecticut
[1:54:57] situation when my sister passed the step
[1:55:00] children contesting her will we had a
[1:55:04] virtual court case soon as that shut
[1:55:06] down this screen popped up on this
[1:55:09] laptop that I don't even use I only have
[1:55:11] the laptop for my
[1:55:13] book loud like brother Louise said that
[1:55:17] roaring lion it was an alarm on it in
[1:55:19] everything that roaring lion took Regina
[1:55:23] out of her body because that's the only
[1:55:25] way I can explain this it was an out of
[1:55:27] it felt like an outof Body Experience
[1:55:29] y'all I'm very mindful of my money I'm
[1:55:32] very mindful of stuff like
[1:55:34] that they said call Microsoft security I
[1:55:38] did I got this fake Eric of course and
[1:55:41] he said let's take a look there's
[1:55:43] $110,000 coming through on your
[1:55:47] card we need to call your bank put a
[1:55:49] 72-hour Security on it the guy sitting
[1:55:53] next to him I'm sure we got on the phone
[1:55:55] Stefan I don't remember if I gave him my
[1:55:57] bank he just transferred me okay
[1:56:00] y'all um that Stefan put a 72h hour
[1:56:04] Security on it and then he tells me the
[1:56:07] way to do away with that charge is to
[1:56:09] charge another
[1:56:12] 10,000 hello y'all it's real it's real
[1:56:16] and so he instructed me asked me if I
[1:56:18] was dress and everything I said well you
[1:56:20] know none of your business but he said
[1:56:22] okay let me look up where you can go to
[1:56:24] do this he said Lowe's and
[1:56:27] Conor that wasn't Regina that got in her
[1:56:30] car y'all and went to Lowe's and
[1:56:34] purchased five gift cards $2,000
[1:56:39] each okay two and then tell you to make
[1:56:43] up a story for the
[1:56:45] cashier get back in your car they're on
[1:56:47] the phone with you the whole time get
[1:56:50] back in your car drive to another her
