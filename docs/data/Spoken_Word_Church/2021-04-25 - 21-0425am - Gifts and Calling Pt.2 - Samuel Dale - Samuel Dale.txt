the house of the lord we're glad to have the collins family with us our church they all came up to be with us today and everything we appreciate them coming and and all and just our brother was telling me yesterday that he's he's been ministering to the church there so that's good to have somebody to where you can have a church to go to and all it's a great thing so you know pray the lord would would take care of him and give him whatever is to be said to the people and and and to be led on and that and we just appreciate it he said he was was uh having to lead singing and then preach i said well i've been through some of them things myself you know a few times and where we had to had to depend on one person or something to do everything but god will bless and take care of it he'll bring it all to pass and do it also just just remember them and remember that the families there but just remember sister kathy and the gabriel family the lord would be with him in this time of the loss of the loved one and all and we had an opportunity yesterday to just kind of talk a little bit about brother ray and and have a memorial and not a funeral because i i don't like funerals that's all right but we have to have them but why not have a memorial and because that person is not there see uh you it's know first it's not going on so they're not there you can look around and see a casket you can look around and see a body you can look around and see uh whatever they call that the urn or what it is to uh do you know for the ashes you can have all of that but still that that's nothing uh they're not there anyway it doesn't go on on and they're waiting on us that's the main thing all of these has gone on before us they are waiting on us to come to that place so we have a good job to do right okay remember that remember anna's sick this morning with a headache keep her in your prayers and and things and just remember that let's see i wrote my own stuff in oak or uh yeah i want to thank everybody for all of the things there are the birthday gifts and things that we received last week we had a a good time and all in the cake and ice cream and had a fellowship together and we appreciate that uh for doing uh they was one president gave to me and i thought well nanny said first said we ought to just wire that well we decided that wasn't the right way to do but maybe they can pull up enough to be able to see what we've got tell me if you got it zeroed in okay if i need to move or whatever you know can you read that it says i look 29 i feel 28. i act 24. but i'm really 81. see if you add up all the numbers you get 81. so i'm really just i'm 81. so that's uh that's the point you know that the shirt tells it all i'm just 81. i'm an 81 year old kid living in an old body and looking forward to being back young again one of these days and have a glorious time together in the lord all right if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to romans 8. let's see um brother bob is up preaching at bro at blue ridge so remember him and pray the lord we're blessed brother aaron will be ministering this coming wednesday so remember that and uh bible study this coming saturday okay now we're going to our times of having our bible study so if you want to come on saturday and be with us you know and have a good time together we fellowship together we can kind of scatter out in the basement and have um time together and a little fellowship and thing and have questions and answers now i love questions and answers i do that that's one thing that you know to me could be every service could be questions and answers because you know that's the point i i love to have questions and answers so if you have something on your heart come and we'll we'll just sit down and talk about it and and you know be able to do that this coming weekend it's six o'clock all right then let's see you'll be gone yeah we was planning on going to have what what was we have to cancel off what we can we're not going to have sunday school right now may the 9th we'll start our sunday school classes okay so that way we'll get it all together and have all of the doing of that part so remember all of these anything else that pray for brother danny uh he's having still a lot of problems he has the virus and now you know they're having a lot of trouble because he had pneumonia too when he went to the doctor the other day so just keep him in your prayers rejoicing them are kind of they're okay they're blending in and doing but uh still it's hard to to live in that situation sometimes of of uh you know uh pneumonia and things it'll it'll get a hold of you and it leaves you wore out so just remember danny remember joyce and and hope and all that and we're all a little bright anybody else i've always missed you know always as terrance said he covers it on a good point he said all those that we're praying for all the time well we may not call your name but we just pray you know for everybody that is sick among us and prayed the lord would reach down into us and that way our all of our names are called it's all into that okay all right so we're going to romans 11 and then we'll go to uh psalms 68 all right so we go to romans 11 and and pick up our a couple of scriptures we want to deal with and then going into our thought father we thank you for this day and your grace unto us thank you for all things thank you for your love and to us and lord we pray that you would just bless and guide each one be in the service today and bless all of us together rest sister collins and all of the little group there from from lincolnton lord and just be with them and be with our brother as he's starting out into the ministry and young and all but lord he can be used if he'll just follow you he may not think he's got anything but he if he can put it in your hands it can turn out to be a lot of doing and he can direct the family along in the things of life lord we pray you're just blessed forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness remember the sick and just have your way in jesus name amen it's going to be kind of a odd part to take but you just bear with us and uh so we're going to romans where we've been reading and we'll just read verse 29 of romans 11 and it says for the gifts now what's gifts plural all right and calling singular there's just really one calling all are called by the same blood of jesus christ the same atonements etc but there's many gifts in the body of christ all right so for the gifts and callings of god are without repentance you don't have to repent to get a gift see that's where brother brown said he differed with the uh i believe it was a ladder rain brethren or something but he said that they believed he laying on the hands for gifts and things he said that's not true he said you're born with a gift it's not doesn't come by laying on the hands that stirs up the gift what is it the scripture says are you know the the gift that was in thee from thy grandmother coming well the gift wasn't from grandmother the gift was the faith of the grandmother applied coming down until when it did she just would lay hands on and i believe in we ordained ministers we ordained deacons etc because we believe in it i believe in laying on hand the prophet believed in that but not believing of laying on our hands to give you a gift but to stir up the gift that's already there from god himself because that's the only one that's worth anything all right so now let's go to psalms 68 i may have put these in backwards to them but we'll get it anyway psalm 68 verse 18. and watch now this is the old testament looking forward so that's you know my point was what on the live service we went backward we go back into the mind of god we talk about the gifts and the callings et cetera and believing it and then we keep on to our reach our destiny because that's what we believe in what you are predestinated by foreknowledge not that god desired anybody to be lost etc he desired all to be saved but he predestinated by his foreknowledge all right see then if you have a gift within you we're not going to pray for you to uh necessarily work that gift we pray that god will anoint you and he can take care of those things and and we do it in that style because that's the way all right see what thou has ascended on high thou hast led captivity captive thou hast received gifts for men yea for the rebellious also that the lord god might dwell among you now go over to ephesians 4 while you're doing it i'll say this word about it think about it now remember the prophet says everybody i gave it to you last week we'll go back through it everybody is born with a gift of some kind because you're a human being all right you have a gift it may be to sow or cook or work on cars or whatever but god can take that and activate it as we'll go through the message and bring it out to being worth something all right but see all the way back there now the psalmist looking forward to calvary and he says thou has to send it on high we know what that's for huh thou hast led captivity captive thou has received gifts for men see receive if you receive something there's got to be somebody to give it all right so then gifts and callings of god give some calling of god all right but for the rebellious why because everybody has a gift art ephesians i don't remember where did i put that on there for him to use it but you know we'll get to that point okay ephesians 4 well to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men right back to the psalmist telling you what's taking place now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things now talk about gifts now watch what he says and he gave some they said about gifts now he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ you may be seated the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word i want you to keep in mind what we will be dealing with for a while and i'll keep repeating it because i want you to understand what i'm talking about then you can decide whether or not you believe that that's left up to you but see if we can believe the word of god then all things are possible to them that believe so why are we concerned about anything i'm not concerned about missing it or something why because god already even back a psalmist even back there the psalmist david saw i mean you know in the dave psalmist david in his speaking he would say he led captivity he's looking forward as i said to calvary and he's saying even the rebellious well you mean god would deal with rebellious people i thank god he's always dealt with us you know we didn't all come into the world being too good of a background right but he's he'll promised it all right so he said it back there he said he would give gifts he received gifts all right now here he says that he's going to give gifts to the church and he names it and names the fivefold ministry all right then he says and that fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the saints right see it's got the answer to it he he's he's got it all set out for us but we've got to to follow the right way now the prophet said that this way he said ever how you treat the ministry is the way you're treating god you honor the ministry god will honor you you dishonor the ministry he'll he'll dishonor you but he'll also do one thing he'll take out the ministry come on go to the church age book and pick up where your prophet shows it how that he would take out he will take away your minister well you say well we've got a lot of that we're in the days where there's a lot of preachers doing this out of there we've got a lot of we're in a day when we've got a lot of people that's gone this way or the other but that ain't got nothing to do with me and you mean you better be concerned what we're doing here in our little assembly and what we're gathered for in the things you know to be able to put our part and see everybody has a part we are the body of christ correct and being the body of christ each individual has something to do well i don't have nothing to do brother dale uh i i've sit here for years and nobody's told me what to do well listen gifts are without repentance so you don't repent to get a gift so it's not you come up to the front here and say brother they'll lay hands on me then i get a gift to help the church it wouldn't work anyway come on am i right with the prophet the way he said it he said if you volunteer to do something you've got a lot of problems but if god has to run you down and knock you down you'll be used that's way what he said when he came to me and he said daddy i got something i want to talk to you about i said you don't want to talk to me he said you know what i'm talking about i said i've known what you're talking about for many years just waiting on you i said if you don't believe me go ask your mother that i told her we would that you would be coming back to the lord not only that that you would be right here standing beside of me as a minister in this church i told her that two or three years before wade came back or many years before and we believed it and accepted it well see then he said what to do what do you want to say i do i said run ask him you know how it would be with most ministers in this message if their son come up and said well i've got i i believe i'm called daddy you think i want to go to prison oh yes sir you're called we're going to put you right in here no i said uh i said run i said run until he runs you down i said run until you can't run no more then when you do i said because the prophet said if you volunteer for something you won't never do it right but if you if it's not then you'll find it'll work he came to me one day and he said because i didn't tell him about the part of the ministry when that was first happened i told him about the lord showing him coming back and he he come back and you know and he told me he said well well daddy said i feel like this i said yeah that's part of what the lord showed me you'd be standing beside him in the ministry all right see why because i believe in gifts and callings as being without repentance you don't you don't repent you don't you don't volunteer for a gift not in the bible now where everything else you got gifts you give people but not in the bible terminologies in the bible terminologies you've got uh things that are odd being said that you have to have sometimes help breaking it down to be able to comprehend what's being said all right and see then that way gifts and calling but he says make your calling an election sure brother up in tennessee years ago he had backslidden things and he's telling me he's one day that he said how is it i get i still get messages he said i know i'm backslid i know i'm not right with god we said i still get messages just like i did i said that's the gift he said that has nothing to do with you that's the gift the gift is still there it'll always be there because the gift comes from god now the psalmist said it did because he said he received gifts for men did you catch the way he said it no psalm it was for men in other words future tense huh then when he comes up here to ephesians then he just lays it out what it is all right see then that's what we need to understand and to make sure we don't forget think about this see gifts there's many gifts everybody has a gift of some kind a natural gift you have natural gifts that you come into the world you can do things that other people can't do right you you can do something that other people just they just can't do it they just go haywire trying to figure it out why because it's a gift all right it's a natural gift okay now that's great to be that way but what about when god can take that gift and activate it for the gospel right take your your gift activate it he can that's what they said you know laying on the hands see they got confused about it it's not laying on hands to get a gift it's laying on the hands to activate the gift or to bring the gift alive you see then you can use it you know that brother branham said that every church would be responsible for what they do with the gifts oh but we don't believe in gifts we don't we don't believe in speaking in tongues shouting and crying to show me where it was took out of the bible i'll show you where it was put in you showed me where it was took out not so it's there and if we don't use it we'll have to give an account so then that's what we're trying to say there last sunday about it that even your natural life you have gifts in things knowledge and and and different things you know understanding and and things you have wisdom and you have many many gifts all right that can be in a person and you can do you can that gift can be operating before you ever even start the fact of being born again you get somebody that's kind of like myself i you'd never think it but when i was up to about 16 years of age i was so bashful until uh i would not look at you when you were talking to me where is i now because i just couldn't do it i i was too biased full well i began to try to get rid of that and i thought well my goodness now why am i supposed to be bicycle i'm just as good as they are i'm i'm come out of the same dirt everybody else comes and that's the only thing that i've ever tried to teach my kids or anything teach them to be what they're supposed to be put forth their gifts if they could play balls play ball you know if they could learn to work on cars learn to work on cars whatever it was some natural part of your life would fall in line and you'd see it would just be an automatic process well you know what being a christian is an automatic process you remember how we were trying to bring it out at least you'd cover three stages of the fact that you do it that there's gifts of the natural that you have gifts in your life you was able to do things in your life that other people were not able to do all right then you come into the christian realm and you got nine spiritual gifts all right second corinthians covers whatever 12-13 it covers the gifts there's many gifts and see the holy spirit can come on you and activate a natural gift giving you the new birth and turn that into a spiritual heavenly understanding and put that gift to work then you can see that the people you know you you say well well it just come to me where to and i have discernment i i just you know the lord's showing me things well praise god praise god then let that act be activated like i said i was so bashful until then it was just pitiful you wouldn't think that now for nothing in the world because you see i turned that around to where it would i would not be the bashful part and started working upon those natural things well see then when i become born again then it was easy to step into line you know a point and and at 18 at uh 23 years of age i was a deacon in the baptist church they saw the gifts with their the the things that you know that i had understanding of the scriptures that i had things that you know they enjoyed it and when i quit the baptist church i had to resign from about five offices that i was was working in and one of them was teaching the adult sunday school class which was the deacons and elders and their wives the adults that was what i was doing and i was only in my 20s you know you don't know this see but you asked somebody to say how was you when you become a deacon 40. how was you what you're 50. you just don't you you wouldn't back there it might be changed now but back there you didn't become a deacon at 23 years of age you understand they saw there was something about it that they even went into that and ordained me a deacon i was was well thought of in the reference realms or the the baptist ranks i could go to the to the to the meetings i could do why because i had got rid of that natural thing and come to the to the point of believing the new birth as far as i could understand i put it that way for correctly because i didn't claim the new birth at that point but as much as i could understand but it began to develop into the point that god could use me into doing things and you know you'd have to come in up in the ranks with us but then the baptist said pretty well give like wade's a sunday school for the teachers they'd give him a book to go by and stories in the book and you you you know everybody had to lay out according to that well they gave them to me and i just laid it down and when i'd started i'd just start talking to the people you know you remember how i told you the other day about brother gary atkins you know when he told me he said i i i they want me to be a teacher a sunday school team but i can't teach i said it was ever very easy because brother gary had already passed over he wasn't in the bicycle stages he's beyond all of that he was he was you know i said just read romans 1 and start talking he came back three or four weeks later and he said i said how's it going he said i ain't got out of romans 1 yet i said i've tried to tell you that if you'll just let god just yield to him then the gift will come to working because there's nine spiritual gifts that are in the body of christ that you're not even talking about five full ministry and things we're having that's why i'm having to divide that and put it as natural gifts and then for you to think about then let god come and give you a new birth and then let that start activating that natural gift and bringing it into understanding that it can be used and then maybe one day you might be called to be a minister all right and see that's that's the the things that we need to understand i've tried to explain the fifo ministry to the people of this message and and i've had so much trouble with it until i finally got where i said forget it i just won't try to explain what i see but the bible said he gave some apostles some prophets some pastors some teachers you know what and i found one the other day where the prophet said it he said he give you what you have need of he said some people need a pastor some people need a teacher i mean you've told me that from your own words you know well brother dale i i like the way you do because i like a teacher but some others go you know maybe even leave the church or whatever because they didn't understand what that is and they'd rather have an evangelist well that could be part of the doing but get what i'm talking about see you have natural gifts that can work on into the rest of your life and work and and you become to where that you can god can activate those things and then there's nine spiritual gifts in the the body of christ in the church and those nine spiritual gifts brought around use it up now listen to the wording he uses the nine spiritual gifts and says they are for the perfecting of the saints see then the bible comes on over and picks up the fifo ministry and said it's for the perfecting of the science and you remember how the gifts they are in see there's a lot of difference between a a prophet and a gift of prophecy there's a lot of difference in wisdom knowledge and things of those things that are in the gifts right go to rome go to first corinthians or second corinthians about 12 and 13 and study the gifts because paul then turns around and says desire the most earnest gift or the best see he wasn't satisfied for the people to just sit down with a gift i'm not satisfied with that i've had people to tell me so brother dale i believe i have a gift i said don't worry about it i won't set you down but you know what i'm talking about some of the preachers in this message you'd start doing it and man they just shut you down and tell you to shut up because they don't believe in the gifts well i believe in all of the gifts i believe in the nine spiritual gifts i believe in the in in those things but i believe that they are without a calling like we think they are you can't practice it or work it up well we'll send him to school now you see why the prophet was against that he said we'll send him to school we'll we'll let him go to school and learn how to be a preacher now how are you going to learn how to be a preacher well you can learn how to be him like most people are because they're not a god called preacher they're just a preacher but see you can't do that you even the gifts of the nine spiritual gifts the prophet said you can prophesy one time that gift can operate on you and you prophesy one time and he said never use you again now that's a gift in the body of christ that you can have a wisdom knowledge and things to go into the love joy peace go into to help working into the stature of a perfect man because that's how it works for these virtues to come into the body of christ you need help a lot of times all right that's to help that even just to nine spiritual gifts work in that to help see all right but you understand what i'm getting at see then you have the gifts well you're going to be responsible for not using it but brother dale i'm afraid of well what do you think i'm doing i'm having to stand up here before the whole congregation i'm having to leave myself open to everybody in the building to say if you don't agree with me come and tell me show me where i miss it all right but you see what i'm getting at see you got the natural gifts of life god can move that over into a realm and putting you in the new birth and putting you in the body of christ and activate those gifts that way that you'll wind up to be what he wants you to be in the in the nine spiritual gifts that's in the body right and it'll work me you know i wish i could sing i'm like brother brown that's one of those things that i wish i could do if i could sing like some of you can michael gets up here i won't punch him in the nose why because he just flows aaron he just it just you know you just flow well why i can't do that because in a minute i'm going to go ah you know it's up and down and running out somewhere i can base a little bit you know sang a little bit on that line but i wish i could sing to the glory of god i honor like george beverly shea i believe is his name with billy graham he had a marvelous voice i mean it was just marvelous that the man could sing for the glory of the lord but you get what i'm talking about see god can work with you in what you've got don't worry about trying to volunteer it the bible says for us to wait on our gifts don't go out and jump out and run like everything with it you know maybe i shouldn't say it but i'm just human enough and i try to get points across to you that i don't want to hurt your feelings but i know i do but if you ever notice people that can't sing they're going to sing four verses out of the song they're gonna they're gonna pick us and it's only got three verses and there's one with four that's dirty but is it true right see at least i tell you i'm straight i'm honest about it i sit there sometimes and say well hey take off verse 4. because you hadn't got verse one right yet i know that's accurate but it'll make you practice practice your gift work on it put it to work see you know what i'm talking about some people are just we always call it wrong and do it but we always say that brother or sister one got a gift to gab it's always been said about aaron but i won't never call it that way you know but aaron could walk he could stand out there and talk to a power pole all day long you say you're going oh no that's a gift he can do it he can talk to things he can do things but see i want it to be for porn for nothing else for us to see that god wants what he wants to take what we've got but he wants to activate that and continually just keep activating him all right because you got the natural gifts all right then you've got the nine spiritual gifts in the body of christ that god can use those gifts but that don't mean you're a preacher that's where the problem with people they get a calling in their life to move up a little bit and as they do and i knew this in the baptist church because i i believed it and i've always taught it since coming out see you get people that they just they have a gift but they just won't go on with it then you got the others that that don't have no gifts they're the ones that want to go if you could ever get them straight you know in other words you use what you're doing okay all right see then activate the gift and you may speak in tongues you may shout you may cry you may do all things and have all kind of gifts but it may never be used but one time you say well i used to do this and i used to do that but i just i just ain't doing it no more now you know what you're gonna start doing you're gonna blame everybody around you well it ain't my fault i got a gift i can do it his brother telling me one time he said i can speak in tongues anytime i want to i said not according to the bible you can speak in tongues which is another language and i said that's what you've been doing you've been speaking in spanish and people are beginning to think that you're you're or something spiritual and i said you're doing that but i said that ain't what it is i hate it i had to say it because i just didn't agree i knew what he was doing and i didn't know a word of english i mean he worded spanish for him to tell him why but i knew that's what he was doing but take those gifts and and let god activate them and rejoice in doing those things and be part of the body of christ but see the the problem is is we all want to be a brother branham now i'm going to say something and i want you to just listen to what i'm saying because this will be the thought for the next couple of messages or for a while i know you've got the gifts it'll work natural gifts now you've got spiritual gifts in the nine spiritual gifts in the body of christ and they will work all right now you're coming up to word that we read and it says that he gave some apostles the prophets pastors all right we've got to nine come up from the from the gifts to the nine spiritual gifts and now come up to a fifo ministry right a fifo ministry then you've got a prophet like brother branham you got prophets in the bible you've got the agaves you've got the different ones and they can be used to bring things they could even tell peter or which one was it paul or peter that said you're going to be bound by this cloak and taken to rome the there's gifts that work all right and seeing that fivefold ministry gift is for the perfecting of the saints but then you've got the prophet's ministry that comes in malachi 4. that may i say it and mean it in the correct way brother branham tells us a prophet stands before no one now fightful ministry prophet we got to deal with that just a little bit because you got a little problem five full ministry profit ain't that the same as brother branham's gift brother branham could fulfill the whole 5-4 ministry because he was outside of the fifo ministry malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 is the word of god alive for the hour that we're living and he was the only one that could bring the word everybody else was to be be questioned or or are tested or checked to see but brother branham stood before no one that's why you can't do that even the basis i've tried to go this far when brother branham taught that the white horse rider was the antichrist i mean jesus christ when he taught that there was nobody to judge him clarence larkin taught it before then that the white horse rider was the antichrist before brother branham come along but yet he was not malachi 4. you say what do you think he's still riding a horse he couldn't get off the horse he was still riding the antichrist horse i'm talking about clarence larkin because he was still a denominational person that's why brother branham could not nobody could stand before him even though now watch him he said if you find me off in one thing he said i'm off in everything right you better get that straight you better back up from what you're doing there because you're correct correcting a prophet but that's what people's doing now they're saying well brother brian was wrong here in wrong guy there was nobody that could go before the prophet and get those seals you know go in advance into god or something in their own doing they couldn't do it it took the prophet to bring the word fifo ministry but there we'll get to that in the next message the fivefold ministry has got to line up with every word of the prophet we stand judged i preach as a judged minister that if i don't preach what the prophet preached i am condemned by my own words it would run around and said so-and-so and i don't believe that i believe it's this way go ahead just remember moses had the word of his day i don't care how many pharaohs there was moses didn't answer to nobody he didn't go out on the backside of the desert and try to find some other guy to help him out he stood on his arm you just think where that prophet stood he said you say what i say he says because i'll be judged now watch what i'm talking about while he was teaching the white horse rider as the holy ghost the word had not been unveiled yet so there was nobody oh yeah he listened to brother neville he listened to those brothers and said yeah i enjoyed that and got things he said he didn't get nothing i'm saying it the way i think i'm trying to get it right but yet there's nobody he stood before nobody he didn't have to answer to nobody he didn't have to go down to the pope to decide whether or not he could preach it like it was or any minister in the fifo ministry because there was no minister in the fifo ministry that could correct the prophet now you see why i'm so hard now with all these ministers and what they're doing with the message and how they're killing the message and destroying the very people that for years has believed the message and tried to stay with it and now they're just falling right in left this churches and things why because the preachers are trying to correct a prophet preachers you can't do that you can correct a congregation because that's your job but don't try to correct the prophet amen you say well the prophet said if i say one thing then you go you know i say well look at her he talked to a white horse rider wrong who could you judge it by you may not like that kind of language or thoughts i don't either but i like the truth right you can't correct a prophet he stands before god alone but then the fifo ministry we'll get to later you better be careful what you're doing with it well i don't have to have no preacher good and bye don't worry us don't worry yourself go home say oh you're tough ain't tough i'm just straight i just try to tell it like it is if you think you can straighten out brother branham's message we need to follow you i know 40 years ago i told them when they started doing those things i said would you do me one favor i said would you brothers that can do those things and straight and brother right around would you mind pulling off your shoes because i want to kiss your toe oh but brother dale that's that's being aggravating you're very nasty no no no no no you kiss the pope's toe you're declaring to be almighty god that's why brother branham would not do that right he said i'll do everything i can said they cut his pants off when he went before the king over there you know cut him and fixed him some way i don't understand what he'd done but he fixed him somewhere he volunteered for that he said and i'll call the pope brother he said but i will not kiss his toe my master is the only one that gets that what about a five-fold ministry then there's sitting down with her jinger jagger's little things little messages trying to hold people together and won't fight these things that's taking place in the message around the land it's time to stand up and say forget it but that was brother so-and-so now listen this is what gets me i i'm sorry i'm human what gets me is here comes somebody that's trying to straighten out the prophet in his message you know and they're the ones doing it but yet they claim that they are the leaders that take over well then what do you need brett around them for why don't you just step out on your own and say i'm god that's what i asked brother hansen one time about a certain place in this message and i said well this brother believes this is why i said what is that brother there believe he said he believes he's god i said well okay we got that straight so i have no reason to rally around something like that but you see the five-fold ministry has a great position i'll read these things later if the prophet had to say about it but just trying to get you to think the fivefold ministry stands now before the before god walking with the prophet's message do you understand what i'm saying we've got to walk with the prophet's message we can't have something that we think the prophet was wrong right we can't do it [Music] but see we use everything in the world to try to straighten out brother branham well then if i can straighten out brother branham i'm supposed to be god because that's the only one that i can find in the bible that's above that right i can't find no other big gift or some person or something that's supposed to come along and do all of these things so then that means that you're supposed i'm supposed to worship you well then you're just arrogant glory to god let me stay arrogant if it's the truth if it ain't then whack it and tell me i ain't telling the truth that's all i've ever said to the people of the message show me where i'm wrong we've been on the internet for how many years now right on the 20 i guess closer i remember exactly how long and it went worldwide well come and show me where i've missed the message oh but you don't believe this now show me where the prophet taught something that i don't believe okay but you see what i'm doing i'm showing where you and me both are in bad shape to try to fool with the prophet's message me and you both we can't correct him but he can correct us he stands before no one we stand before him you get it what he says is law right yeah but that's what i just said come and show me you say well the prophet was wrong here coming let's sit down and talk about it well the prophet was wrong about the white horse rider come and let's sit down and talk about it because no one could could teach that until the seals broke amen right and they broke to the prophet do you realize church that the prophet preached a message one day and that we are already judged you know me and you is already judged because we're judged by what we're doing with this message yeah but that's just what you think well come on let's talk about what you think i have no fear just tell you that we'll stand before our congregation and every who comes out to be right let them be right and who's wrong let it be wrong because that's me i believe in the five-fold ministry i believe a five-fold ministry is for the perfecting of the saints there's no scripture that said the prophet is for the perfecting of the saints show it to me but the whole bible now before you start calculating the whole bible shows you that the five-fold ministry and everything has got to come underneath that prophet and what he's teaching well he says things i don't understand well who are you you think you can straighten him out no but brother dale you're just not you're you just seem to been you've you've got where you're just hateful i don't see that i've changed that much but if i'm hateful i'm sorry well i am 81. right i got the proof for it not to show that i got a right to be arrogant and hateful no but do you believe the prophet that away can you put everything you've got if they come down to you now and start questioning you because it's coming eventually what's going to be your answer when they take the message and slap it in your face just like the statement i made a while ago brother branham made the statement he said if you find me off one word he said then i've got to be off all the way he said don't believe me that what he said well then what are you going to do about the white horse rider that all those years he talked to and what are you going to do with god when the prophet said and he was teaching in the message because in the church age book and he said if i've told you the truth let god come and vindicate it and god come down and vindicate it and him preaching that the white horse rider was the holy ghost come on wake up he said if i'm wrong i'm wrong yeah see god is just good enough to not have somebody to correct nothing because he didn't have to have it the prophet stood before no one but why can't the fifo ministry find their place of who they're supposed to be and what they're supposed to be gathered in and say this is it like i told you before about it back in the 70s they were arguing about the where the prophet was out there hunting on certain dates and it's that yeah but you see the old men of the message the one that was would come through with the prophet and thing a lot of them stood up and said we don't care what you bring this man brought us to god can you say that can you say this message brought me to god you don't have to practice and pour it out do you got a sister back there never been through organization one day she decided to come be one of us thank god she didn't have to be trained or tutored or reprogrammed see god's going to lead us he'll take us through i'm not concerned about that i'm concerned about me and you getting us ready against that day that we can see our part of what we're doing see no wonder the young kids don't want the message the mamas and daddies is not living them before them there's one thing the kids know for certain i've taught this 40 to 50 years ago we've got to take what he's saying it's not what you think about it it's not what you believe what i believe what you believe ain't got nothing to do with it it's what god said through a prophet just like i said that a minute ago now come on you know the prophet taught what he did and about the white horse rider what are you going to do when they come before you and say well he was wrong there how are you going to say it what are you going to tell them i'm going to tell them he wasn't wrong you're wrong well you you no no no god you see he was the prophet he's not god no no but i will say he was the closest thing they are to it in this generation in time i had no problem with that that don't make nothing no more out of him than any other human mortal because i believe every born-again believer i stand in jeffersonville indiana and this man was explaining how that brother branham was god it was deity i said if you'll i said brother if you'll tell i said that brother right there point it over to a man i said he says he's got the new birth the man's yeah i said well then if you'll say that brother branham's got the new birth like that man's got the new birth then i'll believe in deity because i believe every born-again believer is god made manifest in that human flesh in the new birth i believe you have the bear have the new birth you have the very god of the word living within your soul of course you know what happened i said but if you'll agree that that man's got the new birth and that makes him deity like brother branham's got the new birth and that makes him deity i'm explaining it to you i said i'll go along with you he said oh no well i got along with him along my way i went i began to proceed to move on because i was about to the basis pentecostal boy at work one time told me you know was talking about the the things of the bible and different things like that and i said well that's not right and he said well that's what i believe i said well i'm glad you said it that's like you know that's what you believe because i don't believe it you know i believe just what i'm trying to get you to see because i'm backing it up all the way through the bible going back even to the old testament to read that psalmist to where he says he would come and descend and receive gifts and see that's exactly what he'd done on the day of pentecost he ascended on high and he'd come back the next you know a few days there come when the upper room experienced the time he came back in the baptism of the holy ghost in those people that made god manifested in a human form that was meant to be what about it like i'm saying about that man he said i'm not working at pentecost he said i'm not working on commanding uh the devil he said no you're not he's no no he said i'm working on commanding god i said he said yeah i said the bible says command you me i said it don't say for you to tell him how to do it it's not you commanding god if you're accepting what god has said about it and believing it and standing on what god has said you see why can't we be that way because if it is true i'm basing in this life few comments on this one thing if you believe this end time message truly believe it then you have to believe that there was just one prophet to come in the end time it was one message there was one being and we don't need all of these running around the country claiming to be another prophet you know brother branham but we can have the five-fold ministry that can walk in the in the shoe heels of the man that brought it to us and believe what he said and he'll answer the questions i always wondered during the scriptures wanted it said it in revelation you know but it said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he's they'll begin to sound and all that i used to wonder about that we had a meeting one day on on the fifo ministry people talking and trying and i tried my best to show them a little something in that and uh the brother later coming up the road he said i've never seen you so down and out i said well what do you mean i said i told them brothers the truth and even read them thus saith the lord from the prophet and they wouldn't believe it i said i don't understand why they don't want to believe it but in the day and when it did it hit me why does it say that the days of the voice of several things but why does it put a butt in there like that that's over in chapter 10 right can't you see the end of chapter 3 that there was a prophet to come right chapter 3 to the 3 14 beginning of the creation of god a prophet was to come and john is told to bring forth what god has given to him and he gives each church his place these times laying it down and then he gets over here and he's standing there and he said well in other words john was saying i can't go any further because i don't have anything for it to go to and it rung inside of him but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel his mind went back to chapter three and our stood brother branham as the angel of the lady of seeing not just church itself but to the church to the bride but in the days of the voice that when that man would bring the message to you and i we'd receive that message and be able to walk therein but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel be church god will do things for us if we'll let him i have been accused of being everything in the book from the know it all to everything you know and and it's the basis of saying well brother dale you're just you're just too smart ethnically you're just too arrogant you're too hateful one of these days you'll wish you'd never said that because one day you'll find out that what i tried to tell you is right then you'll have your problems you'll have to answer to god yourself but i've tried my best to take this message and break it down to the people that they could see jesus christ living the same in you and me and believing in a fivefold ministry for the perfecting of the saints to bring this message to the congregation but you know what the congregation has got to be the message you got your part we just got our part we're just doing what we can do to try to help you your part is to believe it come on musicians think on these things gifts and calling gifts and calling it comes right down to where we're standing and the hour that we're here and to believe the message and say my whole soul is sold out we saw old brother duret yesterday down at the funeral there i said looked at him and i said yep anchored my soul in melakafall most of you here are old enough to be able to been around for 30 40 years you know what i'm talking about they used to tell him to come on up and sing he'd always sang the same thing i've anchored my soul in malachi i don't have no other place for to be anchored i have no extras in case we don't make it i don't have a bank account in swiss to worry that we can house some money in case we need it i do believe the prophet's message but it's for the bride to receive that message and by way of the prophets and just remember one thing the reason i said that while ago do you realize what people are doing i want to say there's one statement somebody made a statement one time it might have been brother branham but it was not it was a good statement he said if you go against a prophet you know in some way you're going to face every prophet the spirit of that prophet is prevalent in every prophet so you're going to face every prophet well i don't believe that that brother branham taught paul correctly you're gonna face paul and brother branham the angels there of each one you're gonna face every prophet down through time so it ain't going to be a nice day it's our chance now to receive and believe it well pretty dale i believe the message all right i'm not asking you to turn cartwheels and and to do this out of that i'm asking you one thing can you put your whole life on what you've heard can you lay everything on what you've heard and lay it there correctly that we're not trying to build up anything or any man or any point we're just trying to tell the truth believe it let's stand together what do we got [Music] i claim the blood [Music] yes for me [Music] [Applause] [Music] god [Music] [Applause] [Music] 40 years ago he said that's the way god will judge you [Music] i went to him and i thanked him [Applause] for all that he'd done to help me to find jesus christ i came in the message had problems in a church [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but i went to that brother and i said i want to thank you for everything you've done to help me i said my whole heart is based on everything thank you for helping me my sickness because without that help we may have a lot of problems you just thank god for what he's done for you [Music] that's what i told him memorial yesterday i said brother ray had something that a lot of you people never will have everybody was just looking at all the believers and looking wondering what the world are gonna say i guess i told him i said he had an opportunity for me to be his pastor and i got to be his pastor for some 30 years i thank god i've enjoyed it i had a good time with him we always had a good relationship you see my concern is you we're trying to get you there i ain't worried about the rest of them anybody got a need [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] just blocks [Music] those precious [Music] anybody else i have a source of strength when i am weak that takes me through oh when life [Music] [Applause] [Music] a is [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus those precious is [Music] jesus all right let's just pray with him we give him a prayer cloth to bind all together with it and believe that god will reach down and touch the church and take care of things and mount him up to where he's supposed to be and put everything in the correct order all right father we believe your word we thank you what our brother's asking for we pray that you'll just take care of it and lord just let your grace and love be with him he just wants to stay with that word and that's our prayer we
