========================================

God bless you Saints good to be in the house of the Lord and I just want to say I thoroughly enjoy brother Michael's Sunday school lesson he's he's downstairs but he he'll listen later and hear this um I certainly want to just encourage him to keep pressing on um cuz that was wonderful and uh we've been listening in to the services at the camp and if you haven't I I encourage you to do that as well you can find those online and I I we've sure enjoyed um listening to brother Andrew Glover and and Josh Bennett and uh uh bring bring the word let's see is [Music] this there we go all right let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word this morning we just ask Lord that as we study these things out that you open them up to us Lord God and bless the services today Lord be with brother Wade as he's preparing to bring us the word today Lord Jesus and open up our hearts and our minds Lord to receive what you have in store for us today that you'll give us encouragement and strength we ask in your name amen now we're going through Hebrews chapter 13 and we're um getting towards entertaining strangers which is um a really interesting thing to study out and but before we get let's just kind of uh as as we kind of move on into that um verse three or four there let's back up a little bit and keep talking about Brotherly Love here cuz Paul says of course how we've been studying Paul is really the only one that that kind of strung those two words together brotherly and love and the way that he did nobody else really really mentions uh uses those two words Brotherly Love in the New Testament and Paul's saying let Brotherly Love continue be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares and if you really look at that that word brotherly love it means um uh it's it's the the original Greek is Philadelphia which means love of brothers or sisters the love which Christians cherish for each other as Brethren and so the love um you know when you just when you love somebody regardless of what their background is where they come from or what they've done to you or all of those things but you love them anyway now I've got over on the side here a picture of the just to illustrate that brother b or Jesus told the story of the good Samaran which really if you break that down that the you got the the the Levi and the priest walking away you think well the minister should the maybe sometimes the ones that you really expect would you know like in this story would would would help the Israelite that's falling down you're looking and and and maybe sometimes the ones that you would expect are walking away and Here Comes This Good Samaritan one uh a hybrid that everybody has looked down on that uh a mixed mixed race you know everybody is like what they they even put them in like a special area where nobody would fellowship with them the Samaritans nobody wanted to go over there that's why when Jesus went to to Samaria the the disciples were like where are we going to Samaria we're the Israelites don't go to Samaria but that is the example that Jesus used as somebody that was really showing kindness to somebody else the love of somebody um regardless of what the situation is and you know love is uh if you really start breaking it down it's almost something that um you know you look at it as kind of a strange thing like maybe the disciples looked over at John who kind of example of Love leaning his head on Jesus's breast and they would look at him and like that's that's that's different that's different for him to be leaning his head over on Jesus's breath and even you think about that scene when when Jesus and Peter and John were walking on the on the on the seashore and and Peter says what about this guy guy over here he's a little bit different and and Jesus says what is it to you what happens to him what is it to you if he terries till I come love is is a little bit it's a little bit different you think about supernatural love on display to respond in kindness no matter what the devil can throw no matter what people say it's got to be something Supernatural let's let's we what what John said in in 1 John chapter 4 he said beloved and I've got this picture of thorns being tossed at somebody that's watering them anyway that's what a maybe just consider this picture Thorns being thrown at you but you're just going to return kindness anyway look what John here says and and I know it's a little bit small to read but let's just just kind of meditate on these words as I read them beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God now now brother brand what he said God was originally a fountain of love his his attribute he was love and he said within himself with all these other attributes so when he was manifested the attribute of love in Earth the very attribute of Love of uh the very expression of love was manifested here in Earth you were part of that so when you are expressed that makes you also part of that expression of love that's what really John is trying to explain brother B expounded more on that but he said as we keep reading in verse 8 he said he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love and this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him here in his love not that we love God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another what's he saying if God loved us when we we were unlovable when we were in a predicament where we could we just um like I heard I heard uh somebody saying in a video I watched recently that a lot of these people that you read about in the Bible are people that you would not want to go you would not even want to fellowship with you would not want to sit down and eat at a table at the table with somebody who sold his go gave his wife away Abraham or like all these sto David what did you do you betrayed your your friend and you you uh you stole his wife and all these all these things where you look at it and these people how could you how could you love somebody that committed these horrible things but yet God loved us anyway you look at your own life how could God love me but yet God loved me anyway and that's the kind of love that we should Express to one another when we when it looks like we're unlovable I I I even heard uh I'm I know we don't like to I this is something that that James Dobson said years ago he said when you should love your kids is when they're the most unlovable that's when you really should love your kids is when they when they really you know get on your nerves and do things that you oh goodness that's when you pour out the love and really show him love beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another no man ha seen God at any time if we love one another if you want to see God love one another if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us now you think about love when when somebody does something like maybe just think about it in a like a marital situation your wife does something that really GRS on your nerves or vice versa but yet there's something that trumps all of that it it's something greater than that your your kids do something that really upset you maybe somebody in the church does something that you don't like but there's something greater than that that covers it over that's why the Bible says hatred stirreth up stries but love covers all sins love covers it all that's why you know maybe maybe your your husband will uh leave the shoes in a place that trips you up or won't clean up after himself or maybe you know you don't you forget to take the trash out or things things of life that aggravate but love love is there and love covers it all and see I've got this little image of the the scale of things being balanced out all the different animosities and things of life things that just aggravate but love balances the scale out and love is what covers it all over love that's why we got to have Brotherly Love Brotherly Love is the thing that can draw somebody back to Christ when you show them love when you show when you really show somebody that you care about them and that the expression of God's love is shown through your life that is God on the display now I've got uh my my next slide is a little picture of somebody showing love to to a dark cloud of you know cuz a lot of lot of times in life people you know they got complexes and all these kind of things that cause them to react in different ways and and you know you can get in this cycle that's what that's what brother Andrew was preaching on how how the older generation maybe they got complexes and things built up and they'll start treating the the younger generation parents a lot of times will do that they'll have complexes and they'll start piling it on the Next Generation and then it becomes a cycle you you got to get out of that cycle how you going to get out of that cycle is by love say I'm I'm I'm not going to perpetuate this thing I'm going to return love you can and and see that's why love it looks kind of strange looks like you'd say maybe well it's just some kind of sissified thing no no real Godly love on display am go Love Will Conquer everything love can change the atmosphere let let's let's get real for a second uh if you got like maybe a menopause a wife she's getting real upset she get real upset you come in and you say something hurtful back to her and and it'll just cause the situation to spiral out of control but if you react in love tell her how much you love her tell her how much you appreciate her it'll change everything love will change the whole thing think about that story brother R told where the the woman's drunk husband was coming home from partying with her friends and she just sitting there washing the floor saying must Jesus bear bear the cross alone and she maybe had a right to get up and yell and screaming at his face and tell him you ain't what kind of a role model are you and all this kind of stuff but love is what won him to Christ let Brotherly Love continue now we're growing up into love and I got you know we kind of talked about the stature of perfect man briefly let's just read this real quick I got the uh we're we're growing up one adding one thing on the other of patience and Temperance and all these things to where we come to a place where we can really treat somebody with love and kindness despite how they treat us in first pet second Peter chapter 1 verse4 he said whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises we got some promises promise a promise here laying in the Bible that we can behave just like Jesus that by these you might be protected ERS of the divine nature that you can have the same character of God expressed in your life having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity now what what's happening as you as you grow you begin to recognize that if God if God brought you through these things he's able to bring somebody else so you can have patience with them I I think real bloodly kindness is not you get do away with all that judging and where you're saying well look at look at you you ain't as good as I am and and all the judge pointing fingers and everything but you bear with one another knowing that if God brought you he's able to bring somebody else patience to know that God's working and he's doing it and if there's a problem in somebody's life they they can look in the beer of God's word and God will expose it to them God will reveal it but in our interactions with One Another Love covers so we can deal with one another even through all of our our little our our little problems of life and the things that little bumps in the road we deal with one another because Peter said well look what he says for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ now you think about how now as we go into the next verse the next scripture that Paul's saying how can I get these things a lot of times we'll think well I I messed up I I I goofed up I I've got a problem maybe I don't have patience the way I thought I should and we'll back up and say well I got to work on myself now think about that I got to work on myself is that right am I working on myself or is God the one doing it that's why brother Ram said that it's automatic this is not a self-help program when I go back and I try to I try to the Bible says that you cannot add one hair one you cannot add one little bit of stature by taking thought of it so when somebody points out a flaw and says you need to go work on yourself that's is that scriptural how what how as we go into the next verse Paul is trying to get us to say we need to understand that what's happening as you as you eat the word you become the word it's an automatic process you you're becoming it as so oh we we we must always have a positive conf confession that God is working on us and we're going somewhere and he's he's building a faith in us and like like he would say from that Faith within us is growing from a little Mustard Seed Faith to a marble Faith growing growing till this Mountainside Faith something is happening as we're eating the word don't ever have a negative confession and get so down and say well I I'm I'm nothing's happening you just keep eating the word and keep marching on and keep going now look look let me let me skip over that I'm we're talking about preaching of the Gospel in Ephesians 4:11 because Hebrews chapter 13:2 says be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares now if we go back the The Strangers we're talking about the preaching of the Gospel that is how we grow that's what Ephesians 4:11 says he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the Ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ now I've got a picture of somebody preaching I I think this is a scripture that we should all have memorized that we should all have just laying on our tongue ready to go that this is how we're going to grow through the preaching of the Gospel the word that we hear that's why Paul is saying be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares now as we as we really study this out think about what this is saying like strangers in the Bible Abraham sitting there and here comes three strangers walking up and what he did was he didn't say well uh y'all need to y'all need to go down the road to the 7-Eleven and find you some food some way somehow no he pulled all the stops out and he entertained everything that they were there to he of course we know we know the story he knew uh had a revelation of one God he knew who it was was he he he he wasn't confused about who was walking up but he he was ready to entertain the word for that day he knew he was coming he he he was ready to entertain and then the two angels they went down to uh they went down to Sodom and what did lot do he entertained The Strangers that were coming with a message and Genesis 19 it says There came two angels to Sodom and Evan and and and lot sat in the gate of Sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face towards the ground and he said behold now my lords turn in I pray you into your servant's house and tear all night and wash your feet and you shall rise up early and go on your ways and they said nay but we will abide in the street all night and he pressed upon them greatly he's ready to entertain them and they turned in unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat and as as the eagle stirreth brother Brown preach this he he's having a prayer line and this lady comes up and he says here come here lady and I put this in here just so we can kind of really meditate on the scripture what it saying he said you and I are strangers to one another you think God can tell me what your trouble is would it help you so now he's a stranger to her and she's a stranger to him and he's an angel a messenger a messenger with a message to her you think God can tell me what your trouble is would it help you would it help you all if God said something now to this woman it's your ear you believe that God will make it well you're scared it's a Cancer and it's in your left ear is that right well it was but it isn't now now and see how we're we're getting into what brother R's definition of entertaining strength ERS that somebody that you don't know but yet you recognize that they've got a message from God and you listen to it and you heed it and you're willing to pull out all the stops to get to get what they're bringing because Jesus said in Mark chapter n whosoever shall receive one of such children might be a stranger to you but if you receive them in my name they you receive Christ and whosoever shall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent me it Mark chapter n he said and said unto them whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great brother Brown preached and when their eyes were open he said as they went along he said to them why are you so sad talking about on the road to EMAs I wonder if he'd say the same thing to this little gathering here tonight why are you so sad what makes you so weary why they said are you just a stranger they didn't know him and you don't know who that is sitting right next to you tonight the Bible said we have entertained angels unaware God now here's where he really clenches it what it is God H sending his Spirit to an individual and that individual is a mouthpiece when you receive that individual you don't receive him but you receive him that sent him Jesus said when you receive me you receive not me but you receive my father that sent me you get it we laugh at a preacher sometime a good gospel preacher because he disagrees with our theology we make fun of him sometime and even call him that scandalous name of Holy Roller fanatic you don't know you might be talking about God when you do that for the Bible said in so much as you have done under the least of these little ones that believe in me you have done it unto me and these signs shall follow them that believe not all that say they believe but these signs shall follow them that leave and again he said in the message influence he said we notice today that because that people are have no reverence they'll come to church people will come to church and cut up and laugh and talk don't forget we're talking about entertaining strangers entertaining the word when it's brought to you and laugh and talk make fun sitting where the gospel is being preached no reverence at all and meet you on the street you don't expect any respects of people we mustn't do that but yet it shows Christian dignity to at least honor the people say good morning brother or whatever you wish some of them holler hello preach oh that's so common remember Jesus said as you do unto these you do it unto me he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me and he that receiveth him that I've sent receives him see as you do to them you have did it unto me and the irreverence you know what it is they are not conscience of the presence of God the world has become so common and religion has become such a lowb until there is no respects just as it's always been and then from that time I'm just I'm just reading a few quotes this afternoon or this morning he said so he was only 30 or two 30 or 32 years old and a young beautiful woman come up one day to the well where he was sitting tired and he said to her woman bring me a drink and she said it's not customary for you to ask me such things as that I am Samaritan you're a Jew segregation he said but if you knew who you were talking to what was that woman doing she was meeting God she met a man but it wasn't a man that she was meeting it was God in the man she was meeting God let that soak in the scripture said you've entertained angels not knowing what you were doing unaware of it same as Abraham entertained angels and immediately after the angel left and had performed a miracle before him he called the man God Elohim the almighty God sitting there eating steak sandwiches drinking milk from the cow eating cakes and he was almighty God the little woman little did she know look what had done for Abraham then it changed him and Sarah from an old woman old man and an old woman of a hundred years old back to a young man and woman that brought forth Isaac they met God that's what done the difference now you you see what he's saying there entertaining strangers is what will change your body entertaining strangers is what changed Abraham and Sarah because they they didn't recognize who that was coming up to them but when you when they believe the word it was coming forth it it just like that little that little sister that was coming up there on the prayer line and brother ad said we're strangers but she listened and she believed him and it brought healing in her body that's right that's that's why we need to entertain strangers now look what Paul is saying let Brotherly Love continue love one another despite all the problems of life just love one another let Brotherly Love continue let it keep going don't let it just be a one-time thing but love love love be not forgetful to entertain strangers cuz that's what's going to change us for thereby some have entertained angels unaware what a messenger somebody bringing you something from God to help you remember them that are in bonds as bound with them enter into one another's afflictions when somebody's sick and laying in the hospital now now we might not see one another's efforts as we pray in our prayer closet and those kind of things but when oh when you're praying and reaching out to God really enter into the situation and them which suffer adversities as being yourselves also in the body and then Paul says marriage is Honorable than all and the bed undefiled but but wh mongers and adulterers God will judge and well this might be a good place to stop and don't get worried I'm not going to linger overly on this scripture but Paul is definitely taking a stand against uh IM immorality in Galatians 519 he said now the works of the flesh are manifested which are these adultery fornication uncleanness naous and in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 he said know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor feminite nor abusers of themselves and he gives his list because we know Paul loved list he loved making lists in verse 11 he said such were some of you in other words the gospel is going to change you you're not going to stay in that same situation because like brother BR said adulterers adulterers go to hell there's a consequence for immorality God wants to take your life and change you and make you different and not leave you in that condition that's why he said such were some of you that that might might be a past condition but when the gospel gets a hold of your life it'll change you but ye are washed but ye are Sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God John MacArthur I was just finding some quotes about immorality he said this is a nation so far down in the sewer of immorality and wickedness that nothing surprises me but you let the gospel get a hold of somebody and they won't be like that anymore regardless Billy Graham said regardless of what society says we can't go on much longer in the sea of immorality without judgment coming that's what Paul's getting at here in marriage is Honorable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge so while we'll end on this next scripture from First Corinthians flee run away from that thing flee from sexual immorality the Bible the King James version says fornication every other sin a person commits is outside the body but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body and we'll stop there on that weighty scripture God bless you [Applause] Saints for [Music]
