[0:00] to me everybody everybody good to be in
[0:05] the house of the Lord
[0:06] Bill the week yeah they everybody's
[0:12] doing somewhat social distancing but
[0:16] good to be here I need to make a little
[0:18] announcement and kind of clarify
[0:19] something I said sandy and also I want
[0:21] to read what brother Dale wants y'all to
[0:24] know so everybody this whole line the
[0:27] comment I made Sunday is the reason we
[0:29] want people here that's gonna be here
[0:32] for both services on Sunday I'm talking
[0:34] about inside the building not outside
[0:35] but I'm going to read you what brother
[0:37] Dale that's suggesting us to do and I
[0:41] agree with it 1,000% so I'll just tell
[0:45] you what I meant if you're not gonna be
[0:46] in both services then we're not going to
[0:49] have you here on Sunday because we have
[0:52] 12 people and then half of you leave and
[0:54] then there's six people sitting in here
[0:56] now I don't care if you that doesn't
[0:58] bother me if you don't want to listen to
[1:01] me that's your problem
[1:02] but brother Dale says we need to be
[1:04] Church like we're supposed to be a
[1:06] church one no this is going on and I'm
[1:08] gonna read you what he says this is
[1:09] suggestion not a demand everybody hear
[1:13] their suggestion not a demand to come on
[1:16] Sunday and sit in your car for the time
[1:19] being because I'm like brother Dale what
[1:22] would you be doing on Sunday anyway what
[1:23] are y'all doing now you you're not
[1:25] coming to church but you'll go to
[1:26] Walmart
[1:27] you'll go eat you'll go to your family's
[1:29] house well I think you need to be in
[1:32] church and if we can't be in the
[1:33] building you at least need to be outside
[1:35] this is from brother Dale Wade will also
[1:38] allow some to come and then we're gonna
[1:40] talk about that in a second inside as we
[1:43] go forward but like I said Sunday if
[1:46] you're not gonna be at both services
[1:48] inside inside
[1:52] don't come okay we don't want to get set
[1:56] on the wrong set of things and not be
[2:00] I mean his dutchess question what would
[2:02] we do if this had not happened what are
[2:04] you going to be doing you should be in
[2:05] church right you should be doing what
[2:08] you're supposed to be doing on Sunday I
[2:11] think maybe
[2:13] and I'm gonna just say this it this is
[2:15] the shaking time for the bride it's
[2:16] gonna tell you who the bride is and
[2:18] who's not we won't have to have built on
[2:21] teryn sighs you were right we won't have
[2:22] to build it on the church because
[2:23] they'll be probably some disappear from
[2:26] the church anyway that won't come back
[2:27] when everything comes back together
[2:28] because you get to set on I like what
[2:31] brother Joe Canada said a few minutes
[2:32] ago he treats Sunday when he's at home
[2:35] it's just like church for him that kids
[2:37] are not running around in the house
[2:38] they're not sitting around eating ice
[2:41] cream and watching the service they're
[2:43] raising their hands they're clapping
[2:45] their hands they're singing the songs
[2:46] and they're participating in the service
[2:49] that's what you should do because listen
[2:50] we are human beings and we are routine
[2:55] we have a routine you get out of that
[2:58] routine you got a problem so he wants to
[3:03] encourage all of us to put our thoughts
[3:06] and our hearts set on serving God at
[3:08] this time not worrying about the virus
[3:11] but we're going to participate as the
[3:13] best we can even when they start opening
[3:15] this up a little bit we're still going
[3:18] to watch what we're doing we're still
[3:22] gonna be diligent we've still need to
[3:23] wash our hands we still need to try to
[3:25] be the six feet apart if you're sick
[3:27] don't come if your kids are sick don't
[3:31] come okay don't come to church I mean
[3:34] they let you off for two weeks at work
[3:36] now if you just have a sniffle
[3:38] so it's killing us at the post office
[3:41] you know though them people like I feel
[3:43] like I got it and you get two weeks off
[3:45] you just become listen this is going to
[3:47] show who the real people are this is
[3:49] going to show who the real church goers
[3:53] are going to just go to church and then
[3:55] disappear so and I hate that but it's a
[3:58] trying time now we should serve God the
[4:01] best we can and and put forth an effort
[4:06] even though you're not in the building
[4:09] that's brother down said it's a
[4:11] suggestion not a demand come on Sunday
[4:13] and sit in your car for the time being
[4:15] and listen to the services because he
[4:18] wants you to participate as best you can
[4:22] and we don't want to get set on the
[4:24] wrong thing
[4:25] and I'm like him let me ask you one more
[4:28] time what would you be doing if this not
[4:32] happened this has now become an excuse
[4:37] for you can go and leave after first
[4:38] service or well some of you do anyway
[4:40] so it's just an excuse so it just grows
[4:46] bigger as week as we get toward the
[4:48] headstone that's gonna it's gonna make
[4:51] now not wins the brother Nelson now wins
[4:53] these is we know how it is with work and
[4:55] all those different things but Wednesday
[4:57] we are going to this is what I'm gonna
[5:00] do on Sundays we're gonna start allowing
[5:02] more to come but men we still want to
[5:06] hang with the men we've talked about we
[5:08] still want to keep the men coming if
[5:11] you're a but now don't come just one
[5:14] service if you're not gonna come inside
[5:18] for two services tell me you can't be
[5:20] here into stir for two services and you
[5:22] won't come on side because somebody
[5:24] wants to come to church and they're
[5:27] taking you're taking up their spot by
[5:28] just being like two days ago and going
[5:31] home so that comes from the pastor and
[5:34] the assistant also we just feel that we
[5:37] don't want the devil the devil's already
[5:39] got out the world all upset and scared
[5:42] and everything else we just need to be
[5:43] diligent we need to be observant and but
[5:46] we still need to worship God
[5:48] we still need to worship God like we
[5:50] always have and even more and as the day
[5:53] approaches we're supposed to be even
[5:57] I'll tell this on brother Tony Smallwood
[5:58] he's not here I called him today I said
[6:01] you want to come and of course he called
[6:02] me brought back he said I'll be there
[6:03] son he's like really gay there Sunday so
[6:06] you got some people that are eager to
[6:07] come so if you're not gonna come both
[6:08] services inside the building please let
[6:12] me know because if you don't show up
[6:14] second service like brother down said
[6:17] that linköping goes you won't be coming

[8:22] night greet you out there in radioland
[8:26] sitting in your each of your little home
[8:30] home churches tonight oh we're this I
[8:35] know this is a this is an interesting
[8:36] setup but we're making the best of it
[8:40] let's go ahead and turn on over to
[8:42] Isaiah chapter 6 and and before we go
[8:46] into that let's just go to the Lord in
[8:48] prayer we think you look God to be able
[8:51] to gather together once again Lord Jesus
[8:53] around your word and maybe not all of us
[8:55] are in one place tonight or Jesus but
[8:57] we're gathering together around around
[8:59] the fresh-killed tonight just the same
[9:01] and I pray God a tonight Lord you let
[9:04] something be said to help your people
[9:06] Lord Jesus and to strengthen their faith
[9:07] and to encourage little God and and
[9:09] maybe to convict the heart of the people
[9:11] that that are not quite right yet Lord
[9:13] Jesus granite Lord God that you'll just
[9:15] be with us all Lord God as we as we
[9:17] worship in our different places and look
[9:20] into your word tonight we pray that
[9:22] you'll come and quicken that we welcome
[9:23] we welcome your presence now into our
[9:26] into that where our different places
[9:29] Lord wherever we are Lord Jesus we
[9:31] welcome you tonight and open up the
[9:32] doors of our heart Lord Jesus that you
[9:34] may be welcome Lord we ask these these
[9:36] blessings on the reading of your word
[9:38] and your name amen
[9:41] so tonight I want to speak on the topic
[9:45] of the influence of two kings and just
[9:48] look at Isaiah chapter six which is a
[9:51] familiar little scripture to us and
[9:54] maybe just take tonight to do just kind
[9:57] of a little Bible study and look into
[10:00] some things here so it says in Isaiah
[10:04] chapter six and the year that King
[10:06] Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting
[10:08] upon a throne high lifted up and his
[10:11] train filled the temple above us to the
[10:14] seraphim's each one had six wings with
[10:17] twain he covered his face and with twain
[10:19] he covered his feet and with twain he
[10:21] did fly and one cried unto another and
[10:24] said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts
[10:27] the whole earth is full of his glory and
[10:28] the post of the door moved at the
[10:31] voice of him that cried and the house
[10:32] was filled with smoke then said I o is
[10:36] me for I am undone because I am a man of
[10:40] unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of
[10:43] a people of unclean lips for mine eyes
[10:45] have seen the king the Lord of hosts
[10:48] then flew one of the seraphim's unto me
[10:50] having a live coal in his hand which he
[10:52] had taken with the tongs from off the
[10:54] altar and he laid it upon my mouth and
[10:57] said lo this has touched our lips and
[10:59] dine iniquity is taken away and I sin
[11:02] purged also I heard the voice of the
[11:04] Lord saying whom shall I send and who
[11:06] will go for us then said I here am I
[11:09] send me you may be seated the Lord and
[11:12] his blessing to the reading of the work
[11:14] so tonight I I'm basically gonna be
[11:18] preaching reap reaching the messages
[11:20] influence so that brother Branham
[11:21] preached many many times you know I
[11:24] can't think of any greater compliment
[11:27] somebody to give me than to say that
[11:29] you're preaching exactly what brother
[11:31] Randall preached so and you know burr
[11:34] Brown you know he would give a big old
[11:36] nugget to us and I believe the fivefold
[11:38] ministry will take that and kind of
[11:40] break it down into easily digestible
[11:42] chunks so that people can kind of get
[11:44] what he's saying and maybe this was
[11:45] tonight we'll encourage you to go back
[11:47] and listen to that those messages again
[11:49] and maybe hope Lord willing and a
[11:52] renewed understanding and and and take
[11:55] the things that he said more personally
[11:57] and try to apply them to your life
[11:59] because really what what that message is
[12:03] that the sermons influence when he
[12:05] begins to lay it out he's really talking
[12:08] about there's two kings there that he's
[12:10] he's presenting it there in the sermon
[12:12] and the one the one King as an earthly
[12:14] King Uzziah and and if you look at 2nd
[12:17] chronicles
[12:18] just real quick we'll read through some
[12:20] of those scriptures that he talked about
[12:21] well you can you can brother Branham
[12:24] laid down the background of Uzziah how
[12:26] he was a shepherd boy and when he was
[12:27] sixteen year old years old is dead his
[12:30] dad died and he became King and he was
[12:32] put into a position of authority and he
[12:34] started off the race really good he
[12:36] began to seek the Lord and he saw God's
[12:38] guidance and and he the Lord prospered
[12:42] him and he began to really
[12:44] quickening him all these things that he
[12:48] built great engines of like siege
[12:49] engines on the walls and things that
[12:51] that normal people wouldn't conceive oh
[12:53] but God blessed him and caused him to
[12:55] have an understanding of how to do these
[12:57] things so let's just kind of read in the
[13:00] second chronicles chapter 26 verse 5
[13:02] real quick and he says he saw God in the
[13:04] days of Zechariah who had understanding
[13:06] in the visions of God and as long as he
[13:08] saw the Lord God made him to prosper as
[13:11] long as he saw God God made him to
[13:12] prosper and then and then moving on down
[13:15] to verse 8 it says the ammonites gave
[13:17] gift is he gifts to use ayuh
[13:19] and his name spread abroad even to the
[13:22] entering end of Egypt for he
[13:24] strengthened himself exceedingly and in
[13:27] other words God was allowing him to just
[13:28] prosper and spread out and he was with
[13:30] him
[13:31] moreover as I built towers in Jerusalem
[13:33] at the corner gate and at the Vala gate
[13:35] and at the turning of the wall and
[13:36] fortified them also he built towers in
[13:39] the desert and dig many wells free
[13:41] getting much cattle both in the low
[13:42] country and in the plains husbandmen
[13:45] also in vine dressers in the mountains
[13:46] and in Carmel for he loved husbandry and
[13:49] he had vines vines growing everywhere
[13:51] fruit but just plentiful all these
[13:53] things coming out of the of his the work
[13:56] of his hands because God had caused him
[13:58] to bless it to be blessed and it says in
[14:01] verse 15 and he made in Jerusalem
[14:03] engines these are the siege engines I
[14:05] was talking about invented by cunning
[14:06] men to be on the towers and upon the
[14:08] bulwarks to shoot arrows in great stones
[14:11] with him and his name spread far abroad
[14:14] for he was marvelously hilt till he was
[14:16] strong could you imagine the people in
[14:18] that day looking at all these siege
[14:20] engines that he had built to hurl arrows
[14:22] and I'm sure they weren't just a little
[14:23] teeny-weeny a big old big old errors
[14:26] that were shoot out from the wall like
[14:27] maybe with a tree trunk almost with
[14:31] something sharp on the end it just bust
[14:33] through a wall or whatever and the
[14:36] people in that day we're probably
[14:38] looking with amazement there how could
[14:40] this man come up with a design the
[14:42] architectural design that the the plans
[14:45] for something like this it was all
[14:46] because God was with him and but it it
[14:50] says in verse 16 but when he was strong
[14:52] his heart was lifted up to his distress
[14:55] for he transgressed against the Lord is
[14:57] God and went into the temple of the Lord
[14:59] to burn incense upon the altar of
[15:02] incense you see use I as a cautionary
[15:06] tale to all of us because he began as
[15:09] long as he sought the glory God made him
[15:11] to prosper that then he began to look at
[15:13] his earthly accomplishments and he
[15:16] started to be lifted up in other words
[15:18] he was looking at all the things that he
[15:20] had done and let's apply to today's
[15:22] today's life he began to look in the
[15:24] mirror of Facebook and Instagram and all
[15:28] these things and begin to admire himself
[15:30] he began to look at what what the
[15:32] position he had may be today we've got
[15:35] many ministers today that but the God
[15:37] blesses them at their beginning of their
[15:38] ministry but then they begin to look at
[15:40] how God had prosper them and and then
[15:42] they fall by the wayside and they begin
[15:44] to get lifted up but you see because you
[15:46] SIA was influenced by the wrong thing
[15:49] and that's the point of the whole
[15:51] message of influence is before you can
[15:53] influence somebody else you need to make
[15:55] sure that you are influenced by the
[15:57] correct thing when you're influenced by
[16:00] the correct thing then you could
[16:02] influence others now Isaiah was watching
[16:04] all this he was watching the life of
[16:06] Uzziah and he was also influenced
[16:09] influenced by Uzziah so that's the whole
[16:12] point of this message also is that
[16:13] Isaiah being a prophet of God was yet
[16:17] caught in be it by being influenced by
[16:20] the wrong thing you see you can begin to
[16:23] get lifted up within your own self and
[16:25] say well well I'm a message believer I'm
[16:28] there we don't understand the mysteries
[16:30] of the Son of Man and all these things
[16:31] you can begin to get lifted up within
[16:33] yourself and then finally all of a
[16:35] sudden you've you've lost your humidity
[16:37] you lost your reverence you're no longer
[16:39] in action and you're falling by the
[16:41] wayside you see you've got to be
[16:44] influenced by the right thing
[16:48] so so Uzziah was an earthly king and and
[16:52] we don't want to have earthly influences
[16:53] because first John chapter 2 says love
[16:56] and not the world neither the things
[16:57] that are in the world
[16:58] If any man love the world the love of
[17:01] the father is not in it for all that is
[17:05] in the world the lust of the flesh and
[17:07] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[17:08] life is not of the Father but is of the
[17:11] world and the world passeth away and the
[17:14] lust thereof but he that doeth the will
[17:17] of God abideth for ever and now you say
[17:20] yeah well how are we how could we get
[17:23] distracted and and follow after like an
[17:25] earthly king well there there's many
[17:27] things
[17:28] there's many just ways for the devil to
[17:30] distract you to looking at the earthly
[17:32] influences instead of the influences of
[17:35] the of the heavenly king now that's the
[17:38] second King I want to talk about because
[17:39] there's a there's an earthly king and
[17:41] there's a heavenly king and it's so easy
[17:43] to be influenced by the earthly king
[17:45] because the devil whoa he's got a
[17:47] conduit right into your mind through the
[17:49] television and the movies and things
[17:51] that you watch and Facebook and you can
[17:53] get all called up and stuff that you
[17:55] read no WorldNetDaily or all this stuff
[17:58] that all it does is cause you
[18:00] consternation and trouble in your mind
[18:02] but if you can get piped into that
[18:04] influence of their heavenly king that
[18:06] you'll be in the right channel to have
[18:08] your your mind transformed to have your
[18:10] thinking transform to have peace and
[18:13] love and joy and all those things that
[18:15] come from that conduit of the perfect
[18:18] influence that heavenly influence and in
[18:22] Philippians 3:3 it says for we are the
[18:24] circumcision which worship God and the
[18:27] spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and
[18:29] have no confidence in the flesh in other
[18:33] words we can't have confidence that
[18:35] anything that we see with our eyes we
[18:38] can't have confidence and any man that
[18:40] we fellowship with we can't have
[18:42] confidence in anything in this world the
[18:44] only thing that we can have confidence
[18:46] in is
[18:47] Jesus Christ so I would have saved
[18:51] tonight uh Oh God let me now have
[18:53] confidence in my job or in my boss or in
[18:57] the Social Security system or in any
[19:00] vein work of man's hand let my
[19:02] confidence meet not be and Donald Trump
[19:05] or Joseph Biden or anybody anybody
[19:08] that's in the political system my
[19:09] confidence is not in those things
[19:11] tonight my confidence is in Jesus Christ
[19:14] if you can get connected to that
[19:17] heavenly realm of influence then you'll
[19:19] not be influenced by the things of this
[19:21] earth you'll not be swayed like a reed
[19:23] tossed to and fro and wondering what
[19:26] you're doing here wondering what what
[19:28] where your security lies my confidence
[19:31] is in Jesus Christ and and that alone
[19:33] that's where my inch where my insurance
[19:36] policies light laid up that's where all
[19:38] of my I don't have a backup system
[19:40] he is my only system he's the only thing
[19:43] that I put all my ducks in one pot I put
[19:46] all my eggs in one basket everything is
[19:49] laid up in Jesus Christ listen my
[19:54] confidence is not being a good person or
[19:56] or just because I've got a Bible in my
[19:59] home or a cloud sticker on my car or
[20:01] I've got message books on my bookshelves
[20:03] my confidence is in Jesus Christ and in
[20:06] Jesus Christ alone you know so many
[20:11] times will will end up will end up doing
[20:14] like news I and start with Isaiah and
[20:17] we'll start looking at somebody else for
[20:19] our confidence we'll fight we'll try to
[20:21] find an excuse to be the way they are
[20:24] because of something else that we're
[20:25] looking at I'll say Isaiah I might have
[20:27] said well I you know Hughes is a good
[20:30] point and that's that's you know many
[20:33] times the young people will come to the
[20:34] older ones and say well I see any these
[20:37] people over here doing something that I
[20:40] don't understand why I can't do like
[20:43] they're doing or or they'll even come
[20:45] back and say well you did such is such a
[20:48] thing when you were younger but you see
[20:50] you can't look at other people for your
[20:53] example the only example that we have is
[20:56] the Word of God is Jesus
[20:58] Christ Jesus is the word so we're not
[21:00] looking to find an excuse or a loophole
[21:02] and look to see what somebody else has
[21:04] done or find a way to get away get to
[21:07] get around the Word of God but we're
[21:09] looking we're looking for the influence
[21:11] of the word don't look for earthly
[21:14] influences don't look for an excuse to
[21:16] act the way that you do don't look for
[21:18] an excuse to look to lay MC and I just
[21:20] continue to wall around in the muck and
[21:22] the mire of the word but look to get out
[21:25] of that mess to get out of the condition
[21:27] that you're in to escape the bondage of
[21:29] the devil that the trap of the devil
[21:31] believes God is the veil of your eyes
[21:33] let the veil be lifted so that you can
[21:36] see plainly like the vision that Isaiah
[21:39] set saw and we'll get to in a minute
[21:40] when Isaiah saw a vision that had made
[21:43] everything different it for him
[21:45] when I was they began to step into
[21:47] another realm and see the supernatural
[21:48] it it changed the atmosphere it changed
[21:51] it changed the situation the second
[21:55] Corinthians chapter 3 it says in such
[21:57] trust have we through Christ to God
[21:59] words not that we are sufficient of
[22:02] ourselves to think anything as of
[22:04] ourselves but our sufficiency is of God
[22:07] our sufficiency is in him not and of
[22:10] ourselves are not not even in our church
[22:13] not even in our ministers not even in
[22:16] one another but it is only in Jesus
[22:18] Christ and the message life brother
[22:23] Branham said her brother was testifying
[22:25] him to me this morning he said he was
[22:26] called to the ministry when the little
[22:28] boy and then he failed he said and he
[22:30] said but then he came back with more of
[22:32] a call to preach than ever before you
[22:36] see what it was when he become a
[22:37] Christian he got in the wrong
[22:39] environment that imagine that now not
[22:42] see you see Isaiah was a prophet of God
[22:45] but then he began to look at the wrong
[22:48] he began to look at something that was
[22:49] an incorrect influence a Christian
[22:52] sitting here tonight or maybe sitting at
[22:53] home wherever you are you can be a
[22:55] Christian aborning and Christian and
[22:57] begin to look at the wrong thing and
[22:59] begin to get sucked into the wrong
[23:00] influence and he said see in that
[23:04] environment influenced in you seeing you
[23:06] just keep holding around with that kind
[23:09] of environment that influence
[23:10] is you I hope you're reading between the
[23:13] lines what I'm saying see it influences
[23:15] you in that environment and the first
[23:16] thing you know you become a part of that
[23:18] environment
[23:19] you go into it and just like a good
[23:22] clean man that's clean and moral and he
[23:25] begins to associate with a bunch of
[23:26] people who's not see you take up the
[23:29] spirit of that you take up the spirit of
[23:32] people at you that's why even in the
[23:34] world they say you should be around
[23:36] people that won't that you want to be
[23:39] like look like that will lift you up in
[23:41] the business world of whatever you don't
[23:43] you know if you want to be a successful
[23:44] business person you don't get around a
[23:47] bunch of losers that
[23:48] all they do is sit at home playing video
[23:50] games and eating Cheetos you you get
[23:53] around people that that there are have
[23:55] the right will have the right kind of
[23:56] influence on you and the same thing in
[23:58] the gospel you want to be around their
[24:00] kind of people that have will have the
[24:01] right kind of influence you know how can
[24:04] I be an influence as a Christian that
[24:07] might be a good question to ask enough
[24:08] tonight and many times people will
[24:10] respond to that question without what I
[24:12] got to do something I got to run around
[24:15] and do all these things do you know the
[24:17] way to be the right kind of influence as
[24:20] the Christian is to just find your place
[24:22] and get in it and stay there do you know
[24:25] the moon is in its place and it has a
[24:27] great influence on the earth as it moves
[24:29] through through this through its cycles
[24:31] its pulling all these tons of water from
[24:34] one side of the earth to the other and
[24:36] all it's doing is staying in its place
[24:39] it doesn't have to run to and fro to do
[24:41] that all he has to do is just finish in
[24:43] this place and it's doing what God told
[24:46] it to do it's just right there in its
[24:48] place the same thing with the Sun and
[24:50] all the other planets there they're not
[24:52] hustling to and fro and trying to you
[24:54] know you know going backwards and
[24:56] forwards they're in their place and
[24:57] their God their predestinated to orbit
[25:00] that God has put them in and they don't
[25:02] have to get out of their orbit to
[25:03] fulfill the plan that God had given them
[25:05] all they have to do is stay in their
[25:07] place and tonight that's what all you
[25:09] have to do is to fulfill the Word of God
[25:10] has find your place and stay in it and
[25:13] you might think that well I I don't
[25:15] think my place is very big I wonder if
[25:18] maybe
[25:18] that's what something Steven thought
[25:19] when just you say just a little deacon
[25:22] hey never had a great worldwide ministry
[25:24] to thing but his life was an example
[25:27] that Paul saw and led him to Christ
[25:29] because he looked at the life of Steven
[25:31] a little deacon there in a church that
[25:33] had a greater testimony than many
[25:35] worldwide ministers that you see today a
[25:37] little man that just stayed in this
[25:39] place tonight you can I want to say this
[25:41] too as encouragement to all the
[25:43] ministers all the ones here what do you
[25:45] think that people you don't have an
[25:46] influence to others when you think that
[25:48] maybe you look and see people leaving
[25:49] and it looks like people don't want to
[25:51] hear anything you've got to say all
[25:53] you've got to do to be an influence is
[25:55] stay in your place and God will use you
[25:57] exactly the way you want you to eat to
[25:59] be used God wants us to find our places
[26:03] stay in it
[26:07] you know if you could imagine as a
[26:12] looking at the scene unfold is as he saw
[26:14] use I get out of his place a king
[26:17] wanting to be a priest and Isaiah might
[26:19] have reacted like many of us do when we
[26:22] see people getting out of their place
[26:24] could you imagine as he heard that you
[26:26] you mean he took the censer and he tried
[26:30] to offer and since on the gun what was
[26:33] he thinking well he went into the into
[26:36] the temple and and if you read the story
[26:38] all of the pre I was it was about fifty
[26:41] priests or so that they crossed their
[26:43] arms and said no you can't come into
[26:44] here and use I began to argue with them
[26:46] and fuss and and he and he took a match
[26:49] or whatever it was they used in life the
[26:51] golden censer and that's when leprosy
[26:53] struck him because leprosy represents
[26:55] sin all those ministers were there
[26:57] telling him you can't do this you're out
[27:00] of your place he was out you see why the
[27:03] ministers are shouting at people to get
[27:06] in their place because if you're in your
[27:07] place you can be at influence and when
[27:10] you're out of your place you become a
[27:11] stumbling block
[27:13] that's why brother Branham said without
[27:14] these virtues you become a stumbling
[27:16] block without if you see a Christian
[27:19] that's not in their place it just trips
[27:20] everybody up somebody that doesn't have
[27:22] tempers and patience not I'm not able to
[27:25] just deal patiently with people and not
[27:27] able to deal with Shepherds all it
[27:29] becomes
[27:30] is God really on the scene so Isaiah
[27:36] looked at that and he saw the situation
[27:38] where he's I wouldn't listen to the
[27:40] priests and they were physically
[27:42] preventing him from burning in zips and
[27:44] then leprosy came on the scene and and
[27:47] struck him because that leprosy is a
[27:49] type of sin and you know what sin is
[27:51] well let's back up a second and just
[27:53] take a look at sin seeing is unbelief
[27:57] the product of unbelief is all of the
[28:00] things that you do all of the the word
[28:02] lipstick in the makeup and the adultery
[28:05] and the fornication and this smoking pot
[28:06] and at all of us looking at pornography
[28:08] and all those things but all those
[28:10] things emanate from the deeper the root
[28:12] of the problem is unbelief unbelief is
[28:15] the problem and unbelief when he
[28:17] disbelieved when he pushed back at the
[28:20] ministers that the priests that were
[28:21] there telling him that when he was wrong
[28:23] leprosy struck upon his face because he
[28:27] wouldn't believe and the message
[28:30] influence program said now you say well
[28:33] what do you mean leprosy represents a
[28:35] tight brother of sin and when a man
[28:37] won't stand correction by the word of
[28:39] God he is full of leprosy blows up and
[28:42] carries on what does you what do you do
[28:45] you ruin your influence see something
[28:48] happens people knows and can tell the
[28:49] word that you're corrected by that
[28:51] you're not going to do it
[28:53] therefore you ruin your influence and it
[28:56] hurt this fellow anger got on him and
[28:58] will read on down when he was corrected
[29:00] then he refused to take his correction
[29:02] because his social standing had become
[29:05] more to him than the Word of God had
[29:07] become I'm sure you understand what I'm
[29:09] driving at see you become more to him
[29:11] his position as king become more to him
[29:15] than the Word of God now see us is so
[29:20] important to see all these little
[29:21] problems and things with with Uzziah as
[29:23] we get into the depth of this message
[29:25] that we're studying here because all of
[29:28] these problems his lack of reverence his
[29:30] lack of humility his lack of action or
[29:33] all things that brother Bartlett brings
[29:35] out when Isaiah saw this vision there in
[29:38] the temple then Isaiah got a picture of
[29:41] what real worship is
[29:44] and Isaiah chapter 6 verse 1 it says in
[29:47] the year that King Uzziah died I saw
[29:49] also the Lord sitting upon a throne high
[29:53] and lifted up and his train filled the
[29:55] temple you see the predicament that that
[29:58] Isaiah saw Uzziah in that he was struck
[30:01] with leprosy that he ran from the temple
[30:03] and was never allowed back into the
[30:05] temple with worship he had to live in a
[30:07] little safe house for the rest of his
[30:09] life a little house he was quarantined
[30:11] for the rest of his life and could not
[30:13] come back into fellowship with it with
[30:15] the believers and brother Brahim said
[30:16] that that put Isaiah to his knees and he
[30:19] began to call out to God what is going
[30:21] on he began to call out from to God for
[30:24] for the I believe something inside of
[30:27] him was crying out for the right kind of
[30:29] influence because he had had his eyes on
[30:31] this wrong kind of influence for so long
[30:33] that now he needed he needed a
[30:35] corrective action in his life and so God
[30:38] came on the scene and gave him a vision
[30:40] he opened up a vision to him
[30:42] you'll see his brother branham ladies
[30:44] this message now first he saw a vision
[30:46] then he made his confession then he was
[30:49] cleansed and then he was commissioned
[30:52] and you see that plan laid out in this
[30:55] message that is the same plan that you
[30:57] have to follow in your own life you
[31:00] cannot make a confession unless you see
[31:03] the vision and I don't mean a vision
[31:05] like like like brother Brennan saw
[31:07] although you know that it could be
[31:09] possible that people now in this day see
[31:11] a vision but that is not the type of
[31:13] vision that I'm seeing I'm talking about
[31:15] I'm talking about a vision where the
[31:17] veil of what unbelief is lifted from
[31:20] over your eyes and you see Jesus Christ
[31:22] as he hears the word unveiled plainly
[31:25] before you listen if you've tonight I
[31:27] have gone through a born-again
[31:29] experience you know exactly what I'm
[31:31] talking about when the veil is lifted
[31:33] you know what I mean when the veil is
[31:35] lifted from your eyes because you've
[31:36] been there and if you and you've
[31:37] experienced it if you don't know what it
[31:40] is to have the layer lifted from your
[31:41] eyes then there's a good there's an
[31:43] altar tonight where you can come and
[31:45] confess your sins and have that veil
[31:47] lifted from over your eyes whether
[31:48] you're here in this church or home and
[31:50] your own home or the
[31:52] with their own little altar beside your
[31:53] bed tonight your that does the way is
[31:56] made plain the way is clear for you to
[31:59] come and confess your sins that God can
[32:01] lift that veil and and and make plain
[32:04] show you the vision of himself the kind
[32:07] the kind of vision that Isaiah saw that
[32:10] changed his life where he he began to
[32:12] understand what real worship was he
[32:15] began to see what a real communion with
[32:18] God was when he saw the seraphim's and
[32:20] he saw this things unfolded before his
[32:23] eyes then he knew what a real godly
[32:26] influence was what it was to have a real
[32:29] influence unfold before his eyes listen
[32:32] if you want to be a real influence to
[32:35] others you've got to have that kind of
[32:37] influence backing you up that kind of
[32:39] influence that back up the life of
[32:41] Isaiah brother brems said in the
[32:48] handwriting on the wall he said because
[32:52] you know you know what influences
[32:55] tonight
[32:56] you know what the influence is today the
[32:59] influence of the hour is the Gospel
[33:02] message the gospel being preached
[33:04] received in the heart of the believer is
[33:06] the influence the message the influence
[33:09] that I'm talking about is they weren't
[33:11] they manifested word of your day the
[33:14] word that we've heard is just not some
[33:16] something that somebody's concocted or
[33:18] come up with but it has come right from
[33:21] that place that Isaiah looked at this
[33:23] role of God has come right down from the
[33:25] cherubims and the seraphim's past the
[33:27] angels down into the lips of a little
[33:29] prophet their priests preach the word
[33:31] and you're sitting at home listening in
[33:34] to a tape or whatever and you're saying
[33:35] lord I believe and are you catching that
[33:37] same vision that Isaiah saw the Gospel
[33:41] message is the influence the gospel is
[33:44] the greatest influence on your life
[33:45] because it is the spoken word the Word
[33:49] of God come into the heart of the
[33:50] believer to influence you to transform
[33:53] your mind to change the heart of the
[33:55] believer
[33:56] that's why brother Branham could say in
[33:58] the handwriting on the wall we said as I
[34:01] look down here and see
[34:03] and women bow at the altar under the
[34:05] influence of the gospel oh so happy Lord
[34:09] that we have something that puts us
[34:10] under an influence it isn't a strong
[34:13] drink it's a wine of pinnacles it
[34:16] influences us to do right it takes all
[34:19] the wrong the way and makes it right
[34:21] we're so happy for this Lord
[34:23] these men have tasted of God these women
[34:27] have tasted of God tonight maybe for the
[34:30] first time in their life something has
[34:32] spoke of their hearts and said child of
[34:35] mine now listen listen to the way he
[34:37] puts this he said I was the one who kept
[34:41] you from having that accident he's
[34:43] making it personal he's saying I was the
[34:45] one that kept you from having that car
[34:47] accident or whatever
[34:48] I'm the one that preserved your life I'm
[34:51] the one that kept you for this special
[34:53] moment that I could come down and
[34:55] influence you and speak directly to your
[34:57] heart and come and show you something
[34:59] from behind the veil something that
[35:02] naturalised can I see I was the one who
[35:07] spared you when you would die now won't
[35:10] you come and return and give your life
[35:12] to me and let me guide you and take you
[35:15] home and I love you and I want to be
[35:18] good to you listen that's the kind of
[35:21] influence that I've that's the kind of
[35:22] influence in the gospel brings where it
[35:25] opens up your eyes to the presence of a
[35:27] living God that God is there and he's
[35:30] dealing with you he's he's wooing off
[35:33] your spirit he's speaking to you so
[35:35] there's a deep that's calling to the
[35:37] deep and there's got to be emptied to
[35:40] respond listen there is there is more
[35:48] than an earthly influence if you can
[35:51] just let your soul will look beyond the
[35:53] things of this natural world and peer
[35:55] into that hidden realm there is an
[35:58] influence of a heavenly keyless John you
[36:01] deny so tonight I want to look I want to
[36:07] take some time to look at the influence
[36:09] of dissipation that Isaiah had now now
[36:13] remember the plan here and this message
[36:15] that we're looking at that were
[36:16] examining tonight the plan is that Isiah
[36:19] first saw a vision then the vision
[36:22] caused the reaction the next reaction
[36:25] that the vision called was it caused it
[36:28] to realize the particular but that he
[36:31] was in and he cried out Halley he began
[36:34] to look inward no longer was he looking
[36:36] at you sigh and saying well it's all his
[36:39] fault
[36:39] looking at all the people outside say
[36:41] well it's I'm in this shade because of
[36:44] those people it's it's my pastors fault
[36:46] of the Deacons father the ministers
[36:48] fault that no but he began to cry woe is
[36:50] me woe is me I'm the problem he said in
[36:59] verse 5 I said then I said I was me for
[37:02] I am undone because I am a man of
[37:06] unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of
[37:08] a people of unclean lips for mine eyes
[37:11] have seen the king the Lord of hosts
[37:15] listen listen when all through the Bible
[37:17] when these men of God caught that kind
[37:20] of a vision their reaction was always
[37:22] the same daniel said my calmness has
[37:25] turned the corruption job said I am vile
[37:29] I abhor myself
[37:31] Paul said who our Lord and what can I do
[37:33] when you catch the vision you realize
[37:36] that yeah it causes you just realize the
[37:40] sorry sting of the vilest of your
[37:43] predicament that there's none good in
[37:45] you there's none good and you know not
[37:47] one and we all have fallen short and we
[37:50] need a savior we and listen that kind of
[37:53] a vision will cause you to fall your
[37:55] knees and begin to beg God for you begin
[37:58] to confess your sins listen it drove our
[38:02] Zeya to true worship he began to have an
[38:07] understanding of what true worship was
[38:09] he'd been looking at the wrong thing he
[38:12] thought he could see but all this time
[38:13] his lips were unclean and he didn't
[38:16] realize it he had been miss placing his
[38:21] reverence he had been giving reverence
[38:24] to man instead of the God he had been
[38:28] influenced by corruptible and changing
[38:30] flesh
[38:31] and he realized that he did not
[38:33] understand the true humility true
[38:36] humility is not you must bow to my will
[38:38] but you must bow to gods but you know
[38:41] what truth Milly is true whom Italy is
[38:44] not being a pushover true humility is
[38:47] not just it's somebody that want me it
[38:51] won't stand for the truth true humility
[38:53] is when you can look into the Word of
[38:56] God and see what God requires and say I
[38:58] believe it I believe it and I will do it
[39:01] whatever you require Lord if you require
[39:03] me to get on my knees and confess all my
[39:05] sins
[39:05] if you require me to go to my brother
[39:07] and confess all my wrongs to him if you
[39:10] require me to go to church every day for
[39:13] the rest of my life every time that the
[39:15] church doors are open I'll do it if you
[39:16] require me to pay my tithe if you
[39:18] require me to just bow myself in
[39:21] humility
[39:22] if you require me to do like these
[39:23] angels that cover their face with you
[39:25] with their wings and humility
[39:27] whatever you want me to do I will do it
[39:30] that is humility
[39:31] that is godly community community
[39:33] humility whatever your word requires I
[39:36] will do it not whatever I require but
[39:40] whatever you require it psalm chapter 32
[39:43] verse father says I acknowledge my sin
[39:46] under thee and mine iniquity have I not
[39:48] healed I said I will confess my
[39:50] transgressions under the Lord and thou
[39:52] forgave us the iniquity of my sin do you
[39:54] see do you see when when Isaiah
[39:56] confessed his sin the angel I said the
[40:01] angel flew to the altar they are angel
[40:04] did not daughter Seraphim do not doll
[40:06] around and say well let's see if it's
[40:07] really genuine when you confess your sin
[40:10] God is quick to come on the scene and
[40:13] forgive you it doesn't take you beating
[40:15] your back you you're back with some kind
[40:17] of whip or something that doesn't take
[40:19] you pushing a penny down the street with
[40:21] your nose all you have to do is confess
[40:24] your sin and say Lord I was wrong and
[40:26] that should be the same reaction when a
[40:28] brother or sister confesses their false
[40:30] to you you quickly forgive them because
[40:33] all of your sins have been forgiven by I
[40:36] just and the holy God who didn't have to
[40:39] forgive your seat
[40:40] but he wiped the slate clean the James
[40:43] 5:15 it says in the prayer of faith
[40:45] shall save the sick and the Lord shall
[40:47] raise him up and if he have committed
[40:49] sins they shall be forgiven him
[40:51] do you realize what a great promise we
[40:54] have access to
[40:55] I've known still something Zack was
[40:57] saying on the way over here see he was
[40:59] Zack was he got to testify and he said
[41:01] you know the whole Bible is a promise of
[41:04] God and all I have to do is believe it
[41:07] do you know do you know that's when you
[41:11] can look into the Word of God and see
[41:13] eyes yes all it is is God's love led to
[41:17] me and part of his love letter is that
[41:19] he's promised to forgive you of your
[41:21] sins he's promised it and all you have
[41:24] to do is believe it confess your sins
[41:26] and he's quick to come on the scene
[41:27] because first John chapter 1 verse 9
[41:30] says if we confess our sins he is
[41:32] faithful and just to forgive us our sins
[41:34] and to cleanse us from all
[41:36] unrighteousness now you talk about a
[41:39] privilege to be able to lay everything
[41:41] that you've done no matter what it is no
[41:44] matter what your past looks like to be
[41:46] able to lay it at the feet of the cross
[41:48] and say yeah I did it and I'm sorry God
[41:51] forgive me forgive me of all I've done
[41:53] and you're gonna look up at the cross
[41:55] and see that blood dipping down and know
[41:57] that it was for you that he died for you
[42:00] and that blood of stripe City bar was
[42:03] for your iniquities and for your healing
[42:05] and for all all the wrong that you've
[42:07] never done so that he can wipe it away
[42:12] if you'll confess it but listen I
[42:16] believe in you confess it I don't
[42:18] believe in the way that a lot of people
[42:19] do is that a they get caught up and all
[42:21] their sins and everything and they want
[42:22] to come find a minister to do the
[42:24] praying for oh well you will you pray
[42:26] will you pray for me no you did the sin
[42:28] and you do the praying you're the one
[42:30] that did the sin and you do the pray
[42:31] you're the one that needs a relationship
[42:33] with God the minister Lord willing
[42:35] already has a relationship with God
[42:36] you're the one that needs the
[42:38] relationship with God so you don't need
[42:40] to go find somebody that you can blame
[42:41] it on again you don't need to find
[42:43] somebody to do the
[42:44] the relationship part of it for you
[42:46] you're the one that needs to do the
[42:48] brain brother brain was said in the
[42:55] Church of the Living God he said now you
[42:57] might come and confess your sins to me
[42:59] and ask me to pray for you but I cannot
[43:01] forgive you if you sinned against me I
[43:03] can forgive you but if you sinned
[43:05] against God he is the only one that can
[43:08] forgive you and he has forgiven every
[43:10] person in the world that ever will will
[43:12] be in the world they're already forgiven
[43:14] but it will never help them until they
[43:16] accept it by faith and then confess it
[43:22] so first you see the vision you've got
[43:26] to catch the vision and the vision comes
[43:28] the influence of that vision comes by
[43:31] the preaching of the gospel so if you're
[43:33] not in church how are you going to catch
[43:34] the vision or if you're not listening to
[43:36] church your heart even if you're not in
[43:38] church right now your heart should be so
[43:39] burning to be on Church I'm not bragging
[43:43] on my family tonight but Luke Haley will
[43:44] Kaylie was telling us I want to get back
[43:46] to church so bad because she misses
[43:48] being with the people of God something
[43:50] within you should have a desire to be a
[43:52] church and if you have an opportunity to
[43:54] be in church and you turn it down what's
[43:56] wrong with you what do you realize what
[43:58] what kind of an opportunity you're
[44:00] turning down you know there's there's
[44:03] quotes I believe I believe I can find I
[44:05] don't know where it is right now but
[44:06] brother Aaron said that you if you have
[44:07] an opportunity and sure that you hear
[44:09] the message and you turn it down you
[44:11] turn your back somebody else will fill
[44:13] your seat you don't want somebody else
[44:15] to fill your seat and glory if you've
[44:17] got a seat and if you've got a seat in
[44:19] the church you take it while you can
[44:20] because God wants you to be forgiven he
[44:24] wants you to catch the vision and that
[44:25] is that provided way is by the gospel so
[44:30] you catch the vision then you confess
[44:33] and then he cleans you the Bible says in
[44:38] verse 6 it says then flew one of the
[44:39] seraphim's under me having a live coal
[44:41] in his hand which he had taken with the
[44:44] tongs from off the altar and he laid it
[44:46] upon my mouth and said lo this earth
[44:49] touched our lips and that iniquity is
[44:51] taken away and I sin purged
[44:54] listen brother Brahim said in the
[44:56] message testimony he said just I tell
[44:58] you this old-time religion brother it
[45:00] straightens you up see that's another
[45:03] effect of the gospel the gospel will
[45:05] bring you to conviction it will bring
[45:07] you to confession and it will clean you
[45:10] up why because it's the washing of the
[45:12] water of the word as you listen to the
[45:14] word it's cleaning you up and you're not
[45:16] and listen if you don't listen to movies
[45:18] and you go listen the worldnetdaily and
[45:20] you go listen to all this all the thing
[45:22] you go fill up your soul with all that
[45:24] kind of stuff that's not cleaning you up
[45:26] but if you fill up your soul with the
[45:28] gospel and I'll clean you up and
[45:30] transform you right up it'll make you
[45:32] into a new creation
[45:34] brother brother said it'll make a silk
[45:37] dress and a calico put their arms around
[45:39] one another and call a sister is that
[45:41] right it'll make a tuxedo suit and a
[45:43] pair of overalls call each other brother
[45:45] that's what it'll do brother it'll clean
[45:47] you up it'll make no difference in you
[45:50] listen that's why I believe that what
[45:53] will bring us into one Accord it's not
[45:55] it's just trying to fake it and just
[45:57] trying to fake a love with one another
[45:59] but the gospel will tear down the wall
[46:02] of separation between brothers if you
[46:04] one brother has a lot of money and the
[46:06] other brother doesn't or one brother
[46:07] comes from this background or that but
[46:09] whatever and the gospel is bringing us
[46:11] into one Accord the gospel is what is
[46:14] holding us down in the end time and and
[46:17] bringing us to a place where we know
[46:20] where we stand
[46:24] I'm trying to that Clark's moving on
[46:26] around I've got so many notes my
[46:28] goodness I can never get to all these in
[46:30] the time allotted but so let's just kind
[46:33] of let's kind of move through look God
[46:35] cleans you up as brother way he's been
[46:37] nailing down justification of
[46:40] sanctification the baptism oligos do you
[46:42] realize why those were important those
[46:43] are not just stages to go through I'm
[46:47] going through justification now I'm in
[46:49] sanctification God's taking you through
[46:52] a process because he's got something
[46:54] good for you and you rely we'll get a
[46:57] little bit deep here but there's there's
[46:58] three different stages of that cycle and
[47:00] and when you might be going on through
[47:02] the statute perfect man
[47:04] but God is sanctifying you and your
[47:05] spirit he's cleansing you because he's
[47:07] got something good for you
[47:09] that's what sanctification is he's
[47:11] cleaning you around because he's got
[47:12] something that he wants to put inside of
[47:14] you he's got something he wants to fill
[47:16] you up with and that's why it cleans you
[47:19] out because he wants to Commission you
[47:20] he wants to feel he was something he
[47:23] wants to give you something where you
[47:24] can be tired you can have an absolute
[47:27] that's anchored and filled with his
[47:29] goodness and knowledge of who he is and
[47:31] agreeing with the word and not shaken by
[47:33] every wind of doctrine and influenced by
[47:36] that heavenly King so in verse 8 it says
[47:39] also I heard the voice of the Lord
[47:41] saying whom shall I see and then who go
[47:43] who will go for us but then said I here
[47:46] am I send me because God the reason for
[47:49] God cleaning you up is because he wants
[47:51] to send you he wants to send you out you
[47:57] know do you know what a commission is
[47:59] and Ana military a commissioned officer
[48:02] is somebody who's been given an order
[48:05] they begin authorized to produce a
[48:07] certain effect in the military they've
[48:09] give they've given their beginning their
[48:11] papers they begin their instructions
[48:13] while you're in the military and they
[48:14] see these are the things that I want you
[48:16] to do and they they've got their order
[48:18] they've got their Commission now now God
[48:21] Commission's us by filling us with the
[48:23] Holy Ghost in with power and now in the
[48:26] Old Testament
[48:27] Isaiah could not get that new birth
[48:28] because Jesus had not died so the life
[48:31] could not come back into him but yet he
[48:33] was commissioned after he was cleansed
[48:36] to go and preach the gospel in other
[48:39] words the angel told the Seraphim told
[48:41] him I got something for you to go talk
[48:43] about and and you know a minister of the
[48:46] gospel you say well how am I called to
[48:47] preach a minister of the gospel is
[48:49] called to preach by God giving him
[48:51] something to say you know you're called
[48:54] because you've got something to say it's
[48:56] not just because you feel something or
[48:58] you want to have lordship both other
[49:00] people are you you have a strong desire
[49:02] to put people in their place and slap
[49:03] people upside the head but God calls you
[49:06] by giving you something to say and he'll
[49:08] not just ministers though but he calls
[49:10] every born-again believer by coming and
[49:12] putting
[49:13] self inside of that person and going in
[49:15] them to accomplish the work that he has
[49:18] in their life that's why if you want to
[49:20] be an influencer you've got to have an
[49:22] influencer in you to know what your
[49:25] place is in the gospel and when you find
[49:28] your place in the gospel when you find
[49:30] your place and you can stay in that
[49:32] place and stand rooted like the moon or
[49:34] the Sun and the stars then you can be
[49:37] the right kind of influence to others
[49:39] because you've got the influence you're
[49:41] living on the inside of you
[49:43] that's why in John chapter 20 verse 21
[49:46] said then said Jesus to them again peace
[49:47] be unto you as my father hath sent me
[49:49] even so send I you
[49:52] why how did he send them by going in
[49:55] them and what what have you been
[49:58] commissioned to do like an officer in
[50:00] the army you've been you've not been
[50:01] commissioned us to sit around and you
[50:03] not been commissioned to sit at home and
[50:05] there any Cheetos and and fill your
[50:08] failures your spiritual sous with all of
[50:11] this Hollywood and trash and all of this
[50:13] kind of stuff but you've been
[50:15] commissioned to cast out Devils you make
[50:19] Commission to fulfill the Lord to be the
[50:21] manifestation of the word and your day
[50:23] you've been commissioned do you know the
[50:25] church has been commissioned the
[50:26] ministry has been commissioned to build
[50:28] the church that's ephesians 4 11 and 12
[50:30] to build up the church until using the
[50:32] full the full stature of a perfect man
[50:34] and do you know you make commission to
[50:37] be the light of the world you make
[50:39] commission to you or the thing that the
[50:41] light that people at work will see when
[50:44] when they don't know anything about the
[50:45] gospel you have been commissioned to be
[50:47] a blessing to others that's why a lot of
[50:50] times we'll get prayer requests that we
[50:52] pray for here in our church for people
[50:54] who are not message believers and may
[50:56] not even be christians because you have
[50:58] been commissioned to be a blessing to
[51:00] all the world and that's why you know
[51:02] there's been this great discussion
[51:03] should i should i pray for people out
[51:06] there in the world they've got
[51:07] coronavirus and things should i pray or
[51:09] should i be like like the sons of
[51:12] zebedee and it should we love to pray
[51:14] that fire will be called down from God
[51:16] out of heaven on these people that the
[51:17] destruction of the flesh may reign on
[51:19] them listen while we're here on the
[51:21] earth we are predestinated to be a
[51:23] blessing
[51:24] you are predestinated to be a blessing
[51:26] you are a blessing to this earth and
[51:28] even you know even if the earth even if
[51:31] they're sinners on the earth you still
[51:34] the blood covering still abides on the
[51:36] earth as long as the bride is present
[51:39] when the bride leaves it leaves the
[51:41] earth then all hell will break loose
[51:44] then everything will break loose upon
[51:46] the earth but while you're here on the
[51:48] earth you are a blessing I want to be a
[51:50] blessing to pee I want to be a blessing
[51:52] to people listen I my boss says a Muslim
[51:55] man but we get along fine he is he's
[51:57] testified on my behalf he's done great
[51:59] things for me we have a wonderful a
[52:01] working relationship because I want to
[52:04] be a blessing to other people I don't
[52:07] want to be a curse you say well this
[52:09] person I remember growing up you'd hear
[52:11] about people in the message to be like
[52:12] well I don't even want to talk to that
[52:13] person on the other side of the road
[52:15] because they don't believe the way as I
[52:16] do can you imagine that kind of an
[52:18] attitude you're looking at other people
[52:20] and say well they don't believe like me
[52:21] I don't want to fellowship with them
[52:23] listen we're not we're not here to be a
[52:25] curse we're here to be a blessing to be
[52:27] a light to the world and how can you be
[52:31] a light to the world except that light
[52:33] being you that influence not an earthly
[52:36] influence but a heavenly influence the
[52:39] influence of a heavenly King look at
[52:42] this picture of influence times running
[52:46] away and I was I guess after six persons
[52:51] verse two was said above it stood this
[52:52] era from this vision that Isaiah saw
[52:54] above it stood the Seraphim each one has
[52:57] six wings with Twain and covered his
[52:59] face and with twain he covered his feet
[53:01] and with twain he fly he didn't fly and
[53:04] you see this picture of influence that
[53:07] Isaiah was looking at as a striking
[53:09] opposition to the influence that Uzziah
[53:12] demonstrated because these these six
[53:15] wings over their face over their feet
[53:17] and flying with were the exact opposite
[53:20] of what used I had demonstrated Uzziah
[53:23] did not have humility and the time when
[53:25] he needed humility he did not have a
[53:27] reverence in the time that he needed
[53:28] reverence and he did not put his faith
[53:31] in the action which is what these six
[53:33] wings represent do you know what what
[53:36] real rare let's start with the
[53:37] over the face reverence the wings over
[53:40] that real reverence comes by recognizing
[53:45] the presence of God and I'm talking
[53:51] about the presence of God in this
[53:53] building tonight the presence of God in
[53:55] your homes tonight as you listen in
[53:57] listen you don't have to be in this
[53:59] church building tonight but God is
[54:02] present right where you are tonight
[54:04] whatever you have need of he's there
[54:06] ready to meet your need and he's present
[54:11] in your pastor he's present and by the
[54:14] way if you can recognize the presence of
[54:18] God and the people that you're dealing
[54:19] with and the church that you're a symbol
[54:22] in in your home tonight then it will
[54:25] bring reverence yeah I remember people
[54:28] hearing people talking about how when
[54:30] they would come into brother Brandon's
[54:31] meetings and it would look all smoky and
[54:33] everything and that everybody would be
[54:35] quiet because even before the search had
[54:37] the church service had started people
[54:40] knew that there was a that like I heard
[54:43] he described that they knew that there
[54:45] were angels lining the building and so
[54:48] it caused a condition of reverence and
[54:50] the people because they recognized the
[54:53] presence of God they knew that God was
[54:56] there and something was happening when
[54:58] that little man stepped out from behind
[54:59] the pulpit and he began to speak to them
[55:01] they knew that that was not just a
[55:03] little man speaking but that was God
[55:05] speaking to them do you know when you
[55:07] come in the church as somebody was
[55:09] telling me that in Africa they pull so
[55:12] hard because they believe that that man
[55:15] behind the pulpit that is God speaking
[55:17] to them and they have a reverence for
[55:20] that man up there that he's delivering
[55:22] the Word of God to them because they
[55:24] have such confidence that that is God
[55:26] speaking of it if you come into the
[55:28] house of God with a reverence like that
[55:30] God can begin to deal with you the kind
[55:36] of reverence that calls Moses to take
[55:38] his shoes off because he knew that God
[55:41] was there the kind of reverence that
[55:43] caused Paul to drop to the ground
[55:45] because he knew that that was
[55:48] God reverence comes by recognizing the
[55:53] present so they almighty live in God but
[55:57] him said in the message influenced one
[55:59] of the messages that he preached in 90s
[56:02] this was in 1963 he said no reverence
[56:04] the people tried to do write me and take
[56:07] a stand for the Word of God and say I'm
[56:09] gonna have my congregation cleaned up
[56:11] the first thing you know what complaint
[56:13] comes in from somebody else and they
[56:14] asked him he has to get out on the
[56:16] street why they're not convinced of his
[56:20] presence in other words they're not
[56:22] convinced that that is God moving on the
[56:25] scene they're not convinced that that's
[56:27] God and that man you ought to do like
[56:31] David said put the Lord always before my
[56:33] face I shall not be moved let the Lord
[56:36] be before me I'll have him on my right
[56:38] hand now he'll be before my face
[56:39] wherever I see I want to see Jesus in it
[56:42] I'll go to a place I'll do nothing my
[56:44] influence just to let it be for him
[56:48] recognizing his presence brings
[56:51] reverence another story maybe we could
[56:54] relate his blind bartimaeus
[56:56] sitting on the side of the road blind
[56:59] his eyes were covered over he couldn't
[57:01] see but then when they identified Christ
[57:04] of all ages came walking down the street
[57:06] and they said he began to call out he
[57:08] said the Bible says when he heard that
[57:10] it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry
[57:13] out and say Jesus thou son of David have
[57:15] mercy on him mercy on me why because he
[57:19] recognized that Jesus was there in front
[57:22] of him he recognized his presence and
[57:27] the Bible says above it's to the
[57:28] seraphim's each one verse two each one
[57:31] has six wings with twain he covered his
[57:34] face and with twain he covered his feet
[57:36] and with twain he did fly humility who
[57:40] middlee over the feet humility their
[57:42] obedience to god's word consciousness to
[57:45] your littleness do you realize you can't
[57:47] obey God's Word in the proper way until
[57:50] you are conscious of your littleness
[57:51] that there's no good in you because
[57:54] otherwise you'll come of your approach
[57:55] God's words like kaindi it all puffed up
[57:58] within yourself and say and my way or
[58:00] the highway and all this
[58:01] kind of things but I'm sending that in
[58:05] the message of influence preached in
[58:06] 1964 he said here is a good example
[58:08] always be conscious of your littleness
[58:10] not your bigness brother branham said he
[58:14] began to talk about the woman at the
[58:16] wheel on the message influence in 1963
[58:18] he said he was talking about how she
[58:20] became conscious of her littleness and
[58:22] she approached Jesus with humility and
[58:24] reverence and then she went into action
[58:28] he said but he had truth vindicated
[58:30] god-given truth what happened her wings
[58:33] quickly went over her face the wings
[58:35] went over her feet she said sir not
[58:39] Beelzebub sir the best I know you must
[58:43] be a prophet now I know we haven't had a
[58:45] prophet for hundreds of years but the
[58:47] scripture says that when the Messiah
[58:48] comes and and she began to relate to him
[58:50] all that she knew about what the Messiah
[58:53] would be and then he began to open up
[58:55] her eyes and she said then she went into
[58:58] action come see a man you see putting
[59:01] things into action is where a lot of
[59:04] times we fall short but bramma
[59:07] a lot of times he would he would
[59:08] describe putting your faith into action
[59:10] as like shifting into gear shifted into
[59:14] gear and you can be sitting in the
[59:15] church tonight or at home wherever you
[59:17] are and and hearing the words that I
[59:19] speak in and it's not in gear but
[59:22] brother I'm said to put it in gear all
[59:23] you have to do is say I believe that you
[59:27] know that is nothing but the truth I
[59:29] believe that and what that does is it
[59:33] it's just putting all of your faith just
[59:36] just taking God at His Word and putting
[59:40] it all back in God's lap to fulfill I'm
[59:46] jumping ahead of myself I've got some
[59:48] quotes about that listen you think about
[59:53] all these people in the Bible that we
[59:54] look to as examples that that put their
[59:57] faith in gear like the woman at the
[59:59] whale or Peter when Jesus told him that
[1:00:02] Peter said I had I've been fishing all
[1:00:03] day and I hadn't called anything and
[1:00:05] Jesus said we're just just cast your net
[1:00:07] over on the other side it's such a
[1:00:08] simple little thing such a simple little
[1:00:10] thing that almost compares with a lot of
[1:00:12] times what a minister will be preaching
[1:00:13] on the pulpit
[1:00:14] and we might do like Peter thought maybe
[1:00:17] in his mind well why would I do that why
[1:00:20] would I cast my head over on that other
[1:00:23] side it doesn't make sense it doesn't
[1:00:25] compare with all of my schooling it
[1:00:28] doesn't compare I went to college and it
[1:00:31] doesn't compare
[1:00:32] but Peter just put he just shifted into
[1:00:35] that gear and cast over on the other
[1:00:37] side and just obeyed the word of the
[1:00:39] Lord what about this interior and they
[1:00:42] said I'm not worthy I'm not worthy for
[1:00:45] you to come in my house he said listen
[1:00:46] I've got people over me and I've got
[1:00:48] people under me so I know what it is to
[1:00:50] be a into a Thor to have to be an
[1:00:53] authority or or even to be under
[1:00:54] Authority when my boss tells me
[1:00:57] something to do I go do it
[1:00:58] and when I tell an underling under me to
[1:01:00] go do what I do it so I know that you
[1:01:01] are in authority and if you tell that
[1:01:03] devil to get out you don't have to be in
[1:01:05] my house you can sit right here where
[1:01:07] you are and what he wasn't what was he
[1:01:10] doing he was shifting his faith into
[1:01:11] gear now stay with me now don't don't
[1:01:14] fall asleep and you at home - we're in
[1:01:18] church we're or whether you wear whether
[1:01:20] you're at home or whether you're whether
[1:01:21] you're here don't leave back in your
[1:01:23] recliner don't flip that thing up and
[1:01:25] get too comfortable we're in a church
[1:01:27] listen Moses flipped his faith in the
[1:01:30] gear when he God told him something that
[1:01:32] seemed impossible and he went down into
[1:01:34] Egypt and you know what flipping it
[1:01:36] flipping it into gear looks like a lot
[1:01:39] of times we'll think that we've got
[1:01:41] something to prove but we don't have
[1:01:43] anything to prove it's not the bride
[1:01:46] that does the proving it's the
[1:01:47] bridegroom listen when some if some man
[1:01:50] were to come on the scene and start
[1:01:52] picking at my wife or something it would
[1:01:54] be me to step up my wife is not gonna
[1:01:56] defend herself I'll step out and say get
[1:01:58] a get away from here with her I'm the
[1:02:00] one that has to defend my home I'm the
[1:02:02] one that has a gun that if somebody were
[1:02:04] to come into my house I would defend my
[1:02:05] home because I'm the man and God is the
[1:02:08] one that will defend his word listen all
[1:02:10] the times we think we've got something
[1:02:12] to prove whether or not to put on the
[1:02:13] mask when we go to shopping her to take
[1:02:15] a mask oh I don't want to wear a mask
[1:02:17] come on prove what kind of or i'ma put
[1:02:19] on a mask because I prove something we
[1:02:21] like to prove anything
[1:02:22] Oh
[1:02:23] have to do is all you have to do is take
[1:02:25] God at His Word and he'll come on the
[1:02:27] seat and prove it
[1:02:31] listen spiritually speaking now the
[1:02:34] bride the woman does not have to provide
[1:02:37] she does not have to preach this one
[1:02:40] time and a lot of the sisters got upset
[1:02:41] with me for preaching this I no joke
[1:02:44] that were telling my wife that I did not
[1:02:45] value her and things like they haven't
[1:02:47] let you do you miss my point my point is
[1:02:49] now that I'm trying to devalue sisters
[1:02:51] my point is to show your place in the
[1:02:53] gospel that you you don't have to
[1:02:56] provide you don't have to fulfill the
[1:02:58] word it's God doing it in you God is the
[1:03:01] one that will bring his word to pass all
[1:03:03] you have to do that is the only
[1:03:05] obligation that you have is to believe
[1:03:07] his word and he will come on the scene
[1:03:10] and prove it listen there were
[1:03:12] situations where the word would got
[1:03:14] challenged where that uh the the brother
[1:03:17] branham's pastor you know when he was in
[1:03:18] the Baptist Church he he went up and
[1:03:20] they challenged who will come up and
[1:03:22] drink this this poison whatever it was
[1:03:24] strychnine or or whatever they had on
[1:03:26] the up there on the pulpit he said they
[1:03:29] got that challenge is there anybody that
[1:03:31] will take God at His Word and he said
[1:03:33] I'll accept the challenge he went up and
[1:03:35] drank it straight poison and God come on
[1:03:38] the scene and backed him up listen but
[1:03:40] we don't go around taking up snakes and
[1:03:42] drinking poison on a daily basis just to
[1:03:44] prove something we don't have anything
[1:03:46] to prove I have nothing to prove you
[1:03:49] know it was it was the devil that would
[1:03:51] go do what challenge that challenge
[1:03:53] Jesus he said prove prove who you are
[1:03:56] once you cast yourself down off of this
[1:03:58] step once you turn this bread into these
[1:04:00] stones into bread prove it prove it they
[1:04:03] told brother branham won't you cut this
[1:04:04] girl's arm and prove oh you are by by
[1:04:07] healing her proven that is the devil
[1:04:10] talking we don't have anything to prove
[1:04:12] I don't have anything to prove listen
[1:04:14] wait if we're sick if you if you get
[1:04:17] well that's God coming on the scene but
[1:04:20] if God allows things to take a little
[1:04:22] bit longer that doesn't mean that God
[1:04:24] has left you he might just be proving
[1:04:26] you
[1:04:27] listen if you're sick deny that doesn't
[1:04:30] mean that doesn't mean that God's not
[1:04:32] with you anymore that doesn't mean that
[1:04:33] you don't have the Holy Ghost that's
[1:04:36] just a bunch of nonsense could you
[1:04:38] imagine if you've got a cold too my same
[1:04:40] one I don't know if this person has the
[1:04:41] Holy Ghost listen if you got the
[1:04:43] coronavirus tonight that doesn't mean
[1:04:45] you got don't have the Holy Ghost but I
[1:04:46] believe if you've got the coronavirus
[1:04:48] we've got a healer we got a healer that
[1:04:49] can come on the scene and heal it he'll
[1:04:52] come on the scene and prove his word
[1:04:53] I believe it we don't have nothing to
[1:04:56] prove but he will prove his word us
[1:04:58] that's what I told Zack when he was
[1:04:59] seeking the Holy Ghost I said he is
[1:05:01] obligated to prove his word he is
[1:05:04] obligated to bring his word to pass all
[1:05:06] you have to do is believe it could you
[1:05:10] imagine somebody saying well well you've
[1:05:12] got to give yourself the Holy Ghost you
[1:05:13] can't give yourself the Holy Ghost that
[1:05:15] would how could you give yourself the
[1:05:17] Holy Ghost how could you heal yourself
[1:05:18] you can't do those things it's God that
[1:05:22] proves that I I don't know why I cut all
[1:05:24] into that but anyway I hope I laid that
[1:05:26] down I hope I nail that so far in the
[1:05:28] ground that it'll never come up again
[1:05:30] let's burn that down in the ground but
[1:05:43] mom said stay an abstraction in the
[1:05:45] message the influence of another he said
[1:05:47] if you believe God heals stay in action
[1:05:49] and he said if you believe he's going to
[1:05:52] call you out now and you're holding on
[1:05:53] to him stay in action stay in action you
[1:05:56] got two wings so using stay in action
[1:05:59] wave them back and forth Lord I believe
[1:06:01] Lord I believe you can't just holler
[1:06:04] holy holy holy you have to say Lord I
[1:06:07] believe stay in action now how do you
[1:06:10] stay in action you ain't staying in
[1:06:12] action if you're just gobbling up all
[1:06:14] this Hollywood tommyrot or all of this
[1:06:17] all this filth of the world that they
[1:06:19] put it listen everybody's so scared
[1:06:21] every which way they turn now that
[1:06:22] nobody knows what to believe because
[1:06:24] these people over here say one thing
[1:06:27] about this situation and I'm talking
[1:06:29] about the coronavirus and there who's
[1:06:31] going to be president and all this kind
[1:06:32] of stuff listen stay in action by
[1:06:36] filling yourself up with the world
[1:06:39] [Laughter]
[1:06:42] listen brother I'm said faith ignores
[1:06:45] circumstances it don't look at the
[1:06:48] symptoms that don't look at the things
[1:06:49] of this world it knows what people say I
[1:06:52] could care less what the news says I
[1:06:55] want to see what the news of God says I
[1:06:57] want to see what his Bible says about
[1:06:58] the day in the hour that we're living in
[1:06:59] if you look into the Bible and open and
[1:07:02] you begin to get understanding of what
[1:07:03] the seven trumpets open up and how
[1:07:05] things were gonna get worse and worse
[1:07:06] and there would be plagues fall on the
[1:07:08] earth then you reading the right kind of
[1:07:10] newspaper now then you're in there you
[1:07:12] got the right kind of influence but when
[1:07:15] you're gobbling up all this time around
[1:07:16] that you don't even know whether it's
[1:07:17] true or not what kind of influence is
[1:07:19] that the real faith ignores what people
[1:07:24] say cause it's in action it's not a
[1:07:26] shame that doesn't have a hindrance it
[1:07:28] knows where it's sick stands it's burly
[1:07:32] and Brawley and it sees only victory
[1:07:34] what why can it only see victory because
[1:07:38] it's tied to the victorious one that
[1:07:40] already paid the price for you at
[1:07:42] Calvary he's already made you victorious
[1:07:44] and you don't have to prove it he's
[1:07:47] already proven it you're trying to skip
[1:07:54] through IIIi didn't mean to keep you
[1:07:56] long tonight I'm but I do have some
[1:08:00] things to say listen tonight brother
[1:08:06] branham said in the hour has come he
[1:08:07] said when you accept him as your healer
[1:08:09] don't never act like you're sick or
[1:08:11] crippled anymore I believe that you're
[1:08:13] healed take him at his word there now
[1:08:16] here's here's the quote that I read this
[1:08:18] in their Sunday School class then it's
[1:08:20] all over own garden and not on you see
[1:08:25] as long as you take God at His Word then
[1:08:27] the word will produce what it promised
[1:08:29] to do is that right now have faith
[1:08:31] believe him with all your heart in other
[1:08:33] words you don't have to produce
[1:08:34] predation from disease he's the one that
[1:08:36] does it you don't have to produce
[1:08:38] healing for your body he's the one that
[1:08:40] it's all on God
[1:08:42] and faith puts it all on God do you know
[1:08:44] he wants you to do that well we were on
[1:08:49] tell you what Zacks but it started being
[1:08:51] a I'm not preaching on how good my
[1:08:53] family is and I don't get that but he's
[1:08:55] he's when somebody gets influenced by
[1:08:57] their Heavenly King
[1:08:58] then you want to be around him because
[1:09:00] they start influencing you and he'd been
[1:09:02] testifying lately about how that uh all
[1:09:08] these things that are happening to him
[1:09:09] well now I lost my train of thought I
[1:09:11] forgot what I was gonna say anyway let's
[1:09:13] keep going on you know you don't have to
[1:09:17] produce the new birth yeah I know I'm
[1:09:23] getting older whatever you know I have
[1:09:29] to produce salvation for your children
[1:09:31] he's the one that produces that if you
[1:09:33] just if you just laid claim to that and
[1:09:35] that's what I was going to talk about
[1:09:37] probably brought up a through my memory
[1:09:39] he was talking about how if you look
[1:09:41] into the promises of God's Word and just
[1:09:43] lay it in front of it then it puts it
[1:09:46] back on him it puts it back on him
[1:09:48] aren't you that's what what kind of
[1:09:50] goodies your plan is there I mean any
[1:09:54] kind of porous car salesman in the world
[1:09:56] the poorest salesman should be able to
[1:09:57] sell the gospel because you hardly have
[1:09:59] to do any work it sells itself
[1:10:04] you don't have to produce a duration in
[1:10:07] your life a job you don't have to
[1:10:09] produce a guide us and guide us on what
[1:10:11] you should do all you have to do is grab
[1:10:15] a hold to the Word of God and just just
[1:10:17] receive that and let it begin to produce
[1:10:20] brother Anna said in Mary's belief he
[1:10:22] said it's not me to try to figure it out
[1:10:24] let's take the word of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:27] he's the one who made the promise he's
[1:10:30] the one who confirms that promise he's
[1:10:32] obligated to keep that promise these are
[1:10:35] all good quotes to hang on to you know
[1:10:38] when you when you get in a down spot or
[1:10:39] you get into some troubles times or
[1:10:41] whatever I've been in some troubles
[1:10:43] times myself you know what sickness
[1:10:45] heartache lose your job all these things
[1:10:48] that's when you take these scriptures
[1:10:50] and you lay them before God and say Lord
[1:10:52] I need you to come on the scene now put
[1:10:55] your faith in gear and accept him at his
[1:10:57] word put your faith in gear and say I
[1:10:59] know you are the one that made the
[1:11:02] promise now come on the scene and that's
[1:11:04] why listen to get that right kind of
[1:11:06] influence what I've been getting at all
[1:11:08] night is you got a feed that so you got
[1:11:13] a nurture that soul nurture that thing
[1:11:15] that will influence you in the right
[1:11:17] direction get your influence from the
[1:11:20] heavenly king now Isaiah had his eyes on
[1:11:22] your Ziya but when he caught the vision
[1:11:24] that regard or really wanted to see that
[1:11:27] it changed everything he saw he caught
[1:11:29] the vision and it caused it brought into
[1:11:31] a state of confession then God cleaned
[1:11:34] him up and he commissioned him and the
[1:11:37] Holy Ghost is putting the church into
[1:11:39] action now the musicians can go ahead
[1:11:41] and come home cuz I'm gonna I'm on close
[1:11:43] on this The effect of the brother I'm
[1:11:45] closed that that message influenced by
[1:11:47] talking about the effect that that that
[1:11:49] vision had on his eye he said look at
[1:11:51] that what that effect was and he closed
[1:11:53] my you talk about an amazing amazing end
[1:11:56] of that service if you go listen to that
[1:11:58] tape I had a prayer line people coming
[1:12:01] up for prayer and all kinds they did
[1:12:03] when I was listening to I think it was
[1:12:04] 1964 but calls there were people in that
[1:12:08] congregation catching the vision they
[1:12:10] were catching God wanted to do something
[1:12:12] in their life they didn't he doesn't
[1:12:15] want you to just be have you go through
[1:12:16] life with your high on on earthly things
[1:12:19] and you know in this story use I kind of
[1:12:22] types earthly things but he wants you to
[1:12:25] have your vision your eyes on him
[1:12:29] because he's got something for you to do
[1:12:31] and what is that what is that purpose
[1:12:34] for you to do is to be a light to the

[1:21:12] that we have nothing to fear Lord God
[1:21:14] because you're on the scene you're with
[1:21:16] us Granite Lord God that you'll go with
[1:21:18] your Saints and I'd go with your people
[1:21:20] Lord Jesus and ever home and ever dwell
[1:21:22] in Lord God that you'll come and be on
[1:21:24] the scene we pray in the name of the
[1:21:26] Lord Jesus Christ amen
