and our valentine's day banquet so most of you have been there and that's where we're going to have the service so if you have that in your hand let's briefly go over real quick i i always believe never keep secrets the more informed people are the more you can get done and the more you don't have surprises all right so july the 3rd look we're have we have the building from 2 o'clock to 10 o'clock service will start at 6 okay uh musicians in the sound system set up we're gonna get all that done but my whole point is if somebody taps you on the shoulder we couldn't get everybody in the sunday school class downstairs i'm not discluding anyone in this church we just need a certain group that we want to deal with and then let them deal with you guys if somebody taps you on the shoulder and says hey i need you to do this then i'd like for you to do that and i i'm i'm truly thankful that that brother dale's give us this chance to do this and uh and we should have a good time and it's your church and it's your 50th anniversary and then whenever you most of us won't ever see another 51 even if we keep going on okay some of you younger ones may but some of us old ones won't see another one so let's enjoy this one and let's uh um pitch in and help because what we're going to do is is we're going to have food and drinks after service saturday night so we'll need some of your sisters to help set up some of your brothers to help take trash out some of your brothers and sisters both to get the drinks and food it's going to be finger food it's not going to be anything hot just going to be finger food and also donuts um fruit salad fruit stuff stuff cold nothing hot okay just for them to have after the service and then after the service please do not leave stay and help clean up because the more we have to stay and help clean up the faster we can get out because the next morning we're coming right back on july the 4th service starts at 10 o'clock so we need to get there about nine o'clock set up for the food anna roberts is the one coordinating that she's getting the caterer so if you have anything to do if you want to help with the food you need to speak to her all right and then the guys are going to check sound system and then afterwards there'll be an anniversary ceremony after the service is over all right we will be honoring the two pastors that we have we'll be honoring the deacons we can remember and preachers and all that from the 50 years that we uh that we've been here so and then also the food will be set up at that time so someone will have to start do that and help serve if you have children please let them be involved if they're old enough to not stick their hands in the food and not start eating before people get there let them serve but the food setup and then the serving and then after service we'll clean up we have the building from nine to five so we'll be able to fellowship some until five o'clock that day we're only going to have one service brother mike ulti will be doing sunday at sunday service but joel forney will be doing saturday evening service mom yes the sisters of the church bring a ring finger food what we were talking about was trays of fruit trays of carrots and stuff like that anything cold nothing hot nothing we got to plug up we're keeping a warmer everything that's cold cold cuts little sandwiches roll up whatever that stuff is and slice it up um but cold stuff okay then the church will bring most of the sweet stuff though so um just get with anna get with lisa june some of those and ask them suggestions of what to do also this is what i need before we get started i need coolers we need coolers if anyone has coolers they're not using we need the coolers because there is no coolers yeah we need big cooler listen don't bring me a six can thank you josh i like that boy okay don't don't really no we don't need we don't need an individual cooler we need one with some volume to it okay if you have them we need them because there's no way to keep the ice there it has a real small refrigerator and freezer so we need a place to keep ice for two days july third and the fourth okay if you have any questions now's not the time to ask them you can ask them as we keep and continue on through we've got one month to do that so what now all right everybody mark out highway and right road because it's not old oh guilty road i'm sorry oh guildford road okay oak gills will road but you still got to put the old in okay 64-67 old gills were road and they they do have now they have a

there sometime today so anyway that's the meeting for july 3rd and 4th and thank you for all participating and for all of you coming um it's like christine yorego says she said if you don't show up for this then this is not your church i didn't say that christine said that because this is one time this is we're asking you for one weekend one weekend okay to help and to do and to serve that we've had 50 years of this building starting as a little bitty place and then grown into into all this and and i want to thank god for for for two things we've never had a split in this church we have actually grown so a large we have grown so large so we have spawned churches off of this church dad's told him that hey you need to quit driving four hours you need to go start you know start your church up there somewhere so and then that the words being preached pure and unadulterated that will keep a church from splitting when you preach the word and you let people know what's going on you preach the depth of the message you preach where nobody can have a question sure we all have questions but not doctrinal issues if you've got doctrinal questions you just haven't been around here long enough you'll learn amen that um as i said before and it's really not we give all the honor to jesus christ but it has to be preached through somebody so you give the honor to brother dale brother moat brother moat started the seeds of all this came from him and then it come to brother dale and then i believe the other four of us in the church are supporting what brother dale's been preaching for 50 years so if you do that i think that everything is is it runs good sure we're like family we have our issues and our problems but we don't have major issues because satan can do anything in the world except preach the word word by word he can't do that he can give out spiritual gifts he can make you shout he'll make you speak in tongues he'll make you do all kind of things but he cannot preach the word word by word and keep it in line so if you do that then i told him at brother pageants you can stand to your feet now brother pageants i told him i said listen i want the devil to be uncomfortable in this building i do not want the devil to be comfortable in this building if he's comfortable in this building we have a problem we want to be we know he's here we want him to be the most uncomfortable person in this building right and if he does he'll keep his mouth shut maybe he'll leave one of these days but that's the outline of what we're going to do if you have any questions anna june lisa dale and any of the deacons and any of the support people musicians just ask say hey what can i do and then everybody will have a part to play we've always had a part to play here in this church not excluding anyone also next sunday the women need to meet again so they'll meet after second service and the men we're going to go ahead and meet next week for our first time ever since last week last year for our father's day fishing trip it'll be the one and only time we need to meet so as the lady says at our uh post office just saying just saying but we're going to get together next sunday and talk about the father's day fishing trip i want to make sure that also that june the 15th you remember we're having church on tuesday night a brother from south america from nicaragua will be speaking for us he's a friend of louise's he has attended this church before but he never preached he just went come through and was in the service he's preaching that tuesday night before we leave to go to our father's day trip and luke advised me it's not a camping trip anymore you just wait you get older you won't be sleeping in the floor like we used to sleep in the floor you won't be able to get out of the floor but he said i'm not going he said it's not a fish he's not not a camping drip no more i enjoy that lodge up there i don't know about y'all but i we've been up in the mountains for years and years and years sleeping on the floor so thank goodness that we can find this place so but just keep that stuff in your in your mind i know there's a lot going on but you know i like a good active church i like something people doing things and and going forward and uh keeps everybody young and happy if so if you got your bibles turn to the book of hebrews nine and we'll continue on we're going to have communion this afternoon after the service we will not have foot washing maybe we'll start that later on um a couple of months from now or maybe next month we won't have it next month on the first because the first will be on july the 4th so um we covered your prayers all of us we need to pray for this meeting like i said before your prayers is what's going to change things the devil's going to try to slip it up but you pray and god will do just what you pray god will do that he will give us a successful meeting amen and we'll have a good time with the people brother forney's already called me twice i'm ready to come i'm ready to come so so we're looking forward to brother brother joel being there and also brother mike that sunday morning so hebrews 9 verse 11 with spy our heads daily father thank you for giving us a time on this earth that number one we can have life but we can have eternal life lord not just regular life to go out and live but we know that we're connected to that lord wherever we go we need to be a shining light for you lord we need to be able to present this gospel to a dying world and lord i pray that we'll do that and not just be lord that is just this and no more but there's more people out there to be saved people are searching for you lord and i pray that they'll find you wherever they find you lord may they become settled and know that you're the only one true and living god and jesus christ is your name father we ask you to be in the furthem of this service be with our july the third and fourth meeting be with the june time together where the sisters go off and we go off there'll be no wrecks or accidents that everything will be done wonderful and decently and in order father forgive us lord of the things that we do in our daily life lord is contrary to you lord as we look to you the author and finisher of our faith in jesus name we pray amen but christ become a high priest of good things to come by a greater more perfect tabernacle not made by hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and cows but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place and here's the the scripture that we've read for 21 times now having obtained eternal redemption for us so he obtained something and it was not for him he obtained it for me and you what a gracious god let's read romans 11 verse 25 and be seated for i would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part has happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles become you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word now let's go to ephesians 1 his brother dale had been talking about the the great ephesians church paul could not preach this to the corinthians he could only preach this to the ephesians because they were a mature church and they knew what paul was talking about well you and i should be mature christians at this point in time in our life that we can understand this and not choke on it amen as i tell you before let's just lay this thing on the line if you can't understand the message of the hour if you can't understand the bible you're not born again just admit it why in the world would god give us something and give us the new birth and they don't connect right right how can that happen it can't happen it's just your mouth so malnourished that you don't have the new birth that maybe you had an experience but you had just a maybe a um an egg under a a dog experience you understand what i mean you know you might have had a birth but you didn't get all the way you didn't go all the way and let the message of the hour see to me look the messenger hour doesn't save us right it keeps us clean makes us go up that statue of perfect man and changes this guy it changes us into the image of god there's a little thought i want to give maybe next sunday but not this sunday let's go through this and i'm having the background because we've got some new ones here and that's okay according as he has chosen us where in him listen as brother dale was saying this morning judas was chosen of god adolph hitler was chosen of god the foolish virgin everybody was chosen of god except the bride of jesus christ the bride of jesus christ was chosen in him amen before the foundation of the world so that's me and you he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be what holy and without blame before him in love he said i can't do that get born again quit making excuses that's what the world makes we were talking about last night in the sunday school class anybody you talk to you start talking to them about holiness and about hair and about dress and about uh we don't smoke and we don't drink and we don't curse and we don't do these things and they're like well i'm not perfect you're not perfect you know they'll tell you that i think i said well you're not serving the same god i'm serving right there's not listen there's not two gods that give you the same thing one's holy one's unholy there ain't no in-between you either got this one or you got this one there is no second or third or fourth god we got to deal with there's the almighty god and the one that wants to be god right and the one that wants to be god is sitting here today showing himself to be as god right you got to discern or determine or judge what you're hearing today look having predestinated us as brother dale was talking about predestinated us what unto adoption there's no other age and we'll talk about the ages in a minute because there's a seven church ages that had to come because it was already determined in the bible that we needed seven messengers we needed seven ages we needed seven stars okay because it said in the bible that's what we needed to get us to revelations five which is coming to redemption is everybody okay with that amen but we had to remember jesus didn't come to save the gentiles at first he came to his own and his own received him not he had to put her away because of her whoredom and we'll read that in just a minute having predestinated us unto adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace when he hath made us accepted in the beloved you're already accepted right exactly there's no i'm not if you got the new birth you've already been accepted amen amen stop worrying about the past if if truly you're born again god don't know what you did in your past he can't even bring it up himself you say my god can do anything no he cannot remember my sin if i ask him to forgive me and he said that i didn't that's right to the praise of the glory of his grace when hath made us accepted in the beloved look in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward us that word abounded mean heaps on top of us in all wisdom and prudence look having made known unto us the mystery of his wealth so if you've got the new birth you will know the mystery of his will but if you don't have the new birth he's not obligated to give you this mystery right he's not obligated to give you any i like what brother dale said years ago when he was preaching on adoption he said god does not adopt the devil's kids he don't have to they chose to be the devils so he can't adopt them and he's not going to adopt them he's going to adopt his own children having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure with he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times now today we're going to talk about dispensations because there was a dispensation for israel there's a dispensation for the gentiles and then god goes right back to the jews again for a dispensation of 144 thousands everybody got that if i get too fast you just go out to look what listen to the tape again then in dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together what in one not at 900 different denominations and i'm talking about the message right right folks god is not confused right there's a truth to the message and not another that's right one faith one lord one baptism one message of the hour not a hundred different messages of the hour that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance remember i read you the quote last week a week before last where brother brown said jesus didn't come to bring you your inheritance right jesus didn't come down here to develop a plan he didn't come down here just to make people feel sorry for him and they might get saved no he came down here for a purpose now you wouldn't it'd all be saved but he came down here to get me in you in whom also we have obtained an inheritance jesus didn't come to bring us inheritance he came to what pay for our inheritance to get us back to our inheritance because our inheritance was what brother dale talked about this morning that lamb's book of life was before the foundation of the world and you and i were in his mind at calvary and he said i'm dying for this one i'm dying for that one i'm dying for this one i'm dying for that one sure we know the bible says he died for the whole world but he knew who would and who wouldn't as according to that's right for knowledge you got to have foreknowledge before you have predestination but predestination is really simple to understand if you do if you take foreign knowledge first amen those who he foreknew he did predestinate okay so what it looks back that looks back to for now everything has to look back to foreign knowledge if not then you've just put him in a tube you know we just if paul's going to make it and freda's not i decided that god said no he didn't because you know what i'm just sorry you're sitting on the front row because what freda can do freda can go the white throne judgment said why did you say priest why did you pre-save him and not me because your bible says whosoever will you can take the bible back but to be a just god he knew one would and he knew one would not amen that's always bothered me for years how that god could take somebody's life early he's the only one that takes life right gives life and takes life how these young people live short lives and how that somebody like adolf hitler could live to a certain time and then then take his own self off the scene and him be just a horrible person you know what if you look at predestination by foreign knowledge he that if he'd let adolf hitler live for one million years adolf hitler would never come to a day of repentance therefore he could take him anytime he needed to because he knew that he could for he foreign you by infinite knowledge he said okay i'm going to let adolf hitler live for 80 years and then on his 81st first year he's going to accept me well god will let him live that long but he knew that he said well we'll give him 200 years we'll give him 300 years he knew he never would come to it so therefore he could take him anytime he needed to that's right so to me that's very simple showing that god foreign all these things what but what's it for it's for his purpose according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will and what the prophet of god tell us what his will is his will is his word amen everybody okay with that but i look at this next quote we know that the lamb and the heifer and all the different animals in the old testament could only push sin to calvary it couldn't eradicate sin god could remember what they did because it was only covered or capoed by the blood of an animal but when this god set up this plan amen when god set up this plan it was perfect right he knew he was going to have to create some blood create a human body and step into it listen to this but god before the foundation of the world foreign that jesus would come the perfect lamb of god into a perfect cell that god himself created to bring blood into the world to offer that blood there was billions of people in the world maybe at the time that were walking around with with plenty of blood they were all they were all people they all had a soul but they couldn't die for another man and then come back into that man and make that man the same man that died right right only god can do that that's right he for ordained that jesus would come the perfect lamb of god into a perfect cell that god himself created to bring blood into the world to offer that blood amen i love that what a plan of redemption listen it can't go wrong when you're the one handling the whole thing jesus was in total control god was in total control even at calvary jesus was in total control he says into thy hands i commend my spirit they didn't kill him at calvary he gave up the ghost the bible says amen he was in total control over the whole thing everybody right with that amen let's look in isaiah 7 verse 14. let's skip through the quote there on fellowship we all know that jehovah was a crying baby we know that god came with no teeth that god had to live over a manure pile when he was born we know that but watch this but it's fulfilling the old testament therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel and we know that what in isaiah 53 verse 1 this is a wonderful scripture because it all it only talks to one man jesus christ doesn't talk to nobody else talks to jesus christ who hath believed i reported to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground he has no form or commonness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire in other words he's a common man he is despised and rejected of men what about a man that was the creator of the world and they hated him the whole creation at that time hated him all mankind didn't like him except for a few he had twelve and one of them was the devil he was despised and rejected of men a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief if you ever get to wise you will as you would read the scripture okay you didn't go through nothing this man went through free nothing you didn't go through nothing this man went through for you he gave his life and then that life we know now that being almighty god that life can be transferred inside of me and you and that we could be as donny was we're reading this morning we can have the mind of christ you can't have the mind of christ unless you've got christ inside of you that's pretty simple surely he has borne our grief and carried our sorrow yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for wade dale's transgression he was bruised for way dale's iniquity the chastisement of way dale's peace was upon him and with his stripes way they was healed can you read it like that amen how personal is that he sent him to me he didn't send him to you he's he come to get me he didn't come to get you david's he didn't come get you you come get me but you got to realize he came to get you okay he got a real life make it personal all we like sheep have gone astray and we've turned everyone to his own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he didn't have a very nice life did he earthly life but you know what he didn't come down here for himself he came down here from me and you he came down here knowing that blood was going to have to be be shed and he was not to be slaughtered like a lamb he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before her shear is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off from the land of the living in other words he never had any earthly progeny he have never had an earthly genealogy when they hung him on the cross that was it man thought they had done away with him there was no way he could have a son that would raise up somewhere you know you read the bible where you have these kings you know and the kings have 15 or 20 kids and then one of them goes running off somewhere in exile or two or three go running off over here and then they come in and kill the king well all of a sudden here pops up the sun you know or he'll pop up with another son or here pops up another one you know but not this one because his earthly genealogy was not what he was looking for it was a heavenly genealogy it was a genealogy that was inside of him of his soul not his body because he gave his soul he made his grave with the wicked we'll read it right here verse 10. yet it please the lord to bruise him he hath put him into grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed see that's where we were we were we were his progeny by by not by man's loins we were his progeny by spoken word by the eternal life that was inside of him part of you today was inside of that man at calvary amen part of you was inside of that man when he went to hell and then on the day of pentecost he released part of that and he began having children and now look the church full of children today by what by the spoken word is the original seed not the other part when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed what a wonderful plan he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities now look therefore will i divide him a portion with the grape and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he what he poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with transgression and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors now remember when he came down here according to john 1 it says in the beginning was the word word was a big god and the word was god same was in the beginning with god let's go down to verse 11 save time he came into his own and his own received him not everybody with me but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god so it was for anybody even to them that believe on his name but remember we read here in jeremiah where he jeremiah 3 verse 8 says i saw when all the calls were by backsliding israel committed adultery i had put her away and give her a bill of divorcement they had went backsliding in the old testament so what did god do he put israel away israel was his first bride israel was the one he was supposed to come and get they were looking for the messiah and they weren't looking for a second person of a trinity either they knew that that jehovah then had went through the old testament and took the children of israel through the same jehovah that was going to come back amen that's why it's going to be so easy er for the 144 000 to see him over there because they believe in one god they don't have this trinitarian idea like we do here in the united states amen but jeremiah says i gave her a bill of divorcement romans 11 verse 25 now if you put her away he can't marry her as a bride again we're back to marriage in divorce he can't marry her again he's already put her away he can't marry her but he can marry another because you put his wife away he can marry again because of the adultery that she committed for i would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery that you should be wise in your own conceit if blindness in part has happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles be come in but now look and so all israel shall be saved now remember not every person right we know that not every person as it is written there shall come out of zion the deliverance shall turn away ungodliness from jacob for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins that's the daniel 70 weeks that we've been on for years and years and years that's very important to the jews it's important to us to know what's going on but it's very important to them because that's what god said he said 70 weeks are determined you're going to get 70 weeks or 70 times 7 490 years to come to repentance now the gentiles he's given us 2 000 years and we'll cover that in just a second for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins see he's going to he's going to save 144 000 when we get out of here gloria everybody got that as concerning the gospel though look they are enemies for your sake they hate us we're gentiles we're dogs we don't know anything about this jehovah god that they're talking about we don't know anything about this messiah that's coming right but the blindness that's why god had to literally blind the eyes of the jews so that you and i could come in amen he literally covered their eyes up and said i you i can't marry you again i've got to find a bride i can't marry you but i'm not going to forget you look as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sake talking to gentiles but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake he can't forget him but there's going to be a gap in there that we're going to come to in just a second and in that gap it's going to be me and you he's going to take a gentile bride because listen if it wasn't for the gentiles coming in and the promise of the gentiles coming in daniel 70 weeks would already be over because 70 weeks are determined and then we know when it started but what happened at calvary when he was cut off as isaiah 53 says cut off when his when he was cut off from the land of the living he didn't come back to save all the jews again he came back to get a gentile bribe all right everybody got that same man all right let's read daniel 9 verse 21 that's why it's so important that we see daniel 70 weeks that you and i are are included in this and it's part of the eternal plan of redemption okay they're part of it but you and i are part of it too and we'll show it to you in just a second how that works daniel says yes while i was speaking in prayer even the man gabriel whom i had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation anybody good with that he was praying and something happened and he informed me and talked to me and said oh daniel i am now come forth to give this skill and understanding at the beginning of thy suffocation the commandment came forth and i am come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision and what was daniel praying for let me just give you a background if you don't know what daniel was praying for daniel was saying god we have been in captivity for 68 years in two more years we're going to go free what's going to happen what's going to happen to us that's right well god's going to tell him you're going to get a release there's a king that's going to give you an edict that's going to say you can go back to jerusalem and start building your city and then i'm going to come but see they didn't believe that jesus was a messiah so you got to be careful with that so now look 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city so listen god not only listen we have no continuing city abraham is our father abraham was not a jew no abraham was not a jew he was a wanderer he wasn't jewish the father of our faith they talk about him all the time but he really wasn't so but watch 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and the city so god's going to give them a city to live in according to ezekiel 40 through 44 the only city me and you are promised is the one in revelations 20 whatever it is 21 or 22. when that city comes down out of heaven and sits over there in jerusalem that's our future home that's where we live that's not where the jews are going to live that's right and during the thousand-year millennial reign they're going to build a temple and they're going to live in that temple because they're temple builders remember when you die you don't lose anything you just travel to another place so 70 weeks are determined upon thy people now what is daniel's people though they're jews and thy holy city which is what jerusalem to do six things to finish the transgression make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity in other words he's going to save them the same way he saved you through justification sanctification in the baptism of the holy ghost he's going to save them just like he's going to save you but they will not be bribed they've lost that part of being bride they will be eunuchs or they will be temple subjects but they will never be bribed but he's not ever going to forget them either make reconciliation for iniquity bringing everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy and anoint the most holy look know therefore and understand it from the going forth of commandment to restore and build jerusalem so they're getting ready to leave wherever they're in captive in egypt or wherever they are and they're getting ready to go but remember you've got to have to travel from here to there you've got to have a some paperwork you got to have cyrus or darius or one of those kings to write you and eat it it says okay you can go rebuild your your temple you have my protection and you have my paperwork go build it well they started to do that and we've been through daniel 70 weeks with all the numbers but if you'll just read your bible right your bible tells you exactly what's going on right okay there's so much contention in the message of the hour about what brother branham said they just have never been taught right amen hey man they just never been taught right because you can't go against the bible right and the prophet never wins then you went against the bible so it's got to connect know therefore and understand it from the going forth or the commandment to restore and build jerusalem because remember it's to the people and the city everybody okay with that unto messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and three score in two weeks the street shall be built again in the wall even in trouble it's time if you'll read over there in habakkuk or somewhere they had a trial in one hand and they were building the wall and they had a sword in this hand because listen those people that lived around them knew if they got that temple built back again that god would be with them again so they took all they could and they would go and bombard that place trying to get that place broken back down again because they knew that the jews needed that temple bill and they finally got it finished but listen and after three score in two weeks shall messiah be cut off but not for himself now why was he cut off wasn't cut off for himself if you would pull that chart up please brother joe i missed the first one brother anderson sorry the second one the daniel 70 wheat one for those of you that have not been here we're doing this eternal redemption we started way before time and we had a timeline but this is the one and and brother bob did this so it and you know what to an untrained eye it looks a little confusing but uh most of us it looks beautiful because we know what it's saying all right so the the bible tells us that it would be seven weeks and 62 weeks now is that the bible read your bible if you don't look down six seven weeks and 62 weeks what's 62 plus seven 69 no half weeks one more time seven i'm reading bible seven weeks and 62 weeks that's 69 and then messiah will be cut off according to isaiah 53 he was killed at calvary in a.d 30. right everybody got that right no half weeks in here nope no half weeks because the big contention is is we've already had three and a half weeks and only three and a half weeks after the rapture well that's a lie that's right and i'll tell anybody who teaches this a lot anybody i don't care who it is because my bible says if you'll keep reading the bible says and after three score in two weeks shall messiah be cut off but not for himself why was he cut off for me and you then he shall destroy the city remember titus in 1870 destroyed the city right here everybody got that and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with the flood until the end of the war desolations are returned determine and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week now if we've had 69 according to the bible we've had 69 weeks to messiah then that this this gentile dispensation does not count anywhere in jewish time right right now go that way there's one week left after the rapture amen according to the bible he said no brother brown said three and a half you're not you don't know what he's saying right you don't know what he's talking about that's right we do because we've been taught well there's a messiah week of seven years three and a half here three and a half here but that three and a half is right here right right then you have the tribulation the bible tells us every bit of this it goes through because look and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week that's the 70th week now who is the he he shall confirm jesus didn't make this covenant to break it jesus does not make a covenant to break one right who makes covenants and breaks them the devil the prophet of god says that he is the antichrist the pope the whoever you all want to call it and you know what you and i are not here when that treaty signed right so we're gone in a rapture and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week what's myth middle after the prophets preached three and a half years there's going to be he's going to cause a sacrifice and oblation to cease and for the over spreading of abomination he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation and that determined shall be poured out upon the desolate listen the great tribulation is going to be man pushing buttons and killing people by atomic weapons not god god's going to allow it to happen but there'll be no listen after the 144 thousand going to rapture there's nothing here but demons there's no god here to save anybody there's no salvation for anybody you've got to die during this great tribulation and then what happens in ezekiel 40 to 44 there is a temple built he said i got find me somewhere in the bible where it says the wedding supper's three and a half years it's not in there it says the wedding supper of the lamb the prophet of god is telling you though that we're going to be gone right right here we're going to be gone in another dimension glory while this 144th listen we can't be here at the same time we got to be gone out of the way and then he's going to come back and preach 300 3 and a half years 1260 days they're going to take a rapture and whatever else happens after that folks it doesn't matter to me we're in glorified bodies right here we shall confirm the covenant with many for one week that finishes because remember what is god doing in the 70 weeks of daniel he's restoring the salvation of israel and the city so he's going to build that city back right here the temple that we're going to live in in the millennium for a thousand years but remember that thousand years is not for me and you yeah that's right right that's not a gentile listen why do we need a thousand years to prove we're gonna prove the sin curse is done right here hey man we're gonna prove it right here the same curse when you take a glorified body your sin curse is over glory and then we're going up here somewhere it doesn't matter to me but we're coming right back down here and we're just going to have what the prophet god tell us a honeymoon now does your wife work on a honeymoon no obviously you have fun during the honeymoon we're gonna have fun for that thousand years but somebody is gonna live that thousand years to prove the sin curse is over for that part of the world or for this part of what's coming out here anybody got that amen that's really simple if you want this chart uh it's about that big if you want it but but it's really neat how brother bob we kind of all got together and put all this together and it's it's wonderful if you know what you're talking about see see because the contention remember when remember this there was two things when the people started leaving the message there was two doctrines there was two things that they questioned brother brad ramon one was the cloud and the next one was daniel 71 they said he was wrong he was wrong he was wrong he was wrong well you know what they're wrong because my bible says that my bible says that 69 weeks has already happened and he was cut off for a 2000 year gentile dispensation and i went to school and i went to a little bit of college 69 plus one is what 70. that's why it's called 70th week not half weeks now there's only three and a half years of jesus ministry left because he's already preached three and a half here but that three and a half year ministry of jesus is right here he don't preach right here listen that is the wrath of god the destruction of man as we know it they are going to bomb each other to death the rocks are going to cry for them to fall on them and all these things you just don't want to be here that's right but no ma'am no sir the prophet of god wasn't wrong if anybody's wrong we're wrong right amen but the prophet of god told us face final resting place is in the word of god right everything you see and you if you see something that you think looks wrong that the prophet said or you read in the bible go to the bible and say god i need to know that's right and here we go again if you're born again he's obligated to talk to you if you're not he's not obligated to talk to you you'll be so confused to you know what you'll leave the message and you'll prove you're not born again just sorry simple as that it's time when we go quit playing you better believe this is the truth or god better hurry up and send you somebody else real quick because there's a lot of prophecy in the bible that's been fulfilled right now but remember when this man was cut off he's coming back in two witnesses but he sent john to the isle of patmos but let's read luke 24 46 jesus said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooved christ to suffer and derives from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem we know that the first part of of this holy ghost falling was on 120 jews but remember we read last week we read it again there were thousands downstairs 3 000 of gentiles you don't see that people don't read that far but you got to read that far that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem and you are witnesses of these same things now watch and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high now that word in dude means listen to this go up to the go to the next one strong concordance what happened on the day of pentecost 120 licks of fire yeah sunk into them people right it didn't it didn't fall on them it fell in them amen amen to put on clothes with clothes in a radiant or to sink into i like that there's the sense of sinking into a garment it didn't sink into a garment it sunk into human flesh and that's where jesus stood up and he said oh this is what i've waited on he said i told you to go to jerusalem and you'll be endued with what dunamis or power from on high to sink into i like that that little tongue of fire didn't stay with him the whole time it just disappeared brother paul went right down inside of him and it birthed 120 little jesus into the body of christ and there was the body that got started all right let's read this real quick acts 2 verse 1. that's where we're going to we're gonna look and see here and when the day of pentecost was fully come there was all with one accord in one place suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they appeared unto them cloven tongues like is a fire and it sat upon each one and they were filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and there was dwelling in jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noise abroad the multitude came together and was confounded because every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed in marvel saying one to another behold or not all these would speak galilean and how hear we every man in our own language you see they weren't speaking in tongues they were speaking in their own language but you were hearing them in your language the same thing is going to happen we're not going to need an interpreter in the future home you're going to speak english and whatever nationality they can't other people come from they're going to hear it in their in their language thank god and how here we every man in our own language when we were born parthians medes elomites dwellers in mesopotamia judea cappadocia upon us asia pergya pampalia all the way down into egypt libya cyrene about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes cretes and arabians do we do hear them speak in our tongue the wonderful works of god so after that day there was a gentile dispensation started three thousand people went out and proclaimed the gospel of god we don't know their names and it really doesn't matter god knows who they are but they spoke a language that the people had never heard before and then paul being the first church age messenger established the first church because of a promise now we know that that we we know that he went to the isle of patmos john did after paul had already died is everybody okay with that paul died in 80 50 something it was 80 90. but what was god doing god was showing john what was going to happen during the church ages and that's where i'm going to base this right here of what i'm going to speak right here just for just a few minutes i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in the book and send it to the seven churches now you say oh there was only seven churches now if there was only seven buildings yeah how far would that go no it was seven church ages it was seven churches right the people that were established in these churches it wasn't to just one little church send it to the seven churches which are in asia and to ephesus smyrna because see there are if you're regis church age book these are literal cities but they had a characteristic that each age had coming down through here and it what coincided with the messenger to that age okay because if listen if it wasn't revelations 1 10 through 20 and most people in denominational world don't even care about this it's just it was really too just a church and it was just a letter and it was just because they you know they they don't like that man thing even though wesley was the founder of the methodist church and luther of the lutheran church and all these different ones they have a problem with that we were talking about that one time in a methodist church they had asked me to speak and dad was there and one of our cousins walked up and said what do you mean when you talk about this martin luther and john wesley and all that stuff and and then i think dad's brother said well they just they're just man followers you know so and that's okay i started with me i don't care it didn't bother me it made me say lord help that blind person standing there but thank god he sent us a prophet but the reason he sent us a prophet is because of this right here because he promised us seven messengers with seven distinct different messages this is my point from today and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man that's god in human flesh likened to the son of man but he was clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with the golden girdle john was looking at this man he knew that was jesus he'd seen jesus he'd seen him in his lifetime in his literal lifetime he had seen him but now he sees jesus standing there clothed differently than when he was then why because he wasn't in bribe form then he was in jesus the savior for him then he was in what he was the son of man but now john sees this son of man standing in the midst of seven candlesticks and he's got a golden girdle dressed feminish bright form right so now it must click to john there's been an in morphing there's been a there's been a little bit of a change here now we've not got this man one man standing here we now have got one man standing in the midst of seven candlesticks and then that person listen to this saw one like into the sunny man glo close the garment down to the foot sorry i'm trying to get too fast gert about the pabst with the golden girdle his head and his hair was white as well now remember the prophet god explains to us that is what the judgment form the judge form he's in judge because who's going to judge the earth the saints right from from the church from when the first church started in ephesus to this church age there's your judge there's your judgment and his head and his hair was white like wall as white as snow in his eyes where his flames of fire and his feet was fine brass if they burned it in the furnace and his voice is the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars now look here's my promise god's going to send me a messenger he had his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went what a two-edged sharp two-edged sword the word and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength and when i first saw him i fell at my feet is dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth in with dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death look he's commissioning john write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my hand they were in the hand of the son of man now he was standing in front of seven golden candle sticks which is the seven church ages right but then he had a special something in his hand seven stars in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven church ages and the seven candlesticks what's thou saw us are the seven churches right now let's go to the greek lexicon this will be the last one to watch what is that star mean it's a messenger from god god had seven distinct different messengers in his hand so here's my contention if brother branham's not that seventh star god needs to send me one because he promised i'd have one in this last church age he promised me he had him in his hand now you think god's gonna let him go he had him in his hand and he gave paul irenaeus martin columba luther wesley william brown to give us what a message now we know that this messenger though here is our issue the issue that we have no well not us but the issue that people have is they see that god may have sent us a messenger to turn our hearts back and then we're just all become pentecostal and we're just supposed to shout and praise the lord and and and then the major doctrines come up of back then like no eternal hell uh all these different things everybody got that let's just talk here for just about five minutes all right that that is that's fine that's that's malachi 4 to restore the heart the soul the heart the soul to return our soul back to the faith of the fathers which was the original preaching of the first church age that's right amen everybody got that amen they didn't have an eternal hell message they didn't have a three god message they didn't have a baptism in the name of the father son holy ghost message they didn't have any of those messages that wasn't in their repertoire they didn't have even have notes for that amen but down to the church ages though man had eroded the messages that these preachers brought right maybe not so much during the time but shortly after they left they started eating again remember talking about restoration of the broad tree the devil started eating that what he can't eat the word away but it can eat the effect that it has right so the effect that it had during the church ages was that you believed and then you died luther was a trinitarian wesley was a trinitarian this last messenger was not a trinitarian but now we we love the first part where he turned the hearts of the fathers of the children children to the fathers so he turned us back babbling babies back to the what pentecostal to the faith of the fathers because the faith of the fathers paul peter couldn't say add to your faith virtue knowledge temperamentation god's brother kindness he had to have some of that to be able to tell us about his natural perfect man he had to have a few of those gifts or a few of those things that in his life why wouldn't peter peter was the worst one of all he knew god done something in his life he took that temperance away from him that's for sure and give him a lot more patience but then god sent we got to keep reading as i was telling brother daniel wednesday night we got to keep reading we can't stop at malachi 4. right right if we stop at malachi 4 yes he turned us back to the original faith of the fathers and that would have been it we'd had to have another church age and another messenger because god promised though in luke 17 30 that the son of man would have to return in the end time the son of man would have to be here like he was 2 000 years ago in our flesh to change this flesh so brother brown said then we look and we see and i got you just keep going you go to revelations 10 verse 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel if brother brown wasn't if he wasn't the voice we need to listen to god's got to send us one or you can take him to judgment on his word and say you didn't give me a chance you didn't you lied when you said you had seven stars you only had six right no god don't lie never has never will that's right he's given us a message we've already got it why look for something else and then the prophet of god tells us in the church age book he said this messenger of malachi 4 do two things one turn the hearts back to the faith of the fathers and and reveal the seven seals or the seven thunders that's not written in the book but reveal them so that you and i can take a body change and because there's no other church age there's no other messenger to come because if you say brother branham wasn't a church aged messenger god's got to send somebody and he better do it quicker he's going to raise sodom and gomorrah and apologize to everyone over all this felt that's going on now methodist church going to have homosexuals in their pulpit brother brown said john wesley was a firebrand snatched i believe if he came back and saw that it'd be some killing yeah he'd be more in a firebrand he'd take that firebrand and beat about half of them to death but you see how far man's got it away but listen satan's trying to do that my last point satan's trying to do that in this end time in this message he's trying to discredit and i want to say this one time one time only i don't care if william branham was false in his personal life or false in he wasn't out here at a certain time or he he said 2 000 and meant 4 000. what that man when i heard his voice that was the voice of god speaking directly to me glory and as i read you in ephesians it told me the mystery of his will i do not care about all that other stuff you can have all that garbage you want i'll take my stand that he is one that i listen to the voice of and that he's going to perfect that that perfection's going to come through that voice final voice to the final age why in the world would god send a anyway there's no way there's eight manifestations of god we know that but there's only seven church age messengers there's only seven church ages only seven church age messengers but god gave us a real good one in the end time but you know what it's like brother daniel said the closer we get to god the more you're gonna they're gonna call you the devil because listen if they called god himself that was the most perfect man to walk on the face of the earth he didn't have nothing to look back on he didn't have no lineage to say well i'm sorry because grandma no he was almighty god that's right and if they called him beelzebub they called him a wine bibber they told him they said why is your why is your master why is he around all these prostitutes and and all these republicans and sinners and jesus just looked at me he said somebody's well don't need a physician a physician is needed where people are sick well let me tell you something we might and that's why i love what brother brown god sent brother brown he sent the healing message first for the body he sent the healing message for the body because there was a lot of people healed under his ministry but from 1963 to 65 that's the message that's going to change mind and your body that's what's going to take us to another level and it's not going to just temporarily heal us i'm not looking for temporary healing that's great i love it but the healing of the soul is eternal it's part of this eternal plan and you and i are heading toward an eternal part in our body that's never happened before like brother donny said even jesus christ has not stood like that he had to die his body lay dead cold in the grave for two days when we take a body change ours will not have to but thank god i just read you he said i'm standing here with the keys of death and of hell he had the keys in his hand he had the seven stars in his hand and he was standing right in the midst of the seven church ages now you and i are the very end of that church age we're done we're finished it's almost over believe this message and i'm going to say it one more time if you can't understand this message you need the holy ghost that's the problem i see people are going because i shouted i've been i've got tenure for those of you that don't know what that means that means they've got vested time i've sat in a pew for 25 years and listened to brother so-and-so that don't mean squat to god you could be dead as a doornail but you get born again one time didn't god said he would give us the mystery of his will he'll not give it to the devil he can't give it to the devil's kids because they don't want it right they just want to shout and have a good time and oh this preacher he preaches so good that's okay but i want you listen if the son of man has come back into power we're going to take communion so we won't have the musicians come i was thinking about this last night we were talking about the son of man show me one time now if we look at the son of man ministry give me five minutes those of you that slept for thirty give me five more we look at this son of man ministering jesus christ never hardly ever raised his voice we think we need to have a real loud shouting meeting where we slap the people knock them down and throw them all over the place jesus walked up to legion and legion was asking him permission that devil was asking him permission to leave and jesus you know what jesus said he turned to look at him and said go boy now see a bait for the preachers in the end time they're over there grabbing him screaming and no the son of man ministry of supreme power brother brown said the most powerful anointing that ever was is when jesus walked in that temple luke four i'll bring you the quote he said jesus opened the bible and identified himself in the word he said that was the greatest anointing that ever struck the earth ever struck the earth was when he looked in the bible and saw who he was now what happened to me and you glory when we see who we are how many times have we quoted that when the bride realizes who she is and what she's doing here she will be an invincible army not that we can shout louder than the next person not that we can get this feeling or emotion but if supreme power in control to me is adoption where you know who you are you know what you're doing here and if something does come up and roll up against you it's like brother branham did with that man you know the man challenged him the devil's always wanting to challenge people but that's okay let him challenge but brother brown stood his ground and he told that he told that demon he said now this is not a this is not a fight of flesh in other words if i'd have been that man i'd left because right then i that man knew who he was talking to he was talking to that demon that was inside of that man he said you'll fall at my feet now he didn't reach and scream and shout no he said you'll fall at my feet jesus christ on this earth if we're back to the son of man message it's not going to be a pentecostal revival like people think i said like people think it's going to be but when we see the manifestation of god then we can shout and praise the lord knowing that it's the shout of the what king in the camp the king is here he's here to do what he's supposed to do we we will not have another messenger so if you don't believe this one and if you have questions about this one one more time if you'll get the holy ghost you won't have questions you know what look yourself in the mirror one day and say look if you don't have the holy ghost talk to yourself i want to know it look yourself in the mirror see i want to know it god you said you'd give me the holy ghost if i'd if i would ask you go through the process again get baptized do the things of god quit worrying about stupid stuff on the internet quit worried about somebody brother so-and-so i really don't care amen i'm like brother dick addison if they could prove that brother branham was an adulterer that would not bother me one bit he brought this message to me all that frivolous stuff does not mean one thing to me i've never wore a belt buckle i've never went fishing with him or wanted his knife or never wanted a part of his um floor that's relics he brought me to this yes this is what i'm gonna take me out of here not relics and it's okay i might not belittling brother rem you know that you know i'm not greatest man that walked on two feet besides jesus christ right but he's not my savior but i know what he did he brought me to my savior he didn't just bring me to my savior he brought the son of man god in human flesh not just to be beside a group of people he brought a word for to go in a group of people in the end time let's stand to our feet god bless you if you have a need you know what we've done before many times we've took communion and people have needs and they be healed when they take communion so let's bow our heads real quick and we'll go to the communion to heavenly father lord we thank you for this day that you give us and truly lord we're not trying to belittle anything except the devil i don't want him to have any part of this i want him to be uncomfortable i don't want him to have a place in this building because he torments us every day of our life but lord there's a time and a place where we come to this sanctuary lord that we can hear from you lord and not have to worry about all that other stuff out in the world and father we pray that you just bless each one lord forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make lord as we take this communion lord clear our clear our hearts out lord if it be any sin among us lord may we get it out now father confess it and get rid of it and let's take this communion and let it be something that that will help our bodies and help our soul lord that will take us and carry us into a rapture father we ask just to be with each one lord be with the ones that are traveling tomorrow keep them safe on the highways thank you for bringing brother paul sister freda through the wreck lord and bring them to church today lord what a testimony that is lord that you bring them here father and enjoy the service we pray now lord it should be with the lord as we get ready to head into these next couple of weeks of hustle and bustle that will not forget you that we'll pray before we do anything we'll have prayer lord even for the time coming up of our father's day fishing trip and the lady is going and then also the july meeting lord we thank you for giving us 50 years of being able to listen to you speak to us through the words of a fivefold ministry lord now as we look down at this scripture lord that we're gonna that we're gonna read in just a minute that will lord it won't be just words but it'll be a true communion that you broke your body and lord you you gave your soul a ransom to get us out of prison and father we give our life back to you lord be with each one lord under the sound of my voice if it be any sick here lord you said you sent the word and healed them and delivered them from destruction so lord i pray that that will happen just as we take this communion lord a solemn time that we are to honor you lord until the day that we are able to take it with you to marriage supper we look forward to that day lord we thank you and we commit all these things to you in jesus name amen first corinthians 11 for i have received to the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he breaking and said take e this is my body which is broken for you this due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drinking in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body unworthily just we have to be careful saying shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself yeah that's my brother there's an there's your way out right if you think you're unworthy at the moment there's a way out right here examine yourself and so let the meat of that bread and drink of that cup the prophet of god said if you got an art against the brother he said if you can't get to that brother he said you go ahead and take communion he said but you better go to that brother and get it straightened out our sister so so we're okay we're good right for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh domination to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with this world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat terry one for another and if any man hunger lady meat at home that you come not together into condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come he had come to the corinthians and they were just having a drunk feast they were brain they were just having a great meal and they were just all getting drinking and staying at the table and they were just saying this is the lord's supper no it's not the lord's supper right it was a solemn time he said when you come together to eat terry one for another so we're gonna tarry just a few minutes the prophet god said you pray for your pastor you pray pastor be praying for you and you pray for each other so let's bow our heads
