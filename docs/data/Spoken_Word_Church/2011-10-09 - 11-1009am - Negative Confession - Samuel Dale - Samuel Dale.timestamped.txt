[31:09] and be with us and guide us now as we
[31:11] read your word let your love be with us
[31:14] in Jesus name
[31:18] amen got one of those where did I
[31:21] thought I was set schedule to preach two
[31:24] Services I already had them laid out but
[31:27] had to pick up another thought because
[31:29] it came to me this morning and it
[31:32] relates back to the message on Wednesday
[31:35] so we will just do it oh George Danny
[31:38] Wade said don't worry about that get
[31:39] Hope on said me to make sure and give
[31:42] you that word okay Romans 8 we'll go to
[31:45] verse 26 and
[31:49] 27 likewise the spirit also help with
[31:52] our infirmities for we know not what we
[31:55] should pray for as we all
[31:58] but the spirit itself maketh
[31:59] intercession for us with groanings which
[32:02] cannot be uttered he that searches the
[32:05] hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
[32:07] spirit because he maketh intercession
[32:09] for the Saints according to the will of
[32:12] God now what is the will of God the will
[32:15] of God is his word okay we can read the
[32:17] whole chapter of Romans and and trying
[32:19] to Romans 10 to try to get to the point
[32:22] but let's go uh over and you have it up
[32:25] on verse 10 but we'll read verse 9 but
[32:28] if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[32:30] Lord Jesus Shall Believe in thine heart
[32:33] that God hath raised him from the dead
[32:35] Thou shalt be saved for with a heart man
[32:38] believeth unto righteousness but with a
[32:39] mouth confession is made unto salvation
[32:44] you may be seated the Lord add his
[32:46] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[32:50] I got to thinking about
[32:51] this
[32:54] uh and uh I'll get back to more into the
[32:58] message but I've been a thought's been
[33:02] on my mind about something for quite a
[33:04] while and what I want you to title this
[33:07] is a negative
[33:10] confession all right and I'm asking the
[33:14] question do we have a negative
[33:18] confession or a positive attitude come
[33:21] on that's right now which one is it do
[33:23] we have a negative confession so
[33:26] anything that is not
[33:28] positive all right anything that's not
[33:32] positive positive you understand me
[33:35] would have to be negative cuz there's no
[33:38] middle ground between positive and
[33:41] negative so anything that's not
[33:44] positive is
[33:46] negative but you understand what I'm
[33:48] saying see if it it may sound like it's
[33:51] positive you can say well that's
[33:53] positive you can you can take a car and
[33:55] you can say well we we've we've got a a
[33:59] a car here you know that according to
[34:01] the battery post it's showing that it's
[34:04] uh you know 12 14
[34:07] volts but if they can be a little bit of
[34:09] a problems maybe uh a dirty uh battery
[34:13] post or
[34:15] whatever see then it it won't
[34:19] transmit over into the car so a lot of
[34:23] times the car won't crank especially
[34:24] this new model stuff now the old models
[34:26] we we trying to get by but this new
[34:28] models takes at least 12 volts to crank
[34:31] so you know you can say well I've got 12
[34:33] volts on my battery meter here well it
[34:35] may not crank though because you you've
[34:38] got to have enough to get it to go so
[34:40] that's now that's my thought anything
[34:42] that's not positive
[34:44] positive will fall in the line of
[34:47] negativism all right so as everybody got
[34:50] the point now we'll try to get to the
[34:52] the point we're talking about all right
[34:55] because as we were we're trying to cover
[34:58] Wednesday I see another little buddy
[35:00] back there I don't know where he's been
[35:01] with us before or not but we say to him
[35:03] welcome and just be part of us too there
[35:06] was Sister Barbara all right now we
[35:09] speaking about this past Wednesday of
[35:12] what is
[35:13] death what is death right all right we
[35:18] found the best definition for or I
[35:22] did the best definition we can that I
[35:25] can find for death
[35:28] it's not going down to the Undertaker
[35:30] and seeing somebody Dead all right you
[35:33] know that's what we call death somebody
[35:35] dies we call that death but remember
[35:38] death was in the garden before Cain
[35:41] killed
[35:42] Abel all right death is what caused the
[35:45] problem that's what I trying to get
[35:47] across Wednesday see death in the garden
[35:50] caused a problem death is still facing
[35:53] you and I amen dying is naturally facing
[35:57] us all right you know dying going by the
[35:59] grave because of the
[36:03] death that's was in the garden and is
[36:06] stilling you and I no brother Dale I'm a
[36:10] Christian uh you know I'm a Christian
[36:13] and and all like that I I I'm a you know
[36:16] I've been a Christian in a long time
[36:18] well that's true but Paul said the life
[36:21] the enemy to be destroyed was death all
[36:24] right now is he talking about the life
[36:26] the enemy to be destroyed is
[36:29] dying that's part of it but see the real
[36:32] enemy that's facing you and I is the
[36:35] carnality of the mind because that's
[36:37] what happened in the garden it said I'll
[36:40] put
[36:41] enmity between thy seed and the seed of
[36:44] the woman all right now enmity is
[36:47] carnality all right so just translate
[36:49] that I'll put
[36:51] carnality I I'll give you a carnal mind
[36:55] and Paul said the carnal mind was that
[36:58] enmity amen division
[37:02] right we don't we don't need the carnal
[37:04] mind that's right and we have enough of
[37:07] that cuz that's where we live right the
[37:09] prophet of God would even State he said
[37:11] the biggest portion of our faith is
[37:14] mental
[37:15] Faith all right now hold on to
[37:19] it and it can become spiritual
[37:22] Revelation that's right but take any
[37:25] thought into it
[37:27] contrary to the truth it becomes a
[37:31] negative confession that's right no
[37:34] matter how positive you think you are
[37:37] amen and that's what I I try to tell you
[37:39] and I'm not throwing off on anybody
[37:41] we'll get into some things here but you
[37:43] see people that come up and they'll say
[37:45] uh you got
[37:48] cancer well then they they they'll go
[37:50] along a little while and they build up a
[37:51] faith like within them and they start
[37:53] saying you know I'm Healed I'm Healed I
[37:56] believe I'm Healed and as long as
[37:59] they're feeling good their confession is
[38:02] I'm Healed all right but then when it
[38:05] comes to the basis they begin to feel
[38:08] bad see then you see them weakening on
[38:11] their
[38:12] confession when it's really that's when
[38:14] you're supposed to keep saying I'm
[38:16] Healed because the prophet said you know
[38:18] that's the greatest sign that you're
[38:20] healed is for you to get sicker because
[38:23] your body is purifying the the situation
[38:26] you know it's having to pump blood it's
[38:27] having to do things uh your white blood
[38:30] count runs up and and it's fighting
[38:32] against all of the uh of the the enemies
[38:35] that's in the body but instead of that
[38:37] we start weakening down then after a
[38:40] while we say well well you
[38:42] know the doctor says I got cancer and I
[38:46] guess I do but then you're weakening
[38:49] down right so You' turned from a
[38:51] positive attitude or confession to a
[38:54] negative point right all right see why
[38:58] not just to start with say the doctor
[39:00] says I got
[39:02] cancer but I say by Stripes I'm
[39:05] Healed and then just keep confessing it
[39:07] now we're going to read the minute where
[39:08] the Prophet said say it out
[39:11] loud all right now we read in
[39:15] Romans get the point what I'm saying now
[39:17] we'll move on that death then is to
[39:20] reject the revealed
[39:24] word we something revealed to you and
[39:26] you go do it right you're dead that's
[39:29] right that's
[39:30] right like I told you about the man that
[39:32] that told me and said the Lord spoke to
[39:34] him get baptized in the name of the Lord
[39:36] Jesus Christ well he got a Methodist
[39:39] fell to baptize him and he baptized him
[39:43] both ways he said I said before you say
[39:46] anything I'm going to tell you how you
[39:48] got baptized and I Wouldn't Die you got
[39:50] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[39:52] Christ then you got baptized Father Son
[39:55] and Holy Ghost see I done it both ways I
[39:58] said no you erased
[40:00] it you erased your baptism CU you didn't
[40:03] believe that's right well see that that
[40:06] was then you can say well the Lord spoke
[40:08] I believe the Lord spoke to the man no
[40:11] argument but when he brought it over see
[40:14] he thought that satisfied the point and
[40:17] I said no sir I said the problem would
[40:19] have been you know if you have went and
[40:20] done to Father Son and Holy Ghost and
[40:22] then the Lord Jesus Christ might have
[40:25] been a different thing but you see water
[40:27] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[40:28] Christ and won't go do it then until you
[40:31] get that out of the way you're dying
[40:32] that's right now that's you know I'm
[40:35] just I'm not I didn't know who's going
[40:36] to be here or what's going to be and so
[40:38] you just take it for whatever now I'm
[40:40] just I try to preach whatever to to
[40:42] everybody that I can but this thought
[40:45] came to me that what we have is the
[40:48] biggest portion is a negative
[40:50] confession right now does everybody
[40:53] understand what I mean yes let me let me
[40:56] say it over again
[40:58] now negative is anything less of
[41:03] positive there is not a area gray we
[41:06] call it gray area between negative and
[41:10] positive because the the battery won't
[41:13] work if you don't have the right amount
[41:15] of juice it won't work it can be
[41:18] positive up to the certain point right
[41:20] is we'll get to it in a minute the
[41:21] prophet says keep saying it over and
[41:23] over amen that's right you know have you
[41:26] ever done that I've got these little
[41:28] things on the back of my neck they call
[41:29] glands and you know I go to the doctor
[41:32] and he looks at them he says they're not
[41:33] growing any I said okay fine no problem
[41:36] but you know every time I reach back
[41:37] there and wash or anything I said by
[41:39] Stripes I'm
[41:41] heal you say you do it every time every
[41:44] time I think of
[41:45] it I sure do it why because I'm going to
[41:48] say what he
[41:49] says because I'm a liar see you say no
[41:52] no no here's where we are now now
[41:54] brother if I say that I'm Healed and I'm
[41:56] not healed I'm a
[42:00] liar that's what I'm exactly
[42:04] say now listen what I'm getting
[42:07] there you say I'm a liar now you born
[42:09] one right you automatically one am amen
[42:14] anything contrary to positive is a
[42:17] lie now you're following me there's no
[42:20] no gray area in this time amen it's
[42:22] either positive or negative amen all
[42:26] right right now let's keep confessing
[42:29] till it
[42:29] comes you say I don't want to lie about
[42:32] being that I'm sick and I don't want to
[42:34] lie about it
[42:36] why are you lying when you say what God
[42:39] says God says you're healed am you're
[42:42] lying if you don't say What God Says are
[42:45] you following me but see anything now
[42:49] that we see and we reject that then we
[42:53] turn ourselves into death right
[42:56] it doesn't make no difference about what
[42:58] what it is or what cost it
[43:01] is there is no cost cuz God paid the
[43:04] price amen I'm just being blunt now and
[43:07] straight because see this was the the
[43:09] message I received and I didn't get it
[43:11] till this morning so I had to rewrite
[43:14] the notes and had a problem we did back
[43:16] in the back trying to get everything
[43:18] together to where I could change the
[43:21] message all right so now we get to Point
[43:24] anything to return down anything
[43:25] turnning down the revealed word it turns
[43:28] out to be death okay now and we read in
[43:35] Romans here
[43:38] that he makes
[43:41] intercession Upon Our
[43:43] confession amen now the Bible says as we
[43:46] read there believe in your
[43:49] heart right right confess with your
[43:53] mouth now leave either one of them off
[43:55] what have you done
[43:56] negative confession
[43:59] right so you're negative if you leave
[44:01] either one of them
[44:02] all you say well I believe in my
[44:05] heart well if you confess with your
[44:09] mouth well I done it secretly you know
[44:11] like say well I think I receive the Holy
[44:14] Ghost I don't want nobody to know it you
[44:16] know I'm keep no no it's like trying to
[44:19] put out a fire on a windy day and that's
[44:22] pretty hard to do all right but get what
[44:25] I'm saying
[44:27] now we first must
[44:32] confess the Lord Jesus
[44:34] Christ and believe in our
[44:36] heart that he saved
[44:39] us that's what brings us to Salvation
[44:42] amen all right now here's where the
[44:46] problem is we come through and we we
[44:49] start making our
[44:52] confession and we we confess that we're
[44:54] saved we confess that we're
[44:58] healed all right then things changes a
[45:02] little
[45:03] bit you know maybe having no problems
[45:06] and all at once you start having
[45:08] troubles and you start saying well well
[45:11] I I I wonder you know maybe I didn't get
[45:13] saved well you know what God's got to
[45:14] say what you say that's
[45:17] right now you following me this thing is
[45:20] not that God's going to override your
[45:23] confession right he's not going to ride
[45:26] your free moral agency
[45:29] right so whatever we say let's keep
[45:32] saying it
[45:34] amen it don't make no difference how
[45:36] sick we get keep saying
[45:39] it right I walk in the office the doctor
[45:43] there years ago you know and he done his
[45:46] test and said I'm going to take your
[45:47] kneecap off well I went in hurting I
[45:51] come out
[45:52] hurting I've seen many a day that I
[45:55] would have I would have loved to let
[45:57] them ride with somebody something that's
[45:59] why I started this riding by
[46:01] myself God I'd be riding with other
[46:03] people you know be cramped up in the
[46:05] back seat I seen a many a day I'd love
[46:07] to walk 10
[46:09] miles because my knees was killing
[46:13] me I wanted to get out and walk you know
[46:17] all right but you see when I went in the
[46:20] doctor said okay Sam proved it X-rays
[46:23] and all of it this is an orthopedic
[46:25] surgeon
[46:26] and he said we just have to take your
[46:28] kneecaps off at least that
[46:30] one I just looked at him and grinned I
[46:33] said you a taking my knap
[46:36] off he look back and gmed I like him
[46:40] really you know when he come in there he
[46:42] come in there with eating scrubs on the
[46:43] what you know what he come in Old par of
[46:45] ragged and clothes he was my style of a
[46:47] guy you know pain all over his shoes and
[46:50] pants and nothing like he been in there
[46:52] painting he was my kind of guy he just
[46:55] looked at and GRE he said well Sam we'll
[46:58] take them off I said you'll never take
[47:01] them off well I still got him that's
[47:04] probably about 30 something years
[47:06] ago and you know what I didn't instantly
[47:10] get
[47:11] healed you know what I'm saying
[47:12] delivered from the pain the problems
[47:16] and but I had made my
[47:19] confession now what if I had got home
[47:21] and I went back to another doctor
[47:23] because he wouldn't sign me out from
[47:24] work most of you know
[47:26] story so I had to go back to my family
[47:28] doctor to get him to sign me out a
[47:30] couple of days from work and he said Sam
[47:33] that gu knows what he's talking about
[47:34] he's
[47:35] a he's a professional you know he he
[47:38] he's a higher than I am and I said but
[47:42] listen I got irritated kneecap get me
[47:45] off my feet for a few days he said I'll
[47:47] give you two
[47:48] days he said I can't give you any more
[47:51] cuz if you got crippling arthritis like
[47:52] he says he said you sit down you'll lock
[47:54] up I have enough sense to realize that
[47:57] but I had enough sense to know too I was
[47:59] confessing God had healed me will you
[48:01] know what God healed me
[48:03] thank and lay up in the hospital down
[48:05] there with my back just to killing me
[48:07] and the doctor I finally begged him to
[48:09] let me off cuz we were scheduled
[48:11] Services here Friday Saturday and Sunday
[48:14] and uh but Mo was I I don't remember who
[48:17] come preach but anyhow the doctor he
[48:19] said if you'll go home and go to bed
[48:20] I'll let you go well I guess I kind of
[48:23] halfway lied to him I said I'll try to
[48:24] do what you say
[48:27] I went home got a heating pad come sat
[48:29] down in the
[48:30] Pew sat there Friday Saturday and Sunday
[48:34] you know what God heal
[48:36] me I'm trying to get you to see
[48:39] folks that's the point of what I want us
[48:41] to talk
[48:42] about we can take a negative confession
[48:46] and we
[48:47] can go right on doing what we're
[48:50] doing it's not no problem for you to say
[48:53] what the doctor says right right that's
[48:55] right well I'm honest that's where my
[48:57] wife she gets on to me all the time
[48:59] ain't no need going down there to the
[49:00] doctor where you talk I said well I talk
[49:02] plain go into the doctor's office and
[49:05] say he says what do you need Sam I said
[49:07] by I'm I'm I'm doing wonderful
[49:12] doctor so I finally changed the way of
[49:14] saying it I go in and say look
[49:16] everything's oky dokie except this coal
[49:18] I
[49:19] got all right so I guess I broke down to
[49:23] say it like it is maybe but you know
[49:26] like she says ain't going need to go if
[49:27] you're going to tell them you're okay
[49:28] well that's
[49:30] true so they when they look at me and
[49:33] it's green I go in and the the cancer
[49:35] doctor he walks in he's used to seeing
[49:37] all them patients is out there you know
[49:39] and the nurse she she lies herself to
[49:41] death that me because when I go in and
[49:42] she'll run up all this you know I said
[49:44] am I still
[49:46] living she said well according to all
[49:48] the signs you are so we just have a good
[49:50] time you know laughing and talking the
[49:52] doctor come in how you doing I'm doing
[49:54] wonderful and I told you Wednesday night
[49:56] about how that the the blood count from
[49:59] what they say I've got
[50:01] leukemia you know that's their business
[50:03] that's their
[50:04] machines but it went down it was on 22
[50:07] and it went to 40 and it started back
[50:09] down now it's on 14 Hallelujah that's
[50:11] only four points above normal
[50:15] for keep saying you
[50:18] heal don't take nothing contrary to it
[50:21] hey if you're sick take an aspirin come
[50:24] on go to to the doctor that's right you
[50:27] answer no I'm not hurting yeah you are
[50:31] yeah I am go on do what the doctor says
[50:34] as long as you're not contrary to the
[50:35] word of
[50:36] God all right just get off of that try
[50:40] to get on what I'm talk about but see he
[50:43] makes
[50:44] confession upon he makes intercession
[50:47] Upon Our
[50:49] confession all right now as long as our
[50:51] confession is right I was looking
[50:54] because I had to change this but R
[50:55] actually made a statement one time he
[50:57] said you're saved as long as you confess
[50:59] you're
[51:01] saved but he said you quit saying you're
[51:03] saved and you're
[51:05] lost oh that don't people don't like to
[51:07] swallow that one right but get what he's
[51:10] talking about that's it justification
[51:13] and
[51:15] sanctification you can be saved and then
[51:19] you can be
[51:20] lost according to your
[51:23] confession but once that baptism the
[51:25] Holy Ghost comes now right it's him
[51:27] confessing you're saved that's right
[51:29] it's not you saying it
[51:31] anymore all right so then he couldn't be
[51:34] talking about a born again Christian to
[51:36] be lost that's what we trying to get
[51:38] across Sunday about I mean Wednesday
[51:41] about
[51:42] death brother R said man fell from
[51:45] eternal life to death now how can you
[51:47] fall from eternal life to
[51:50] death they fell from eternal life to
[51:53] where they would went on to be made
[51:54] Eternal in Body Spirit soul and
[51:56] everything to death and went to the
[51:58] grave and that's what I told you you
[51:59] might not have liked it but I said we
[52:01] are in the same shape right now right
[52:04] we're in the same position they were in
[52:07] in the
[52:09] garden all right because you and I even
[52:12] though we're born again we can't lose
[52:14] eternal life no in the soul but we can
[52:17] go by the grave cuz that's our
[52:20] confession so let's start confessing
[52:23] what we are why can't we cuz he makes
[52:28] intercession Upon Our confession yes see
[52:30] if we don't confess it how can we expect
[52:33] God to do it right well I think I'm heal
[52:37] well that's all he can say I think you
[52:40] are right come
[52:44] on that's all he can
[52:46] say he saids whatever you think I'll
[52:49] confess it but see we're supposed to
[52:51] believe in the
[52:54] heart
[52:56] and then confess with our
[52:58] mouth so we believe in the heart and say
[53:01] what the doctor says with our
[53:03] mouth
[53:05] right come
[53:08] on we go to the doctors we're not
[53:11] against going to the doctors we're not
[53:12] against any kind of
[53:13] doing but when you're built on what the
[53:16] doctor says instead of what God says
[53:19] you're in
[53:20] unbelief I don't care who you are and
[53:22] what you're talking about you're an
[53:24] unbelief
[53:26] cuz the doctor he he just
[53:29] practicing amen all right but God is
[53:33] done and
[53:34] finished When God says we're healed
[53:37] that's finished amen all we got to do is
[53:40] say what he says and for me not to say
[53:42] what he says I'm a liar that's
[53:45] right don't ride on no tombstone that
[53:48] that that brother Dale died of so and so
[53:51] right on there he died saying he's
[53:53] healed amen
[53:56] is because I believe it let me confess
[53:59] it until it can take place cuz if I
[54:01] don't confess it what can do what can he
[54:04] make intercession
[54:06] upon right how can he make intercession
[54:09] upon anything that we don't
[54:11] confess but see we take a negative
[54:16] approach and that's why we're
[54:19] dying now come on I believe the message
[54:22] is
[54:22] here now down Through the Ages and
[54:25] time man confess the best they could do
[54:29] yes right yes but there wasn't enough
[54:32] that's what I wanted to preach this
[54:33] morning was that part of the message
[54:36] I'll get back to
[54:37] it see they wanted to confess it and
[54:40] they confess the best they could do
[54:43] right
[54:45] right Luther said I have eternal
[54:50] life he sa I just choose Luther cuz
[54:53] everybody argued and say they didn't
[54:54] have this
[54:56] I differ we totally Luther had the
[54:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost which is
[54:58] eternal life Wesley had it you know the
[55:01] people of that
[55:03] day and they were part of the body of
[55:05] Jesus
[55:07] Christ but they could not come to the
[55:09] change of the body
[55:12] why because now listen first off
[55:18] God had not brought the message
[55:22] right right right and that
[55:26] now listen don't you think Luther said
[55:28] by his stripes I'm Healed don't you
[55:30] think Luther said I'm Healed don't you
[55:32] think he said I'm saved don't you said
[55:34] don't you think that he read and
[55:35] probably preached that we' be changed in
[55:37] a moment in the twinkle of the
[55:39] ey come on don't you think that he
[55:42] probably preached about the Lord himself
[55:44] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[55:46] the voice of an archangel Trump he
[55:48] preached those things
[55:49] yes but what was it it was partial
[55:54] realization
[55:57] right right cuz they couldn't understand
[56:01] how that would take
[56:02] place when we're not in those days
[56:06] right if we're not if this is not the
[56:09] message we better find one right come on
[56:13] we're getting old you know
[56:16] what I mean we we've all set stood here
[56:19] and talked about and turned gray-headed
[56:21] right brother colie and turned loose
[56:23] headed some of us is coming
[56:28] out but you know there's got to be
[56:31] somewhere right that's true amen that
[56:34] somebody is going to start saying it
[56:36] that's right right amen and if we don't
[56:39] say it God can't bring it to P amen all
[56:43] right now so follow what I'm talking
[56:45] about
[56:46] now let's pull up number one
[56:49] Brothers e14 as I was with
[56:53] Moses
[56:57] look what he
[56:58] says let him that's weak say I'm
[57:03] strong watch you see just say in your
[57:08] heart I am now strong I have accepted
[57:13] Jesus Christ as my healer yes and never
[57:16] have a negative testimony anymore amen
[57:20] just believe it God is under obligation
[57:23] our Christ is
[57:25] sitting at the right hand of the father
[57:27] to accept you for he setting there the
[57:30] high priest of your confession to make
[57:32] good before the father anything that he
[57:35] died for it's your confession that he
[57:41] done all right confess
[57:45] it let the weak say I'm strong
[57:51] am you know what is our
[57:53] problems we think we're so educated
[57:57] revelated until we've lost the
[57:59] Simplicity of life that's
[58:02] right maybe I don't know how to say that
[58:07] but you take these guys that are what's
[58:09] known today called Faith healers and
[58:11] things like that we know they come off
[58:12] of the prophet's message but of healing
[58:16] but you know they're doing a good
[58:17] job and they get people to confess and
[58:20] they're
[58:23] healed
[58:25] and as we
[58:28] say how many times in here do we say I'm
[58:31] Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm
[58:34] Healed you know get caught up in the
[58:37] spirit of
[58:42] it but we sure get caught up in all of
[58:45] the world can't
[58:48] we that's right yeah we come to
[58:53] church I'm problem well that's right we
[58:55] all have problem we're hurting right
[58:57] we're human beings that's no problem we
[58:59] saying what's you're wrong with you
[59:04] right but when that's all we can
[59:12] say well that's all we can talk about
[59:15] that's
[59:16] right is what we say like I said now
[59:19] when we get to and you go down the
[59:20] stairs before we hit the bottom of the
[59:22] steps 75% of he was going to start
[59:25] talking about what the doctor said or
[59:26] the world says or something
[59:28] say I know that cuz you're human you're
[59:31] going to do
[59:32] it how you feeling I ain't feeling too
[59:36] good what don't you say praise the Lord
[59:39] I feel good I'm
[59:42] hurting I'm dying with P Glory
[59:46] Hallelujah I'm still alive sister Johnny
[59:48] said you st ain't down
[59:51] yet she used it a little bit different
[59:53] she said God woke me up this morning
[59:54] morning but you
[59:58] know B Church what are we talking
[1:00:01] about look the next
[1:00:04] one accepting God's Gift
[1:00:09] E9 Now read this real careful with me
[1:00:13] now healing is
[1:00:15] not are you reading it now something
[1:00:19] that you just
[1:00:22] say now read the whole thing but keep in
[1:00:25] mind what he's
[1:00:27] saying this is not the power of positive
[1:00:30] thinking right right where the little
[1:00:32] kid went down you
[1:00:33] know thought his mama was dead there's
[1:00:36] no power of positive
[1:00:38] thinking well yeah I believe it I
[1:00:40] believe
[1:00:41] it now that's all right if that's the
[1:00:46] best you can
[1:00:48] do listen to it just
[1:00:51] Mally or just say well I yes
[1:00:55] I I see it I believe that I accept it
[1:00:59] then if you accept it on those basis
[1:01:03] keep saying it over and over say it out
[1:01:09] loud say it over and over just keep
[1:01:12] saying I'm Healed I'm Healed say it
[1:01:15] until actually you believe it amen and
[1:01:19] when you believe it then it's going to
[1:01:21] take
[1:01:22] place amen
[1:01:25] but now stop confessing it what is
[1:01:28] it that's not a point right now don't
[1:01:31] have a negative testimony we read every
[1:01:34] time when you confess well I still feel
[1:01:36] bad today I guess you go right straight
[1:01:39] back in the same rut that you was in in
[1:01:42] the beginning
[1:01:43] right that's right now read
[1:01:46] it you say this is what the prophet said
[1:01:49] we we depend upon it well then here are
[1:01:51] simple
[1:01:53] things the what he says don't have a
[1:01:56] negative at testimony every time you
[1:01:59] confess well I feel bad today I guess
[1:02:03] you go right straight back in the same
[1:02:04] rut that you was in in the beginning
[1:02:07] there's not a man or a woman in here
[1:02:08] that is baptized with the Holy Ghost but
[1:02:11] what would start your confession I
[1:02:14] believe I've lost the Holy
[1:02:17] Spirit I believe it's gone from me they
[1:02:20] said you wouldn't do that I believe
[1:02:23] you'll go right down you will never
[1:02:25] you're not going to say you're
[1:02:28] lost right that's right
[1:02:31] right you're not going to say you're
[1:02:34] lost
[1:02:37] right well why can't we say the same
[1:02:39] thing about
[1:02:40] healing
[1:02:43] amen but you'll confess yourself totally
[1:02:45] out of your
[1:02:53] healing now now here's what I I get and
[1:02:56] I I I look at and I
[1:02:59] know sometimes God let people go through
[1:03:01] things to where that they can have a
[1:03:03] testimony well you you that have been
[1:03:05] here for any time at all you know the
[1:03:07] testimony this man has been that I've
[1:03:09] been sick in many
[1:03:11] ways and you prayed for me and thank God
[1:03:13] for
[1:03:15] that but you seen me walk through
[1:03:18] them with the same confession and the
[1:03:22] same
[1:03:22] attitude I am I'm
[1:03:26] Healed thank God for the doctors and
[1:03:28] what they can do but I'm Healed right
[1:03:32] now you got to admit
[1:03:34] that I'm not a preacher that stood up
[1:03:37] before you said well brother collie you
[1:03:39] feel well I'm feeling pretty bad too you
[1:03:41] know I just we just all feeling pretty
[1:03:44] bad you know we just all down and out we
[1:03:46] all just next just none of us ain't got
[1:03:49] nothing you know and you never heard
[1:03:51] that out of these lips that's right
[1:03:56] you've heard me confess
[1:03:59] it so you can't say people out there on
[1:04:01] the internet can't can't do it but
[1:04:03] there's one thing about it there's the
[1:04:06] people sitting in the
[1:04:08] congregation if there's anybody can get
[1:04:10] up and say that brother Dell has ever
[1:04:12] been down and out negative you have the
[1:04:14] right to do it right
[1:04:16] now so they they can hear it on
[1:04:20] internet you know I've been sick you
[1:04:22] know I've been through all kind of
[1:04:23] things
[1:04:26] but you know that I've been healed
[1:04:29] too you know my blood type has totally
[1:04:31] been changed from a neg a positive to a
[1:04:34] negative medically proven and that's
[1:04:38] impossible my eyesight was healed that I
[1:04:41] went 8 years and did not have to wear
[1:04:43] glasses I do not have to wear them now
[1:04:47] except for fine reading as far as
[1:04:49] reading this I can read it off this
[1:04:53] page
[1:04:56] so then don't think well now he's just
[1:04:58] up there you know telling us what we
[1:05:00] need to have CU he's now you see a lot
[1:05:03] of people do
[1:05:04] that a lot of people preach healing but
[1:05:06] they're the worst ones about going to
[1:05:08] the doctor that's ever been now I'm just
[1:05:10] plain
[1:05:14] okay always down and out at the mouth
[1:05:17] about something this man not down and
[1:05:19] out at the
[1:05:21] mouth
[1:05:23] right I've always tried to have a
[1:05:25] positive
[1:05:26] attitude because I'm going to preach
[1:05:28] positive you I need to be positive
[1:05:30] myself all right and not have a negative
[1:05:33] point about it look at the next
[1:05:38] one which is Jesus Christ the same
[1:05:40] yesterday today and forever
[1:05:43] E1 just the part you read what we got
[1:05:45] underlined and you can go let your
[1:05:48] testimony be
[1:05:49] positive every time you get sick and you
[1:05:52] were prayed for you go out and get a
[1:05:55] little sick you say well I guess I lost
[1:05:57] my healing then your testimony becomes
[1:05:59] negative and Jesus can't say no more for
[1:06:02] you he's the high priest of your
[1:06:04] confession sitting there making
[1:06:06] intercession on your confession what you
[1:06:08] believe right so you say
[1:06:12] well I guess I'm
[1:06:15] sick come
[1:06:18] on there nothing wrong saying you're
[1:06:22] sick the wrong long as where you take
[1:06:24] the wrong attitude about it and you
[1:06:27] confess what the doctor says that's
[1:06:30] right instead of what God
[1:06:33] says
[1:06:35] right come
[1:06:38] on look the next one blind
[1:06:41] B e44 your faith when you set in a
[1:06:45] meeting like this where the great powers
[1:06:47] and miracles of god was being done and
[1:06:49] the Holy Spirit moving the gospel being
[1:06:51] preached how are you going to stand on a
[1:06:52] negative confession
[1:06:56] now how you going to stand on if you
[1:06:57] word the word pre don't you want don't
[1:07:00] you want him to stand for you when I see
[1:07:02] those gates open you under and I see
[1:07:04] that every Sinner's got to go and Jesus
[1:07:06] sits right there in the road pleading
[1:07:09] for us not to
[1:07:10] go why don't we say what God says that's
[1:07:13] right when are we going to say what God
[1:07:19] says
[1:07:22] yeah skip the next one because it's a
[1:07:25] very long one but any of you wants it
[1:07:27] you can have it go down to number six
[1:07:33] brother confirmation of the
[1:07:36] commission and there he is the high
[1:07:39] priest to make intercession Upon Our
[1:07:40] confession when we accept his word
[1:07:43] believe it in our heart receive it in
[1:07:45] there and don't take back but believe
[1:07:49] exactly it's going to happen the true s
[1:07:51] of Seed of Abraham will hold on to that
[1:07:53] word word no matter how long it takes he
[1:07:56] will bring it to pass there's not a wave
[1:07:59] in in it nowhere he will bring it to P
[1:08:02] that's
[1:08:03] right make an intercession Upon Our
[1:08:07] confession not a negative
[1:08:10] attitude look at the next one have not I
[1:08:14] sent thee
[1:08:15] 1962
[1:08:17] 124
[1:08:19] e136 you got to believe it because see
[1:08:23] you can't make the word contradict
[1:08:24] itself it's got to run perfect just like
[1:08:27] them blocks and things it's got to run
[1:08:29] perfect one dove tailing with the other
[1:08:31] and you lap them over see you can't do
[1:08:35] it so Christ is perfect so his word's
[1:08:37] perfect now he's the high priest to make
[1:08:39] intercession Upon Our confession we
[1:08:42] confess of anything that he did for us
[1:08:45] he's there before the father to make it
[1:08:49] right let the redeemed say
[1:08:52] so
[1:08:54] let the redeemed say
[1:08:57] so listen let me get the last one let's
[1:08:59] just go to
[1:09:01] it perseverance number number eight
[1:09:05] brother let's go to it
[1:09:12] just now we find it find today it's so
[1:09:16] much on decisions you hear that all the
[1:09:19] time making decisions they what to do
[1:09:22] that's my brother R said Billy Graham
[1:09:24] said he goes in said he makes an all Rec
[1:09:26] call said he he goes to a meeting he
[1:09:28] said I had 30,000 here converts during
[1:09:31] this healing campaign I mean the the the
[1:09:34] uh Salvation campaign he said come back
[1:09:37] to year and don't have one or two
[1:09:39] maybe it's
[1:09:41] decisions why cuz you say you're healed
[1:09:44] you say you're sick you say you're
[1:09:46] you're delivered you say you're
[1:09:48] saved but then when things start going
[1:09:52] wrong
[1:09:55] I like what brother Gary's Daddy back
[1:09:57] there was a a
[1:10:00] doctor he was my kind of doctor because
[1:10:03] I like what he
[1:10:05] said first off he said we pray before we
[1:10:09] operate you
[1:10:11] know but he said if you can get to
[1:10:14] people said the first let's see I may
[1:10:16] misquoted this to her but he said if
[1:10:18] they told him in in college where he
[1:10:21] went to the medical school said if you
[1:10:22] can get the people to believe believe
[1:10:23] that they're you know they're healed of
[1:10:25] what are going on or medicine's okay for
[1:10:27] them something to that degree he said as
[1:10:29] long as you don't hinder them right said
[1:10:32] 80% of them will get well something like
[1:10:35] that maybe 50% or something say they'll
[1:10:37] get
[1:10:38] well all right brother said 85 so then
[1:10:41] he they told him out in the school right
[1:10:45] if you don't hinder him that's right
[1:10:47] they're going to get well huh well see
[1:10:50] then why can't we confess it praise the
[1:10:53] Lord
[1:10:54] yes decisions decisions he
[1:10:56] said decisions are confessions
[1:10:59] confessions are
[1:11:01] Stones what does good does it do to to
[1:11:04] pile up a bunch of stones if you haven't
[1:11:07] got a stone cutter who can shape them by
[1:11:09] the sharp two-edged sword of God into
[1:11:11] Sons and Daughters of God let them run
[1:11:13] around here with all kind of women
[1:11:15] dressed like a skin down Wier and call
[1:11:17] them Christians and Men letting them do
[1:11:19] it and then call themselves Servants of
[1:11:21] Christ the Church of lukewarm formal
[1:11:24] condition and all like that denying the
[1:11:25] power of God all right what we need is
[1:11:29] stones and somebody to cut
[1:11:32] them well like I said you can think what
[1:11:36] you want to about me as far as what I'm
[1:11:38] saying but I'm not one that's up here
[1:11:40] preaching to you about something that I
[1:11:42] haven't seen come to
[1:11:45] pass when I say God has
[1:11:48] healed I've experienced it right when I
[1:11:52] say God is saved I've experienced
[1:11:55] it I can talk about it right and I've
[1:11:58] preached it for 40 years
[1:12:01] now the people think you come along we
[1:12:03] got to have some kind of a positive
[1:12:05] attitude Brother D I agree if you
[1:12:07] haven't had
[1:12:09] one but my attitude ever since I come in
[1:12:12] this message has been very
[1:12:15] positive and I def gave you the
[1:12:17] definition of positive when I
[1:12:19] started anything less of positive is
[1:12:22] negative I've never had a negative
[1:12:25] confession about this
[1:12:27] message it's always been this message is
[1:12:30] right right
[1:12:32] amen whether or not I Know It Believe it
[1:12:35] or can produce it has nothing to do with
[1:12:38] it that's right because I know now since
[1:12:41] we know the message is right and listen
[1:12:43] to what I'm saying now we know the Bible
[1:12:45] is
[1:12:46] right we had misconceptions of the Bible
[1:12:50] right trinitarianism Eternal hells and
[1:12:52] all of that God we had all kind of
[1:12:55] except conceptions you know thoughts
[1:12:58] about it that it said there was three
[1:13:00] gods and and all these other things
[1:13:02] water baptism Father Son and Holy
[1:13:04] Ghost you see now we ought to be able to
[1:13:07] get to realize that those things was not
[1:13:08] right that was our
[1:13:11] ideas this message see has to be the
[1:13:14] same
[1:13:16] way our confessions must be right right
[1:13:20] let me confess it no matter what that's
[1:13:25] right whether I can produce it or not
[1:13:28] doesn't have anything to do
[1:13:30] with cuz see that's what people do they
[1:13:34] say let's see you produce
[1:13:36] it and I know you're not going to like
[1:13:39] this
[1:13:40] statement but I just stood here and
[1:13:42] testified of the many things that God
[1:13:44] has done in this old human
[1:13:46] body as to be healed of many different
[1:13:49] things that you witnessed
[1:13:52] it as a congregation you witnessed that
[1:13:55] so I'm not out here running my mouth
[1:13:58] amen that's right I'm not talking about
[1:14:00] what God can do I'm talking about what
[1:14:03] God has
[1:14:08] done looking at you and seeing many of
[1:14:10] you knowing
[1:14:15] that and seeing you come through many
[1:14:19] things right right see you face cancer
[1:14:23] and
[1:14:24] things and see you come through
[1:14:28] it
[1:14:32] right and sitting here knowing that
[1:14:34] there's somewhere around close to a 100
[1:14:36] of us and nobody's unemployed right
[1:14:42] now that's a miracle that's
[1:14:46] right that how we're all from all
[1:14:48] different ways of the world you know as
[1:14:50] far as the distances and things and
[1:14:53] different different situations but yet
[1:14:54] we're still have our
[1:14:55] job amen we pray for somebody to get a
[1:14:59] job you know when they get a job Jesus
[1:15:02] amen we pray for healing and people are
[1:15:05] healed just because God don't come and
[1:15:07] instantly do things then we begin to
[1:15:10] doubt what he's
[1:15:13] doing we begin to question him about
[1:15:15] things I'm talking about
[1:15:19] me now begin to say why
[1:15:22] Lord
[1:15:24] come on I'm human just like you we need
[1:15:26] rain right
[1:15:27] now desperately need
[1:15:33] rain well let's start saying it's going
[1:15:35] to
[1:15:37] rain and believe
[1:15:41] it you don't have to beg God for
[1:15:44] anything right that's our problem see
[1:15:47] then we we get into what we think is
[1:15:49] some form of you remember like brother
[1:15:51] brand said that when he first you know
[1:15:54] come trying to come to the Lord said he
[1:15:56] he seen people pray this way people pray
[1:15:58] that way and he said I tried every one
[1:16:00] of
[1:16:03] them he said I found out that wasn't
[1:16:06] what it
[1:16:08] was you know you don't have to beg God
[1:16:11] for nothing or plead with him just take
[1:16:13] him at his
[1:16:15] word
[1:16:16] right and stand on his
[1:16:20] word and believe it
[1:16:24] I always asked a question back some time
[1:16:28] ago said do you believe that we have the
[1:16:30] faith of the
[1:16:35] fathers I said
[1:16:41] yes didn't back off in the statement and
[1:16:43] don't back off today
[1:16:45] right
[1:16:49] yes later in a discussion I said I will
[1:16:52] go further than that
[1:16:55] I'll say we have the headstone
[1:16:58] bless
[1:17:01] amen now that doesn't mean everybody's
[1:17:03] got it if you understand what I'm
[1:17:06] saying that doesn't mean everybody in
[1:17:07] the building's got what I'm confessing
[1:17:09] right that's
[1:17:12] right it's just what I'm
[1:17:15] confessing cuz if you don't know what
[1:17:16] I'm talking about just it's hard for
[1:17:18] have what you you know have something
[1:17:20] that you don't know what I'm talking
[1:17:22] about
[1:17:24] I'm not saying everybody in the
[1:17:25] building's got the faith of the fathers
[1:17:27] I've never said
[1:17:31] that but I believe the faith of the
[1:17:33] fathers is hearing
[1:17:35] right well I just don't see it open your
[1:17:38] eyes amen what do you need I challenge
[1:17:42] you you do it all right I don't don't
[1:17:44] need a challengeing it's just let out in
[1:17:46] plain truth take the book of Acts which
[1:17:49] was about 30
[1:17:52] years
[1:17:53] it lasted at least up to the church age
[1:17:55] of of 853 so that would make somewhere
[1:17:58] close to at least 20
[1:18:00] years and you write down how many
[1:18:02] healings was done now listen I'm not
[1:18:06] blind I know the Bible of what it say if
[1:18:10] the things that were done were written
[1:18:11] the books couldn't contain it I know
[1:18:13] that come
[1:18:14] on but I'm just putting it out in plain
[1:18:18] language in the book of Acts you take
[1:18:20] the amount of healings that's done in
[1:18:22] the book of Acts and you lay them down
[1:18:24] in this church and see what's taking
[1:18:25] place we've seen the dead raised we've
[1:18:27] seen the sick healed I've seen
[1:18:29] everything except blinded eyes
[1:18:34] open it's on proof dead
[1:18:38] raised we don't have to argue we're not
[1:18:40] arguing with nobody cuz it ain't going
[1:18:41] to change nobody anybody out there on
[1:18:42] the internet ain't going to change you
[1:18:43] one bit for you to listen to what we
[1:18:45] talking about cuz I ain't talking about
[1:18:46] what's here I'm talking about what's in
[1:18:48] this around the world to the Bride of
[1:18:50] Jesus Christ as you'll believe right
[1:18:52] amen
[1:18:53] it's here for us if we'll accept it but
[1:18:56] if we don't start confessing it how can
[1:18:58] we have
[1:18:59] it now you tell me the answer to that
[1:19:02] one well when I see the signs and
[1:19:05] wonders I believe it you're an
[1:19:06] unbeliever and you always will be cuz
[1:19:08] it'll never come to that cuz you'd be
[1:19:10] looking at the book of Acts and saying
[1:19:11] the same
[1:19:13] thing God don't
[1:19:17] play he's healed and delivered and and
[1:19:20] guided us through the word amen
[1:19:24] but if we make a negative confession out
[1:19:26] of
[1:19:29] it I believe the faith of the fathers is
[1:19:31] here for the Bride of Jesus Christ I
[1:19:33] believe the headstone is
[1:19:37] here I believe the change is here amen I
[1:19:42] believe the Rapture is here
[1:19:47] Amen Let me at least say
[1:19:50] it cuz if not I'm negative
[1:19:53] right anything outside of
[1:19:56] positive well now one of the one day the
[1:19:59] Holy Ghost fell and they said this is
[1:20:07] that you know I'm glad you thought of
[1:20:11] that cuz what you're thinking is it took
[1:20:15] place right
[1:20:17] there now the man that said this is that
[1:20:20] wasn't the one that's right
[1:20:27] Peter was
[1:20:28] quoting right from Isaiah
[1:20:33] amen now what if Isaiah had not said
[1:20:37] words don't go back or I look for this
[1:20:39] is that come
[1:20:41] on Isaiah prophesied that one day and
[1:20:46] and uh Joel I'll pour out my spirit
[1:20:49] right that's right was a prophecy saying
[1:20:52] this is that he looked at it from where
[1:20:55] he saw it to him it was already there
[1:20:58] that's right that's the way a prophet
[1:21:00] saw
[1:21:01] things to him it was real when non saw
[1:21:05] chariots joshing in the street he saw
[1:21:07] Buick and O mobile running together
[1:21:10] running like lightning with headlights
[1:21:11] on he saw
[1:21:14] that but he couldn't go back and tell
[1:21:16] them Buicks and old
[1:21:17] mobiles he didn't know what the word
[1:21:20] was so he said chariot
[1:21:25] josin in the
[1:21:27] streets but when he saw that he said it
[1:21:30] you know what it could not have taken
[1:21:33] place in the book of
[1:21:35] Acts had not Jo Isaiah those prophets
[1:21:41] spoke of it before it
[1:21:44] came when are we going to start getting
[1:21:46] that positive about it when we going to
[1:21:48] get out of our negative
[1:21:50] confessions right well when I see I
[1:21:52] believe it believing is see it no it's
[1:21:55] not right Satan can
[1:21:59] impersonate what you can see that's
[1:22:03] right so don't go that route
[1:22:06] right let me say it's
[1:22:10] here and get out of my negative
[1:22:15] confession let me stay I'm Healed no
[1:22:18] matter what I've got to
[1:22:20] do let me say I'm saved this is what I
[1:22:23] said a moment ago we did it badly with
[1:22:25] healing but we we're we're more positive
[1:22:28] about our salvation and how can you be
[1:22:31] more positive about your salvation you
[1:22:32] can you heal
[1:22:33] it when both of them the same atonement
[1:22:40] amen come on both of them the same
[1:22:42] atonement sir when our transgression BR
[1:22:46] very NE try some heal same
[1:22:51] atonement you know what's wrong with us
[1:22:53] we won't say What God Says
[1:22:57] on we want to say what we want to
[1:23:02] say if we can see it well we'll we'll
[1:23:05] talk about
[1:23:07] it we'll tell you what you
[1:23:10] know but sometimes put it on the
[1:23:15] line put your own experience on the line
[1:23:21] right
[1:23:23] and say what God
[1:23:27] says it says by his stripes we
[1:23:33] are already done
[1:23:37] finished
[1:23:40] healed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:42] we are already sealed in the body of
[1:23:44] Christ amen when I told you it's 30
[1:23:48] something or 30 over 30 years ago I
[1:23:50] stood right here and I said I'm I'm
[1:23:52] telling you what I see that the biggest
[1:23:55] portion of the people of this message
[1:23:56] are going to die and go by the
[1:23:59] grave and I said I may be one of
[1:24:02] them but I'm just telling you what the
[1:24:04] Lord showed me because the people cannot
[1:24:07] stand on this what the word says they
[1:24:11] got to have some feeling idea or
[1:24:14] emotions or
[1:24:18] thoughts let me say
[1:24:20] it we're God can bring it to pass yes
[1:24:27] Lord but then if my life don't live up
[1:24:29] and back up what I've said then what I
[1:24:32] said is a blabbering
[1:24:34] mouth and not a confession from the
[1:24:38] heart I heard that preached in the
[1:24:40] Baptist so long until I used to I didn't
[1:24:42] even like to read Romans 8
[1:24:45] through1 why because it said like the
[1:24:47] prophet was saying he said not what you
[1:24:49] just say but he said if that's all you
[1:24:52] you got we read that a minute ago he
[1:24:54] said keep saying that till it comes
[1:24:56] right right biggest portion of our faith
[1:24:58] is mental Faith
[1:25:00] right speak it until it becomes
[1:25:03] spiritual
[1:25:06] Revelation say it
[1:25:16] amen that's why how many of you go to a
[1:25:18] doctor's place and tell them say you
[1:25:19] ain't taking my need help
[1:25:26] he just life and said I
[1:25:28] will I just laugh and said you
[1:25:33] won't and it's not always
[1:25:36] instant I walked in one day i' got where
[1:25:39] that I couldn't even shoot a gun with
[1:25:40] iron sights I had to go to a scope that
[1:25:41] was the purpose of going to cuz I
[1:25:44] couldn't see the sights they fuzzed
[1:25:45] between the two you know it just blurred
[1:25:47] up and I'd look out you under and it
[1:25:49] would just wave like that and just
[1:25:51] distance w eyes I was getting where I
[1:25:54] couldn't see good had to turn a had I
[1:25:57] don't know what was wrong with my eyes I
[1:25:59] I ain't doctor anyway but I had to turn
[1:26:01] a a book to read it I had to turn it
[1:26:03] sideways and kind of lean it right and
[1:26:05] then I could read I don't know what the
[1:26:08] difference was but I walked in the
[1:26:10] doctor's
[1:26:11] office I changed doctors eye
[1:26:15] doctors went to a different one walked
[1:26:17] into his office and he run the test and
[1:26:19] he looked at me he said what are you
[1:26:20] doing with the glasses in your pocket
[1:26:23] I said well doctor so and so gave him to
[1:26:25] me and I've been having trouble all
[1:26:26] these years and I can't read without
[1:26:29] it he said well you got
[1:26:35] 2020 you know what that second I had
[1:26:40] 2020 that was an instant one I walked
[1:26:43] out of that doctor's office and it so
[1:26:45] beautiful to be able to
[1:26:48] see Terrence was the only one that had
[1:26:50] better eyesight he used he used to he
[1:26:52] had what is it 1020 or something we'
[1:26:55] read signs going down the highway to see
[1:26:57] who could see them The Furs and tell
[1:26:58] clearity of it you know read them he
[1:27:00] could beat me on
[1:27:03] it but you see I went 8
[1:27:06] years today I can still see I
[1:27:10] chunk I just need a little glasses to
[1:27:13] help me read you know make things out
[1:27:17] right why because I believed
[1:27:21] it
[1:27:23] my blood pressure was running 180 over
[1:27:27] 110 170 180 to
[1:27:30] 110 GLE Motors I kept up with it for
[1:27:33] quite a
[1:27:35] while I went to the doctor before I went
[1:27:38] I came
[1:27:39] here and I said you pray that when I get
[1:27:42] there everything will be all
[1:27:44] right but when I got there and they was
[1:27:46] doing a physical and that nurse run that
[1:27:48] blood pressure thing up and she looked
[1:27:49] at me and she said my Lord what a blood
[1:27:51] pressure you know what I was expecting
[1:27:53] maybe 210 over
[1:27:55] 150 I'm like come on
[1:27:59] I but I had said God had healed
[1:28:03] me she run it up she just 120 over

[1:28:10] believe Friday I was on Monday I said
[1:28:12] would you believe Friday it was 170 over
[1:28:15] 110 she said
[1:28:20] no and doctor got through and come in to
[1:28:23] tell me about my physical cuz i' went to
[1:28:25] a new doctor he told me about my
[1:28:27] physical and he said wonderful blood
[1:28:30] pressure I said Doctor would you believe
[1:28:31] Friday that and for a long time it's
[1:28:34] been running 150 170 like that over
[1:28:38] 10010 he said no I went outside and I
[1:28:42] told my wife I said get me another
[1:28:43] doctor I will not go back to an
[1:28:48] unbeliever i good I ain't going to it
[1:28:52] I asked him are you a Christian or are
[1:28:54] you a Believer I only one I didn't
[1:28:56] answer that cancer
[1:28:58] doctor I looked right straight at him
[1:29:00] when he came in I said you can do what
[1:29:02] you want to doctor but I'm not taking
[1:29:04] your
[1:29:07] chemo he said well I got good news for
[1:29:11] you you don't have to Lord he said you
[1:29:15] got the kind you'll die with not die of
[1:29:18] I said I don't give a hoot what I've
[1:29:20] got
[1:29:23] I'm just only going to go so
[1:29:27] far why can't we have a positive
[1:29:32] attitude why can't we say God has healed
[1:29:35] us why can't we say God is has saved us
[1:29:40] why can't we say God has is here in the
[1:29:42] faith of the fathers why can't we say
[1:29:44] God is here in The Headstone why can't
[1:29:46] we say that the Bible has been fulfilled
[1:29:49] in this day we're living amen why can't
[1:29:51] we say the Rapture is already in process
[1:29:54] oh and I don't mean coming from 40 years
[1:29:58] ago that's where everybody wants to put
[1:30:00] it they wants to put it back there
[1:30:01] something coming why can't we say we're
[1:30:04] already
[1:30:05] changed and let God take it to P you
[1:30:08] know make it come to
[1:30:09] pass cuz he makes intercession Upon Our
[1:30:15] confession if we don't say it he can't
[1:30:18] do
[1:30:20] it now brother D you saying God that's
[1:30:23] no I'm just saying his Bible says it and
[1:30:24] if his Bible tells me that then that's
[1:30:27] what he said all
[1:30:29] right I'm not arguing with God nobody
[1:30:33] I'm just telling you the Bible says
[1:30:35] it if the Bible says it then that's what
[1:30:39] God said he said he made intercession
[1:30:42] Upon Our
[1:30:45] confession man believes in his heart
[1:30:47] confess with his
[1:30:49] mouth right but when are we going to
[1:30:51] start doing as I emphasized while AG go
[1:30:53] when are we going to start saying out
[1:30:58] loud I am
[1:31:00] healed you remember the man that was
[1:31:02] blind sitting in the barber's chair and
[1:31:05] for weeks he had been right on the
[1:31:06] street corner selling paper saying and
[1:31:09] he said I can see by Stripes I'm
[1:31:12] Healed you come in Old Barbara was
[1:31:15] cutting his high and doing said you know
[1:31:17] making light of him you know I heard you
[1:31:19] said just healed
[1:31:22] he said yes I am and I ain't seen about
[1:31:24] that time his eyes open he goes running
[1:31:26] out of the barber
[1:31:30] shop see our problem is we won't confess
[1:31:33] what God has said
[1:31:35] righten so don't ask me brother Dale do
[1:31:38] you think that we have this do we have
[1:31:39] that I'm going to say
[1:31:41] yes now brother Dale can you produce it
[1:31:44] that's a different thing right cuz I
[1:31:46] might not be talking about
[1:31:49] me but somebody has it
[1:31:55] right then why don't we just keep
[1:31:59] saying brother here one time wanted us
[1:32:01] to take a sister to up to a certain
[1:32:03] brother in the message CU he had heard
[1:32:05] about his doings and I told a brother I
[1:32:08] said if you want to go I'll pay your way
[1:32:09] and take you and your wife up
[1:32:13] there if that's what you want
[1:32:18] amen I said but when I get through and
[1:32:20] the man prays for her we're going to
[1:32:21] believe she's
[1:32:23] healed but man better not ask me do I
[1:32:25] believe what he
[1:32:27] says you know his doctor cuz I tell him
[1:32:30] right in front of the person being
[1:32:31] healed that I don't believe your
[1:32:33] Doctrine cuz it's not the
[1:32:36] word the brother told me he said there's
[1:32:39] no need to go in there same God is
[1:32:41] here if the same God is here why can't
[1:32:44] we believe the same God is here oh if
[1:32:45] brother Brandon was here to tell
[1:32:49] us so you see what everybody is waiting
[1:32:52] them that's right and I've never argued
[1:32:53] with anybody about the tent visions and
[1:32:55] the things I've told you what I
[1:32:57] said there's 30 40 days after the
[1:33:00] resurrection we going to sit around and
[1:33:01] look at each other oh the dead ra
[1:33:03] brother
[1:33:05] Marlo no we going to be shou and Glory
[1:33:10] Hallelujah because we're going to know
[1:33:12] it's a reality and brother random can
[1:33:14] preach 30 40 days to us that's
[1:33:17] right but he's coming out of the ground
[1:33:19] because somebody says he's coming
[1:33:23] he's coming out because somebody
[1:33:25] confesses it cuz Hebrews 11:40 says they
[1:33:29] without us cannot be
[1:33:30] made they can't be complete without you
[1:33:33] and I when are we going to start saying
[1:33:35] that and get away from our negative
[1:33:40] ISM get away from our little thoughts
[1:33:43] and ideas of
[1:33:45] this say What God
[1:33:48] Says keep say it until God brings it to
