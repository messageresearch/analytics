[0:05] so we're on matthew
[0:07] chapter five looking at the last
[0:09] attitude
[0:15] let's just read them off just for fun
[0:18] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[0:19] theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed
[0:21] are they that mourn for they should be
[0:22] comforted blessed are the men they shall
[0:24] inherit the earth bless you
[0:27] blessed are they which do hunger and
[0:28] thirst after righteousness for they
[0:30] shall be filled blessed are the merciful
[0:33] for they shall obtain mercy blessed are
[0:34] the pure in heart for they shall see god
[0:38] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[0:40] shall be called the children of god
[0:43] and finish it up with
[0:45] this one should all i
[0:47] is maybe one of my favorite blessings
[0:49] because
[0:52] once you become a christian i think
[0:53] everything's
[0:55] uh everything's supposed to be
[0:56] hunky-dory and then people begin to
[0:58] speak bad about you
[1:01] ridicule you and
[1:03] all my stories we could all tell
[1:07] but jesus said blessed are ye blessed
[1:10] are they which are persecuted for
[1:11] righteousness satan for theirs is the
[1:14] kingdom of heaven
[1:16] blessed are you when men shall obey you
[1:18] and persecute you and shall say all
[1:21] manner of evil against you falsely for
[1:23] my sake now all the other ones all the
[1:25] other blessings just had one verse but
[1:27] this one actually has two verses
[1:29] it goes into a little bit more detail
[1:31] it's not just blessed are they which are
[1:33] persecuted for righteousness sake for
[1:35] theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:37] but he expands it all out
[1:39] blessed are you when men shall revile
[1:41] you
[1:42] and persecute you
[1:44] and shall say all manner of evil against
[1:46] you falsely
[1:48] for my sake
[1:49] that's the key right there not because
[1:51] you you know if you get pulled over for
[1:53] a speeding ticket
[1:55] and you really were speeding
[1:57] then uh right
[1:59] it's your fault
[2:03] but if if you're ridiculed because of
[2:06] your stand for christ that's what this
[2:08] is talking about
[2:09] rejoice and be exceeding glad
[2:12] for great is your reward in heaven how
[2:15] how much joy we should have if we're
[2:18] ridiculed if we stand so close to christ
[2:22] that others hate us because we stand for
[2:24] christ not because of our own problems
[2:27] for so persecuted they the prophets
[2:30] which were before you
[2:34] now that last the last verse
[2:37] covers three abuses revival persecuted
[2:40] so say all manner of evil against you
[2:42] reviling verbal abuse the first one when
[2:45] people just say
[2:46] uh just say all kind of hateful things
[2:49] about you
[2:50] and
[2:52] persecution
[2:53] persecution means to harass trouble or
[2:56] molest
[2:57] the systematic mistreatment of an
[2:58] individual or group by another group
[3:02] now i was looking for the quote where
[3:03] brother and said brian can't persecute
[3:04] brian
[3:06] he must have worded a little bit
[3:07] different than i remember because
[3:09] um
[3:10] i know what's in there but i couldn't
[3:11] find it and but it should be pretty
[3:14] simple to see that if you're in this
[3:16] group if you're in the group that's
[3:18] under the shed blood then you won't
[3:20] persecute other people because
[3:22] persecution
[3:23] is
[3:24] the mistreatment of people that are in a
[3:26] group that you're not in
[3:28] so
[3:29] looking out
[3:30] you know when uh my wife said just
[3:32] yesterday she was walking through a
[3:34] grocery store and somebody was laughing
[3:36] at her because of the way she dressed um
[3:38] and
[3:40] she and esther got to talking about just
[3:42] when you're just going out in public
[3:45] the the life that you live is an example
[3:48] for other people
[3:50] and i remember um
[3:52] i i've got a lot of people don't know
[3:54] this but i have a degree in art and uh
[3:56] when i was in art school i
[3:58] my senior project was painting i painted
[4:01] these large paintings of elijah going up
[4:04] in the fiery chariot and
[4:06] um
[4:07] daniel and the lion's den and all these
[4:09] biblical scenes and every day this
[4:12] fellow that uh
[4:14] maybe
[4:15] could only be characterized as a
[4:17] sodomite if you catch my drift would
[4:19] come in
[4:22] and make fun of me
[4:24] and uh
[4:25] i just keep fading away
[4:27] but uh it's that that kind of thing he
[4:30] wasn't making fun of me because he was
[4:32] making fun of me because of what i
[4:34] represented because i was painting
[4:36] picture bible characters and bible
[4:39] scenes the things that meant a lot to me
[4:41] because i was a christian
[4:43] he uh
[4:45] he treated me that way now
[4:48] and then the last one
[4:50] the third one
[4:51] defamation of character now this is
[4:54] really interesting one this is when you
[4:56] think this is
[4:58] maybe hits the hardest to a christian
[5:00] because you think
[5:01] i want to live so close to god that
[5:03] other people can see god in my life
[5:05] and then somebody comes along and says
[5:08] you ain't even a christian you're you're
[5:10] uh
[5:11] you're not living the life you're not
[5:13] doing what i expected christians to do
[5:16] you know they even called jesus the
[5:18] fullness of the godhead body they said
[5:20] he was the devil
[5:22] and uh if they'll dwight he said if
[5:24] they'll do that to him
[5:26] our father what will they do to us
[5:31] and um
[5:32] i was reading this story of
[5:34] polycarbonate
[5:35] the early the romans they began to
[5:39] they started a smear campaign against
[5:41] the christians because the christians
[5:43] we only believe there's one god and the
[5:45] romans served many gods
[5:48] so because christians didn't believe in
[5:50] those other gods they started they
[5:52] started a smear campaign by calling
[5:54] christians atheists if you can believe
[5:57] that so polycarp when he was drugged
[6:00] before the uh the council all the people
[6:03] were claiming for his for his blood for
[6:06] his death and they said uh
[6:09] polycarp
[6:11] say make your confession away with the
[6:13] atheist meaning the christians and
[6:15] probably turned around and said
[6:17] he looked at all the people that were
[6:19] screaming for him for his blood and said
[6:22] yes away with the atheist
[6:25] because uh what they were saying
[6:27] accusing him of
[6:29] they were really guilty the guilty party
[6:32] and that's that's the theme all down
[6:34] through history the ones that are the
[6:36] true christians they'll say they'll
[6:38] speak ill of you and say that you're not
[6:41] what they think you should be
[6:46] and what it is is
[6:48] looking uh the the the theme of
[6:52] persecution is they people have their
[6:54] own idea uh and brother brandon call it
[6:56] their manual that they take the church
[6:58] manual the denominational manual and
[7:00] look at that instead of looking at the
[7:02] word in the smyrna in churches he said
[7:05] um
[7:06] instead of taking the word they took
[7:08] their own ideas and did just what every
[7:10] age has done
[7:12] substituted the manual for the word just
[7:14] to step outside that manual and see what
[7:16] happens
[7:17] you are out brother and they will
[7:19] persecute you and blame it on god
[7:27] so this is what this is a little a
[7:29] picture of persecution the believer is
[7:31] in this group and the persecutors are
[7:34] outside of that group and that's why
[7:36] they persecute you john 15 18 20 if the
[7:38] world hate you
[7:40] you know that it hated me before i hated
[7:42] you
[7:43] if you were of the world the world will
[7:45] love his own because you are not of the
[7:47] world but i have chosen you out of the
[7:48] world therefore the world hateth you
[7:51] remember the word that i said unto you
[7:53] the servant is not greater than his lord
[7:56] if they have persecuted me they will
[7:58] also persecute you
[8:01] if they have kept my save
[8:03] they will keep yours also
[8:08] now
[8:10] so bride can't persecute bride
[8:12] but uh
[8:14] along the life of journey like a lot
[8:16] look at paul's journey a long life road
[8:19] he started out persecuting the true
[8:21] believers and then when he uh was
[8:24] converted
[8:25] he became the persecutor
[8:27] so in acts 9 this is a couple of verses
[8:30] before
[8:31] he met the pillar of fire and saw yet
[8:34] breathing out threatening and slaughter
[8:36] saying just the first thing that was in
[8:38] that beatitude out of his mouth went i'm
[8:41] i'm gonna kill him against the disciples
[8:43] of the lord went unto the high priest
[8:45] and desired of him letters to damascus
[8:47] to the synagogues that if he found any
[8:49] of it of this way
[8:51] whether they were born they were men or
[8:53] women he might bring them bound unto
[8:56] jerusalem
[8:57] then after he met the pillar of fire
[9:00] then he became persecuted persecution
[9:02] age letter and empty persecutions
[9:04] afflictions came unto me at antioch
[9:06] and
[9:07] is where the jews rose up and and uh
[9:09] convert turned all the people against
[9:11] him and remember when they left the city
[9:12] they kicked off the dust from their feet
[9:15] and then iconium they began to uh start
[9:18] talking about how they were going to
[9:19] stone him and that list listener they
[9:21] actually did stone him and drug his body
[9:23] outside of the city and left him from
[9:25] the dead but god raised him up and uh he
[9:29] went forth now you think if at the very
[9:32] least if you're stoned and throwing it's
[9:34] throwing stones as you suffer from brain
[9:35] image or something but god raised him up
[9:38] perfectly and uh
[9:40] persecutions i endured but out of them
[9:42] all the lord delivered me and that's the
[9:44] key
[9:45] i leave them all the lord delivered me
[9:48] the footsteps of the order are righteous
[9:50] so order the lord everything
[9:52] happens for a purpose and further on
[9:55] down we'll talk about what the purpose
[9:56] is persecution has a purpose for the
[9:59] christian it's it's it's a big blessing
[10:02] because if you don't if you don't suffer
[10:04] persecution you won't reach the full
[10:06] potential
[10:07] yay and all that will live godly in
[10:09] christ jesus
[10:10] shall suffer suffer persecution they'll
[10:13] laugh at you for the way you dress
[10:15] they'll laugh at you for uh talk about
[10:17] the church you go to
[10:19] um
[10:20] talk about the way you live why don't
[10:22] you uh
[10:23] go out to bars uh and things that at
[10:26] work well like everybody else does
[10:29] you can just go on
[10:31] they single you out
[10:32] for righteousness sake first uh
[10:36] see first peter 2 18 20 service be
[10:39] subject to your masters with all fear
[10:40] not only to the good and gentle
[10:43] but also to the thrower
[10:45] now i put this in here because
[10:48] it's so important that when you are
[10:50] persecuted how your your reaction should
[10:53] be that's right godly toward uh the
[10:55] people that you know if you've got a an
[10:57] evil master or whatever
[11:00] it not don't be good just to the uh
[11:03] don't serve your masters just the ones
[11:04] that are good but also serve the ones
[11:06] that are forward
[11:10] piece of ceiling for them
[11:14] so this is thankfully if a man for
[11:17] conscience toward god and your grief
[11:19] suffering wrongfully
[11:21] for what glory is that if when you be
[11:23] buffeted for your faults you shall take
[11:25] it patiently i get never pulled pull
[11:27] over for your speaking to you because
[11:29] you really were speeding that's there's
[11:31] no glory in that if you uh
[11:33] put little halos over your head look how
[11:35] pious i am
[11:37] but if when you do well and suffer for
[11:39] it you take it patiently
[11:41] this is acceptable with god
[11:45] that persecution is just part of
[11:47] following god
[11:48] philippians 1 29 for unto you it is
[11:50] given in the behalf of christ not only
[11:52] to believe on him
[11:54] but also to suffer for his satan
[11:57] so let's go through real quick and look
[11:59] at how believers were persecuted all the
[12:01] way from cain and abel kane
[12:03] killed abel and why did he kill him
[12:05] because his own works were evil and his
[12:08] brother's righteous
[12:09] in genesis 37 39 it tells the story of
[12:12] joseph who was his his brothers hated
[12:15] him the ones that
[12:16] joseph wasn't doing anything evil he
[12:18] just told him a dream about how the
[12:22] all the sheep and wheat bowed down
[12:25] to him
[12:26] and so forth and they threw him in the
[12:28] well
[12:31] and moses
[12:34] god sends a deliverer and all the
[12:36] children physically do is speak evil in
[12:38] exodus 5 21 they said unto him the lord
[12:40] look upon you this is the people of the
[12:42] children of israel telling moses the
[12:44] lord look upon you and judge
[12:46] because you've made our savior our
[12:48] offering to be a poor in the eyes of
[12:49] pharaoh in exodus 14 11 and they said
[12:52] unto moses because there were no graves
[12:53] in egypt that stopped taking us away to
[12:55] die in the wilderness
[12:57] wherefore has still dealt with us thus
[12:59] with us to carry us forth out of egypt
[13:01] and and so on on exodus 17 the people
[13:04] child with moses and said give us water
[13:06] that we may drink this is when he and
[13:09] and the story and access when he got
[13:11] told to smite the rock and he smote it
[13:13] and moses cried on the lord saying what
[13:15] shall i do under this people they be
[13:17] almost ready to stone
[13:19] to stone their deliverer
[13:23] and then elijah
[13:25] who was also hated in first kings 18 17
[13:27] it came to pass when ahab saw elijah
[13:29] that ahab said unto him art thou he that
[13:32] troubleth israel first kings 192 then
[13:34] jezebel sent a messenger under elijah
[13:36] saying so let the gods do the million
[13:38] more also if i make not my life is the
[13:40] life of one of them by tomorrow about
[13:42] this time
[13:44] and then micah the king of israel said
[13:46] unto jehoshaphat there's yet one man
[13:48] micah the son of him love by whom we
[13:51] make we may inquire the lord but i hate
[13:53] him for he does not prophesy good
[13:55] concerning me but evil
[13:58] we're in good company when we're
[14:00] approached
[14:02] and their approach for the cause of the
[14:04] word 1962
[14:06] brother said you always have to stand
[14:08] this reproach in order to give your
[14:10] testing to see
[14:12] every man that comes to christ must
[14:14] first be child trained for the purpose
[14:17] that god has ordained before
[14:19] and remember if you can just keep quiet
[14:21] remember if he has called you for this
[14:23] there's nothing that can keep it from
[14:24] happening there's not enough devils and
[14:27] torment but what's got what god's word
[14:29] will be made manifest
[14:31] you're born for a purpose and nobody can
[14:34] take your place you might have
[14:35] impersonators everything else
[14:37] but they'll never take your place
[14:39] so persecution serves a purpose
[14:43] in acts 5 40 41
[14:47] after the uh peter and the apostles this
[14:50] is when gamaliel testified that uh if
[14:52] they're if they're really oh god let's
[14:54] just hold on and see what happens and uh
[14:57] they turned them loot before they turned
[14:59] the move state they beat them and to him
[15:01] they agreed when they had called the
[15:02] apostles and beaten them they commanded
[15:04] that they should not speak in the name
[15:05] of jesus and let them go and they
[15:07] departed from the presence of the
[15:09] council rejoicing that they were counted
[15:11] worthy to suffer shame
[15:13] for his name
[15:15] i think about that
[15:17] when you get all down about things
[15:19] people say
[15:20] that um
[15:21] it's a great blessing
[15:23] to be so close to god that you can uh
[15:28] that you'll be persecuted
[15:31] romans 5 3 and not only so but we glory
[15:33] and tribulations also knowing that
[15:34] tribulation work with patience right
[15:40] abraham's covenant confirmed 1961.
[15:45] uh
[15:46] we'll skip on down but you have to have
[15:47] a bad one to make a good one shine out
[15:49] you have to have a night to appreciate
[15:51] the daylight
[15:52] everybody say come be a christian if
[15:54] everything will go all right no sir it
[15:56] doesn't for a christian
[15:58] all that live godly in christ jesus
[16:00] you'll suffer persecution you've got to
[16:02] be laughed at and make fun of them
[16:04] stomp that keep that make fun of it they
[16:07] call the master of the house bills but
[16:09] how much more would they call them
[16:11] of his disciples
[16:13] so
[16:15] what does persecution do
[16:17] first of all it makes you pray
[16:20] when
[16:23] and
[16:24] things are going wrong at work and stuff
[16:27] boy you can you know sometimes you feel
[16:29] like i don't really know how to pray but
[16:31] when things are going wrong you can
[16:33] really it makes it easy to pray
[16:36] the pressures of life are on you
[16:39] and then it fortifies your faith like
[16:41] brother brown was talking about when
[16:42] reverend uh best uh challenged him and
[16:46] that the time when the pillar of fire
[16:47] came down
[16:48] and he said that people from all
[16:50] hundreds of miles away came around came
[16:53] believers from all around came together
[16:56] to uh
[16:58] because they believed
[17:00] what brother branham was standing for
[17:02] and they wanted to uh that's the next
[17:04] one draws believers closer together and
[17:06] fortifies you by your faith because they
[17:08] they believed
[17:09] what was being stood for and you know
[17:12] when people say something uh negative
[17:14] about what you believe for that that
[17:16] ain't true um now that's kind of out of
[17:19] a different class and then persecution
[17:21] because you know a lot of times we'll
[17:22] have our own little disagreements and
[17:23] stuff among us but um
[17:26] but when that happens if i if i say i
[17:28] don't you know show me that quote where
[17:30] brother rem and such then it makes you
[17:32] go back to his word and study and and uh
[17:36] check things out and fortifies what you
[17:38] believe so you really know what you
[17:40] stand on like uh
[17:45] thinking back to when it started being
[17:47] been spoken
[17:48] people began to speak about how jesus
[17:50] wasn't god until the river jordan
[17:52] well uh it made me go back and
[17:55] well
[17:56] they're saying it with conviction let's
[17:57] go make sure that brother brown didn't
[17:59] say didn't say that and sure enough he
[18:02] didn't
[18:03] say it like that
[18:05] and it draws believers closer that's
[18:08] what this is what it should do when we
[18:10] uh when we're
[18:11] we're down and out and
[18:13] people are saying things about one of us
[18:14] we should all come together and buy them
[18:17] closer and
[18:19] and so many times brother brown talked
[18:20] about
[18:22] as persecution gets stronger as they as
[18:25] they
[18:26] talked about when they close the church
[18:27] doors and everything then it should make
[18:30] us draw closer together and the little
[18:32] pity differences that we all have
[18:34] amongst each other then they they fall
[18:36] away that's right
[18:39] then we start getting closer closer to
[18:41] god and closer to one another
[18:46] in the restoration of the bride tree
[18:50] and that's the way mockery laughing
[18:52] making fun of a christian what it does
[18:54] is
[18:55] persecution shapes the christian to make
[18:57] him pray more
[18:59] dig down get a better hole so he can
[19:01] stay in the storm he's talking about how
[19:03] the little tree gets blown not blown by
[19:06] the wind but it just digs its roots in
[19:08] deeper
[19:12] an early spiritual experience is 1952
[19:16] when persecution you'll forget whether
[19:17] you're a methodist or baptist or whoever
[19:19] you are when the persecution rises
[19:21] and communism sets down the church of
[19:23] god will run together stoned by stone
[19:25] your little differences will be all
[19:27] forgotten there
[19:30] and then he talks about river and best
[19:32] when everybody came from five or six
[19:34] hundred miles that day to stay with him
[19:37] together we stand divided we fall all
[19:39] the way christian so if every one time
[19:41] we ought to stick together is now that's
[19:43] down
[19:46] persecution and trials are a natural
[19:48] normal part of the christian life
[19:50] there's only one thing you can do about
[19:52] it commit them all to god
[19:55] judge not
[19:56] and leave their outworking and final
[19:58] judgment
[19:59] to him
[20:01] and then this money and church agent
[20:02] said his approval of any of us is only
[20:05] in the beloved is the love is elected
[20:06] which he had for us before the
[20:07] foundation of the world
[20:09] does he love us
[20:11] he's talking about uh
[20:13] you know don't think that you're not a
[20:15] christian because things aren't going
[20:16] good and don't think you are a christian
[20:18] because things are going
[20:19] don't don't look at the outside
[20:22] how things are going in your life
[20:24] to see whether you're a christian or not
[20:26] but when we know we're a christian
[20:27] because how do we know we shall know
[20:30] because he said so and manifest that he
[20:32] didn't love us for he
[20:34] brought us to himself and gave us of his
[20:36] spirit placing us as sons and how shall
[20:38] i prove my love to him
[20:40] by believing what he said and by
[20:42] conducting myself of joy against the
[20:44] trials that he has wisdom allows to come
[20:46] past
[20:48] that's the end okay
[20:52] thank you
