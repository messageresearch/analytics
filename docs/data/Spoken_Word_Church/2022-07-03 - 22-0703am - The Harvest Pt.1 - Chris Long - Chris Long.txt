morning amen pleasure to be in the house of the lord with you thank you musicians greetings in the name of the lord from our home church there in cottonwood arizona and and uh of course we bring greetings to you also they'll be uh i'm gonna say greetings to them because they're gonna be on a three-hour delay this morning listening in just probably after the service is over but getting it off of the the youtube is that right is that what that's called amen does everybody feel all right i'll tell you what i feel good i may not look good but i feel good let's just take our bibles and we'll just read a portion of scripture just to get things started it's going to be in saint mark chapter four if you would i have uh i've been kind of preaching on a long-running series but it's it's it's been it's it's got little mini series is in it and it's about the harvest time i believe we're there with all my heart and if you've got saint mark chapter four we'll do verses 26 through 29 and get you seated there's no reason for an introduction you all know me i'm your brother in christ and glad to be so yes amen you got your bibles you ready all right verse 26 and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that the full corn in the ear but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because the harvest is come let's pray father lord this morning just reading a portion of your word lord is is sufficient but father there's something inside of us father that's yearning and longing lord for something more than just the reading of the word lord and that would be father the revelation of it we're asking now that the holy spirit father would be so kind lord and that we could to be in a position to be inviting to you lord to come into our hearts father that we could see father the meaning of your thoughts behind these words always for your honor and your glory lord privilege to be here in jesus christ's name amen god bless you may be seated now i'm not going to do a lot of backgrounding i want everybody to know that in this series i'm calling it i suppose i i was led the way from the beginning of it until recently i i i began to uh see something in the in the in the revelation of these things that um brought me to what you and i have been um have been told is called the tent vision now it's not just a tent vision it's a it's a series of events uh brother branham being taken from one place to another to another he even goes so far as to say he goes from one dimension to another right and and and you might think well that's a strange uh way to to come from the harvest to to a tent uh a vision or this this vision that brother branham speaks about starting in 1956 is when he first starts to tell about it but but as i was preaching on harvest and and i started out with uh with the the the former and the latter reign and then somehow god turned me to uh several messages on trying to do god a service without it being his will and of course it seems like well that's odd you know what's that got to do with harvest well you know god does everything mathematically i don't know if you realize that or not but but he is perfected in threes and and um of course as i began to to minister on on the harvest and then the the crop the seed and so forth it it it dawned on me that there was a correlation or there was a connection all right um do you believe we're at harvest time if you don't i want you to turn if you if you're if not if you don't believe it but if you just don't quite see where we're at in time i want you to turn to revelations chapter 14. okay we'll start there um and i'll do the best i can to convey this to you the way the lord give it to me you got revelations 14. verse 14. and i looked and behold wait a minute hold it you got a scofield bible raise your hand what's it say above verse 14. vision and we're talking about a vision now vision of armageddon it says and i looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle and another angel came out of the temple crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud thrust in thy sickle and reap for the time has come for thee to reap for the harvest of the earth is ripe and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth and the earth was reaped and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he also having a sharp sickle and another angel came out from the altar which had power over fire and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle saying thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripe and the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of god and the winepress was trodden without the city and blood came out of the wine press even unto the horse bridles by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs now brothers and sisters i read that because i want you to see we are at harvest time we're on the verge of armageddon do you realize that the people the governments of the world and all of these leaders and the military minds are all thinking that this invasion by russia of ukraine is the beginning of armageddon no doubt now there might be there might come a lull there might be there might come a space a time where where superman steps up and says safety the bible tells us when that man does that we're there we're real real close now you say well brother chris i've been hearing that for years but have you been seeing it for years you see modern events are made clear by prophecy so that means that prophecy makes modern events more clear because we're beginning to understand these things and you'd go back maybe if you're uh if you're a follower of the end time message and you and you'd pick up the visions that god gave the prophet back there in the 30s you know how how how getting up to the place where the automobiles would change you can go through all the other ones but let's come right down to the day we're living and he said he saw a family in a vehicle we all know this and it looked like they were playing checkers well he didn't know what a video game was so he just called it checkers and it looked like they were moving things around on this screen and nobody was driving the car oh yeah boy ain't that the truth well ain't nobody driving the car they're busy texting yep see him going all over the road you know from side to side and then the in the rumble strip and my wife says watch out for that one you know they're texting yeah so you kind of hurry by him and you peek over and sure enough they got they got the thing up here on the steering wheel and they got the knee down here and they got their big mac over here and they're doing it anything but driving so we're there we know that the last part of that vision was was a woman and then the united states potholes i hit a few yeah on the highways but these aren't just potholes now these are craters it's coming we're not that far off so then i begin to ponder harvest time it's time for the harvest let's see what the prophet says and i'll and i'll give you uh i'm background in just a little bit but i want you to understand i've been thinking about the crop that's coming up and how that it would be so close at the end that it would deceive the very elected because there are two spirits working right now we'll use all of the different things that god put at our disposal uh by way of a prophet so the first thing i'm going to read to you is out of harvest time there are several places in here where uh the prophet of god gives us some indicators but i want to read you this one first of all here brother branham says he has no idea why he's naming this particular message harvest time but he's going to preach it anyhow he says remember the bible said in the mouth of three witnesses let every word be established we'll get on that in a few minutes on the three temptations of jesus the three temptations of ministers today where they make the fall three temptations of the church and where they make their fall three temptations of an organization where it makes its fall and three temptations in the individuals and where they make their fall now it all runs in threes like justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost father son holy ghost everything is perfected in threes he says now we all know that but i just want to reinforce that and i want you to notice that when we read out of revelations 14 if you follow it close you're gonna see that it's in the mouth of three witnesses this vision of armageddon and what's going to take place all right now what got me now now now i'm gonna i'm gonna move i'm gonna fast forward what got me over here into what we term our title as the tent vision was the definition of harvest so i look it up and again i'm i'm beginning to see something so where i came from from the uh from the from the the former and the latter reign and coming into uh the the trying to do god a service without it being his will was was the was the indication by the prophet that there's a separating time coming now now there's there's this and brother wade and i talk about these things another minute there's this there's this strange ecumenical movement beginning to go on uh maybe you all aren't aware of it and you don't have to be but but i can tell you that there's two spirits and one of them is so close so close that it would deceive the very elected if possible so that's close now so again using that thought i began to think about what the prophet said about the stock the tassel and the shock right now that's the growth of a plant we'll use wheat as our example the bible talks about a corn of wheat no it's not corn and wheat it's a corn of wheat all right corn is another term for germ or grain all right and so pondering these things and meditating and ministering on them and little bits and pieces here and there i get to the word harvest and i notice that what what what the prophet of god i could read it to you right here out of because because people stumble over these things they say well aren't we supposed to be one well yes we are but one with what one in what we're supposed to be one with the word amen so it is the word that does the separating and that's the reason why there was a fall in the garden of eden with the first church eve amen the enemy knew that if he could get the word separated in the mind in the belief in the spirit and heart of that church that we call eve he knew he had a chance and it was an ecumenical separation it's very interesting isn't it that there are all kinds of things in the world today that people are calling antichrist yeah the prophet of god informed us that it has to do with christ or it wouldn't be preceded by the word anti it's got to be because people say well it's the back then the nra and and and today the nra and different nra um okay and and and and and and putin and and and and ching and the guy over in korea and he'd just go all over the place vaccine tattoos you know but we have been given the inside track because we believe god sent a prophet now we may not understand everything that prophet said but we know because of the infallibility not of the man but of the gift that god used through the man that undeniably but there are people that are denying it but to the believer undeniably that man was a man of god yes sir now i want to bring begin to bring a little separation if you let me watch what he says anointed ones at the end time oh you false teachers ouch listen you say well that's that's uh td and this guy and that guy and this guy and esca did it oh no he says listening to these tapes oh now it's brought it home now oh you false teachers listening to these tapes listen now this ain't some guy that just put a tape on for 10 minutes and said that's not that's that's not a god i don't believe that we don't teach that all these years oh you false teachers listen to these tapes all these years come on now this is going to be so close that it would deceive the very elected if possible this is getting real close in it and seeing watch this not just listening and seeing god confirm exactly what he said and you set in your study and no it's the truth oh they know it's the truth they've listened they've seen they've studied this is the truth but because of your denominational differences now i understand the way the way the way folks are because i'm just like you denominational differences what is that you say well that's methodist that's baptist it's presbyterian that's this that's that oh oh oh you have you ever looked up where the word denomination came from you're all assuming it's a church oh no it it comes from a latin root meaning the value of a name right want that to sink in the value of a name that's why you can be a one man or woman denomination in your pew because people will put more value on theirs or someone else's name outside of the name above every name amen what is the name above every name it's the lord jesus christ so then any entity anyone any thought any way any doctrine amen any church any so-called believer who thinks that they have some small alternative idea see i'm putting the heat on now because i'm telling you folks you're looking at a man who believes the infallibility of god's word and the infallibility of the word of god that came through the prophet i didn't say the prophet was infallible i believe jesus christ was infallible but that's because that was the word made flesh right and we are being taught today that we are being put in a position by god to begin to become the same thing that jesus christ was the word made flesh that's why you always hear written epistles read of all men that's what we're supposed to be coming the only way we can do that is by allowing ourselves to fade off the scene and for the word of god to become preeminent through and through amen now it seems like we spend an inordinate amount of time looking at the enemy and his tactics and the negative side i'm reading what the prophet said i'm going to tell you why this is in here and i'm going to tell you why we have to be warned constantly before the fall there was only one warning don't touch that tree amen amen you can do anything you want you can eat anything you want you can go anywhere you want you can fellowship with anybody you want to don't you touch that tree because in the day you week thereof that's the day you die amen but because of the fall and because of the fallen nature that you and i all of us together come into this world through we have to be constantly warned constantly focused constantly told the tactics of the enemy and the enemy today is so close amen so close that it will require the spirit of god and the discernment of god in order to be able to differentiate between friend and foe now we not i'm not preaching a separation from foe the way you think i'm preaching a separation between what made them a foe amen there you go you understand that you know the old saying love the sinner yeah hate the sin yeah you'll get it listen careful all these years seeing god confirm exactly what he said and you said in your study and know it's the truth and because of your denominational differences you dispute them why would a man want to dispute the truth when he knows he sees he hears it's the truth and tell your people they're not so whoa unto you he says your time is close at hand listen balaam people say who bala balaam was a prophet he's there's prophecies still coming to pass we're told that balaam prophesied anointed with the same spirit see how close it is that was upon moses oh girl come on now then then don't you think that with this statement i just read to you that balaam believes he's co-equal with moses how come everybody's listening to what moses said and ain't nobody listening to what i said because your teaching's off babe you are a gifted you're anointed you you you are a man that god can use and has used and will use but you've been taught wrong are you with me the teaching of moses he says what was the difference the teaching of moses was perfect you get that do you believe that say amen amen but moses wasn't perfect moses didn't even get to cross over into the promised land because smote the rock twice bible said here in ii peter that it was the teaching of balaam that israel received that god never did forgive never did forgive what does that mean unpardonable sin ouch no chance not one of them got saved though they had come out under the blessings of god and seen the hand of god moving by this mighty prophet and seen it exactly vindicated by god and because another prophet come in with a teaching contrary and disputed with moses and tried to prove to the people that moses was wrong can't you see brothers and sisters we're here we're at the harvest time well i want to take you a little deeper into the harvest if you let me through god's word dathan gore and many of them agreed with him listen agreed with him and taught the children of israel to commit fornications there's another portion of a message i preached during this series called the oxen stumbled trying to do god a service without it being his will the ox and stumbled does anybody in the room know what the ox is a type of pastors the oxen stumbled and it caused an innocent man who saw it happening to try to to try to level up and and and steady the cart the cart was wrong too you understand that's what's going on that the two spirits would be so close it would deceive the very elected so the oxen are correct but they were not the things that god chose to move that ark that's why there's a pastoral breakdown going on why because they're stumbling why are they stumbling because they were not ordained to carry that word it was god's selected elected ministry that he hath placed and chose and if it is god's ministry they will not try to do something with the word of god out of place yes right amen they will not try to do god a service without it being his will they will endeavor to do everything they can for the lord in his will and what is his will oh that's see i i get comfort there yeah i feel good do you do you feel good if you've got if you get your comfort from god's word right now you're saying praise the lord you know kind of like that woman that come out there and say oh praise the lord brother branham you get everything tonight and she walked off and one man said yeah you hit everything but gossip yeah because she's the biggest gossiper in the church see so brothers that's why it was good little little message we heard this morning from brother aaron see i'll be checking up all the time now you don't have to constantly be running back the blood of jesus christ let me tell you it's so powerful right amen now when i first got saved i'm telling them this is this is a true story i had a binder paper and several uh notes in a notebook long and i come to the pastor about a week later and i said sir i said i've got to make some things right he looked at the i mean i'm not kidding this happened in his office he's looking at the list and he's wow man you're going to prison that's what he said he said you you try to do you try to make all this up you go into prison and i said well i feel in my heart that i should go back and make everything right i'm going to tell you he did have some wisdom let me pass it along to you he said brother he said the blood of jesus christ so powerful that everything you got written down on there is white as snow he said but if you listen thank you if you listen to the message future home he says you're going to find out that that just took care of the past sins what you're doing today brother that's it now you got to start making it right everything you did before let it go the blood of jesus christ is that powerful and it continues to be that powerful but now you got to make it right i haven't even got to the definition of harvest yet but i'm working there let me let me get this let me get this out of the way listen close nathan corey many of them agreed with him they agreed with balaam and taught the children of israel to commit fornications to go after his organization that's committing fornication that we're all the same think about it think about the mantra that's going on today oh come on we're all the same well if there's nothing wrong with shaking a hand and giving a hug and going out to lunch but we're not all the same some of us are going to stand on every word of god no matter what the cost no matter what our family says no matter what our church says no matter what our co-workers say no matter what the government says we're gonna stand and there's a price to pay amen for standing right amen did you realize that it took our lord to calvary [Music] amen listen to what he says we are not the same whether we're methodist baptist presbyterian or pentecostals or what more we're all the same we are not the same listen now you are a separated people holy unto the lord dedicated to the word and the spirit of god to bear fruit now we're at harvest time to bear fruit of his promise of this day you say brother chris what is the promise of this day power of god chicago illinois 10 6-55 what is it a revelation amen what is faith listen now listen to the definition the prophet of god gives of faith is god what is faith is god i like the start of this definition by the spirit revealing to you something that he's going to do or he's promised that's it that becomes brothers and sisters whether you realize it or not the fruit amen of this harvest because because faith is based upon those things that you cannot see hebrews 11. you can't see them but yet you believe they exist in such a way where they're actually tangible i could feel it yeah but i can't see it you don't got to see it with these eyes you got to see it with something in here what is that that is the fruit of the harvest it's the fruit off of the tree of life you see the tree of knowledge of good and evil requires tangibility something you can see taste feel smell hear and once you can do that then reason affection memory conscience and so forth begins to enter in but if you take god at his word now i've probably said this here before and i'm going to say it again because it's just come to me you know how the devil got even the garden of eden the devil got even the garden of eden by asking her where is your fruit you see i've been procreating here for quite some time young lady and look at my family but i don't see your family and god's word says replenish and multiply where are you doing it like wendy bagwell eve lost your faith she didn't realize that everything is predicated on listen now revealing to you something listen the way he says it not that he's doing something that he's going to do or that he's promised amen and we live in a most impatient world nobody can wait on nothing it's harvest time amen notice the bible declares that the first thing that's harvested is not the wheat it's the tares and how are the terrors harvested by gathering together we're all the same brother come on join up with us let's sit around the table and gnosh on this a little while and let's try to figure out what he meant by what he said i don't need to know that i need to know the author amen and once you know the author you already know what he meant by what he said because you are in the author you don't have to guess it's not like a a drama that they put together for you to run down and spend 20 bucks on that's the popcorn it's only eight dollars to see the drama it's 20 for the popcorn catch it yes and you got to try to sit there and figure out hmm who's guilty who's the bad guy who's the good guy it's it look at the beginning it looks obvious huh oh there's the bad guy there's a good guy by the end of the thing you the good guy's the bad guy the bad guy's a good guy yeah all right what do you think they got that inspiration they called jesus the bad guy bells above right he ain't nothing but a devil a sorcerer where where is he getting this authority in this paul from he looked like the bad guy didn't he guess what at the end he's the good guy thank the lord do you realize that yeah man that was right but how is he doing it through his mystical body which is you this represented by the bride of jesus christ and you say well brother you just read me a scripture there in revelations 14 1 like unto the son of man i sure did did you realize what the prophet taught us with that statement one like unto the son of man is not the son of man let me clear it up for you he said that's his bride and you say well brother it looks like a man don't she yes amen because these two shall be one flesh let us make man in our image and after our likeness and he made that man both yeah amen male and female so it don't look like a woman because the bride is in him amen amen it looks like him amen that cloud that appeared in arizona in 1963 is one like unto the son of man amen amen he said well looks like the son of man to me it better still with me oh man i better hurry i'm watching the clock now you're separated people do you get that okay all right so i'm gonna put that aside because i still want to get to harvest still with me now i'm going to read one other thing to you out of harvest time because i began to think about the seed and then lo and behold if the lord didn't bring to my attention an article on the wheat now watch where the prophet goes i can read you all this but i'm just going to begin to to quote to you and you can go look it up but most of you know these things so the stalk of the plant was martin luther's dispensation right the just shelled by faith and then the tussle was john wesley's dispensation and it had to do with sanctification right and then the shock the third stage of the stock the carrier listen now the carrier of the life so nobody can dispute that it was not the life of god through jesus christ traveling through those stages or dispensations but it wasn't jesus christ it was the carrier of the life coming up through the stalk the torso and the shock is that right now listen to what brother branham says because there's one stage after the shock that most people are unfortunately deceived by right brother and that's the grain you say how could the grain be deceiving because people are mistaking the grain and the shock one for the other is that right now brother branham preached messages like three exoduses he's perfected in threes but he always said if god is gonna take you out of something he's got a place for you to go so therefore the life that traveled up those stages into the shuck which is the pentecostal age had to have a place to go it didn't stop there but brother branham said if you don't have a real good trained eye you see it matters who teaches you if you're not tight right you're gonna pull back a part of that plant you're gonna open up the pages of god's word and say that's it no that's the shock no but brother it looks just like the seed sure it does it would be so close now i realized there were light years people think past the pentecostal age but these denominational differences are still with us people still trying to decide do i have it do they have it does he have it does she have it do i got it and if you listen to the alternative yeah you ain't got it that's right there you go even if you think you got it right you ain't got it because this is only one life amen there's only one god amen right man is that right listen close now look this is out of harvest time again hurrying there must come a true seed amen there must come a true seed there has just got to be because he's coming for the bride without spot or wrinkle he's coming for it a word vindicated bride praise the lord a word vindicated bro because the prophet of god taught us that signs wonders and miracles should follow the believer but they're not an exact and true and pure indicator because janice and jabras can mimic can impersonate think about it moses said flies where did they come from they come from the words of god through moses they come into existence i don't care what science says they've been with us for trillions of years sure they have been in the mind of god all the time but the manifestation of them showed up in the days of moses so wouldn't it be simple wouldn't it be simple if moses if you knew moses had the creative power of god's word working through him and moses said flies you could run over here and say flies flies are going to show up oh yeah sure not because you said it because moses already said it all right so now you're becoming what they call a parrot an impersonator a mimic but because people don't realize there's a separation they think this guy's got it he said it too he said flies i see flies but do you realize where they came from they came from the voice of god through moses still with me okay he's coming forward a word vindicated right oh listen now she'll be such a little bitty group all right do i need to say that again come on now it'll be such a little bitty group how big was jesus church who was jesus god manifest in the flesh how many people did god manifest in the flesh have in his church oh thousands only when he was healing yeah only when he was feeding but when he got down to the word lest you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you oh we can't handle that i'm going to tell you what them 70 ministers did the ministerial association brother branham called them i'm going to tell you exactly what they did they did exactly like janice and jeffrey they heard jesus say unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the son of man you have no life in you and they say we can't take that it's a hard saying they go over here and preach it yeah right preaching it because they because see it's the words of life and that's the only place life comes from is god's word so they would have to preach a form of what was said by god in order to gather anything all right you're with me in order to gather anything right so you see brothers and sisters it's the very reason why i see there is the need for a separation but it's not you and me doing the separating it's not our churches or our pastors or the ministry it's the word of god and the reason it's the word of god right now is because it's harvest time and the word harvest comes from a root word i just looked it up in the dictionary i'm no rocket scientist to cut to shear to separate think about it that's what harvest is it's to separate the grain from the rest of the plant that carried the life but yet is going to die in the field and if the grain stays with it the grain is going to die with it so the grain has to be elevated that's why they call it a grain elevator it has to be elevated and that's why we're in rapture time because we've got to be elevated the grain has got to be plucked and then elevated who's doing the plucking if i take you to matthew 13 right now and i read to you out of your bible what the bible says about the reap the harvest and the reapers and you don't have to believe me but if you don't you better go look it up that's right you can go outside today and say that brother's office rocker well i challenge you to look it up matthew 13 verse 37 he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed now what did i just read to you brother brahm said there must come a true seed amen amen he that soweth the good seed is the son of man this ain't one life the son of man now this is the son of man sowing the seed now brother adam tells us in anointed ones at the end time he is not the son of man he's representing the son of man the field is the world what does the word world mean cosmos not the earth not the planet not the globe cosmos means the way things are the way things are done the field is the world the good seed oh i like this he says the truth seed's coming the good seed are the children of the kingdom do you realize you're the good seed if you're a child of the kingdom as brother daryl word would say that'd make a methodist shout now come on that's right are you the good seed or not you need to understand that you're this good seed if there's a question in your mind get rid of it amen separate from it see there's the separation coming here field is the world the good seat of the children of the kingdom but the tares you know the weeds are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sold them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world the harvest the separation is the end of the world can't you see it going on our nation is being separated beliefs and and that the way people see things is separating people i just read this morning a headline that says this nation is full of hatred think about it do you either believe it our way amen i will riot you don't see the real true genuine christians saying that but they understand you need to believe it our way because it's his way it's not my way it's not your way it's his way but we don't i don't carry a a banner i carry a life you say well i'm just one person and and i want to i want to get it out there i'll be careful i'll be careful speaking against the internet i know how some of you feel let me tell you folks something the internet these smartphones these tablets crypto all this cyber guess what it is it's technology that come from god's laboratory but not so that we could carry a gadget in our pocket to access it i'll just cut loose on you go ahead this technology that science has tapped into listen close now is lucifer's way of getting people to think that he is omnipresent think about it let it sink in i can get my phone out of that office right now and i can whatsapp somebody in africa facetime looks omnipresent looks like they're here and we're there but that's not the god we serve right now he's here right now right amen that's right he's there right now and he don't have to use the cellular waves he don't need a gadget his spirit does it don't you see how much further along we should be we should be so much further along than this mickey mouse internet ain't working today technology amen you need something from the lord you just begin to meditate on the lord guess what without a gadget he shows up amen i like it and he can show up at your house and at the same time show up at that house in that house that state that town that country right amen don't you understand brothers and sisters i'm not talking down technology we use automobiles they kill more people a gun wasn't invented to kill the first victim a rock was that's what cain used to kill abel with and they want us all to go back to rocks they'll still kill yeah you take the guns and the knives and the scissors and the forks out of the hands of the people and if they get sideways they'll find a rock what's my time limit brother i'm going to stop when my time's up i guess when you stand up and wave your arms i'm good you remember when i first come here i couldn't go 30 minutes and i've been preaching for years 30 minutes long oh brother you can't shut me down now because the word of god i found out i always knew it but i found out it's eternal there is no beginning and there is no end where are you going to stop where you're going to start you just kind of got to get on the trolley and ride right listen now we're still in matthew 13 the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world listen now and the reapers are the angels i want you to know there are many different kinds of angels so i looked up this word angel here in matthew 13 and you're going to be blown away what it means it's the very reason why the oxen have stumbled in the strong's concordance found under this use of the word angel it says to bring tidings a messenger especially an angel by implying a pastor i didn't make this up i looked it up and i was blown away when i said that i said that makes perfect sense to me because it is the local sovereignty of god in the local church using the ministry in that church to harvest you amen so that makes this post of duty a reaper but not a grim reaper we don't have a hoodie on we don't have a sickle or a scattered or whatever you want to call it in our hands we got life amen not death we're not reaping for death we're reaping for life and brothers and sisters whether you realize it or not everybody that passes away before the fulfillment of first thessalonians was supposed to yeah right amen amen brother wade and i talking and brother about the young couple that my son and daughter-in-law lived with just before they blew up in their house over there in ohio well i believe they're saved sure amen and it's up to god whether they're bright or not and i believe they're bright but guess what they were not supposed to be here i know that sounds cruel but they were not supposed to be here some of us may pass along and we were not supposed to be here to fulfill this scripture those which are alive and remain it's only gonna be an exact amount of people i mean to the letter we love those people and they're pulling for us do you realize that they without us cannot be made perfect and perfect is mature so it's going to require excuse me uh mature grain amen okay i've made my decision i'm going all the way [Laughter] but i ain't going all the way with this morning's message but i'm going all the way hey man okay that's one of my favorite little songs made my decision really going all the way thank you i'll finish the definition of harvest and i'll stop because i got this afternoon and he said i had more time listen to the definition from the dictionary i gave you where the the root of the word harvest came from to to cut to sheer to separate now these first two definitions in the dictionary and it was only three long sound familiar to us the time of the year when matured grain not immature not almost matured but matured grain fruit vegetables etc are ripped and gathered in not just raped and gathered in a season's yield of the same meaning the crop itself is also the harvest so the harvest is not just the reaping and the gathering it's also the gathered amen right the gathering in of a crop now this is where i got by the way this is this is what launched me into the tent vision amen i could see now that the tint vision has been you know um if i use the word disputed it would be accurate if i use the word uh various and different interpretations i would be accurate if i you understand and then of course and and being kind and nice there's all kinds of interpretations of it most of them require william branham to return all right okay i'm not separating from them folks some of them of our best friends grew up with them known them for 40-plus years not not impugning not disputing but i'm here to tell you this morning brothers and sisters that the revelation is lacking amen because faith is something he's going to do not something he's already done amen man faith is based upon a promise that is pulling you forward because it has not been fulfilled yet and it's and it's it's like a magnet drawing and drawing and drawing the believer i can see people are getting uncomfortable i better hurry listen to the third definition and right away when i read this i said that's it i know now that there's two ways that a vision is interpreted god sends a prophet a major prophet a gifted man that god's gonna talk through and he tells him give them yeah right my interpretation not the prophet gods give them right is that right what's the other one by it coming to pass but you still have to recognize the meaning of it in order to catch the coming to pass oh it's happening it's harvest time i'll tell you that right now the train's coming to pick us up telling you listen to this harvest the outcome or consequences the outcome or consequences of any effort or series of events as soon as i read that brother white i said that's the tent vision it's a series of events that take brother branham from the little brown children which he says in the present stage of my ministry was fulfilled in mexico city amen all the way to the little room amen yes you remember that i ain't got time to read it to you this afternoon i'll do that but i want to take you to the portion of the tint series that i had left off at home and that is that little room there's something very significant about that little room and the angel of the lord in closing told brother branham it's always scriptural always scriptural no matter what we think no matter what the prophets you know the prophet didn't understand many of those things i'll tell you he said i didn't understand those fish i didn't understand this i didn't understand that he said i didn't understand that little room he says that i'll read it to you but when the angel is beginning to give brother branham the interpretation of that little room he mentions a door amen and that's where we'll take you hey this afternoon please stand amen it's harvest time how does that song go i don't you all know i don't sing well i like to sing but i don't sing well this is the evening time it's later than you think oh yeah aren't we things [Music] oh yeah
