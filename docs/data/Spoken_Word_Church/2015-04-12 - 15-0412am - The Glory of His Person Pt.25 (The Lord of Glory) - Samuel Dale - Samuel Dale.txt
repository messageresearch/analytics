in Revelations one but we will pick up a couple of verses all right so it'd be Revelations one then we've got First Corinthians 2 and First Corinthians 15. so these all of these scriptures uh sister milka sent us a note she's not feeling too good today not able to be here hoping this afternoon but said her birthday is Friday and she wants everyone can come to her house Friday afternoon for a cake and ice creams that everyone welcome so you know if you can find out to go and all uh we wish her a happy birthday so that's one of those things that we all get you know we get those birthdays and they're they're part of it I'm in and now remember now this coming Saturday at the skillsville uh park there where we've been having our Easter times together we will be there the Lord willing starting about one o'clock I'll be eating at five so you are supposed to bring a dessert to that okay we got to get this right then on Sunday we will be eating together you know and it'll be a time

taken care of okay we got that going now remember that the Fourth of July meeting uh we will be having a cookout here starting about two o'clock in the afternoon be eating at five and we will have a service that night I've planned we was planning on having Bible study but uh I've just decided that we will go ahead and let brother Vernon preach to us on Saturday night and the two services on Sunday and he'll be here the Lord willing with us and doing that so remember now on that day only the night service will start at six o'clock that's on the 4th of July that way you'll be able to get home a little quicker or whatever if you need a place to stay that gives you a couple of months to get everything planned and all like that uh so you know do those things all right we're glad to have Mr Anthony up here with us today is the name Anthony am I right okay I get Anthony and Brian mixed up hey he's with us today and he's finished his high school and we're very proud of him and I pray that the Lord would help him he wanted to find him a good job so you just pray that that he'll he'll get a a good job and everything we're glad to have him with us today all right any other announcements I generally Miss Terence and Lisa is down having to stay with the grandbabies in Augusta and he tells everybody hi from there of course he can't say it real you know laughing here he's down there so he's having to watch us we can talk all we want to about him today okay all right we can do that all right that'll solve the problem okay anything else I generally forget something that we were just so pleased to be here in the house of the Lord all right father we thank you for your grace your love your understanding you for you because there would be no need of us being here if you wasn't here for ours and Lord and doing this and bringing us and we pray that you would just bless us Lord God each and every one remember all the sick among us father and you said in your word that you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destructions we love you we thank you we commit everything to you now and guide each and every one of us in Jesus name amen until we got Revelations we're going to try to pick up a little bit in our thought of what we hated to 25 Services ago all right so we'll go to Revelations 1 12. and I turn to see the voice that Spate when the end being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch with a golden girdle all right we're continuing our reading today to try to pick up a little more his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet likened to find Bryce as they burned in a furnace and his voice is the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a shark two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength now this is a picture of Christ throughout the word right that's where we're getting to now what we're talking on when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the lice I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and death and of death so if you'd like to go with us and we'll go over to Corinthians First Corinthians 2 we'll begin verse 1. and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God but I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling and my speech in my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men men but in the power of God albeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that come to know but we speak the wisdom of God listen in a mystery now watch him after a while when we read around I'm talking about a mystery but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world into our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory that will be our thought today all right we pick up in in First Corinthians 15 45. and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit how be it or nevertheless he would say that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual all right coming on down the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are heavenly now watch and as we have borne the image of the earth we we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of his word all right now we have spent quite a time and I hope that it too helps with our Wednesday we kind of change the things around and picked up some thoughts that I wanted to make sure you would understand me and you know what I'm saying to you and what I try to get across because we've been talking about and I said we won't get there as much in Revelations but it comes down describing uh the Lord Jesus Christ you know her like wool etc etc all right we will eventually get back in the Lord willing in the scriptures to pick that up but I'm wanting you to look at those things through the unveiling of God as he's being revealed through his word all right coming down through the word coming out to the time that we're living as a prophet would say it it's in Christ the mystery he said unveiling or unfolding itself down to this present hour now you know if it's not revealed to you and I mean that's the way I think I'm just I try to be this way if it's not revealed to you and I what's going on today Among Us you know I'm talking about all around the world now the bride of Christ then see we are not living in the present day tense we are still in the past or in some way trying to go into the future you know with it just you know because that's remember that's the problem is we're either back there trying thinking about what was or we're trying to figure out what will be and instead of missing or seeing what is now among us all right and see you can only see it unfold down to where you are you understand I mean that's as far as you can see you you can't see anymore the the rest of that future that has not come to pass yet that you may be able to see by visions you may be able to see by the word of the Lord come into the prophet he's already preached us like I told a man one time he was trying to tell me all about going up Beyond brother Branham I said well okay now I'm sorry but uh I want you to tell me what's going to take place after the future home and he looked at me well the prophet preached us to the Future home didn't he and told us about what would happen in the future home so if you're going to tell us something extra going over past dire and give us something and of course that wasn't exactly what he was talking about but you know that was just my way of getting a point across all right but you see unfolding down to the present hour now brother Branham saw the future he saw things but he didn't see that what's in the paper today that or the news today according to what was on their telephones that our president is going to declare that we can only go to church what twice a month well that's pretty good that's supposed to be on the news today now if anybody on the internet gets that and it ain't on there it ain't my fault I read it on the telephone or what they were saying okay all right but you know there is a law in the state of Georgia you can only travel 25 miles to church that would pretty well eradicate this church but that's been there for a long time back about 1974. all right but we're not caring about that we can handle things we will handle things and the way we're getting it now if it forces us we can just uh you can have your two weeks at home and I'll have my two weeks in the church oh okay we can go to internet and just get the whole month down that's all right I ain't worried about that see those things concern me nothing right because what is it what good is it is that going to put me in a Rapture cause I can't go to church oh it's here now the president is going to that's gonna be a war president this time well okay God puts in Kings and takes them out he puts in presidents and he takes them out so it's all right whatever what we need okay all right we're getting back to our point now we've covered it two or three messages to make sure and try to get it to you but see we can look at the Bible and we're supposed to see the condescending of God Our God coming down to reveal himself to mankind all right now in that doing we covered it to the bases of trying to get the point for you see that it's easy a lot of times to see the anointing and follow that throughout the Bible and as the prophet said unless you see Christ in every verse go back and read it again you missed something well that's that's good you know that's right and we believe it and we followed that through the Bible as showing the anointing that could come upon people and great things would take place but remember that anointing was not what saved those people from any of the judgments of those times you'd say well anointing was described all right but we we've supposed to be down to understanding now that the anointing can be upon you of the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit upon your spirit and you still be lost now that's one of the Mysteries of the end time of the anointed ones and it's not false anointed one do we we put that on there it's anointed ones that are false me the anointing is genuine all right it's the doing you say well why would God allow that to happen to try you and I to see whether we're going to be little babies you know are we going to be men and women of the Gospel to stand upon God's word and believe it are we going to be scared of who's going to be president me I I'm going to go ahead and make my statement I don't feel like you're Hillary I don't figure Hillary would even have said it like that like him saying if that's true that you're going to have it in two Services a month I don't believe she'd go that far all right yeah I don't know okay but listen following the Christ throughout the Bible we can see the great things taking place upon the people of the Bible and great things happening but can you follow the very person of God throughout the word to see him revealed in the word not just the anointing because the anointing never saved anybody now come on don't get me all grooved up in your mind and all I know about the Holy Ghost coming down and doing the things right but remember the anointing won't save you it takes the person of Jesus Christ to give you eternal life it's not just an anointing that won't work all right then see we look at that all right and see how that the coming of the Lord is the revealing of his word all right that's as good a definition of any to put to it because that'll fit the entire Bible and anything you could think of that would go with it that your own personal points but it's still got to come back to the revealing of the word of God all right now in that then as we can speak here of it and look at the word can we see God in his word or just read about the Christ now as I told you um anybody can read the Bible and if they pick up one thought of that's the Christ they can make a great discourse of our speech or you know a message about the Christ throughout the Bible but how many people have you ever heard talk about the person of God being revealed throughout the word the Fourth Man In The Fire wasn't an anointing me that was a person amen all right and see him come down through there as the one that would be in all of those Prophets and live their lives out to show things and like I was saying to you the anointing on on Elisha or Elijah there you know with the she bar that anointing could be that right around and said that wasn't of God that was the power of the Prophet going with the anointing all right but see if it would have been the real God of the word they would have been sparing the children and I'm rough I know but it would have been destroying the parents is the ones that already been ate up by the virus all right because they were the one that caused the children to say what to say it all right and see they were the one that deserved it but now we you know okay all right but now we read here in in Corinthians that it said had they known who this was they would have not killed the Lord of Glory had they known who that was would they have killed him and they killed him for saying exactly what the word saying and they were the ones that were supposed to know the word to the letter of what it said like I was saying the other day about it see when when Paul took that Old Testament Scrolls to the backside of the desert he already knew about the Messiah that was promised he already knew that a child would be born he already knew those great things but he could not see that this was Jesus Christ that was speaking to him was that God of the Old Testament living right there in front of him and I asked you and I the questions do we see that we can talk about seeing as I say and keep saying that we can see the Christ in the word and we can talk about that and we can see the anointings and the great things that happened but could we see what I was trying to bring out that Jesus was the very manifestation of the love of God because he was God all right see he was back there revealing himself through those prophets as they were building the body me that John would finally come to introduce the god of the word right who was it being made known back there read Christ The Mystery of God revealed God had a plan and a purpose the anointing don't let him to be known as healer and savior see you I know in your mind if you had never heard that that clicks in the wrong way but you you see it's not the anointing that saves you it's not the anointing that healed you if it is why did he get beat why does it say you know by Stripes we're healed why did he have to die on the cross if it was just an anointing we see there was a whole lot more taking place back there and we are supposed to be watching that person of the word as he reveals himself down through the Bible and coming down to the ages coming down to this end time Prophet that would bring us the entire word of God but then there's got to be a group of people it's got to be that word that's right all right that's our choice okay see he was The Lord Of Glory he wasn't just a man he was the very God of Eternity revealed in flesh all right but can you follow that the prophet even used it calls him the Lord Of Glory on the revelation of Jesus Christ all right we'll buy some of these because we've got so many number two they'll pick it up on spiritual adoption and let's see who this was that we're talking about because he was The Lord Of Glory made manifest so he's the Lord Jesus Christ the god of Glory made manifest that's what he's saying on the revelation of Jesus Christ look what he says here on the spiritual adoption and the father today has put the right kind of a tutor over his sons you and I I selected none other than the very heart and soul of the Lord Jesus to raise us in the admonition of God the very heart and soul of almighty God In You and I by a new birth not just an anointing I know that I require that you think about what you're saying but why don't you want to think about it I mean your life is at stake hey folks we getting older whether you realize it or not go home and look in the mirror if something don't happen pretty quick we're going to all be down at the funeral home or the nursing home first see we've had 40 something years we've been going around horrible right you see waiting for it to be made known but the very heart and soul of the Lord Jesus Christ comes and lives in you and I in the new birth well I don't I I don't understand how it can be heart and soul oh heart here Souls here see you're still back in the thoughts of what your mind is trying to tell you instead of looking at it correctly the heart of anything is the center of anything that's the middle of it it's not a your thumping gizzard is not your soul see all right but now thinking about it we've covered in quite Lance now that the Genesis 1 26 man was made in the image of God all right now and then we've just touched a little because we knew we would come into this eventually that see as we were made in the image of God then God comes into the image of man all right now may I make a statement let you think on it we talk about image as being that that's not another person we talk about that Genesis 1 26 man is is the manifestation of God you know because it is the eternal life all right that was what put in Adam and Eve but we had to bypass all of that and come down to flesh to be tempted all right but there was one who came into the world that was the very heart the soul the mind the spirit the all in all almighty God himself that's why I spent so much time trying to get our thoughts away from God it's just a spirit all right you may have got tired of hearing that but one of these days you know what it'll down on you and God can reveal it to you that that he's not just a spirit that he's real all right Paul said if needful if I say it two or three times all right I may say it 25. so forgive me but just think about it what do you think about almighty God how real is your god then you see why who would be concerned about a president making a documentary statement or who doing what why would you be concerned about it if you're thinking about the God of Glory you mean the one down through all of the Bible that protected those people and done all the great things under the anointing we talk about and you think it's going to come in the end time and going to finish up in the bases that would well we just sat around waiting on a bus to pull up don't take off you mean that's what you think will it be the finish of the entire Bible when even the great things that that goes to the Jews and the things hereafter the prophet said and taught us we were the center of the Bible not to just say the Jews but the bride of Christ he said when she realizes who she is and what she's here for Satan will be powerless all right you say are you looking forward to that no no I'm looking at it excuse me I don't like to look forward I look I like to look at things all right and see it here yeah but I don't see no open your eyes we were talking yesterday about things that God has done Among Us and you'd say well no that was doctors they operate on they done this that and the other woohoo give them the ability to do that where did the medicine you take come from now sure we know there's bad stuff right but there's also a lot of good stuff right right go home through all your pills out you become like we used to be you know and I didn't have it but I don't know many of you did you take your cigarettes and boy you throw them out the window of the car the next day you're riding down the road looking to see find them laying out there well go sling your pills out a couple of days later you're gonna be hunting a doctor up to write you another one you know so why not just be realistic and just take it like it is and not worry about it and say God is here with us because without it where would we be all right yeah but I want to see this I want you'll never see it that way it was never in the Bible that people wanted to see something that took place it always took place and then they found out later it done took place right you think the children of Israel even out of Egypt thought Moses was to deliver when he run up against a wall of water and couldn't get across he didn't think too much about that being Victorious they just wanted to go back become slaves all right okay get off of it but listen now bear with the thought and get it correctly of what I'm saying okay we were made in the image of God in a spiritual being the flesh man was made in the image of the animal or the form or the ways of the animal and time but then God came down and was made in our image right as a man amen all right now do we hold it being in the image of God I hope after all that I've said coming down to a point that this Genesis 1 26 and 27 man was eternal life and that if we have that eternal life then it has been made manifest in our hearts and our soul the very being of God Living In You and I are you still just some anointing uh I like what Brother Gary Atkins said one day he said brother Dale if I'm an anointed one I'm I'm not too much anointed you know that's that was his point I hope he's watching in he'll laugh at that all right but you see we think that we're only speaking of the image of God as being that spiritual man but if man is made of the highest form of animals which you then he would be higher than anything would it not be that God would look like us right so no that's that's hard for you to swallow isn't it well what do you look like well it was just a spirit now according to the prophet that's not true but you know what prophet could say that 25 times it still ain't gonna get through that brain of yours until the Holy Ghost reveals it I know that all right well see wouldn't it be then that God was a fully intending to create man and that the man that he would create that he could fellowship with that man was he in the garden just a theophany body and walking around or was that almighty God walking around because either way you put it it's going to turn out to be the same thing so you might as well admit it all right because he was not a glob talking to Adam and Eve they brought around and said he'd come down in the cool of the day and put him to sleep and lay him down and saying children have you had a good time today well it was just anointing floating in the garden and they just knew it was oh yeah yeah see you're not getting the reality of a living God that we would be greater than he is come on all right but you see then would it not be his plan and purpose even if there was not a fall he had already started with two people well then what image would God be that's yes but it's only in the spiritual image that we are well I I don't think my guard looked like a monkey I don't think he'll look like a monkey when we get there because according to the Bible I get dirty I know it but according to the Bible the Bible said we'll have a body what like unto his glorious body well we're gonna go back looking like monkeys crawling around with our Knuckles on the ground you say you silly no ain't silly telling the truth what do you think me he brought man into the where he was and I know that he was brought into the image of man yeah the form of man change in other words brought from the supernatural down through is we would talk about the theophany the the spiritual man and then on down into being human flesh and sure we'll get to it a little while that flesh and Melchizedek was not able to die for you there was a reason for that because he had to be a kinsman redeemer in that flesh of Mount chattered it was just a flesh-spoken in spoken out it wouldn't you can't have him to die for you but you better think too that as a baby he couldn't die for you you better think as a teenager that he was confounding the why Scholars but yet he couldn't die at that position you better think about it 33 years at 30 years of age when he become Anointed with that Holy Spirit on the River Jordan that at that time he couldn't die for you and I because the word had not been fulfilled okay there's a lot of scriptures there that we need to think about instead of taking our own ideas but it's so hard for the human mind to I guess I know this is what I've been accused of they say brother Dale you're making him too human I'm not making him human the Bible and the prophets wasn't doing it I'm just reading what he says you accuse me now would you say but but but but but but brother they'll leave him God I have no problem with it right because when this thing is over and finished I've told you what I believe I believe when we get dire we'll see Jesus we won't see a little halo over here for the father and a little spot over here for the Holy Ghost because that wasn't what Jesus said he said if you've seen me you've seen the pillar of fire you've seen the anointing you've seen the father in that Bible all right but see it requires you to think out of what his old saying of course what is that thing the big old words are you you got to think out of the box I never did figure that out because I never got in the Box I didn't know what it was but it means to get away simply from what you used to or what you've been taught you know but listen if God is real why would we not think of him as being in our form look it like this well that would only end Jesus okay we solve that with a scripture we get there we have a body like in his glorious body so that's supposed to be Jesus right but you see it's hard for us to think about that that man that walked the shores of Galilee was none other than the very heart and soul of the Lord Jesus to raise us in the admiration of God that's supposed to be your new birth your tutor he just got through explaining the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the person of Jesus Christ all right what are we then what are we and then what is he we'll get to it maybe this afternoon or it won't be then um maybe next Sunday what is man the dark mindful of him and the son of man that's how visit is him all right now let's go on down to number three brothers and just read these and I'll go as far as I can go if I don't worry about it I'll stop and start over but he's talking about the baptism if you remember this is where it's at uh that don't mean that you're saved not by our long ways look at here you're a Trion being you are inside this little fella here is the soul the next is the spirit the next is the body now you got five senses in this body to contact your Earthly home they don't contact the rest of it you got five senses of the spirit here love conscious and so forth of that but in here is where you live that's what you are all right a try on being a you're a Trion being Body Spirit and soul all right now we say this here because to keep people from uh running off on what they're doing remember in the early Ministry brother Branham was explaining and he basically covered body Soul and Spirit and then on the life's part that he comes into the 63 4-5 especially the opening of the seals he was explaining the body the spirit and the soul but never did he change the senses of that position he always gave the first position five senses he takes feel smell in here he always gave the second Rim whether he called it Soul or called it Spirit he made that as to be Memory conscious affections Etc and the center part was one sense either Faith or doubt all right that ties together the entire message to her that someone will not he don't know what he's talking about he said Body Spirit and so brother Brown says Body Soul and Spirit oh just wonderful but that don't impress me it don't impress me how beautiful words you can use what impresses me is what you can bring that I can let God reveal that to me all right well see you're a Trion being Body Spirit and soul all right and be in that Triune being look what he says about it go ahead number four questions and answers 1960 one please explain the difference between spirit and soul well that's a hard one but the first thing you're a Trion being just like Father Son and Holy Ghost Father Son and Holy Ghost is three titles going to one person which is Jesus Christ and your soul body and spirit but it takes those three to make you with just one of them you're not you it takes the tree to make you now we're going to read one in a minute where he says it takes a three to make God because see that's where we're not Oneness as Jesus only all right that Jesus was the last manifestation of God you know and one like your finger and we're not Trinity of three persons but we've got to keep it to the point that he is a Triune being right or you can't tie together the Bible me you'll be getting things all messed up all right but look it takes no Street to make you with just one of them you're not you it takes three to make you Body Spirit Soul everyone you're going to say it and put it on it takes that to make you all right now that'd be a good high school lesson on what is the word for it biology but it takes a revelation now look what he brings out we're going down into God's go to number five God's covenant with Abraham roller donut you read all of it before and after and don't worry about it he talks about the senses to contact the home so he says fail those are to contact the early home but none of those are to contact God he's a a man is a man is a makeup of a Triune being soul body and spirit a trinity in a man just like God was a trinity in a man right now he's not explaining Trinity right right he's explaining what he is Father Son and Holy Ghost Body Spirit soul takes that to make you it takes Father Son and Holy Ghost to make one true and living God but that's not a trinity right so keep that in line now go to the next one number six questions and answers in 54. see the Bible said he wept the lady you know was proving that he was just a man and that proves proves he could weep I said sure that was the son that was weeping he was a God man he was a Triune being just like I am you are we're soul body and spirit he was Father Son and Holy Ghost and the deity of God that's who he was he was the deity of God all right now just like I am he was a Trion being just like I'm a drone being is that enough for you to believe that he was dwelling on Earth as the Bible says God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself is that enough for you to follow we have plenty more don't worry about it but is that enough for you to follow that the Bible according to the scriptures Hebrews 10 5 a body thou has prepared me that body was provided by the form of Mary receiving the seeds you know the egg and the sperm to produce the baby and had nothing to do with it herself other than an incubator but it brought a body all right now according to these latest doctrines it's out now that Jesus wouldn't God to the River Jordan then they're saying that when he was born to have to be saying it then when he was born he just got a a spirit and a soul of a man Hey Brother Gary you didn't hear me talking about you want to go like I'm walking in yeah yeah he can go back and listen to what I'd say about him I'll do him like we used to do I don't know how many of you remember Bill Cunningham but he was a mess and all you had to say to him was that well I got something but I'm going to tell you now I'll tell you later and he'd bug you to death about what you'd said every time you're telling me don't do me that away that's the way we'll do you that way okay but now think about it if he's a Trion being just like I'm a throne being is there any problem to think about God it's Body Spirit and soul why would we want to think any other way you know the body came by creation we know that when it came from the Virgin Mary all right well why can't we think that the spirit that came in him is the spirit of almighty God that anointing that anointed all of those people back through the Old Testament the time why not and when I think that the soul is the very not just the soul of God but it's the very Soul God himself because Soul means person and being and what you are that was God manifested in flesh but see the River Jordan people said he was just a man so that would mean he's got a body from God and a spirit from God and a soul from God and then all at once he got anointed and he become God then God took anointing back off only become a man and he died within that body and spirit and soul and that didn't wouldn't do you no good come on but what about do we really believe it do we believe that he would say one day into thy hand I commend my spirit would we believe that he would say as we'll get on further in the message my soul is troubled that he could speak about a soul the body and a spirit of himself but you're just making him too real I wish I could make him so real until you could see him because one way or the other one day we will see him either sitting on a throne to judge us to send us to hell for rejecting the word or either we will be standing there as his bride with him one way or the other is going to be what about this statement that he would make no to number seven this is taken from Jesus Christ the same yesterday day and forever reasons 61. once now he is alive today soul body and spirit he is alive okay who was that that raised we talk about last weekend look what he says he is alive today soul body and spirit he's alive that's the theme of our conventions always is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever then do you believe that he was almighty God that walked on the shore to Galilee or a second person or a or a um demon god which means another God in another form because if you're saying that he wasn't god Till The River Jordan then you're making him a demon god you're making him another God somewhere is this called according to my Bible it says that God was talking to people there are 13 years of age that a prophet would say what about your God with no teeth what you see but those people have the anointings with them and their soul and the people that are they're dwelling with have they go by the anointings and that's what carries them and it guides them well and then you've watched it throughout the years that you've been around the message you've seen them they run good for a while and boy everything's good you know all at once they just start dwindling down you know but then there's another guy comes up and they just well they grab on that bandwagon and they're they're just going with it well I just never have found no bandwagon yet you know I just keep on going like I am but can you believe what he would say about it in spirit he's alive well where's his body according to the Bible it's sitting on the throne words is Spirit according to the Bible it's here to lead and guide everyone else just like it was in the Old Testament where is his soul according to the Bible and the prophet is supposed to be hearing You and I by the new birth but it's always been all in my life that God is The Spirit Well then grandma was okay but you remember brother Brown was saying Mama might have believed it but we're in a different day now you know we appreciate what Mom and Grandma and them believed but if they didn't believe the truth it's not the truth they don't make it the truth because Grandma believes it of course we're all little kids we always believed that didn't we all grandma was the best cooks he was the best man she was doing with life and talking the other day going down the road my mother dipped snuff and and man I said little kids you know we'd be out in the field picking cotton he got stung by uh packs or they call them pack saddles or something and the man them things would kill you you're picking your cotton they just get on your hand boy you're this thing you would go running to Mama mama had that stuff and you stepping on that thing and you went on about your day cause it quit hurting well it had some good sides to it okay but that's all right I'm not encouraging dipping snuff but I I am like nanny said she's she's explaining that let me put it in my words what's the difference in keeping an alavor leaf and which one is it the leaf and you can rub on what's there keep it out of keeping your box of stuff sitting up in the cabinet it quit hurting I Ain't Gonna Get No Stuff that's okay forget it but listen folks what do you believe about God gets you to kind of shook where you want look what he says in number eight they were on our notes where it's taken from and north at not which is 1965. he's coming down explaining the three rings you know what you're drawing that's God God in a Trinity is One and without a trinity he's not God now here's a man that doesn't believe in a trinity and said the word turn ing look what he's explaining all right all right he can't be manifested any other way father son holy ghost He that's the three attributes of God all the rest of them is healer and savior and deliver and Etc it's all in that three attributes but without any of those after you take away one of them he's not complete and neither can you be manifested without being the Trinity person that you are that's Body Spirit and soul without either one of them you're not complete see you don't have a soul you'd be nothing you didn't have a excuse me you didn't have a soul you'd be nothing you didn't have a spirit you would be nothing you didn't have a body you just be a spirit not a body so God is complete in the triunity of a being all right not try Unity of beings not three beings one being manifested in the middle of life but one being in a triunity father son the Holy Ghost is one true manifested God all right but we understand the godhead brother Dale we need to do oh yeah we need to get these deep things yeah it's okay no problems look what he goes on to say in number nine which is works his faith expressed 1965. now remember you're in a shackle of three but you're one person like Father Son and Holy Ghost cycle of tree but one person three attributes are the same God fatherhood three officers like fatherhood sonship and Holy Ghost and you are Body Spirit and soul now the outside of the body has five thousands unconscious of me he goes down to explain to where you live right all right but see you're one person he's one person with many many manifestations one person look what he says on the unveiling of God number 10. got all the fullness all the godhead bodily was in this person Jesus Christ he was God and God Alone not a third person or a second person or a first person but the person veiled in human flesh do you understand it before we make a few more readings of things that were said and we've used them before but do you understand what I'm saying to God to reveal it to you but you understand what I'm saying that as a human being we are Body Spirit and soul it takes that to make a human being all right without either one of them we would be missing a part and it wouldn't work all right without father-son and Holy Ghost he cannot be the true God that's why we're not a trinity and why we're not a one let's see but we hold to that it ain't like the Bible says you know uh baptized in the name of the father another son the Holy Ghost then Peter says in the name of Jesus Christ and we say I've heard people in this message saying you know way back years ago we take Acts 2 38 for our baptism they take Matthew 28 19. no way that's wrong if they took Matthew 28 19 to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because father-son Holy Ghost has no names you can't be baptized that away it's got to be the Lord Jesus Christ right all right so now if we believe that we as human Mortals are a triome being Body Spirit and soul why can't we believe God would be in a Triumph being of Body Spirit and soul because you see church with a you know like I said whether you believe it or not that's up to you but that's the only way I can see one God and see it correctly but either you see you're going to the Oneness side or you're going to go to the Trinity side I mean and the god in three persons Blessed Trinity is not the middle now come on that's over on the Trinity side right it's not you say well boy we got the middle right because we got God's Reaper there's no such thing as God in three persons person is personality personality is individual individual is a person you're right back into the trinitarian concept but do you see when that baby was born the Bible said born this city born this day in the city of David is a savior okay that deals with the body making the price but you got to get to the soul to be in the Savior part but body making the price born this day in the city today is a savior which is Christ the lord as we read do you think they would have killed him had they known that he was The Lord Of Glory no but he had to die that a way to release the life because within him was that now anointings can come on people and it could come on people while he was here right right it did cough us it prophesied that Jesus would have to die for the sins or one without to die for the sins of the people what do you see what one true and living God then would be body a man bruh spirit and I'll be glad to find this one before he Brethren said his very Spirits 100 times and divers matter that anointed those Prophets but you ought to be able to believe that because what would it be if it's just a mortal Spirit then you have no God and you can't say that God came himself he'd be sending somebody else I thought that's what we believed so then that man that walks ashore's real Galilee and body he was a man yeah but a special creation not like any other man but a special creation but in the image or form of looking like the rest of the creation all right don't you believe that that would have been the body that he would have been in had they not been a fall are you going to leave it that we're just supposed to be something out here and we're having a good time but he's still floating around lonely I don't think that way all right but think about it embody a human being a man as we call it we're referring to the 16 elements called the flesh but in spirit that was the spirit and Sunday times and diverse manner to speak to those prophets back there Indian Soul he was the very being of almighty God you got you one God correct and you got it to where he could say I and my father are one but then he could turn around and said if you've seen me you've seen the father because it's one a father a human a being you know many titles but how many people am I we'll see maybe we're to consider the fact of thinking about that sure we started off this situation by being in His image but then what would that mean he looked like then we're not in His image because his image wound up being God in human flesh I thought that was what the new birth was supposed to bring God living in you and I the only problem we have to okay so then let's get this a few of them and look what he says in the message I am the resurrection he spread around said in flesh he was human but his spirit but he but is his Spirit he was God oh now you think I might have read that wrong because it's not it is his Spirit he probably was meaning in his Spirit but that's up to him in flesh he was human but in his Spirit he was God I said he cried that was a man crying that was a man when he was crying going down the Lazarus gray but when he stood there and straightened that little frame up and said Lazarus come forth and a man that's been dead four days come to life again that was no more than a man that was God speaking truth or Hallelujah God was in his son that was God speaking through mortal flesh corruption knew its Master Okay number 12 looking for Jesus 54. he was a human he was a human as far as being flesh he was a human in spirit he was God but as flesh he was the son of God you believe that don't you because you're a Christian 13. The Darkest Hour Jesus came 56. 55. see pulled from him talking about the woman you know the weakness Verger through that human body of his because he was just a man born of a woman but his father was God but in his body he was a man in his spirit he was God all right do we believe that no there was a spirit up yonder somewhere we'll get down to it eventually where we're talking about the Kinsmen Redeemer no all right calling Jesus on the scene remember in flesh he was just a man but in spirit he was God but a man in flesh therefore his body was a human being that was subject to Temptations subject to sicknesses just the same as ours all right calling Jesus on the scene 63. she's saying how could he be God and a man see there is the mystery look see in body he was a man in spirit he was God he called it a mystery you know I always thought a mystery had to be revealed if not it's still a mystery God keeps him keeps his word 57. yeah he's talking about the blood and the Fulfillment of the word he said I believe in body he was a man I believe in his soul he was God he was God's manifestation here on Earth God in Christ reconciling the world to himself I believe that he was not just a mere man neither was he a prophet he was God Emmanuel I believe with all of my heart that be in truth I can't prove that truth because if I could then it wouldn't be of faith God you've got to believe it right when Christ died he committed his Spirit taken from the thy house number 19 if they catch up with me reading when Christ died he committed his Spirit to God before he left the the cross he said into thy hands I commend my spirit and the Bible said his soul went to hell and preached that's his conscience and what he was to the spirits was in prison and his body went to the Grave he said after three days the barricade was taken away because the scripture said his Spirit went to the soul and soul went to the body and he rose he didn't go for something else to try to find it I thought we believed it brought around and said your Resurrection is were I thought he said it was in US the message every present water from The Rock he was here on Earth when he died his soul descended into hell and preached the spirits that were in prison the souls in prison they repented not in long-suffering of the days of Noah his body went into the grave but before he died he commended his Spirit into the hands of God his Spirit went to God his soul went to hell and his body went to the grave and Jesus was barred out from Resurrection until the scripture could be fulfilled he could not come back because he had to stay in the grave for three days a night but when the scripture were all full authentic fulfilled this bar was taken away his Spirit descended to his soul his soul to his body and he rose again all right thank God right Jesus Christ the same yesterday today in Forever 61. when Jesus died at Calvary we know that his soul went to hell his body went to the Grave his Spirit went to God and Calvary said unto thy hands I come in my spirit and his Spirit went to God the Father into his hands the Bible said his soul he he went to hell and preached to the to the ones was in prison that repented not in the long-suffering of the days of Noah going down in entombment 57. here he goes where did he leave when he left the Bible said he ascended he went and preached to the spirit Souls that were in prison that repented not in a long suffering in the days of Noah he sold his Spirit his theophany of his own being went down let's follow him he said all right God's provided way of approach to Fellowship he said did you know God lived in a three-room house and we'll take up right here this evening did you know God lived in a three-room house you know that everything I've got them if you want to quote everything you go back Run free room just run um three-room house or three room into your computer and watch what he comes up with you know that even in the Old Testaments he'd had to be out of court in a court holy holy and you can't explain it without it being a revelation but there's only two veils Don't Preach revealed folks you get it wrong there's two veils outer Court one Veil inner Court innovail holy of holies there's only two values you say well you got to get on no you you get to three and what you do look what did you know that God lived in a three-room house you live in a three-room house you dwell in three room house God dwelt in Christ soul body and spirit oh you live soul body and spirit you live in a house of your own here on Earth you remember how he was explaining that you can have 14 bedrooms but you only got three rooms in your house you can have a hundred rooms but you only got three rooms you got a living room but what is it it's parlor and in the bedroom all right but said do you know that God lived in a prayer room now look what he says that when we get to and when we die taken from the ever-present water from The Rock our souls will go under the altar of God where I was privileged to see a few mornings ago as you know in division where the Bible speaks of our spirits will go to God who give it and our bodies will return to the dust of the Earth but someday when the scripture is fulfilled our spirit will be released from God will pick up the soul and the soul to the body and the power that raises us up is right in us now we're in Heavenly places look at the next perfect strength by Perfect weakness and make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability we've got to make a complete surrender to come to God you've got to surrender to him both body soul body and spirit everything that you are has to be surrendered to God Body Spirit and soul that's where trouble's at we said well my soul is born again but what about our spirit and our body a lot more could be said right but what do you believe about God well he just sent somebody down and let them go do these things and yeah according to the prophet he came himself all right then why don't we think of him being body spirit and soul and that one of these days we'll see him like that foreign remember we're supposed to have been in the message long enough to learn a few things I know about your theophanese once you see in the times right but you know brother random saw Jesus am I correct and you know what he said about that Jesus he said as far as looking he looks the most like the Hoffman's head of Christ than anything he'd ever seen you ever seen some of the pictures of Jesus ugliest looking warped Up Mud you've ever seen my brother random said the Jesus he saw that Hoffman's head of Christ was the closest well now do you think he saw theophany okay but who'd it look like brother random was beyond the curtain of time he might not have recognized those people immediately upon who they were in relation but once he was told who they were he recognized oh he even recognized his dog he even recognized his horse he recognized his wife it'll look like when we get out of here that's why the board is downstairs with the people that are about 18 20 years of age or somewhere the closest we can get to that that has passed on you know probably as much as I knew brother Tatum my sister Tatum I'd probably recognize him but still might have a little trouble in a young age maybe some of you saw him in young age and you'd recognize them quicker not one of those pictures I came up with that idea for about 20 years ago 30 years ago to put everybody you know what if you die I'll put your picture up there you know if I die I hope you put mine because there ain't no pictures of me the closest picture you'll find to me is me standing out in the yard hanging diapers up on a clothesline in about 20 years of age and no shirt on well I had a physique man because my waist was about 31 and it never got no bigger the higher you went so I was a bean Pole right but you see I believe in the resurrection we're going to see those people that know who they are they're not going to have to introduce themselves that was just a thought that came to my mind I want to be able to see them oh brother Jimmy Gibson we put his picture down there and we have seen him in his life but when he's about 18 20 years old he nice looking young guy but you see what I'm talking about do you see what I believe I believe that when Jesus walked on this Earth that that body was a creation by the word Hebrews 10 5. that spirit that was within him that's why may I quote wrote around him and said he said that's why he knew things it was the spirit that was within him that was back there in the Old Testament speaking through those Prophets but then there was a being that mankind had missed the mystery of what he would be and they killed him can we do the same today do you realize if we don't accept the truth of God in his ways that we are crucifying him again so let me believe it thank God enough sense Lord just letting me believe it see that way then I ain't tied together with every scripture in the Bible I don't have to deny anything I don't have to say he was wrong here and right over here I can take a whole message in the Bible and it'll tie together never had no problems with it well I just don't see it the way you see it okay just pray for me all right ain't trying to make nobody believe anything come on brother I'm trying to make nobody believe anything you take away people's three more ages three more agency when you try to make them believe it the only thing I've ever told you about anything I said you can come here and believe what you want to but just don't try to bring it among the people then you'll get me to order I'll say something about it because I'm the pastor sorry you know I don't want to do that but I have to be that I'll tell you what I believe and I'll tell you why I don't believe those things but you tell me why you don't believe them that's all I ask you to do you come up here I'll let women all you have this evening and sister if you can explain God in some other better way than Body Spirit and soul to see him as a mortal being upon the Earth two thousand years ago and to see that one day we will meet him in the air and it'll be Body Spirit and soul of almighty God because that's who is God and that's not trinitarianism but neither is it Oneness it's the truth of the word of God let's Stand Together think about it with transition s two things dreamers when he's revealing something to you just raise your hands and say thank you Lord you just revealed something to me thank you thank you for my family my husband my wife the kids in many ways but we place the blood of Jesus Christ we my soul Glory and crackers saying that to one another if you leave and time is
