========================================

douglas don't we in the light of your glory pour out your power and love holy holy holy holy holy holy i want to see amen ain't that your purpose amen we want to see jesus he says blessed are the pure in heart they shall see god amen that's right amen that's our purpose here we'll greet you all in the name our lord and savior jesus christ sure is good to be back again and sure love and appreciate each and every one of you you pray for us that the lord will have his way today and that he'll minister to us i i have no ability within myself to do anything but the only thing i have a little like broadband said we just have a little gift that's to get out of his way amen amen we sure appreciate you sending greetings from brother tim he sends his love and appreciation each and every one of you and uh we're just expecting god to do something for us today amen today is a new day amen amen we have needs and god knows every need you have here he's more than able to supply him according to his riches in glory you only get what you expect amen to remember the book of ephesians chapter four i want to read verses one through 13. when you get it say amen amen amen aren't you thankful for the word amen david said i've heard thy word in my heart that i've sinned not against you he was already testifying of the holy spirit amen he says i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherein your call with all lowliness and meekness with long suffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there is one body one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ i'm just going to stop right there and we'll finish it later let's pray father what more can we say but thank you father amen father your grace has been more than sufficient for us lord father we're so thankful now lord we ask lord jesus that you'd come now the divine interpreter of the word that you would come and minister to our hearts lord would you set me aside lord would you get me out of your way lord i give myself completely to you for your honor and for your glory that you might speak to your children father we have one purpose and that's to see you glorified to see you magnified to see you lifted up father and for lord this service here today that we would leave a better christian lord and father there's only one way we'll ever do that is that's when you speak lord father because man can speak nothing to better us but lord you speak everything and it makes us for better than persons and father better walk of life father you're the one that does it all father so we surrender ourselves to you that you may be glorified for we ask it in jesus christ's name amen and amen you may be seated amen i like the way paul starts here he said out there for the prisoner of the lord you know you're a prisoner yes one way or another you're either gonna be a prisoner of the devil or you're going to be a prisoner for christ i mean we have and i'm glad god put us on free mortal agency that we have a choice in this he said we're no longer under bondage of sin right but we've been set free i'm thankful for that verse 4 said there is one body he said and one spirit even as you're called in one hope he said that one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all through all and in you all right he's showing the oneness here for us he said in verse 13 says till we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the statue of the fullness of christ i want to talk about this afternoon a little bit just for a few moments of your time spiritual harmony you know paul is talking about their hat that uh there's a christian here he has an atmosphere that he can create you know and god has you know god gets us to the place of where we have to have an atmosphere created for him to come in and to be one with us see jesus come and had a purpose in his life that he would bring god and man back together come on brother there had to be an atmosphere created there had to be one that would die and give his life for me and you that mean you could come into this spiritual harmony this relationship with christ because we were sold under sin we were sold out we were under a shotgun wedding and god who's so rich in mercy said i'm going to come down and i'm going to make a way back where we can come together in spiritual harmony and live in oneness with him and his word that's what he's desiring of us he's telling us here you know the first the most direct destructive uh part is when sin comes in that's what brought this force that separated god in man that bring this separation right every time that's what brings separation is sin come on for the bible said we have all sinned and come short of the glory so it had to take a redeemer to come and bring us back to this place one that was sinless without sin to bring us to the place where we're at today i'm so thankful that god sent us a message that could bring us back to the oneness of the word the truth not depending upon any man or any idea or any any intellectualism but we're depending upon the word is bringing us back to this maturity the full word first of all to have unity requires truth amen that's one thing we'll never come together under unity except truth hallelujah if it ain't the truth there's no way we can unite to anything except the truth the bride can has no doubt or no desire to unite to anything but truth because he said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free and who the son is set free is free indeed see jesus whole purpose here in saint john 10 30 he said i and my father are one amen see that's what he's desired for us to be is to be one with him amen one with his word he said sanctify them through thy word that word is truth and this message was the only thing that could bring us to a place of a true sanctification that we could become one with the word that would bring a rapture to get us in a position to receive a rapture oh my what a mighty god amen we got something to be excited about we got more than just fables we got the truth and the truth has made us free real true faith is men's weakness leaning on god's strength that's what dale moody said he said real faith is men's weakness leaning on god's strength we have to come to a place to realize that we are leaning on his strength and him alone he is our strength paul said when i am weak then he's strong it's not about a certain personality it's not about a man it's about god we're here for one purpose that christ may be lifted up spirit means or refers to as the holy spirit unity without the holy ghost you cannot understand the thing of god because we see nicodemus come and he asked him these questions and he said you you can't even understand you being a teacher and you can't even understand these things see it took of earth it took a born-again experience to be able to understand the word of god not this head it's a spirit it's a divine revelation that god has to give us man i'm thankful for the grace of god ain't you when a person accepts christ and lets him come into his heart it brings a union and the union brings this holy spirit that brings us and marries us to christ that's what this message is it marries to christ what is grace unmerited favor with god unity you know there's all kinds of youth there's a unity of a calling we have a call to serve one another not me myself and now but to serve one another we're not here for ourselves we're here to serve one another brother brown said he said when you're living your life for others you're standing in heaven in the face we've got so many so much selfishness around a lot of times around the mess this they think it's being myself and now but it's serving we are here we're sorry even though sons we're here to serve come on one another gloria we got the unity of the ministry you know the unity of the mirror the spirit and the bride are saying the same thing not two different things one self same word it's not what i think it's not what brother death thinks it's what god thinks he said endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace you can't have peace in what you believe until you receive the holy spirit the revelation of it that's why we see so many times brother brown said talk about so many people tossed to and fro because they don't have the spirit the spirit of god brings unity to another lets you know who you are and what you're here for oh we have a unity with a purpose our unity as the purpose of the bride of jesus christ is to be like him amen not to be like a church certain church or a certain minister to be like christ oh i'm thankful for the grace of god and the message works that i have done bear witness of me 1951 he said look at the disunity in our nation what it's doing look what's happened right now right now this was infinity war we can say that now he said right in the time of war isn't that horrible he said that's a disgrace to our nation he said well it's more than a disgrace to jesus christ a church in this unity it's just before the coming of the lord and the loosening of the antichrist on the earth and here we are separated with denominational barriers i'm methodist he said praise god you could shake him he said you couldn't shake me i'm baptist i'm a seamless of god i'm church of god i'm a pentecostal church oh my he said where are we anyhow he said that's right what's any of us nothing but what god would let us be it's all in the grace of god so let's look to him praise him and and our associate with our brother we can associate on the word right the bible said come and let us reason together over what the word all right jesus said let every man's word be a lie and mind the truth that's good enough for me that'll be good enough for you brother said i didn't i preached just what paul preached right what else could you say right what more could you add to it how could you take away from it it's already finished it's already been said what's supposed to be said right it's already done people are arguing this has got to be done that's gotta be it's already done come on what we gotta comes to the unity is of faith we gotta believe it we gotta leave it right oh my what almighty god remember paul spoke to the corinthians and he said well he said well one one would say i'm a paul i'm of apollos i'm of cephas he said who is paul who is apollos he said i sowed applause water but god gave the increase without the increase there would be nothing but a wet rotten seed takes the quickening power of the holy spirit to bring it alive and that alone what does the word unity mean it means the state of being united or joined as a whole this message don't think is going to bring the bride together as a whole not a toe over here and a foot over here god's not going to have a dismembered body they're all going to come into place what's going to bring us all into place the word amen oh amen the state of being in full agreement robert said that entirely to the token that's why there's so many people that don't have the tokens they're not in full agreement not with me not with you but with the words that's right oh spiritual harmony with the word this unity means just the opposite lack of unity of record well i can't do this and i can't hey you can't until you come under the headship of the word it's not the headset of the pastor it's not the headship of the evangelist it's the headship of the word and the capstone is only going to come down on the full body of christ until we come together to the unity of the faith i like what david said in psalms 33 1 he says behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity what is that unity the word that's what's brought us here this afternoon the word has brought us here together stop being some organization or some man's talk it's been the vindicated words brought us together we can come and say amen oh brothers what a mighty god oh i'm so in love with jesus ain't you you know one of the main reasons the world lacks unity you know and lies broken because man has disunified himself from god right that's what happens to a lot of ministers they get the place where they say well i'm going to do what i want to do and say what i want to but brother said we don't have a thought coming we don't have a say in this thing the holy ghost says it glory oh brothers and sisters it's not what mine in your thoughts is it's what god says unity you know there's power in unity there's strength in it see that's what satan wants to do he wants to put this little ism here and this little israelite the reign separation because he knows unity there's power right here when we all get the character of christ we're going to have the power it already lays within us but god's not going to let us have it until we get the right character because he said power without character is satanic but power with characters fit to rule come on how's he going to let you sit down with him if you ain't fit to rule with him we all want to get into get in the seat but we don't want to be under the mold and the tuner tutorship of the word we want to get to our own way oh my what a mighty god where where we need to go look even the stars testify of unity you don't hear the stars complaining right hey look you're brighter than me north star i need you to come over here it's my turn to shine or the sun and the moon they don't argue they work together in harmony it's not we're not here to make one man better than the other one man lest we're here to lift christ up he's the only great one among us until we realize that we'll never be able to come into the unity of christ like we should the stars testifying you know what the main task of ministers is not theology but what it is is neology we've got too much theology around the message we need some neology where you've had an experience with god where you went on the back side of the desert and you had experience with the holy ghost your burning birth experience then that takes away all your ideas takes away your stinking thinking oh i'm thankful for that because i tell you my my thinking stinks but his is perfect in all the only way we can unite is we unite to the word in the message the total total deliverance 1954. but brown said and that's the same way it is with the church when the church is away from its principles it can never i like it never serve the saints well right when they got to he said we've got to stay together he said got to be unified he said we've got to be one heart and one accord or we'll never serve god or his people right unless we're one heart and one accord right to stand by the principles of the bible and the things that god has saith that's right we must always stand by them gloria i tell you if you don't stand for jesus you're going to fall for anything that's what's wrong they're not standing for jesus they've been following the man they've got their eyes on the man so long they forgot to who the brother was bringing to us christ we got to get our eyes off man and start looking to christ he's the only one that's going to get us out of here he's the only hope we got in acts chapter 4 verse 32 they were in the same heart and soul christ was preeminent in all of it right no schisms no isms not my way not your way god's way glory in beautiful spiritual harmony they continued together the holy ghost brought them together the word bring them together they preached and they taught the gospel exhorting the people to believe what paul or james or john to believe christ the word they had fellowship around the word they believed and kept the commandments because there was the holy ghost keeping them they couldn't do it paul come and told peter said you ain't been able to keep the law why are you trying to make them you know the only way you're going to keep the law is the holy ghost right oh i'm thankful for that they prayed together holding fast a profession of one faith this is not many little messages or many little ideas it's one message christ jesus and him alone oh i'm so thankful for that ain't you we are uniting with the word not a certain idea or a certain thought we're uniting back to the faith that was once delivered to the saints it could only be in this day back to the full restoration of the word see paul had to decrease because he was bringing those ephesians to rapture but it wasn't time there were six more church ages there had to come through that span of time because there was a seventh church age that had to see it had to manifest it what we need to do just get out of the way and say god take away all my thoughts take away all my ideas all my will just let me be what you want me to be thank you it may be humble enough and sincere enough just to let you have your way in my life the church and the bride and the word is being being they're becoming one until the very word itself is working out the words of the bridegroom in the bride right he said you speak it i'll perform it she unites herself what under the word back to the word she's becoming one with the word oh my man i love that the bridegroom and the bride are saying the same thing right not her thoughts but what he's thinking she's saying right amen he said you become so in tune with him that when he does this we'll know exactly what he wants just like a man and wife they come in such harmony that all he has to do he's so confident in us that he just do this and say oh yes i know brother pageant will do what i want him to do now he's in harmony with me i just know yes that's exactly what his word is as good as mine glory my brother christine that's where we're coming to uniting to the headship of the word glory see they can't come to the headship of the word unless they've had a word birth they had an intellectual conception of it they had a good thought they had a good they had good reasoning that they made it real to themselves through their own way but they never had the word birth that's why they're falling away they're having somebody has to fulfill the scriptures said they're shall arise scoffers where can you get a real scruple from he has to come out the message the methodist the baptist all those can't scoff they don't know nothing about it it has to come out from under this that's where they're coming from we ought to feel sorry for them they're fulfilling their day now what i'm saying god let me fulfill my word your word for your day in my life what a mighty god she's becoming the word the bride the hearer of the word come together they become one the word becomes you and you become the word that's what i'm what does he do what we're doing restoring it back to the pentecostal faith not a denomination an experience with the same message and the same signs right they're made evidence by the power of god showing his evidence in us oh i'm so thankful for that right oh what almighty god she unites herself with him which is the word not an organization or a church creed unite with christ and be sure it's him right right but you careful because they're hauling unite and unite not that did we come in one accord we remember we remember back in the days when there was jehoshaphat and ahab they was calling for a uniting come together there's 400 of us and just one of him and they had word they had the word but it was misrepresented it was misplaced it wasn't for him to do it right it was for a certain person to do it god has a certain man to do it what we have to do is get in our place and work with the program no matter how they screamed they hollered but it still didn't come to pass the wrong man was trying to fulfill it that's what's wrong around the message people are trying to make it happen instead of just giving up and let god make it happen what about that in a lying spirit said i will go down i'll go down and get in those prophets huh because they were saying they wasn't saying the whole word of god they just had a problem took a little scripture and said well this is all right with me see a lot of people taking a little quote this is good enough for me i'll take the whole counsel of god the whole word of god how can two walk together unless they agree we can't even the only thing we can agree the holy ghost agrees with the word that's all he eats that's his diet that's his that's his diet he eats the word and nothing else he don't care what you think what men you think it ought to be like he just does he just wants to hear what the word says it is hmm you know nature's rely on a leader sons all of a sudden there's a little duck rises up in the park and he starts squawking louder than any of the rest of him and he starts making sense to those who ordain to follow him but it's just a false quack to the rest of them it don't affect the geese it don't affect the the buzzers it don't affect the crows it just affects the ducks and they come under headship they unite on that leadership that's what god has done in our day he sent a voice crying out and we heard it we heard an eagle scream we left our barnyard we said papa it's you that's right oh what a mighty god trouble with man is he don't know who his leader is that's what's wrong i can tell you who your leader is the holy ghost because he said i'll send you the holy ghost and he shall lead and guide you into all truth and you're thankful for that oh i'm so thankful for the truth this truth really has done a lot for us a lot of times we take it for granted what this truth has brought us to it's brought us to full freedom we're able to exercise our freedom as a christian we can worship god in spirit and in truth not just worshipping them in spirit a lot of people just worship him in spirit some just have truth but he said i'm requiring you to worship me in spirit and in truth it's a unity it's a uniting in the message preserver perseverance he said in 1962 he said if you'd only look up unity comes from god right not man comes from god the power of god when the believer the creation here on earth that god has created is united with god right now then there comes a unity that gives faith he said and when a man sees that he's persistent nobody is going to shake him brother dale i don't care how loud they holler how much they try to disprove it's still the truth and nothing but the truth i've not been persuaded by man paul wasn't persuaded by the apostles he said i went on the backside of the dead that's where rod a lot of them just followed the man because he said a certain thing but they didn't go and get the experience like paul did paul said i didn't confer with none of them i went on the back side of the desert and he showed me to come back saying the same thing he wasn't saying nothing different he was saying the same thing baptizing the same way they were preaching the same thing they was that's spiritual harmony harvest time 1964 he said oh surely god would be in this if we could get together and make a whole world council of churches surely god would be in it he wants unity he wants brotherhood with himself that's good enough that's where i want it he wants you with himself not with the world a brotherhood with himself worship to himself that's what he died for that's what you should want that's what he requires me and you to do is to worship him that way he desires that satan's got a unity called the antichrist he's bringing them together they're throwing commercials they're doing all this come on back home come on back home that's not my home i'm not my home that's mama calling them not me papa's calling me when mama calls she don't deter me i'm listening for papa come on back come on back i never was there if i ever was an uh attribute of god i still am right huh jesus said i came from god and i'm going back he asked us where were you brother christian when the sons and daughters worshiped and shouted brother patrick we was there and i'm going back there not over there it's not going to be here i'm going to meet him over there in the air under the headship of the word can i read you a little quote by charles spurgeon way back in his day talking about the same kind of unity trying to be back then i just love this really stuck me he said to remain divided is sinful did not our lord pray that that they may be one even as we are one saint john 17 22. he said in the course of ecumenical voices keep harping the unity tomb he said what they're saying is christians of all doctrinal shades and beliefs must come together in one visible organization regardless unite unite listen to what he says he said such teaching is false reckless and dangerous he said truth alone must determine our alignments truth comes before unity unity without truth is hazardous our lord in saint john 17 said he said it must be read in its full context we've heard him read this if you've seen that little thing on the thing where he was called them all together he read this he said sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth he said only those sanctified through the word can be one in christ to teach any other wise is to betray the gospel sounds like sounds like a winner to me any other things false false we got to come to the place saying lord this is the truth lord help me to line up with what everybody's trying to do is they've tried to take the message and make it fit them instead of letting the message take them and fit it same way with the bible what is the message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever unchangeable he said here you here's what i'm the lord thy god and i change not for nobody for you for me for anybody he don't change that's what i love about him his first words just found the word amen in the message in absolute 1963 he said we're we he said now you see we are not a divided people we've got to be in unity each one of us is holding a part of god right when we can start seeing that into one another we'll start treating one another a lot different than we do what we do we don't we're not seeing that part of god in each other we're too busy looking at the outward and he said try the spirit know whether it's a god he said that we must come together and then the pillar of fire is manifested your little late brother donnie my little lip your little lip comes again and that brings the pillow fire he said in the wholeness in the fullness of it he said when his church sits together in heavenly places the fullness of the power of god is in his church each one of us holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together brings that pillar of fire back again we want to see the pillow fight we got to come together on the headship of the word lay down our little penny any difference just don't mean nothing to god hmm let me read you something in the message harvest time he said god is uniting his bride she's coming together from the east from the west from the north and south there's a uniting time and that's on right now what is she uniting for the rapture he said amen god is getting ready yes sir united what is she uniting with with the word boy i love that for all the heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away she's uniting herself with thus saith the lord regardless of what denomination or anybody else say she's uniting herself she's getting ready why she is the bride he said that's right and she's united herself with the bridegroom and the bridegroom is the word glory in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us little messiahs is what we are he said in the church and the bride and the word is becoming one until the very word itself is working out the works of the bridegroom amen he said you see it a uniting time no more join the church not no more this but flee from everything and tie to jesus christ see it's the uniting time god's uniting his bride together bringing it back just exactly uniting the word of his promise he said first thessalonians says that the saints that are asleep in the dust of the earth will awaken and we will unite with them the living ones with the ones that's been dead that's right we will unite before we even go up there because the bride will be complete when she gets there the ones that are living that have united himself with the word and those that are gone already that did that he said all of it comes together to make one great union of uniting before going up there glory amen thank you lord that's good enough for me you can call it say what you want to but it's good enough for me hey man call me crazy but i'm crazy happy amen i may have been this happy before look at what the prophet said in here in the message shalom what's causing this the darkness is separating itself from the light it came the stronger the light comes to bring this uniting of the word the bride and the one becoming sir the darkness is separating the light is forcing it to do it it's forcing if you're not light you can't connect to it you can't unite to it it's forcing on brother christian forcing them to do this he said it's coming to bring when the light comes i'm going to reveal it and the lights come he said god has caused it the light is doing it it's not me it's not you god has caused it the light is doing it see the light is pressing itself in such a way until the darkness has to congratulate itself together congregate itself together he said they had a chance to accept it and they wouldn't do it so he said condensed itself so it's condensed itself and they that do that by the putting the church together and the council of churches and the uniting it with pagan darkness when they so firmly disagree with one another but they had to go together to make the night come upon the people they've had to to bring the full darkness for them amen the only light they've been walking in is what god has left here for the bride and now there's making them come together to make it darker on them a greater condemnation lord oh think about it brothers and sisters he said in the message oneness he said now don't you see the great picture he said we in flesh are different we're like a byproduct he said a created being by holy wedlock he said but in the spirit we are sons and daughters not some other spirit but the spirit of the living god lest it live in you he said cry been paul say christ in you the hope of glory we are in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image of the living god because we are sons and daughters not separated but the same spirit the same god the same person joined in wedlock to the eternal see how god planned it that we should be not different but him not as some other being of some other tribe but a real union an offspring of all of the almighty done by a holy union right you're the offspring of god glory huh so if he's your father and your his spirit lives in you you're gonna work out the acts of him just like you had the spirit of john delanger you're gonna have a criminal spirit in you you're gonna want to kill you're gonna want to rob that's how he said try the spirit know whether it's a god or not you got that spirit of arguing and wanting to fight listen this really just blowed me away when brother brown said this in the message one this he said the disciples even walking with jesus they didn't have oneness think about it he said they didn't have any unity no they argued sounds like a lot of message people don't who's going to be the bishop after this everybody's been trying to take brother brown's place since he left i want to be the big honcho now they ain't nobody big among except christ he said who's the greatest among us he said they couldn't even believe jesus they couldn't understand him they said they'll speak us in riddles tell us plainly what you mean he said there was no unity between the disciples and jesus think about that huh he said jesus to he said jesus to them he told them don't you preach no more or even try right if you're going to act like that don't even try he said wait in jerusalem i'm going to see you i'm going to send you a promise that will unify you then right and nobody's saying well you know me and james is going to sit over here and y'all going to be we're going to be the main one here now peter you just watch us we're gonna really show out now he said see god wasn't in them yet they were just associated all right well we've got a lot of people just associated with this message listen to what the brother brim said this really stuck me when he said they were just associated in fellowship with listen to what the prophet said he said that's many good men today they wasn't one with god yet what brings that one is the holy ghost right we've got a lot of associations around the message but we want to be one with god what a unity when god united himself in the human body the greatest of all unitings he said god united with man left his great strand of being god and stretched forth his tent and took in humanity and became one of them unity that brought peace between god and man forever not this unity brought peace between god and man forever he said how thankful we are to be right my goodness couldn't even get along with one another huh it's wrong a lot of people well i got i got i'm gonna prove my point here you know i don't have a point to prove it's already been proved that's what god said that's all i got if i say what he says brother just said say what i say and you'll be all right you know but you can't even say what the problem said unless you've got the holy ghost you'll throw your little your little two cents in there then you know what that just throws it all out of country continuity when the prophet said we don't got to say coming in this thing i'm glad that boy what i say i'd be a lot of people be in trouble from what i said brother dale you know the same for you faith the faith of abraham as long as the devil can keep you separated that's as good as he wants it wow he said you'll never go forward like that right he said do you know how the indians lost this nation to the white man they were not united he said we're going to lose it again by not being united look at america now we've got this with this thought republicans is fighting among the republicans the democrats fighting among the democrats the impenders fighting ain't no unity what brings you to the word right oh i'm glad we got the truth the truth has set us free where i'm fixing to finish here he said i will restore 1950 cent 1957. he said pentecost has a disease a disease it's got a lot of fungus growing on it he said that's right all of our churches have fungus growing on them so boy he just sucked us right in there we better watch it we need god to spiritually examine and say lord what are we we don't want no fungus on us we don't know no fungus among us we could say it that way he said we've left let that old palmer worm does that name sound familiar he said come along with his stinger and break down brotherhood break down unity among us paul said in the bible that he wanted us to all speak the same thing he wanted us to all be in unity amen aren't you thankful for that amen i'm so thankful for the grace of god aren't you i'm going to read one more quote and i'm going to let you stand amen he said in an absolute he said now you see we're not a divided people we've got to be in unity because each one of us is holding a part of god and we must come together and then the pillar fires manifested i just read that he said it again in absolute i said out of the mouth of two or three witnesses said the wholeness the fullness when his church sits together in heavenly places then the fullness of the power of god in his church each one of us holding spiritual gifts spiritual offices coming together brings that pillar fire back we want the pillow fire working among us again then we got to come back to the word come back to the truth the word of god has set us free right amen we can't unite ourselves nothing but the word there's nothing wrong with having fellowship right now loving one of jesus didn't say stop loving one another he said let's unite to the word now we'll go so far but when this when it's contrary to the word then we'll say wait a minute i'm gonna keep on walking with the word right i'm gonna pray for you that you get back in line that's right probably said some of them got out of step said he had to scream stay in line little lebron that's all the

handshake or an a thing or some kind of intellectual thought of what this is supposed to be it's not might in your thoughts it's his do we come into that one accord under the influence of the holy ghost the holy ghost brought them in one accord they was fussing and fighting and arguing until the holy ghost come and it bring them all together right holding the word the message of the hour bring
