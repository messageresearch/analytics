[10:44] Oh
[10:49] and I want to see a man and a man and a
[10:57] man I want to see him don't you
[10:58] there's neva everybody in the house and
[11:01] the Lord we'd like to turn to
[11:02] revelations 21 we will read from there
[11:08] remember now the announcements have been
[11:10] made that we will be having the Spring
[11:16] Festival this coming Saturday starting
[11:19] at 1:00 and so remember that and then
[11:22] remember the other announcements
[11:24] Mississippi we have some more but just
[11:27] Pratt the Lord would bless each and
[11:30] every one of us remember all the ones
[11:31] that are sick and are not here among us
[11:34] in judgment Lord we do I would like for
[11:37] you to do something in farm of course
[11:38] it's hard to do but it's just a joke
[11:40] anyway but could everybody move over a
[11:44] little bit toward the wall it just kind
[11:48] of move over toward the wall now I'm
[11:56] trying to illustrate something you see
[11:59] how many seats it would be extra if
[12:02] everybody made sure they took a bath on
[12:05] Sunday and used the odorant you know and
[12:08] everything and they would make room for
[12:11] more people because we do have a problem
[12:15] here that we want to sit down and go you
[12:19] know like this and it makes it a little
[12:21] bit more inconvenient you know to do
[12:27] that now that's one of those things I
[12:29] was missing it to my nephew the other
[12:31] day I said we got to do something I said
[12:33] the church is getting so full we don't
[12:35] have no room he said that's a problem
[12:38] you know to him it hit men of joy he
[12:42] said that's a problem that's a deal you
[12:44] can get back over again ain't nobody
[12:46] coming in but that's just what I mean
[12:48] that if you see an opportunity to be
[12:53] able to change things
[12:55] maybe families learn to set together our
[12:59] to do or whatever we try to reserve some
[13:02] of the back for the little children
[13:04] because that's just the opportunity but
[13:07] we're not down and out about it we're
[13:10] enjoy but what can we do about it we'd
[13:14] like to have a bigger place but that's
[13:17] just not in the in the makings you know
[13:21] to where we could do that so we just
[13:23] have to maybe sit a little closer
[13:24] together you know and put mark and his
[13:29] brother right together you know or that
[13:31] they do favor anyway so we can do that
[13:35] but just in just to do that and we're
[13:38] glad for that to be it you know to do
[13:43] and you you've already prayed I know for
[13:45] sister Freda did she come on up that she
[13:49] was having trouble with her sugar and I
[13:52] don't know where she come on in the
[13:53] building and whatever but we prayed and
[13:56] we believe everything he'll be all right
[13:58] so remember that okay so we eat we've
[14:02] got all the announcements mate all right
[14:04] so let's just go right on the end of the
[14:06] scripture and let the Lord have his way
[14:10] with each one father we thank you for
[14:12] the day and the grace that you've given
[14:13] unto us the hour that we have upon the
[14:16] earth and we pray that you would just
[14:19] got each and every one of us and let us
[14:21] Lord walking you and help us to to look
[14:25] to you the author and finisher of our
[14:27] faith and to know that you are the one
[14:29] to guide each and every one of us have
[14:31] your way remember the sick ones among us
[14:34] Lord there's many different ones that
[14:35] are sick and and everything in aids
[14:38] getting on to us and things Lord we ask
[14:41] you to just hasten the day and get us
[14:45] out of here we pray for you to come
[14:47] quickly because we see the things coming
[14:50] to pice that are supposed to be there in
[14:54] the end time the world and the situation
[14:56] the religious world city the things Lord
[14:59] and we ask you to just come quickly and
[15:02] get us out of this we love you and we
[15:04] thank you in Jesus name Amen
[15:08] revelations 21
[15:13] and I saw a new heaven and a new earth
[15:18] for the first heaven and the first earth
[15:21] was passed away and there was no more
[15:24] sea and I John solved the holy city New
[15:27] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[15:30] heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[15:32] her husband remember John explains the
[15:36] bride like the city and explains a city
[15:39] like a bride because it goes together
[15:40] alright and I heard a great voice out of
[15:44] heaven saying behold the tabernacle of
[15:46] God is with men and he will dwell with
[15:49] them and they shall be his people and
[15:51] God himself shall be with them and be
[15:53] their God and God shall wipe away all
[15:56] tears from their eyes and there shall be
[15:58] no more death neither sorrow nor crying
[16:02] neither shall there be any more pain for
[16:06] the former things the ones are passed
[16:10] away whatever caused it all of this pain
[16:14] problem heartache trouble death etc by
[16:17] this time that's gone alright so we'll
[16:21] keep that in your mind now and either
[16:23] set up on the throne said behold I make
[16:25] all things new and said unto me write
[16:29] for these words are true and faithful
[16:32] you may be seated to the Lord that is
[16:34] blessing to the reading of the word now
[16:39] we'll get to that scripture in a moment
[16:42] and try to talk on these things a little
[16:47] bit but what I want you to do is to make
[16:50] sure we've had quite a few services
[16:52] talking about the all in all and I hope
[16:57] you've enjoyed it but to me you know I'm
[17:02] just to this point of view that when you
[17:06] say the all and in all we know that it
[17:10] doesn't mean that he's in everybody now
[17:12] but he ever born-again believer any were
[17:17] see which would be the bride with
[17:20] eternal life then that's the all and all
[17:24] alright
[17:25] now then we covered that when you come
[17:30] to the next stage of your form of
[17:32] redemption you've got you feel feel jus
[17:34] that would come up and see then he's all
[17:38] and all to them because he didn't with
[17:41] them according to what he's revealing
[17:45] himself to them the redemption you know
[17:48] being redeemed all right now see then we
[17:52] went through covering that 144,000
[17:55] because the fish feel Jewett says in
[17:57] Revelation six eleven you know that they
[18:00] get white robes and are told to wait
[18:01] until their fellow brethren now you may
[18:04] find a quote of stating that the
[18:09] officials you or people that you were
[18:11] looking at it you may find a quote
[18:13] Darfur the Prophet saying that that that
[18:15] would be the white throne where they'd
[18:17] get their white robes but remember what
[18:19] the Bible says the Bible says for them
[18:23] to rest and white robes were given unto
[18:26] them the until your fellow brethren and
[18:31] the Prophet said that's your 144,000
[18:33] that are killed all right so just keep
[18:37] that in mind as a reason we covered that
[18:39] away but it's the plan of redemption for
[18:41] different people that's what I've been
[18:44] trying to express so you can take the
[18:47] all and all to the bride dinner and
[18:49] that's all he's all and he's in all
[18:51] he'll be in everyone that is given
[18:54] eternal life alright then when you come
[18:57] to the field field you that's a special
[18:59] group of people that will be given
[19:02] eternal life but remember what we were
[19:06] talking about it last night the Bride of
[19:08] Christ is the only group I covered I
[19:10] think four groups but the Bride of
[19:13] Christ is the only group that there's no
[19:15] death to it she's going to be changed
[19:19] now we may die but somebody in the bride
[19:23] is going to be changed and don't have to
[19:26] die but for redemption from there on out
[19:29] anybody that saved on Pais the bride
[19:32] across they have to die the fields you
[19:37] dies
[19:40] $144,000 the two witnesses die the
[19:43] foolish virgins die so that's why I was
[19:46] covering the all and in all
[19:48] because each time he imparts eternal
[19:51] life and he doesn't impart eternal life
[19:53] to the bride you know wait a minute well
[19:57] just listen to what were saying he
[19:59] doesn't impart it's not an impartation
[20:02] to you and me he imparted to Adam and
[20:06] Eve eternal life but we receive eternal
[20:09] God life by the process of redemption
[20:12] that we go through of justification
[20:15] sanctification baptism with the Holy
[20:17] Ghost and we receive it from that
[20:20] alright but do you get what I'm saying
[20:22] then see they know all in all it's the
[20:24] bride okay then you can say they all in
[20:28] all is the fulfills you to be given
[20:31] eternal life then you say they all in
[20:34] all is 144,000 because he's still
[20:38] dealing with redemption right see if you
[20:44] just say redemption for us you know
[20:47] where I gave you a quote derp ssundee
[20:50] that brother run says now these redeemed
[20:53] he said but he said that's not the bride
[20:57] he said the brides in the city well I
[20:59] see everything can be anybody that ever
[21:02] gets eternal life will be redeemed from
[21:06] a situation that they existed in and
[21:09] brought forth in to eternal life right
[21:12] all right but there's covering it or you
[21:14] get it all laid in order and then you
[21:17] don't cross up your your examples in the
[21:21] scriptures and see then you can cover
[21:23] the bride then you can cover the white
[21:26] the fear fills you then you cover the
[21:29] 144,000 in their Redemption then you
[21:33] cover the foolish version that's why
[21:34] thrown to be given eternal life but when
[21:38] the white throne judgment is done
[21:41] that's the life's redemption there is no
[21:44] redemption theis the white throne well I
[21:47] don't like you call that a watch on the
[21:50] rejection well you tell me what it is
[21:53] they're safe from their sins
[21:55] they're given eternal life in their soul
[21:58] all right and see then those things are
[22:01] there for us to get understanding but
[22:04] just get the point then I'll try to move
[22:06] on the bride somebody you might not be
[22:12] but one person but somebody don't have
[22:15] to die because the Bible says you'd be
[22:19] changed the moment a twink live or die
[22:20] but that's not so for anybody else in
[22:23] any form of redemption because in any
[22:27] form of redemption after the end by
[22:29] anybody they have to die whether it be
[22:33] field view whether it be 144,000 whether
[22:37] it be the two witnesses and don't get me
[22:41] wrong now a big man in this message he
[22:46] taught her did teach that those two
[22:49] witnesses and and all of those others
[22:51] didn't have to die I said well we was in
[22:55] a Bible study one night or her you know
[22:59] point the ministers meeting I said well
[23:02] according to the Prophet they died and
[23:05] according to the Bible they died yeah
[23:10] well I mean did that solve the problem
[23:13] no called brother Sancho said it well I
[23:17] don't care who someone so says what when
[23:20] the word says it I believe the word
[23:22] first all right that this settled that
[23:25] you know we stay with that point and
[23:27] then we line it up with that to where we
[23:30] can see but get get the final point of
[23:32] what I'm saying when we get to that
[23:35] future home state all right now remember
[23:40] we've read it go we're gonna get to that
[23:42] in a second you get a new heaven and a
[23:44] new earth then you get a city to come
[23:49] down all right so everything at that
[23:52] point will be redeemed all right then
[23:58] there won't be any redemption after then
[24:02] it'll all be settled and over with by
[24:05] that time
[24:06] the future home comes down upon the
[24:07] earth the Prophet said it would land
[24:10] like it did on Jesus on a redeemed
[24:13] entire earth all right so the plan of
[24:16] redemption will be over when the future
[24:18] homelands upon this earth the whole
[24:21] redemptive plan of God will be finished
[24:24] all right and that way see then you can
[24:26] cover the all and all you remember how
[24:28] tried to explain something one time cuz
[24:30] this is the way I see it you take the
[24:34] coming of the Lord you got to come into
[24:36] the bride you got to come in with to
[24:38] Israel you got to coming in the
[24:40] Millennium all is the coming of the Lord
[24:44] well each one of those who saw but you
[24:48] cross this scripture up with this
[24:50] scripture and what have you got that's
[24:55] where the problem is with the people of
[24:57] the message they don't know the Bible so
[25:03] thereby not knowing the Bible they can't
[25:05] put it together correct and I don't mean
[25:06] everybody I'm just making a statement
[25:08] when I say that I'm not trying to show
[25:11] how smart I am I'm just telling you the
[25:14] God's honest truth if you got any sense
[25:16] you know it's true
[25:17] is that plain enough we've talked about
[25:21] it last night you know you don't have to
[25:23] tell a woman at one time right around
[25:25] said it's wrong war plans right he's
[25:29] born again well see there's any thing
[25:35] that we come well brother so-and-so said
[25:38] it's okay to cut your hair I don't care
[25:41] what he says
[25:42] the Bible says don't do it and if the
[25:45] Bible is in me and you if God wouldn't
[25:48] cut his hair God wouldn't drink smoke
[25:51] right now then a born-again believers
[25:54] not supposed to either so that solves
[25:56] the problem
[25:58] that's his blunders can be that's why I
[26:00] preach the way I do
[26:01] I don't preach hard dress and clothes
[26:03] well I preach the born-again experience
[26:05] you get born again it'll take care of
[26:07] the dress and hire and the clothes and
[26:08] then if it don't take care of it you're
[26:11] not born again but people don't like it
[26:14] that plain they want it's all choked a
[26:18] little you know
[26:19] it's too late to be soft soap just it's
[26:21] just plain language we either believe
[26:23] the Bible or we don't believe about but
[26:27] now you see what I'm talking about then
[26:28] so then that didn't end my thought it
[26:34] just opened up into greater things when
[26:37] we talk about the all and all we just
[26:40] get the layout of how this takes place
[26:43] this takes place this takes place this
[26:46] takes place it's all the plan of
[26:48] salvation it's all Redemption alright
[26:52] but it puts it into the degrees of where
[26:55] you're at see everybody's not a
[26:57] born-again believer everybody's not a
[27:00] the prop the Bride of Christ but there's
[27:03] Redemption forum that's one it was so
[27:08] much to me when when it come into the
[27:10] message are in 67 you know they're
[27:14] saying Redemption was over us according
[27:16] the Bible is over for the world well we
[27:22] see that wasn't their point that you
[27:24] know and like I said you can you can
[27:27] feel assured for one thing the people
[27:30] that talked that believed they were
[27:32] already born again all right they
[27:35] couldn't go admit the other part alright
[27:37] but now listen so that makes the all and
[27:41] in all
[27:42] in the time the future home transpires
[27:47] upon this earth the redemptive plan will
[27:51] be over with everything that will get
[27:54] eternal life will already have eternal
[27:57] life you said well this anybody there
[27:58] that don't have it I don't see how they
[28:01] can because the Bible said he makes all
[28:03] things new
[28:03] I believe when in the future home comes
[28:08] to this earth it'll be a total the
[28:10] entire redeemed earth all things will be
[28:15] made new and that's what we're getting
[28:16] at the point today to see it and if it's
[28:20] all made new alright see then why try to
[28:25] figure out all these other things
[28:27] accepted of what it's done when that
[28:30] happens it will be to that pole
[28:33] all right now then making that point we
[28:39] need to remember one thing that the Word
[28:47] of God is true
[28:50] all right I'm settled okay so then you
[28:55] know it'll be the Regained giving these
[28:57] little notes out of the way the word
[28:59] that I can get back to work we want to
[29:01] go to all right now let's go back now
[29:04] and as I said we're not ending the all
[29:07] in all we're still involved in it but we
[29:12] want to approach it a little different
[29:14] to where you can see what I'm talking
[29:16] about
[29:16] all right so let's go now back and read
[29:20] our scripture that we read so pull that
[29:22] back up number one brothers then let's
[29:25] read that scripture that we just read
[29:27] okay
[29:29] the revelation is 21 know what's what he
[29:38] says I saw a new heaven and a new earth
[29:42] for the first heaven and the first Earth
[29:46] were passed away and there was no more
[29:50] sea
[29:50] all right now so the first heaven the
[29:54] first earth is passed away the Prophet
[29:57] said from the message Satan's Eden which
[30:05] we'll get to in a minute take it pull it
[30:07] up number three if they want to pull it
[30:09] on up since there's no more seed the
[30:13] first heaven and the first earth where
[30:15] Pyatt was passed away what was our first
[30:18] heavens was the millennium the
[30:24] millennium is to be the first heavens
[30:29] when it's covered it like this and you
[30:32] said now the first heavens was this
[30:34] backyard is up in the sky was a better
[30:36] way he's talking about a situation to
[30:39] explaining the scriptures all right what
[30:44] was our first heavens
[30:46] it's the Millennium because that's God
[30:49] ruling over earth as the first heaven
[30:53] because the first earth the first heaven
[30:57] watching now what's the first earth
[31:02] having an earth gonna pass away with
[31:05] God's words gonna bide forever
[31:06] and once what was the first earth was
[31:10] this this is the first earth where we're
[31:13] living the Millennium will be the first
[31:15] heaven that comes into view as God
[31:18] ruling over earth because remember the
[31:23] time he fabric time man failed you
[31:27] couldn't count it even in the garden as
[31:30] being a heaven so we'd go to it up in an
[31:34] IR we go top of this that remember what
[31:37] it's saying the first earth is now we're
[31:44] living on the first earth the first
[31:47] heaven is the Millennium okay but now
[31:51] remember the scripture the scripture
[31:55] says the first heaven and the first
[31:57] earth is passed away no no the
[32:02] millennium will come to an end
[32:04] or so will this earth as far as an end
[32:06] of this earth not annihilated we've we
[32:10] know the message here's your home right
[32:12] it's not Annihilator its redeemed it's
[32:17] changed it's made into a situation that
[32:20] can be used we'll get to that in a
[32:22] minute on what the scripture is actually
[32:24] saying but you understand right now what
[32:28] in the message what was first heaven and
[32:32] the first Earth were passed away what
[32:34] was our first heavens was the Millennium
[32:36] once the first earth was this it'll be
[32:39] renovated just like it was baptised in
[32:42] the days of Noah and the Reno come for
[32:45] the baptism she'll birth forth and come
[32:47] forth a new earth and not a different
[32:50] earth we know the message I'll not try
[32:53] to spend much time on that this earth is
[32:56] not annihilated that's the key to it
[33:00] see we thought when it said to having an
[33:03] earth advise away you know or be no more
[33:06] well that does wait wait it's gonna be
[33:08] blowed away with where we're gonna be
[33:09] I mean we're going to another planet and
[33:14] start over you know know the future
[33:19] homes gonna be right here right do we
[33:22] know the message enough for everybody
[33:23] understand that we don't have to worry
[33:25] about it this is dry here's where the
[33:29] new heaven is going to be this is the
[33:31] center of the universe oh no science
[33:34] says it's going to wear out here we blow
[33:35] the whistle Mimi I don't care what to
[33:37] say this is the center of the universe
[33:40] you know why go to ever'where God is is
[33:43] where the center of the universe it
[33:44] where's God going to be at the future oh
[33:49] he's gonna be right here so ever where
[33:53] he's at right there will be no more of
[33:58] that it's all be finished look I saw a
[34:00] new heaven and new earth first heaven
[34:02] the first earth was passed away there
[34:04] was no more sea now John saw the holy
[34:06] city New Jerusalem but sent him from God
[34:08] out of heaven there will be with our God
[34:11] will be with his true attributes sons
[34:14] and daughters but where we can
[34:17] fellowship with them in holiness with
[34:20] their lives behind it of seeing okay now
[34:23] going back to the scripture now go back
[34:25] to number one and I saw a new heaven a
[34:29] new earth for the first heaven and the
[34:32] first Earth were passed away all right
[34:37] there was no more sea now and I joined
[34:42] saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming
[34:44] down from God out of heaven prepared as
[34:47] a bride for her husband okay like I said
[34:51] we've been through the whole thing that
[34:53] big old long word that means to redeem
[34:56] or change is not to annihilate this
[34:59] world is not to be blowed away is to be
[35:05] redeemed
[35:05] now as far as seeing on it and this is
[35:09] my points of defining sin as far as any
[35:13] oh well drilled to get all is going to
[35:17] be cleansed because that's mankind in
[35:21] their garbage alright so then that's
[35:25] just a point of my the way I try to
[35:27] illustrate what will happen the prophet
[35:31] covered it we don't have to worry about
[35:32] it the world is not going to be
[35:36] annihilated the same word for the world
[35:39] to be done away it's the same word for
[35:42] you in your born-again experience the
[35:45] same word as Toulouse the coat and let
[35:48] it come forth all of those the plan of
[35:52] redemption to be made new now watch that
[35:57] in a minute when we get to the
[35:58] definition we're to be made new he's
[36:03] going to redeem this earth not
[36:06] annihilate it because remember our
[36:09] bodies come out of this earth so now
[36:13] that's that should be enough to solve
[36:15] the problem of that now watch and I
[36:19] heard a great voice out of heaven saying
[36:21] behold the tabernacle of God is with men
[36:25] and he was they'll dwell with them and
[36:28] they shall be his people and God himself
[36:31] shall be with them and be their God
[36:33] now all and all will be complete then
[36:37] remember what I said while ago
[36:39] everything that will ever be redeemed by
[36:42] the time the future home are the city
[36:45] lands on earth all the redemptive plan
[36:49] will be finished no matter what you want
[36:53] to bring it up it'll be finished because
[36:54] it's in order I'd like to do it too you
[36:58] know one day I'll get it to you think
[37:00] think of it but I'm like this I like to
[37:03] have things in order all right the
[37:06] Prophet said what's the next time
[37:08] rapture for the bride now I'm giving his
[37:12] definite he said the next thing will be
[37:14] the two witnesses to the Jews he said
[37:17] next to be the millennium which will be
[37:20] right at the end for week under and then
[37:22] would be Armageddon and then the
[37:25] millennium
[37:27] and then gog and magog and in the future
[37:31] home alright he gives her an order well
[37:35] yeah they will come up with a he'll say
[37:37] it like this and what people go haywire
[37:39] you'll say if you don't see you know
[37:41] more well see you in the millennium the
[37:44] next thing is the millennium cuz he said
[37:47] he'd see us in the millennium he didn't
[37:49] say that
[37:50] that's your definition as to what it is
[37:55] that's not what he's saying he just said
[37:59] if I don't see you anymore I'm like this
[38:01] I can say to you if I don't see you
[38:03] anymore I'll see you next week
[38:05] well you know what that means I won't
[38:08] say none of you till next week I mean
[38:10] some of you I won't say the next week
[38:13] it's simple but yet we we make it but
[38:16] the Prophet said the next thing is the
[38:19] woman he didn't say that he just making
[38:23] a statement yet we want to make it that
[38:25] way and try to make him to worry that
[38:29] he's correct and you know you're not
[38:30] correcting the word he's telling that's
[38:32] what the word says I've been out listen
[38:36] God shall wipe away all tears heard a
[38:40] great voice out of heaven behold the
[38:42] tabernacle of God is with men and he
[38:44] will dwell with them
[38:45] there'll be his people and God Himself
[38:47] will be with them and be their God and
[38:49] God shall wipe away all tears now watch
[38:54] what all things that are ended by the
[38:56] time the city lands on earth there'll be
[38:59] no more cry there'd be no more weeping
[39:02] there'll be no more death than being a
[39:04] Massaro
[39:05] there'll be no crying more pain for the
[39:09] former things are passed away anything
[39:14] in relation to any form of unhappiness
[39:20] whether it be crying death sorrow by the
[39:26] time that future home lands on this
[39:27] earth all that's done what a wonderful
[39:31] place to be living
[39:33] it'll be your home and you as the bride
[39:38] gets to stay in the city
[39:41] now watch and either set up on the
[39:45] throne said behold I make all things new
[39:50] and he said unto me write for these
[39:54] words are true and faithful I make all
[39:57] things new no as I said it's not an
[40:04] annihilation of the world the new birth
[40:07] never annihilated you it annihilated to
[40:11] sin in your soul right but he didn't
[40:18] annihilate you you're still the same
[40:21] person it's just a point that you don't
[40:25] have you know how to worry about the
[40:27] death right now the sorrow see no matter
[40:30] how much I cry out or the inwardly I'm
[40:33] not crying why because that's where he's
[40:37] living so we can take that and do it now
[40:40] listen that word to make new go ahead
[40:47] and pull up number two now remember I'll
[40:49] make all things new now what does that
[40:56] word new mean just 25:37
[41:02] as respects form in other words it's
[41:09] gonna change in form it's talking about
[41:12] form it's gonna change in form look
[41:15] something recently made now what
[41:18] something new something recently made
[41:20] something fresh something recent
[41:24] something unused unworn new which was
[41:31] recently made and once which as recently
[41:35] made is superior to what it succeeds are
[41:42] you listening
[41:47] anything made it's made new it's made
[41:50] superior they got a new Thunderbird many
[41:57] years ago they come up with a new shape
[41:59] looking Thunderbird then 10 years ago
[42:02] we'll say whatever it look now which one
[42:06] if you want something to do for drive
[42:08] and and to do if you want something to
[42:11] look at you want the old Thunderbird
[42:18] if you won't something right in you want
[42:23] the new one right why because it
[42:27] supersedes what was original
[42:30] so look what he's gonna do to the earth
[42:33] he's gonna make it greater or you know
[42:35] then what it was the greatest we could
[42:38] think of the Garden of Eden will be
[42:40] nothing compared to the future home
[42:46] right code is gonna be made news he made
[42:51] is superior to what it succeeds as
[42:54] respect the substance of a new kind
[43:00] unprecedented which means in other words
[43:02] uncompelled to honor
[43:05] it means uncommon unheard of you know
[43:09] right now think about what he's saying
[43:14] he describes a new heaven and a new
[43:19] earth verse 1 because the first heaven
[43:24] and the first earth are passed away not
[43:28] an ayah lated passed away it's been
[43:32] redeemed
[43:34] alright it's going to come forth as more
[43:38] superior because it's going to be made
[43:41] new it will be a greater than anything
[43:47] right now see how you could go back in
[43:53] the Old Testament pick up when they made
[43:56] you know the temple in
[43:59] the latter temple how much was greater
[44:02] than the former warmer by been prettier
[44:05] but the latter had a lot more to do with
[44:07] it all right
[44:08] but now listen I created new heaven and
[44:12] a new earth
[44:16] he's gonna make all things new okay
[44:21] there'll be no sorrow no cry no death
[44:26] for all of those former things are
[44:28] passed away and he they set up on the
[44:33] throne I got a little comment about that
[44:40] about you see you don't know how when
[44:43] you say sitting on the throne on the
[44:45] throne of David I don't have any
[44:47] reference that there's a throne sitting
[44:49] there and y'all got to come and bow to
[44:50] the throne the throne is in your hearts
[44:53] your but yet there will be a place in
[44:56] the Millennium there will be a throne
[45:02] they will be a temple mate but you won't
[45:07] have no animal sacrifices and stuff like
[45:09] that in the millennial reign that's all
[45:13] gone oh but father me now if he said I'm
[45:17] gonna make all things new
[45:21] now the first heaven is the Millennium
[45:24] the first earth is now so he's going to
[45:29] redeem he's going to make it new he's
[45:35] not going to annihilate it he's going to
[45:39] redeem it and if he redeems it what does
[45:42] he do
[45:44] how does he redeem your soul by giving
[45:49] you eternal life right how is it that
[45:56] he's to redeem the world not making any
[45:59] terminal why would you not want it made
[46:06] eternal I'm asking you the question you
[46:10] know but I don't believe it's the world
[46:12] be made eternal
[46:13] I don't live well why why don't you want
[46:17] to believe that well I don't believe
[46:20] everybody will be eternal in that future
[46:22] home well where do you get it from
[46:25] I got it solved right there if there's
[46:30] going to be a fact that the heavens and
[46:33] earth is to pass away has to make all
[46:36] things new not annihilate it to make it
[46:40] new then why would we not believe that
[46:43] it'll all be eternal then why leave a
[46:49] situation that could in some way reoccur
[46:53] again well that's what a lot of people
[46:55] think see it goes to show you what
[46:58] you're thinking you're thinking this
[47:01] thing's not over with here your thinking
[47:03] is just started you never heard that one
[47:05] I've heard ministers try to explain this
[47:07] is just we're gonna start another world
[47:09] we're gonna have another City we're
[47:11] gonna have another this why what far
[47:23] you know why would you want to exist in
[47:27] the world it's not new or eternal why
[47:35] would you want to leave any telltale
[47:37] part of anywhere and remember gog and
[47:43] magog is not only an annihilation of the
[47:50] world systems its anihilation of the
[47:53] devils the demons the angels and things
[47:57] that went wrong
[48:01] see that's not happening in Armageddon
[48:05] Armageddon will be more like a nuclear
[48:07] in style world situation Gog and Magog
[48:11] will be destroying ever affect our
[48:16] thought our point of the devil and his
[48:20] angels well then why wouldn't you want
[48:23] to thank new well and what it is is just
[48:25] made new what's the difference with god
[48:31] of making something over again letting
[48:33] it start again or why not just make it
[48:35] new because listen folks I've asked you
[48:43] to read and listen to two things and
[48:46] when you do why don't you read with
[48:48] common sense when that world eventually
[48:55] strikes the eighth day there won't be no
[48:59] starting over 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 what
[49:07] is only a type that's only a type some
[49:15] water this thing is going to be made new
[49:18] and be greater than its original
[49:22] condition of the Garden of Eden that's
[49:26] the definition of the word you say yeah
[49:32] but
[49:32] it's just if you just get to listener no
[49:34] you're not listening you're not paying
[49:36] attention to the Prophet because the
[49:40] mankind is a told you mankind had always
[49:44] talked the rest of the baptism of the
[49:50] Holy Ghost at Jesus all you churches
[49:52] teach that that Jesus come and made a
[49:56] way for that rest to be imparted to you
[49:58] and I but why would they come up to a
[50:01] prophet and say yeah but now you've run
[50:04] out of your sevens one of these days
[50:12] ever type shadow or anything of eternal
[50:18] life will be annihilated when he turned
[50:20] a life is in full view what a beautiful
[50:23] place when you strike the number eight
[50:28] it's finished God has made all things
[50:33] new everything's not made new when you
[50:36] stand under seven seven forty-nine
[50:39] that's just a repeat you just start over
[50:42] you start over your prophet didn't cover
[50:45] that future home I've asked you to read
[50:47] it and listen to it read it over and
[50:50] over and study it why would they say you
[50:56] have run out of tops because see that's
[51:01] their tops their tops
[51:03] top the baptism the Baptist Church
[51:06] taught the the the rest day that Jesus
[51:09] was talking about coming to me all ye
[51:11] that labor and heavy laden I'll give you
[51:12] rest the Baptist Church people thought
[51:15] that was the new birth they might not
[51:17] have understood a lot about it but they
[51:19] called it your church world teaches it
[51:24] but they teach it and it ends with a
[51:27] seven because they just started over one
[51:29] two three four five six seven one two
[51:31] three four five six one two three four
[51:32] five six
[51:33] that's only attacks when you're dealing
[51:38] on the top remember the top is not
[51:42] always perfect
[51:48] because this watch the top
[51:52] would you see there is an eighth day
[51:58] there is an eternal life why because
[52:02] it's when I always make new when all is
[52:08] in all and finish standing in the future
[52:12] home all is made new everybody that
[52:17] would ever get eternal life is there
[52:22] so maybe outside the city if someone be
[52:25] do this
[52:25] that's alright they can be a day and
[52:28] night there that's alright
[52:30] but no that's what I want to get to now
[52:33] not in the city
[52:37] not in this city
[52:43] he said well candidly if it's day and
[52:46] night that's dark no oh you're not
[52:47] listening you think you got it
[52:51] but you're missing it what was the first
[52:57] thing God created we covered this a
[53:04] little bit last night I told you I was
[53:07] gonna get on it today
[53:11] what is the first creation okay I got
[53:16] the quotes in here so don't worry about
[53:18] I'll give it to you the run said God is
[53:22] his first creation now God never had a
[53:27] beginning so get the idea out of your
[53:29] mind of something having a beginning
[53:38] but God started condescending right
[53:45] exactly right
[53:50] now remember now we're gonna read in a
[53:54] little bit that there's no need of the
[53:57] moon no need of the Sun right what
[54:11] when the prophets describing that God's
[54:15] first creation was God himself that's
[54:20] not talking about something that it
[54:22] didn't exist but come in to exist it's
[54:26] something that was existing but yet
[54:29] could not be comprehended and when it's
[54:36] brought out into the open because he God
[54:39] is a spirit Jesus was human flesh to
[54:43] come to do what come to make the father
[54:46] known what's the first creation of God
[54:51] God himself that's what your prophet
[54:53] I'll give it to it
[54:54] we just remember he's talking about God
[54:59] condescending he's not talking about a
[55:03] beginning because God had no beginning
[55:05] and remember he always was the word so
[55:12] now when I get down to the point of
[55:13] saying the word was first don't think
[55:16] that the word didn't exist with him
[55:19] before the world that's the scripture in
[55:22] the beginning was the word Word was with
[55:24] God and the Word was God
[55:26] what a run said in the beginning without
[55:28] him well ahem was with God and L ahem
[55:30] was God that don't forget now don't
[55:41] forget we're still talking about the all
[55:43] and all I'm just trying to express it in
[55:47] another way or you'll understand what it
[55:51] means now think about it first heaven
[56:00] for as Earth passed away all right
[56:14] let me see if I can
[56:19] okay I placed forward now let's jump
[56:23] over this five what is the first
[56:27] creation what did brother Brown say the
[56:31] first crease what he said gods first
[56:34] crazy all right now let's read it in
[56:37] another phone there's questions and
[56:40] answers a 1953
[56:42] okay look pull it on the doctor here
[56:47] they asked him what connection does
[56:50] Genesis 1:9 26 how to do Genesis 2 you
[56:53] know what he says he's explained one's a
[56:55] natural man the others a spiritual man
[56:57] now listen look what I said if you
[57:00] notice in creation the first thing that
[57:05] was created of course was light
[57:17] you come on down through the creation
[57:19] the last thing created was like a man
[57:22] what's God's first creation he said well
[57:26] it was himself that's light as I said
[57:32] don't get your mind tied up even you
[57:36] think creation you're thinking something
[57:38] that didn't exist and all at once it
[57:41] comes into existence that's not a new
[57:44] creation the first thing is like okay go
[57:58] ahead to number six then God said let
[58:05] there be light and there was light
[58:08] and God saw the light that it was good
[58:11] and God divided the light from the
[58:14] darkness and caused a lot day and the
[58:18] darkness he called night in the evening
[58:21] in the morning were the first day
[58:34] turnover number seven okay and God said
[58:42] let there be lights in the firmament of
[58:44] the heaven to divide the day from the
[58:46] night and let them be for signs and for
[58:49] seasons for days and years and let them
[58:52] be lights in the firmament of the heaven
[58:54] to give light upon the earth and it was
[58:57] so and God made two great lights the
[59:03] greater light to rule the day and the
[59:06] lesser light to rule the night and he
[59:10] made the stars also and God set them in
[59:13] the firmament of heaven to give light
[59:14] upon the earth and to rule over the day
[59:18] and over the night and divided the light
[59:22] from the darkness
[59:23] and God saw that was good and the
[59:25] evening in the morning were the fourth
[59:27] day what did he create on the first day
[59:36] do you automatically think he created
[59:39] the Sun in the moon when the first day
[59:41] he did do it he created the Sun in the
[59:44] moon in the fourth day we're reading
[59:47] Bible so what was that light then in
[59:57] verse one you know it says that in the
[59:59] beginning God created heaven terror and
[1:00:01] Erik was without form and void he doing
[1:00:05] no case if the earth was without form
[1:00:10] and void and darkness was upon the face
[1:00:13] of it now why does it say darkness
[1:00:28] darkness is an absence of light right so
[1:00:37] when God said let there be light was he
[1:00:39] creating the moon in the Sun no he was
[1:00:46] bringing forth light of understanding
[1:00:49] it's not that it was dark because the
[1:00:53] Bible said in him is no darkness who
[1:01:01] ever worked God ever existed there's no
[1:01:04] darkness so he said - let there be light
[1:01:11] and then words let light come forth in a
[1:01:18] manifestation like I told him life not
[1:01:22] you closes that room off totally black
[1:01:27] that's what you call darkness strike one
[1:01:31] match you put out the whole darkness
[1:01:35] this in the room right see it's
[1:01:41] expressing how that God is going to
[1:01:50] unveil himself to be seen there was
[1:01:57] never a time that God existed in
[1:02:00] darkness they can't be any darkness -
[1:02:03] God those God is light and in him is no
[1:02:07] darkness so it's exactly right the first
[1:02:16] thing was light now come on ain't gonna
[1:02:22] get to it normal not to go so far at all
[1:02:25] we just remember I said we were still on
[1:02:29] the all and it all remember I thought we
[1:02:37] could bad this Talde
[1:02:44] that the Bible says you're the light of
[1:02:46] the world did the Bible say that you are
[1:02:57] the light of the world so he didn't
[1:03:07] create light light always was God
[1:03:13] because God is light and in him there is
[1:03:16] no darkness it's not explaining
[1:03:21] differences well the dark world was
[1:03:23] without form and void and darkness was
[1:03:26] upon the face of the deep and you know
[1:03:28] it's not explaining a situation of a
[1:03:32] great darkness when all at once it
[1:03:36] starts coming for the light or what
[1:03:40] didn't he wait till the 4th day and use
[1:03:43] it with the Sun and the moon and in case
[1:03:46] you had never thought about it
[1:03:48] I thought we believed that the moon has
[1:03:51] no light it's only a reflection of the
[1:03:57] Sun right no matter where it is in the
[1:04:03] world it just keeps turning this
[1:04:04] reflection of the Sun so what are you
[1:04:07] trying to get out I'm trying to get to a
[1:04:09] point to understand the all-in-all
[1:04:16] trying to get to a point to understand
[1:04:19] where brother Branham says God is not
[1:04:22] complete without you you realize if you
[1:04:31] take out that light that you have all we
[1:04:35] used to sing that song you know we live
[1:04:37] kids done it and the Baptist we live
[1:04:39] gets done it in the Methodist
[1:04:41] Presbyterian this little light of mine
[1:04:43] I'm gonna let it shine
[1:04:50] what light was we talking about are
[1:04:54] supposed to been talking about see then
[1:05:02] when the Prophet says that God's first
[1:05:04] creation was himself he didn't create
[1:05:08] something to come into light he didn't
[1:05:10] make like he always existed his light in
[1:05:16] him as the light and there's no darkness
[1:05:19] he didn't have to come into a being it
[1:05:22] wasn't dark and it automatically made
[1:05:24] light it's a it's the technical point
[1:05:27] showing you because why didn't he wait
[1:05:29] to the fourth day and let the Sun handle
[1:05:32] it because he that Sun was a different
[1:05:37] light the Sun was a creation of light
[1:05:43] all right are you in the the Sun was a
[1:05:46] creation of light light was not a
[1:05:50] creation light was Almighty God see we
[1:05:59] used to talk about it the badness right
[1:06:01] well yet that were the light of the
[1:06:05] world let your light shine
[1:06:08] don't put it under a bushel don't put it
[1:06:10] over let your light shine go you're the
[1:06:13] light no see we believe God was like we
[1:06:18] didn't believe where's the light we
[1:06:20] believe God was like but we didn't
[1:06:23] accept the fact that we were like but
[1:06:26] only way we could be light was have
[1:06:28] mercy have him in us Jesus was
[1:06:32] describing the new birth or the
[1:06:34] scripture was it brings us to the same
[1:06:38] light that he is and we don't need to
[1:06:40] moon to the Sun
[1:06:50] one day the moon in the Sun won't have
[1:06:53] to exist for you and me
[1:06:56] there'll be no light I'm getting this
[1:07:00] point then we'll just drop it by
[1:07:02] there'll be no need of the moon and the
[1:07:05] stars or the Sun in the city maybe
[1:07:10] outside yeah you can all day or night
[1:07:14] you can have all in thought but if you
[1:07:16] have day and night is the darkness going
[1:07:19] to be now let me say something to you
[1:07:23] listen the Sun is to make the day right
[1:07:30] the moon is to make the night then moon
[1:07:34] reflects the light of the Sun so it will
[1:07:39] never be dark again well because the
[1:07:50] moon is shining now let's don't get into
[1:07:53] technical points the Rose lives up here
[1:07:55] of this light dark in that light just
[1:07:58] listen see that's what you do you say
[1:08:01] something you don't understand the roar
[1:08:04] and I said what does that word for it
[1:08:06] where's never darting or not you know
[1:08:08] stay the same I'll wait don't get into
[1:08:12] silliness listen to what's being said as
[1:08:16] long as the moon is in existence
[1:08:19] reflecting the light of the Sun that
[1:08:21] will never be a darkness upon the earth
[1:08:28] yeah but clouds get that's what I'm
[1:08:30] selling you see you've got it all
[1:08:32] figured out
[1:08:33] you ever taste darkness comes across
[1:08:36] them this is when the darkness comes
[1:08:38] across when you have an eclipse and the
[1:08:44] coast totally dark does that put out the
[1:08:46] Sun okay there we're sitting there and
[1:08:49] this this is gonna come okay and God
[1:08:52] just goes click what a switch and he
[1:08:54] turns off the Sun so you're not you're
[1:09:01] not thinking in
[1:09:03] so matters you're thinking with a human
[1:09:05] mind of capacity to try to understand
[1:09:09] you're trying to make an answer but just
[1:09:15] remember once that Sun was created it
[1:09:19] will never stop shining once the moon
[1:09:26] was brought into existence to relate the
[1:09:28] light reflect the light of the Sun it
[1:09:31] will never stop so you can have new
[1:09:35] moons and all kind of thing outside the
[1:09:37] city but I'm talking about in the city
[1:09:41] there's no need of the light right what
[1:09:49] is it
[1:09:49] no license six and it ain't six six and
[1:09:54] eleven is that worth that the old minute
[1:10:08] just not that you know what is it come
[1:10:16] see the lamb I'll get back to it because
[1:10:18] I want to pick it up later anyway the
[1:10:22] lamb is the light of the city
[1:10:26] now does his gut light go out you know
[1:10:31] when he walks outside the city then
[1:10:37] you're the light does your light go out
[1:10:39] and you walk in darkness you say yeah
[1:10:46] but you you sound like you're talking
[1:10:48] about we're gonna be a lightning bubs
[1:10:52] you know lightning Burt what did it you
[1:10:54] know where the flick at nights you don't
[1:10:57] lightning bugs ain't talking stupid I'm
[1:11:03] talking spiritual when the Bible says
[1:11:07] you're the light of the world it's not
[1:11:11] talking about you're going to be glowing
[1:11:13] oh I can just see it bright they saw me
[1:11:16] down there one day and they saw a lot
[1:11:18] all the way around I was just glowing
[1:11:20] they may be true but that ain't what I'm
[1:11:24] talking about I'm talking about God is
[1:11:28] light there never was a time that he was
[1:11:32] in darkness there was no darkness
[1:11:39] darkness is an absence of light show me
[1:11:44] word could ever be dark well you don't
[1:11:47] sound like you believe in the dark nor
[1:11:48] not anymore no cuz that come on over the
[1:11:51] fourth day when he started needing it
[1:11:54] the first day he created light in other
[1:11:58] words God brought himself from us not
[1:12:02] being able to see him or comprehending
[1:12:05] him and understanding anyway he brought
[1:12:08] light the light is the one that said let
[1:12:11] there be not to sign it come on up with
[1:12:18] our four days three or four days later
[1:12:20] well I never thought about
[1:12:22] I thought that first creation was the
[1:12:25] moon and stars and the Sun that he what
[1:12:27] the Bible says the Bible says four days
[1:12:34] later finally come the Sun and the moon
[1:12:37] the gods first creation was himself
[1:12:45] condescending down it out of a total
[1:12:49] existence of the purities of all light
[1:12:53] that could ever be comprehended with a
[1:12:55] mortal mind God would begin to step down
[1:12:59] and he would know that there was going
[1:13:02] to be a day and a night there was no day
[1:13:09] in not in the eternal heavens where God
[1:13:12] existed alone as the self existing one
[1:13:20] there was no night and day night and day
[1:13:25] begin to develop into existence into the
[1:13:29] fourth day when he created the Sun the
[1:13:32] rule over the day he was bringing it in
[1:13:35] to physical manifestation God is light
[1:13:42] and in him there is no darkness you're
[1:13:45] the light of the world you realize what
[1:13:51] sort of trouble to take play like wait
[1:13:53] talking about the tribulation and the
[1:13:55] thing you realize why it's gonna come
[1:13:57] tribulation there's a wrath of God
[1:13:59] poured out on the earth you realize the
[1:14:01] reason it's poured out why cuz all the
[1:14:04] light's gone ever born again believer
[1:14:10] leaves for the tribulation takes blood
[1:14:16] though then it can go into darkness but
[1:14:19] it won't go into darkness because the
[1:14:20] moon will still be that the Sun would
[1:14:22] still be shining right so in his
[1:14:26] creation he had to create and not to be
[1:14:30] a creation like this piece of paper that
[1:14:33] was once a tree or something like that
[1:14:36] but it was changed and brought down and
[1:14:39] finally made to paper there is no
[1:14:43] darkness to God I love the way the
[1:14:48] Prophet explains it go take it take the
[1:14:50] words in your your meaning of it says
[1:14:53] he's the Alpha and Omega the beginning
[1:14:59] in the end he's the root and offering
[1:15:03] he's everything who is he he's light and
[1:15:09] in him is no darkness but he didn't have
[1:15:13] to create something
[1:15:17] it was the higher before anything ever
[1:15:22] existed God dwelt alone right you see
[1:15:29] we're not listening to all the things
[1:15:30] the prophets say it we're listening to
[1:15:34] what we want to them and say well see
[1:15:36] there there was a time that he was
[1:15:37] self-existing could he self existed this
[1:15:42] if I sell you see we failed to read the
[1:15:46] rest of it then he dwelt alone with his
[1:15:51] attributes right he dwelt along with his
[1:16:01] attributes so you gonna find out one day
[1:16:06] that all we're doing is going back where
[1:16:09] we come from in the word redeem we got
[1:16:16] to go through a process to go back to
[1:16:19] where we come from well you believe in
[1:16:23] pre existence
[1:16:23] I believe in pre existence of Almighty
[1:16:26] God I don't believe in pre existence of
[1:16:31] humanity I believe in pre existence of
[1:16:36] that eternal life that you have in you
[1:16:38] called a new birth because that was part
[1:16:42] of God before the world ever begun that
[1:16:44] was his attribute before the world ever
[1:16:46] started was that eternal out that you
[1:16:49] have
[1:16:49] you now I'll go with you when you say
[1:16:51] always was eternal because you certainly
[1:16:55] tell them about this you're talking
[1:16:59] about what's inside of you by the new
[1:17:01] birth then he had been part eternal life
[1:17:12] so what's God's first great light light
[1:17:20] three days later he creates the Sun in
[1:17:23] the moon what does he need them far for
[1:17:28] the whole world you didn't need it for
[1:17:33] where he's at
[1:17:42] you realize when he when he stepped into
[1:17:44] humanity he felt something he'd never
[1:17:47] felt because when the Sun Goes Down at
[1:17:51] night he couldn't see no better nobody
[1:17:54] else he felt something that he never
[1:17:58] felt because that light was not that
[1:18:03] flesh the light I'm talking about from
[1:18:09] the beginning is that one that dwelt in
[1:18:11] the flesh that if you receive the new
[1:18:17] birth then you're the light of the world
[1:18:24] by the born-again experience the light
[1:18:27] that God existed along with and was
[1:18:30] always and there were no darkness lives
[1:18:33] with inside of you if it lives inside of
[1:18:38] you you are the light of the world
[1:18:42] there's no need of the light in the
[1:18:46] future home they'll never be a day or
[1:18:54] not in the future home that's what your
[1:18:57] prophet said read it future home it will
[1:18:59] be no darkness dark now outside yes
[1:19:06] because that's the world and everything
[1:19:08] else but just remember one thing what if
[1:19:14] he had not of created the moon in the
[1:19:16] Stars you would have a lot in the city
[1:19:20] in the world would be now the world
[1:19:22] outside is going to exist under the
[1:19:25] situation we exist under now days and
[1:19:28] nights but just remember my illustration
[1:19:35] no matter how dark it gets the light is
[1:19:40] still reflecting from the moon you're
[1:19:44] putting clouds up and smoke or or stuff
[1:19:48] up above to cut off the ain't on my dad
[1:19:53] you know better than that that's just
[1:19:56] your terminologies of trying to say how
[1:19:58] smart you are
[1:20:01] well I figured that out Brazil didn't
[1:20:03] figure that out ain't have to figure
[1:20:06] that out it's the plain truth they'll
[1:20:08] never be a time that there never will be
[1:20:09] a darkness because even in the in the
[1:20:19] new earth it will never go back to a
[1:20:23] total darkness they will be a moon and a
[1:20:26] sun shining outside the city but inside
[1:20:34] the city you don't need no light you
[1:20:37] don't need no temple you don't need
[1:20:40] anything cuz the lamb is the light I
[1:20:48] thought we believe what the Bible says
[1:20:51] God is light and in him is no darkness
[1:20:55] it's not stopped not something that
[1:20:58] didn't exist and then it come into
[1:21:00] existence I ain't talkin about something
[1:21:02] like that
[1:21:04] God always was like he's the only life
[1:21:09] he didn't have a time that he started a
[1:21:12] flesh yes that's what's called the
[1:21:16] beginning of the creation of God
[1:21:17] revelation 3:14 and retirin said wind it
[1:21:20] out of God Christ he said only in Jesus
[1:21:23] Christ is God of creation it wasn't that
[1:21:29] God come into being
[1:21:31] no God came into eyesight or a
[1:21:35] manifestation the word he could be
[1:21:39] understood and then one day he gave you
[1:21:45] the new birth putting that same light
[1:21:47] inside of you the same light he had is
[1:21:53] inside of you what does that make you
[1:21:58] remember the story still is all in all
[1:22:05] remember the point is still all in all
[1:22:10] the light has shined upon God's Word to
[1:22:18] reveal God to mankind the best you can
[1:22:26] do you take self-existing and when you
[1:22:31] take self-existing be careful because
[1:22:34] you just took yourself out of being if
[1:22:36] you don't understand how to do that if
[1:22:40] he's self existing and he existed alone
[1:22:43] then where were we before the world we
[1:22:49] better believe we were in him as part of
[1:22:51] God a part of eternal life living in God
[1:22:56] and attribute a thought and he said let
[1:23:03] there be and we come into existence he
[1:23:09] had no one to create him he was the
[1:23:13] creator he had nobody to turn a light
[1:23:15] switch and make it light to where you
[1:23:18] could see he was the light he doesn't
[1:23:21] need that there'll be no need of none of
[1:23:23] that in the city because in the city
[1:23:27] will be total light no matter what it is
[1:23:30] outside day or night URI time come on
[1:23:35] kids
[1:23:37] Jonah Thomas back there he he likes a
[1:23:42] nightlight in his bedroom right what
[1:23:49] about the kids you want to not lot how
[1:23:50] many grown-ups got night lights you got
[1:23:53] a note I see some lands right now better
[1:23:54] over there
[1:23:55] some of you grown-ups need a nightlight
[1:23:58] but what about a time when you don't
[1:24:01] need no light at all but just remember
[1:24:06] as I said while ago when he walks out of
[1:24:09] that city he don't turn the light speech
[1:24:14] never where he's at it always will be
[1:24:17] light but just remember
[1:24:19] if you're born again believer then
[1:24:23] there's no darkness in you then
[1:24:27] everywhere you go is a lot we used to
[1:24:30] sing it this little out of mind I'll let
[1:24:31] it snow what are we talking about doing
[1:24:33] let it's time to others that they may
[1:24:35] see put it under a bushel no we don't
[1:24:40] want to cover it up we want to let it be
[1:24:41] seen because we're the light you see why
[1:24:51] he's not complete without you could you
[1:24:56] visualize for a second 10 billion little
[1:24:59] light bulbs and all that would be
[1:25:01] representing God and all at once one of
[1:25:04] them goes out and show up this Purdy's
[1:25:07] kabir wouldn't that ain't the way God is
[1:25:12] right they said I had plenty of time
[1:25:17] this morning because of Lisa Tim's going
[1:25:19] after the food no what about it what do
[1:25:24] you think about light if I got a
[1:25:27] question what do you think about light
[1:25:30] light had no beginning the moon and the
[1:25:37] stars did so that's not the light you're
[1:25:39] talking about if God lives in you that
[1:25:48] light is in you there's no need of the
[1:25:55] light you don't have to have a lot in
[1:25:59] this city but you didn't listen to what
[1:26:06] I was saying on the other this two men
[1:26:10] show you how carnal you can get you say
[1:26:12] well the clouds come over and with
[1:26:14] darkness just remember in the future
[1:26:16] home
[1:26:17] there'll be no clouds there will be no
[1:26:20] mushrooms going up there'll be no no fog
[1:26:23] there'll be no more deaths out of the
[1:26:25] other it'd all be new will be no
[1:26:30] volcanoes erupting and covering the
[1:26:32] earth with ice
[1:26:34] they'll all be made new thing will be no
[1:26:38] darkness in the world no matter what not
[1:26:41] becomes it with his dire when the
[1:26:44] Prophet is describing the future home
[1:26:46] and he said now outside of the city that
[1:26:50] inside the city
[1:26:51] you know how no need of the light he
[1:26:54] said that outside the city you'll have
[1:26:56] your stars your moon and but just
[1:26:59] remember the day he created that natural
[1:27:03] Sun from that day till now it ain't
[1:27:05] stopped glowing I ain't gonna stop
[1:27:10] glowing when we get there it'll keep
[1:27:14] glowing because there'll never be a
[1:27:16] darkness as one match in a you know ten
[1:27:21] thousand foot building totally dark and
[1:27:25] one match lit it puts out all that
[1:27:29] darkness same thing would be if a
[1:27:33] born-again believer everywhere you walk
[1:27:36] there's light you're the light you
[1:27:44] realize what that makes us a part of God
[1:27:52] right if he's like then we're part of
[1:27:56] God see what the world's looking at you
[1:28:00] for they wanting to see Jesus right
[1:28:07] what if we're not letting our light
[1:28:09] shine then we're creating darkness but
[1:28:17] don't forget this light is not a
[1:28:21] creation
[1:28:27] life is God God never had a beginning to
[1:28:36] condescend Awards earth that we could
[1:28:38] see him a human flesh yes are the
[1:28:41] manifestations of different ways of
[1:28:42] seeing through son of man son of God son
[1:28:45] of David all of that but just remember
[1:28:47] each one of those son of God listening
[1:28:51] we're still on it son of man son of God
[1:28:55] son of David each one of them is related
[1:28:57] to your Redemption you're not something
[1:29:05] that needs to be sitting on the throne
[1:29:07] in the Millennium that's the throne of
[1:29:13] David it won't be David sitting there it
[1:29:17] be the Lord Jesus that night why don't
[1:29:21] you put David up dark wrong man David
[1:29:26] ain't got enough light he sits on that
[1:29:31] throne you realize we'll be right there
[1:29:34] with him take out one of those lives
[1:29:44] that aggravates me to look at a thing
