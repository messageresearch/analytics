[11:58] read from from james chapter one james
[12:01] chapter one
[12:05] and
[12:06] i want to talk tonight just a little
[12:08] topic a little a little bit different
[12:10] amen
[12:11] from all the from all the teaching we
[12:13] received and all the the deepness that
[12:15] we received on sunday available a little
[12:17] bit something that kind of loosened us
[12:19] up a little bit and hopefully it'll help
[12:21] us amen amen but i want to talk tonight
[12:23] about under pressure
[12:25] under pressure and i'm not talking about
[12:27] the song either
[12:29] there was a song in the 80s called
[12:31] undepression that's not that's not what
[12:33] but
[12:33] [Laughter]
[12:35] don't look at me that way
[12:38] but we want to talk about how many how
[12:40] many are felt being under pressure how
[12:43] many felt pressured today
[12:47] each and every one of us no matter what
[12:48] age we we are we are or how old we are
[12:52] or how young we are we
[12:54] we have felt or are feeling some form of
[12:57] pressure
[12:58] amen
[12:59] and and it's it's part of life
[13:02] there's nothing wrong with it
[13:04] it's just how you handle it and how you
[13:06] respond to it is is is what is what we
[13:09] need to look at so um
[13:12] pressure is good we need we all need to
[13:14] have pressure and we'll we'll get into
[13:15] that for in just a moment but let's just
[13:18] read here in james chapter 1 and i don't
[13:19] want to keep you standing too long it
[13:21] says here in verse 2 my brethren counted
[13:24] all joy when ye fall into divers
[13:26] temptations
[13:27] knowing this that the trying of your
[13:29] faith worketh patience but let patience
[13:32] have her perfect work that ye may be
[13:34] perfect and entire
[13:36] wanting nothing
[13:38] if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of
[13:40] god that giveth to all man liberally
[13:44] liberally in other words that he just
[13:46] freely
[13:47] amen
[13:48] and upbraideth not and it shall be given
[13:51] him
[13:52] but let him ask in faith
[13:54] nothing wavering for he that wavereth or
[13:58] is unstable it's like a wave of the sea
[14:01] that is driven with the wind and tossed
[14:04] and it just goes
[14:06] every every way
[14:09] for let not that man think that he shall
[14:11] receive anything of the lord
[14:14] if if he's if he's asking wavering
[14:17] a double-minded man is unstable in all
[14:20] his ways don't you hate that you know
[14:22] sometimes you you ask a person and like
[14:24] hey what you want to do well i don't
[14:26] know what you want to do
[14:28] i don't know what you want to do
[14:30] well let's go here that's fine uh well
[14:34] maybe we should go here well you just
[14:36] said that's fine no well no you know and
[14:38] you're like oh my goodness
[14:39] [Music]
[14:41] a double-minded man you just kind of you
[14:43] kind of you hate that right
[14:45] and god hates it too
[14:47] see if you hate it in the flesh how much
[14:49] more god
[14:50] a man that's not stable a person that is
[14:54] not stable in the in the word
[14:56] that is not stable in what you have
[14:58] believed
[14:59] and you continue to go back to your dead
[15:02] works thinking that that's what's going
[15:04] to save you
[15:06] knowing that and you go back to the sins
[15:08] that you may did 10 years ago 15 years
[15:11] ago lord i'm sorry
[15:12] amen god doesn't like that if it's under
[15:15] the blood it's under the blood
[15:17] if it's
[15:18] there is now no condemnation to them
[15:20] that are in christ jesus
[15:22] the question is and the problem is is
[15:25] that maybe you have not connected to
[15:27] christ you're not in christ jesus and
[15:29] that's why you keep wavering back and
[15:31] forth
[15:32] amen praise god so a double-minded man
[15:34] is unstable in all his ways let the
[15:37] brother of low degree rejoice in that he
[15:39] is exalted but the rich in that he is
[15:42] made low because as the flower of the
[15:45] grass he shall pass away
[15:47] for the sun is no sooner risen with a
[15:49] burning heat but it where
[15:52] but it withereth the grass and the
[15:54] flower thereof falleth and the grace of
[15:57] the fashion of it perisheth so also
[15:59] shall the rich man fade away in his ways
[16:03] especially if he doesn't have god
[16:06] blessed is the man that endureth
[16:07] temptation
[16:09] for when he is tried
[16:11] he shall receive the crown of life i
[16:13] like that james says
[16:15] that
[16:16] it's not that you're not going to go
[16:18] through temptation
[16:19] james doesn't say that james knows that
[16:23] the believer and the christian is going
[16:24] to go through temptation but blessed is
[16:27] the man that endureth temptation
[16:29] for when he is tried he shall receive
[16:32] the crown of life
[16:33] which the lord hath promised to them
[16:36] that love him now do you love him
[16:38] amen praise the lord you may be seated
[16:40] this afternoon
[16:42] amen so
[16:45] under pressure this afternoon and
[16:48] i'll uh that just looking at that clock
[16:51] puts me under pressure
[16:55] yeah because i mean you know this time
[16:58] is is a pressure element
[16:59] and we re we know that even in the
[17:01] beginning there was no there was no time
[17:04] it wasn't until sin came in the picture
[17:06] that time came in the picture which
[17:08] means pressures came in the picture
[17:10] right
[17:11] we are growing up in life we have
[17:13] pressure as we're growing up and and we
[17:16] got stages that we're growing up you
[17:17] know a little a five-year-old maybe all
[17:20] they're worrying about is what they're
[17:21] gonna eat tomorrow you know or what
[17:22] they're gonna have for for dinner
[17:24] tonight or if they're gonna go to
[17:25] cookout and have a milkshake after after
[17:28] service tonight or not uh
[17:30] you know that that's the pressures that
[17:31] they're having but then you get a 15
[17:34] year old you know the pressure that they
[17:35] have now i just started 9th grade high
[17:37] school or 10th grade and the pressures
[17:40] of my goodness this is a brand new
[17:42] school oh this is a
[17:44] i don't have any friends all the friends
[17:46] i had in middle school uh they're not
[17:48] gonna be there at that new school and
[17:50] and there's that pressure that you have
[17:52] you know as a 15 year old the 25 year
[17:54] old doesn't have the pressures that a 15
[17:56] year will have because here the
[17:58] pressures have been elevated now i mean
[18:00] now they're thinking about what am i
[18:01] going to do with my life now
[18:03] i've gone maybe through a few years of
[18:05] college now and i may be thinking about
[18:07] getting married or i am i'm just a
[18:10] newlywed now and now you got the
[18:12] pressures of of of of trying to be a
[18:15] husband or trying to and and some have
[18:18] even been fathers at that young age you
[18:20] know i got married when i was 25 years
[18:22] old uh
[18:23] didn't have we didn't have bella until i
[18:25] was 26 27 i think yeah 26 something like
[18:28] that but but
[18:31] all that pressure came on me all almost
[18:33] all at the same time
[18:35] bella came on the scene about uh
[18:38] what
[18:39] 10 months after we got married
[18:43] or or more a year or more
[18:45] but
[18:46] it was that pressure you know marriage
[18:49] and then here comes the children you see
[18:51] and and there's that pressure now i'm
[18:53] not saying that's anything wrong that
[18:55] i'm just saying
[18:57] don't take that in the wrong way
[18:59] it was just it was just it was just bam
[19:01] there it is you see it wasn't the same
[19:03] pressures that i had when i was 15 years
[19:05] old
[19:06] when i was at papa john's just spinning
[19:08] pizza you know oh man everything was
[19:10] hunky dory you know i mean oh man it was
[19:12] it was fun
[19:14] now i got different pressures
[19:15] and now the pressures that i had at 25
[19:17] years old is not the pressures that i
[19:19] have now at 41.
[19:21] now i have other pressures now
[19:23] on top of that you culminate the
[19:24] pressures that you get from life you
[19:26] know in the world systems now and and
[19:29] and the way and even in in this last
[19:31] year we've all gone through all kinds of
[19:33] pressures
[19:34] i don't think we we we
[19:36] we considered and we realized the type
[19:39] of pressures that we were going to be in
[19:41] in 2021
[19:42] even at 2020
[19:44] now we see all kinds of pressures put on
[19:46] us
[19:47] that we never realized that we would
[19:48] have amen but it's pressures it's
[19:51] pressures right you know the bible uh
[19:53] the the word pressure
[19:55] it means this it's a it means if the
[19:57] brothers can put this definition up i
[19:59] think i gave it to him yes it's a
[20:01] continuous physical force exerted on or
[20:04] against an object by something in
[20:07] contact with it
[20:09] amen
[20:10] definition number two it says the use of
[20:13] persuasion influence or intimidation to
[20:16] make someone do something
[20:19] and you know i was i was uh the other
[20:21] day i was at racetrack on monday and we
[20:23] were we were going to have we were
[20:25] i was going to go to central office at a
[20:27] board meeting
[20:28] and i had a
[20:30] i was going to buy some food i had some
[20:31] coffee that i had gotten and i was at
[20:33] the line you know waiting you know i had
[20:36] this this stuff because i was that was
[20:37] my lunch actually it was around 2 p.m
[20:39] two through 3 p.m
[20:41] and i'm just looking around and you know
[20:42] you're looking around and everything is
[20:44] just kind of uh there are all kinds of
[20:46] signs
[20:47] grabbing your attention you know get
[20:48] grab me get this get this and
[20:51] i'm sitting there in the sun you know i
[20:53] think i have enough and i look over at
[20:55] the krispy kreme little little booth
[20:57] there
[20:59] and they had it had a it had to say a
[21:01] thing that said on there it says
[21:03] you deserve one
[21:06] actually you deserve two yeah right too
[21:12] i was actually getting ready to just hey
[21:14] can you hold this for just a moment let
[21:15] me grab two
[21:18] because that's how that's how persuasive
[21:21] and how pressured you know they they
[21:23] that the advertising is you know
[21:26] i mean you know who's not thinking that
[21:28] they deserve hey i just had a rough day
[21:30] i deserve two maybe three
[21:32] [Laughter]
[21:35] who doesn't think that you know and and
[21:37] and isn't that how how satan does to us
[21:40] as christians you know you deserve that
[21:43] sure just let off some steam you know
[21:45] you've been you've had it's been rough
[21:48] you know it's it it's been rough and and
[21:50] and you know you deserve that time right
[21:52] there and you're in front of the
[21:54] computer and god and he's tempting you
[21:56] to do who knows what amen you deserve
[21:59] that time
[22:01] and then you find yourself in guilt
[22:05] condemnation
[22:06] why in the world
[22:08] it's a pressure it's a temptation of
[22:10] depression you see
[22:13] three an attempt to persuade or coerce
[22:16] someone into doing something amen that's
[22:18] a pressure yeah amen and we they're
[22:21] definitely seeing that a lot today
[22:23] amen
[22:24] so pressure is is as i said earlier
[22:28] pressure is a necessary uh thing it's
[22:30] not just
[22:31] it's a survival mechanism for but but
[22:33] but also to live
[22:35] for also to live a christian life
[22:37] amen you need certain amounts of
[22:40] pressure in your life amen
[22:42] for example if we're a piano when it's
[22:45] being tuned
[22:47] it's got to have certain pressure put on
[22:49] the strings
[22:51] and if you don't give it that certain
[22:52] pressure i mean because of the of the
[22:54] temperature in here the the hot and the
[22:56] cold it makes the the strings a man
[22:59] condensed and and and and
[23:01] you know get get wide and and condensed
[23:04] and things like that so you need that
[23:05] pressure that piano tuner needs that
[23:07] pressure to put that pressure under to
[23:09] make that piano sound good again same
[23:11] thing with a guitar and you can say the
[23:12] same thing with the violin there's got
[23:14] to be a certain pressures put on these
[23:16] instruments in order to make them sound
[23:18] good
[23:19] see if you just leave the the guitar
[23:21] just like that you see
[23:24] and never and never do anything to it
[23:28] it'll it'll it'll be out of tune it will
[23:31] never sound good
[23:32] you see you have to apply certain
[23:35] pressures right here with this pad these
[23:36] pegs
[23:38] right and when you apply certain the
[23:40] certain pressures and and and the and
[23:42] the the one that's that plays the
[23:44] instrument he he's making sure he's
[23:46] looking uh okay i've applied certain pre
[23:49] i like the way that sounds now yes that
[23:52] sounds just right you see right but he
[23:53] had to apply certain pressures you see
[23:56] and don't think that you can live your
[23:57] life amen
[23:59] your christian life with with no
[24:01] pressures at all
[24:02] because whoever told you that when you
[24:04] become a christian and you're never
[24:06] going to have a problem in your life
[24:08] sold you a bill of goods and and is
[24:10] probably trying to put something on you
[24:12] amen
[24:13] amen
[24:14] because that's not how it is jesus said
[24:17] if you don't take up your cross and
[24:19] follow me
[24:20] you have no part in me
[24:22] you've got to take up the cross and
[24:24] we're talking about his cross amen was a
[24:27] cross of made of wood it was heavy
[24:29] right if we're looking at the physical
[24:30] cross right he was talking spiritually
[24:32] but if we're looking at his physical
[24:34] cross it was a heavy cross
[24:37] but you see when you're carrying his
[24:39] cross it actually becomes light
[24:42] because he says you take my burden my
[24:44] burden is light amen so it's not it's
[24:47] not a push and pull thing now to serve
[24:50] god it's you want to take up the cross
[24:54] you want to do it lord it doesn't matter
[24:56] what what i need what needs to happen i
[24:59] want to take up the cross but because
[25:02] you put the want to in me
[25:04] when you don't want to it becomes a
[25:06] burden
[25:07] i've got to go to church i i've got to
[25:11] i've got to
[25:13] sing songs i've got i've i've got to him
[25:16] when you have to come over then it
[25:18] becomes a burden
[25:20] but when god puts that want in you amen
[25:24] things become lighter you see
[25:26] things things become lighter doesn't
[25:28] mean it's easier
[25:29] but it just becomes lighter amen praise
[25:32] god
[25:33] we see also a woman when she's having a
[25:35] baby you know she she's under pressure
[25:39] those of you mothers here who've had
[25:41] children you understand that when you're
[25:43] carrying a child when you're carrying
[25:45] life there comes a point after the eight
[25:48] and nine months amen that that baby
[25:50] starts putting that pressure
[25:52] i'm getting ready to come out
[25:54] you ready or not
[25:56] uh here i come
[25:58] it's time here i come and you start
[26:00] feeling that pressure and and even
[26:02] though she's crying she's weeping and
[26:05] and she might be screaming and telling
[26:07] them get me drugs do something
[26:12] that that baby's coming out that's right
[26:15] that baby's coming out is that pressure
[26:18] but then once all that dissipates once
[26:20] the baby comes
[26:21] you're not even thinking about the
[26:22] pressure anymore you're thinking about
[26:24] that life on you hey man that baby now
[26:27] you know how she how how you have her on
[26:30] her chest now you're not even thinking
[26:31] the pressure that you have you see amen
[26:33] when
[26:34] when when when you've gone through a
[26:36] trial in your life and and and it was
[26:39] hard it was difficult amen but when you
[26:40] get to the other side of it amen you
[26:42] don't even think about the details of
[26:44] the things that took that you went
[26:45] through amen you're just rejoicing and
[26:47] you're you're praising god for the for
[26:50] the outcome amen praise god you're not
[26:53] you're and then maybe you can sit back
[26:55] and relax after you're praising god you
[26:57] can sit back and relax lord you brought
[26:59] me through that
[27:00] right amen oh my amen what an awesome
[27:03] god we serve
[27:05] and he said yes i brought you through
[27:06] that and it out actually wants to it
[27:08] makes you want to praise him even more
[27:11] amen
[27:13] through many tolls
[27:14] and dangers he's brought us through amen
[27:17] praise god
[27:19] sometimes you know in life we have
[27:21] pressures amen that we
[27:23] that that that we bottle up inside amen
[27:27] uh that we if we if
[27:30] we couple with with the with
[27:32] we have this pressure and then we couple
[27:34] it with the with the pressure of not
[27:36] showing it
[27:37] that's right
[27:38] that actually creates even more pressure
[27:41] you see it's a false it's a
[27:44] and then you're putting you're you're
[27:45] putting a false image before people a
[27:48] man you know you got this pressure
[27:50] inside of you and but you don't want to
[27:52] show it because you don't want to make
[27:54] maybe your mom and dad look bad or or
[27:57] the church look bad you see you don't
[27:59] want to show it but in any moment amen
[28:01] somebody says the wrong thing to you
[28:03] it comes out
[28:05] somebody does something to you that you
[28:06] know
[28:08] it comes out
[28:09] because why it's bottled up pressure
[28:12] from maybe things that have happened in
[28:14] your life that have never got taken care
[28:17] of or never got resolved bottled up
[28:19] pressures amen and then couple it with
[28:22] the pressure of i can't show it right
[28:25] that's that's a that's a lot of pressure
[28:27] amen
[28:29] how many how many have uh uh
[28:31] since i and since 2007 i believe
[28:35] brother donna you might know this they
[28:37] started making the vehicles where they
[28:39] have the tpm the tire pressure uh
[28:42] monitor
[28:44] and it's just a little computer thing
[28:46] where it monitors the pressure of the
[28:48] tires as you're riding
[28:50] and uh it'll tell you if it's undeflated
[28:52] if the tires are under flat or if
[28:54] they're over inflated now do you know
[28:58] that because sometimes we think that a
[29:00] tire will bust or you know
[29:03] will will blow up if you put too much
[29:06] pressure in it right and that is true
[29:08] right but do you also know that if you
[29:12] have a tire that's under pressure
[29:15] that it will also cause a blow up
[29:19] and actually the blow up happens from
[29:21] the inside out
[29:23] right
[29:24] but donnie's agreeing with me it happens
[29:26] from the inside out
[29:29] right and then all the grinding of the
[29:31] tire and then you if you look inside the
[29:33] tire i was actually watching a little
[29:34] video about then when you look inside
[29:36] the tires just a bunch of the tire you
[29:38] know just grind it up inside and there's
[29:40] it causes a blow up so
[29:42] too much pressure causes a blow up
[29:44] under pressure causes a blow up as well
[29:47] you've got to have the right level in
[29:49] your life see god that's why i'm saying
[29:51] jesus did not say
[29:53] you become a christian and everything is
[29:55] going to be hunky-dory you've got to
[29:57] have the right level of pressure in your
[29:59] life so it's it's healthy to have
[30:01] pressures
[30:02] it's healthy to have pressure amen it's
[30:04] not a bad thing
[30:06] it's not a bad thing so but it's good
[30:08] it's good that we
[30:11] when we have that pressure amen in our
[30:13] lives that bottled up pressure amen that
[30:15] we find some way to release that amen a
[30:18] healthy way to release that
[30:20] amen not just any old way
[30:22] a healthy way
[30:24] amen
[30:25] look what brother branham says here in
[30:26] this message show us the father and it
[30:28] will satisfy us he says i said sure if
[30:31] they want me he was talking to somebody
[30:33] about the pentecostal church because
[30:34] they were you know they were uh they
[30:36] were saying i can't i don't understand
[30:38] why those pentecostals they're just
[30:39] jumping and shouting and screaming and
[30:41] all that stuff you know and brother
[30:43] brown says here sure they won't make the
[30:44] wheel roll right they've got to blow it
[30:46] out the whistle somewhere they've got a
[30:48] lot of steam i said and that's the truth
[30:51] if this pentecostal church would take a
[30:53] lot of its praises and put it to work it
[30:56] would do something for the kingdom of
[30:57] god
[30:59] all right god give you the holy ghost
[31:00] you like to shout by it and praise by it
[31:03] but just put that into grips and wonders
[31:06] and go out on the street and get sinners
[31:08] to come in and things like that
[31:11] your church will grow and everything
[31:12] will go along all right
[31:14] don't blow it out the whistle
[31:16] put it into action and let make the
[31:18] wheel roll the gospel train
[31:21] amen put put it into action you
[31:24] you know we we
[31:26] we got we got to let it out amen but but
[31:28] put it into something good am i right
[31:30] amen put it into action something that
[31:32] will will benefit you will benefit
[31:34] others and will glorify god amen praise
[31:37] god just because you're stressed or or
[31:39] just because uh uh you feel uh
[31:43] or you're happy about about about
[31:45] something about god in in church amen
[31:48] and often times we want to do something
[31:50] amen that maybe it might be
[31:52] inappropriate amen but find an avenue to
[31:54] let the pressure out you see
[31:56] find an avenue to let the pressure out
[31:58] because we've all got to have the
[32:00] pressure out
[32:01] amen
[32:02] we're just walking pressure cookers
[32:06] we got
[32:08] you know we'll i'll mention it here in
[32:10] just a moment but as a pressure cooker
[32:11] you know you got to have that little
[32:12] venue amen where the pressure's coming
[32:14] out constantly
[32:16] because if not that thing will blow up
[32:18] amen amen
[32:20] and some people they don't work well
[32:21] under pressure
[32:23] that's right amen some people do their
[32:25] best work under pressure
[32:29] i i would i would think that that's
[32:31] that's me but i don't
[32:34] know i i am i'm just i'm i'm like
[32:36] brother richard hyatt said the other day
[32:38] you know my sermons come two hours
[32:40] before the service yeah
[32:41] [Laughter]
[32:42] i just cannot prepare three weeks in
[32:45] advance for a sermon
[32:46] it just it's just not me because he put
[32:49] it right he said because you're going to
[32:50] go in there and start editing in it and
[32:52] start changing it and it's never right
[32:55] it's never going to be perfect
[32:57] amen
[32:59] now
[33:00] i've had moments where you have to be on
[33:03] the spot and you have to be ready in
[33:04] season and out of season they meant to
[33:06] just preach something i've had those
[33:08] moments in the mission field
[33:10] at other times amen that pressure falls
[33:13] on you amen
[33:14] amen
[33:15] and and some some of us you know some of
[33:17] you who went through high school and and
[33:20] maybe you do your best work when
[33:22] the day before you had to turn in your
[33:24] exam you know or or or the project or
[33:26] whatever it was and that's how i was but
[33:29] it never came out good
[33:31] [Laughter]
[33:32] i just always left things for the last
[33:34] minute and and and sometimes i got a
[33:37] good grade out of it you know
[33:40] but
[33:41] but that's just that's that's just me
[33:43] it's just
[33:44] but some of us we just work different
[33:46] ways amen some of us we've got to have
[33:48] it three weeks in advance right we've
[33:50] got to have it ahead of time
[33:52] amen so
[33:54] in the scripture that we were talking
[33:56] about here in james james he was
[33:57] speaking about how often times we we you
[34:00] know our temptations is to our
[34:03] temptations our pressure on us amen and
[34:06] it's under these pressures of life that
[34:08] that we recognize how strong we are
[34:11] amen
[34:13] it's in it's in it's in being in these
[34:15] pressures is we recognize uh am i
[34:18] drawing am i closer to god or am i
[34:20] further away from god
[34:22] you see because it's the way you respond
[34:23] to them
[34:24] it's the way you you react to them amen
[34:27] if you're not if you're not
[34:29] fellowshipping amen at church let's just
[34:31] put it in if you're not fellowshipping
[34:33] at church if you're not in the word of
[34:34] god if you're not listening to the
[34:36] message if you're not listening to the
[34:38] right things amen somebody says
[34:40] something to you at church amen and
[34:42] you'll
[34:43] immediately you'll take it as something
[34:45] antagonistic and you snap
[34:48] why because your concentration and your
[34:50] fellowship has been with other things of
[34:52] this world
[34:53] amen instead of the word of god
[34:56] you'll you'll immediately take it that
[34:58] way
[34:58] because you have been fellowshipping and
[35:00] you have been feeding on the wrong
[35:03] things
[35:04] take a person or a brother amen who has
[35:07] been feeding on the word of god who's
[35:08] who's been in contact with the with god
[35:11] in prayer and and who has been in
[35:12] fellowship amen and in that prayer
[35:15] closet amen it's always filled amen and
[35:17] when they come to church amen you can
[35:19] say whatever you wanted to them amen and
[35:22] they'll
[35:23] they'll take it a different way
[35:25] a more calm way
[35:26] they should at least that's right amen
[35:28] because why the holy spirit is working
[35:30] amen
[35:32] but when you when you when your holy
[35:34] spirit is up there amen just like
[35:36] brother branham said amen you can you
[35:38] can uh uh
[35:40] grieve the holy spirit amen
[35:42] does it mean that he's left you but i
[35:44] mean you can grieve him
[35:47] and then you're wondering my why is my
[35:49] life going this way why is it that i
[35:51] don't feel the joy that i that i've i
[35:53] felt even last week
[35:56] nice because your priorities of things
[35:57] changed
[35:59] now when you were fellowshipping with
[36:00] the word and in prayer amen and in your
[36:02] own time with god
[36:04] now something else has taken now you're
[36:06] worshiping something else
[36:08] amen so
[36:10] that will cause us to react under
[36:12] pressures in different ways amen
[36:15] proverbs 24 10 tells us
[36:18] if thou faint in the day of adversity
[36:21] watch what it says it says thy strength
[36:22] is small
[36:24] in other words if you fall the niv
[36:27] version says if you fall if you fail
[36:29] under pressure your strength is too
[36:31] small
[36:33] amen well i mean that's simple
[36:37] but we do it all the
[36:38] time we do it all the time
[36:42] why
[36:44] because we're under the wrong influence
[36:46] many times
[36:48] you know when you're weight lifting
[36:51] you've got to have that pressure amen
[36:53] upon your upon your muscles amen
[36:55] constantly amen
[36:57] and
[36:58] and you know amen how strong you are
[37:01] because look what the bible says that
[37:02] your strength is too small if you fell
[37:04] under pressure right
[37:06] and then when you when you feel like you
[37:08] you know you started maybe uh bench
[37:10] pressing you know a hundred pounds or
[37:12] whatever and then you bench spread okay
[37:15] i can do that now i want to upgrade to
[37:16] 200 and then you and then you oh no i
[37:19] can't do
[37:20] this you recognize where you're weak
[37:23] right
[37:24] right
[37:25] you recognize where you need to work on
[37:27] you went too much
[37:28] maybe you should you go to 110
[37:31] right if you could do 100 you see you
[37:33] take it little by little amen
[37:35] and it's in the trials of life in us
[37:37] living amen is in us living day to day
[37:40] that's why we cannot be just shut in
[37:43] somewhere and not experience the
[37:46] hardships of life or the negative
[37:48] aspects of life because when when that
[37:50] comes to you head on amen you don't
[37:53] you're just going to burst and you don't
[37:54] know what how you're going to handle it
[37:56] you've got to have the negative aspects
[37:58] of life otherwise you're not living life
[38:02] you've got to have that that way you can
[38:04] bench press the 200 pounds when you get
[38:06] to it
[38:08] if you don't experience 110 120 130 150
[38:11] you see how you gonna bench press the
[38:13] 200.
[38:14] amen
[38:16] you see
[38:17] so you've got to have the negative uh us
[38:19] as parents hey man we think sometimes
[38:21] well no i can't have my kid do that or
[38:23] see that or
[38:25] no because
[38:26] and then that that's going to come to
[38:29] them anyways
[38:30] so let them just experience it
[38:34] amen
[38:37] so
[38:39] because we're doing the service if we do
[38:41] that you see
[38:42] we're doing them as a service
[38:44] if we think that we can just over
[38:45] shelter them so much you see
[38:48] we're doing them at the service
[38:51] um
[38:52] let's look at diamonds here for just a
[38:54] moment
[38:55] if the brothers can can bring this
[38:56] picture
[38:59] picture number one
[39:02] amen you love the lord amen
[39:04] praise god
[39:06] all right
[39:07] so here here's a diamond isn't that so
[39:10] beautiful
[39:11] so pretty and all the girls are saying
[39:14] yeah that's beautiful look at that
[39:17] it was
[39:19] an engagement ring like that you know
[39:22] now you guys
[39:23] it's for girls
[39:26] but it i mean it's beautiful but
[39:29] you think my i'd love to have a diamond
[39:31] ring like that
[39:32] you girls oh that'd be pretty it'd be
[39:34] nice if if i'm going to get married in
[39:36] my hu and my husband-to-be gives me a
[39:38] diamond ring like this oh my that's
[39:40] that's beautiful and then if you go to
[39:42] the next picture
[39:45] you realize that this is where it came
[39:46] out of
[39:49] now do you want the diamond ring now
[39:52] the diamond ring came out of this
[39:54] that's out of this dark mess
[39:57] this nastiness
[39:59] this is coal
[40:01] this is what this is where diamonds are
[40:03] found and even
[40:04] even then diamonds go back to the
[40:07] previous picture brother
[40:09] diamonds when they come out of coal
[40:10] don't even look like this
[40:12] because it actually that took actually a
[40:15] a person that works with diamonds
[40:16] starting to cut the diamonds a certain
[40:18] way to make it look this way
[40:20] but definitely when they take the
[40:22] diamond out of the coal you know it
[40:24] definitely looks nicer than the coal for
[40:26] sure
[40:26] but when the diamond when the when the
[40:28] jeweler gets a hold of it oh my god
[40:31] he makes it even more beautiful amen
[40:33] when the jeweler of the god when our god
[40:36] the jeweler amen he gets a hold of your
[40:38] life amen
[40:40] it might hurt it might it might sting
[40:42] amen but hey you come out tried as gold
[40:44] amen you come out nice looking good
[40:47] amen because sometimes we come out rough
[40:49] amen next
[40:50] show the next picture right there we
[40:52] come out rough amen from the world
[40:55] you see
[40:56] we we come out rough i mean
[40:58] you don't expect somebody uh to
[41:00] immediately i mean they just do
[41:02] everything right when they start serving
[41:04] god no some of us come out come out a
[41:07] little rough
[41:08] amen somehow some of us come out a
[41:10] little you know we still got some habits
[41:12] that we need to let let go amen but it
[41:14] takes god to do that work
[41:17] it takes god little by little amen to do
[41:19] that work and when somebody's pressuring
[41:21] you listen you got to get rid of that
[41:23] you you can't come to church like that i
[41:25] i mean there comes a point in time where
[41:27] if you say you're a christian and you're
[41:28] still doing certain things i mean all
[41:30] right yeah we got to say something amen
[41:32] but but god amen deals with us little by
[41:35] little amen that's why we should have
[41:37] patience with one another
[41:38] amen i can't be your holy ghost
[41:41] i've always said that you can't be my
[41:43] holy ghost and
[41:44] and i can't be my daughter's holy ghost
[41:46] amen it takes an experience with god for
[41:49] them amen to to come out amen exactly
[41:52] the way god envisioned them from the
[41:53] beginning amen praise god
[41:56] because god has the best image better
[41:58] image of my children amen than i could
[42:00] ever have he knows best for them so does
[42:03] he knows best for your children amen
[42:06] but if but sometimes we want to impose
[42:08] our image on them and all we're doing is
[42:10] just putting them in a certain place
[42:12] where
[42:13] they don't want to come to church
[42:14] anymore
[42:15] because we want to impose our image
[42:17] amen it's not about your image it's
[42:19] about the image of god
[42:21] it's about the image of the word amen
[42:23] well i want that's the image that we
[42:24] want to
[42:25] we want them to have so that's where
[42:26] diamonds come out of and and and and
[42:29] diamonds uh uh there are what they are
[42:32] is crystallized carbon or coals
[42:35] that are formed underneath the earth
[42:37] under heavy heat and pressure
[42:40] see they're formed underneath the earth
[42:41] and there has to be a lot of heat
[42:44] and a lot of pressure for them
[42:47] otherwise you're not going to have a
[42:48] diamond
[42:49] yeah
[42:50] see next picture
[42:54] as you'll see so you get from a piece of
[42:56] coal and then you can get something like
[42:58] that how many knows that god can do work
[43:00] how many knows how many how many believe
[43:03] that god has done a work like that in
[43:04] your life
[43:06] he's still cutting me
[43:09] you know it ain't until that body change
[43:11] amen till i really come out perfect amen
[43:14] praise god but he's still cutting each
[43:15] and every one of us amen but we're
[43:17] diamonds god already sees the end the
[43:19] end result
[43:21] amen when he was taking us out of the
[43:23] piece of lump amen see we were in the
[43:25] middle of the lump amen we were in the
[43:27] middle of the of the darkness amen but
[43:29] he was already seeing the end result
[43:31] right there
[43:33] he saw it before the foundation of the
[43:34] world
[43:35] he saw you amen perfect
[43:38] without spot without wrinkles my bride
[43:41] amen shining
[43:43] amen bright amen that's how he saw it
[43:45] that's how he saw you amen and when
[43:47] satan comes around amen and he's telling
[43:49] you all these lies that you can't make
[43:51] it that you're you're you're just the
[43:53] worst person in the world that that that
[43:55] you're just no good and look what you
[43:57] did yesterday and you're going to do it
[43:58] again tomorrow
[44:00] just just going to show them back the
[44:02] picture that god saw of you amen
[44:04] your picture is in the word where it
[44:06] says abroad without spot and without
[44:09] wrinkle that's me
[44:11] that that's my scripture amen praise god
[44:14] i'm his bride
[44:16] hallelujah
[44:17] amen so let's look for a moment uh
[44:20] examples in the bible of of people under
[44:22] pressure amen moses at the red sea in
[44:25] exodus chapter 14 you can read that the
[44:27] brother the brothers you can turn that
[44:29] off
[44:30] we'll come back to it here just a moment
[44:32] we see uh in the example there when
[44:35] moses was was commissioned they meant to
[44:37] get the people out of the
[44:39] the children of israel out of egypt and
[44:41] and they came out oh happy and rejoicing
[44:44] and god delivered us and then here comes
[44:46] the point where they got to the the red
[44:48] sea uh block it was blocking their way
[44:51] amen to continue through and and and
[44:55] moses didn't know what to do so he had
[44:57] pressure
[44:58] amen he had pressure from this side
[45:00] pressure from this side pressure in
[45:02] front of him and pressure behind him
[45:04] because the egyptians were right behind
[45:05] him i mean there was pressure north
[45:08] south east west on him
[45:10] goodness gracious
[45:11] i didn't want to be moses
[45:13] amen moses was chosen specifically for
[45:16] that purpose
[45:17] amen but can you imagine the pressure
[45:19] that moses fell on him and when and when
[45:21] and and he got to a point where that all
[45:23] that pressure and he didn't even know
[45:24] what to do
[45:25] and he was there crying and feeling the
[45:27] pressure and on top of that the people
[45:29] his the children who had just seen
[45:32] god i mean completely annihilating the
[45:36] egyptians i mean killing their firstborn
[45:39] and and and and
[45:41] flies all over the place and frogs all
[45:43] over their houses and none of that
[45:45] touched their house and here they are
[45:47] complaining about a big obstacle in
[45:48] front of them
[45:51] and and moses was the one receiving the
[45:53] breadth of all that
[45:54] the majority of i mean all that pressure
[45:56] that he felt right i mean
[45:58] that's that pressure cooker i mean it
[46:00] was getting ready to blow right there
[46:02] amen but you know he was like lord what
[46:05] am i supposed to do i got these i got
[46:07] this is what you call me to do what am i
[46:09] to do
[46:10] and god i told all that god told him was
[46:12] just stand still
[46:14] stand still don't try to figure it out
[46:17] don't try to don't try to do it your way
[46:19] or what you learned last year or what
[46:21] you learned two years ago or what you
[46:24] think it might be
[46:25] just stand still
[46:28] and let god have his way
[46:31] lord stand still and see the salvation
[46:33] of god
[46:34] amen and he told him amen put out the
[46:36] rod
[46:37] amen and he put out the rod and we we
[46:40] know the story the seed that's he parted
[46:42] and they crossed on dry ground amen amen
[46:45] relief the pressure he might sure when
[46:48] moses got to the other side i'm sure
[46:50] oh god thank you
[46:53] amen he probably wanted to get
[46:54] his sister's tambourine and just dance
[46:56] along with her amen glory
[47:00] his sister was the one amen using the
[47:02] tambourine he probably got in there with
[47:04] him that's right you see i'd i'd be
[47:06] right there with her amen after a
[47:08] pressure event like that
[47:10] amen your your homework young people
[47:13] isn't that kind of pressure now
[47:15] no amen
[47:16] you're you're
[47:17] you're you're us parents sometimes you
[47:20] know our our children may not be doing
[47:21] what we want them to do it that's not
[47:23] that kind of pressure
[47:25] amen it's pressure amen but moses had
[47:27] some pressure on him
[47:29] amen
[47:30] we saw we also see if you you can read
[47:32] that in exodus chapter 14. i encourage
[47:34] you to
[47:35] and
[47:36] also in genesis chapter 39 we see the
[47:39] pressure that was put on joseph
[47:41] amen by potiphar's wife
[47:45] to lay with her
[47:48] that's a pressure
[47:50] it was a sexual pressure
[47:52] amen potiphar's wife liked him
[47:55] or at least lusted after him
[47:58] and and and and he could he could have
[48:00] done it and nobody maybe would have done
[48:02] anything
[48:03] saw anything or heard anything or
[48:06] potiphar would never maybe found out but
[48:08] he feared god so much amen he said i
[48:10] cannot do this
[48:12] i cannot do this because for one amen
[48:14] i'm serving potiphar this and you're his
[48:16] wife
[48:18] and most and foremost i'm served
[48:20] a god amen who's my true master
[48:24] amen when you put god first
[48:27] as your true master amen no matter what
[48:29] pressures come on you amen because
[48:31] sexual pressure is a strong thing i mean
[48:34] we see it everywhere nowadays
[48:36] sexual pressures everywhere man go
[48:39] online and add just showing you an ad
[48:42] there'll be a sexual pressure right
[48:43] there
[48:45] completely change your thought process
[48:48] and you were just looking for a sermon
[48:50] to listen to
[48:52] the satan
[48:54] i mean we see those pressures everywhere
[48:57] sexual pressure joseph had them
[49:00] and there was no internet back then
[49:03] but he had a physical pressure amen
[49:06] to do something but he put god first
[49:08] amen he put god first put god first in
[49:11] your life
[49:13] remember always put
[49:14] in front of you what he did for you
[49:18] joseph didn't even have something like
[49:20] that to look to
[49:21] he didn't he didn't think oh jesus died
[49:23] for me on the cross of calvary and i i i
[49:26] owe my life to him look at all the
[49:28] pressure that he went through at the
[49:29] garden of gethsemane i can't do this he
[49:31] didn't even have he didn't even have a
[49:33] bible to look at
[49:34] amen
[49:35] and yet he was able to withstand
[49:37] temptation amen how much more you and i
[49:39] amen with the grace and the mercy and
[49:41] the word of god and the eleven hundred
[49:44] messages that we have there is no excuse
[49:46] when sexual pressure comes into our in
[49:48] our heart i know it's hard
[49:50] and i know it it's it's very present
[49:52] because we're humans and we're
[49:54] uh
[49:55] joseph was just as much human as we are
[49:57] but you have something to lean on
[49:59] you have something to look to amen run
[50:02] go take a cold shower do something
[50:04] that's what my mom told me just go take
[50:05] a cold shower
[50:06] [Laughter]
[50:08] do something to get get out of that
[50:10] because you start sitting there feeding
[50:12] that that's it brother you're going to
[50:14] fall and you're going to be condemned
[50:16] and then
[50:17] and then you're not going to want to
[50:18] come to church you're not going to
[50:19] fellowship with people why because i
[50:21] don't feel worthy
[50:23] i'm just being honest with you
[50:26] don't look at me that way
[50:28] you guys are just as much joseph as i
[50:30] was yes
[50:33] that's just how it is but joseph did it
[50:36] without the holy ghost how much more
[50:38] with the holy ghost amen
[50:41] so there was pressure there sexual
[50:43] pressure we also see queen esther and
[50:45] then she had pressure regarding the
[50:46] destruction of her people you can read
[50:48] that in esther iv
[50:50] you know she had pressure upon her there
[50:52] was an edict that went out that the
[50:54] hebrews were going to be uh destroyed
[50:56] they were going to and and there was a
[50:58] pressure mounted upon her mordecai was
[51:00] telling her uh uh hey esther there's
[51:03] something you've got to intervene for
[51:04] your people
[51:06] and so there was that pressure on her
[51:08] and she took the right decision
[51:10] she said hold on a second you see she
[51:12] said we're just going to cut fast for
[51:14] three days i believe it was three days
[51:17] and let's and and and let let's stand
[51:20] still and see the salvation of the lord
[51:23] that's exactly what she did what moses
[51:25] should have done amen esther did right
[51:27] away
[51:28] amen
[51:29] and when you stand still sometimes
[51:31] things come to your life and you don't
[51:32] know what to do amen just hold on
[51:35] wait it out
[51:36] don't don't react
[51:38] let's wait it out
[51:39] because god has a better a better way of
[51:42] resolving things than if we if we do if
[51:44] we just lash out and quickly say things
[51:47] or do things you see
[51:48] oftentimes we do the wrong thing when we
[51:51] do it out of out of out of uh
[51:55] yeah the spur of the moment
[51:57] most of the time our decisions are not
[51:59] the right decisions
[52:00] but if we just hold on
[52:02] stand still
[52:04] three two one
[52:06] one two three
[52:08] what in the world is bothering me
[52:11] three two one
[52:13] one two three
[52:15] what in the world
[52:16] is bothering me you just repeat that
[52:18] about five times and you oh okay
[52:21] i can wait this out
[52:22] [Laughter]
[52:25] now you can go home and you can repeat
[52:27] that and then you practice that and
[52:29] three two one
[52:31] one two three
[52:32] what in the world is bothering me
[52:35] just keep repeating it and it'll help
[52:37] you
[52:37] [Laughter]
[52:40] amen
[52:42] and you know what
[52:44] esther's people amen they were it wasn't
[52:47] the exact result that she wanted
[52:49] but god did something for them
[52:51] god allowed for the hebrews amen to take
[52:53] weapons and fight back and you know what
[52:56] they overcame their enemy amen
[52:58] and then we also know the very famous
[53:01] one amen daniel chapter 3 you can read
[53:03] about the three hebrew children amen
[53:05] shadrach meshach and abednego they were
[53:07] pressured to worship amen
[53:09] nebuchadnezzar's image
[53:12] and they said no i'd rather worship god
[53:13] amen amen
[53:16] what a stance that they took they didn't
[53:17] have a bible they didn't have the holy
[53:19] ghost in their life all they had was
[53:21] what they learned from their parents
[53:23] what they took from is from from israel
[53:26] amen and and and they said no we're
[53:28] going to stand and worship our
[53:30] who we've been taught to worship our
[53:31] true living god amen and and
[53:34] and and and they no matter what the king
[53:36] said
[53:37] they were respectful to the king
[53:40] they said they said old king you know
[53:42] what do we we
[53:44] uh blessed are you king i believe is
[53:46] what they say something like that
[53:48] yeah live forever we respect you we
[53:51] respect you but we can't do this
[53:53] you see you don't have to get snappy you
[53:55] don't have to get you know
[53:57] do you know what we believe do you know
[53:59] that we serve the god of of israel do we
[54:02] i mean they were quickly gone into that
[54:04] oven amen and not with a with the right
[54:08] attitude not with the right heart but
[54:10] you see they had a right heart about it
[54:11] amen amen and we know the end story amen
[54:13] because they took
[54:15] they were pressured amen and all that
[54:17] pressure went in them even in the oven
[54:20] even at the at the doorway of the oven
[54:22] that pressure was upon them
[54:25] and i can just imagine amen i wonder if
[54:27] they even saw that fourth man as they
[54:29] were walking in the oven the fourth man
[54:31] was already telling them you just come
[54:32] on
[54:34] okay
[54:36] fire all around them amen it doesn't
[54:38] matter what pressures you're going
[54:39] through saints it doesn't matter what
[54:41] happens in your life you could be at the
[54:43] point of death amen but say jesus is
[54:45] telling you come on i got this i'm here
[54:47] to help you don't worry you're
[54:49] everything is under control
[54:52] because why you put me first and now
[54:54] it's time for me amen
[54:57] draw nigh unto me and he said and i will
[54:59] draw an eye unto you
[55:01] amen
[55:02] praise god
[55:04] amen
[55:06] so we need
[55:07] we need confidence and patience amen i
[55:10] like what hebrews says here in hebrews
[55:12] chapter 10
[55:13] verse 35 it says cast not away therefore
[55:16] your confidence
[55:17] which hath great recompense of reward
[55:20] amen the enemy can't touch you amen
[55:23] he he can't touch you with for you know
[55:26] if you've been called to something in
[55:27] your life
[55:28] amen he he can't touch that calling in
[55:31] your life but he can make you try to
[55:33] lose confidence in in your calling
[55:36] and if he can make you lose confidence
[55:38] in your calling amen he's got you
[55:41] oh nobody likes me nobody nobody uh
[55:44] likes the way i preach nobody like amen
[55:47] that's that's sometimes as we us as
[55:49] preachers we go through that
[55:50] nobody heard anything that i said amen
[55:53] amen and your pr and probably
[55:55] the the person that you least expect
[55:58] amen got something out of that sermon
[56:02] amen i've been there
[56:04] done that
[56:06] i've got the t-shirt
[56:07] the mouse pad and the hat to go with it
[56:11] i've got to have confidence in what god
[56:14] has called me to do because i'm not
[56:15] doing it for you i'm doing it for him
[56:18] he's he's the one that i'm doing it for
[56:21] amen you're secondary
[56:23] but if i'm thinking hey lord i'm doing
[56:25] this for you
[56:27] then everything will go right
[56:30] cast not away there for your confidence
[56:31] which have great recompense of reward
[56:34] amen
[56:36] verse 36 says for you have need of
[56:39] patience
[56:40] amen it's important for the believer to
[56:42] have patience look look you have need of
[56:45] patience that after you have done the
[56:47] will of god you might receive the
[56:49] promise amen you have need of patience
[56:54] otherwise it wouldn't be listed here
[56:57] you have need of it
[57:00] and patience only comes by pressures
[57:03] temptations
[57:04] amen sufferings
[57:06] and things in your life
[57:08] not everything going honky-dory not
[57:10] everything being happy and everybody
[57:12] liking you
[57:13] because i guarantee you everybody will
[57:15] not like you
[57:18] and you should be okay with that amen
[57:21] as long as god likes me
[57:23] as long as god loves me and i know he
[57:25] does because he died for me
[57:27] amen he said he loved me this much
[57:31] to spread his arms amen on a cross
[57:34] and die for me amen
[57:36] i know he loves me
[57:37] and that's all that matters
[57:39] and what whatever anybody thinks or
[57:41] whether anybody says about me amen
[57:43] that's between them and god amen
[57:46] praise god
[57:48] jesus loves me this i know
[57:51] why because the bible tells me so amen
[57:54] praise god let me go a little quicker
[57:56] here persecution is a form of pressure
[57:59] amen
[58:00] we we we see there uh peter was under a
[58:04] certain pressure
[58:06] when they took jesus from the from the
[58:07] garden of gethsemane and they took him
[58:09] in uh into pilate and to pilots hollow
[58:11] into the hall there and they're getting
[58:13] ready to whip him and all that peter the
[58:15] bible says that peter followed to see
[58:17] what was going on
[58:19] and you can read the details of it there
[58:20] in john chapter 18
[58:23] where and that's where peter denies
[58:24] jesus three times
[58:26] now peter was feeling the pressure he
[58:28] had already
[58:29] told the lord he told god he said i will
[58:32] not deny you even though jesus had told
[58:34] them you will deny me
[58:36] he's denying the word of jesus
[58:40] jesus the word peter's seeing all the
[58:43] miracles that took place in his life
[58:45] peter's seen jesus welcome water even he
[58:49] himself walked on water peter himself
[58:52] seeing great things for three and a half
[58:54] years jesus tells them peter you're
[58:56] going to deny me thrice
[58:58] no i won't lord
[58:59] you're wrong
[59:01] isn't that how we do jesus sometimes he
[59:04] says something to us about the word but
[59:05] we do it otherwise because we think we
[59:08] know better
[59:10] right
[59:11] and exactly
[59:13] peter came into that point where people
[59:15] started saying hey you were with him
[59:17] you are one of them second time no i'm
[59:19] not with him i wasn't with him i don't
[59:21] know who you are and then third time he
[59:23] starts cursing
[59:25] and what happens the crows
[59:27] and he fulfills exactly what jesus told
[59:30] me
[59:31] but you know what i like about it is
[59:33] there if you read there in luke
[59:35] the bible says they're in luke that
[59:36] jesus just turned over and just looked
[59:39] he saw when peter denied him three times
[59:41] if you go back and read in luke
[59:43] jesus says he just turned to him and
[59:45] look i can just imagine the look that
[59:47] jesus gave him it wasn't a look of
[59:48] sternness and see i told you see you
[59:51] were wrong
[59:53] no it was it was like
[59:55] don't worry i'm making a way for you
[59:58] don't worry remember remember peter i
[1:00:00] prayed for you
[1:00:01] all right amen
[1:00:03] praise god
[1:00:04] i don't think jesus was giving him a a
[1:00:07] a spiteful look amen and that's what
[1:00:09] caused peter to run and weep the bible
[1:00:12] says that he wept bitterly that's right
[1:00:14] amen i caused his repentance amen when
[1:00:16] you really look into the eyes of jesus
[1:00:18] and when you really look into his word
[1:00:20] and you realize who you are and what
[1:00:22] you've done amen to to to put him in
[1:00:25] that position
[1:00:26] that he's at amen that'll cause you a
[1:00:28] man to get down and repent and and and
[1:00:31] seek him with all of your heart but the
[1:00:34] reason why we don't do that and we think
[1:00:36] we don't need to do that anymore is
[1:00:37] because we're not looking to him on the
[1:00:39] cross anymore
[1:00:40] we're not looking to we're we're not
[1:00:42] thinking that it was our sins and it's
[1:00:44] our our daily failures that put him
[1:00:47] there
[1:00:48] amen
[1:00:49] when we start looking at him that way
[1:00:50] amen it causes us to have more of a
[1:00:52] repentant heart amen
[1:00:54] amen
[1:00:56] but branham says here so so so jesus so
[1:00:59] peter was had that persecution on him
[1:01:02] there amen that was a form of
[1:01:03] persecution that was falling upon him he
[1:01:05] was afraid of it because he didn't want
[1:01:07] to be found out that he was walking with
[1:01:09] jesus
[1:01:10] amen so brother brown says here in the
[1:01:12] in the message the third exodus are you
[1:01:14] still with me don't fall asleep
[1:01:17] the natural man
[1:01:18] the antichrist is growing now
[1:01:22] through politics he's already got the
[1:01:24] white house
[1:01:28] in religion he's got all the people so
[1:01:30] scrupled up
[1:01:32] sounds like 20 21 to me
[1:01:35] till actually they'd fall right for it
[1:01:37] and the denominational leaders
[1:01:39] practically every church that there is
[1:01:41] in the nation is already in the
[1:01:43] confederation of churches
[1:01:46] this was in 1963 when he said this
[1:01:49] ramses is growing and they're all
[1:01:51] uniting together and
[1:01:54] and that's what they'll have and what
[1:01:55] does what does it do it makes a power a
[1:01:58] beast just like the first one
[1:02:00] then there's a persecution coming upon
[1:02:02] all those who won't unite with it
[1:02:04] and the boycott
[1:02:07] i mean i believe we're coming to that
[1:02:09] shortly it'll be too late then you've
[1:02:12] already took the mark
[1:02:14] don't say i'll do it then you better do
[1:02:16] it now
[1:02:18] ramsey's was growing and he he's talking
[1:02:19] about ramses because he's comparing to
[1:02:22] ramses the the pharaoh in egypt when
[1:02:24] during moses time and moses god had
[1:02:27] moses doing something in his life amen
[1:02:30] while while moses while ramses was
[1:02:32] growing but then this is what he's going
[1:02:34] to say here but remember while ramses
[1:02:36] was growing into power in egypt god had
[1:02:38] moses in the wilderness
[1:02:40] he was growing too
[1:02:42] ramses had a political system god had a
[1:02:44] spiritual system under a prophet
[1:02:47] ready to come down to speak to the
[1:02:49] people amen
[1:02:50] so there's that that persecution amen
[1:02:53] saints we're i believe that that right
[1:02:55] now we're still facing good times sure
[1:02:59] i mean it's still good
[1:03:01] but but pressures are coming
[1:03:04] there are pressures coming little by
[1:03:06] little right now
[1:03:08] politically
[1:03:10] amen
[1:03:11] and are you gonna cave in
[1:03:13] or are you gonna stay with the word
[1:03:16] brother
[1:03:17] because
[1:03:18] it'll come down i mean they're they're
[1:03:21] they're making fun of christians i i was
[1:03:23] i was watching a thing just last weekend
[1:03:25] they were having some sort of prayer
[1:03:26] vigil and in colorado i think it was
[1:03:29] something like that and there goes uh
[1:03:31] the antifa group
[1:03:33] just throwing just throwing stuff at
[1:03:35] them and saying
[1:03:37] stuff like is this jesus of you gonna
[1:03:39] save you now and just and just being all
[1:03:43] people can't even have public prayer
[1:03:44] anymore now
[1:03:46] oh but that's just in colorado well you
[1:03:48] watch and it'll happen here too man
[1:03:51] amen
[1:03:52] that's just damn what's happening here
[1:03:54] well you watch it's happening it's
[1:03:56] happened it'll happen and when it does
[1:03:58] amen let's look back at what brother
[1:03:59] branham said about it amen and we'll
[1:04:01] realize it don't wait till then to get
[1:04:04] right with god
[1:04:06] don't wait till the ark door is closed
[1:04:08] to get right with god
[1:04:10] get right with god amen prepare to enter
[1:04:13] the ark amen before the ark door closes
[1:04:16] amen because by then it will be too late
[1:04:18] amen brother branham talks about a
[1:04:20] squeeze for the bride amen it's a
[1:04:22] squeeze it's a pressure that's coming
[1:04:24] upon us and that's in order to manifest
[1:04:26] that third pull in its fullness
[1:04:29] see brother branham said this and and
[1:04:30] the message looked away to jesus now
[1:04:32] remember there will never be an
[1:04:33] impersonation of that third of that and
[1:04:36] i put in parentheses third pull because
[1:04:38] that's what he was talking about because
[1:04:40] it can't be see it cannot be now it is
[1:04:42] it's an existence and i have i'm warned
[1:04:45] of this that soon right at this time now
[1:04:47] it's just happened so it could identify
[1:04:49] its presence among you see but it will
[1:04:51] not be used in a great way until this
[1:04:53] council begins to tighten up
[1:04:56] and he's talking about the council of
[1:04:58] churches
[1:04:59] and when it does when that does the
[1:05:02] pentecostals and so forth can almost
[1:05:04] impersonate anything can be done but
[1:05:07] when that time comes
[1:05:08] this is the only time that brother
[1:05:10] branham mentions the phrase the squeeze
[1:05:14] i was actually surprised i thought i
[1:05:16] would see that more but he references it
[1:05:18] to it in different times doesn't
[1:05:20] actually say the squeeze or squeeze but
[1:05:24] he talks about it but this is the actual
[1:05:26] only quote where he actually says does
[1:05:27] squeeze when the squeeze comes down then
[1:05:30] you'll see what you've seen temporarily
[1:05:32] which is that third pool you've seen
[1:05:34] temporarily where it was that he
[1:05:36] manifested be manifested in the fullness
[1:05:38] of its power
[1:05:39] when you continue
[1:05:41] reading down in paragraph 49 he says
[1:05:43] here it's tightening and then when that
[1:05:46] time comes and the press comes to a
[1:05:49] place to where you're pressed out
[1:05:52] that means you can't be part of that of
[1:05:54] their group anymore because of what you
[1:05:55] believe and your stand
[1:05:58] then watch what i'm fixing to tell you
[1:06:00] in a few minutes watch the third pull
[1:06:02] then
[1:06:02] see and it'll be absolutely to the total
[1:06:05] loss but it will be for the bride and
[1:06:07] the church
[1:06:08] amen
[1:06:10] but what's going to cause that is going
[1:06:11] to be a pressure
[1:06:13] it's going to be a press
[1:06:15] brother brown i'm talking about
[1:06:16] oppressed
[1:06:17] you see
[1:06:18] we're mad
[1:06:20] well
[1:06:20] when you have olives and when you have
[1:06:22] grapes right
[1:06:24] they might be some little juice or a
[1:06:26] little oil might might be on the outside
[1:06:29] that's just temporarily that's just a
[1:06:31] little bit that's why brother branham
[1:06:33] was saying
[1:06:34] temporarily the third pool was
[1:06:36] manifested in his life you see in his
[1:06:38] ministry
[1:06:39] amen but it's gonna take a squeeze when
[1:06:41] you squeeze those grapes and when you
[1:06:43] squeeze those olives
[1:06:45] that's when the fullness comes out
[1:06:48] and i believe that's what we're seeing
[1:06:50] right now since
[1:06:51] it's starting that squeeze is starting
[1:06:54] amen upon us
[1:06:55] and not you'd never think that it was
[1:06:57] going to happen the way it's happening
[1:07:02] it's a political thing but it's supposed
[1:07:04] to eventually it'll it'll head down to
[1:07:06] more something more religious now
[1:07:09] more more spiritual
[1:07:11] see
[1:07:12] and if we can't stand firm on just the
[1:07:14] physical things how are you going to
[1:07:15] stand afirm when the spiritual more
[1:07:17] spiritual aspect of it comes
[1:07:20] amen
[1:07:22] if you deny
[1:07:23] christ amen
[1:07:25] when somebody at school asks you you
[1:07:27] believe that you go to that church
[1:07:31] how are you how are you going to stand
[1:07:33] when
[1:07:34] when the when someone's asking you what
[1:07:35] do you believe
[1:07:38] are you going to keep you're not going
[1:07:39] to worship here anymore we're going to
[1:07:41] close this church down unless you go
[1:07:43] ahead and sign this or do that or the
[1:07:45] other
[1:07:46] what are you going to do then
[1:07:47] if you can't
[1:07:49] say
[1:07:50] i'm a christian now
[1:07:52] do you see what i'm trying to
[1:07:54] say you can't handle the pressure now
[1:07:57] how are you going to handle that
[1:07:57] pressure then
[1:07:59] amen so
[1:08:01] amen praise god
[1:08:04] now let's look at something here real
[1:08:05] quick and then we're almost done amen
[1:08:07] the right away and the r and the wrong
[1:08:10] way to handle pressure
[1:08:12] amen
[1:08:14] praise god
[1:08:19] don't worry brother wait i'm not gonna
[1:08:24] [Laughter]
[1:08:26] this is the wrong way to handle pressure
[1:08:30] amen
[1:08:31] you know
[1:08:33] you know what happens i don't know if
[1:08:34] the brothers have a picture of it
[1:08:36] if you're if you if you got this soda
[1:08:39] can
[1:08:41] and that's what happens
[1:08:45] i wasn't going to do it here so don't
[1:08:46] worry
[1:08:48] we'll just show you a picture because
[1:08:49] all of you know exactly what would
[1:08:51] happen but this is like some of us
[1:08:53] sometimes
[1:08:55] you know we've got so much pressure in
[1:08:56] our life
[1:08:58] i'm in work and and and family and and
[1:09:01] and the pressures of everything that we
[1:09:02] have to do bills and everything like
[1:09:04] that and we got it so so bottled up and
[1:09:06] there's no outlet there's no way to let
[1:09:08] out that pressure you see in a can
[1:09:10] there's no way to let it out but brother
[1:09:12] tony says something wrong to me
[1:09:14] [Music]
[1:09:18] and he's he's all wet now i'm all
[1:09:20] drenched in everybody even the ones
[1:09:22] around you amen they're all drenched and
[1:09:24] it's a mess
[1:09:26] we're all sticky
[1:09:28] why
[1:09:29] because you were you were manifesting
[1:09:31] the wrong you were letting it out the
[1:09:32] wrong way
[1:09:34] you weren't in that closet with god the
[1:09:36] way you needed to be you weren't in the
[1:09:38] word the way you needed to be you
[1:09:39] weren't listening to the messages the
[1:09:41] way you needed to be amen praise god
[1:09:43] this is how some of us sometimes come to
[1:09:45] church all shaken up
[1:09:47] watching netflix
[1:09:49] youtube videos
[1:09:53] conspiracy theories
[1:09:54] [Music]
[1:10:00] brother i need you to take out the trash
[1:10:07] nobody can say anything to you
[1:10:11] what that's that's how it happens
[1:10:15] amen but we want to be like like like
[1:10:18] this and the brothers can put the next
[1:10:19] picture
[1:10:22] we want to be uh more like a pressure
[1:10:25] cooker
[1:10:26] you know
[1:10:28] because i mean there's there's pressure
[1:10:29] in our life you see
[1:10:31] we have pressures in our life
[1:10:33] every one of those of us have pressure
[1:10:36] amen but there's a control mechanism
[1:10:39] and that's the holy ghost
[1:10:40] right
[1:10:41] in prayer amen you see normally normally
[1:10:44] the pressure cooker i mean has a ring
[1:10:47] on the lid hey man it's a it's a rubber
[1:10:49] ring i was going to bring a pressure
[1:10:51] cooker here but my wife's like i don't
[1:10:52] think so yeah
[1:10:55] amen so
[1:10:58] so i had to just show you the picture
[1:11:01] this is the exact one my wife has
[1:11:05] but i told her i said you know what
[1:11:06] sweetheart i think i think i'm gonna
[1:11:08] take that pressure cooker i'm just gonna
[1:11:09] flop it on the on the pulpit just like
[1:11:11] that this is like i don't think so
[1:11:14] but anyways
[1:11:16] but a pressure cooker has that rubber
[1:11:18] ring under and that's not to let you
[1:11:20] know so pressure doesn't escape you know
[1:11:21] i mean
[1:11:23] it's to keep it all in
[1:11:24] because what cooks the food inside
[1:11:26] faster is the fact that there's a lot of
[1:11:28] heat and there's a lot of pressure it's
[1:11:30] like the pressure is bringing putting
[1:11:32] that heat further into that meat or that
[1:11:36] vegetable whatever i mean i remember
[1:11:38] when my mom she used to cook beans
[1:11:41] and uh
[1:11:42] and we always cook beans and pressure
[1:11:44] cookers
[1:11:45] and i remember in colombia you know we
[1:11:47] would be i would be she'd put us for a
[1:11:49] nap around noon time and you'd hear that
[1:11:51] pressure cooker i'd hear it in the
[1:11:53] kitchen
[1:11:57] and i said oh man we're gonna have some
[1:11:58] beans tonight and i said i hope i'm
[1:12:00] gonna put some collard greens in it too
[1:12:02] and i like beans with collard greens and
[1:12:05] some some pork in it and things like
[1:12:07] that since the trudy you remember that
[1:12:08] now
[1:12:12] but you see that little ch
[1:12:14] it's because there's a control valve you
[1:12:16] know that there's a there's a valve
[1:12:18] where where there's there might be
[1:12:20] pressure
[1:12:21] amen but there's a control mechanism
[1:12:23] where that pressure is coming out right
[1:12:24] you see i believe this should be how a
[1:12:27] christian should work right and man we
[1:12:29] got that ring under that amen that's
[1:12:31] we're sealed that's exactly right
[1:12:33] eternal life
[1:12:34] it's a ring right sealed amen but we
[1:12:38] have that avenue of prayer
[1:12:39] the holy ghost amen kind of control
[1:12:44] don't let it out too much don't let it
[1:12:46] you watch what you're going to say to
[1:12:47] brother such and such don't think that
[1:12:49] amen he said this to you hey man you
[1:12:51] just watch
[1:12:53] it
[1:12:55] amen because if there's not that control
[1:12:57] mechanism there to let out that pressure
[1:12:59] what happened so i don't know if some of
[1:13:00] you have had
[1:13:02] pressure cookers blow up before i've
[1:13:04] never seen it before but
[1:13:05] i've heard some some
[1:13:07] some uh
[1:13:08] bad things about it amen
[1:13:11] so there's a the control mechanism in
[1:13:13] our life that we should have amen
[1:13:15] don't be like that fanta can now
[1:13:18] it's the same i mean it's building the
[1:13:20] same pressures you know it's almost like
[1:13:22] it this is cold
[1:13:23] but uh
[1:13:24] amen but still
[1:13:27] have a control mechanism and god is the
[1:13:29] only one that can put that in you in
[1:13:30] your life
[1:13:31] the holy ghost
[1:13:33] the holy ghost is the only one that can
[1:13:35] control that foul mouth of yours that
[1:13:37] can control the temptations uh that you
[1:13:40] have in your life amen so that you don't
[1:13:42] heed them they can control the thoughts
[1:13:44] amen that that that come through you
[1:13:46] you're you can't do nothing about the
[1:13:48] thoughts amen but there's that the holy
[1:13:50] ghost can help you control those
[1:13:51] thoughts amen you're walking you're
[1:13:53] driving down the road amen you see a
[1:13:55] bad dressed woman you young man amen you
[1:13:58] don't need to look and sit there and
[1:13:59] stare
[1:14:00] you know you don't need to do that
[1:14:02] the holy ghost
[1:14:04] can control that that's right amen amen
[1:14:07] that's right
[1:14:08] the holy ghost can control that
[1:14:11] amen praise god
[1:14:14] you want to be a pressure cooker amen
[1:14:17] that's the right way to handle pressure

[1:15:24] benefit from
[1:15:25] amen draw strength from god's word amen
[1:15:29] sometimes we want to go to dr dobson's
[1:15:31] book amen
[1:15:32] or something like that that's fine but
[1:15:33] amen god's word is the one that gives us
[1:15:36] i don't i have never read the word of
[1:15:38] god and think uh and not read something
[1:15:41] new that can help me amen
[1:15:43] there's always something new in the word
[1:15:45] to help me especially at the moment that
[1:15:48] i need it amen when that pressure of
[1:15:50] life is coming on you amen
[1:15:52] uh look for support from helpful fam
[1:15:55] helpful
[1:15:56] family members and friends
[1:16:00] helpful is the key
[1:16:02] do not go to your best friend who is
[1:16:04] always critical
[1:16:06] amen and who thinks that life is is is
[1:16:09] just is is just a mess and it's not
[1:16:12] worth amen and who's always depressed
[1:16:14] don't go to that person go to the one
[1:16:16] who's always joyful who's always amen do
[1:16:19] you see what the word of god says here
[1:16:21] who goes to church
[1:16:22] my goodness and who you know that has a
[1:16:24] good reputation amongst the people amen
[1:16:28] sometimes we need to find a place where
[1:16:29] we can just get to ourselves get along
[1:16:32] i mean sometimes being amongst people a
[1:16:34] lot that that builds a lot of pressure
[1:16:37] and we need to get get excited but
[1:16:38] sometimes husbands and wives need to do
[1:16:40] that right amen you know
[1:16:42] i can't you know i can't my wife and me
[1:16:45] we can't always be together you know
[1:16:47] i mean we'll get on each other's nerves
[1:16:50] i gotta get away i gotta go do my own
[1:16:52] thing for a little while she's gotta go
[1:16:54] do her own thing for a little while and
[1:16:55] that helps release out the the wiggles
[1:16:58] and the pressures
[1:16:59] and we come back together and we hug and
[1:17:02] we kiss we talk
[1:17:05] and we might eat sushi together
[1:17:09] laugh
[1:17:11] amen laugh
[1:17:13] look what the proverb says proverbs 17
[1:17:15] 22 says a joyful heart is a good
[1:17:17] medicine but a crushed spirit dries up
[1:17:20] the bones
[1:17:21] job says
[1:17:23] 8 21 says he will he will yet fill your
[1:17:26] mouth with laughter in your lips with
[1:17:28] shouting
[1:17:29] so if there was anything wrong with
[1:17:30] laughing or shouting then then job
[1:17:32] wouldn't have said that the word of god
[1:17:34] wouldn't have said that
[1:17:35] laughter is like a vacation amen an
[1:17:38] instant vacation
[1:17:41] i mean you want a vacation right away
[1:17:43] there it is just laugh

[1:19:44] pressure ever and we you can read that
[1:19:46] in luke chapter 22 we don't have time
[1:19:48] amen but the bible says there in verse
[1:19:50] 39 it says and he came out and went as
[1:19:52] he want to the mount of olives
[1:19:55] olives
[1:20:00] and that's where all
[1:20:01] all everything that that that that he
[1:20:04] could give was given right there
[1:20:06] he died before he actually died on the
[1:20:08] cross he died right there
[1:20:10] amen but watch in verse in verse 4
[1:20:13] verse 43 and that's chapter and it says
[1:20:16] and there appeared an angel unto him
[1:20:18] from heaven strengthening him he's there
[1:20:20] praying and saying lord if if it if it
[1:20:23] be your will pass this cup from me i
[1:20:25] don't want to die
[1:20:26] i don't want to go through this
[1:20:27] suffering people are going to spit on me
[1:20:29] people are going to yank beard from my
[1:20:31] face i'm sure he's already seen all

[1:20:42] him being god he's saying it's not about
[1:20:44] me

[1:20:48] it's about you
[1:20:50] it's about you it's about you it's about
[1:20:52] me amen that's why he did it amen amen
[1:20:55] and being in agony watch when he was in
[1:20:58] agony three times he went back to pray
[1:21:01] and seeing his disciples sleeping you
[1:21:02] know and he just went back to prayer
[1:21:04] amen
[1:21:05] and then being in agony the bible says
[1:21:07] there he prayed more earnestly right so
[1:21:10] even when more pressure was coming on
[1:21:12] him what did he do the bible says he
[1:21:15] prayed more earnestly
[1:21:18] all right it's not time to slack oh god
[1:21:20] ain't answering my prayer well i'm gonna
[1:21:21] go and watch netflix
