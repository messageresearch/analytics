[19:33] the devil
[19:34] and lord you gave us a healing atonement

[19:38] plead the blood of calvary that you took
[19:41] our
[19:41] stripes for us lord that we don't have
[19:43] to go through this well i pray lord that
[19:45] you would just

[19:49] during the furthermore this service
[19:51] forgive us of our many sins and mistakes
[19:53] that we make against you lord
[19:55] we ask your blessings in jesus name amen
[19:59] oh we need to uh brother colley said he
[20:01] wasn't feeling very good so let's buy
[20:03] our heads again i want
[20:04] he's coming in the door but dear lord we
[20:06] asked you that we were brother calling
[20:08] lord and he said he had some
[20:09] little issues with his stomach lord and
[20:11] cramping and different things lord we
[20:12] pray that in the name of jesus christ
[20:14] when he walks through that door
[20:16] back there just now that they'll be gone
[20:17] lord it's just the devil trying to keep
[20:19] him away from this service lord
[20:20] now we pray in jesus name that you'll
[20:22] condemn that thing lord
[20:24] in jesus name we ask you amen amen come
[20:28] on brother get up here
[20:31] for those of you that don't know brother
[20:32] colley's been with us as long as about
[20:34] as long as this building's been
[20:36] been here so um not saying he's old
[20:41] but he's been here a long time sorry
[20:43] brother dirty too
[20:46] so they're the they're the two they're
[20:47] the two pillars that like tarrant said
[20:49] it just really don't
[20:50] look like a service without them too
[20:51] sitting right there where they're at so
[20:54] we need elders we got we like the young
[20:58] people but we need elders to
[21:00] to tell us you know give us a something
[21:02] to reach for
[21:03] and brother colley and brother darling
[21:04] sure that we'd say that about you if you
[21:06] weren't even here so
[21:07] amen so but christ being coming high
[21:10] priest of good things to come by a
[21:12] greater and more perfect tabernacle
[21:13] we're just family we're just family
[21:15] where's family members and that's what
[21:17] we talk about our family we
[21:18] our natural family probably worse than
[21:20] that but
[21:21] our spiritual family is really really
[21:23] good you okay
[21:24] okay all right all right if he says he's
[21:27] okay he's okay
[21:28] not made with hands that is to say not
[21:30] of this building and neither by the
[21:32] blood of goats and calves but by his own
[21:33] blood he entered him once into the holy
[21:35] place
[21:36] having obtained eternal redemption for
[21:38] us so he had to obtain it
[21:40] like me and you i was sitting and
[21:41] praying for brother colley back in the
[21:43] back i was watching him holding his head
[21:44] and i thought man
[21:45] we have to press through
[21:49] this is the fight it ain't a picnic this
[21:51] is it we got to press through
[21:54] we press ourselves to the mark of the
[21:56] high calling we press ourselves brother
[21:58] you know you look at jesus christ he was
[22:01] the prince of peace right
[22:02] yes he said i don't bring peace
[22:06] but a sword and amen
[22:10] and we must press into the kingdom of
[22:12] god we must use that sword we're not
[22:14] that sword is not going to be
[22:15] set on our side the rest of our life
[22:17] we're going to have to use that sword
[22:18] which is the word of god we know that so
[22:20] in amos 3 verse 7 says surely the lord
[22:23] god will do nothing
[22:24] i hope we see that now we've known for
[22:26] us has been in the message for a while
[22:28] we've known this
[22:29] but it really hits home to me that that
[22:31] you really read this scripture
[22:33] he's just not going to do anything amen
[22:36] unless he reveals it to a prophet first
[22:38] if he can get it to a prophet
[22:40] he can get it to us and man because
[22:42] there had to be somebody to listen
[22:44] to that prophet now there's a lot that
[22:45] do not but there is a group of people
[22:47] that will listen
[22:48] to that prophet because the lion hath
[22:50] lord who will not fear
[22:51] the lord god has spoken who can but
[22:54] prophesy i read revelations 11
[22:56] 3 and i will give power unto my two
[22:58] witnesses and they shall prophesy one
[23:00] thousand
[23:01] two hundred and three score days clothed
[23:03] in
[23:04] sackcloth and you can be seated and
[23:06] we'll read the other one
[23:08] thank sister freda for singing that song
[23:10] she had said she had it there and
[23:12] and about the stars in the hand
[23:16] but the bible tells us the mystery of
[23:17] the seven stars which
[23:19] i saw us in my right hand and the seven
[23:21] golden candlesticks the seven stars were
[23:23] the angels of the seven
[23:24] churches and the seven candlesticks
[23:26] which thou saw us
[23:27] are the seven churches so we're promised
[23:29] these things we know
[23:31] i'm going to fly through this pretty
[23:32] quick so we'll just keep your hand on
[23:34] the button back there because we're
[23:35] going to get to something
[23:37] um but yet this morning i had the
[23:39] background a little bit
[23:41] we had some um i knew there was some
[23:43] that had not been here in a while and
[23:44] they
[23:45] they um we just kind of background a
[23:48] little bit to uh i don't like to leave
[23:50] anybody out i don't like to leave people
[23:52] that come into the service and
[23:53] and don't know what you're talking about
[23:55] at least they get something
[23:56] when you background just a little bit
[23:58] and you know what background helps me
[23:59] too
[24:00] brother dale says sometimes he backs
[24:01] around too much well i don't think he
[24:02] back
[24:03] backgrounds too much i think he
[24:05] background enough to pick up because you
[24:06] know what it's the spirit of god
[24:07] doing the backing up it's not him he's
[24:10] like me he's wanting to just be he's
[24:12] wanting to
[24:12] get to the millennium or get to the
[24:14] future home but but god
[24:16] god knows more than we do so when we
[24:18] yield ourself
[24:19] we go back and and you know they send
[24:23] people in here that are
[24:24] that are i don't say not believers but
[24:26] they just hadn't been through a series
[24:28] or heard
[24:29] what was going on so you kind of have to
[24:30] back up to to pick them up and then slow
[24:33] ones like paul we'd have to do the same
[24:34] thing for him
[24:35] so uh i told you i was going to keep you
[24:38] awake
[24:39] so anyway so now we know that malachi
[24:42] came
[24:43] and restored all things it's okay and
[24:45] restored all things and turn the hearts
[24:47] of the children to the fathers i want us
[24:49] to understand and make sure we realize
[24:51] that
[24:52] it's turning us back
[24:55] it's turning our ideas back to the faith
[24:57] of the fathers
[24:59] not to the old testament not to a
[25:02] pentecostal message
[25:03] pentecost was good we don't throw
[25:07] pentecost out
[25:08] but we're not sitting under a
[25:10] pentecostal message where this one's
[25:11] going to jump up and speak in tongues
[25:12] and this one's going to interpret
[25:14] and you can't even preach so see what
[25:16] did the prophet to god he told even in
[25:18] some of those questions remember
[25:19] the question that that the prophet was
[25:21] covering was on tongues and
[25:23] interpretation well what if one's
[25:24] what if one prophesies what if one
[25:26] speaks in tongues and what if this one
[25:27] doesn't do this what if
[25:29] people were at because you know what
[25:30] they sent in services you served at one
[25:32] brother he said i've heard
[25:33] they get up and just start prophesying
[25:34] it's like popping popcorn they just
[25:36] start getting up and prophesying
[25:37] and you can't preach well see that's not
[25:39] what then brother brown says
[25:41] well the spirit of the prophet subject
[25:42] to the prophet
[25:44] all right well that took care of that
[25:46] and then he said i think last sunday or
[25:48] wednesday night he said
[25:49] now you may have the unction to do what
[25:52] you're doing
[25:53] but you can hold it you can hold it you
[25:57] can hold that
[25:57] and some of y'all's been holding a real
[25:59] long time because we we
[26:00] heard any tongues and interpretations in
[26:02] the church so maybe somebody
[26:04] let loose one day
[26:08] do you do that brother barry's church
[26:11] and i didn't think so
[26:13] now no shame i mean just saying that
[26:15] we're coming to a place though where we
[26:17] may need some of that
[26:18] we may need some of the tongue's
[26:20] interpretations and things like that
[26:22] because it's in the bible it's there for
[26:24] us to use
[26:25] amen and like brother brown said you lay
[26:28] in the you lay under the spout long
[26:29] enough
[26:30] you'll uh you'll begin to do those
[26:32] things
[26:33] but we're heading toward that we're
[26:34] heading towards something that i believe
[26:37] it's marvelous
[26:38] i believe it's something that we're
[26:39] going to press ourselves into
[26:41] and it's not going to be it's not see
[26:42] it's not going to be out of time you can
[26:44] press yourself into something
[26:45] and it'd not be time for it right and
[26:48] see that's what brother brown talks
[26:49] about doing trying to do god a service
[26:51] without it being god's will
[26:52] that's a wonderful message if you want
[26:53] to go listen to it
[26:55] or or read it it's trying to do god and
[26:57] start trying to do a god of service
[26:59] without it being the will of god you'll
[27:00] be out of the will of god
[27:01] so we've got to that's why that when we
[27:03] come up here and in the pulpit and when
[27:05] you're praying during the week
[27:07] they have to coincide they need to
[27:09] coincide
[27:11] with what you're praying for and what
[27:12] the preacher gets up and preaches
[27:14] they need to kind of get together and
[27:16] then it makes them
[27:17] it makes you listening better and it
[27:19] makes me preaching better or whoever's
[27:20] up here in the pulpit
[27:21] all of us come what expecting that god's
[27:24] going to what talk to you not talk to
[27:26] your neighbor but talk to you
[27:29] today you should be the only person
[27:30] sitting in the building because god's
[27:32] going to talk to you he's not he's not
[27:34] where he talks to
[27:35] this great big crowd he talks to
[27:36] individual people that's what we're
[27:37] talking about this
[27:38] this today about the gentiles he speaks
[27:40] to the gentiles
[27:42] sure as nations but he speaks
[27:44] individually by the new birth he speaks
[27:45] to each person individually
[27:47] and then we can have a gift of prophecy
[27:49] a gift of wisdom a gift of healing
[27:51] against all these different gifts
[27:53] of the nine spiritual gifts so if i get
[27:55] started on that i'll never get on this
[27:56] again
[27:57] so so now we look and pull the chart
[27:59] back up if you don't mind
[28:02] we got to a spot this morning that i
[28:04] wanted to get to
[28:06] but if you'll pull that back up
[28:09] and we see that we we talk about the
[28:11] church ages
[28:13] we have a bride we've got seven church
[28:16] ages something's got to happen
[28:18] at the end of that seventh church age
[28:22] because remember it's an event that
[28:25] happens
[28:26] but remember the seventh church age or
[28:29] the time element of the church age goes
[28:31] all the way through the millennium
[28:33] time element time does not cease until
[28:36] the future home
[28:37] all right so we're but we're going to be
[28:39] now that we are eternal people
[28:42] in our soul we must what
[28:45] we must transfer that into this guy
[28:49] because this is the time creature this
[28:50] is stuck in three dimensions this is not
[28:52] a
[28:53] spiritual being that you're looking at
[28:54] right here but you look inside of me is
[28:56] a spiritual being
[28:58] all right same way with you and god's
[28:59] talking to that spiritual being he's
[29:01] changing them first putting that
[29:03] person in heavenly places putting that
[29:06] person
[29:07] in actually not in this dimension amen
[29:12] your soul by the new birth has been
[29:13] raptured into heavenly places that
[29:15] you've already been raptured
[29:17] because you've been caught up but we're
[29:19] now we're waiting on what
[29:21] to wit the redemption of this body
[29:24] according to romans 8.
[29:25] but that didn't have that couldn't
[29:27] happen in any other church age because
[29:28] like i said this morning
[29:30] they were all upright operating under a
[29:32] closed book even
[29:33] even john saw the thunders but couldn't
[29:35] write them
[29:37] he just wrote the symbols he wrote just
[29:40] the symbols of the seals
[29:43] right jesus preached them in matthew 24
[29:47] we didn't know that until the prophet of
[29:50] god came
[29:51] and the book became open and went once
[29:52] the book became open he preached the
[29:54] seals to us
[29:55] and then he takes us back to matthew 24
[29:57] he said jesus has already preached them
[30:01] all right now we nobody ever knew that
[30:03] scholars didn't know that
[30:05] because the book was closed well now the
[30:06] book has been closed down through church
[30:08] ages
[30:09] now it has been open because of the
[30:12] ministry of what we were talking about
[30:14] this morning
[30:15] let's go to luke 17 verse 24
[30:19] for the lightning that lighteth out of
[30:20] the one part of the earth or heaven
[30:22] shineth on the other part under heaven
[30:24] i'll let them get to it so shall
[30:26] although the son of man be in his day so
[30:28] we've got to see a son of man ministry
[30:30] come here and because he was through the
[30:32] seven church ages but right at the end
[30:35] now remember you and i are in that space
[30:39] of time right now
[30:41] of of trying to realize and and i don't
[30:44] say figure out because you can't figure
[30:46] out god
[30:46] but to realize that we're looking at
[30:48] judgment
[30:50] if we're not born again but we're also
[30:53] looking at we're all going to die
[30:54] physically if something doesn't happen
[30:58] according to luke 17 verse 24 going down
[31:00] to 26 as it was in the days of noah
[31:03] so shall be also on the days of the son
[31:04] of man then verse 30 said even thus
[31:06] shall it be in the day when the son of
[31:08] man is revealed
[31:09] it's always before destruction that the
[31:11] son of man comes on the scene
[31:13] and is being revealed all right so he's
[31:16] come
[31:17] not in the first church age first three
[31:18] four five six but in the seventh church
[31:21] age
[31:21] we had a prophet of god come restored us
[31:24] back
[31:25] to the faith of the fathers and
[31:28] then preached the opening of the seals
[31:31] the opening of the thunders and all the
[31:33] deep deep mysteries of god
[31:35] that's in the bible
[31:38] not out of the bible it's in the bible
[31:41] for you to read
[31:43] it's just sometimes we read the letter
[31:45] of the word
[31:46] and don't get the spirit of the word
[31:48] amen and that's what happened to man
[31:50] when they had all these other different
[31:51] denominational ideas
[31:53] is everybody okay with that but now
[31:56] remember when
[31:57] brother branham came on earth and he
[32:00] started his ministry it was in a healing
[32:02] process
[32:03] but remember he said that was just to
[32:05] catch the eye of the believer
[32:08] not in the years of preparation not in
[32:10] the healing ministry
[32:11] because listen that's not gonna change
[32:13] your body now it may temporarily give
[32:15] you a healing
[32:16] you go through the prayer line you get a
[32:18] temporary healing and then you might get
[32:19] sick brother abraham so you can get
[32:20] healed today
[32:21] and get sick tomorrow the same thing
[32:23] amen because it's a temporary
[32:26] healing it's not totally all the way
[32:30] a full resurrection let's just say it
[32:32] that way so when he when the prophet of
[32:33] god came on earth
[32:35] and he would tell the people their
[32:36] problems he would tell them where
[32:37] they've been tell them where they're
[32:38] going
[32:39] and tell them what's happening in their
[32:41] life oh i see you're a christian because
[32:43] you have a familiar spirit or i see this
[32:45] he was he was
[32:46] looking at the soul of the individual
[32:50] because he had to see where they'd been
[32:53] because he even had to see their
[32:54] thoughts sometimes he said oh you're
[32:55] thinking about a son
[32:57] you're thinking about your husband
[32:58] you're thinking about your wife
[33:00] he was right down in the deep part of
[33:02] the person
[33:03] and listen that's what's happening today
[33:05] if you'll let god
[33:06] talk to you
[33:09] not that william branham's here not that
[33:11] but the prophetic
[33:12] utterance that he left us because
[33:14] remember he told us we're prophetic
[33:15] people
[33:17] and we only are going to hear prophetic
[33:19] things
[33:21] amen little messiahs messiahs he made us
[33:23] so close
[33:25] but do we really believe that you better
[33:27] believe it because that's what this
[33:28] message
[33:29] this message is not here for the healing
[33:30] campaign there's been healing since the
[33:33] beginning of time
[33:35] but there's never been a body change
[33:37] like me and you are going to
[33:38] take it in a church age does everybody
[33:40] understand what i'm talking about enoch
[33:41] took a body change
[33:44] that that wasn't under a church age i'm
[33:46] talking about inside that church age
[33:48] somebody's going to stand on the earth
[33:50] as the prophet tells us
[33:52] and death is going to crawl up their
[33:53] sleeve and they're going to just wipe it
[33:55] right back off
[33:56] now when that happens the dead christ
[33:59] are going to rise
[34:01] because there's nothing to hold them the
[34:03] reason they don't come back into this
[34:05] time period it's like i've told you many
[34:07] times before
[34:08] why would you be in the sixth dimension
[34:11] eternal no taxes
[34:15] don't have to go to work on monday yeah
[34:18] hallelujah for those of y'all that work
[34:20] those y'all that don't you can remember
[34:22] that
[34:24] monday morning was always tough yeah
[34:25] monday's tough at the post office too
[34:27] because y'all's
[34:28] bills come in on sunday and we have to
[34:30] deliver them on monday
[34:31] but they don't have to worry about
[34:32] things like that some of you laugh
[34:34] because you have
[34:35] never mind so anyway they're in the
[34:37] sixth dimension why would they want to
[34:38] come back here
[34:41] why why come back into this miserable
[34:44] world
[34:46] well because one day they're going to
[34:49] feel a pull
[34:51] and that pull is going to bring them
[34:53] into this dimension because somebody's
[34:55] standing in this dimension that death
[34:57] has been destroyed from
[34:58] [Music]
[34:59] now you can take that as a fairy tale
[35:01] you can take out whatever you want but
[35:02] there will be someone
[35:05] that will not be part of a resurrection
[35:07] they will be the alive
[35:08] and remain everybody got that say amen
[35:13] first thessalonians 4 verse 13 if you'll
[35:15] pull that up please that's where we'll
[35:16] start
[35:17] but i would not have you ignorant
[35:18] brethren concerning them which are
[35:20] asleep
[35:21] asleep they're not dead they're more
[35:23] alive now than they've ever been
[35:27] that you saw not even as others which
[35:29] have no hope
[35:30] for if we believe that jesus died and
[35:32] rose again even so them also which sleep
[35:34] in jesus will god bring with him
[35:36] for this we say unto you by the word of
[35:38] the lord so in other words it's pretty
[35:40] it's been confirmed that we which are
[35:43] alive
[35:45] and remain now as paul was writing this
[35:48] he was part of the alive
[35:52] but now when he died
[35:55] he became part of that then with us are
[35:57] asleep
[36:00] so alive and remain unto the coming of
[36:02] the lord now when was the coming of the
[36:03] lord it's now
[36:05] i'm not talking about now remember they
[36:06] all oh the coming lord was 1963.
[36:09] now the coming of the lord started when
[36:11] you got born again whatever day that was
[36:13] it's going to culminate like i said
[36:15] before we're not looking for a rapture
[36:21] rapture rapture rapture rapture well
[36:23] it's not just going to we're going to
[36:24] pull up and go in the rapture
[36:27] right we've got to have a resurrection
[36:30] first
[36:31] we've got to have a body change next
[36:33] then we're going to take a rapture
[36:34] rapture is a culmination of all those
[36:37] things happening
[36:39] so what do we need to we need to we need
[36:41] to hone all of our efforts
[36:44] into getting the dead folks into this
[36:46] dimension because that's been destroyed
[36:47] in this dimension
[36:49] and you say i can't do that well we'll
[36:51] do your funeral
[36:53] and we may have to you might have to do
[36:55] mine but somebody
[36:58] is going to stand on this earth
[37:00] according to the bible
[37:02] and according to god sending us a
[37:04] prophet because he's not going to do
[37:05] anything
[37:06] until he sends us a profit so he's
[37:09] already sent that prophet
[37:10] we're ahead of the game buddy he's
[37:13] already sent us that prophet
[37:14] that prophet told us what was going to
[37:16] happen the bible's already told it was
[37:18] going to told us what's going to happen
[37:20] and it's in this time period
[37:23] that holds it way down the honing of the
[37:26] bride knowing who she is and what she's
[37:28] doing here
[37:29] not that we're gonna die by and by no
[37:31] somebody's gonna stay alive
[37:33] somebody's not gonna be a part of that
[37:36] having to go
[37:37] to sleep i don't want to say die but
[37:39] asleep for the lord himself shall
[37:41] descend from heaven with a shout
[37:43] and the denominational world they're
[37:45] looking for hey
[37:48] they're looking for they're looking for
[37:50] an angel with wings
[37:52] usually girl angels ain't no girl angel
[37:57] who had to tell us that the prophet
[38:01] so if you believe one you've got to
[38:02] believe that one there's no there's no
[38:04] angels you know there was cherubs in the
[38:06] old testament that had wings right
[38:08] in ezekiel that was cherubims but
[38:11] regular angels don't have wings why they
[38:12] need wings for
[38:14] oh so they can fly yeah right so anyway
[38:17] that's this old wives tale that's what
[38:19] your mama told you your grandma told you
[38:22] that's what the world writes in a little
[38:23] book for you to read you know and it
[38:25] sounds so sweet and really nice
[38:27] that you got an angel there with wings
[38:28] you know
[38:31] but what is the shout the voice of the
[38:32] arcane we know that the prophet that god
[38:34] told us to shout was the message
[38:37] and the voice of the angel was the voice
[38:39] of the archangel the resurrection
[38:42] and with the trump of god we've heard
[38:44] not
[38:46] we've heard all this and the world's
[38:49] looking for it
[38:51] that's why this carry catching away is
[38:53] going to be so secret
[38:54] it's going to happen so quick they're
[38:56] not even going to know anything about it
[39:00] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[39:03] then we which are alive and remain shall
[39:06] be caught up
[39:06] there's the rapture will be caught up
[39:10] after the culmination of what
[39:12] change won't prevent them that get
[39:15] come up out of the ground the
[39:16] resurrection we'll read the next
[39:17] scripture talk about
[39:19] together we're going to be changed and
[39:20] caught up in the air be in the clouds to
[39:22] meet the lord
[39:24] wherefore comfort one another with these
[39:25] words so let's read the next one
[39:29] behold i what show you a mystery
[39:34] it's so much a mystery nobody knows
[39:35] about it but the bride
[39:37] god sent the message to the bride
[39:42] not to the church they have a message
[39:45] they say they're going to go through the
[39:46] tribulation they say they've got to
[39:48] stand before the
[39:49] for the white throne judgment right
[39:52] we're not
[39:53] that's not him in the bible but he took
[39:55] a prophet
[39:56] to tell us these things behold i show
[40:00] you a mystery
[40:00] we shall not all sleep but we shall be
[40:04] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[40:06] an eye look at the last trump
[40:08] for the trumpet shall sound what is a
[40:09] trumpet it's what a message
[40:12] yes it's something that is
[40:17] unique to you and me
[40:20] amen because there's all kind of sounds
[40:22] everywhere else
[40:24] what if you were on the battlefield back
[40:25] in the 1800s 1400s when they had no
[40:27] communication with
[40:29] with cell phones or anything like that
[40:31] they
[40:32] could be fighting one mile away
[40:36] and how in the world you're going to by
[40:37] the time you rode over there
[40:40] you'd have some disaster going on but if
[40:42] you had one guy with a strong voice
[40:45] and that trumpet made a certain sound
[40:47] and he hit that note
[40:49] they knew either the charge or to
[40:50] retreat and that's the same thing with
[40:52] me and you folks we've got to hear
[40:54] the certain sound of this message of the
[40:58] hour
[40:59] not all the other sounds that you hear
[41:02] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[41:03] shall be raised
[41:05] incorruptible like i said last week pay
[41:08] attention to that
[41:08] because remember it had to be
[41:11] corruptible
[41:13] before it can be incorruptible
[41:17] and it shall be raised incorruptible
[41:22] people in the message believe you know
[41:23] or people in the world believe that
[41:25] that this one's never going to show back
[41:27] up again that we're just going to get a
[41:29] brand new one
[41:31] well that ain't true according to that
[41:34] now listen this won't be made new
[41:37] got it but it's going to be the same you
[41:43] that's redemption redemption is not
[41:45] replacement replacement is getting a new
[41:47] one
[41:48] but redemption is what bringing up that
[41:51] which had fallen
[41:54] and you can't be unless you this has got
[41:56] to connect
[41:58] or it should have said and the dead
[42:00] shall be raised with a brand new body
[42:04] it says raised incorruptable
[42:07] for this corruptable must put on
[42:10] incorruption in other words you're
[42:12] connected to it yes
[42:14] in other words it would just say well
[42:16] we're just going to go the store and buy
[42:17] another one
[42:18] right it's not you're connected and look
[42:22] aren't we mortal now you're mortal this
[42:26] mortal
[42:26] must put on immortality
[42:32] we shall be changed
[42:36] right here in this vile thing that your
[42:39] mama and daddy brought and it's dying
[42:42] even the ones that have already passed
[42:43] on they're going to bring
[42:46] their body up and it's going to be
[42:49] changed
[42:51] okay and it'll be new man
[42:54] 20 years old well some of your 20 year
[42:57] olds are rolling your eyes
[42:59] but but but that's that are a lot older
[43:01] than that
[43:02] yeah i'm looking forward to that part
[43:06] i was telling them ladies i'm i'm 61
[43:08] years old and y'all are
[43:09] 12 and 14. so y'all we
[43:12] you'd really not i hope you drove did

[43:21] well body change you know
[43:22] i'm i'm feeling pretty good you where
[43:24] did you get my age you got all these
[43:25] other brothers
[43:26] and sisters get a little bit older we
[43:27] are looking for a body change
[43:31] we are looking for a body change because
[43:34] it it has to be a total resurrection for
[43:36] us to get out of the bed in the morning
[43:40] right feet get up
[43:44] we get up in shifts now but now listen
[43:47] on that resurrection morning that won't
[43:48] happen
[43:50] boy what a youth camp and it'll be a
[43:53] permanent one
[43:54] it won't be one that you go to and come
[43:55] back from no
[43:57] we'll all be young amen amen for this
[43:59] corruptable must
[44:01] put on incorruption and this mortal
[44:04] must put on immortality he's telling us
[44:07] what we must
[44:08] do they'll be okay with that so the dead
[44:12] in christ shall rise in corruptable we
[44:13] shall be changed so
[44:15] what are we looking for first
[44:16] resurrection
[44:18] we're looking for death to be destroyed
[44:20] in a group of people
[44:21] in this time element in this dimension
[44:25] and that's going to draw them out of
[44:27] that sixth dimension which will be a
[44:29] resurrection
[44:30] not only of us brothers and sisters but
[44:33] every saint from
[44:34] paul all the way to right here
[44:38] boy what a draw you talking about a
[44:39] third pole everybody won't see a third
[44:41] pole that'll be the biggest pool you've
[44:42] ever seen in your life
[44:44] when all them dimensions started
[44:45] emptying up and the devil's going where
[44:47] they going
[44:49] no the devil's going where they been
[44:51] because see he can't get in the sixth
[44:53] dimension
[44:54] that's one place he can't deal with he
[44:56] can go talk to god for some reason in
[44:58] the seventh dimension he can go talk to
[45:00] god
[45:00] but in the sixth dimension he don't mess
[45:03] in that
[45:04] that ain't here that's just god's kids
[45:06] and god's kids alone
[45:08] what a mighty god we serve if brother
[45:10] johnny was here sister johnny was here
[45:12] she said what a mighty god we serve
[45:14] amen let's go what he preserved us
[45:18] even even in our inadequacy and even in
[45:20] our corrupt ability and all the
[45:22] different things that we are
[45:23] he's preserved us yes he's preserving if
[45:26] they pass on he's got them
[45:28] standing there waiting brother brown did
[45:30] not see dead corpse when he went to the
[45:31] sixth dimension
[45:32] he saw people that were happy people
[45:34] that were in the what the prime of life
[45:38] why are we why do we ever get afraid
[45:41] folks
[45:42] the only thing you better be afraid of
[45:44] is having a new birth or not having it
[45:47] amen so now we're looking for
[45:49] resurrection
[45:50] we're looking for then when the
[45:52] resurrection happens we're looking for a
[45:53] body change because remember
[45:54] we get changed after go back
[45:58] go back to 51. there you go behold i
[46:01] show you a mystery
[46:02] we shall not all sleep but we shall be
[46:04] changed in the moment twinkling
[46:05] of an eye and the dead shall be raised
[46:07] incorruptible
[46:08] and we shall be changed so the dead's
[46:11] got to come out of the ground even
[46:12] though standing here looking old
[46:15] but that voice of the resurrection is
[46:17] not old
[46:19] but when we're raised then what happens
[46:21] the prophet of god thank god for a
[46:22] prophet
[46:23] he said we'll be around here 30 or 40
[46:25] days right
[46:27] like the lord jesus was 30-40 days and
[46:29] then we're going to be caught up which
[46:31] is the rapture
[46:33] after the resurrection after we get
[46:35] changed then we're going to have
[46:37] a culmination or a rapture or as the
[46:40] rapture
[46:41] the word rapture means ecstasy or or
[46:43] pinnacle or
[46:44] or you know something way up here that's
[46:46] going to happen because all these other
[46:48] things have happened
[46:49] right so that's why this
[46:52] you know us at the church we don't
[46:53] scream rapture rapture rapture no
[46:55] we need the voice of the resurrection
[46:58] somebody's going to have to preach the
[46:59] voice of the resurrection first
[47:02] then we shall be changed then we shall
[47:04] be caught up
[47:05] like in revelations 4 1 watch this
[47:08] excuse me revelations 4 1
[47:12] after this after the church ages
[47:15] after everything's happened i looked and
[47:18] behold the door was opened in heaven
[47:20] thank god for the open door i had to
[47:23] have an open book before we have an open
[47:24] door
[47:25] and the first voice which i heard was
[47:27] that we're a trumpet see there's a
[47:29] they you see trumpet everywhere it's not
[47:32] that's not confusing that's a voice
[47:34] talking with me saying come up hither
[47:37] and i will
[47:38] show these things which must be
[47:39] hereafter and immediately i was in the
[47:41] spirit and behold the throne was set in
[47:42] heaven
[47:43] and one sat on the throne now that's to
[47:46] me that's truly we know that's the
[47:48] rapture of the church
[47:49] now after the church is raptured
[47:52] then god is going to go shift to the
[47:56] jews right
[47:58] we were covering that a little bit last
[47:59] week according to
[48:01] revelations 11 there's going to be two
[48:03] prophets come on the scene
[48:05] now but we need to talk about this first
[48:07] we need to look and see
[48:08] who goes in the rapture so let's go to
[48:11] matthew verse 25
[48:13] and cover this right here
[48:16] there's wise virgins and foolish virgins
[48:19] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[48:20] locking up to 10 virgins
[48:22] which took their lamps and went forth to
[48:25] meet the bridegroom
[48:27] now look they all 10 was looking for a
[48:30] bridegroom
[48:31] all right five of them weren't looking
[48:33] for a bridegroom and five not no all ten
[48:35] were looking for a bridegroom
[48:37] all right and five of them were wise
[48:41] and five of them were foolish now why
[48:43] were the five wives they had oil the
[48:45] five foolish ones did not that's we're
[48:47] going to get to that story
[48:48] they that were foolish took their lamps
[48:51] and took no oil now what's oil
[48:52] oil is a type of the holy ghost all
[48:55] right
[48:56] they that were foolish took their land
[48:58] and they were in the words they took
[48:59] everything they needed except one thing
[49:02] one critical part was what
[49:06] what was it they had oil that's like a
[49:10] car with no gas
[49:11] useless but they had it
[49:15] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[49:18] with their lamps
[49:20] while the bridegroom tarried they all
[49:23] slumbered and slept
[49:26] then all listen all ten arose at the
[49:30] same time
[49:33] they heard the same voice
[49:36] they didn't hear a different voice they
[49:38] all ten heard the same
[49:40] voice
[49:43] and at midnight there was a cry made
[49:46] behold the bridegroom
[49:48] cometh go ye out to meet him
[49:52] in other words there was a cry or a
[49:54] message went forth
[49:56] told you what the bridegroom was saying
[50:00] go you out to me go you got to do
[50:03] something
[50:03] go to meet him then all those virgins
[50:07] arose and trimmed their lamps
[50:16] let me say a little bit about that
[50:20] they all wore their hair right
[50:23] and the dress right went to church
[50:27] listened to tape read the books
[50:31] watched the preacher prayed
[50:35] they trimmed their lamps they were
[50:36] getting ready to do something
[50:39] the foolish said unto the wise
[50:43] we missed one spot
[50:46] give us of your oil for our lamps are
[50:50] gone out
[50:52] they run out of oil they were justified
[50:56] they were sanctified because sanctified
[50:58] what cleaned and set aside for service
[51:00] they cleaned trimmed the lamp
[51:01] they cleaned everything up but they did
[51:03] not go on to receive the holy ghost
[51:06] now you know as well as i do that as
[51:10] brother richard was
[51:11] preaching sunday most of your foolish
[51:14] virgins are going to come out of this
[51:15] message
[51:17] because they're virgins they're not
[51:19] contaminated with that denominational
[51:21] stuff
[51:22] out there
[51:25] but what happened they said in a message
[51:28] church where the pastor told them well
[51:30] just believe that brother brown was a
[51:31] prophet and all you got to do is
[51:32] you know read one book and listen to two
[51:34] tapes a week and you're fine
[51:38] because they're foolish they had to be
[51:41] led by somebody that was foolish
[51:47] that's why i tell you we teach the
[51:49] baptism of the holy ghost in three
[51:51] stages
[51:52] you've got to be justified you've got to
[51:54] be sanctified a definite work of
[51:56] sanctification justification because you
[51:58] know what sanctification is
[51:59] sanctification makes you feel good makes
[52:01] you want to go to church
[52:03] the unclean spirit's gone out right
[52:05] according to luke
[52:06] the unclean spirit has left you
[52:10] and you're feeling good you're feeling
[52:12] religious
[52:14] you try to stay awake during the service
[52:18] i said try some don't try
[52:26] but you understand what i mean
[52:29] they're virgins though they think
[52:31] they've got it
[52:33] and they are clean as they can be
[52:37] right because they're foolish for their
[52:39] virgins
[52:41] but the wise have went on to purchase
[52:43] the oil
[52:47] i said purchase yeah you got to purchase
[52:49] the oil you got to want it more than the
[52:51] next guy besides you wants it
[52:54] you got to want it more than the store
[52:56] you get it from got it
[52:58] but listen that storeroom will never run
[53:00] out of oil
[53:03] the baptism of my holy ghost is for
[53:04] everybody
[53:06] it's just the ones that want it and the
[53:08] ones that don't give us your oil
[53:11] for our lamps are gone out
[53:14] we've tried to live this thing we've
[53:16] tried to not do this
[53:18] we've tried to not do that and that's
[53:21] your problem
[53:23] you tried to not do this and you tried
[53:25] you you took that one word
[53:28] and you took yourself out you tried
[53:32] let god do it because when that unclean
[53:35] spirit goes out of you
[53:37] walks in dry places seek his wrath find
[53:39] us none he's gonna come right back into
[53:42] your house and the bible doesn't say us
[53:44] even your house it says it's his house
[53:48] and finding it swept and garnished the
[53:51] tv's going out the door the
[53:52] dresses are down the men's not drinking
[53:54] and smoking he sees all that and he says
[53:57] hmm i think i'll give them a religious
[54:00] spirit
[54:02] if they want to go to church i'll let
[54:03] them go to church if they want to if
[54:04] they want to be a message believer go
[54:05] right ahead that's okay
[54:06] press play all you want to
[54:12] not according to the bible though
[54:13] they're not going all the way they're
[54:14] doing some of it
[54:17] they're doing some of it but the bible
[54:20] says in ephesians that he gave
[54:22] apostles prophets pastors teachers
[54:23] evangelists for what they're perfecting
[54:27] knowing how to get your oil right
[54:30] and keep it lit so it won't go out
[54:33] amen but the wise answer is saying not
[54:36] so
[54:37] you've been sitting in church 13 14
[54:39] years what's your problem
[54:41] lest there be not enough for us in you
[54:45] listen it's a personal experience with
[54:47] god you want to give the new birth to
[54:48] everybody you can
[54:49] but you can't give it to everybody that
[54:51] don't want it
[54:54] tell them and tell them and tell them
[54:56] lest there be not enough for us
[54:57] and you but go you rather to them that
[54:59] sell
[55:02] find you somebody that's got some oil
[55:05] that can sell it to you
[55:06] and buy it for yourselves and while they
[55:09] went to buy
[55:11] the bridegroom came and they that were
[55:13] ready went in with him to the marriage
[55:15] and the door was shut
[55:18] remember that door was opened in heaven
[55:19] in revelations 4 they went up through
[55:21] the door
[55:23] well who shut the door on the ark god
[55:26] shut the door on the ark
[55:28] so god's going to shut the door on the
[55:29] gentile dispensation
[55:31] and these that were left out
[55:35] afterwards came the other virgin saying
[55:37] lord lord open to us
[55:38] but he answered and said verily i say
[55:40] unto you i know you're not
[55:43] watch therefore for you know neither the
[55:44] day nor the hour
[55:47] wherein the son of man cometh you see
[55:50] the dispensation he didn't say son of
[55:51] god
[55:52] he said the son of man dispensation is
[55:54] when this is going to all happen
[55:57] so if you don't get in that dispensation
[55:59] then you're going to be left
[56:01] everybody okay with that may be strong
[56:03] but you know what i'm sorry
[56:07] let's go to the can y'all pull up the 70
[56:09] weeks of daniel's chart
[56:12] y'all stay with me today i know it's a
[56:13] little warm in here i had a cheeseburger
[56:16] today i'm okay
[56:20] all right let's go yeah there you go
[56:22] let's go to right here
[56:24] i know that look don't worry about
[56:25] brother bob just fill this thing full of
[56:26] good stuff and if you want one of them i
[56:28] guess they can send you one but brother
[56:30] bob just
[56:31] we just kept adding stuff it wasn't
[56:32] brother bob's fault but he just wanted
[56:34] to put this chart together
[56:35] but we're right here in the last church
[56:36] age right so what's going to happen is
[56:39] that we are going to
[56:41] take a rapture or a catching away
[56:45] or a wise virgin is going to leave this
[56:48] place
[56:50] and then what's going to happen is god's
[56:52] going to start dealing
[56:54] with the jews right i'm going to slow
[56:57] down just a minute god's gonna start
[56:58] dealing with the jews
[56:59] but he's not gonna ever deal with
[57:01] gentiles again
[57:04] got it the one i just read you here the
[57:07] wise virgin were all
[57:09] that was a gentile bride even the
[57:11] foolish virgin but remember they weren't
[57:13] bright they didn't get married because
[57:16] they didn't go with the bridegroom the
[57:17] bridegroom called
[57:19] but they someway did not become bride
[57:22] because they never were married because
[57:24] he said i knew you not
[57:26] everybody okay with that all right so
[57:28] now what's going to happen is is we're
[57:30] going to be caught up
[57:32] into another dimension and it's not so
[57:34] much up we're just going to step over
[57:35] into a faster dimension
[57:38] amen because that's where they're at now
[57:42] they're in a faster dimension okay the
[57:44] ones that went on
[57:46] they're going to come back into this
[57:47] dimension and then according to this
[57:49] chart
[57:50] according to the other chart two when we
[57:52] take a rapture
[57:53] then what happens is
[57:56] the tribulation is going to start the
[57:58] wrath of god is going to start on the
[58:00] world
[58:01] because it's a gentile world so god's
[58:04] going to start the tribulation on them
[58:06] first
[58:09] not the jews yet because he's got to go
[58:11] over there to the jews
[58:12] and he's got to preach to them three and
[58:14] a half years
[58:17] before the battle of armageddon he's got
[58:18] to preach three and a half years
[58:20] about 1260 days through the two prophets
[58:23] he's got to preach to them
[58:25] and while he preaches to them you and i
[58:28] are enjoying a marriage supper of three
[58:30] and a half years
[58:31] you know don't get tired of what we're
[58:33] gonna eat or where we're gonna be okay
[58:34] just please make it
[58:38] the menu will be given to you when you
[58:40] need it
[58:43] anyway matthew 24 verse 21 sometimes we
[58:46] get hung up on some things like that but
[58:47] i
[58:48] it doesn't matter to me we can have
[58:49] we're gonna have communion today maybe
[58:50] we'll just have communion for three and
[58:52] a half years
[58:52] it doesn't matter all right let's go to
[58:54] matthew 24
[58:56] for then shall be great tribulation such
[58:59] as was not since the beginning of the
[59:00] world
[59:01] to this time now this is matthew 24
[59:03] jesus is just getting finished preaching
[59:05] the seals
[59:06] hello matthew 24 you see all this 24 all
[59:10] the way through
[59:12] such as was not since the beginning of
[59:14] the world to this time
[59:16] no nor ever shall be and except those
[59:18] days should be shortened
[59:20] there should be no flesh saved but for
[59:21] the elect sake
[59:25] that's me and you those days
[59:28] shall be shortened all right let's go to
[59:30] revelations 2 verse 20.
[59:32] see notwithstanding i have a few things
[59:34] against thee because thou suffereth that
[59:36] woman jezebel
[59:37] which calleth herself a prophetess to
[59:40] teach and seduce my servants to commit
[59:42] fornication
[59:43] now he's not talking about natural this
[59:46] is spiritual fornication
[59:48] everybody got that
[59:52] and seduce my servants with to commit
[59:55] fornication and to eat things sacrificed
[59:57] unto idols
[59:58] and i give her a space to repent now
[1:00:00] this is in the church ages but what it's
[1:00:01] what he's prophesying
[1:00:03] and she repented not
[1:00:06] behold i will cast her into a bed and
[1:00:09] then that commit adultery with her
[1:00:11] we're not talking about natural adultery
[1:00:13] we're talking about spiritual adultery
[1:00:14] we're talking about denominational ideas
[1:00:16] we're talking about
[1:00:16] something that's contrary to the word of
[1:00:18] god amen
[1:00:22] caster that commit adultery with her
[1:00:23] into great tribulation
[1:00:26] except they repent of their deeds and we
[1:00:28] know that they do not all right
[1:00:30] matthew 17 because look when you say
[1:00:32] great tribulation
[1:00:35] listen tribulation worketh patience and
[1:00:37] we have tribulation in our own life
[1:00:39] but you will not ever go through the
[1:00:40] great tribulation because the great
[1:00:42] tribulation is the wrath of god
[1:00:45] and it will be because there's no listen
[1:00:47] what's keeping this world alive right
[1:00:49] now is the holy ghost that's inside you
[1:00:52] what's keeping this world halfway no
[1:00:55] attempt of sanity because the other nine
[1:00:58] tenths is not
[1:00:59] the tenth of sanity that's left what's
[1:01:02] not letting this world break into
[1:01:04] create into chaos is you and me
[1:01:09] because the holy ghost is on the earth
[1:01:10] protecting the bride but when she leaves
[1:01:14] there's only going to be 144 000 people
[1:01:17] that are born again everybody else is
[1:01:18] going to be what
[1:01:19] they're going to worship the beast
[1:01:23] whoa that's why you don't want to be
[1:01:26] here
[1:01:27] that's why i see the bride don't the
[1:01:29] bride don't go through that
[1:01:31] the church will because the church only
[1:01:33] went so far and didn't take the full
[1:01:34] word of god
[1:01:36] but the bride why would you let your
[1:01:38] bride go through tribulation
[1:01:40] oh we're going to wedding supper we're
[1:01:41] going to we're going to take you over to
[1:01:43] germany and put you in a concentration
[1:01:45] camp for our honeymoon
[1:01:47] now that would be a horrible husband
[1:01:49] right
[1:01:50] yeah god's not going to do that he's
[1:01:53] going to rapture us out of here
[1:01:54] and then he's going to let like i said
[1:01:56] all hell break loose here on earth
[1:01:58] amen because there's nothing to hold it
[1:02:00] back there's nothing to hold back the
[1:02:01] wrath of god except me and you sitting
[1:02:03] here today and all the bride around the
[1:02:04] world
[1:02:05] and after six days jesus took peter
[1:02:07] james and john his brother
[1:02:08] and bringeth him up into a high mountain
[1:02:10] apart and was transfigured before them
[1:02:11] his face did shine as the sun
[1:02:13] his rainbow was white as the light and
[1:02:15] behold there appearing to him moses and
[1:02:17] elias
[1:02:18] talking with him brother i'm talking
[1:02:19] about the second coming because dare
[1:02:21] stood jesus the second coming of christ
[1:02:23] and there goes there stands the two
[1:02:25] witnesses that he's going to let them go
[1:02:27] to israel
[1:02:29] and do what he's going to take the
[1:02:32] veil off of the eyes of the
[1:02:36] jews so that they'll accept because see
[1:02:38] they already they're already looking for
[1:02:40] this guy
[1:02:42] they asked jesus why must the last first
[1:02:44] come well malachi 4 says he got to come
[1:02:46] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:02:47] lord the only problem is is they miss
[1:02:48] them comings of elijah so god's going to
[1:02:51] send them the spirit of elijah
[1:02:53] and they'll give them a bonus they're
[1:02:54] going to send moses over there and
[1:02:56] they're going to call 144 000. let's go
[1:02:58] to revelations 11
[1:02:59] 3 and i will give power unto my two
[1:03:02] witnesses
[1:03:03] and they shall prophesy a thousand two
[1:03:06] hundred and three score days clothed in
[1:03:07] sackcloth
[1:03:08] these are the two olive trees and the
[1:03:10] two candlesticks standing before the god
[1:03:11] of the earth
[1:03:12] and if any man hurt them fire now look
[1:03:14] fire they're not going to be like a
[1:03:16] flamethrower
[1:03:19] it's going to be the word that they
[1:03:20] preach
[1:03:22] and that's what's happening now flame of
[1:03:24] fire
[1:03:26] every time you hear the inspired word of
[1:03:27] god it's a flame of fire because what
[1:03:29] does it do it burns out what you've got
[1:03:30] problems with
[1:03:34] doesn't do anything to the outside
[1:03:36] person
[1:03:37] doesn't burn you on the outside burns
[1:03:40] your me on the inside
[1:03:42] and when i get burned on the inside it
[1:03:43] just makes the outside guy do the right
[1:03:45] thing
[1:03:45] that's just really simple and if any man
[1:03:48] will hurt them fire because see they got
[1:03:49] the holy ghost
[1:03:52] god's not going to send two prophets
[1:03:54] over there without the holy ghost
[1:03:55] amen so they're going to have the
[1:03:57] baptism of the holy ghost but now
[1:03:58] remember
[1:04:01] remember position they'll not be bribed
[1:04:05] god is going to promise to go pick up
[1:04:07] that 144
[1:04:08] 000 because he promised never to forget
[1:04:12] israel he's not going to leave her here
[1:04:15] he's going to give her that space of
[1:04:18] three and a half years
[1:04:20] listen thank god he didn't give us just
[1:04:22] three and a half years because we'd be
[1:04:23] so far behind
[1:04:24] how many years you've been here
[1:04:28] what if you just took the first three
[1:04:29] and a half years you were here
[1:04:32] we'd be here still i mean still
[1:04:35] next time in the next year and the next
[1:04:37] year and the next year but she's only
[1:04:38] going to give them three and a half
[1:04:40] years and they're gonna so
[1:04:43] know what's going on watch they have
[1:04:45] power to shut the heaven that it rained
[1:04:46] not in the days of their prophecy
[1:04:48] we know that's elijah have power over
[1:04:50] water turn them to blood and smite the
[1:04:52] earth with all plagues as often as he
[1:04:53] will we're going to read the sixth seal
[1:04:54] in a minute because brother brown tells
[1:04:56] us about the two prophets in the sixth
[1:04:57] seal
[1:04:58] when they shall have finished their
[1:04:59] testimony
[1:05:02] the beast is what the beast is going to
[1:05:04] pop up and kill them both
[1:05:07] there's going to be a special anointing
[1:05:09] on them because of the word of god for
[1:05:10] 1260 days
[1:05:12] they're going to prophesy nothing can
[1:05:13] touch them
[1:05:15] not a person not a man not an atomic
[1:05:17] bomb nothing can touch those two
[1:05:20] prophets
[1:05:22] i want a little bit of that anointing
[1:05:24] right now
[1:05:26] i want i don't want i don't want them to
[1:05:28] have it all i'd like to have a little
[1:05:29] bit of that now
[1:05:32] and when they shout and you too you
[1:05:34] should have it keep you awake
[1:05:38] and it's going to he's going to kill him
[1:05:41] so now let's go to
[1:05:44] daniel 12 7. i heard the man clothed in
[1:05:47] london which was upon the waters of the
[1:05:48] river when he had held up his hand right
[1:05:50] hand in his left hand
[1:05:52] he swear by him that liveth forever like
[1:05:54] i said wednesday night this is
[1:05:56] daniel is the book of revelations to the
[1:05:58] jews so this is the basically the same
[1:06:01] scene that's in revelations 10
[1:06:02] 7. it's just that remember when he
[1:06:04] raises his hand in revelation 10
[1:06:06] 7 time shall be no longer that's me and
[1:06:09] you
[1:06:10] but now remember israel has a certain
[1:06:13] length of time
[1:06:15] 1260 days that's all they got so it'll
[1:06:18] be that it shall be for a time
[1:06:21] times and a dividing of time three and a
[1:06:23] half years
[1:06:24] 260 days and when he shall accomp
[1:06:28] have accomplished to scatter the power
[1:06:29] of the holy people all these things
[1:06:31] shall be finished and i heard but i
[1:06:33] understood not
[1:06:34] i said ah oh my lord what shall be the
[1:06:37] end of these things daniel's lord
[1:06:39] that's what 4 000 years ago almost and
[1:06:41] he said go thy way daniel for the words
[1:06:43] are closed up
[1:06:46] and sealed in a book now what happened
[1:06:49] when we come to the end time what
[1:06:50] happened to that book
[1:06:52] it got open so we can see what that
[1:06:55] prophecy is all about
[1:06:57] many shall be purified and made white
[1:06:59] and tried but the wicked shall do
[1:07:01] wickedly
[1:07:02] and none of the wicked shall understand
[1:07:04] but the wise what a promise
[1:07:06] but the wise shall understand
[1:07:09] amen the wise
[1:07:13] will understand go to 9 24
[1:07:16] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[1:07:18] and upon the holy city
[1:07:21] now remember in 70 weeks of daniel
[1:07:24] there's 70 weeks which is 490 years
[1:07:27] everybody
[1:07:29] i know some maybe not but that's okay
[1:07:31] we'll get to it maybe later again loot
[1:07:33] back over it again
[1:07:34] 70 weeks because a week
[1:07:37] a week equals seven years if you look in
[1:07:39] your bible in genesis
[1:07:41] jacob worked seven years for rachel and
[1:07:44] leah and he
[1:07:45] and it was it said fulfill her week
[1:07:48] so one week equals seven years so 70
[1:07:50] weeks which is 490 years
[1:07:53] god is going to give them 490 years to
[1:07:56] repent
[1:07:57] and turn back to god everybody got that
[1:07:59] saying ma'am
[1:08:01] all right so now 483 years is already
[1:08:03] over with
[1:08:06] back then we'll get to that later so
[1:08:09] there's
[1:08:11] seven years left after the rapture
[1:08:13] because listen this can only happen
[1:08:15] after the rapture takes place because
[1:08:16] remember god don't deal with us and the
[1:08:18] jews at the same time
[1:08:20] that's right we're gone we're out of
[1:08:22] here and then god goes to them
[1:08:24] to to give them their redemption
[1:08:27] preaches three and a half years
[1:08:29] to do six things but look at the first
[1:08:31] three finish the transgression what do
[1:08:33] you do with you
[1:08:37] make an end of sin what'd he do to you
[1:08:40] make reconciliation for iniquity what
[1:08:42] did he do to you
[1:08:43] he justified you he sanctified you
[1:08:47] and he filled you with the holy ghost
[1:08:49] amen
[1:08:51] that's what they're going to get
[1:08:52] preached to in that three and a half
[1:08:54] years
[1:08:55] and then what's going to happen in the
[1:08:57] second part of the week is this right
[1:08:58] here
[1:08:59] brings in everlasting righteousness
[1:09:00] we'll get to that later self-division
[1:09:02] and prophecy
[1:09:03] and anoint the most holy because this is
[1:09:05] right at the millennium is going to
[1:09:07] start right here
[1:09:08] because it's going to take 74 weeks
[1:09:12] to bring israel back to their condition
[1:09:15] of redemption okay 70 weeks 490 years
[1:09:20] everybody got there all right so let's
[1:09:22] go to
[1:09:23] number three
[1:09:26] brother brown takes this in order
[1:09:29] then when the church is taken up moses
[1:09:31] and elijah appears in revelation 11
[1:09:34] all right when the church now that's
[1:09:36] bride
[1:09:38] the bride you have to see what he's
[1:09:40] talking about remember that's 1953.
[1:09:43] it was 1963 when i said i now call you
[1:09:46] bride he knew the difference in the
[1:09:47] bride and the church
[1:09:48] because there's a difference in the
[1:09:49] bride in the church but you can use them
[1:09:52] listen a church can be a church
[1:09:55] a bride can be a church but the church
[1:09:57] can't be the bride
[1:09:59] yeah don't need to add that up again i
[1:10:02] don't know if i can say that again
[1:10:03] but do you understand what i mean church
[1:10:05] is the church
[1:10:07] the bride can be the church but the
[1:10:09] church can't be the bride
[1:10:11] all right which is just regular church
[1:10:12] which was the foolish virgins the ones
[1:10:14] that don't have the baptism of the holy
[1:10:15] ghost
[1:10:17] all right look moses elijah appears in
[1:10:18] revelation 11. and what
[1:10:20] preaches jesus christ to them and the
[1:10:23] holy spirit
[1:10:24] took from the gentiles now look it's not
[1:10:26] took away from us
[1:10:27] we're going out of here there's no more
[1:10:30] holy ghost for listen
[1:10:31] the prophet even tells it even the
[1:10:33] people are still going to go to church
[1:10:35] they're going to think they're getting
[1:10:37] the holy ghost why because the
[1:10:39] sanctification they think that's the
[1:10:40] holy ghost
[1:10:43] i'm sorry holy ghost took from the
[1:10:46] gentiles
[1:10:47] the rapture comes for the church or
[1:10:49] bride to be taken away
[1:10:51] and the jews that's left here will be
[1:10:53] preached for three and a half years
[1:10:54] because he said there'd be seventy weeks
[1:10:55] still determined
[1:10:57] on thy people messiah be cut off in
[1:10:59] between he's talking about the one week
[1:11:00] of messiah ministry three and a half
[1:11:02] years before
[1:11:03] that jesus preached and then three and a
[1:11:05] half he's going to preach to the two
[1:11:06] witnesses when he's taken away the
[1:11:08] gentiles will be given a place then they
[1:11:12] get three
[1:11:14] i need i need to read a little more
[1:11:18] they'll get three more years and a half
[1:11:20] to be preached to of jesus christ
[1:11:23] let's go to zechariah 12 verse 10. and i
[1:11:25] will pour it out upon the house of david
[1:11:27] with this that's jews
[1:11:29] and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem
[1:11:31] did in 70 weeks are determined to do
[1:11:32] what
[1:11:34] bring jews back and the city you got to
[1:11:36] have the jews and the city
[1:11:38] all right so in the inhabitants of
[1:11:40] jerusalem the spirit of grace and
[1:11:42] supplication
[1:11:43] and they shall look upon me whom they
[1:11:45] have pierced who was that jesus christ
[1:11:48] and they shall mourn for him as one
[1:11:49] mourneth for his only son and shall be
[1:11:51] in bitterness for him
[1:11:52] as one in his bitterness for his
[1:11:54] firstborn
[1:11:55] and that day shall should be a great
[1:11:57] morning in jerusalem as the morning of
[1:11:58] hadramanon
[1:12:00] in the valley of megiddon which is
[1:12:03] armageddon zechariah 13 verse 6 and one
[1:12:07] shall say unto him
[1:12:08] what are these wounds in thine hands
[1:12:09] then he shall say those which i was
[1:12:11] wounded
[1:12:12] in the house of my prince their friends
[1:12:15] they're going to preach jesus christ so
[1:12:16] much three and a half years
[1:12:19] so they're going to realize they killed
[1:12:21] the messiah 2000 years ago
[1:12:23] and they're going to be in trouble but
[1:12:25] what did
[1:12:26] joseph say don't worry
[1:12:30] this was done to preserve you
[1:12:33] this was done to preserve life this was
[1:12:37] done in other words look
[1:12:38] this is what god's telling them this is
[1:12:40] done because i promised you i'd come
[1:12:42] back and get you
[1:12:44] i've already took the bride you missed
[1:12:46] that part
[1:12:48] but i've come back to get you because i
[1:12:49] promise i'll never forget you
[1:12:52] what a mighty god we serve
[1:12:55] all right revelations 6 verse 12
[1:12:58] and now beheld when he had opened the
[1:13:00] sixth seal lo there was a great
[1:13:02] earthquake
[1:13:03] now remember we are not here when this
[1:13:06] happens
[1:13:08] because this is the great tribulation
[1:13:10] everybody got that
[1:13:11] we are not here but we got to show this
[1:13:14] the place where this is where the church
[1:13:16] has got to go through
[1:13:18] not the bride there was a great
[1:13:20] earthquake and the sun became black as
[1:13:22] sackcloth of hair and the moon became
[1:13:23] his blood
[1:13:24] and the stars of heaven fell into the
[1:13:26] earth sounds like kind of a nuclear
[1:13:28] thing doesn't it
[1:13:31] even as the fig trees catholics are
[1:13:32] untimely figs when she is shaken of a
[1:13:34] mighty wind
[1:13:35] and the heaven departed as a scroll when
[1:13:37] it was rolled together
[1:13:41] y'all ever noticed when they set off a
[1:13:43] atomic bomb what happens
[1:13:46] look at the mushroom it rolls open
[1:13:53] right folks this
[1:13:57] we know one thing's for sure like i said
[1:14:00] again thank god for a prophet
[1:14:02] he said there would be no atomic bomb
[1:14:04] hit the earth until the bride's gone
[1:14:08] so you can whatever you want to say if
[1:14:10] you see an atomic bomb go off
[1:14:13] call brother dale he won't be there
[1:14:18] because we'll be gone but the heavens
[1:14:20] departed as a scroll
[1:14:22] and every mountain and island were moved
[1:14:24] out of their place
[1:14:25] wow every island every mountain
[1:14:29] and the kings of the earth and the great
[1:14:31] men and the rich men the chief captains
[1:14:32] and the mighty men and every bondman and
[1:14:34] every freeman hid themselves in the dens
[1:14:36] and in the rocks of the mountains
[1:14:38] and said to the mountains and rocks fall
[1:14:39] on us and hide us from the face of him
[1:14:41] that sitteth on the throne
[1:14:43] and from the wrath of the lamb for the
[1:14:44] great day of his wrath
[1:14:46] has come and who shall be able
[1:14:49] who shall be able to stand
[1:14:54] wow that's pretty tough
[1:14:57] so now let's go to the first chart not
[1:14:59] the day i'm saving the week sorry let's
[1:15:00] go to the first chart
[1:15:02] and we'll stop here in just a minute and
[1:15:04] take a communion
[1:15:09] okay so now where are we slide can you
[1:15:11] slide there you go
[1:15:13] we're almost getting to the future home
[1:15:17] all right the rapture all born again
[1:15:19] believers everybody see that all
[1:15:21] born-again believers
[1:15:23] going to rapture right here all right
[1:15:26] then there's three and a half there's
[1:15:27] 1260 days two prophets according to
[1:15:29] revelation 11 3 4
[1:15:31] 2 13. they're going to preach 1260 days
[1:15:34] and then what's going to happen now
[1:15:36] remember
[1:15:38] during this time right here is the
[1:15:41] tribulation period to the gentile world
[1:15:44] because those two prophets the bible
[1:15:47] says they can
[1:15:49] bend nature they can make this do this
[1:15:51] way well they're the cause of when the
[1:15:52] sixth seal opens brother brown said who
[1:15:54] opens the sixth seal
[1:15:56] the two prophets they'll open that seal
[1:16:00] by being able to call fire and all these
[1:16:02] different things
[1:16:04] because i want you to to think about
[1:16:06] something really quick
[1:16:09] and then we'll read a couple more quotes
[1:16:11] and stop because we stop right here
[1:16:13] we should be okay and we'll continue
[1:16:16] again
[1:16:17] because right here look when the rapture
[1:16:20] happens to us there's three and a half
[1:16:22] years
[1:16:24] tribulation is going to set in on the
[1:16:26] gentiles
[1:16:28] and the two prophets are going to preach
[1:16:29] to the jews and then what's going to
[1:16:30] happen when they get finished preaching
[1:16:33] they're going to die in other words 144
[1:16:37] 000

[1:16:40] witnesses are going to be killed
[1:16:41] and the bible says the whole world sees
[1:16:43] them so cnn's there

[1:16:49] cbs because them three them two guys
[1:16:53] tormented the world for 1260 days
[1:16:56] every time they try to kill what if you
[1:16:58] try to kill the bible says in the way
[1:17:00] that they try to kill them is the way

[1:17:24] what if you tried for three and a half
[1:17:25] years to kill two people
[1:17:28] i'm talking about the whole world
[1:17:30] they're going to send everybody even
[1:17:32] israel is going to send them assad kgb
[1:17:37] and they can't kill them for three and a
[1:17:39] half years
[1:17:40] but when they do kill them though what's
[1:17:43] going to happen
[1:17:44] they're going to lay in the streets and
[1:17:46] what's going to happen
[1:17:49] they're going to resurrect right in
[1:17:50] front of everybody's eyes
[1:17:53] in front of the world they're going to
[1:17:55] have the cameras on them the whole time
[1:17:58] they'll cut away and say well we've
[1:18:00] finally we've got rid of these guys and
[1:18:02] they're going to do this
[1:18:03] we're going to leave them laying there
[1:18:04] look at them they're they're just
[1:18:05] they're bloating they're they're turning
[1:18:07] green they're you know
[1:18:09] you're not commentating and all of a
[1:18:10] sudden they're going to go back and go
[1:18:14] oh they've resurrected
[1:18:18] and then they're going to take a rapture
[1:18:20] but let me tell you something the
[1:18:21] difference between
[1:18:23] remember we'll cover in a minute but
[1:18:25] we're covering it later
[1:18:26] there's two battles and then we'll then
[1:18:30] we'll stop right here
[1:18:31] i'll read a few more but remember
[1:18:32] there's two battles everybody wake up
[1:18:34] just for a minute please
[1:18:35] two battles the battle of armageddon
[1:18:39] and the battle of gog and magog
[1:18:43] according to revelations 20 verse 9. now
[1:18:45] there is differences in these two
[1:18:47] battles
[1:18:49] and you need to understand both of them
[1:18:52] to when i keep going through here you'll
[1:18:53] understand what i'm talking about
[1:18:56] the bible of armageddon at armageddon
[1:18:59] is going to be a natural battle
[1:19:04] it's going to be nations against nation
[1:19:06] it's going to be this one against that
[1:19:08] one
[1:19:08] they're going to all confer converge on
[1:19:10] jerusalem and they're going to start
[1:19:12] punching buttons
[1:19:16] the battle of armageddon will be an
[1:19:18] atomic war
[1:19:23] now the battle of gog and magog is a
[1:19:26] spiritual war
[1:19:29] it's not a it's not an earthly battle
[1:19:32] and it's not a battle that's going to do
[1:19:34] this and that it's not going to rain
[1:19:36] fire down we read we read in the bible
[1:19:40] and many generations never saw nuclear
[1:19:42] war or what happened to it but
[1:19:44] remember in the battle of armageddon it
[1:19:46] says that man's flesh
[1:19:50] will come off of their body while
[1:19:52] they're still alive
[1:19:54] that's nuclear that's nuclear war that's
[1:19:57] that's the
[1:19:58] fallout and all the different things but
[1:20:01] now not with this battle
[1:20:02] this is going to be god and the devil
[1:20:05] and his spirits and god's going to have
[1:20:08] to get rid of them because remember
[1:20:10] the battle of armageddon doesn't kill
[1:20:11] satan the bell of armageddon doesn't
[1:20:14] kill his imps
[1:20:15] remember they're what bound for a
[1:20:17] thousand years they're right down
[1:20:19] underneath here and they can't do
[1:20:20] anything
[1:20:20] but they're gonna raise up just one more
[1:20:22] time but remember this battle that's
[1:20:24] coming up will be a nuclear battle
[1:20:28] a nuclear war between men because the
[1:20:30] prophet tells us
[1:20:32] man always destroys himself
[1:20:36] okay so let's read this right here just
[1:20:38] for a second revelation 7 verse 1
[1:20:41] after these things i saw four angels
[1:20:44] standing on the four corners of the
[1:20:45] earth holding the four winds now where
[1:20:47] the four winds
[1:20:48] wars all right holding the four winds of
[1:20:51] the earth that the wind should not blow
[1:20:53] on the earth nor on the sea nor on any
[1:20:54] tree
[1:20:55] and i saw another angel ascending from
[1:20:57] the east having the seal of the living
[1:20:59] god
[1:21:00] and he cried with a loud voice to the
[1:21:02] four angels
[1:21:03] to whom was given to hurt the earth and
[1:21:05] sea saying hurt not the earth neither
[1:21:07] the sea nor the trees
[1:21:08] till we have sealed the servants
[1:21:11] now hold on you and i are not servants
[1:21:15] thank god for a prophet again we're
[1:21:17] children of god we're sons and daughters
[1:21:19] we're not servants
[1:21:22] so who is that look hurt not the earth
[1:21:24] neither the seed nor the trees now look
[1:21:26] all this is happening to the gentiles
[1:21:31] but over there in israel god's got to
[1:21:33] call out 144 000 in 1260 days
[1:21:37] and there's not all that chaos going on
[1:21:39] over there because he said hurt not the
[1:21:41] earth neither the sea nor the trees till
[1:21:43] we have sealed
[1:21:44] the servants of our god in their
[1:21:46] foreheads
[1:21:48] because this is you say well who i don't
[1:21:50] know who that is well you will right
[1:21:51] here
[1:21:52] and i heard the number now you're going
[1:21:55] to see numbers
[1:21:56] in the bible talks about multitudes
[1:21:59] nations
[1:22:00] ones that you can't number that's
[1:22:02] gentiles
[1:22:04] people nations people you can't you
[1:22:07] can't so
[1:22:07] so much of a number you can't number
[1:22:09] them but remember
[1:22:10] here israel has numbers
[1:22:14] and i heard the number of them which
[1:22:15] were sealed and there were sealed and
[1:22:17] hundred
[1:22:18] and forty and four thousand of all the
[1:22:20] tribes of the children of israel
[1:22:22] so who are they talking about that's
[1:22:24] talking about the two witnesses going
[1:22:25] over preaching
[1:22:27] uh redemption to the 144 000 and they
[1:22:30] are saved of the tribe of judah
[1:22:33] 12 000. reuben 12 000 gad 12 000
[1:22:36] asher 12 000 neptulum 12 000
[1:22:40] manasseh 12 000 simeon 12 000
[1:22:43] levi 12 000 iscar 12 000 zebulun 12 000
[1:22:48] joseph 12 000 of the tribal benjamin 12
[1:22:52] 000. if you add all them up you're going
[1:22:54] to get 144 000
[1:22:56] every time amen so that's who they're
[1:22:59] talking about that's to the jews then
[1:23:01] hurt not to
[1:23:01] hurt not wherever they're at they're
[1:23:04] over there in israel now that's what
[1:23:06] gets me
[1:23:07] the biggest turmoil in the world is in
[1:23:09] israel and
[1:23:10] palestine and hamas and all that right
[1:23:12] they're just blowing each other up
[1:23:14] almost
[1:23:14] but during those three and a half years
[1:23:16] god's going to shift that thing out
[1:23:18] and the world is going to start
[1:23:19] destroying each other and it's going to
[1:23:21] then wind up in israel because israel's
[1:23:23] going to have to have three and a half
[1:23:24] years to preach to
[1:23:26] in not so much chaos because they got to
[1:23:30] hear they got to get together they got
[1:23:31] to hear the message
[1:23:34] all right now let's get this right here
[1:23:35] real quick and then we'll finish
[1:23:38] then we'll take communion communion and
[1:23:40] foot washing
[1:23:42] daniel 9 27 and he shall confirm now
[1:23:46] look
[1:23:49] bring up the daniel 70 weeks chart one
[1:23:51] more time before we everybody okay i
[1:23:52] know it's hot i know you're trying to go
[1:23:54] to sleep and you
[1:23:55] want to get out of here but
[1:23:58] this is important if it's not important
[1:24:02] you shouldn't come
[1:24:04] so the 70 weeks of daniel push it back
[1:24:07] over that way a little bit
[1:24:09] and i don't want it to be confusing so
[1:24:11] watch
[1:24:12] 70 weeks are determined
[1:24:16] all right everybody got that so there's
[1:24:18] a time it started
[1:24:19] and they got 490 years to save israel
[1:24:23] just to make it simple everybody got
[1:24:24] that all right so now bring it back this
[1:24:27] way a little bit
[1:24:28] so now jesus is right here he died right
[1:24:31] here on the cross
[1:24:38] i'm old i'm looking for these things
[1:24:40] fine so right here's calvary
[1:24:43] and thank you for making it bigger i'm
[1:24:44] just kidding but 62 and 7 is 69 so 69
[1:24:49] weeks has already happened
[1:24:51] god look this is grace right here folks
[1:24:55] because listen without us this right
[1:24:58] here
[1:24:59] should be jammed in right here everybody
[1:25:02] got that
[1:25:03] that over there should be right here and
[1:25:06] when christ
[1:25:07] died if they would accepted him in the
[1:25:10] jewish realm
[1:25:11] there would have been no gentiles right
[1:25:15] but we've got grace now knowing that he
[1:25:17] had to put them away because they put
[1:25:19] him on the cross
[1:25:20] but we did we know that but they
[1:25:22] literally put him on the cross
[1:25:24] because they said let his blood be on us
[1:25:25] and our children and that's why god had
[1:25:27] to then chop it off right here
[1:25:30] give the gentile bride time to come in
[1:25:32] thank god
[1:25:35] that's me and you folks if not that
[1:25:36] would have been right here they would
[1:25:38] have took a rapture and it would have
[1:25:39] been millennium and been done with
[1:25:41] right but god give he separated
[1:25:45] because of grace and because of to get
[1:25:47] this bride out
[1:25:49] he had to cut them off
[1:25:52] right at calvary he started
[1:25:55] a gentile dispensation now remember that
[1:25:57] gentile dispensation is going to end
[1:26:00] so there's one more week left after the
[1:26:02] rapture
[1:26:03] to finish the 70 weeks of daniel from
[1:26:06] here
[1:26:07] to over here where it's not on the chart
[1:26:09] to bring it together to finish it
[1:26:12] everybody got that we were we
[1:26:15] we're the ones that put that gap in
[1:26:16] there god did for
[1:26:18] us then he's going to pick right back up
[1:26:22] and what do you do if they rejected his
[1:26:24] three and a half year message over here
[1:26:26] everybody with me they rejected this
[1:26:28] three and a half year message the jews
[1:26:30] did
[1:26:31] and he's not going to let him perish
[1:26:33] he's going to he's going to save him
[1:26:34] because he said he was
[1:26:36] he's going to have to preach that same
[1:26:37] message right here
[1:26:39] right anybody got that and then what
[1:26:42] really happens is this three and a half
[1:26:44] year message
[1:26:45] we accepted and that's what we've been
[1:26:47] living on for 2 000 years
[1:26:49] is a three and a half year message of
[1:26:51] jesus christ
[1:26:52] amen but they're only going to have 1260
[1:26:55] days so
[1:26:56] he's going to have to send two prophets
[1:26:57] what does the book of amos say he does
[1:26:59] nothing until what
[1:27:01] he reveals it to the prophets okay so we
[1:27:04] come over here
[1:27:05] and we see that that message of jesus
[1:27:07] christ comes and lands in two prophets
[1:27:09] they preach
[1:27:09] three and a half years they preach it so
[1:27:12] much to where they see the cross
[1:27:14] and they see that lord of mercy we've
[1:27:16] done we've done something
[1:27:19] really awful and god's going to destroy
[1:27:21] us
[1:27:22] he said no he said i know you i know you
[1:27:25] you didn't see the nails in my hand here
[1:27:28] but through those two messengers
[1:27:30] like i read it before where did you get
[1:27:32] those scars
[1:27:34] he said in the house of my friends he
[1:27:37] said don't worry
[1:27:39] he said i'm going to take you up in the
[1:27:40] rapture then
[1:27:42] because the bible says right here
[1:27:49] and he shall confirm the covenant this
[1:27:52] is daniel 9 27. don't go back to it
[1:27:55] we've read this enough and he's he who's
[1:27:57] to he
[1:27:59] now listen god doesn't make a covenant
[1:28:02] and break it ever when god makes a
[1:28:06] covenant it's an everlasting eternal
[1:28:08] covenant
[1:28:09] everybody got that so this he is fixing
[1:28:12] to break the covenant so who is this he
[1:28:14] this he is the antichrist the beast
[1:28:17] that's right the pope
[1:28:22] because let me ask you a question i've
[1:28:23] got to cover this
[1:28:25] we'll stand outside and talk for two
[1:28:27] hours so we can talk in here if it's all
[1:28:30] right with y'all
[1:28:32] all right so the gentile bride does what
[1:28:36] she goes home
[1:28:39] and then the pope comes on the scene
[1:28:43] but what has israel been looking for for
[1:28:45] this whole two thousand years
[1:28:47] in ad70 titus
[1:28:51] a roman general destroyed
[1:28:55] jerusalem to the ground remember in
[1:28:57] matthew 24 they asked him three things
[1:29:00] he said they won't be a stone left on
[1:29:02] another
[1:29:04] well that was when titus a roman general
[1:29:06] get that roman general
[1:29:08] comes into jerusalem they shut the door
[1:29:10] and run into the temple course god's not
[1:29:12] there anymore
[1:29:14] and they literally eat their own kids
[1:29:15] and to bark off the trees
[1:29:18] titus finally goes in and destroys and
[1:29:20] kills everybody that's in there and the
[1:29:21] blood ran out the
[1:29:23] gate right
[1:29:27] but what did he take with him
[1:29:31] he took something very important that's
[1:29:34] going to be connected to the end time
[1:29:37] in 1870 titus destroyed the temple
[1:29:40] took it apart
[1:29:44] and took the menorah took the ark of the
[1:29:47] covenant
[1:29:49] took the laver took all the purple
[1:29:52] curtains took everything and where'd he
[1:29:54] take them to he's a roman general he
[1:29:56] didn't take him to italy
[1:29:58] common he took it to rome
[1:30:02] so who has a you know the temple mount
[1:30:04] people are trying their best and
[1:30:06] remember richard we're talking they've
[1:30:07] already got the according to
[1:30:09] the uh i can't remember the name of the
[1:30:12] of the article
[1:30:13] they've already got the red heifer the
[1:30:15] red heifer has been genetically modified
[1:30:17] in the united states
[1:30:19] because the red heifer could only have
[1:30:20] like three colors away from the red
[1:30:22] heifer
[1:30:23] they've got the red heifer ready but
[1:30:25] what do they need
[1:30:27] they need the menorah they need the
[1:30:29] laver
[1:30:30] and they need the ark
[1:30:34] right because see that's what they're
[1:30:35] trying to do they're trying to get all
[1:30:37] that back together because god told them
[1:30:39] in the old testament
[1:30:41] if you'll get all that together i'll
[1:30:42] meet you in that holy of holies
[1:30:45] so the temple mount people are trying
[1:30:47] their best for 2000 years they've been
[1:30:49] trying to put the piece of the puzzle
[1:30:50] together
[1:30:51] they don't have all the pieces but they
[1:30:54] know who's got them
[1:30:56] so when this pope comes up and we leave
[1:30:58] this place this pope comes up you know
[1:30:59] what the pope
[1:31:00] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[1:31:02] many for one week
[1:31:05] what can what covenant is he going to
[1:31:07] give them
[1:31:09] i'm going to give you your things back
[1:31:12] but you got to do this for me
[1:31:16] you got to release all your gold you got
[1:31:19] to release all everything in the
[1:31:21] in the land of of israel to me
[1:31:24] i'm going to give you your things
[1:31:27] because remember
[1:31:29] and in the midst of the week
[1:31:33] he shall cause the sacrifice and
[1:31:35] oblation
[1:31:36] to cease now what's the sacrifice and
[1:31:37] oblation he's they've given him they've
[1:31:40] given his ark back
[1:31:41] they've given israel their art back
[1:31:43] they're already making sacrifices
[1:31:44] they're trying to get the messiah here
[1:31:48] but what's going to happen during that
[1:31:49] three and a half years there stands two
[1:31:52] prophets
[1:31:52] outside of this new temple they've built
[1:31:58] going to make the people so mad that
[1:31:59] they kill 144 000 of their own people
[1:32:03] and two prophets that's right because
[1:32:05] for three and a half years
[1:32:07] they're going to be putting this temple
[1:32:08] back together and they're going to be
[1:32:09] doing their cutting and they're going to
[1:32:11] be doing their sacrifices
[1:32:12] and these two witnesses going to be
[1:32:13] standing outside the temple just like
[1:32:15] jesus did
[1:32:16] and said god's not in there
[1:32:19] you've already killed the lamb of god
[1:32:21] you can sacrifice all you want to
[1:32:24] and then 144 000 of their brethren are
[1:32:26] going to come out
[1:32:27] and they're going to say it's useless
[1:32:30] for you to put this temple together
[1:32:32] because i am the temple of god now
[1:32:38] but now who's also on the scene the
[1:32:41] pope's there
[1:32:43] and he says now wait a minute
[1:32:46] i'm the temple of god remember the bible
[1:32:49] says he wanted to be the temple of god
[1:32:51] sitting
[1:32:52] sitting in the temple of god showing
[1:32:53] himself to be what as god
[1:32:55] that's what's going to make everybody so
[1:32:57] mad right here
[1:33:00] and when it does the 144 000 and the two
[1:33:03] witnesses are going to be caught up
[1:33:05] and then you're going to see tribulation
[1:33:08] like you've never seen before
[1:33:10] that battle of armageddon is going to be
[1:33:11] so bad
[1:33:13] until it's going to be no holes
[1:33:20] barred
[1:33:23] so what's going to happen in the midst
[1:33:24] of the week cause of sacrifice and
[1:33:25] oblation to cease and for the over
[1:33:26] spreading of abomination
[1:33:28] he shall make it desolate you know
[1:33:29] what's going to happen the pope's going
[1:33:31] to walk into their temple
[1:33:34] and he's going to say i'm god and they
[1:33:37] ain't gonna like that
[1:33:39] because he desecrates the temple that's
[1:33:40] what he says he says the over spreading
[1:33:42] he shall cause the sacrifice and
[1:33:43] oblation to cease in other words he's
[1:33:45] telling them to quit
[1:33:46] i'm him now and them jews ain't gonna
[1:33:49] like that
[1:33:50] even the ones that turn 144 thousand
[1:33:52] down are not going to like that
[1:33:54] and he shall make it desolate even until
[1:33:55] the consummation of that determined
[1:33:56] shall be poured out
[1:33:58] upon the desolate
[1:34:03] what's going to happen in the midst of
[1:34:05] that 70th week
[1:34:08] you say brother wait what happens over
[1:34:10] here well you got to remember
[1:34:15] a battle of armageddon a worldwide
[1:34:18] atomic battle
[1:34:20] doesn't last just one day
[1:34:24] it will be over a period of weeks or
[1:34:26] months before everybody's killed
[1:34:28] and then there's no telling how many
[1:34:29] people is going to be killed because of
[1:34:30] radiation
[1:34:32] and all the different things so you can
[1:34:33] carry that on but there's something got
[1:34:35] to happen
[1:34:36] from here to here there's going to be a
[1:34:38] millennial temple and we'll cover it
[1:34:39] later on
[1:34:40] there's going to be a temple built
[1:34:41] somewhere in here because that thing's
[1:34:43] got to be done
[1:34:44] at the end of that 70th week because the
[1:34:46] prophet of god tells us
[1:34:48] we're the anointing to the temple
[1:34:51] we're the anointing to the temple so
[1:34:52] they're going to build the temple
[1:34:53] because we don't know anything about
[1:34:54] temples because we're gentiles
[1:34:56] but they're going to build it and we're
[1:34:57] going to enter into that to anoint
[1:34:59] that temple for the thousand years
[1:35:04] of millennial reign and i'll read you
[1:35:06] some more quotes later on but the
[1:35:07] prophet of god tells us many many times
[1:35:10] he said they're going to absolutely hate
[1:35:13] these jews the 144 000
[1:35:17] and then when they're caught up listen
[1:35:19] when they're caught up there is zero
[1:35:21] holy ghost on the earth
[1:35:23] zero i'm talking about all over the
[1:35:26] world listen the bride's gone
[1:35:29] 144 000 and the two witnesses they get
[1:35:31] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:35:33] they're caught up in a rapture they're
[1:35:35] gone who's left
[1:35:38] satan the pope false prophet
[1:35:42] beast whatever you want to call them
[1:35:43] they're just going to start destroying
[1:35:45] each other
[1:35:48] and man has always destroyed their self
[1:35:52] and they're going to keep pushing
[1:35:53] buttons and pushing buttons and pushing
[1:35:54] buttons
[1:35:55] until this world's gonna be annihilated
[1:35:58] when we come back into the millennium
[1:36:01] i don't i don't i don't see why there's
[1:36:02] not they won't be structured still here
[1:36:04] because it's not gonna be completely
[1:36:05] wiped off like it is
[1:36:06] the battle of gog and magog they may be
[1:36:08] this you know the shell of this church
[1:36:10] may still be here but it's not going to
[1:36:12] bother us
[1:36:15] we got the biggest bomb there ever was
[1:36:18] called the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:36:20] and it's not going to harm us nuclear
[1:36:23] battle
[1:36:24] is not going to harm us if we come right
[1:36:26] back into the thing it's while it's
[1:36:28] going
[1:36:28] right but you know what we're going to
[1:36:30] be carried away we're going to be off in
[1:36:31] a safe place
[1:36:34] not going to have to worry about that
[1:36:36] what about folks you're standing
[1:36:39] and your flesh
[1:36:43] melts off your body before you die
[1:36:46] the birds will eat you before you die
[1:36:49] that's worldwide but not for the bride
[1:36:52] why would god send
[1:36:54] why would god send you through that
[1:36:57] but he is going to send the church to it
[1:36:59] because the church turned him down
[1:37:02] amen the church didn't get the holy
[1:37:04] ghost the ten virgins five of them were
[1:37:07] wives they went in the rapture
[1:37:08] the five foolish ones they did not
[1:37:11] because they were foolish let's not be
[1:37:13] foolish
[1:37:14] let's know that we know that we know
[1:37:16] that the new birth is in our soul
[1:37:18] not just something we think about
[1:37:20] something we talk about something we
[1:37:21] wonder about
[1:37:22] and something we hope for
[1:37:25] see i'm not going to hope that i go to
[1:37:27] all that i've got to go to the white
[1:37:28] throne judgment and hope
[1:37:31] that i'm going to get saved no no i
[1:37:34] don't think so folks
[1:37:35] you got to know that you know and you
[1:37:37] got to know now you will not get the
[1:37:38] holy ghost
[1:37:40] after the rapture takes place if you're
[1:37:42] a gentile
[1:37:45] gentile church door is closed listen
[1:37:47] when god closed the door
[1:37:49] and noah's age remember noah didn't
[1:37:51] close it
[1:37:52] god closed the door and he decided when
[1:37:54] to close it
[1:37:56] when he closed it there was not one
[1:37:58] person ever got on that ark again
[1:38:00] not one i'm sure i've told you many
[1:38:03] times before i'll bet you there were
[1:38:04] claw marks on the outside of that door
[1:38:06] people tried to get in
[1:38:08] i bet you there was claw marks on that
[1:38:10] outside of that
[1:38:12] ark with people trying to get up into
[1:38:14] that ark
[1:38:16] and the door was shut not another
[1:38:19] gentile was saved
[1:38:21] i'm talking about us now so let's stand
[1:38:24] to our feet
[1:38:30] we'll just go ahead and go right on in
[1:38:31] the communion if that's all right listen
[1:38:33] if you have a need today if you have a
[1:38:36] need today
[1:38:39] it's already been met and we have
[1:38:42] absolutely
[1:38:46] we have absolutely come to a place
[1:38:50] to where you can be healed standing in
[1:38:52] your seat
[1:38:54] and you can be healed we've seen people
[1:38:55] heal by taking communion
[1:38:57] because it's what it's an ordinance of
[1:38:59] god ordained of god an ordinance of god
[1:39:02] and and really it's a requirement of of
[1:39:04] all
[1:39:05] born-again believers because if you
[1:39:08] don't want to take communion then
[1:39:13] why wouldn't you want to because you're
[1:39:15] partaking of participating in something
[1:39:17] god told you to participate in
[1:39:19] same way with foot washing so let's go
[1:39:21] into the communion so if you have a need
[1:39:23] today
[1:39:24] let it be met while the communion is
[1:39:26] going on let it be met while the foot
[1:39:28] washing is going on
[1:39:29] okay so let's read in first corinthians
[1:39:32] 11 verse 23
[1:39:35] for i have received of the lord that
[1:39:36] which also i delivered unto you that the
[1:39:38] lord jesus the same night in which he
[1:39:39] was betrayed took bread
[1:39:41] when he had given thanks he'd break it
[1:39:42] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:39:44] is broken for you
[1:39:45] this due in remembrance of me after the
[1:39:48] same manner also he took the cup and
[1:39:50] when he had stopped saying this cup is
[1:39:52] the new testament in my blood
[1:39:54] this do you as often as you drink it in
[1:39:56] remembrance of me
[1:39:57] for as often as you drink this bread eat
[1:39:59] this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:40:01] show the lord's death
[1:40:02] till he comes wherefore whosoever shall
[1:40:05] eat this bread
[1:40:06] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:40:08] unworthily
[1:40:10] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:40:12] the lord but let a man examine himself
[1:40:14] in other words we're going to give a
[1:40:15] minute a moment of silence
[1:40:17] for you to clear the slate get
[1:40:19] everything out of the way
[1:40:22] and then you can take communion because
[1:40:24] it says for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:40:26] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:40:28] to himself not discerning
[1:40:30] the lord's body who's the lord's body me
[1:40:32] and you
[1:40:33] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:40:35] among you in many sleep that's pretty
[1:40:36] serious
[1:40:38] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:40:39] should not be judged but when we are
[1:40:41] judged we are chastened to the lord
[1:40:43] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:40:44] world now see that sets us apart right
[1:40:46] there
[1:40:47] that sets the bride apart we're not
[1:40:49] condemned with the world
[1:40:51] if we come under the conditions of the
[1:40:52] new birth we cannot be condemned with
[1:40:54] the world
[1:40:56] that's what it says right here wherefore
[1:40:58] my brethren when you come together to
[1:40:59] eat tarry
[1:41:01] one for another and if any man hunger
[1:41:03] they meet at home that you come not
[1:41:04] together into condemnation
[1:41:06] the rest will not set an order when i
[1:41:08] come i've been reading the
[1:41:10] history of paul and when paul came up to
[1:41:12] the corinthians what happened was
[1:41:14] is the only rooms that the christians
[1:41:16] could use were usually
[1:41:18] people that were of wealth that had that
[1:41:20] were wealthy and had these big homes and
[1:41:22] big houses
[1:41:23] and they were just having parties they'd
[1:41:25] bring a big feast and they'd bring all
[1:41:27] the wine and they'd just eat and they
[1:41:28] would carry on and
[1:41:30] paul had to rebuke him and say no you
[1:41:32] you need to eat at home
[1:41:34] this is a lord's supper this is a solemn
[1:41:37] time this is the time when we pray
[1:41:39] and we don't go to all that carrying on
[1:41:40] business because he said if any man
[1:41:42] hunger lady meet at home that you come
[1:41:44] not together under condemnation
[1:41:46] he was watching them do that and he had
[1:41:47] to set him in order to make sure that
[1:41:49] they took communion and it was a solemn
[1:41:51] time and it was a time of
[1:41:52] of of reflection in the time that we
[1:41:55] what
[1:41:56] enter in with the sufferings of christ
[1:42:00] he said then the rest i will set an
[1:42:01] order when i come when you head back to
[1:42:03] the corinthians so let's
[1:42:05] um let's pray real quick and then we'll
[1:42:08] then we'll break the bread the heavenly
[1:42:09] father we pray lord that
[1:42:12] today now we move into another part of
[1:42:13] the service
[1:42:16] or this is a solemn time not to be
[1:42:18] playing
[1:42:19] because you said lord if we discern it
[1:42:21] wrong that
[1:42:23] many are weak and sickly among us and
[1:42:24] many sleep father we don't want that to
[1:42:26] happen
[1:42:28] we want us to be strong christians lord
[1:42:31] so lord i pray anything that we've done
[1:42:33] lord i pray that you bring it to all any
[1:42:34] of our remembrance lord and we promise
[1:42:36] we'll take care of it
[1:42:38] father just give us this daily bread as
[1:42:40] we partake it
[1:42:41] forgive us of our sins and bless the
[1:42:42] ones that are with us lord today in this
[1:42:44] house
[1:42:45] as we think about 2 000 years ago that
[1:42:47] people would have to meet lord in little
[1:42:49] places maybe
[1:42:50] catacombs and all the different places
[1:42:53] for fear of the
[1:42:54] of the persecution lord i pray that lord
[1:42:58] we live in a free country but lord we
[1:42:59] see that the rains are being tightened
[1:43:01] ever so much each day
[1:43:03] and lord until you come we're going to
[1:43:04] take this communion as much as we can as
[1:43:06] possible as we can
[1:43:08] and then lord we'll stay with you in the
[1:43:09] marriage supper and we'll take communion
[1:43:12] and we'll enjoy that time with you lord
[1:43:14] thank you for saving us lord
[1:43:16] thank you for filling us with the holy
[1:43:18] ghost and then thank you for bringing
[1:43:19] this message of the hour to our
[1:43:21] attention
[1:43:22] and where we can receive it lord we
[1:43:24] thank you for that father
[1:43:25] we ask you just bless the people in this
[1:43:27] building in jesus name we pray in the
[1:43:28] furtheman of this service
[1:43:30] amen the bible said he took bread and
[1:43:32] blessed it
