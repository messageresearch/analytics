========================================

campers on I'm I've got it on maybe I'll see you being a little bit it's going to be still going to be a little bit difficult to read but i'll give the course alright Justin listen before we get into this let's go to Lauren frame okay but Jesus we just thank you John for opening a real word for the privilege together in order today Igor great an orgy or should you leave a bit of weight as he smashed and to make them leave all the ones that are sick and afflicted it couldn't be here today on which the services this morning from my heart so I kind of want to take up but this is a scripture that's that's really familiar to all the ones that have been in a message for a long time so you know a lot of times we think that that things have to be a lot of new things have to be brought out but I want to kind of focus on just one of the ones that are maybe the main point of the message really you know when I when I was growing up I when I first really got things throughout the message a lot of us forget on the phone you know if you if you gonna settle up the message look how to do you know and you know it's good to get inspired about the message to see what the essential essential three and of the message really is if you look at what what the answer that Jesus gave to them when they were like where where will the the ones that are ones in the bed he's taken ones in the field he was taking all these are taken away and it seems real mysterious and the answer he gives is is also seems real mysterious but I believe the gospel can be simplified if unica usually when he broke the bread and the fish as he gave it out to his disciples to break out to the people and I believe that it can be simplified in a way that's real easy to understand and see what the answer that Jesus gave wheresoever that you go wheresoever the body is a little where the Eagles be gathered together in Matthew there whatever the carcass is the Eagle will be getting together that that's the thread of the whole message the thread of how you get born again how you grow as a christian how you grow in the statute perfect man and how you'll take a body change so where will the eagle's be gathered together is that you're asking where are these people get going to go they're going to go to the Lord for as a lightning that lightning out of the one part under hitters shina Thunder the other partner in a social also the son of man being his day I asked the scripture right before that the first must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and you know that in a message masterpiece program toddler that that beginning of the first it went in Christ's ministry parallels what's happening down here in the end where Christ is manifest in the flesh again and the bride will be persecuted abroad will be pushed out the denominations the drive will be miss Erskine when when the bride begins to say I my father one of these other things that shoka pull away that visitors through the same way that Jesus was so he's speaking about himself but he's also speaking about what's happening today but first must suffer many things this generation and as it was in the day of Noah so shall i be offered in the nays of the son of man so I want to just kind of slowly and methodically take a little tour of some of these scriptures and remind us of what we're doing because we're we're eating all the body horde of Christ and that's our main thing the main focus of the Christian that is today is so easy to get distracted by the other thing you just look around and talk to people and they get so distracted my office telling me that she's listening to people that are all these people that are leaving in the message now disable all these years we didn't know what the message was about and i would agree that's the problem you don't know what the message was about and if somebody said i'm getting this a little bit somebody said I one of the reasons why I don't believe the program was improper was because he didn't give enough credit to Clarence Larkin and they say stole a lot of what Clarence Larkin says well I really got in and study in Clarence Larkin and if you know what got real talk then you can see that he didn't steal that and I'll make a little bit longer i'll get into some of the things like like Clarence Larkin did not understand that the souls innermost being a man he put it body soul and in spirit but now brother Brennan by a holy ghost could and that's a good thing Clarence Marvin didn't understand he he said Christ and the Holy Spirit were two different things no now now now see that programs not getting his message from Clarence Larkin he's getting it from a boat oh this is the message that came down like jesus said I am that bread of life that came down from heaven and that bread of life that came down from heaven was given to us through a trumpet to catch us up to take us to the word we're doing the word now that what he says where the carcass is the Eagles going to gather not the chickens the earth lamb bird the heavenly Eagle will gather with the carcass a chicken is is cousin is down you or Madison everything else can eat with the eagle put some this way up there in a tree nobody can get to that parasites don't bother them they fly too high a lot of predators and roses things is not going about it in he isn't evil they like Eagle food and that's that's the thing i want to focus in this morning this is going to be real simple but Eagles like Eagle food that's what your desire is that's what your nature is to follow after equal for nothing else will satisfy and because you because you're after Eagles for your feeding on the Word of God and then you begin to know who you are what your place is and what the plan is you know where those weather where the rapture is going to take you and how to get there and the chicken don't don't know seeking don't understand anything he's afraid of rats and is what a ride I think it's real funny when I go out and feed our chickens we got this feed bag and sometimes you know if you flap that feedback then it just calls the chaos because if that feedback sounds like eagles wings flapping anything they're going to get evening so they just watch it just is a little bit fun don't tell my wife that she but see there's a difference between the eagle and the chicken now I beseech you brethren mark in Roman 1617 causes now beseech you brother and mark them what cause divisions in the fences contrary to the doctrine which he had learned and avoided they that are such serving on our Lord Jesus cried but the Christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches to see the hearts of the symbol because it I focus is on the word so many today or I put a focus on atmosphere and creating a good song service and things and that's what so many people's focuses on our own legalism and different things but the real word of God will attract a real believer and that's what will take us interaction and you can see I'm getting on the tube you know grandpa target it's 3 believers a real believer and make believe you're an unbeliever and out all down through the scripture that is the two side by side as you go to lamb and governor and the crew and a raven there's disease too and it's real close at the end time and the way did you tell the way that you tell it is by the word you got and you know all down to the scripture of a puppet through growing up you know you hear people say giving the word test until it almost becomes such a common thing and I'm to give them the word test means I see if you if you believe my own opinion but you have you know take it back to the scripture and take it back to work messages and compare it to what the Bible the Bible sensing you know but what what this is speaking of i believe is today nobody understood so many don't understand the real essence of the message so we school let me try to come up with little distractions and things like like well they'll mention that John 666 and no things in the future there are interesting and but there you know it pulls your focus from the essence of the message the essence of the scripture that gets the statue a perfect man that what was the vid hidden the seals and God was revealed himself in flesh to take us to making manifest again as a son of man on this last day so that so that we can take a body change now that's the essence of the message that I really got inspired by something way seven liters speaking because he was talking he made mention of that bit that so many fail to see the essence of the message that and I absolutely agree i think that's that just that just really grieves me and excites me at the same time that so many are failing to see what god is doing in this day the loop will all sit at Secca current is 11 3 but I fearless by any means as a serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ now see we don't want some neva grand and complicated and Hughes but it's real simple that that scripture where the carcass is that equal to be gather together that's real simple but we don't want that we want something I'll complicate complicated and a big to-do emotion and and and and and a lot of distractions instead of just getting them and it can it be as simple as brother I'm saying read your Bible every day and pray pray pray program how do I get closer to God well you know where you go you know to purchase a thousand books or different theologians and things but it's as simple as read your Bible every day and pray pray pray but because we fail to see the simplicity in Christ call afraid that will be beguiled to the sub tility of the serpent they come in and get us distracted from the real pure Word of God for if he that cometh pritchett another Jesus Emily I'm not priests or if you receive out of spirit which you have not received and or another gospel which you have not accepted you might you might well bear with I'm afraid if someone comes in teaching something this contractor work you'll put up with you put up with what with the nonsense for I suppose I was not a whit but not a very chiefest apostles now I love this scripture because everybody likes to quote what Paul says how I was a sheep's of sinners and everything but here your palms making this confession and that's what will offend everybody when the bride begins to realize who she is and says I and my father are one and I do nothing but the will of the Father and all these thank you so when he comes he's making a statement a confession that he knows what he places I was not a whit behind the very key first apostles oh my goodness how are you making something longer sick and that's the same thing they said a brother random Hickam just like Paul came with an angel and a cloud and a pillar of fire and all these things he's not making something of himself he's showing he showing the people a message but though I be rude and speech yet not acknowledge but we have been truly made manifest among you and all things like uh was it was a Nathaniel came whomping to jesus and jesus said behold here's a man and whom there is different it has no God I can see right through and there's no deception it's just right playing out and open and I believe that's how the gospel should be preached it should be preached and simplicity just made benefit just but made plain so that you can you can make your own decision about it not me not on complicated and not trying to drum up something fancy but just the Word of God is what will attract the Eagles attention it'll attract a big fish for green and that's what's going to take us interaction and then the ones at the end time when he said Moses was an eagle they never give the children of God knoweth leftovers he had the fresh Word of God now now I was read through on what Martin Luther had to say he wrote this thing about the seven marks of the body church how the church would be identified and the very first thing was he said the first first the holy Christian people are recognized by their possession of the whole word of god and i agree with that because that's what identifies a Christian in this day and every day now Paul had the word for his day that see it you got to say what the messenger saving you own a Martin Luther change you had to say what the messenger saying could come up with something new order that's the same thing in this day we can't come up with some newfangled ideas something additional to what he said because everything that he said he gave us everything we need to get in to take a body change we don't need to add anything to it will need to come up with was strange little types or and strangely shadows and things that he did put there because we're we're uh we're recognized by receiving the word for our day and the mana is the word that's where the he was to get it now you know look at these two is to kind of characters the dough and the Raven they live as they left from the art that the water began to recede know enough to the arc any left uh no balloons then let the ravenous and their character showed where they were attracted to you now now the Raven likes the word to the rainy could eat the work but one has gone he ever done that the Dove he'll kill him if he eats stuff of the world false doctrine things that he shouldn't be that I need to tent there's something in him that will attract him you know brother Brendan compared he even use that too tight of a bank's line Christian that uh there's so many times that he he prepared in this little story and say the dog went out and tried to find food before the water and preceded him and it wasn't nothing nothing but trash it came back and couldn't stomach it it came back to the ark and that's the same way with a backslidden Christian will do you and get a little bit sliding to the bible reading prayer life anything you try try to satisfy with something else it just can't stomach it because of killing there's something inside having this job until the real word of god and you can't stand it so you're basically going to circle back or like that that brother that was drinking beer everything God just take you off the scene cause you're not nervous it's not right but but look these two nature's now one can stomach the things of the world and when the other one cannot and there's the story he simple if the Raider ones worth went forth to and fro into the waters were dried up from off the earth but the dog found the rest for the sole of her foot and she would turn into mmv are now I just I just want to expose these two natures and think about this a little bit because you know you say well I just can't harvest and Elizabeth Brown I don't I don't like to listen to the tapes and the books and pink and I just can't only find time to do it maybe it i hate i hate the sound of roughing everything but maybe examine your nature because you know you can look at free will others interested in story three wheels as you've got you got a choice but that Raven and you don't have the nature to choose right to do right your free will is to a great extent governed by that nature thank God puts inside of me until God puts his nature inside of you you can't you can't fake it I mean you can fake it you try to like that store where he try to put Rowan talk about putting the fake feathers in I'll hood all the fake feathers in here you'd like the Raven could Michael insurance and say well i'm in church i listen to the same certainly love is here i am but but there's something that inside is just not crazy like what psalm 42 or david but that's an example of prayer time for tuna I think that's where these he says the dealer payment after water book and then it was a scripture up that one of the verses hasn't he Portwenn any cravings and I pour my soul out that because there's something alone and something deep Colin to eat its without the word being inside you living then you you can't there's nothing to really pull and draw all that debt to draw you toward a word that's that's the difference between the dough and the rain here's the nature of the duck James 317 the wisdom that is from a bow that with them through God his first pure than peaceful gentleman he could it be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without talking she and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace a limb that make peace because now now a lot of people get confused when they read isn't anything that ad of nature is a pushover but a dove is trying to fulfill the word of god that's what he's attracted to he's attracted to God's Word painful field now that's why Jesus will go into the temple and pick up cat o nine tails and whatever he picked up and can whip the people out because he was interested and seeing God's Word fulfilled so I naked on nature in a man in a person the dog is at the nature of Christ the Dove is wanting to see God's Word fulfilled now push it over not somebody will just take whatever so I just wrote some notes down the dub moves past environmental distractions and that's what I believe her for the Vernon was pretty nylon lining and you know because you will get some centered on what somebody does does I made sure that hurts our feelings will build up complexes we'll look at what other people do scarecrows to the church different things or functional Social Affairs like what we start treating the treatment search like a social gathering instead of place where you can come into the Word of God but what a dumb is really it don't matter how many people hurt you feel is everything that does is going barrel past all that and get to the word that you know that that really hurts but I've got to get to the word England if the word is behind a whole football team of scarecrows and her feelings and complex is everything a nomadic to the dub it is is going to bail right on through and get to it cause that's that is what attracts the Dove lamb the Eagle all these little animals another Raven you know one of the right some of these characteristics of rape a ravenous is they say Raiders are even more intelligent and then apparent they can I e-courses illegal to own one but if you could you know they'll be a really interesting bird go home because they can they think I almost think they're so smart and things they can choose if you asked to give me the green block and things they can pick the right ball but it tells us you can be real intelligent and get off of Word of God and just miss the whole thing it's not how intelligent you are it's didn't believe God's Word and then think of that the Ravens one of the meanest birds that's what program said and he can eat wheat but he can also the trash now look when when the no were released that dove that Raven out of the are there was a all that detritus and decaying stuff laying out there from all those cattle and all those people that have died it was always sitting out there decayed and the filth and that's what the ravening here he'd go hideous doing that and it didn't kick because his nature wasn't change there was something in him there wasn't it wasn't that nature to draw into the word my brother I said in first woman God the Holy Therns to be like him and then you see that his word is in you vindicating itself that you are God's servant now that's what attracts Christian is when you see God's Word being vindicated something change something taking place let me kind of jump ahead a little bit see the harvest steinberger and said look being gone after adamant Phil tried by order filter on continued in his creation to try to find a man who would live every word now look he tried to find me that is live the word for his age now you see God scattered his word out cause of tooth he's trying to find somebody it's a personal affair he's trying to find somebody that will get will make your word manifest see how close me there's a goat and lamb and look look at this quote brother I'm said an angel / back in 1951 it's if you better get sealing the kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost while you got a chance you talked about the fusing time isn't coming when the Bible said they'd be so close till it will see the very leg if possible hey remember we talked about sunday school lessons about how Babel is confusion and everything now that you get into the Word of God and what's confusing is to melt away into what and the simplicity of the word of God and you'll begin to understand it's not it's not supposed to be confusing look here's another nature of it the devil wants to be paid it takes a real cheap razor another difference when it bleed of a god go to the land the devil wants to be petty gotta get that nature change so that your focus is on the Word of God not so much being patted and and having everything your way and they prefer being struck the right way but it open you know a lot of these little things of life I believe when we look back when we get a room upside we look back and say whoa well you know it that Burleson got mad because I mean I here we are we're living eternal life forever ever with God and we're just getting along and this is so wonderful and then we can take that mindset of how wonderful it's going to be then and apply now just look around maybe change our the way we look at things all I know penny feelings don't matter at all compared to what I have not seen know you're hurt what's in store for those are loving and see a land was willing to forfeit its rice a mile and makes war will I try a lamb has to be led and let us go to leave lambs to the slaughter didn't jump out why cause he ain't committee he's not he's not interested in going all the way to the cross hill hill you know lead the lamps of the slaughter and then jump out and say well I wasn't really interested in this journey that you don't and a lamb knows the Shepherd's voice because he's interested in the world cup John 10 45 he said we put forth his own shoe the phone and she following for they know his voice and a stranger will they not followed but will flee from you will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers anything that's off the voice of God now here's what I really like hold your panties because this is this is key right here God can make you a different nature man or woman say well I y'all free clean everything and maybe don't see what the word and we'll God can change change you from home free click over to to you can change it from a raven to to the middle or come on from I go to a lamb we know a lot of people who looked really don't believe that but that's the whole principle of the message that's the whole principle of the Gospels I godkin God can insert himself by a word the word have gone a shopping ensure a soldier shy because his nature inside of you by his word slicing and dicing and cutting everything off and ain't supposed to be there and I believe it that's that's the mob my whole Christian experience is based upon i once was lost but now I'm found I once had a horrible nature and now he's put his nature now see I've been I've been reaping I really wasn't rational amount like two or three times me and and that's what the whole focus of this reflected is the lesson is this more than what attracts what attracts to do the devil is attracted by God fulfilling his word it's God making a history are fulfilling prophecy now the thing is a cosmic and history for the prophecy today right now even though you might not see it that always causes an attraction what's on the power of prophecy is being fulfilled Jesus came to over the Mount of Olives and all the people rain seeing that the doves and ravens and the goats and the Lambs and everybody came but the dogs and the Lambs were really interested and following all the way through seeing what God what God was going to be with this little man that everybody thought was just riding on a donkey I add this is description that we got all playing with I am The Living bread which came down from heaven and here he said the words that I spree this wind up I'm running out of time again oh goodness when I went when you know Jesus began to tell the disciples and said to eat my flesh and drink my blood and they got all feed it is because they can't understand said it's the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profit nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are alive and that's what a Christian lives by is buying word it should come to pass in that well I might as well go ahead and stop right now he's been getting some something twisted thanks but I think I'll see you around
