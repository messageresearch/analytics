[0:00] you like me talking right now I'm having
[0:02] to think of a thought and I can't just
[0:04] transmit it to youall I have to use
[0:06] words it has to come from here into
[0:08] words and to try to state in a way yall
[0:10] will understand it that's right and then
[0:11] y'all have to listen to it and not think
[0:13] about the color time wearing or not
[0:15] think about what you're going e for
[0:16] lunch not get distracted by all these
[0:18] other things you have to listen to it
[0:20] and then there's also you can
[0:22] misinterpret what I'm saying so there's
[0:24] a lot of barriers there's a lot of
[0:25] primitive ways of our communicating in
[0:28] in the form that we're in but yet it's
[0:29] the way that God chose for us to receive
[0:31] him back before he was descended
[0:35] condescended into locost who's going to
[0:37] understand that you know there's
[0:39] absolutely no way for us to for anybody
[0:41] to receive the Revelation or
[0:43] understanding of such a great big God in
[0:44] that form so he had to come down and
[0:47] with that in that locost that Revelation
[0:49] form or that condescending form of god
[0:52] father and son if you will in that sun
[0:54] form also I believe came language and he
[0:57] began to uh and he gives us a free
[0:59] language
[1:00] so that when you grow up and reate
[1:03] accountability you can begin to receive
[1:05] God through that because faith comes by
[1:08] hearing right and hearing by the word
[1:10] and you know I think the Bible refers to
[1:12] it as the foolishness of preaching I'm
[1:13] not sure why I guess it was Paul that
[1:15] said the foolishness of preaching see I
[1:16] think it's kind of like I said primitive
[1:18] it's foolishness this idea of make
[1:22] thinking of a thought instead of just
[1:23] zapping it into your head I have to come
[1:25] up with words to try to express it God
[1:28] is so far Supreme and so far beyond that
[1:31] and you know brother Dell and many
[1:33] ministers stand up there A lot of times
[1:34] and say I wish I could just you know
[1:37] basically open your head and pour pour
[1:38] in the thought because all this this
[1:40] foolishness of talking to try to get you
[1:43] to see what I'm saying it's so difficult
[1:45] and but yet that's that's the way that
[1:47] we have to receive God but God opened
[1:49] that way when he gives a baby a free
[1:51] language as an infant they seem so you
[1:55] know lacking in their IQ and yet they're
[1:57] learning a language that's got to be a
[1:58] miracle because any one of us in here to
[2:00] tries to learn second language it's hard
[2:02] sure but yet it seems like they just
[2:04] pick it up like they don't even think
[2:06] about it MH and I believe that's God
[2:08] absolutely opening away and he even
[2:10] gives it to a baby before they reach the
[2:12] stage of accountability so they can
[2:14] begin to receive bits and pieces along
[2:16] the way before they get to that point it
[2:18] could just let us wait till we're
[2:19] already at that age where we have to
[2:21] make the decision and then later on in
[2:24] life say oh by the way here's some
[2:25] language so you can begin to receive me
[2:27] no he begins to let them have language
[2:30] as a baby so that their parents can
[2:32] teach them the bible teach them Bible
[2:34] stories and teach them things about God
[2:37] and they can begin to contemplate and
[2:38] then when they come to the age of
[2:39] accountability where they know right and
[2:40] wrong and they can begin to choose the
[2:43] right or wrong they can make their own
[2:44] choice then the freedom all ages so you
[2:48] know I think it's just phenomenal and
[2:49] it's miraculous and it's something I
[2:51] think we Overlook but I believe that
[2:53] came out of and I'll have to you know
[2:55] talk to Brother D about that I should
[2:56] have talked to him first before I
[2:57] brought that out but anyway the
[3:00] the point is that I believe with that
[3:01] logos with that ability to understand
[3:04] God came language and are that's an
[3:06] attribute they brought that out yeah you
[3:09] know he brought that attribute out of us
[3:11] speaking and getting from what somebody
[3:14] spoke yeah and so where would we be
[3:16] though if we didn't have language just
[3:18] think about that I mean like I don't
[3:20] know if they really were cavan but let's
[3:21] just say we were cavan all we could do
[3:26] is you know basically eat and sleep you
[3:30] point to a bed I want to sleep point to
[3:31] a meal I want to eat you could even
[3:33] think about receiving God everything
[3:35] that we get about God comes through
[3:37] reading the Bible reading words language
[3:40] and comes through hearing the ministers
[3:41] preach Faith coming by hearing and
[3:43] listening to sermons where will we be
[3:45] without language you
[3:48] know and anyway
[3:51] so I guess that's all I was going to say
[3:53] about that yes I had an experience one
[3:55] time my brother he's very he's very good
[3:59] person he he's very good whatever Church
[4:01] of God or whatever he is and uh I I've
[4:05] talked to him about the message and he
[4:07] said well do y'all believe in speaking
[4:09] in tongues and I said well yeah I said
[4:12] but we don't believe it's the evidence
[4:13] well they do and he said well we believe
[4:17] that you have to speak tongues before
[4:18] you get the Holy Ghost and I and I it
[4:21] had to be God because I never thought of
[4:23] that before but I said Jerry I said do
[4:26] you think God respect her person he said
[4:29] oh no said the Bible says he's not and I
[4:31] said what about a deaf and dumb person
[4:34] that can't talk how they going to get
[4:36] the Holy Ghost if they got to speak in
[4:39] tongues to get it and you know he has
[4:43] never mentioned what we believe or
[4:46] nothing never again but he knew I was
[4:50] right you know I got him that on that
[4:53] one but he's never talked to me about
[4:55] this m and that's been years ago yeah
[4:59] but that's true true like you said to
[5:00] the little boy in the wheelchair I mean
[5:02] you know if you got to do something to
[5:04] get something God's a respector
[5:07] person exactly brother ban said even a
[5:12] illiterate person could be
[5:17] saved I was just thinking to add to what
[5:20] you were so that you could think about
[5:22] this because I was told years ago that
[5:24] it's better for a young child to learn a
[5:27] second language than it is it's easier
[5:30] for them to pick it up and when our last
[5:33] child was in kindergarten he started his
[5:36] Spanish and he had the accent he could
[5:38] roll those RS and you know I I think and
[5:42] I don't know why that is but young
[5:44] people have an easier time we need to
[5:46] teach the little kids new languages and
[5:48] not the the older ones yeah I believe
[5:51] it's the way God's engineered us as
[5:53] children they're in that one little
[5:54] window in our lives we can receive
[5:56] languages maybe even multiple languages
[6:00] little ones don't have all this up
[6:04] stuff at book Speak span you got
[6:08] everything
[6:13] else
[6:14] you it may fall under B law but does
[6:19] desire come under that same
[6:23] diligence you understand the question
[6:25] desire does come under diligence under
[6:28] Bob's law the more you take in just the
[6:32] desire oh I think the desire increases
[6:33] yeah for sure because then you begin to
[6:35] get rep God begins to give you
[6:37] Revelation and the goodness of God lead
[6:39] you to repentance little handfuls of
[6:41] purpose along the way Revelations little
[6:44] bit bitty things that make you desire
[6:45] more of God think the makes
[6:49] you well either
[6:52] way question because you can be lacking
[6:55] desire but you stay with it you have to
[6:58] kind of step out
[7:00] in faith when you're not when you don't
[7:02] desire when you don't desire that much
[7:04] of God and you just leap you know take a
[7:06] leap of faith or you step out and say
[7:08] God I'm going to commit this to you this
[7:09] a little bit of time to you and then
[7:11] he'll reward it and then you say well
[7:12] that worked good so I'll do it
[7:14] again it even more but um as you say in
[7:17] about language I think God have accents
[7:20] to because it might be silly but he will
[7:23] talk to me the
[7:27] language might have to
[7:37] okay good morning good
[7:56] morning is there a PowerPoint looking
[7:58] thing down there that it yeah that's it
[8:04] okay I gave it away
[8:06] sorry that was so yall know what we were
[8:09] talking about but yall already saw
[8:12] it I bet it's diligence it might be be a
[8:19] surprise okay let's pray de Heavenly
[8:23] Father we ask you to bless all that is
[8:25] done today Lord Lord bless us in the

[8:40] Frasier and all those other ones Lord
[8:42] that have been mentioned here lately uh
[8:45] pray you'll help me with the teaching of
[8:46] the Sunday school and just help me to
[8:48] say something to edify and to encourage
[8:50] other believers here I pray we love you
[8:53] and thank you for all your blessings in
[8:54] Jesus name
[8:56] amen now we're going to talk about
[8:58] Thomas
[8:59] C
[9:01] shortly right now we're going to talk
[9:03] about
[9:06] diligence one of my favorite
[9:08] topics so diligence means haste with
[9:13] haste earnestness diligence earnestness
[9:17] and accomplishing promoting or striving
[9:19] after anything to give all diligence
[9:23] interest oneself most
[9:25] earnestly so want to talk about why it's
[9:28] important how you get it
[9:30] and a lot of other things about
[9:32] diligence so first off why is diligence
[9:35] important why do we need diligence it's
[9:38] because we're born lazy we're born
[9:40] slothful right nobody is Born Into the
[9:43] world with just you know desire to just
[9:45] work and strive and push we have to make
[9:47] ourselves do it and if you're going to
[9:49] accomplish anything in life and be
[9:51] successful at anything you have to be
[9:52] diligent okay whether it be serving the
[9:55] lord or in a marriage or in parenting or
[9:58] anything you have to be diligent
[10:02] it's natural to seek pleasure and to
[10:03] seek worldly things not necessarily bad
[10:05] things I'm talking about just things
[10:07] that are more pleasing to the flesh it's
[10:08] more natural to do those things it's not
[10:11] natural to be diligent so it's something
[10:13] you have to desire and you have to
[10:15] strive
[10:16] for okay like seeking and studying the
[10:19] things of God those things don't come
[10:21] naturally it's against our nature you
[10:24] know so our objective
[10:27] is to see that God always rewards
[10:30] diligence and that your efforts are
[10:32] never in
[10:34] vain
[10:36] because part of the reason we don't be
[10:38] diligent some of the time is because we
[10:41] don't feel like there's enough reward
[10:43] you know we don't feel like you know if
[10:45] I if I go out on a lamb and I try to
[10:47] serve the Lord what's in it for me you
[10:49] know what's what good is in it for me so
[10:51] you have to see a value in it sure and
[10:53] we'll talk more about that here in a
[10:54] little bit but our efforts at anything
[10:56] that you pursue in life seems futile or
[11:00] seems useless if you don't see a reward
[11:02] if you don't see something that you will
[11:04] accomplish and you don't see the value
[11:07] in
[11:08] it so God always rewards
[11:13] diligence our natural tendency is to
[11:15] give up when we don't see results
[11:17] quickly however those who are successful
[11:19] at anything are diligent in their
[11:25] efforts
[11:26] okay um a level of perseverance also
[11:30] goes with diligence we should continue
[11:32] on our walk with God not to not
[11:35] expecting to see immediate results be
[11:38] the tortoise not the hair right slow and
[11:41] steady always wins the race I think of
[11:43] the tortoise and hair I think of brother
[11:45] Dale he's very slow and steady but he
[11:48] keeps going no matter what he never
[11:50] backs down he never lets off he keeps
[11:51] driving keeps pushing and we don't have
[11:53] any idea how bad he must feel sometimes
[11:56] up there you know with many things
[11:58] bothering his body and yet he keeps on
[12:00] striving and pushing and he never backs
[12:02] down that's been my theme in life is to
[12:04] don't ever stop don't back down don't
[12:06] don't let up on anything that's right
[12:08] don't quit just keep pushing keep
[12:10] striving no matter if you see results
[12:13] right away or not just keep keep going
[12:15] we always want instant gratification on
[12:17] anything but with God there's not
[12:19] instant gratification most of the time
[12:21] you have to really push and strive to
[12:22] see
[12:24] results so now the hair on the other
[12:26] hand he was the type that that he was
[12:30] complacent because he said well I've got
[12:32] this m look at my opponent you know I
[12:34] can beat him I'll s settle down here and
[12:36] take a nap I'll rest for a while I'll
[12:39] take a break then I'll strive a little
[12:40] bit for a while then I'll back down he's
[12:42] in and out up and down and it makes me
[12:44] think of a lot of the well we'll talk
[12:47] about it more later but a lot of people
[12:49] in the message are that way I feel like
[12:51] they've come into the message and
[12:53] they're waiting on that last seed to
[12:54] come in Waiting on a bus to pull up like
[12:56] brother Dell says waiting on something
[12:58] else to happen somewhere else and
[13:01] instead of realizing that hey I need to
[13:03] get myself ready I need to do all I can
[13:04] to get out of here and strive and push
[13:08] so we are to be the tortoise slow and
[13:10] steady always but never never never give
[13:14] up there are many examples of this in
[13:16] the Bible Noah worked diligently
[13:18] preparing the ark without wavering even
[13:20] against all
[13:21] adversity every believer in the Bible
[13:23] had some level of diligence we too must
[13:25] be diligent and perseverant in serving
[13:28] the lord
[13:33] uh Hebrews
[13:34] 11:6 but without faith it is impossible
[13:37] to please him for he that cometh to God
[13:39] must believe that he is and that he is a
[13:42] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[13:44] him he sees your efforts that are done
[13:46] toward him in secret and he will reward
[13:48] thee openly and I think about ministers
[13:52] especially in this church ministers that
[13:54] study in secret and commit themselves to
[13:56] the Lord and what does what does God do
[13:58] he rewards them openly before all of us
[14:00] these ministers brother Bob brother Wade
[14:02] brother Dell and brother Lis and brother
[14:04] Aaron all of them stand up there and
[14:06] minister to us the things that the
[14:07] Lord's shown to them the Lord's rewarded
[14:09] their diligence with Revelation and they
[14:11] stand up and they can on that to us
[14:14] share with us their
[14:16] Revelation and so God will reward you
[14:19] openly when you study in secret in
[14:22] private and commit yourself to the
[14:25] Lord and frankly that's one of the
[14:27] benefits of being that church it's not
[14:29] just to hear the word not just to have
[14:31] the fellowship with one another but we
[14:33] edify one another and we encourage one
[14:35] another and seeing brother Bob stand up
[14:38] here and upstairs in in church and
[14:40] brother and brother Dale and like I said
[14:42] all the ministers here it inspires me to
[14:44] go study more that's the sermon I like
[14:46] is one that makes me think man I don't
[14:47] know anything I need to go sit down and
[14:49] study for a while I need to seek the
[14:51] Lord for a while you know rather than
[14:54] feeling like I've got this and I think
[14:56] everything's under control and I'm going
[14:57] to take it easy yeah
[15:03] right um all right regarding wisdom
[15:06] Proverbs 4:20 my son attend to my words
[15:10] incline thine ear unto my sayings let
[15:13] them not depart from Thine Eyes keep
[15:15] them in the midst of thine heart for
[15:18] they are life unto those that find them
[15:20] and health to all their flesh keep thy
[15:23] heart with all diligence for out of it
[15:26] are the issues of life
[15:29] okay and
[15:32] U so how do you become diligent I sort
[15:35] of touched on this a minute ago like I
[15:37] said it goes against our
[15:39] nature and as I said you have to see a
[15:42] value in something and this is something
[15:44] that all this time I've been misusing
[15:46] the scripture uh this particular one
[15:51] about addicting themselves to the
[15:53] ministry of the Saints I'll just get
[15:54] down with this verse I beseech you
[15:55] Brethren you know the house of stephanus
[15:58] that it is the first fruits of the and
[16:00] that they have addicted themselves to
[16:02] the ministry of the Saints and I looked
[16:03] that word up addicted in the strong
[16:05] concordance when I was fixing to use the
[16:07] scripture and it actually means ordained
[16:09] or appointed so in other words he's
[16:11] saying uh stephanus the the the house of
[16:15] stepanus these are people who had uh
[16:16] committed themselves to you know
[16:19] ministering to the Saints but I look at
[16:21] it like this also I look at it and
[16:23] considering that I need to addict myself
[16:26] to the 5f ministry addict myself to to
[16:28] listening to these ministers in this
[16:30] church okay I think we need to be
[16:32] committed to and addicted to the
[16:34] ministry so much to where that if we
[16:35] miss a service we go back and listen to
[16:37] it not just once but maybe multiple
[16:39] times like any addiction you have to
[16:41] have it it's something you have to it
[16:43] drives you and it pushes you and you
[16:45] have to have it you can't do without so
[16:48] even though I'm kind of taking that
[16:49] scripture out of context that's that's
[16:51] the way that I've been using that
[16:53] scripture is until I realized that it
[16:55] means something else so right but anyway
[16:57] you addict yourself to the fold
[17:03] Ministry my son Proverbs 21 my son if
[17:07] thou receive my words and hide my
[17:09] Commandments with thee so that thou
[17:11] incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply
[17:14] thine heart to understanding yay if Thou
[17:17] criest after knowledge and liftest up
[17:19] thy voice for understanding if thou
[17:21] seekest her as silver and searches for
[17:24] her as for his
[17:26] treasures and I'll finish that scripture
[17:28] in a minute I'm going to interject this
[17:31] seek Godly wisdom in the same manner
[17:33] that you work diligently for worldly
[17:35] riches perhaps our daily laboring for
[17:37] money can be looked at as an example of
[17:40] how we should also diligently search for
[17:42] Godly wisdom which is of much greater
[17:44] gain than worldly riches I go to work
[17:46] every day I show up early leave late and
[17:49] work hard while I'm there all just to
[17:51] make a living for my family but I think
[17:54] you know God lets us have examples like
[17:56] that in our lives to to help us see him
[17:59] better and how we should serve him
[18:01] that's the same way we have to serve the
[18:02] Lord you know come to church and and
[18:05] read our Bible make ourselves available
[18:06] to him and you know be diligent about
[18:09] serving God in the same way that we
[18:12] would work for worldly riches that's
[18:15] right and
[18:16] he in the rest of that scripture then
[18:20] shalt thou understand the fear of the
[18:22] Lord and find the knowledge of God for
[18:25] the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth
[18:27] cometh knowledge and understanding he
[18:30] layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous
[18:33] he is a to them that walk
[18:35] uprightly
[18:38] yes okay and Proverbs
[18:42] 104 he becometh poor that deal with a
[18:45] slack hand but the hand of the diligent
[18:46] maketh Rich so the word Rich does not
[18:49] only refer to Natural riches but those
[18:51] that are spiritual as well as in many
[18:54] Proverbs and Psalms there's natural and
[18:56] spiritual
[18:57] applications so naturally if you look at
[19:00] it that way you become poor to deal with
[19:01] a slack hand so if you if you don't work
[19:04] in the natural you'll become poor okay
[19:06] you'll be hungry and but also in the
[19:10] natural the hand of the diligent maketh
[19:12] Rich so you'll have what you have need
[19:14] of and and then some maybe if you if
[19:16] you're very diligent in the natural it's
[19:18] your job all right so in the spiritual
[19:20] he becometh poor that deal with a slack
[19:22] hand if you deal with god with a slack
[19:24] hand you'll become poor in Revelation
[19:26] you won't have any and and uh you won't
[19:29] have any of the fruits of the spirit you
[19:30] won't grow up the stature of a perfect
[19:31] man but the hand of the diligent if
[19:34] you're diligent with God he'll make you
[19:36] rich okay and you'll go up the stature
[19:38] of per man and you'll uh gain the fruits
[19:42] of the spirit and grow in God right now
[19:46] we're going to talk about Thomas con k I
[19:47] wasn't kidding about that so Thomas and
[19:51] his wife kette uh they wrote a book
[19:53] called The Many Loves of marriage and I
[19:55] thought there's some good things in
[19:56] there about diligence
[19:58] so I'm going to talk about those for a
[20:00] while and in that book he used this
[20:04] Proverbs 24 and this is
[20:06] Solomon I went by the field of the
[20:09] slothful and by the vineyard of the man
[20:11] void of understanding and lo it was all
[20:13] grown over with thorns and Nettles had
[20:16] covered the face thereof and the stone
[20:19] wall thereof was broken down then I saw
[20:22] and considered it well I looked upon it
[20:24] and received instruction I think it's
[20:27] God's grace to us that he sometimes lets
[20:29] us observe other people's faults and
[20:31] failures instead of letting us go
[20:32] through the thing and he let us observe
[20:35] it and then we gain instruction from
[20:37] that that still small voes speak to us
[20:40] I've observed a certain family member I
[20:41] won't name a certain family member of
[20:43] mine that I've observed over the years
[20:45] to made one mistake after another and
[20:47] I've just said and it hurts me to watch
[20:49] him fall and fail so much but yet at
[20:52] least you know I'm observing from a
[20:55] distance and saying well God show me
[20:56] what's what's wrong with this picture
[20:58] picture so I don't fall in that same
[20:59] trap right so here Solomon was looking
[21:02] at this man who was obviously slothful
[21:05] and now what is a Vineyard it's his
[21:08] livelihood where he gathers his food
[21:11] from and his substance and his uh you
[21:14] know makes the living off of and he was
[21:16] slothful about it so it was as Solomon
[21:19] was saying it was uh grown over with
[21:21] thorns Nettles the wall stone wall was
[21:23] broken down it was just uh backsliding
[21:26] okay because he was sful
[21:33] so uh Thomas and CIS is his word Solomon
[21:36] had the kind of mind that was always
[21:38] asking why and how why had this collapse
[21:40] taken place how had this small wedge of
[21:43] God's Promised Land fallen on such hard
[21:45] times he thought about it perhaps
[21:47] sitting on a rock or standing beside
[21:50] that crumbling wall the great king took
[21:52] it all to heart I applied my heart to
[21:55] what I observed and learned a lesson
[21:57] from what I saw and what did he learn a
[22:00] little sleep a little Slumber a little
[22:02] folding of the hands to rest and poverty
[22:06] will come on you like a bandit and
[22:08] scarcity like an armed man I'm not sure
[22:10] what version that is but we know what it
[22:12] says though King
[22:14] James all right decay occurs in small
[22:16] increments with a devastating cumulative
[22:19] effect kind of like the snow up in the
[22:22] Northeast you know the New England area
[22:24] I don't know if y'all heard about like
[22:25] hundreds of roofs collapsed on people's
[22:27] houses because snow as light as it is if
[22:30] you hold a snowflake in your hand it's
[22:32] so tiny it's almost weightless but if
[22:33] there's millions of them accumulating on
[22:35] a roof of a house it'll collapse in and
[22:39] when it comes to Gardens Vineyards and
[22:41] the relationship between a husband and
[22:43] wife it doesn't take much neglect to
[22:45] bring poverty and loss to your own front
[22:49] door and then this is Nanette his wife
[22:52] my parents would often remind me that
[22:55] the first rule of gardening is diligence
[22:57] you just just have to be there every day
[22:59] to water to weed to prune to fertilize
[23:01] to guard against invading armies of
[23:03] aphids caterpillars spiderm snails and a
[23:06] host of other Relentless enemies without
[23:09] such VI vigilance the only Gardens
[23:11] anyone would ever see would be the
[23:13] two-dimensional kind in one of Thomas's
[23:14] paintings in other words you just see
[23:16] pictures of Dino Gardens it's the same
[23:18] in a marriage unless you're watchful
[23:21] actively cultivating the relationship
[23:23] working at it with wide open eyes and an
[23:25] inent of heart it will begin to fall
[23:27] into ruin just a little sleep a little
[23:29] Slumber a little folding of the hands in
[23:32] other words it doesn't take very long
[23:33] for a garden to go to see or to
[23:36] die just a little bit of compromise a
[23:38] little bit of
[23:40] selfishness a little bit of a ho hum
[23:42] attitude and that place of Duty and
[23:44] refuge begins to crumble right
[23:47] before or right before your eyes Thorns
[23:51] everywhere the ground covered with weeds
[23:53] the stone wall and ruins marriage is
[23:56] just as much an action as a state of
[23:59] being it's
[24:00] a verb not just some sleepy noun that
[24:04] collects dust and rust it's a consuming
[24:07] ongoing activity it is life
[24:10] itself I've had friends tell me well
[24:12] it's sad but my marriage just fell apart
[24:15] they speak as if it were something
[24:16] inevitable and
[24:18] unavoidable as someone might say it
[24:20] rained last night or that last
[24:22] earthquake cracked our foundation but it
[24:24] isn't so we are not passive victims of
[24:27] circum St no matter what our warp
[24:29] self-absorbed culture may say you know
[24:31] everybody says today everybody's always
[24:33] talking about I'm a victim I'm a victim
[24:35] of our government I'm a victim of the U
[24:38] you know getting the money call it
[24:42] economy being bad okay I'm a victim of
[24:43] this I'm victim of that I can't the
[24:45] little man can't the little man can't
[24:47] get a head you always hear people say
[24:48] yeah that's a victim mentality okay and
[24:53] uh when in reality it's I think it's an
[24:55] excuse to be lazy for a lot of people if
[24:57] they just get up and do uh something
[24:59] diligent you know just work and strive
[25:01] and struggle and push they wouldn't
[25:03] accomplish the same things that you know
[25:05] doctors and lawyers and all the very
[25:07] accomplished people have accomplished
[25:09] it's a law of God is what it goes down
[25:10] to the law called diligence he says he
[25:13] didn't even say it's just for Christians
[25:15] God's laws work for non-christians as
[25:17] well if they would just commit and be
[25:19] diligent about something just commit to
[25:21] something then you'd be successful in it
[25:24] eventually um awesome place
[25:29] okay could you imagine hearing a
[25:32] professional Gardener say sigh deeply
[25:34] and say something like this well you
[25:36] know it's so unfortunate but my garden
[25:39] that little half acre I've worked on for
[25:40] years suddenly failed I walked outside
[25:43] yesterday morning and would you believe
[25:44] it it was all overgrown the place was
[25:47] chest high with weeds and aphids were
[25:49] chewing up everything inside it really
[25:52] gets me down and you'd have to say
[25:54] friend Where Have You Been was your
[25:56] garden really that important to you
[25:58] after all or did you just tell yourself
[26:00] it was where have you been
[26:03] pouring your time where have you been
[26:06] devoting your energies and your
[26:07] creativity beautiful gardens don't go to
[26:09] Sea overnight and neither do once loving
[26:12] marriages one of the many loves of
[26:14] marriage is a diligent attentive love
[26:17] that refuses to ignore those little
[26:18] things that keep Love In Full Bloom
[26:22] someone once said that it's a little
[26:24] it's the little things that determine
[26:25] the big things just think of the daily
[26:27] that takes place on Bo 747 little screws
[26:31] tightened little levers oiled little
[26:33] fuel lines checked little instruments
[26:35] calibrated why because if one more of
[26:38] those small things is neglected a jumbo
[26:41] jet could suddenly fall out of the
[26:44] sky in the same way small areas of
[26:47] neglect can do uncountable damage to a
[26:49] marriage one researcher asks the
[26:51] question how does a couple get from a
[26:54] fight about washing dishes to Legal
[26:56] arguments in divorce for
[26:58] it's the Snowball Effect again I was
[26:59] talking about snow a while ago how it
[27:01] accumulates on a roof builds and builds
[27:03] and builds until it finally is
[27:06] devastating when little things that
[27:08] couples fight about aren't properly
[27:09] dealt with they can develop into larger
[27:11] problems how couples manage the small
[27:13] stuff may be a key factor in whether
[27:16] they achieve long-term conjugal bliss
[27:19] all that's all
[27:24] that Proverbs 134
[27:30] the soul of the sluger desireth and
[27:32] haveth nothing but the soul of the
[27:33] diligent shall be made fast again think
[27:36] of the natural and spiritual
[27:38] applications on both of these the
[27:40] thoughts uh Proverbs 215 the thoughts of
[27:42] the diligent tend only to
[27:45] plenteousness but of everyone that is
[27:47] Hasty only to
[27:49] one now we are for free moral agents we
[27:52] get to choose whether we are diligent or
[27:54] slothful it's our choice we get to make
[27:56] the decision on that and we can be
[27:58] influenced by one way or another but we
[28:01] make the ultimate decision yes so and I
[28:05] just wrote this foolish virgins sit down
[28:08] and wait they sit and wait wise virgins
[28:11] work and endure there's a difference
[28:12] between being patient and waiting you
[28:16] know patient you can be working and
[28:18] striving and pushing to grow in God and
[28:20] be yet patient waiting on God to fulfill
[28:22] the promises while you're not just
[28:25] sitting and waiting that's right you
[28:26] know there's a there's a lot of people I
[28:28] think in the message that I've observed
[28:30] that are just literally sitting and
[28:31] waiting you see it in their lives
[28:32] they're not striving for anything
[28:34] they're not pushing they're not trying
[28:35] to go on with God
[28:40] that all right there is a level of
[28:43] perseverance and patience that goes
[28:45] along with having diligence you must be
[28:47] determined perseverant to make it
[28:49] through and patiently endure to obtain
[28:52] the
[28:53] promise okay and I'm going read some
[28:56] quotes of this is from the message
[28:58] perseverance in 62 or 218 now
[29:01] perseverance to be perseverant to try to
[29:03] make a goal trying to you've got your
[29:06] mind set on something and you're
[29:08] persistent in it because you believe
[29:11] it's the thing that you want and you
[29:12] believe you can get it now pardon me to
[29:15] be persistent you've got your mind made
[29:17] up now that what you're going to do now
[29:20] you cannot have faith in God without
[29:22] knowing the word of God or knowing
[29:24] something about God that's right right
[29:27] and also another perseverance message in
[29:29] 62520 then I got to thinking on
[29:31] perseverance and I thought yes many a
[29:34] man is perseverant before you can be
[29:36] perseverant you have to have faith in
[29:38] what you're trying to achieve you've got
[29:40] to First have faith before you can be
[29:42] perseverant so faith and perseverance
[29:45] Works hand in hand together they are
[29:46] brothers You Must Believe or you'll have
[29:49] no you have no confidence you won't know
[29:52] whether you're right or wrong but when
[29:55] you have reached that place that you
[29:57] have faith in what you're going and what
[29:58] you're trying to do then you can be
[30:03] persevering and uh let's see
[30:06] perseverance back the one back in on May
[30:09] 20th uh she was persistent she stayed
[30:13] all day the Undertaker's calling for her
[30:15] baby oh this is about the lady that was
[30:17] had her baby die that morning brother R
[30:19] prayed for the baby that evening and
[30:21] revive uh she was P persistent she
[30:24] stayed all day the Undertaker calling
[30:25] for a baby she stayed all day anyhow the
[30:27] Usher trying to keep her out of line and
[30:30] she stayed anyhow turned down every way
[30:33] she stayed why she had first why Faith
[30:37] caught a hold Faith said it's so and
[30:39] Faith knows no difficult Faith knows no
[30:41] defeat when you got faith you have
[30:49] perseverance and then uh from the
[30:52] 0218 uh sometimes Faith makes you act
[30:56] ridiculous to the carnal mind but if
[30:57] God's word if it's God's word it's got
[31:00] to come to pass be perseverant see God
[31:03] make it come to pass now Joshua
[31:08] 22:5 but of heed to do the commandment
[31:11] and the law which Moses the servant of
[31:13] the Lord charged you to love the Lord
[31:15] your God and to walk in all his ways and
[31:17] to keep his Commandments and to cleave
[31:19] unto him and to serve him with all your
[31:21] heart and with all your
[31:26] soul okay I got to head myself on these
[31:28] notes while I go so I'll Skip One Note
[31:31] here uh I think I've got time for a
[31:34] brief story this is something that God
[31:36] dealt with me and uh years ago y'all
[31:38] know we go to Kentucky pretty often and
[31:42] the way we do it is when I get off work
[31:44] on a Friday I come home whatever time it
[31:46] is and get ready and then we leave and
[31:48] go up there and then we stay for the
[31:50] weekend and come back home Sunday night
[31:52] well several years ago there was a boy
[31:55] at brother Dani gon D Church dating one
[31:57] of Gabby's sisters in Kentucky so he was
[32:00] going to ride with us up to Kentucky for
[32:02] the weekend to visit with her so I got
[32:05] off work came rushing home and trying to
[32:07] hurry up and get ready and Gabby was
[32:09] slowing me down and saying you know what
[32:11] uh Jacob's not here yet the boy's name
[32:12] is Jacob he was going to ride with us
[32:14] she said Jacob's not here yet you can
[32:15] calm down take your time slow down and I
[32:18] said you know what when he comes if I'm
[32:19] not ready we're not going so I've got to
[32:22] get ready too cuz I was a long ways away
[32:24] from being ready so uh the point is this
[32:27] God began to deal with me on that and I
[32:28] began to see an example of a spiritual
[32:31] problem in the message that where again
[32:34] the last seed syndrome I guess where so
[32:37] many people are sitting and waiting for
[32:38] that last seed to come in not realizing
[32:40] that if that last seed comes in and I'm
[32:42] not ready we're not going so the point
[32:45] is don't sit down be diligent keep
[32:47] striving and pushing because when he
[32:49] does come or she whoever that last seed
[32:51] is if we're not ready then we're not
[32:54] going they might come in and get ready
[32:56] and then we're still getting ready MH so
[32:59] and it's funny because we go up north to
[33:01] Kentucky so we're waiting on that last
[33:03] seed to come in so we could go up in
[33:05] that
[33:08] example good story thank you so put this
[33:13] law of God call diligence to work for
[33:15] you for it is God's word and cannot fail
[33:17] be diligent in your marriage
[33:19] relationships with family and friends
[33:21] and your finances and your health and
[33:24] above all in your relationship and walk
[33:25] with our Lord
[33:27] he is ever faithful and will not let
[33:29] your diligence go unnoticed but will
[33:32] reward your efforts bountifully yes now
[33:35] I'm going to revert back again I think I
[33:37] may mention this before but you know
[33:38] brother Bob mentioned a long time ago he
[33:40] said I made a little Discovery quote
[33:42] unquote little discovery that the more I
[33:44] study and read and pray and seek the
[33:45] Lord the more I grow and you think well
[33:48] duh but that's not really that common
[33:50] sense you really have to strive and TR
[33:52] yourself before you really come to see
[33:54] that that's really true so Bob's little
[33:56] discovery I've named it Bob's law it's
[34:00] actually not Bob's law it's God's law
[34:02] but there's really a lot of truth to it
[34:04] and it's really good God's law of sewing
[34:06] and reaping is what it is you get out of
[34:08] something what you put into it that's
[34:10] right you get out of your relationship
[34:11] with God what you put into it that's
[34:13] right
[34:17] okay objective review so do you see that
[34:22] God always rewards diligence and that
[34:23] your efforts are never in
[34:25] vain
[34:28] that's my last
[34:30] slide is that clock fast or slow you
[34:32] started early I started too
[34:35] early okay well let's see I've got
[34:39] something here that has nothing to do
[34:41] with this
[34:43] subject the only reason I wrote it down
[34:45] is cu when I was studying the other
[34:46] night I started thinking about this so
[34:48] I'll mention it to y'all
[34:51] and I don't know if I want to just read
[34:53] it all or just tell you hang on a
[34:55] minute just start just start just start
[34:59] I might say
[35:01] anything um all right brother Dell has
[35:03] been preaching about the low Goos that
[35:05] came down out of God right the great
[35:07] Elohim that dwelt alone with all his
[35:10] attributes all botted up in him and how
[35:13] can anybody understand that that's been
[35:14] one of my favorite things about what
[35:16] brother benam talked about is that logos
[35:17] condescending from God God condescending
[35:19] to another form so we can begin to
[35:21] understand him and I got to think about
[35:23] the other day have y'all ever thought
[35:25] about that babies learn a language and
[35:28] how uh miraculous that is that an infant
[35:32] with as little IQ as they have and
[35:34] little ability as they have get a free
[35:36] be everybody gets a free language
[35:38] besides you know mental retardation
[35:40] certain circumstances that hinder and
[35:42] deformities and things which you know I
[35:44] believe those people I know somebody in
[35:46] Kentucky a young fell that's in a
[35:48] wheelchair has been confined to a
[35:50] wheelchair it's whole life and he's
[35:51] probably 18 I've know him I guess since
[35:53] he was about eight and he's always been
[35:56] in wheelchair he doesn't hardly really
[35:58] speak anything he's he never really
[36:00] learned to speak and his parents will
[36:02] probably be taken care of him until the
[36:04] day he dies or until they they die then
[36:06] give him off to somebody else well
[36:08] people like that are special and they
[36:09] will be I I believe given a free way to
[36:12] heaven cuz God didn't give them any way
[36:14] to receive him so he wouldn't be just to
[36:17] send them to hell because they passed
[36:19] the age of accountability and didn't get
[36:20] saved you know so but people like that
[36:23] aside from those cases you think of a
[36:25] baby been learning I've been trying to
[36:27] learn Spanish for over a decade I
[36:29] started in high school I didn't really
[36:31] care about it I just had to take a a
[36:33] language class of some sort so I chose
[36:35] Spanish because I thought what use is
[36:36] French those are the only two choices we
[36:38] had and I was like I don't know many
[36:39] French people so I'll learn Spanish and
[36:42] SE any so I tried to learn some Spanish
[36:45] but I didn't really commit myself to it
[36:47] so I came through two semesters of that
[36:48] just knew the basics and that was it
[36:50] just enough to pass and then years later
[36:52] I started uh working with a lot of
[36:54] Hispanics and so I gradually learned one
[36:56] word here and one word there and finally
[36:58] recently I got some Spanish CDs and
[37:00] started really committing myself to
[37:02] trying to learn Spanish to become fluent
[37:03] I'm still not fluent but I've learned a
[37:06] lot but yet I began to realize how hard
[37:08] it is to learn language as a 30-year-old
[37:10] man it's hard it's taking me years to
[37:12] try to learn Spanish a second language
[37:14] but I picked up English you know just
[37:17] without even really trying and there's
[37:19] IA she doesn't really speak much of
[37:21] anything yet but in by the time she's
[37:23] four years old she'll be fluent in
[37:24] English you know the point is this God
[37:28] made a way for us to receive him and I
[37:31] believe with that logos when when that
[37:33] logos came out of God there was Speech
[37:35] there was Revelation there was you know
[37:38] an ability for man to begin to
[37:40] understand God but what else was with
[37:41] that was and I don't know brother Bell
[37:43] said this yet I haven't caught him
[37:44] saying it yet but speech uh language
[37:47] came forth from God and you know if you
[37:51] think about how primitive we are in our
[37:53] ability
