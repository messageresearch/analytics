[2:35] let's just pray are we that all of
[2:37] meetings we got
[2:39] tried to give them an order where we'd
[2:40] remember them
[2:43] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[2:45] day in your grace and love
[2:47] we know and realize without you there
[2:49] wouldn't be nothing here anyway
[2:52] you created all things and everything is
[2:54] for your being and your point that you
[2:57] desire for us to be is what we want to
[2:59] be
[3:00] and we ask you to just help us guide us
[3:03] now forgive our sins cleanse us and
[3:06] guide us and as we speak about you Lord
[3:08] you come on the scene and you manifest
[3:11] yourself through what we're trying to
[3:13] speak about
[3:14] and just have your way we love you Lord
[3:16] thank you for everything
[3:18] and just bless all the sick among us we

[3:29] and to heal each one Lord you promised
[3:31] it so we believe it you said that you
[3:34] sent your word and healed us
[3:36] father we know you sent your word so now
[3:38] the healing has got to be there in The
[3:40] Virtue to follow have your way with us
[3:42] now as we read your word you come and
[3:45] speak to us in Jesus name
[3:47] amen
[3:51] so we'll go to Matthew
[3:55] 13 36.
[3:57] remember you go back over
[4:00] um in the beginning of Matthew and it'll
[4:02] be the uh the second mystery that this
[4:05] is the mystery explain so it's reason
[4:06] we're going that way
[4:08] then Jesus sent the multitude away and
[4:10] went into the house and his disciples
[4:12] came unto him saying declare unto us the
[4:14] parable of the towers of the field
[4:16] he answered and said unto them he that
[4:19] soweth the good seed is the son of man
[4:22] the field is the world the good seed are
[4:25] the children of the Kingdom
[4:27] but the tires are the children of the
[4:30] wicked one
[4:32] the enemy that sowed them is the devil
[4:35] the Harvest is the end of the world and
[4:38] the reapers are the Angels and therefore
[4:41] the tires are gathered and burned in the
[4:43] fire
[4:44] so shall it be in the end of this world
[4:47] the son of man shall send forth his
[4:49] angels and they Shall Gather out of his
[4:52] kingdom all things that offend
[4:55] and then which do iniquity now notice
[4:59] the angels from the son of man were what
[5:03] gather out of this Kingdom you're gonna
[5:05] they're gonna drive him out of it
[5:08] uh you know
[5:10] and shall cast him into a furnace of
[5:12] fire there shall be weeping and gnashing
[5:15] of teeth then shall the righteous shine
[5:17] forth as the son in the Kingdom
[5:20] of their father who hath an ear to hear
[5:23] Let Him hear now let's go over to Luke
[5:26] and just read the one we were reading
[5:27] this morning the one verse 24 Luke 21
[5:30] 24. and they shall fall by the edge of
[5:33] the sword
[5:34] and shall be a letter away captivity
[5:37] into all nations and we know that
[5:39] happened back Yonder you know woe unto
[5:41] them that are with child and give Shook
[5:44] and all that was back to her and Titus
[5:47] coming forth in A.D 70
[5:49] and surrounding Jerusalem and then what
[5:55] in Jerusalem shall be trodden down of
[5:57] the Gentiles unto all the time of the
[5:59] Gentiles be finished you may be seated
[6:02] the Lord at his Blessing to the reading
[6:05] of the word
[6:07] now not to back up a lot but
[6:10] for those who maybe won't hear
[6:14] uh
[6:15] this morning to make sure that they know
[6:17] kind of what we're talking about and to
[6:20] get our minds into the right Channel
[6:22] because that's what we want
[6:24] uh
[6:26] we were talking about this morning and
[6:28] we'll keep the same title this afternoon
[6:29] we'll stay with the title of
[6:31] dispensations
[6:35] and uh we read here in Luke that it says
[6:37] in the time
[6:39] of the Gentiles the prophet used it and
[6:42] said in the dispensation of the Gentiles
[6:46] so then that was my point was trying to
[6:48] get us to this morning to look at it
[6:49] that dispensation deals with a time wise
[6:53] that we're looking at are you know
[6:55] what's taking place in in the day and uh
[7:00] dispensation more or less refers to lack
[7:02] of stewardships or something like that
[7:05] is the natural word or even pulling from
[7:08] the Greek
[7:09] and it doesn't give I believe the true
[7:11] meaning of what we need to see
[7:13] but I you know I'm not trying to change
[7:16] anything I'm trying to speak of what is
[7:20] there in the word that it is the time of
[7:23] the Gentiles
[7:24] the dispensation or the times and I'm
[7:27] trying to get our point to looking at
[7:28] times
[7:30] and not looking at something that what
[7:32] wouldn't not fit together with all of
[7:34] the word of God
[7:36] and uh
[7:37] that way see it's all got to fit because
[7:40] the Bible can't as I said this morning
[7:42] you can't see if you say well brother
[7:45] random said we had a dispensation in the
[7:48] Old Testament dispensation in the new
[7:49] dispensation of the law dispensation of
[7:51] Grace
[7:52] and that's true we believe that
[7:56] but remember he goes on to say then I'm
[7:59] not much on a dispensationalist actually
[8:01] he said he was
[8:02] well if you ask me today you'd say
[8:05] brother Dale or you're a dispensations I
[8:07] said yeah according to my understanding
[8:09] of dispensations
[8:12] but maybe according to a lot of people's
[8:14] understanding of that I would not be one
[8:16] because I believe it's the same God in
[8:19] the Old Testament
[8:21] is revealed in the New Testament
[8:24] all right see it's not two different
[8:26] gods it's the same God all right you'd
[8:30] say well now if the Old Testament
[8:32] reveals one dispensation you say well
[8:34] that's a dispensation of a father
[8:37] and you know that being one God and then
[8:40] the New Testament being a dispensation
[8:42] of the son and it being a different God
[8:44] then I'm not a dispensationalist either
[8:48] you know I believe that's the former
[8:50] idea of the point that he was saying
[8:52] when he said I'm not on that but he went
[8:54] on to say the quotes I gave you the
[8:55] three he said the Gentile dispensation
[8:58] right in the same quote Parts you know
[9:00] so my point is
[9:02] uh I believe in one true and living God
[9:07] revealed throughout the entire word of
[9:10] God
[9:12] all right now I believe that the
[9:15] revealing of God
[9:18] was not complete now take my wording and
[9:21] listen
[9:22] are finished even in Jesus Christ
[9:27] and even though he was the fullness of
[9:29] the god hid bodily
[9:30] all right and he was the son of man but
[9:34] that was not the completion of it
[9:37] all right because there is a bride to be
[9:40] revealed
[9:42] and the prophet said she's part of the
[9:45] mystery
[9:47] and must be revealed
[9:49] all right now I believe that's Christ in
[9:50] history I'll get back to those points
[9:52] later but
[9:54] see I believe that it's the same God
[9:56] being revealed all the way through and I
[9:59] believe like in the ages then that it's
[10:01] uh not him revealing himself in one age
[10:04] is something and the other age is
[10:07] something else the ages is the revealing
[10:11] of God
[10:13] to us
[10:15] of the part that was not made known back
[10:17] there in human flesh as he was walking
[10:20] the Earth he was the fullness of the
[10:22] godhead bodily yeah but we had to be in
[10:24] him
[10:25] all right so we're not something added
[10:28] that would be a dispensation like
[10:30] mankind is looking at at something here
[10:33] and something here different no we are
[10:35] not anything different we are him made
[10:38] manifest
[10:40] in a mini-membered body whereas it was
[10:42] once in one body see now we are the body
[10:46] of God upon the Earth and he's revealing
[10:50] himself
[10:51] in the way that is to be done all right
[10:54] we'll cover in a little bit that down
[10:57] through the church ages he was revealing
[10:59] himself as Son of God
[11:02] all right then in the end time he'd be
[11:05] revealing himself a son of man
[11:07] right now I want you to watch this
[11:10] real careful in a minute I'll say it and
[11:12] then repeat it because I want you to
[11:15] follow the line
[11:17] and I remember in my early years of
[11:19] studying it and we had an old
[11:22] battery-powered type player for the
[11:25] seven inch real recorder you know thing
[11:27] that we we carried to work and back and
[11:31] we'd listen to run around preaching as
[11:33] we'd go to work you know and coming back
[11:35] and
[11:36] we would
[11:37] it was a battery powered and we didn't
[11:39] always have
[11:41] hookups in the car you know so in the
[11:43] old days so we'd have to run batteries
[11:46] and I have sit there because it'd have
[11:48] enough battery to keep the voice I've
[11:50] sat there with a pencil and actually
[11:51] turned the thing
[11:54] halfway home
[11:56] because I was interested in hearing
[11:59] you know I'd turn it myself make it go
[12:01] and the rest of it you know because I
[12:04] wanted to hear and I remember we we hit
[12:07] something I've mentioned this before to
[12:09] you
[12:09] but we were probably and we'd always
[12:11] just choose you know like I choose one
[12:13] day brother moat would one day brother
[12:15] Holland one brother Lewis
[12:18] and for some reason one week whenever
[12:20] any of us chose but one type we had the
[12:23] unveiling of God
[12:25] and uh so we played that for five days
[12:29] you know it just went that way we just
[12:31] didn't bring another one well you know
[12:33] about the fourth day I really caught
[12:35] what he was saying
[12:38] and uh you know it really dawned on me
[12:41] the point that he was making and it
[12:43] cleared up the Scriptures it cleared up
[12:46] a lot of things to me as to my
[12:50] understanding of the one true and living
[12:52] God
[12:54] now we'll read this in a minute so then
[12:56] we'll go back through it but see he's
[12:57] revealed as three sons name right
[13:00] so the man Son of God Son of David
[13:04] all right
[13:06] but see if you don't see it
[13:08] in the correct order
[13:10] look what you'd be going
[13:13] and then when we would cover that son of
[13:15] man
[13:17] was Dire profit dying giving his life
[13:20] come forth Son of God in the ages then
[13:23] you'd be looking at the next thing to be
[13:25] would be son of David
[13:27] well you'd be totally out of the
[13:28] scriptures
[13:30] you know even though you're quoting
[13:33] identically because there's only three
[13:35] sons names the Son of God or son of man
[13:39] Son of God Son of David
[13:41] all right
[13:42] but you've got a little key in there
[13:44] that you got to understand
[13:47] and we'll read it in a minute but see
[13:48] then it just clicked when he said it one
[13:50] day
[13:52] it's either any son of man prophet
[13:56] God himself in human flesh come to die
[14:00] not son of man wrote Son of God come
[14:02] forward to church ages Son of God
[14:06] in the end time he comes back a son of
[14:08] man
[14:10] and then you'll go to that to Israel as
[14:13] son of David
[14:15] and see then the scriptures
[14:18] beautifully fit
[14:21] the things that he was trying to explain
[14:23] begin to unfold
[14:26] is it dead then that's where I preached
[14:28] that the bride would be there in 1969
[14:31] that the bride would be the son of man
[14:35] in the last days
[14:37] all right and uh because you think about
[14:40] it
[14:41] look how you would mess up your
[14:43] scriptures
[14:45] son of man is Prophet is we'll review
[14:47] these in a minute because I want you to
[14:48] let him say it I'm saying it and getting
[14:51] your thought in your mind
[14:52] that he was son of man and he died it
[14:54] was prophet son of man
[14:57] because you couldn't kill Son of God
[15:00] there was no way see that that the Son
[15:02] of God at Calvary had to exit out of the
[15:05] body or the spirit of God
[15:07] the very life of God had to exit out of
[15:09] the body all right then on the Pentecost
[15:12] the Holy Ghost could come back
[15:14] the and be Son of God Through the Ages
[15:16] but if you went right straight on the
[15:18] son of David how are you going to get
[15:20] there
[15:22] you can't go
[15:24] and I thought how many of us has missed
[15:26] that
[15:28] and knowing this all these years and
[15:30] tried my best to appreciate unto you you
[15:32] know
[15:33] it surely gets more interesting every
[15:35] day
[15:36] you can't go from Son of God the son of
[15:39] David
[15:42] you've got to come back to a human
[15:44] element wise
[15:47] you know you've got to come back to that
[15:50] son of man so I'm saying this if you
[15:53] miss the message you know at least what
[15:54] I'm trying to say
[15:56] it's got to be then that Luke 17 30
[15:59] would come into line and and it would be
[16:01] falling into place and see then once he
[16:04] comes in fully into bride and son of man
[16:07] you can go right onto Israel
[16:11] but you know what he'll start off to
[16:13] Israel
[16:14] Son of God
[16:17] New Birth
[16:18] all right what you want to call it for
[16:19] them not in the Kingdom but
[16:22] eternal life
[16:23] you don't have to die again to give it
[16:25] to him
[16:26] but he'll give them the Holy Ghost
[16:28] then they'll see through those two
[16:30] Prophets The Son of Man
[16:35] and then they will see and realize that
[16:39] he is now son of David to them
[16:41] all right we'll read a quote here in
[16:43] just a minute where brother Ryan said
[16:44] he's the son of David to us now
[16:51] I love him little things it's laid in
[16:53] there
[16:54] and then it makes me Ponder
[16:57] consider what is being said you know
[17:02] because you see
[17:03] he's revealed to you and I as son of man
[17:07] Son of God and Son of David
[17:09] he reveals himself to his bride while
[17:12] she's here living all the manifestations
[17:15] that he'll ever be to anyone he's made
[17:19] known to her
[17:22] so he's the son of David
[17:24] in my Revelation but yet he's the son of
[17:26] man yet he's the son of God because it's
[17:29] the same God
[17:31] and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:34] all right so if you missed the message
[17:35] now
[17:36] you'll know that's what I'm talking
[17:38] about so we'll let him let him do the
[17:40] reading all right now watch as we go
[17:43] through it
[17:45] and watch this the point that we were
[17:46] talking about dispensations
[17:48] because then he's going to be the
[17:50] dispensation of the son of man
[17:53] and we'll let the prophet read it to you
[17:56] that where he says he couldn't be the
[17:58] son of God
[18:03] now that don't mean he's not Son of God
[18:07] he was born son of God right
[18:10] right and there's a quote in there with
[18:12] a prophet you know because he just time
[18:14] after time he says
[18:16] that he never revealed himself his son
[18:19] of God he said he never called himself
[18:21] Son of God he never referred to himself
[18:23] as Son of God
[18:26] that he referred to himself the son of
[18:28] man
[18:29] all right
[18:30] but see he was born
[18:33] the son of God
[18:36] because that's God
[18:38] in human flesh
[18:40] and he growed in Grace and knowledge
[18:44] because
[18:46] he was born to Emmanuel
[18:50] but then
[18:52] he never mentioned son of man
[18:56] until he enters his ministry
[19:01] then he begins to talk about son of man
[19:05] and isn't it odd how that I've always
[19:07] said to you that none of the scholars
[19:09] called it
[19:10] schofield's got some good points about
[19:12] it
[19:16] even Paul Peter didn't write about son
[19:19] of man
[19:22] but then when brother starts out in his
[19:24] ministry
[19:26] just immediately when he enters his
[19:29] ministry as to preaching
[19:31] start talking about the son of man
[19:33] that's no coincidence to me
[19:36] that's exactly what it's supposed to be
[19:38] all right now
[19:40] we've quoted this many times to you
[19:43] the prophet of God said when the bride
[19:45] realizes who she is
[19:49] and what she's here for
[19:52] he said Satan will be powerless
[19:55] before
[19:58] you think Satan could handle or could
[20:01] now let me quote it and get it straight
[20:03] what brought around said none of us is a
[20:04] match for the devil no no no Luther
[20:07] wasn't a match for the devil no way
[20:10] but yet when God revealed that just
[20:13] shall live by faith Satan with no match
[20:15] for that message
[20:18] that came forth in Martin Luther
[20:21] they said Martin Luther don't you know
[20:22] the world is against you he said I want
[20:24] them to know that I'm against them
[20:29] see nothing could tackle that message
[20:32] they could pick on the man
[20:35] and look what they're doing now nobody
[20:37] can tackle this message or the hour that
[20:40] has been given unto us
[20:42] but look what even inward
[20:45] ranks are coming forth and now they
[20:48] would not have dire said a word while he
[20:50] was alive
[20:51] but now they're running forth with their
[20:54] own messages
[20:56] well you know what I believe they're
[20:57] doing they're running without a message
[21:00] because they run out of this message
[21:03] into their own all right
[21:06] but think about it now and just watch
[21:07] the point
[21:09] and remember when we read it that he
[21:12] never referred to himself as son of man
[21:14] because that was not his office at the
[21:17] time
[21:18] that was not his dispensational
[21:22] of revealing himself
[21:24] the
[21:26] in any even goes to Peter you know who
[21:29] the man say I the son of man am
[21:33] Peter said
[21:35] darn the Christ
[21:38] the son of the Living God he never said
[21:40] Peter now hold it hold on hold it I'm
[21:41] not the Son of God now let me tell you
[21:43] I'm gonna straighten you out you know
[21:44] no
[21:46] because he knew
[21:48] that's all they can handle
[21:50] so he said Peter
[21:52] you didn't answer my question
[21:55] because you don't understand son of man
[21:59] I said you've got the right point that
[22:02] I'm the son of God
[22:04] and upon that Revelation I'll be over my
[22:07] church
[22:10] on the revelation of Son of God
[22:14] I said in the end time I'm going to come
[22:16] back
[22:18] in the day when the son of man is to be
[22:20] revealed
[22:21] you know all right
[22:24] think on these things
[22:26] see then that way
[22:28] I'm not a dispensationalist to believe
[22:31] in changing of gods or changing of
[22:35] that I believe every Church aged there
[22:37] was God made manifest for the age they
[22:39] were in
[22:40] all right but I believe he puts it all
[22:43] in the end
[22:44] and not giving us anything any different
[22:48] because I believe what Luther talked
[22:51] I believe what Wesley taught
[22:53] I believe the truth of what they talk I
[22:56] believe what the Baptist taught the
[22:57] Presbyterian talk the Pentecostals talk
[23:00] I believe the truth of it
[23:02] God is part of God's word
[23:07] see that way I'm not rejecting anything
[23:11] I'm not an isolationist or what you'd
[23:13] call it you just don't want your brain
[23:15] about
[23:16] no
[23:18] anything I guess we're lulaites
[23:21] we just that's what I believe
[23:24] that we're trying to be what God wants
[23:27] us to be for the hour we're in okay now
[23:30] watch as he begins to as it begins to
[23:33] unfold and and you'll see the pattern
[23:36] coming down
[23:38] in the dispensations will fall into
[23:40] place are the times or the revealing
[23:44] will fall into place to where we can see
[23:46] it so go ahead brother
[23:48] Joe I guess
[23:50] I mean who's my car Dave Bob and Joe I
[23:53] guess the other day I was looking around
[23:57] I said they must have this thing on
[23:58] automatic
[24:01] all right look what he says I wish you
[24:04] would listen to the unveiling of God
[24:08] the Mighty God unveiled
[24:11] especially those two messages
[24:15] and study them
[24:17] and then like I said you'll see there's
[24:20] words in there that'll
[24:22] if you'll really study what he's saying
[24:25] and then when you do you'll see
[24:26] something and it'll just open up the
[24:28] beautiful picture of the Plan of
[24:31] Redemption from God all right now watch
[24:33] he came in three names
[24:35] three sons name
[24:37] he came into son name of the son of man
[24:40] the son of David
[24:43] and the Son of God now he didn't put
[24:45] them in order
[24:48] but yet we know the order because he
[24:50] puts you know the message did he put
[24:52] them in order then he explains it now
[24:55] now he came first in the son of he
[24:57] started to say David and or whatever
[24:59] because they put the point there
[25:01] he said Son of Man so he came first the
[25:04] son of man because he was a prophet
[25:08] now Jehovah himself called Ezekiel and
[25:11] the prophets son of man what's this thou
[25:13] you know son of man
[25:16] Jesus never referred to himself as Son
[25:18] of God
[25:20] he referred to himself as son of man
[25:23] because the scriptures cannot be broken
[25:25] right now look how specific
[25:29] the prophet with no education
[25:32] could talk
[25:34] it baffles me
[25:36] because maybe you don't follow it the
[25:38] way I do you know
[25:39] maybe that's good that you don't but
[25:42] look he never referred to himself as Son
[25:44] of God he never referred to himself as
[25:47] Son of God
[25:51] he didn't say they didn't write that he
[25:53] was the son of God
[25:57] look at Perfect
[25:58] maybe you don't follow scripture like
[26:00] that I mean those things mean great to
[26:02] me
[26:03] the Bible could call him the Son of God
[26:05] when he was born
[26:08] the Bible can put him into lineage and
[26:11] call him a son of God
[26:13] right
[26:14] well he says he
[26:19] Jesus never referred to himself as Son
[26:22] of God
[26:24] how perfect is it being it is
[26:27] he referred to himself as son of man
[26:30] because the scriptures cannot be broken
[26:32] I like going to the next that was
[26:34] paragraph 60.
[26:37] this is progress 68 same message the
[26:40] unveiling of God notice he came first as
[26:43] the prophet
[26:45] and they crucified him
[26:47] his own crucified him he came as the son
[26:50] of man
[26:51] then after the Holy Spirit came he was
[26:54] then the son of God
[26:56] is the spirit
[26:58] he was the Holy Spirit Son of God he
[27:01] lived through the church ages as Son of
[27:03] God watch him
[27:05] now in the Millennium it'd be son of
[27:08] David sitting on the throne of his
[27:09] father David
[27:11] he is the son of David now
[27:16] he is to you and I
[27:18] and he is the son of David he just
[27:20] wasn't making himself manifest to him he
[27:24] was the son of David
[27:25] but
[27:27] you know he didn't change God's he was
[27:29] the same God as what I tried with all
[27:30] this about dispensation that gets you to
[27:33] look at it very Stewart Son of God Son
[27:35] of Man son of David standing on Earth
[27:39] but he was not making himself known in
[27:42] that way
[27:44] he was making himself known as son of
[27:46] man
[27:47] because you can't kill God which would
[27:50] be the Son of God and he certainly can't
[27:52] kill the son of David
[27:54] me
[27:56] so he had to come as a human man
[28:01] to release that life that was within him
[28:04] that's why it's called son of man see
[28:07] watch it
[28:08] but look at the point
[28:10] he says what caught me they were
[28:12] listening see he's the son of David
[28:14] sitting upon the throne of his father
[28:16] and remember between the son of God
[28:20] and he just kind of stops
[28:24] in the lady you'll see an age
[28:27] they put him out who
[28:32] and be real careful with me
[28:37] they rejected this message
[28:40] and let you see her
[28:43] and they put brother random out
[28:45] because he started out preaching the 400
[28:47] 000 wasn't preaching the 30.
[28:51] you know 30 people or something or less
[28:54] and see they turned him out
[28:57] and just like it was to Samuel when God
[29:01] said they haven't rejected you Samuel
[29:03] they've rejected me they wanted Samuel
[29:09] in their organizational systems of this
[29:11] world wanted the great prophet of this
[29:15] day to come and have healing campaigns
[29:20] one thing was to draw money for their
[29:22] own benefit but yet it was to benefit
[29:25] the people of healings and great things
[29:28] but when he began to preach
[29:32] right
[29:33] what did he say when you begin to say
[29:35] I'm my father one
[29:37] all right so then look at what it's
[29:39] doing now I want to I want to be slow if
[29:42] I have to real slow
[29:44] I want you to get this
[29:46] I've got notes written now that would
[29:48] take if I appreciate four more sermons
[29:51] and I've never been that far ahead
[29:54] I hadn't I've never been that far ahead
[29:57] in 40 something years of preaching
[30:01] remember the son of David and the ladies
[30:03] in church a son of God's gift
[30:07] they put him out
[30:09] he said we'll put it down they didn't
[30:11] put out the Holy Spirit
[30:14] not like not wanting it
[30:17] they wanted to be there to the great
[30:19] signs and wonders
[30:22] but they don't want the word
[30:25] that is related to this Holy Spirit
[30:29] so you see what they're putting out
[30:31] you return down the word you
[30:33] automatically turn down the spirit and
[30:34] you can holler and scream all you want
[30:36] to I got the Holy Ghost
[30:39] right
[30:41] and you dress and act and do like the
[30:43] world
[30:44] now don't tell me too late
[30:48] huh
[30:50] it's even that way you can say I love
[30:52] the word
[30:55] it's only up to a certain degree
[30:58] right
[30:59] so father what we're going through
[31:03] and then Luke watch look at the point
[31:06] they put him out
[31:09] they put the Holy Spirit out of the
[31:10] church you remember Wade Wednesday night
[31:12] and what he was bringing
[31:14] from what brother Brown said that the
[31:17] Holy Ghost has been bound for 2000 years
[31:20] at the door of Creeds and dogmas
[31:24] but to be loosed in the end time by
[31:28] thank you
[31:29] the last Angel's message
[31:32] right
[31:34] so the Holy Ghost even in the Great Book
[31:36] of Acts
[31:38] you look right over it and there it was
[31:40] right in the church beginning to Fall
[31:41] Away
[31:44] see then the Holy Ghost never really
[31:45] been loosed
[31:47] for 2000 years that's me back before
[31:49] count that's back before it came
[31:53] right
[31:55] you get the point the Holy Ghost is
[31:58] never worked the way he wanted to work
[32:04] but is to do that in the end time
[32:07] but look
[32:09] the latest teenage they put him out
[32:12] now Son of God
[32:16] so looked like he should have been
[32:18] saying and next he revealed himself as
[32:20] son of David
[32:22] that's supposed to be the next in line
[32:24] isn't it
[32:27] so the man Son of God Son of David
[32:31] one two three
[32:33] well look son of man Son of God
[32:37] son of man
[32:39] so David
[32:41] and just in case some of you out there
[32:44] are so smart that you think four is an
[32:47] antichrist number I happen to know that
[32:49] is
[32:51] white black red and pale but I happen to
[32:55] know that four is a restoration number
[32:58] right justification sanctification
[33:00] baptismal ghost and then the word
[33:04] right
[33:06] so then we think we're so well I just
[33:08] cut him off he don't even understand
[33:09] four
[33:13] you got to pulpit
[33:16] all I want is to ask you a question
[33:19] how can you go from Son of God to son of
[33:22] David
[33:27] to go to son of David you've got to come
[33:29] back to earth and something
[33:31] right so watch him
[33:33] and in Luke now he's put out of the lady
[33:35] of cnh Son of God
[33:38] and in Luke he said he'll be revealed as
[33:41] son of this as son of man the prophet
[33:46] come on
[33:47] fulfilling the rest of it
[33:50] see the scriptures ties perfectly
[33:52] together son of man Son of God Son of
[33:55] David
[33:59] the mystery is hidden right there in a
[34:01] few words
[34:03] it needs to come back from Son of God to
[34:06] the ages and the end time is to come as
[34:08] the son of man a great mystery
[34:12] but yet everybody knows all about the
[34:14] prophet came
[34:16] amen
[34:18] thank God
[34:22] but remember
[34:24] the prophet is just like Luther
[34:28] Luther preached the message of the just
[34:30] shall live by faith but the Catholic
[34:32] Church never got scared of him
[34:35] it was when the people began to believe
[34:38] the message Satan's wouldn't have scared
[34:40] of brother random he couldn't tackle him
[34:42] he knew better to try it
[34:46] but yet when he passed off look what
[34:48] he'd done they've attacked this message
[34:50] from every form of could be thought of
[34:59] it but look
[35:01] the scriptures tie perfectly together
[35:03] son of man Son of God Son of David what
[35:05] was it it's the same God all the time
[35:08] just changing his form in morphe right
[35:13] he's just changing here it's a great
[35:15] drama to him he is acting it out
[35:22] displaying himself as son of man
[35:25] the prophet God to come and die
[35:32] right can't kill Son of God can't kill
[35:35] son of David right
[35:37] son of man right had to come
[35:41] but then he comes down to the ages of
[35:43] Son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[35:47] but in the end time he's being revealed
[35:49] as son of man
[35:52] then he can go to Israel the son of
[35:54] David
[35:55] to me that's marvelous I saw it then and
[35:58] I rejoiced and you know
[36:01] I've cried and done everything in the
[36:03] book try to get people to see that
[36:05] well I just don't know don't get
[36:09] confused
[36:10] don't worry honey you already are
[36:14] he was born and I was born confused
[36:18] it's going to take the Holy Ghost to
[36:20] straighten this out
[36:21] and just because that he went from
[36:24] because now I'm going to show you
[36:26] something that's going to you're going
[36:27] to think I'm against brother random
[36:29] we're going to give you a quote after
[36:30] while I or this maybe not this evening
[36:34] where he said he died son of man and
[36:37] Rose Son of God
[36:46] I I thought the son of man raised
[36:52] I taught the son of man
[36:54] flesh
[36:56] was one that appeared to Mary
[37:00] I didn't know it was just some theophany
[37:02] form of Son of God
[37:06] it's the way he's explaining how it's
[37:08] going to change dispensations
[37:12] it's going to change the way he's
[37:14] revealing himself
[37:16] because as I said when he said who the
[37:18] man said I was on a map they didn't get
[37:20] it
[37:21] we said all right I gotta bring the
[37:23] church ages
[37:25] but what's going to be amazing is when
[37:26] we get about two more sermons over
[37:28] and we'll come back into what we've
[37:30] preached all 40 something years he
[37:32] stands in the midst of the seven gold
[37:34] and candlesticks one like
[37:36] unto the son of man
[37:42] because she's going to give birth to him
[37:44] whether we believe it or not
[37:46] whether we want to be a part of it or
[37:48] not
[37:50] that's our choice
[37:52] all right
[37:53] what is it same God all the time
[37:57] just changing his form
[38:01] well who is the life form of God in the
[38:03] Gentile dispensation
[38:08] of course the way most people believe it
[38:09] it was right around them
[38:11] brother random was a part of the body of
[38:13] Christ because he was a born-again
[38:14] Christian
[38:15] that's right
[38:18] but he was not to complete a morphe of
[38:20] God or the form of God we've been
[38:21] through all that we've preached it over
[38:23] over
[38:25] but follow it now
[38:27] remember between the son of God
[38:31] and remember between the son of God
[38:37] where would his thought be going
[38:40] when he would be going between the Son
[38:42] of God and what
[38:44] Son of God and Son of David
[38:46] he's going to come back as son of man
[38:50] does everybody what do you believe what
[38:52] I'm saying or not do you understand
[38:55] I can't reveal that and I can't make you
[38:58] see it right but do you understand what
[39:02] I'm saying
[39:04] well we don't believe you we believe
[39:06] brother Brandon well I just read what he
[39:09] said
[39:11] no you argue with him
[39:16] well what about it
[39:18] look how he keeps referring and like I
[39:21] said isn't it odd
[39:22] because these all these quotes and
[39:24] things I deliberately brought in things
[39:27] about the the end time prophet of
[39:29] Malachi 4.
[39:31] is to keep our thoughts in the line
[39:35] the son of man would not be in The Bride
[39:38] of Jesus Christ in the end time unless
[39:42] God fulfilled his word
[39:45] to bring Malachi 4 into being
[39:50] in Luke 17 30 and Revelations 10 7.
[39:56] let's go or I don't need no Prophet I'll
[39:59] just be what I'm supposed to be I'm
[40:01] going to be God made manifest now you're
[40:04] the devil
[40:06] that's as plain as I can put it because
[40:09] you got it in the wrong line
[40:12] if it ain't lined up straight we're not
[40:14] going to come out to the right thing
[40:18] and even if it's lined up perfect until
[40:21] it's revealed
[40:24] he does us no good
[40:27] that's right well it's been revealed to
[40:28] me because I read it that don't make a
[40:30] revelation
[40:32] you read the Bible before you heard the
[40:34] prophet
[40:36] why wasn't it it was revealed to you
[40:41] well because God has to reveal it
[40:44] okay
[40:46] let's go on now and get to thought look
[40:49] at the next one number seven
[40:51] God's provided place of worship
[40:54] 65 425 paragraph 192.
[40:58] tell them about to come into the Lord
[41:00] Jesus for the Holy Ghost and the living
[41:01] presence of the Living God Jesus said in
[41:04] Saint Mark here he said in that day the
[41:07] son of man will be revealed that's in
[41:09] Luke and brings it out in Mark also
[41:12] now remember not Son of God he came in
[41:15] three sons names
[41:16] son of man Son of God Son of David
[41:20] when he was on Earth
[41:21] he come as the son of man
[41:24] he was a prophet
[41:27] now Sid is it coincidental
[41:31] that there had to be a prophet
[41:35] you know a man on Earth
[41:38] to bring the message in the end time
[41:41] if that don't give the honor and glory
[41:43] to the position that brother Branham
[41:46] held in I don't understand you and your
[41:48] thinking
[41:49] go that puts the whole dependence upon
[41:52] whether or not God sent the man
[41:56] there's been a lot of good men and good
[41:58] thoughts and good preaching and things
[42:03] but see we're putting all I or I am at
[42:05] least I have everything I've got I don't
[42:08] have no extra basket you know in
[42:10] financial matters you don't put all of
[42:12] your eggs in the same basket well I
[42:15] don't have many eggs so it don't matter
[42:17] how many baskets
[42:19] I could put them in four baskets and
[42:21] wouldn't have to worry about too many in
[42:23] the baskets all right
[42:26] but in religious matters
[42:31] that's what I tried to say this morning
[42:34] if you're talking about a dispensation
[42:36] that reveals a different God from one
[42:38] time to the other then that's then
[42:40] that's the doctrine of dense
[42:42] sensationalist
[42:44] theology
[42:47] that goes into the unified part
[42:50] of mankind trying to bring it out
[42:53] but to see the same God revealed
[42:57] in many forms
[43:00] for yet the same God
[43:02] that's wonderful to me I mean but look
[43:05] he came in three sons and I saw the man
[43:07] Son of God Son of David when he was on
[43:09] Earth he comes son of man he was a
[43:11] prophet so the man is a prophet Jehovah
[43:13] himself called the prophets Jeremiah and
[43:15] them son of man what's his style Jesus
[43:18] come because he had to come according to
[43:22] the scriptures
[43:25] he had to come ask the son of man
[43:29] Moses said
[43:31] the Lord your God shall raise up a
[43:33] prophet
[43:33] like an unto me
[43:36] now he was referring to his own self
[43:38] wouldn't he because he referred to the
[43:40] prophetic side
[43:41] and he had to be a prophet son of man
[43:44] but after his death burial and
[43:46] Resurrection now he has been Son of God
[43:49] the supernatural the Holy Spirit
[43:53] so that's what come back on the death
[43:54] Pentecost
[43:57] because that son of man died
[44:00] to release that Holy Ghost and after his
[44:03] Ascension and the things that happened
[44:04] to that human element of his
[44:07] and I believe he raised in an eternal
[44:09] body
[44:11] so then you you're losing your son of
[44:13] man contact point
[44:16] I was just trying to bring out an
[44:18] illustration a moment ago
[44:20] that the prophet is right
[44:22] when he died son of man then he rose Son
[44:25] of God on the dead Pentecost the Holy
[44:27] Ghost came to prove it
[44:29] so it's going to be Son of God down
[44:31] through seven Church ages right
[44:34] all right
[44:36] and look what he goes on to say
[44:40] it's the great Holy Spirit this is the
[44:42] unveiling of God paragraph 65.
[44:45] now notice now as he came he had to come
[44:48] as son of man because the holy spirit
[44:50] said that he would
[44:52] God would raise up a prophet to them so
[44:54] he could not come calling himself the
[44:56] Son of God because it wasn't that
[44:59] dispensation
[45:02] you got it
[45:04] I need to walk back
[45:08] down
[45:10] we got him
[45:13] we got it we got it okay
[45:17] he could not come calling himself the
[45:19] Son of God because it wasn't that
[45:22] dispensation
[45:24] all right
[45:25] he was the son of man prophesying to
[45:28] fulfill and reveal to them all the
[45:31] things that had been done and taught
[45:33] what he was then he was on the earth as
[45:36] son of man and I say
[45:39] Luke 17 30 says he'll return us son of
[45:42] man
[45:43] it's no coincidence
[45:47] that God would send a prophet
[45:50] in this age in time
[45:54] right
[45:55] promised in the word
[45:58] now these are familiar statements but
[46:00] let's just get at least one out of it
[46:04] go ahead with number nine
[46:08] and think about what he's saying
[46:12] now we're in a changing dispensation
[46:19] and ever change just like building a
[46:21] building
[46:22] you come to the corner
[46:24] you have to make that bend
[46:26] it's strange everybody wants to run a
[46:28] straight line on down
[46:30] you'd have just one big wall
[46:33] but we're building a building
[46:35] and we've come to the corners
[46:38] and you've got to change
[46:41] those Corners that's Brother Don price
[46:43] so well he
[46:46] and so well stated it not long ago at
[46:49] those changes is where the Trouble Comes
[46:53] where the it's hard on that corner to
[46:57] make cut that corner and make it just
[46:59] right
[47:04] simple illustration
[47:06] we built a house in 1965.
[47:09] we had the you call them batter box
[47:11] boards or what is it called batter
[47:12] boards that you put out and you square
[47:15] everything up
[47:16] and you you get it you run your strings
[47:18] you know and you you get that right and
[47:22] you start out and
[47:23] and it don't matter
[47:25] what this building you can take that
[47:27] corner to that corner
[47:28] and it's the same thing as that corner
[47:31] to that corner is square
[47:34] right
[47:36] it's Square
[47:37] if you ever want to do anything and you
[47:39] want to get his choir just measure from
[47:41] you know this is not Square so we'll cut
[47:43] it down a little
[47:44] these measure this corner make sure it's
[47:46] same back on you guys squared you can
[47:48] fool around all you want to you grind
[47:51] parade doing what you want to trying to
[47:52] Market just do that and it'll simply be
[47:54] square
[47:57] we had to do things a little different
[47:59] in our day
[48:00] the easiest way to level a house
[48:04] a room
[48:06] they got it new today because they got a
[48:08] water hose
[48:10] a water glass is the most simple thing
[48:13] if you wanted to see if this Pulpit was
[48:16] level
[48:17] set a water glass
[48:19] fill it to the brim
[48:22] if it's off
[48:25] right it won't be right
[48:28] so what's he saying
[48:31] he said we're in a change in a
[48:33] dispensation
[48:35] all right
[48:37] he said everybody wants to down the wall
[48:39] That's Pentecost and different ones
[48:42] because it's easy if you can get one
[48:44] string to the other one to just keep
[48:45] things going we underpin the house one
[48:48] time and
[48:49] old house we lived in and already had
[48:52] some kind of pillars in it and we were
[48:53] doing them well I came in one day and my
[48:56] little wife
[48:57] she had laid about uh
[49:00] 10 not 6 by 10
[49:04] sex in the blocks
[49:07] and it was good
[49:11] the only problem she had
[49:13] she laid according to the Contour of the
[49:16] land
[49:20] because she didn't know you go over step
[49:22] down step down she she just let him go
[49:24] into well she done it and she just took
[49:28] pieces of concrete and just put it in
[49:30] the top
[49:32] it was perfect we were going to stucco
[49:34] it anyway so what did it matter
[49:36] all right
[49:37] what you see anybody can lay a straight
[49:39] line
[49:41] if you got a strain to go with it's easy
[49:43] you just get some rain
[49:46] but when you come to a corner
[49:48] as I saying about that house we booked
[49:50] the the batter boxes or what you call
[49:53] them put them up well one day this cow
[49:56] decided she wanted to go through where
[49:58] the building was going to be
[50:00] so she tore down the corner
[50:04] well I asked the man I said what in the
[50:05] world am I going to do he said we'll try
[50:06] to square it like we do corner to corner
[50:08] and do the best you can so we drove back
[50:10] to Stakes we put them up
[50:12] well it looked pretty good
[50:15] and they laid the blocks according to
[50:18] the strain I put back
[50:20] but when we got ready to put down the
[50:23] floor joists
[50:24] we come to find it out that it wasn't
[50:26] exactly Square
[50:29] you know how you do it with floor joists
[50:31] if you want to make sure they're Square
[50:32] just take your four by eight she do
[50:34] plywood and nail it down on one corner
[50:35] it's going to square it
[50:37] so when they got over that corner to
[50:39] come find out it was sticking over about
[50:41] two inches
[50:43] then we had to do a little scabbing on
[50:45] you know but my point is
[50:47] I wouldn't a carpenter
[50:51] but
[50:52] a real man that can make today that take
[50:55] that corner a real Carpenter can start
[50:57] right here on this corner
[50:58] and you can wear yourself to death he
[51:01] can go to another corner and start
[51:04] if he really knows what he's doing
[51:06] brother random knew what he was doing
[51:09] that's what he said
[51:11] he come to change the corner
[51:14] right
[51:16] God sent us a prophet to change the
[51:18] corner but what did he say we're doing
[51:20] we're not building a bill uh
[51:23] blind a wall
[51:26] he said we're building a building
[51:29] what
[51:31] it had to be that last Corner turned
[51:34] to make this building come out right
[51:40] and let's say that a real Carpenter he
[51:43] doesn't have to have all of the modern
[51:45] things
[51:47] of line strong for the Gary he can tell
[51:51] you
[51:53] you get three corners you can get the
[51:54] other Corner if you know what you're
[51:56] doing
[52:00] might be all for half an inch quarter
[52:02] inch on a big house which not much we
[52:05] got a problem for that I'm going to
[52:07] solve her we was doing something up at
[52:09] terrence's one day he looked at it and
[52:11] he said
[52:13] daddy that ain't Right Said
[52:16] that corner is off so there's a gap
[52:18] there
[52:20] I said we're just going to fill that up
[52:21] we're caulking he said but Daddy they
[52:24] don't make three-quarter inch caulking
[52:28] all right
[52:29] check everybody a little bit
[52:32] but we're changing he said changing
[52:35] dispensation another known down below
[52:36] there we're talking about changing
[52:38] dispensation
[52:40] see when he come into the when this
[52:42] Prophet came into being in the last days
[52:44] he knew that he wasn't just laying a
[52:47] straight line
[52:48] but you know what he had to do
[52:50] now he says me okay
[52:54] when Azusa Street came in see Luther
[52:56] Wesley Pentecost
[52:59] when Azusa Street came in
[53:01] they had the lines going straight
[53:03] supposed to be in the start with
[53:05] all right
[53:06] it was up to him to find that corner so
[53:09] what did Brother random do
[53:11] remember he had to back up to the
[53:14] Pentecostals and relay every bit of that
[53:18] have you heard him enough I want to say
[53:19] that you know
[53:23] his message didn't begin until 1963.
[53:27] but in the years of preparation he said
[53:30] and I will restore the years of the
[53:32] cankerworm five more Locust the
[53:34] caterpillar so he had to back up to that
[53:36] line of Zeus's Street and know that was
[53:39] exactly right and shoot that line and
[53:41] get that line straight
[53:44] and rebuild the wall
[53:48] but then he had to make a corner
[53:50] to make that finalize change or
[53:54] dispensation to turn that corner to hit
[53:57] it back to hit back with Luther
[54:02] it had to be a prophet
[54:05] so then God would be promised in Malachi
[54:08] 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7.
[54:11] to send us a prophet
[54:15] to be able to take that word and turn
[54:16] that corner and square back up to be
[54:19] able to hit exactly on that other one
[54:22] today folks
[54:25] you draw a line at 100 100 feet draw to
[54:29] 50 feet
[54:31] and if you don't get it exactly squared
[54:34] you can be an inch off in a hurry you
[54:38] remember the prophet
[54:39] you shoot the gun
[54:41] what about it
[54:43] you shoot a gun he said you're off a
[54:46] higher here
[54:48] right you just twitch the barrel you let
[54:52] somebody touch the barrel move it or
[54:54] something Danny's shaking his head these
[54:55] shooters know what I'm talking about
[54:58] 100 yards you're way off
[55:01] right see he couldn't afford that
[55:03] God knew what he's doing so he went back
[55:06] and let that man relay
[55:09] all of that building he laid Luther in
[55:11] Foundation he laid Wesley he laid the
[55:14] Pentecost brought it all back to
[55:15] Restoration
[55:20] and then he made the corner
[55:24] now but when he made the corner
[55:29] I thought now I'm just honest and just
[55:32] always believed this
[55:36] I believe what the Bible says
[55:40] that the apostles prophets pastors
[55:42] evangelists teachers is for the
[55:45] perfecting of the Saints
[55:50] and once brother Branham got to Corner
[55:52] laid and turned with his message
[55:56] now you and I can go straight down that
[55:57] line
[55:59] as long as we stay with this message
[56:02] but remember we're trying to hit where
[56:03] Luther left off
[56:06] we're lining up
[56:09] the right way
[56:12] they say Tony
[56:15] and I believe he's the best tall layer
[56:17] in the country
[56:20] but if he don't like what it looks like
[56:23] and it ain't exactly right
[56:26] and you'll take it up and do it again
[56:29] that's a good tile layer
[56:32] you say well it's just a sixteenth of an
[56:35] inch
[56:37] I'm laying some at Richards the other
[56:39] day and I told him I said he said that
[56:41] sure is funny looking over one corner I
[56:43] said yeah but it had been a whole lot
[56:45] more fun here if I hadn't leaned it
[56:48] see instead of putting it down Squire
[56:50] and being over the wall
[56:51] and all that being perfect I turned it
[56:56] made this wall straight and that wall
[56:58] come off about that far and if that and
[57:01] this wall over here would look like that
[57:02] on one end and that way on the other end
[57:05] you ever hung vinyl
[57:07] you don't hang vinyl
[57:09] from the bottom
[57:12] you measure from the top down
[57:17] right and if you've got to put anything
[57:18] out of line put it out of line on the
[57:20] bottom
[57:21] and then lay it all
[57:23] and you come up to the top and you got
[57:25] 14 feet or 20 feet or 100 feet you want
[57:28] it to look right because you sure don't
[57:30] want it to look like that on one end and
[57:31] that on the other one
[57:34] it shows up you don't know what you're
[57:36] doing so when you get out of level down
[57:37] who's going to look at the bottom and
[57:39] say oh that ain't level
[57:41] no
[57:46] let me see real random put it right
[57:49] this message is right
[57:51] amen he laid that corner perfectly
[57:55] his message is laid that corner
[57:57] he said we're not building a wall
[58:00] we're building a building
[58:02] well I thought the building that we were
[58:04] supposed to be building is the body of
[58:07] Jesus Christ into the statue of a
[58:09] perfect man
[58:13] and I believe the five full ministry
[58:16] you see them now my Lord
[58:20] they come one time when God did and he
[58:21] said I want you to come to help me
[58:24] well you won't know and I know you can
[58:26] lay blocked I've seen you
[58:28] said we're building chicken houses
[58:30] 300 foot long
[58:33] if you can do it
[58:35] I said yeah
[58:37] but I said you went on to work my way
[58:40] he said what I said if it don't look
[58:42] right I'll tear it down start again I'm
[58:44] Tony with that
[58:46] he wouldn't like it for three days later
[58:47] I'm still tearing the wall down putting
[58:49] it back
[58:51] because I wanted to be right
[58:53] see this message is Right folks
[58:57] the prophet came and turned that corner
[59:00] he gave us all the dimensions all of the
[59:03] things
[59:06] and told us
[59:08] look at Dental Wade's house remodeling
[59:10] it and we had a guy with a transit to
[59:13] shoot it
[59:15] you know
[59:17] perfectly in line perfectly level
[59:22] we laid afford to
[59:25] Foundation Alex saw that out
[59:27] we started laying two or three blind I
[59:29] said this thing ain't right
[59:32] I said well he shot it with a Transit I
[59:35] know I helped him I drove the stage and
[59:38] I marked the mark and put the
[59:40] state right
[59:43] he said what do you mean
[59:46] I said it's out about two inches
[59:50] and we can't afford that go to the house
[59:52] it's gonna be sitting off the corner
[59:56] you see that's how people are sometimes
[59:58] made for jobs of doing things
[1:00:02] whether Gary does a marvelous job of
[1:00:06] building that's right it's good to build
[1:00:09] behind him you know
[1:00:10] it's good to work on something he's
[1:00:12] worked on because you can depend on it
[1:00:14] being squire
[1:00:16] things will be right
[1:00:18] well see that's what we are in the
[1:00:19] five-fold ministry the five-fold
[1:00:21] ministry is to Build That Wall after the
[1:00:24] prophet turned the corner
[1:00:26] now what do we build it with he gave us
[1:00:28] all the material he gave us everything
[1:00:31] I don't have to worry about laying
[1:00:32] blocks
[1:00:34] I just line up
[1:00:37] with a message
[1:00:39] man
[1:00:40] and look down through there
[1:00:42] you get into machinist work
[1:00:44] then you have your machinists in here
[1:00:46] with a Donnie I know he's worked kind of
[1:00:48] around that but you know there's people
[1:00:49] that can see five thousands of an inch
[1:00:52] in machinist work
[1:00:53] that's how good the eyeball is
[1:00:55] five thousands that's a good chewing gum
[1:00:58] paper
[1:01:02] they ain't even that thick
[1:01:05] hey we're that particular
[1:01:09] why wouldn't we be particular
[1:01:12] he doesn't know what Paul says
[1:01:16] be careful how you build upon the
[1:01:20] foundation is that scripture
[1:01:24] you get it lined up straight
[1:01:26] we've got the string strung from one
[1:01:28] corner to the other one we just keep
[1:01:30] laying it right on Down the Line
[1:01:33] four 40 years later we're still laying
[1:01:38] somebody's going to complete this
[1:01:39] building
[1:01:41] it's going to be finished because we're
[1:01:43] changing dispensation
[1:01:45] it is on a wall
[1:01:47] it's a building
[1:01:49] he builds a house
[1:01:53] and there's many cuts and turns
[1:01:56] that he's predicted here in the Bible
[1:02:02] why don't we believe it what are those
[1:02:06] turns and cuts let's deal with it just a
[1:02:09] little amen we're going to have another
[1:02:11] sermon out of this one
[1:02:14] look at number 11 number and we're
[1:02:17] kicked off ten we're gonna number 11 64
[1:02:21] 427 of Mercy is called a trial in Tucson
[1:02:23] Arizona to paragraph 235.
[1:02:26] now Jesus never said in the days when
[1:02:28] the Son of God will be revealed
[1:02:30] he was revealed in the church age
[1:02:34] I read it
[1:02:36] he was revealed in the church age
[1:02:41] Son of God
[1:02:43] but the church hath put him out
[1:02:46] that's what they put out they put out
[1:02:47] the son of God
[1:02:51] they didn't want it
[1:02:52] not when it began to be lined up when
[1:02:55] that Prophet began to get them corners
[1:02:57] and bringing it down
[1:03:01] they didn't like it
[1:03:04] too straight
[1:03:07] too straight to talk to women about
[1:03:09] cutting their hair painting the face
[1:03:11] wearing pants different things men long
[1:03:14] hair too straight
[1:03:16] I'll go somewhere where they don't
[1:03:18] preach on them things
[1:03:22] you'll build it
[1:03:26] I hope you got that point on me well
[1:03:29] look
[1:03:30] he was revealed in the church ages the
[1:03:32] son of God
[1:03:33] it's been the Holy Ghost in every Church
[1:03:35] age
[1:03:37] come on 464 silver
[1:03:39] justification sanctification baptism
[1:03:41] Holy Ghost
[1:03:44] and another great prophet sent
[1:03:48] he refers to and I'll give you the
[1:03:50] quotes before Azusa Street is referred
[1:03:52] to as the prophet
[1:03:55] he said the Holy Ghost came himself
[1:03:59] on the day of Pentecost Noosa Street
[1:04:01] Pentecost
[1:04:03] then the word comes
[1:04:06] 2 36. then he would really reveal this
[1:04:09] son of man when the son of man is being
[1:04:11] revealed God manifested amongst the
[1:04:15] human beings
[1:04:19] like it was then son of man prophetic
[1:04:24] Malachi 4 is Promised a Seer to come
[1:04:27] forth with a voice
[1:04:28] come on Ron
[1:04:30] well how do you read that God manifests
[1:04:34] amongst the human beings
[1:04:37] well that was brother Branham when he
[1:04:39] come to preach
[1:04:41] he was amongst the human beings Glory
[1:04:47] that's good well now in a minute
[1:04:51] when we read it's in the people
[1:04:56] are you going to shout about that
[1:05:01] remember this morning raise your hand if
[1:05:04] you think he got the Holy Ghost raise
[1:05:06] your hand if you think he brought raise
[1:05:08] your hand if you believe the bride's
[1:05:09] going to be the fullness
[1:05:11] well I'll go so far wait a minute my
[1:05:14] hand not getting up very good
[1:05:18] but see that's what most people believe
[1:05:20] that's saying when the son of man is
[1:05:22] being revealed
[1:05:23] God among God manifested amongst the
[1:05:27] human beings like it was then son of man
[1:05:30] Prophet okay we go brother Brandon was
[1:05:32] the prophet
[1:05:34] he had the resurrection message
[1:05:38] he had the dead raising message
[1:05:42] physically and spiritually
[1:05:45] all right
[1:05:47] well now let's read on a little
[1:05:50] go to the next one number 12.
[1:05:53] which is the unveiling of God
[1:05:55] 1964. paragraph 73.
[1:05:59] far for his acts now remember he's in
[1:06:02] the acts of a play
[1:06:04] it's on the unveiling of God if I was
[1:06:06] taken he said and that he just acted the
[1:06:09] part of death
[1:06:11] because all of this is acting
[1:06:14] but remember you got to have characters
[1:06:16] if you're going to have acting
[1:06:18] right
[1:06:19] for for his acts to change
[1:06:22] he changes his form
[1:06:24] then he came the son of man
[1:06:27] now what
[1:06:29] divide that so don't read that he came
[1:06:32] the son of man and then thank the next
[1:06:34] go watch he came the son of man
[1:06:38] now it starts you sinning for the
[1:06:40] reformers age Wesley Luther and all down
[1:06:42] through then we find out they got it so
[1:06:44] bundle up just like the Israelites did
[1:06:46] then when he does appear in the last
[1:06:49] days in the Pentecostal age as the Holy
[1:06:53] Spirit they reject it they did the same
[1:06:56] thing Israel did
[1:06:58] and what does he do now
[1:07:02] he's going to be rejected in any returns
[1:07:05] as son of man and then from that
[1:07:09] Senator David see how close we are son
[1:07:12] of man son of David Son of God is
[1:07:14] revealed in the last days of Son of Man
[1:07:17] according to Malachi 4 all the rest of
[1:07:20] her prophecies pertaining to this hour
[1:07:25] no more dealing with
[1:07:27] the church after he they put him out
[1:07:30] on the outside knocking at the door
[1:07:34] some predestinated seed in there yet we
[1:07:37] he must get to them
[1:07:40] now
[1:07:42] we know brother random was put out
[1:07:46] we know that you know they finally got
[1:07:49] where they wouldn't even Marley nobody
[1:07:50] wanting him
[1:07:53] but really where is he at now
[1:07:59] the first sermon I preached in this Lula
[1:08:03] was not at this church it was the week
[1:08:05] before in my home and in the next week
[1:08:07] here
[1:08:09] was going Beyond man's camp
[1:08:13] because that was 71.
[1:08:17] and it already started camping down
[1:08:20] and I preached going Beyond man's camp
[1:08:24] and you know what they've done we're
[1:08:25] going Beyond man's Camp let us go out
[1:08:27] unto him
[1:08:32] you realize if he's out of church sister
[1:08:34] Gail we better get out of it
[1:08:37] you remember the Catholic priest on the
[1:08:39] message
[1:08:40] he said we've either got to get to
[1:08:43] church straight or get out of the church
[1:08:47] he's seen that much
[1:08:50] if God is outside the church where you
[1:08:52] want to be right
[1:08:53] right but I'm going in there to try to
[1:08:55] help him yeah
[1:08:56] they went to nice here to try to help
[1:08:58] them and they brought out a trinity
[1:09:00] Doctrine and finally developed what do
[1:09:02] you want
[1:09:04] and I'm not against going anywhere
[1:09:06] as a matter of fact I've told you
[1:09:09] I ain't saying I won't go nowhere else
[1:09:11] and preach I didn't say that but I'm
[1:09:13] through with trying to preach outside of
[1:09:15] this church
[1:09:16] but I'd rather go right over there and
[1:09:17] preach in that
[1:09:19] Baptist non-denominational church
[1:09:25] than to try to go to
[1:09:27] people in this message and preach
[1:09:30] you can say what you want to about me
[1:09:32] you want internet anybody we ain't
[1:09:34] paying you
[1:09:35] and you ain't paying us
[1:09:40] because
[1:09:41] they've already shut you out
[1:09:45] oh yeah I can call them up on the phone
[1:09:47] I'm going to be in your community next
[1:09:49] week you know I thought it might come by
[1:09:51] and preach for you that's what they tell
[1:09:53] me you know well how can you turn down a
[1:09:55] guy which tells you that
[1:09:59] fella came one time me and brother dick
[1:10:01] was outside the man came up he was
[1:10:04] supposed to come and sing
[1:10:07] he called me one to come and sing I said
[1:10:09] come right on I never mentioned
[1:10:10] preaching
[1:10:12] brother dick knows what happened man
[1:10:14] came up me and brother Dick and him were
[1:10:15] standing there talking he reached over
[1:10:17] in his car and he said I want to preach
[1:10:18] today I better get my stuff in you under
[1:10:20] get ready
[1:10:21] brother dick looked at me and said he
[1:10:22] gonna preach I said I reckon he is
[1:10:30] I mean
[1:10:33] but my phone don't never ring
[1:10:36] to go anywhere to preach
[1:10:39] well I'm not sad at that
[1:10:42] I'm glad
[1:10:43] my voice is wearing out my body's
[1:10:45] wearing out it's the best for me to just
[1:10:47] to stay home be the best I can
[1:10:51] I'm just
[1:10:53] if I quit I just sat down here
[1:10:56] do not worry about it but why
[1:10:58] me be concerned with trying to go help
[1:11:00] somebody you go preach in their Church
[1:11:03] amen
[1:11:05] Wade went one the other day man got it
[1:11:07] behind him you know and said now if
[1:11:08] there's any seed in it not work seed to
[1:11:10] just throw it out
[1:11:12] I got up and said
[1:11:14] tell me where the seed is
[1:11:17] you know
[1:11:20] but that's the way things will go
[1:11:25] where are we at
[1:11:27] we turn the son of man then son of David
[1:11:29] how close we are
[1:11:31] look where we're at go to the next one
[1:11:33] he's outside the church the Son of God
[1:11:35] trying to reveal himself as son of man
[1:11:39] and look as I said brother Brandon was
[1:11:41] welcomed in his early Ministry
[1:11:45] everybody wanted him
[1:11:47] oh he's got some strange Doctrine about
[1:11:49] serpent seed but we still want him
[1:11:51] because he draws a big crowd and we get
[1:11:53] the big old keep my money out of it you
[1:11:55] know and we get a lot of people come in
[1:11:57] our churches
[1:11:59] well isn't it odd that's the way it was
[1:12:00] with the Lord Jesus
[1:12:03] the young Prophet From Galilee was
[1:12:06] welcomed
[1:12:08] but when he began to say I'm my father
[1:12:10] won
[1:12:12] he wasn't too welcomed
[1:12:14] look what he said on the unveiling of
[1:12:15] God paragraph 8184. oh brother sister
[1:12:18] are you catching it congregation says
[1:12:20] amen look don't don't you see it it's
[1:12:23] been veiled through these ages
[1:12:27] okay
[1:12:28] according to what God Said and it will
[1:12:30] be opened in the last days those Seven
[1:12:32] Seals would be broke and the full thing
[1:12:35] would come into view of the people
[1:12:36] what's took place all along
[1:12:39] the hour of the seventh Angels message
[1:12:43] black
[1:12:45] all the mysteries of God should be made
[1:12:47] known in that Elijah this last hour how
[1:12:51] that Christ is put out of his church the
[1:12:53] son of God
[1:12:55] how he is revealed the son of man again
[1:12:59] how that the church is to be put in
[1:13:02] order
[1:13:03] and everything for the last days they no
[1:13:07] Creed no denomination
[1:13:09] you remember that quote from
[1:13:11] the message on the fullness of the
[1:13:14] godhead bodily put it around and said no
[1:13:15] leaven among her brings the fullness of
[1:13:17] the godhead
[1:13:19] no Creed no denominator absolutely the
[1:13:22] word living in the individual I'll take
[1:13:24] one and leave one now you ain't dealing
[1:13:27] with just a prophet right I'll take this
[1:13:29] and leave that one that's just there's
[1:13:31] no strings no denomination no bindings
[1:13:34] or nothing it's the it's the heart with
[1:13:38] God in him
[1:13:40] alone he said see
[1:13:46] look at the next one
[1:13:48] the rapture
[1:13:51] preacher 65 1204 paragraph 117.
[1:13:55] and now that's the age that we're living
[1:13:57] in right now the seventh Church age
[1:14:00] now it's all to be manifest in the grain
[1:14:03] of wheat
[1:14:04] at the end
[1:14:07] now are you with me did have the all of
[1:14:10] the message that I preached about the
[1:14:12] grain of wheat
[1:14:13] original to come back if you lost that
[1:14:16] if not not back about three months ago
[1:14:18] and start listening over and come up to
[1:14:20] where we're at you'll see what I'm
[1:14:22] talking about notice it's all to be
[1:14:24] manifested in the grain of wheat at the
[1:14:26] end
[1:14:27] another comeback
[1:14:29] now if you'll take Luke the 17th chapter
[1:14:32] and the 30th verse
[1:14:34] he's referring to the grain of wheat
[1:14:41] and it wasn't today so start of social
[1:14:43] being the coming of the son of man when
[1:14:45] the son of man begins to reveal himself
[1:14:47] what is revealed make his revelation of
[1:14:50] what he is in this day
[1:14:52] revealed
[1:14:54] reveal out to the people the word that's
[1:14:57] made known for the day revealed to the
[1:15:00] People by the manifestation of the Holy
[1:15:03] Spirit making that Jesus live among us
[1:15:09] all right
[1:15:11] that's a promise for this age
[1:15:14] let me get
[1:15:18] okay
[1:15:20] point of wheat
[1:15:25] bypass 15 go to 16.
[1:15:31] the unveiling of God paragraph 3 18 and
[1:15:34] the remember the grain must be
[1:15:35] germatized see
[1:15:37] come back to Perfection back to regular
[1:15:40] grain again all right
[1:15:43] the grain must be germatized see if it
[1:15:45] don't it won't live see none of that was
[1:15:48] outside of them messages
[1:15:50] will ever come to life
[1:15:53] look how straight a man could talk
[1:15:56] huh
[1:15:57] you'd have to be dramatized to it but
[1:16:00] remember the same life that was in the
[1:16:02] stalk
[1:16:03] is in the grain it's just maturing
[1:16:05] itself right back see there see he
[1:16:09] revealed himself what son of man the
[1:16:12] grain that went into the ground
[1:16:15] get the message
[1:16:17] congregation says amen
[1:16:19] oh boy
[1:16:21] ain't that something amen
[1:16:24] where are they now
[1:16:26] the Greek said to him we would see Jesus
[1:16:29] he said except the grain of corn fall
[1:16:32] into the ground
[1:16:34] see all right
[1:16:36] now the end right there
[1:16:38] by saying this
[1:16:40] go listen just
[1:16:42] sir as we would see Jesus
[1:16:45] and see if it's not referring that
[1:16:49] when
[1:16:50] they come to Jesus
[1:16:53] they come to see God
[1:16:57] you'll get the message
[1:17:00] when they come to see Jesus sirs we
[1:17:02] would see Jesus they wouldn't say and we
[1:17:04] want to see Jesus
[1:17:06] you know they knew that had to be part
[1:17:09] they wanted to see God
[1:17:14] come on get it listen to the table see
[1:17:16] what your Prophet said
[1:17:17] they wanted to see God I'll bring it in
[1:17:19] the next message nothing else
[1:17:24] when they got to her
[1:17:26] they wanted to see God
[1:17:29] but what did God say
[1:17:33] God said lest the corner wheat dies and
[1:17:35] go to the ground it'll abide alone
[1:17:40] if it goes forth he'll come forth a
[1:17:42] month before
[1:17:47] they wanted to see God
[1:17:49] the only way you'll ever see God
[1:17:51] is through the grain of wheat that goes
[1:17:53] into the ground
[1:17:55] the grain of wheat is the word
[1:18:00] the son of man
[1:18:03] is the only sower of the seed that there
[1:18:05] is
[1:18:08] that's why brother Branham listen
[1:18:11] could stand here in the end time to not
[1:18:13] give us a different Revelation but could
[1:18:15] tell us what no man
[1:18:19] could ever tell you
[1:18:23] the Lord Jesus preached six seals in
[1:18:25] Matthew 24.
[1:18:29] he didn't preach the seventh
[1:18:32] am I right
[1:18:36] and see a Prophet come taking us into
[1:18:40] not what Jesus didn't preach
[1:18:43] I don't believe that
[1:18:45] I don't believe brother Randall could
[1:18:46] bring anything to you and I that
[1:18:48] wouldn't end the word of God
[1:18:52] see Jesus knew he was the corn of wheat
[1:18:54] that was going into the ground
[1:18:56] and you remember the message the corner
[1:18:58] of wheat had to go into the ground in
[1:18:59] the dark ages to the church
[1:19:01] are you with me still in the message but
[1:19:04] promised to be restored to the full
[1:19:05] original grain again in the end time
[1:19:08] in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:19:12] I'm just trying to tell us who we are
[1:19:17] I wish to God at some way and I had a
[1:19:19] great education some words or something
[1:19:21] to be able to express it
[1:19:26] somebody has got to make the word
[1:19:29] manifest
[1:19:31] I didn't write the message I wasn't the
[1:19:34] prophet that said the bride is to
[1:19:36] vindicate Malachi for
[1:19:38] vindicate Luke 17 30 vindicate
[1:19:42] Revelations 10 7 and these other things
[1:19:45] well I didn't know he'd said that
[1:19:49] you got a computer running in if you
[1:19:51] ain't call me
[1:19:53] when I put it on the message a dozen
[1:19:55] times
[1:19:59] the man told me one time he said
[1:20:01] something I said you hang on a minute
[1:20:04] I gotta go far at my computer
[1:20:07] because my natural computer says right
[1:20:09] around said so and so that's my brain
[1:20:13] but you don't you won't believe my brain
[1:20:18] so if I can't find it
[1:20:22] if I can't find that quote for you
[1:20:25] and he just said what I said
[1:20:29] I'll send you an apology and you can
[1:20:33] send it to the world that I'm a false
[1:20:35] prophet
[1:20:39] I said because I know he said it
[1:20:41] I just don't have the memory to tell you
[1:20:44] the page number
[1:20:47] I reckon he
[1:20:48] figured if I was that straight about it
[1:20:51] then I knew what I was talking about
[1:20:57] but that's where people think well I
[1:20:58] don't know he said that
[1:21:00] that's why I read it
[1:21:03] you can't argue with me about what I
[1:21:05] read
[1:21:07] right
[1:21:09] come on musicians
[1:21:11] we'll make a number three out of this
[1:21:13] thing
[1:21:16] let's see church I'm just trying my best
[1:21:19] because you and I to realize
[1:21:21] what God has made us
[1:21:25] it is he that hath made us the scripture
[1:21:27] said
[1:21:28] and not we are saved
[1:21:31] the Bible says you can't even
[1:21:34] that was written before to come up with
[1:21:36] all his paintings to said you can't add
[1:21:39] no color to you however nowadays they
[1:21:41] add color to it you can't add one heart
[1:21:43] to it now you just go get your
[1:21:44] transplant and I'm not against that I'm
[1:21:46] just saying what the Bible says
[1:21:53] it used to be a movie I remember years
[1:21:55] ago you probably remember was called a
[1:21:57] million dollar man I got blowed up and
[1:21:59] they had a few parts left and they had
[1:22:02] you know parts of it and they put it
[1:22:04] back and they just made him a bionic
[1:22:06] body
[1:22:07] told him a Million Dollar Man Danny
[1:22:09] sitting back there he's almost a million
[1:22:11] because he got a million yeah
[1:22:13] he pretty close
[1:22:15] he goes by he goes by a guy or Cannery
[1:22:21] they take his gold hung up in there
[1:22:25] but now
[1:22:27] they've got almost total bodies
[1:22:30] made from
[1:22:32] material
[1:22:34] brought around and said they broke into
[1:22:36] God's Laboratory
[1:22:41] it's amazing what mankind can do
[1:22:46] but his member is because God give him
[1:22:49] the ability
[1:22:50] let's stand well
[1:22:57] number three anybody have a need
[1:23:01] go ahead
[1:23:08] they come from
[1:23:20] thank you
[1:23:41] something bothering her in this sinus
[1:23:45] problem
[1:23:47] let's just believe
[1:23:49] doctors have done all they can do and
[1:23:51] you know
[1:23:54] but we know who the real healer is
[1:23:57] right so let's believe father
[1:24:00] in the name of Jesus Christ the one
[1:24:02] we've talked about today
[1:24:04] we lay our hands upon our wife as a poor
[1:24:06] example but as to do what your word said
[1:24:09] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:24:10] recover
[1:24:11] Satan replace the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:24:14] between our wife and you about this
[1:24:16] hurting and our wife's jaw or her
[1:24:19] sinuses or whatever it is and her teeth
[1:24:21] or gums and we ask you Lord Jesus to
[1:24:25] just stand there in the way and forbid
[1:24:28] Satan in this that he's trying to break
[1:24:31] up on the body we believe you and we
[1:24:33] thank you and we thank you Lord for your
[1:24:36] love in Jesus name amen
[1:24:47] think about it
[1:24:50] be free
[1:25:03] for me
[1:25:08] what happened
[1:25:23] the holy place I can't sing so you help
[1:25:27] me go ahead
[1:25:36] the way what is it is
[1:25:53] a wonderful hour that we're living in
[1:25:57] just recognize Who We Are
[1:26:04] fun
[1:26:10] you raise your hand in the same we
[1:26:12] believe with the bride of Christ
[1:26:15] I'm just trying to get you to look at
[1:26:17] what the Bible and the prophet said
[1:26:19] about this ride
[1:26:27] the Bible gives a beautiful picture like
[1:26:30] Wade was saying Wednesday night you get
[1:26:32] over Revelation 21.
[1:26:34] John deceives the city describes the
[1:26:37] pride season Brian describes the city
[1:26:43] you can't tell the difference
[1:26:46] because it's what he'd done for us
[1:26:51] don't see it
[1:26:53] why
[1:26:58] I believe everything that Prophet says
[1:27:09] I believe he was a mild piece of God
[1:27:15] well why can't you believe what he says
[1:27:18] about you
[1:27:24] well
[1:27:26] I believe he would talk about somebody
[1:27:30] but I'm not good enough
[1:27:33] thank you
[1:27:34] well neither are they
[1:27:37] you know I mean you name me somebody do
[1:27:39] you think is good enough
[1:27:41] you know we are in the days when they
[1:27:43] can't get somebody to run for president
[1:27:45] because then every time they start to
