and the Saints in India especially from my dad and my mom they send their love and respects the greetings to each one of you greetings from the orphans and the old age and the lepers and we would like to say thank you for all your love uh the burden and the great sacrifice you people are doing Amen to stand behind the ministry and to support it we are thankful to you and we appreciate each one of you for the for the great sacrifice amen I believe my words are not enough to thank you all but what can we give to you for what you have done but brother sister I stand in the presence of the Lord and I say you people your sins are in our hearts and in our prayers and I pray that God uh has kept a great reward for each one of you for the sacrifice you have made am there's a crown waiting for you God bless each one of you appreciate uh and love you um the book of Ephesians chapter 2 I would like to read uh two verses from there and maybe we can go from verse one later on but uh verse 8 and N uh very simple scripture but you I know you all are familiar with it uh we're say for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast amen may God bless the reading of his word thank you very much you all may be seated it's good to be in the house of the Lord and uh it's such a blessing uh to uh stand before you Saints and uh I count it as a great privilege I thank the Lord for his grace upon my life that he made it possible that I could come and visit your Saints and stand before you share the word of God what God has laid on my heart I would like to thank uh uh Pastor Samuel Dale and the family brother Wade and each one of you for giving me this opportunity that I could come and share the word of God I would like to thank each one of you and uh if you want a title uh for today this morning uh on the basis of the scriptures what we have read and I would title like this Undisputed value of Faith amen now the faith we are talking about it is the faith of God we are talking about the faith which God has given us by his grace and the Bible tells us that uh the faith which is given to us God has given us by measure and the proportion uh so we each one have faith in our lives and uh we cannot deny that we don't have faith because the Bible says we have received Faith from God and he has given us by measure and by proportion right amen amen but what we have to do is we need to exercise our faith and uh uh asking God for his help so that our faith will be increased Glory like our Prophet taught us that we could pray for every thing or anything that's in the world but he said the greatest prayer you can pray to to uh plead him Lord increased my faith right you know and and uh faith has got a tremendous value I would like to uh just read something for you if you don't mind and uh you know uh someone uh would say what good would it uh do to have faith and and the prophet of God God makes a statement he said faith can sign my pardon sure there's value in faith glory and that's where I got my thought Undisputed value of Faith now you can dispute about anything that's in the world you can dispute about the structure of the building the value of the building you can dispute uh on the measurements of the building or the area of the building you know you can you can about anything you want to you know you can have a dispute about a property a piece of ground and you can you can dispute uh whatever opinion you got and uh you you can take anything that's in the world and and you can dispute it you can you can argue with it you can you can give your opinion you can you can give your negatives you can give your positives you can give your best of your opinions you can give the worst opinions you know you can dispute with any anything that's in the world but brother sister we are talking about something that cannot be disputed it is an Undisputed value that faith has God and brother sister this Faith you know uh the as the prophet of God has taught us that it can sign our pardon and not only the prophet of God but before the prophet of God came into the scene the Bible is already being written by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost amen and if you if you can and say Amen to the word of God that will really bless your heart brother sister you know this word of God is given by inspiration for our betterment for our blessings for our you know edifying uh edification of our spiritual life and and and Paul speaks to the to the church in Ephesians here and he speaks to the people who are saved he's talking to Christians he's not talking here to the unbelievers he talking to the people who have already known Christ and they knew the power of the Deliverance they knew the power of the Holy Ghost they knew what God has done in their lives they have experienced they have tasted God in their lives what God has done uh who is rich in Mercy and think about this brother sister and the Bible you know the the very first words it says he said and you have quaken who were dead in trespasses and sin sir you know when we when we think about our natural birth when we look about our natural uh Instinct in in life you know we are no good there is nothing good there is no righteousness in us there is no goodness in us there is there is there was nothing that God could see and and you know you know uh feel good about us because the Bible says we were brought and brought up and we were shaved in sin and we were shaved in and we came into this world speaking lives but thank God before the world was ever founded or put foundation To The World God knew us and that makes him a infinite God that makes him almighty God that makes him a powerful God that makes him as a alls sufficient God are you with me brothers and sisters that makes him a wonderful savior but you know when we come into this world we come with the natural desire of our of our father and mother we were born in sin we were shaped in an equity but he knew us because he chosen us he knew us before the foundation of the world I'm so grateful and thankful to God and that's the reason we have come to our place that's the reason we have come to our position where we can say yes Lord I believe in you I trust in you because the faith he has given to me and that faith has helped me to believe that there is only one God there is no other now you know in America or the Western world has has only known about a God and and and and and the and the God name is is Lord Jesus Christ now you you have Catholics in this country you got all kinds of uh Christian uh different Christian churches in America in England in the Western and the European world but I come from a country which has got 33 Millions gods and goddess can you imagine brother sister you have only about one God but I heard about God who are 33 Millions gods and goddesses you can point out that is their God right right now you know this is on the internet this service is on the internet right and and you know I've got enough sense what I'm talking about today because there may be some people in India you know listening to this message what I'm saying but you know this is the very truth that I come from a country which has got 33 Millions gods and goddesses but think about the faith I'm talking about today think about the grace that I have received in my heart today think about the mercies of the Living God that God has opened eyes and my understanding to see that there's only one God only one true Living God and I was dead in sin and in trespasses but thank God when I was dead when I was dirty when I was you know there was nothing good in me that God could look look upon but yet he loved me yet he he showed me his love yet he showed me his grace he showed me his mercy and he quickened me amen hallelujah he quickened me to live he quickened me to eternal life he quickened me to see the the depth of God's love for my life hallelujah amen it says when in time pass he walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of R even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love right we cannot measure his love right we we cannot know the depth of his love if I know the depth of the love of God I know only in the portion in the in the in the uh little portion of it but you know I have never known what is the depth but you know thank God that he has opened our eyes to see his great love Glory which we cannot measure which we which our minds cannot fathom Hallelujah where with he loved us oh what a love that is brother and sister if you are loving our Lord Jesus Christ tonight it's nothing great in us we love him because he loved us hallelujah because he first loved us we are loving him today sometimes we think that we are doing a favor to God by coming to church sometimes we think we doing favor to God when we walk according to his word of God you know sometimes we think we do favor to God when we do good things you know we we think we are doing a favor to God when we put our offering but brother sister when you use the electric you have to pay the bill when you use the use the water you have to pay the water bill and you using his oxygen just think about it if the if the payment is not paid and if they cut out your gas or your electricity you have no stuff to cook you may say Brother Sam we have got wood to cook yeah well if the wood gets so then what right that's right you know being traveling in different places he said save the forest save the forest that shows the forest is you know people are cutting lot of wood you know and and and and wildfires you know and and they have a sign that say you can you can stop wildf fires so there are a lot of things happening brother sister but just think about it you know we think that we are doing a favor to God by coming to the church but remember we are just doing it because we love him it's it's not a compulsion no nothing is compulsory now God is a gentleman the Bible says right he doesn't pushes anybody exactly he puts you know in front of you life and death you choose life you have chosen the right if you choose that it's up to you there are two roads one is the toll has been paid but if you don't want to take that road which is the the toll has been paid then you have to keep on paying from your pocket because you chose the road right exactly you know so so we need to be careful in what we're doing what we're saying but brother sister we are talking about faith and you know that has got a great value right a tremendous value for the faith right amen just I want you to to to uh you know follow my thought little bit and and and the Bible I want to go a little further it says but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love where with he loved us even when we were dead in sins had quaken us together with Christ by Grace he are saved only by the grace of God we are saved I am saved you are saved it's the same Grace and brother sister when that cap Stone comes down amen when that headstone comes down it will be only Grace and nothing else Hallelujah the Bible says it will be only Grace if you are getting ready yourself and you're believing it's just the grace that you will be in the Rapture it will take the grace of God it will take your faith it will take my faith in the word of God to be in the lure amen amen nothing else exactly so we we have thankful to God for his grace today amen amen he said by Grace ye are saved and have raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen we are sitting now in the Heavenly places he has raised us from that pit of sin he has raised us from the mighty clay amen and he has you know put us in the in the Heavenly places and which we are ever grateful to God amen amen right that in the ages to come he might show us the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness towards kindness towards us toward us through Christ Jesus I thank God for this scripture that's been fulfilled in our day amen that the great mysteries of God has been come open exctly amen thank God that the book was taken right amen thank God that the book was opened by the lamb that's right it was not opened by any man right no man was worthy no in heaven amen on the earth beneath the Earth whatever whever there was no one worthy not even to look into it not even to touch it not even to open it but thank God there was somebody who was kinman to us who was a kinman you know relative to us a blood relative to us hallelujah oh brother he came and you know he took that book and that wiped out tears from the eyes of John and he began to scream he began to shout and he began to worship right when he began to worship the whole Heaven heard it the whole earth heard it amen how about our worship today amen that's right I believe whether he crosses this ceiling or not I don't know but when we see ourselves Redeemed by the by the blood of the Lamb sir amen that's right oh yesterday we had that wonderful time right Plan of Redemption how God redeemed his bride how God will redeem his 144,000 people in Israel how wonderful is to see the Plan of Redemption and brother sister when we see that we are redeemed and when we see our name when I see my name I cannot hold my peace I cannot keep quiet I cannot just my hands and sit out and canot shut up my mouth brother sister when I see my name I will scream like Jun whether people like it or not whether people agree with it or not whether people love it or not brother I will scream because I am redeemed I am free than you Lord I am free yes sir praise God I am free amen and I'm not in the boundage and what made me free what saved me is just the grace of God and my faith in that Grace amen just think about it a tremendous importance and value God has kept in that Faith right that's why we need Faith yes sir by faith we are saved and by faith we stay saved right amen I'm sorry English is the language I learned but I hope you understand what I'm saying good yes by faith we are saved yes and we Stay Saved By Faith amen if you want to be saved you need to keep your faith alive right amen exactly that's the TR we cannot have faith on Sunday and no faith on Monday amen exactly yes sir you know we will have faith on Wednesday and no faith on Thursday that is not going to work amen we need to have faith every minute every second in our life brother we as our brother was quoting I was listening in the office he said we are living in such a bad time if you say we are living in a bad time which I do agree with you and I know if you're living in the bad time then we need a good faith we need a Divine Faith Of God every moment in this bad time now Faith is such a thing faith is such a a wonderful blessing God God has given into our hands in our lives and that Faith Can you know change that faith can bring Wonders that Faith Can you know change and face any situation it want that's correct only faith can do that and that's the reason Paul writes in catian chap 1 from verse 21 to 233 he says and you know and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked words yet now had he reconciled right we are reconciled people yes sir we are one with Christ amen we believe in his word we believe we are his children right you know we are walking in his ways praise the Lord and verse 22 he says in the blood in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy unblameable and unreprovable in his sight that's right there are three things here he wants you to PR be present to him and he did it by the death of his flesh he a presently holy unblamable right and repr provable in his side amen now if there is anybody's going to judge us it's going to be him right amen if anything you know if we are judged by we are going to be judged by him right through him through his word so he wants to see us when it comes to get us you know and take us home he wants to see us holy right because our God is Holy amen yes sir and no Unholy person can stand before him no Unholy thing can stand before him only the thing which is holy right because our God is Holy you tell brother Tam is there any other way there is no other way he's a holy God Amen he is a jealous God yes sir oh he's a consuming fire Glory oh brother sister that's the you know God is love that's only one side of God but the other side is a jealous God he's a holy God he loves Sinners but not the sins he hates sin Hallelujah he hates sin yes sir but he loves The Sinner that's the great part of my God that is the greatness of my God hallelujah he wants to present you holy right unblameable unre provable if we continue in faith that's right brother that's what we need to do today sir we need to continue in faith not only continue in faith but grounded and settled amen and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel amen right right think about it brother sister yes sir many people they are degrading the word of God many people they don't want even the Bibles in their hands anymore they think the word of God is is a history today you know they only say oh we got the message you know the message is the absolute I believe the message is the absolute but where did the message come if there was no Bible if there was no Bible how the message would come to us brother the message came from the Bible the message is the Bible because of the Bible the message is in our hands Hallelujah thank you Lord right yes we need to give great regard and great respect to the word of Goden and brother sister nothing can take this place nothing can you know of course I know let C you cannot put the word of God in the pages of this book you know and and boast about it but you know the prophet of God said you need to take the word of God from all the pages and bring it into our and the Holy Ghost will take it water it and it will you know grow it will bring the produce the word will come into action amen but we cannot in no way degrade the word of God right yes sir that's what Paul says y we must be you know continuing in faith grounded and settled right and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which is the word of God this word gives us a right up amen there's no book in this world like this book that's right amen amen there are millions and trillions of books y hundreds of millions of books are written all over the world right mhm with different titles and different you know names of the book of different topics or subject whatever you call you know but a person begin to read a book he can close the book you know what he may give his opinion said oh my you know this author might should have put this thing in different way like this or he might have wrote like this he might have wrote like this but brother sister you know about this author about this book there is no man that was born in this world there will be no man that will be born in this world that could come and say oh this word might have written like this or this should have been written like this because this is the word amen this word yes sir is alive today and if you ask me where is that word alive it's in us it's in me and the word of God is Not only alive but it is in continuity amen I thank God for his grace amen amen that this word has given us the Hope y hope for our healer right right hope that will never put us to s I hope that we will be the leure I hope that no book can give that's right oh the very word bible if you can just look into it I got two arations Believers instruction before leaving Earth yeah B yeah Believers instruction before leaving Earth there is another approvation I have known he said behold I bring life eternal amly amen they say what my Bible amen right and this gives me great hope yes sir behold I bring life eternal every person that wants eternal life has to come to this word of God this book yes sir oh brother sister we got some beautiful beautiful books in India called Ram mahab back yeah these are the holy books of the religion the Buddhist have got books oh yeah the Muslims Muslim Brothers have got books sure sure every religion has got book right but no book says like this book says no book said behold I bring eternal life no book said you know give instruction to the Believers how to live the life in this world and get into the no book tells that but I thank God for this book right right it gives me eternal life amen oh my brothers my sister just think about it this book gives us hope this gospel gives us hope which you have heard which was preached to every creature which is under heaven let of our Paul and Minister amen that's why we believe in this word yes sir that's why we put our trust in the word of God Amen that's why we walk by faith in the word and not by sight right amen the faith which we have right helps us to walk y right exactly it helps us to walk in the deepest valley right the darkest Valley it helps us to have strength yes sir yeah it helps us to Have Courage yeah I would like you to just you know follow a little bit with me the book of Hebrews 10: 22 and 23 says let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith right what gives us Assurance the gospel amen the word of Goden this gives us a full assurance and the and and the Apostle Paul says let us draw near with the True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with the pure water amen then he says let us hold fast the preparation of our faith right yeah let us hold fast to what we have confessed profession is confession of our faith without wavering right amen the Bible is asking us not to wav right now there are two reasons we should not waver right the Book of James chap 1 verse 6 and 7 it says ver six but let him ask in faith right not nothing wavering exactly for he that Werth is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and TOS right right y the Bible is asking us not to we right right he wants us to be grounded and settled in faith amen right and we need to continue there on right it's not one day one week it's every moment of our life we need to continue in faith no matter what situation comes no matter what sickness we have no matter what the doctors are saying no matter what the people are saying no matter what the other churches are saying we need to just keep on continuing and grounded and without wa we need to be settled in faith he says he says but let him ask in faith nothing waving for he that is like a way of the sea driven with the wind and TS power let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord right you cannot even imagine if your faith is wavering come on if your faith is shaken yeah whether God can do this do that right is it possible the doctors has said you will die yeah you know there is no hope the Medical Science has done its best and there is no hope but I am a Christian I am a believer can do anything to me yes he already spoken in his word by his tribes you are healed now that's his word if he says by his Tripes you are healed you are healed if you say I'm not healed I have the problem it's because you're lacking fath right exactly amen right amen come on think about it my brothers my sisters amen that's the first thing if you were you will be driven with the wind and passed up and down right exactly we cannot be in that position and think that God will answer our prayer now the second reason second reason that we should not waver in our faith Hebrews 11:39 and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better things for us that they without us should not be made perfect can you see the second reason we have got something better than all those people that's right yes sir right yes sir on and I could say we got the best things that the whole history of mankind we got the best thing what they yes sir you canar it and see yeah now we you know brother says I preach only what Paul preached amen The Book of Revelation was written by Apostle John bless bless Hallelujah and imagine you just saw in some he just saw you know amen and he knew nothing about it now the apostles the children Disciples of Jesus Christ they had a name he said these are the on who turned the world upside down right exactly and they didn't know nothing about what we know today can you imagine brother there's one sitting on the throne yeah there is one sitting on the throne and there are 24 seats which are the 12 patri of the Old Testament and the 12 disciples of the new testament which makes 24 24 is 12 and 12 24 right so there are 24 Elders yeah there's one sitting on the throne but where are you sitting right yeah come on brother amen where are you sitting Glory you are sitting on the throne am we are the queen of Jesus Christ but those 24 were actually you know Taken part to WR to write this book that's correct amen right y few of them were there who wrote this book right right under the anointing under the inspiration of the same holy ghost that we have today but they have not in opposition come on that's right amen EXA they wrote this book so that we could believe we could read this book we can study this book we can medicate on this book day and night and have a fruitful life Glory right and sit on the throne and poor guys poor guys they have their little seats around the and you will be sitting before them I will be sitting before them in the throne on the things they wrote right by believing those things that's right and we are all of them right come on Amen yes sir think about Peter yeah actually he was the one to open the door of Heaven he said whatever you lose I lose in heaven whatever you bind I bind in am he's the key man y That's he's got the authority yep he's the key man and he got the authority and he begin to unloose Y the doors of Heaven that we could go in and set on the throne he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what he was doing he was unlocking the door of Heaven amen well he came into the heaven come on but that very thing has brought us to the throne right which he spake and which he wrote Glory come on can you imagine Brother s that's right can you imagine the book of Acts written by Dr Luke yeah and the prophet said we have the continuation of book of Acts right the word of God is alive in the bright Jesus Christ and we are in continuation of the book of Acts can you imagine Dr R Luke writing this you know book of Acts yeah and we are reading it and believing it and putting the same word into action but this book is not written by drct L this book is not written by Brother Samuel K this book is not written by Brother Samuel de this book is written by the spirit of the Living God we are that book amen now we don't only not only believe this word but this word is in action on because we believe this word that's right oh how wonderful he is hallelujah we should not waver in our faith right we know faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen right that's okay right faith has no problems no it doesn't need no evidence exactly Glory brother we just believed in the Lord Jesus Christ he said let not your heart be troubled we we said Thank you Lord for your word our heart is stable now right right we have confidence by your word amen right and we have never seen Heaven Come on but we believe there is a heaven we never know what is eternal life but we got the the the the uh what do you call the earnest earnest we got the earnest of of the eternal life we got the earnest of the healing we got the earnest of the Resurrection we got the earnest of that eternal life brother sister just think about it we are just having the earnest what it will be when we enter into the it will just take the faith of of you and me right in the word of God come on if you can just believe the word it says faith is a substance of things hoped for right amen if you need something just ask him right exactly just ask him you don't get it today the problem with us is we pray in the morning in the afternoon we want it yeah we pray in the morning we want it somewhere in the night some right but remember our watches doesn't work like his that's the problem that's right but God has given us enough faith enough you know he has taught us to wait right and we can wait upon his word right and waiting gives you the

brother yesterday night I was coming to the church from Brother Ban's house and and immediately I sat in the in the car with him you know I felt somebody was you know poking KN behind my right hip oh yeah and I just just sh up like this in the car I said Lord I Thank you for healing me Lord I Thank you for healing me I rebuke this pain in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by the time I came to the church the pain left it doesn't come it haven't come yet right if it comes I am going to do the same thing every time it comes I'm doing the same thing why I'm saying is you need to exercise your faith and every time the devil brings some things to you do the same thing keep praising God keep thanking for his healing think about it worry doesn't hasn't got one bit of value to it at all right in the message testimony Chicago Illinois 53 paragraph 71 he says wor hasn't got one bit of value to it at all so why you worrying worry that's right amen just what would wor do any good right exactly right amen change that's the prophet prophet's word right the Bible says you ask it in my name my father will give it when he said he will give it he means a friend he's not a Wishy Wasing God no he's not like me if I say something today and change my word tomorrow tomorrow Heaven Earth will pass away but not his word if he said he will give it he will give it but he has his own time right right amen he works according to his own watch not our watch right amen amen he said why would you worry and the worry do any good yeah he said but Faith does do good right so have faith amen Luke 12 verse 25 I would like to quote and he said and which of you with taking thought can add to his sture one cubid which is 18 in yeah verse 26 if he thou be not able to do the thing which is least why take it thought for the rest y why do you think why do you worry yeah that's worry has got no value no right amen what is the value 0% right yeah what you have to do exercise your faith amen the prophet of God in the message faith in action speaking about Noah and his day and its message yeah the prophet G said that he built Ark on the word of God right for the saving of his family he kept on building he had many critics oh yeah lot of critics that's right his SS are much more you know higher level than what we got right you talk about the pyramids being built right the prophet of God said there is no machine that can take that Big Stone today and place it in such a way that has been already placed right he said there's no machine in this present world right I was just talking about the the the the technology the other day you think about the cars you know 50 years back their body was built by 18 or 20 mm gate the body was Heavy tough rather you punch it it will break your bones in your in your that was Heavy strong but you know the science begin to grow the technology begin to grow the more technology it was growing the more better they were coming with sign the more lighter they made today you can take your hand and punch your car it will have a big right dance thank you it will have a big dent why because they're thinking about the marriage they wanted to make the body light and the engine powerful and that's why people are killed so easily right exactly because the car is not built stronger right am that's how about our technology right now what about no's technology right yeah what was the time you know when when they built pyramids right what kind of Technology he said even the razor could not pass through between the stones what kind of Technology it was right right think about it my brothers myself exactly right and he says in spite of all those critics against him he said he just went on believed it was God's word and God is going to perform what he has spoken right amen now Noah kept on holding to that right and then Prophet goes further and he said but faith doesn't look at what a circumstances is Faith doesn't look what circumstances is Right Faith looks to what God says right hallelujah amen if we got faith in us if we say we are believers then we must have faith in us or else without faith we cannot be a believer we can be a make believer we can be unbeliever but if you want to be a believer we need to have faith if we got faith then Faith doesn't look at the circumstance Faith only looks what God says if God says you are healed you are healed now Faith is looking at that amen that's right amen amen Faith doesn't try to reason Faith just takes it at its face value right now that's faith it will take God God's word in his face value Faith knows what is the power in the word of God but when you take that word and put in a human thinking or imagination right there all the problems comes amen yeah is this possible is this amen okay but the faith takes it at its face value exactly that's what we need to do in our Amen brother sister we cannot dispute it just take the word of God just believe it amen how to build it just blindly right Hallelujah sir I believe this is the true word of God Amen yes sir we need to just believe it amen if you talk about believing you know the prophet of God said you may have lot of things to hinder you like that little you know sop phenician woman who came for the healing of her daughter yeah she got a lot of hindrance Y and Jesus went up to a stage and called her a dog indirectly yeah I don't know what will happen if the preacher stands on the pulpit and and calls somebody God oh my you cannot you will not see them back again but I want you to notice something right I want you to notice something that God spoke through the prophet I want you to notice here he said but Faith finds a source yeah no other thing anything no other knows no other blessing no other people or nothing right knows about it Faith finds the source that no one can explain it right it's something you know only faith can see it and then he says faith admits it is right when God called her when Jesus called her a doll indirectly she said yes Lord right right she admitted it right y Faith admits right word right Faith always humbles itself right she said yes Lord Glory I'm not looking for the bread that crumb is enough exactly Faith humbles it right Faith speaks the right word she said yes Lord you right right I'm a heathen yeah I'm a dog you cannot take the bread of a child right and give it to a dog right it's not meat it's not Al to the get right but Lord there's one truth in that when the master eats the bread you know always the crumbs fall give me that crumb Glory can you imagine the the level the faith that woman had brother sister right can we imagine the faith she had yeah come on just think about it the thing that was containing in the bread the things that were present in the bread were present in the crumb and her faith said Lord it is enough that CR is okay for me because it it has the same contains right what the piece of bread has amen that is enough amen we know that bread is Jesus Christ we know that meal is Jesus Christ and that little Crown Y is enough for me amen Lord Faith bless admits the right word yep Faith always humbles Faith only looks for the crumbs not the whole bread right Faith knows no defeat right faith has no right faith has no opposition right faith has got nothing to stop it right oh hallelujah amen nothing can stop Faith nothing can hinder Faith nothing can oppose Faith right right faith is such a that's why the prophet of God said it was a super sense y nothing can stop nothing can hinder right if we can have faith to amen if we can just have faith in the word of God right oh brother sister we will see the blessings of God in our lives we will see the power of God working in our midst in our homes in our lives in our children we will see the power of God moving in our church if you could just have faith like this amen little woman the problem is fear right that's it bu that's the trouble with men tonight y right the trouble with people today is they are scared right that's right I don't blame you people I don't blame anybody because I'm traveling I've I've got some experiences in America amen if you're in the plane yeah some little unusual sound the plane makes Hallelujah right he SC I don't blame that for that yeah the agony the pain they have gone through I don't blame for that right right but the fear has gripped the hearts of the people right you're in a bus station brother sister one little thing one little move somebody makes one little thing somebody speaks a lot people are scar yeah the hearts of the people have been that's right is controlled by the fear right that's correct and I don't blame anybody for that right the problem is fear yeah the he says that's the biggest curse that's right there is on the people right the biggest curse that is on the people is the fear amen oh Hallelujah is there a way out for this brother yes sir amen you replace love right take that fear out put love in his Hallelujah I'll come to that and he says I know that if you can take away you know that that fear and get love in his place something's going to happen amen you need only love yes right we know love is God nothing else God is love love is God and if we have love mhm God will move in our lives right Glory you will see God's power manifesting in our daily lives yes sir you can see it in every step of Our Lives brothers and sisters amen we need to replace that right we need to ask God to take that fear out amen and instead of that put love in our hearts let the love of God be you know shed abroad in our hearts and let the love begin to work amen you know fear has got no value I will read it for you right there's only two faculties that govern a human being one of them is Faith which brings result Faith brings results right and fear has got no value in it at all right faith is of god fear is of the devil right fear makes you weary and wonder but it is of 0% value right exactly Hallelujah absolutely amen can you say amen amen exactly amen this says unbelief can do nothing for you but then right right that's all it can do to destroy you and faith is the only thing that can help you right unbelief there's no value in unbelief at all unbelief accompanies fear when you go through reasoning and wondering then you begin to fear amen it says so fear is no good at all no value in it let's discard the thing all together let's have faith and believe God so it's by faith we know God not by knowledge amen hallelujah amen that's what we today right no fear no worries right many people in this day they looking at the things of the world oh the world is getting better the world is getting worse the yeah we're not expecting anything good but the problem is why our eyes are focusing on the bad things on why can't we focus on the things of God why don't our eyes see the of God the position God has placed the things God has given to us you know the blessings God has given to us the faith he has given to us brother you know we need to face uh Place love in our hearts right amen and love is God Amen that's why we need the Holy Ghost today right without the Holy Ghost we cannot have love amen we cannot have faith because love produces Faith that's what he says here only love produces faith God hats a cover yep love casts out all fear right amen so if you have got love you don't have any fear right fear don't have one bit of value about it no and you and we talk about our prophet and the great things what God has done right and think about you know the prophet of God a little you know little bitty man standing in front of that wild animal and and and he shows he begin to speak with love he said oh creature of God I'm sorry that I'm in your territory right right but I'm not here to hurt you and he doesn't have a gun and this one is is you know scrapping the ground and getting ready to hit the man of God and here he stands full of love and when the love was projected right he conquered that while he just stopped scraping the ground and you know making that dust to fly he just sat down quietly and the prophet went to do the work he came for you remember when he was moving the grass right he hit the uh honey yeah you know honey bees Hornet Hornet and what happened he didn't have shirt on his on his back yeah and they all came and you know how what happens when the hnet you know follows you but you know he began to you know stap and say oh dear creatures of God I didn't mean to hurt your home yeah I'm sorry for what I did and when the law began to project no we all talk like this that's right we like to hear this thing we like to talk like this brother and sister you know want to preach pre it's so good it's so wonderful yeah but we

about the Living God what good of God of history is right what good is right what good a God God of Moses would do right a historical God in India as I told you in the in the beginning there are many
