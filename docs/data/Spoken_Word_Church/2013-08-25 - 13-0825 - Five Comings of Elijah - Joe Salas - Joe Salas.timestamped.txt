[0:15] colors of Elijah
[0:18] my brother talking already preach I told
[0:20] him did you know there were six comments
[0:22] of Elijah and he looked at me like Eli
[0:25] does when I tell him babies don't cry
[0:26] too
[0:28] so when he got through preaching he came
[0:31] back and said guess what there's seven
[0:33] seven he said yeah I got a grandson his
[0:36] name Elijah too so I said well are we in
[0:39] trouble we're trying to start a new
[0:40] doctrine over here
[0:43] okay first game Seventeen one
[0:48] first king 17. now Elijah is going to be
[0:52] our foundation
[0:54] that's where all the spirit goes from
[0:56] each each uh messenger the first I want
[0:59] to read the first seal
[1:01] so just get your bottle ready first game
[1:04] 17-1
[1:09] he was Elijah himself and next time he
[1:12] come he was Elijah the next time he come
[1:16] he was what John the Baptist
[1:18] the next time they come is for the
[1:21] seventh angel and the fifth time he
[1:23] comes with Moses Over Yonder
[1:26] now five if you know your numerals of
[1:28] the Bible five is a number of laboring
[1:31] race and that's what he's done now watch
[1:33] you want to know what it is was Jesus a
[1:36] labor of Grace
[1:39] j e s u s five
[1:42] l-a-b-o-r direct labor or love for you
[1:46] and if you get to him
[1:48] did you get to him how come
[1:51] faith in labor is that right labor is a
[1:55] number of race
[1:56] he said all right to the Believers the
[1:59] first time Elijah there was him the
[2:02] second Was Elijah the Third for John the
[2:05] fourth with the seven Angel of the last
[2:08] Messenger to the church Ace according to
[2:11] Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 7. now that
[2:15] fifth time he's a messenger to the Jews
[2:20] Jews after that church is gone
[2:24] okay that's far away
[2:30] okay first game 17 one
[2:33] and a larger t-shirt who was in heaven
[2:36] and gilia said unto hey there and as the
[2:38] Lord go to Israel let it behold whom I
[2:41] stand with you there shall not be doing
[2:43] I Reign this year but according to my
[2:46] word he had thus said the Lord he can
[2:50] he can start the rain he can stop the
[2:52] rain
[2:53] okay
[2:55] 1841.
[2:58] First Kings 18 41.
[3:08] and Elijah said that I have a Ahab get
[3:11] me up eat and drink or there's a sound
[3:14] abundance of rain he releases the rain
[3:18] okay first
[3:19] of Second Kings one
[3:37] Second Kings 110.
[3:42] and Elijah Anderson said to the captain
[3:45] of 50. I'll be a man of God then let
[3:48] Fire come down from heaven and consume
[3:50] thee and by 50 and there came down from
[3:53] Far From Heaven and consumed him in his
[3:57] 50.
[3:58] so he he can release the rank he can
[4:00] stop the rain he can send fire from
[4:02] heaven
[4:05] okay let's go to Second Kings two
[4:11] to eleven
[4:17] I remember Elijah does not die and all
[4:19] the rest don't die
[4:22] this is saying things to 11 and he came
[4:25] to pass as they still went on and talked
[4:27] that behold they appear and Chariot of
[4:31] fire horses are fire and parted them
[4:33] both asunder and Elijah went
[4:36] up by a whirlwind into heaven so he was
[4:39] taken away so he didn't die
[4:46] okay let's go to Revelations 11.
[4:55] oh no hold on Matthew
[4:59] next time you see Elijah in Matthew 17.
[5:07] Matthew 17.
[5:11] here
[5:30] okay Matthew
[5:32] 17 one two three one two three yeah and
[5:38] Seventeen one two three
[5:44] 's a tug
[5:45] Peter James and John his brothers and
[5:48] bring them up into a high mom apart
[5:51] and was transferred every four of them
[5:54] and his face this shine as the sun and
[5:56] his Ramen was white as the light and
[5:59] behold their appear unto them Moses and
[6:02] Elias talking with him
[6:04] now that's that's the next thing
[6:06] okay let's go to
[6:09] Revelations 11.
[6:12] now I know there's two Jews but I'm
[6:14] tunnel I'm trying to see where each time
[6:17] that Elijah appears
[6:34] Revelations 11 let's start at the third
[6:37] chapter
[6:40] foreign
[7:05] two hundred and three score days clothed
[7:08] in sat cold these are the two olive
[7:10] trees and the two candlesticks standing
[7:13] before the god of the earth and if any
[7:16] man will hurt them fire perceive out of
[7:19] their mouth and their power of their
[7:21] enemies what did Elijah do
[7:30] in this manner be killed these have
[7:34] power to shut the heavens that it rained
[7:36] on a days of their prophecy Elijah
[7:40] and that power over the waters to turn
[7:42] them to blood and to Smite the Earth
[7:44] with all the plagues as often as they
[7:47] will Moses
[7:49] and when they shall have tennis their
[7:52] testimony the Beast they'll send us
[7:55] Spirit shall make war against them and
[7:58] shall overcome them and kill them and
[8:00] their bodies and their dead bodies that
[8:03] lie in the street of the great city
[8:04] which spiritually is called Sodom and
[8:07] Egypt where also our Lord was crucified
[8:10] and they are the people in Cambridge and
[8:13] tongues and Nations shall see their dead
[8:15] bodies three days and a half and shall
[8:18] not suffer the dead virus to be put in
[8:20] Graves and they shall dwell upon the
[8:23] Earth it shall rejoice over them and
[8:25] make mercy and shall send gifts one to
[8:28] another because these two Prophets
[8:31] tormented them they dwell on the earth
[8:34] and after three days and have a spirit
[8:37] of life from God and enter into them and
[8:40] they stood up their feet in a great
[8:43] fearful upon them we saw them and they
[8:46] heard a great voice from Heaven saying
[8:48] unto them come up hither and as they
[8:51] stand up to heaven in a cloud and the
[8:54] enemies beheld him
[9:03] okay
[9:19] and the message that Tim virgin brother
[9:21] and says
[9:24] foreign
[9:50] New Testament and that's wrong that's
[9:52] wrong here's the two witnesses
[9:55] absolutely a return of Moses and Elijah
[9:58] the two witnesses Moses and Elijah come
[10:01] back and preached exactly three and a
[10:04] half years under the anointing other
[10:06] baptism the Holy Ghost for their
[10:08] blessing is still the blessing is taken
[10:11] from that Gentiles and the church is
[10:13] taken up and the co-formal church is
[10:16] hunted like those by the Communists and
[10:18] Roman parties and when they're hunted
[10:21] down and killed they're killed and
[10:23] then these two prophets priests three
[10:25] and a half years and the Bible said that
[10:27] they were killed in the street called
[10:29] spiritually Sodom and Egypt where Lord
[10:32] was crucified
[10:39] now I could I could never get that Moses
[10:43] Moses came back with Elijah because you
[10:46] know he died
[10:48] so I think brother explains it on
[10:53] certain sound
[11:19] now these men are kept Alive by God from
[11:21] their original Ministry for the future
[11:23] service they their service are well just
[11:26] think the spirit of Elijah and ministers
[11:28] five times Moses too what kept
[11:32] what kept alive or further service they
[11:34] were neither one of them dead now don't
[11:37] you believe that they were both seen
[11:38] alive talking to Jesus among
[11:40] Transfiguration the Lord remember they
[11:43] must die right
[11:46] now this is one that uncertain Simon
[11:54] he was revealing himself another fashion
[11:57] what was he in and glorified
[11:59] transfigured condition he's coming the
[12:02] way he's coming and glorify Christ
[12:04] transformed his remake of shining like
[12:06] the son my he stood in the cloud and
[12:09] he's coming in the closing glory Lord
[12:13] Sheriff like love not a little while
[12:19] all these angels with him Hallelujah
[12:22] mind that stuff
[12:23] where he's coming coming in the cloud
[12:27] and we're here's where the question mark
[12:29] had on my heart now notice when they see
[12:31] him stand there and before them I
[12:33] appeared to him Moses and Elijah
[12:35] watch that what did Moses mean Moses
[12:38] represented the one that had died and
[12:42] was sleeping in the grave
[12:44] because Moses died and was buried nobody
[12:47] knew where he was buried at but he
[12:50] represented the ones that were asleep
[12:52] when he comes
[12:55] uh by the way said he was in his
[12:57] glorified body so
[12:59] that the Bible did say that Moses did
[13:02] die and that the only thing that we saw
[13:05] that
[13:07] uh
[13:10] Moses
[13:19] talking about Michael which is Michael
[13:21] which is a the resurrection Angel like I
[13:24] said the Bible said he didn't die so we
[13:25] gotta know
[13:28] okay
[13:30] let's go with Elijah
[13:38] he's got a second Kings too
[13:43] I thought you guys are going to be gone
[14:15] seven Kings two 9-14
[14:22] and they and it came to pass when they
[14:24] were going over that Elijah said unto
[14:27] Elijah that's what I shall do for thee
[14:29] before I be taken away from thee and
[14:31] Elijah said I pray thee that a double
[14:34] portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he
[14:37] said that I was asked a hard thing
[14:39] nevertheless without see me when I'm
[14:42] taken from thee he shall be so unto thee
[14:46] but if not it shall not be sold
[14:48] and it came to pass that there's still
[14:50] an on top that before pull their chair
[14:54] that fire horses and parted
[14:57] them both asunder Elijah went up by all
[15:01] over and into heaven and Elijah sword
[15:03] and Christ my father my father a chair
[15:06] of Israel and Horseman thereof and he
[15:09] saw him no more and he took hold of his
[15:11] own clothes and rented them in two
[15:14] pieces
[15:15] he took off also their manner of Elijah
[15:18] they fell from him and went back and
[15:19] stood by the bank by Jordan the spirit
[15:23] of Elijah goes to the next one all right
[15:28] foreign
[15:45] Jordan with Christ
[15:47] we got one portion but when we returned
[15:50] we're coming with two portions we got
[15:53] eternal life restoration from sin now in
[15:56] Richardson with the Holy Ghost and then
[15:59] yeah
[16:00] on the return of Christ we come back
[16:03] with both physical restoration and we
[16:06] already got spiritual Resurrection we
[16:08] have a double portion of it always a
[16:10] type of Christ
[16:12] and the church
[16:14] Elijah and Elijah
[16:17] okay let's go to 17.
[16:21] 13.
[16:37] Second Kings 13 uh 20 to 21.
[16:44] and Elijah died and they buried him and
[16:47] the bands of a mobile and invade the
[16:49] land at the coming
[16:50] of the end of the year and he came to
[16:53] pass that they were bearing a man that
[16:54] behold
[16:56] they aspire to abandonment and they cast
[16:58] the man into Sepulcher of Elijah and
[17:01] when a man was left down and touched the
[17:03] bones of Elijah he revived and stood up
[17:06] on his feet
[17:08] another one that died
[17:14] okay let's go to uh
[17:15] brother Branham
[17:24] Malachi four five to six
[17:48] America four or five to six behold I
[17:52] will send you a lie to the prophet
[17:53] before they come and the great and
[17:55] Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall
[17:57] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[17:59] children
[18:00] and the Heart of the children to their
[18:02] fathers please that come and smite the
[18:05] Earth with a curse
[18:09] questions and answers brother I said all
[18:12] right remember yeah future now you could
[18:14] not have been the coming of John Deere
[18:16] with the Elijah but it comes five times
[18:18] now Jesus great Jesus Faith Grace five
[18:22] is a number of ways Elijah makes five
[18:25] appearance one time with Elijah as
[18:28] Elijah John Atlanta Magento and over
[18:31] emotion to the Jews

[21:01] was my idea of life so I said
[21:04] I couldn't stand that so I said

[21:14] I know
[21:16] you're numbness responsible for what you
[21:18] think
[21:19] um that just responsible for telling the
[21:21] truth and it started to strike that
[21:24] cigarette just as much determined to
[21:25] smoke it as I am to pick up the Bible
[21:28] see I heard that going
[21:31] I'll try it again I couldn't do it
[21:33] come out and I got crying I threw the
[21:36] thing down they got to laughing at me
[21:38] and I walked home went up through the
[21:40] field sat down and they're crying and it
[21:43] was a terrible life
[21:47] they offered me to uh they offered him
[21:50] the drink too and he said uh I remember
[21:53] one day dad was going down to the river
[21:55] with the boys my brother and I were we
[21:57] had to take a boat and go up down the
[22:00] river hunting bottles to put the whiskey
[22:02] in we got a nickel a dozen boy you get
[22:04] rich for that
[22:10] we picked them up along the river and
[22:12] dad was with me and he had one of those
[22:13] little flat I believe there was a better
[22:16] half half pint bottles and there was a
[22:18] tree had blown down in bed and this man
[22:21] was with me with him Mr darn Bush I had
[22:26] his he had a nice Bowl I wanted to find
[22:28] fail with him because I wanted to use
[22:30] that bowl he had a good Rudder and mine
[22:33] didn't have no Rudder at all we had just
[22:36] old boards and pedal with and he let me
[22:40] use the boat so we done well then and he
[22:44] made the Stills for death so he they
[22:47] throw their leg up across the tree and
[22:49] that reached in his back pocket and
[22:51] pulled out a little flat bottle of
[22:52] whiskey handed it to him and he took a
[22:55] drink and it back to Dad and he'd taken
[22:57] a drink and he said get down on a little
[23:00] supper on the side of the tree and went
[23:02] out and Mr Dawn Bush picked up and said
[23:04] here you are Billy
[23:06] said thank you I don't drink
[23:09] he said Brandon Madonna right everyone
[23:13] died with a boots on nearly and he said
[23:16] that random.com right
[23:18] I said no sir
[23:20] no that said I raised a again
[23:24] because
[23:26] my daddy called me and seriously I said
[23:28] hand me that bottle and pull this stop
[23:31] her out of the top of it they try not to
[23:33] drink it and when I started to turn it
[23:35] up
[23:37] I handed a bottle back and took off done
[23:39] through the field as hard as a good
[23:41] crime did something wouldn't let me do
[23:43] it see I could not say that
[23:45] that was any good I was determined to do
[23:48] it but it's God grace Amazing Grace that
[23:50] kept me from doing those things I wanted
[23:53] to defend myself but you just not let me
[23:56] do it
[23:59] I got so much stuff to do but if we're
[24:02] not going to be able to cover everything
[24:03] so
[24:09] a little bit
[24:18] we're probably not going to get to the
[24:20] two witnesses but a good thing I'd
[24:22] probably look at it
[24:25] page 324 Metro checkbook
[24:30] not only do we see this messenger coming
[24:33] here in Revelation 10 7 where we find
[24:36] that the word speaks of Elijah coming
[24:38] forward Jesus return in Matthew 17 10
[24:41] and the disciples asked him saying why
[24:44] then say describe that Elijah and my
[24:47] first come and Jesus said Elijah's truly
[24:49] is our first come and restore all things
[24:51] before the coming of Our Lord
[24:53] Elijah must come back for a work a
[24:56] restoration in the church this is
[24:57] Malachi 45 and 60 Hall I will send you
[25:01] Elijah the prophet before they come in
[25:03] at the Grateful day of the Lord
[25:07] we are the Lord he should turn their
[25:08] hearts our fathers to the children the
[25:10] heart of the children to the father at
[25:12] least they come and smite the Earth with
[25:13] a curse there's absolutely no doubt
[25:16] Elijah must return before the coming of
[25:19] Jesus as the Pacific work to accomplish
[25:21] that work is
[25:24] that word is part of Malachi or sick
[25:27] that says he will he will turn a horse
[25:29] at the children to their father the
[25:31] reason that we know this in the specific
[25:34] work to do at this time because he is
[25:37] already accomplished the part that says
[25:39] he should turn the hearts of the father
[25:41] to their children
[25:43] when the Elijah Ministry was here in
[25:45] John that Baptist Luke 1 17 and he shall
[25:49] go before him in a spirit of Elijah to
[25:51] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[25:54] children the disobedient to the wisdom
[25:56] or just to make ready people prepare for
[25:59] the Lord and the ministry of John the
[26:02] horse of the father returned to the
[26:03] children we know that because Jesus said
[26:06] so
[26:06] but it does not say that the hearts of
[26:09] the children were turned to the father
[26:10] that is yet to take place the heart of
[26:14] the less they children will be returned
[26:16] back to the Pentecostal father
[26:19] John got the fathers ready for Jesus to
[26:22] welcome the children into the fall
[26:24] novice Prophet upon the spirit of Elijah
[26:28] Paul will prepare the children to
[26:30] welcome back Jesus
[26:34] we don't have time but uh
[26:37] everybody is expecting for brother
[26:39] Robert to come back but just like the
[26:42] Chinese Laundry tickets
[26:49] I looked over and
[26:53] I
[26:58] thank you
