the bible study will be this this coming saturday only now because of the wedding that jacob and them had and i'm sure that they're uh you know well on their way in and going and doing and handing

you lord for your love and your grace we thank you for the day and the time that we have thank you for you lord and we pray that you would just bless us now with your presence and your understanding forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us from all unrighteousness may our hearts and minds be set on you lord as we speak and may we be able to lord administer thy word to your people that you may be able to quicken it into each one of our hearts and lives forgive our sins most of all because we want to stand complete in you have your way now in jesus name bless sister win there lord let everything be all right in jesus name amen revelations one the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servant things which must shortly come to christ and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they they hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand all right revelations six verse seven and eight and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that set on him was death and hell followed him power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beast of the earth he may be seated the lord is blessing to the reading of the word now i want to try to uh finish up on this fourth seal if we can today and move on to the fifth and all going on trying to but we'll see how it works out so just remember that we've spent a lot of time proving over the periods of time that you know for 40 something years we've been talking about it that the actual happening under the seals as far as the things taking place when it's brought to a finality is really brought over into a period of time after the rapture of the church the bride goes up in revelations 4 1 and not seen until 1921 and that's coming back with jesus christ so then believing it then it's not in our day is we proved it over and over paragraph 194 we won't pull these up yet brother anderson but we'll start probably about the number we'll start on number four with you with your notes save him some time of pulling up but anyhow it's not in our day this is the time of the the prophet as he said on paragraph 194 there this is not in our day but it's the seal foretold amen the seal foretold now an example of that is taken in acts uh there in the scriptures where it says acts 3 and 24 yea and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days now all the way through the bible it's been a foretelling or a getting forth first you know bringing it forward letting us know what to expect and what to be and and where we're at and that way then the prophet in this day would be telling us what because he says our paragraph 194 this is the seal foretold in other words for telling us what these things are going to be that even though we're not going to be there it's going to be something that will be passed to us but we can see what leads up to it i've tried to get you to see those things you know like the white horse rider starting in genesis and riding through the red horsemen when kane killed an abort writing through the bible black horse coming through the darkness and the horrible things that are there and coming out to this pale horse which would be death you know and coming forth in our day and it you we can see it unfold our foretold right that's the title more of the message of the fourth seal foretold all right and as it's doing it's letting us know because we're seeing that the seals reveal what has been what it is and what will be you know all right then it's a revelation of jesus christ because he's the same yesterday today and forever and satan's not so we're trying to reveal jesus christ right through the opening of the word is what the purpose of doing and by doing that then it is exposing satan and his right and his doings and and the things that he's been been you know uh doing down through the time so then the word foretold is to show before foretell have noticed before or listen to this one to announce before that a thing will be of prophecies pre-announcement in the sense of to promise all right foretold now so we see that it's foretold unto us the things that would happen by looking back through the bible right and seeing as it unfolds down through and these seals coming down but then the actual part of the seal that's really the finish is armageddon as we'll get to it a little bit which is in the tribulation period and we certainly don't go there until we go on a rapture but now it's going to be interesting a little bit because we're going to cover this on a two-fold thing and we'll lay down just a little background and we'll see that that we've actually we can see it unfolding because there's actually a spiritual battle of armageddon going on right now the literal battle will be in the tribulation after we get out of here but there's a spiritual battle which is in our minds and that was what i was trying to bring this morning right to point c to to deal with satan he's bombarding these our minds he he's bringing it to a place and and you know and sometimes i mean i have to admit it i hope you do that sometimes he bombards my mind so much so i can't even think straight you know i mean i can't can't do it i have to stop and pray and say now satan get out of here you know just everything's coming in even even if it wouldn't be bad but you know if he can't get you to think bad thoughts he'll just get you to like good thoughts you know you know her plan things or do something right anything to entertain your mind and that was what i was trying to get across this morning to see that's what is death and sickly is that satan has the ability to work through our minds and to cause us to think wrong causes us to get all muddled up in the world and he's trying to keep us entertained well the way it used to be you know when we was kids we didn't have entertainment i mean you you you could you could take a a nail and a stick and drive it together and make a little wheel and run out through the yard and go and make your car or we even made our own wagons out the wheels and everything you know bore a burna hole through them with a with a rod of iron you know and make a wagon and drive it and all kinds of things but see the kids now everything is entertaining you know in school even now you computers everybody's got to be computer you know something about you your your schooling is all tied to it you've got to see this you got to do that you've got to be entertained because that's the world and like i've always said to you i read this one time they say that the reason they're doing it now in the movie industry that your mind only runs so many minutes and keeps pretty well attention so then what you have to do is it runs so long and then it kind of starts dwindling down so you'll notice your your fast action movies they're changing that scene continually because that's keeping your minds and keeping you related to it and controlling you well see that's what satan is trying to do around the world to all of us he's giving you things to do right right never have any time i'm looking like her i hope janet's life is because of some of it but i look back there and i think about boyd i've heard him tell you know so she'll get in the bed two or three in the morning now she gets to working all of doing everything you know because it's entertaining it's the world is controlling us you got so many things going on well that's satan's tactic that's right maybe sometimes we need to just sit down and put a real brain on idol you know and just relax a little bit and get away from it all to to be able to uh exist but then when you try to get away from it all what is it all comes with you the biggest problem okay but now this this something foretold god has been unveiling this secret mystery to his bride and that's why the prophet had to be sent as we were bringing this morning that the eagle is the one that calls him death we'll see he said on the first seal he said he's been death all the whole time but see even into him he didn't know it because before the seals would break it he'd come forth in the field and he said i didn't know why i was against that but now i see why and actually because it began to unfold to him to see what death really is and death is not just a dying factor it's a it's a fact sometimes of even living in life because we're a dying generation we're dying people what what's wrong with the world today is there's no more push right to go and do why because we went to the moon we went into the planet see we we run rockets all out into space and there's not a lot to be accomplished right it's already been done so that just puts us in a kind of slow down pace and that becomes deadly because if your enemy's not into something but that's when he begins to to attack you but i i hope that was getting across this morning but but just think about it we as the bride of christ can look back right and see god unfolding this yes and allowing us to be able to see it and then seeing things like if we'll get to it in a minute and we have to see it in like compound meanings you know like satan being kicked out of heaven was he was kicked out in the beginning but yet he's still in heaven so when you come over to revelations 12 he's kicked out again well that's because the bride is went up right in a rapture it's because he'll be kicked out right right see if we can't win this battle over death now that's the whole message this evening if you and i the whole message for all of my life will do it if you and i and i believe you and i are the end time people i believe i'm looking at the end time people i don't i'm not looking for or more generations to come but yet if they have to come then that's fine but i'm looking at the basis of saying well i believe we're winding it down it's coming to an end and if it's coming to an end then you know there's a great battle going on read the message a prophet called the greatest battle ever fought amen he said satan chose man's mind all right god chose his heart and see because of that mind this is all muddled up and everything going but then when god speaks in the heart it just solves all the rest of it right right see that's where revelation is at revelation is not in your head right it has to come through the head but the revelation is in the heart where the word is revealed to us and then that way you know it's finished but if we can't win the battle over death then there's no hope for israel to do it that's right no no i don't mean this wrong about them the 144 000 but there will not be the bride right we've been through that right sure they will be the people of god sure they'll receive uh the baptism of the holy ghost they'll have eternal life the other 144 000 yeah but they still won't be the bride so that means the battle is for you and i it's for us to defeat satan all right see then when we defeat satan people when it goes there they'll be able to handle him right they'll be able to conquer him but you and i got to conquer the battle of the mind you know our thoughts and things but but brother dale you're always going off on the preachers in this message they're wonderful i'll agree with you no problems we see goodness is not what's counting today it's whether or not it's the word you remember that's what we ended up this morning death cannot conquer the revealed word there's no way satan can't defeat that word once it's made known to you you can just stand on it and say forget it i don't understand it but i believe it it's a finished product that's right because god has revealed it to you and i all right so then in doing that you can see that what's taking place now right is the most important battle of the entire bible all right that's right you know the bible speaks about those prior to us it says day without us and not make perfect right right but i'm i'm trying to tell you those in the future the 141 000 the thing that there's no hopes if we can't win this battle right and it's a battle over the human mind right because if he can get into that mind and pervert this word it's well so hard against you know people saying things and all right because of this what does it do to people heard a man just recently say that the boy was quoting scripture of it but he said that we have you know a covering for past sins we have a covering for sins we repent for present he said we even have a covering for future sins well that sounds good right that sounds good and he's giving scriptures but i can't help but think that that's exactly the catholic church and what they do right right sure i know the blood of jesus christ atones for all sin yet but if we don't repent amen that's right come on we're gonna have to give an account somewhere come on if that ain't the message come show me all right i thought before sins were remitted then i had to repent if not why not we just forget we just get there by the world we just do it's gift everybody no no i thought repentance is what came and brought the forgiveness of sins right amen i didn't know that i had a future you know covering of my sins all right amen i thought i had to repent well i mean i can't ever be that when i hear it and i'm listening two or three hundred people they're sitting there amen you know i can't get what it does in my heart right well the brother didn't mean all i know is what he's saying that's right all right i ain't capable of understanding what he meant but evidently he meant what he said because he said it three times you know we got a covering for future sins no now go to another one there goes a brother dale becoming arrogant and hateful that's all right i'm sorry but i'm fighting for your soul right in my soul i'm in the greatest battle that has ever been fought and it is in my human mind right well what you need to do you need to get it straightened up and cleaned out that's what i'm trying to do okay i'm trying to do that right but it surely don't work out to bring me false doctrine right and we're talking about the city weeks of daniel see they were talking about progressive revelation progressive revelations not corrective revelation corrective revelation was where brother around was wrong and god corrected it progressive revelation is where brother brown was right but yet there was things that not unfolded to him at that time and it become progressive right but it sounds real good to the human mind but think it over right that's why i'm kind of strong myself i want you to think about what i'm saying right it don't bother me because you don't amen it doesn't because you're thinking are you asleep the doctor told piggy went down or somebody did about it because it wasn't your body heals when you're asleep more than it does when you weigh so if nothing else maybe i've got a healing factor about preaching and you go to sleep and god will heal you okay get your life we're gonna move on all right but now listen the greatest battle ever fought that's right one day will be fought all right now armageddon right all right now that's what i want you to do because i'm going to read in a minute i'm going to read about four pages out of the seal book in continual reading until you you go home and you read it in things but show me anywhere in that fourth seal or even later that brother branham referring to the battle of armageddon that he mentions russia china india or any of those countries i remember we were down to athens years ago and his brother he preached on armageddon he boy he was going with it you know russia coming down here and there's people coming here in this group and after the service brother mo asked him a question said where did brother ryan say them forces come from he said i don't really know but see he was preaching supposed to be the message of the hour telling us what the prophet had to say i'm just asking you to do it read the fourth seal read the field wrong and see if he's telling you about a battle of russia china india this that or the other coming now now we know they will right but he calls them protestants and catholics that's the forces right god looks down we look at as russia coming this way china coming this way you know where we are we're right over here with them you know we're compassionate about jerusalem now all of us are but we all need that minerals and the things that they've got there right but see when god looks down he sees protesters and catholics because every nation in the world today whether it be russia china india whatever they have a religious atmosphere about them right and they're in one category the other protestants are catholics he said well what about all these muslims and all these things you probably find out one of these days it's all controlled by the same fellas they're saying this morning amen when the big head man steps up there is that beast satan incarnate the world will bow in his knees i don't care what country it is i don't care if there are countries that would fight the catholics to death when you tell a man straighten up or we cut off all of your you're all in your things because i can do it amen a country is going to give in right right right because what can they do oh we'll just stand alone that's not it do you understand what my point is the battle of armageddon when it happens in the tribulation period we're done gone when that literal battle takes place all right that's when satan breaks his covenant you know he's got a covenant there and he breaks it in the middle of that last week he breaks that covenant and when he breaks that covenant he stands in the temple of god showing himself to be as god he got control of everybody and how can they argue with it see then it will be a russia coming down with china coming down the people gathering around because they're already right there we are on our own part of it they're on their side but when god looks down he calls it protestants and catholics right i want you to get the point from the seal because it's foretold all the way from genesis to show you that that's that spirit the antichrist coming down until it controls mankind and if it gets controlled then you'll start tightening the strings as we call it until he brings it to the place it will bow down on earth now you say oh but god will be with us god will only be with the bride right right he's not fighting for the world that's right he'll only be in the battle of armageddon in the literal you'll only be with 144 000. right right you won't be with israel as a nation sorry you won't be amen all right see it's a battle battling the human mind you know how the human mind works how can you see people or somebody on the internet especially anyway i've seen that guy put a call drop in his mouth he must not be too good of a preacher but you make up your choice for what it is i don't have to worry about it i just know if i don't put it in there i'm not gonna be able to finish the message well if you had what you think you got i've never said i had anything right i just know what god has got don't worry about the rest of it that's right that's what you're thinking so your mind gets in there so just in case somebody out there hears it that way you just seen you got cut off all right but now let's get on with it we can look back and see ever you know that brother ryan said every denomination was in genesis he said all these doctrines that you have come from genesis that was your seals were told you know leading up to look at all of the battles that's being of mankind right leading up to a drastic battle you know what armageddon means termination of forces that's the interpretation of the word armageddon all right you see it it's never been terminated before right hand that's right but one day there will be a termination of forces when god comes down and ends that battle that's right and see that's where the people of the message get into it look so beautiful and it it it is hard to divide it takes a revelation right because they say well look here brother adam preached the whole fourth seal about you and i yeah sure because that's the main battle as i was saying a moment ago the main battle is right here now whether a bride can overcome satan's tactics in his way and if we don't there is no battle for nobody else that's right literal battles don't mean a thing to god one word and he destroys it all right right that's what i showed one time jordan to a bunch of ministers when we're talking about armageddon and i said who do you think on firearm again well first of all we're gonna ride back with him and we're going to whoop him people you know we're going to wipe them off you better remember we're coming back into the millennium right i'd like for you to show me where we're coming back before the millennium right there because if we're coming back here before the millennium you've got a problem right right but if we're coming back in the millennium then you can see the truth and see by doing it then what i've done i draw it out for some brothers one time because it asked me the question who's fought in the battle of armageddon i said well okay now we got russia we got china we got india we draw all them out and i said all that's the bad guys you know and i said where's the good guys in so we got they're all gathered around israel you know the land of israel jerusalem the land they're gathered around it but remember now that all of israel except 144 thousand is in a covenant with the antichrist right so then i took israel out just took it off the board you know i said because they're the enemy bad guy too right so you got to put them on the side of the bad guys that are gathered around because 144 000 is not going to be killed by russian soldiers they're going to be killed by israeli people because of their stand for the truth listen we'll go ahead i need 144 000. well that'd be great with 144 000 against 7 billion yeah we're going to have to be pretty good fighters it ain't being silly that's just being truthful well then i said okay according to the bible 144 000 are killed before armageddon literally takes place so i just raced out 144 thousand and boy we getting down to some pretty good fighting bill if you think now we got two people against seven billion and i said oh according to the bible the two prophets are killed so erase them out yup i said who's fighting come on accessible i just done a calculation for you or what you call those big words you know to be able to understand it i said what's going to bring armageddon is them two prophets when they stand there with that word that word out of their mouth bring down the plagues up on the earth it don't matter whether they're alive or dead that don't have nothing to do with it you know that this prophet's message the prophet's been gone 40 years and you know what's bringing down these things on the world amen the message he preached 40 years ago in past amen right it's causing because that's what the bible says that's the truth the bible says we're compassed it's watching us fight this battle and we're in that battle part of it but we're not over there in a literal happening right does everybody understand what i'm saying where we can approach it right yes we're not there at the literal battle of armageddon but we are in a spiritual battle a battle of the mind amen that satan has controlled everything right he glide his way right through it and brought it up now let's start with number four and we'll just start from here but that's the basis now somebody on the internet hearing me somebody don't take hearing me please listen to the first part and listen to what i'm saying we're not going to be there in the battle of armageddon but we are in a spiritual battle amen that's taking place today and if we don't win this battle right now and i don't mean win it like we win it that's right brother right no we don't win nothing god don't need you and me whether you like it or not you know well you might find it out we can't do without him you probably said he can put us away anytime he wants to but said you better not try to put him away you want to bring death and finish the whole thing all right so then as we start it now go ahead with number four brother and we'll because we're going into the scriptures is what i want to bring up and what we're talking about because remember we go up in revelation 4 1. right now watch what it says this is taken from the first seal paragraph 361 then in revelation 12 9 12 729 when satan has cast out the accuser you want to put that down because i want to read it we haven't got time now because it's 15-10 but in revelations 12 where they got that word from queen i ain't never heard that you bad my english is and i've never even known that one but in revelations 12 7 through 9 satan the spirit the devil which is up there now accuser of our brethren all right the church is taken up right and satan is cast out then the church when the church goes up satan comes down i love that because we're not gonna be up there together he ain't gonna allow that that's ended we win this battle there ain't no place for him up there this is the people that's gonna put him out of heaven if you understand what i'm saying the prophet's emphasizing we go up he comes out the reason he can't stay is because we're gonna be there that's what he thinks of us then satan incarnates himself in the antichrist and called the beast all right so look at the scripture now revelations 12. and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven with their t-h-e-r their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him all right now compound right that was in the beginning that was in the beginning that satan was cast out of heaven right back before time started right the angels and the things were cast out right michael and and lucifer fought it out right and he was cast out all right man now come down to a spiritual all right in time and we go up and he's going to be cast out what about they won't even have a place is that what we're saying is that what the bible said neither was their place found anymore in heaven from that day on satan won't be able to enter heaven to accuse you right he's defeated that's right church if you understand what i mean we're the ones going to defeat it amen right right it's not going to be army's fighting that's why your prod the prophet called it protestants and catholics we'll be down to that but he's cast out there's no place no more why because the bride when she goes up he goes that comes down all right so let's see what happens when this happens and we've read these so paragraph 190 go ahead number six and he becomes an antichrist now it couldn't be antichrist on his spirit didn't he become an antichrist and that spirit took a man that taught the same things that the antichrist spirit was doing and then he become a false prophet to the antichrist spirit now what about when a man in an organization suit yourself i don't know what you think about it but all right that's how blunt the prophet could be what about somebody who would stay in an organization and wouldn't follow the truth okay now finally he becomes a beast now wait we'll get into that in a after a little while after a while see all right now if satan's trinity lays like that satan all the time satan antichrist spirit and christ spirit incarnate false prophet then becomes the beast the when not a demon that was in that antichrist but when satan himself is kicked out he comes down when he becomes incarnate in that man he's kicked out right he takes over the place where the demon was that we were talking a lot ago something about the you say well how does that work all right how does god work remember satan's gonna top ice cream right not a type of top ice cream that's right jesus christ was standing on earth that body wasn't god right that body was a creation but inside of that body dwelt almighty god incarnate right incarnate in a body that was born for that purpose but see satan can't do that he can't create a body to step into it so he has to borrow one like he did he barred the beast in the garden to start the whole thing to go in now he becomes incarnate as the beast in other words that man has become so much to that until that man no longer has anything of his own you ever seen people that were so demon-possessed of things yeah what about adolf hitler that was going to conquer the world and he wasn't even satan incarnate he just wanted a blonde race of people to rule the world you know kind of hard he's hated you anyway but must have been fighting against his own self but now listen satan being kicked out of heaven now we've read this next quote so much until let's just pull them up to the scriptures going up brother to number eight satan being kicked out of heaven revelations 13 1-8 he is incarnate in the person of the beast all right revelations 13. now step on the sound of the sea and saw beast ride up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns upon his heads the name of blasphemy now get the point seal for toad a lot of this was way back under that's your ten kingdoms of daniel right the ten toes and the things still coming down to the end and the beach which i saw was like into a leopard and his feet wears his feet of a bar and his mouth is a mouth of line and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority now watch him and i saw one of his heads that were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered at the beast we'll read on the next quote when we get to it just a minute but around said that's when pagan rome became palpatrone that's your wound that was under death pagan rome was destroyed the roman people you know the government the things it was finally destroyed and as it was destroyed it became powerful rome to control so you're looking way back to see something foretold you're looking back to the ten kingdoms of daniel to see something foretold for what's going to take place and they worship the dragon which gave power to the beast and they worship the beast saying who is unto the beast who is able to make war with him now i thought that we believed that the united states was the image to the beast right 13 13 13. i thought we believed that's the way the prophet expressed it so when pagan wrong became papal wrong was when your wound was given to him he got a deadly wound the natural government of rome was destroyed you come over into the papal rome peru now it's not ruling just italy it's ruling the world all right and where are we at going up to the next part everything because that's just part of the scripture that i was given unto him in my house speaking great things and blasphemies and powers given unto him to continue 40 in two months yep that's your tribulation see we're the image to the beast nobody can make war against this man in his armies you look at it right now we're trying to police the world and you know we can do it because we have the firepower to destroy a nation that doesn't agree with us that's why we're the image to the beast we're trying now to control the world right who is it why is it that when something comes up that we were supposed to send these uh u.n troops into a place but we're there by way before the u.n troops that ever brought in right because we are the ones with the power the image to the beast right right and he opened his mouth and great blasphemous and and blasphemed his name and his tabernacle and then that dwell in heaven okay because he's cast out sending their blacks demon because he'd been cast out and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power given unto them of all kindreds and tongues and nations now you tell me i wasn't right this morning you tell me i'm not right now and saying that every government in the world the prophet said it's controlled by the devil do you think they won't all do his bidding i don't care if it's a far country that don't even hardly where was the other day i heard the other day somebody telling it and it might have been over the other night talking about some country or wherever they that the first time they never had that electric lights in that country but that country is controlled by the devil right ain't even got no electrolytes miscontrolled by the devil all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life on the lamb slain before the foundational world you say i tell you what so i won't never worship according to the bible if we don't make the rapture we definitely got a problem because we're going to be hunted down and killed because even the foolish virgin is going to be hunted down and killed during the tribulation they'll have to give their life on what they believe are we willing to give out okay let's see if the prophet was writing go ahead with number 10. well we're not our denomination progress 69 it's all about the kings five kings and all from the history i'll show you now watch the beast now the beast wasn't a king he was one which is which is not and yet he is and is not and yet he is and is not what is he succession of popes right a power of beast ruling that's when pagan rome was converted to make power wrong pagan rome was converted and then it become the papacy which they had a pope in the state of a king and the pope is the spiritual king that's the reason he's a crown spiritual king claims to be the backer of jesus christ that's who the folk claims to be instead of instead of jesus christ all right go to the next this is taken from the fourth seal of 175 and it never did become that way in rome and he's giving you powers over all the nations that's in revelation right we just got to read it never did become that way in rome until pagan rome was converted into papua rome and the catholic power spread the world made the universal catholic church all right are you seeing it yeah now go to one program 195 excuse me 194 number 12 number number 12. watch what he says now the fourth seal we read this over and over watch rides a pale horse as he appears in his right he's right this last ride he's on his life's his lice now now this is not in our day that will be on down it's the seal foretold because see the church has done gone up when this happens okay now now the battle of armageddon as i said let's start reading in a hurry he said it was the seal of fort cold before it ever takes place right this battle of armageddon started in the garden of eden in the human mind i don't have time to bring all of it to do you're to know it read the greatest battle ever fought and you'll find it what i'm saying the battle began in the garden in the mind of man and he's been battling ever since as a matter of fact this battle began in heaven when satan his angels was cast out so now i covered what are talking about a while ago the compound meaning of revelations were the casting out of the red dragon it was back there before the foundational world now it's done when the bride goes up will be cast out again no place will ever be found for him anymore in heaven he finds his place the lake of fire the beast and the false prophet to show you what god thinks now think with me a second man is to be judged before he goes to perth to hell right but you know the bible says the beast and the false prophet is casting the lack of fire and it doesn't mention giving them a judgment come on preach your bible read your prophet it doesn't say that they go to the white throne they're just cast i didn't know why because they're incarnate there's no need of judging them what would you judge them for they are the devil false prophet and him is both cast in there it says the beast and the false prophet what's a false prophet was the body human part element of the beast that's dwelling within that hope you don't even have to be judged because he doesn't cast out of heaven all right so let's get started on it now paragraph 278 number 13. these will all be from the fourth seal except the last one and then i'll go where i'll get to that or not paragraph 278 now there'll be a couple of little jumps and then you're going to start reading the solid all the way through what is all this coming to we just got about 12 14 minutes here i guess look what this is all coming to now keep in mind spiritual battle finishing with a literal battle you'll see why brother brown didn't bring russia and china down because when they come down they're going to be protestants and catholic because we went into every country in the world with our our protestants and catholics now what is it it's going right back to the way it did it started in heaven it's coming to the end time battle the first thing in heaven was a battle lucifer was kicked out and come to earth and then he polluted eden then he's been polluting ever since and now from the battle in heaven it's coming to the battle on earth and it's to be fulfilled that on earth at the end time in a battle called armageddon now anyone knows that the battle started in heaven holy oh and so they kicked them out michael and his angels overthrowed them just run out and when they did drop right down in eden and here started the battle down here right at number 14. this is jumping like a couple of paragraphs to this same time of reading paragraph 286 85 excuse me now the battle started in heaven to be finished on earth in the form of armageddon now let's watch and see it unfold right unfold this armageddon that's going to be over there after we leave out of here is going to unfold to you and i that we can see what's taking place maybe we can unfold it and the lord helps us right now to do this watch it unfold the mysterious writer watch what he does now opposed refuse to repent and go back to the original blood word the word became blood and flesh see he refused to go back to it his antichrist the true word bride is the he's opposed to the true word bride takes his own bride he opposes this true bride too and he takes his own bride and brings her in in the form of religion called creeds and dogma see and now seeing the holy bride is against her but he forms his own bride called antichrist by antichrist teaching which is contrary to christ see how shrewd he is and now instead of having a unity of love and controlling worship under blood he's got a denomination instead of having the word he took creeds and dogmas and so forth number 15. dumpty burger 299. what's gathered then now on this mixed-colored horse he's getting them together on his mixed colored oars oh you've got political political powers if you don't believe he has how did this president get in just now that was john f kennedy right brought in by the fraud of the machine that they voted for the wrong person right how did you get him in look what he says about it how did you ever slip up as the last time i voted for a presidential election and i will not vote again right why because why are you vote when you're just giving up your right my one vote ain't going to change a whole lot how did they ever slip up come over here for freedom of religion and you bunch of democrats that would sell your birth right out to politics i was a democrat right and what happened sold out my birthright i ain't got democratic parties they're both rotten i'm talking about christianity but you sell your birth rights on a democratic ticket to put something like that in shame on you now you know that'd be nice to say that to the world today but number 16. together them on their mixed colored horses it's going to be continual reading from now on for a while he's gathered this thing together mixed with greek denominations man-made doctrines where's russia china and india and all of these countries don't you read them in here stop me somewhere and tell me about it is that right you're a mixed-colored the mixed color of the dead pale horse of the world now that's right mixed colors of the dead worldly form of the pale horse oh my no holy blood of the word at all and watch from the front corner from the four corners of the earth they gather them gathers them to armageddon who's together protestants and captains he's not gathering russian china that's going to be there because of the natural whatever country is going to be there going to have religious people in it they do right now the bible said i'm trying to think of the scripture i got them wrote down here i ain't calling them but just where they were written down see what they are gathers them together to the great day of the battle of the lord god he says watch go ahead because next all he's got to do is keep pushing his fingers now cause this is continual reading out of the seal book you read it paragraph 307 this will be from 307 to 328 i think it is now on this mixed colored world it felt sick horse just think of it you know that's a bad thing now watch where he gathers them from the four corners of the earth they are gathering now for the showdown the showdown will be at armagedding according to the word see on the pale horse riding on it with death tact with the name tacked on him death the antichrist listen antichrist first denomination that can't be spirit without with his can't be spirit with his jezebel the prostitute to the word with her daughters with her protestants gathering themselves together now in unity what's he saying did you hear the baptist people speaking the other day over here you know we won't join up with them but we'll we'll be friendly as of the lifestyle note of it the catholic church is not a member of the world council of churches that's the last i heard it may be now because it had delegates there for many many it's been 40 50 years ago they had delegates there they are not a member of the world council of churches why daniel says they come in by flattery right battery means you invite the guy in you got to get the guy in that's got control right okay well we'll we'll be friendly and kind of click with them we won't have to join their church but there you are now you are just exactly what the word said here sees the old harlot in the first place see i heard about a year or two ago that they were talking about who would represent us if it were council of churches they tried to join it and they were talking about somewhere overseas some people were talking about getting us into world council churches who's going to represent us right now here they are joining themselves together coming to the showdown in armageddon and riding on a mixed colored horse with one horse and white one horse of red one horse are black three different political a political power spiritual power controlled by demon power which is the antichrist mixing that all together you got a sickly looking thing that he's riding on that's right now notice look what he's riding on this pale looking grizzly colored horse mixed with black red and white coming into the battle gathering his subjects remember nation under heaven much do not daniel interpret the dream and sing that streak of iron running to every kingdom of king of rome here they come gathering now sit still for a close just a minute and listen close they're gathering in now to do it bringing his subjects from the four corners of the earth riding a pale cyclic three colored mixed horse same man now revelation 19 not only is he gathering no notice he getting ready but christ is getting ready to meet him now watch this next little bit and you'll see the battle is going to be hot and heavy christ's in revelation 19. christ is not from the four corners of the earth because there's going to be a little bitty remnant there's that little bitty hundred forty four thousand left two witnesses left so the literal battle is over there and that's why it's gonna be a little bitty fear not little flock bride that will stand this battle of armageddon spiritually speaking and we'll be able to take the pressures and the things and be able to walk out and believe god's word what's he doing he's getting them from the four corners of heaven that's where god's getting hit from we'll get them sold and under the altar tomorrow night and you'll see whether it's right or not four corners of hell and on the snow white horse he also has a name not death but the word of god life amen god it wrote right on his toe there here the word of god that's the only life because god is the only source of eternal life there is nobody is that right you've got rogue life riding on a white horse okay so the the revolution is 19 even though it's going to happen over there it's got a spiritual happening over here the battle's right right now this is what he's saying it's going on right now see we're not going over to revelation 19 as i've said over and over and over caught it for 40 something years we're not coming down with a sword but we're going to we're going we're going to come down here and we're going to ride on them white horses and we're going to have a sword well they got tanks they got to add them bombs they got all kind of things i want at least a bb gun just showing you how people people are stealing this the way they think because that's what preachers just makes you think they say i i thought we're going to come back and fight a battle if we win this battle the battle's over right all right now let's get back to where we're at he's gathering his what he's got wrote life with a white horse and here's a man with three different powers mixed up called in gathering his earthbound delegates and christ is gathering his heaven-born subjects saints he's got death wrote on him because it's got right life wrote on him those with him won't buy horses also and they're called the chosen before the foundational world amen they're faithful to the word amen we i like that one called chosen before the foundational world and then faithful to the word of their choosing all stimulated with new wine and oil just riding right along coming down to meet him they know the thunders will issue the thing of course pretty soon who's he talking about who knows the thunders is going to issue this lord other than you and i who knows the thunders has the complete revelation of jesus christ other than you and i the bride so we know the thunders are going to issue it forth right right but just remember if we don't win this battle there won't be no victorious right into the millennium right when we come back on the white horses with him we're going into the millennium that's according to your prophet right and he thanks so much of us on daniel 70 weeks he said we are the anointing to the temple that will be built in the millennium right read you daniel sydney williams but listen and watch how he does it he is the word and his name is the word then the word is life antichrist anything advertise against to antis against the christ the word so it's gotta be creed our denomination which is against the word i don't see how you're going to miss it do you understand how could you miss it i don't know how you're going to but that's true after crisis against isn't that right take away from that's what he was he's riding his mixed up horse we see it right in here in the word of god right here in the word of god we see it right there in the seven churches ages here he brings it right back in the seals opening up and showing them things that went on in the church ages and times against the word the why creates why we're so against the creeds and denominations because they're against the word all right here we see life and death coming to the final struggle that's in me and you the white horse of true life the pale horse of mixed creed you see the thing coming to a real showdown now i want you i want to say something here you might not believe this but i looked it up to be sure there's only one original color and that's why i mean he knows that there's only one original color anything else is mixed christ is on a solid white unadulterated word from the beginning amen every color would be white if some chemistry hadn't broke into it amen glory every church would be standing on the apostolic doctrine of the word of god and god confirming it to be confirming it if he didn't have creeds and denominations mixed into it now you are well brother evans i feel good right now yes sir yes sir only the original color that's why it never it never mixed with denominations or creeds no sir and remember his sights are clothed in white robes not mixed with denominations of creeds then we find out the denomination creep here's where you get your mixed color because this is the original color he's writing the original colors on his people and they've been dipped into blood that cleanse the garment and send it right back under see that's that's right those mixed those that mixed turn pale and go to death it's a perverting per perversion to mix colors with white you pervert the original color is that right if the original color only color is white and you mix something with it you pervert it to real cause amen is that right and when if he is the white horse and he is the word didn't mix anything with that any kind of a creed add one word to it take one word away from it it's to pervert the whole thing oh my keep me with the word lord truth and error oh my no matter how good is it truth and era cannot mix now listen to it it cannot mix it's either the dust set the lord or it's wrong no matter what holy father said saint benefits are are the archbishops of canterbury i don't know who said it if it's contrary to the word it's perversion it won't mix and what and somebody evidently put a thought up watch him say this fella done i don't care what he's done how much you holy he is or anything like that this is the only direct truth that we have no church no creed has no creed has no truth if it's outside of this show me one that's got it i want you to tell me i'll turn a page in the bible and show you something so he said just call the one you said pentecost oh my i just caught that thought from somebody better leave it alone right now because i've seen that start at the sore spot right there i didn't didn't want to hurt you but i just wanted you to know i know what you were thinking about see the word was hard to turn it out right those that's mixed turn the antichrist to death see those that mix turn the antichrist anti-deposit turns the death color when you mix any kind of anything with the original it's like christ said about the mustard seed it's the smallest of all seed but it won't mix with nothing mustard won't mix genuine mustard so if you just got that much of faith just hold to it notice life followed him riding on my horses it was a word life vindicated by his resurrected saints now when we come riding back in the millennium we are going to be the resurrected saints not coming in the millennium get resurrected we just went to a marriage supper and coming back vindicated by his resurrection and sanctioned with him how's the battle going to go jesus said he that believeth in me though he were dead he actually lived do you believe in me though you you were dead you shall live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die again he said he that believes in me he will give him eternal life raise him up at the last days that's the promised scripture much here comes satan with all four corners of the earth with his protestants never anything about russia yet and with his catholics and all together marching right up to the battle of armageddon all right and here comes jesus down from heaven with resurrected saints vindicated word now i could put a point right in there where do you think about it you know this battle that's going on now in the bride of christ you know those is in heaven know about and it they come they're coming to our aid not physically speaking right right they don't have to come here to do it we meet them in the air so don't worry about it resurrected saints they know it's going to issue it forth pretty soon we're gathered about by the bible says a great cloud of witnesses and you know in the scripture there the prophet used how long how long as the bride of christ but when you say how long how long to avenge our blood that was israel so you can say how long how long they're saying right now how long how long they're saying right now come on church right we're ready the resurrection's coming all right just drop that little bit in as i said if god speaks and sends you he he backs what you say he said notice if you're an ambassador from heaven all heaven is behind you and all heaven is consistent of the word i love that notice now he's coming with resurrected saints vindicating his word is true for satan knows then the bottomless pit is ready for him oh my while death robbed a pale horse mixed creed and denominations and followed him oh my the eternal separation from god that's where the word he rode them to to eternal separation that's what the antichrist has done christ wrote his church right into glory in the resurrection battle of armageddon spiritually speaking is taking place now right the battle in your mind satan is trying to pervert it or either keep it entertained to try to keep us up from believing god's word he's doing everything he can look at him now as he's using the preacher's so-called of this message that some will say brother branham was wrong some will say he done this wrong he done that wrong trying to destroy your confidence in the message of the hour there's your spiritual battle of armageddon right and they will be a physical one in the tribulation after we leave out of here amen but it'll be because we won this battle before death right the death can't get me until god is through with me i don't worry about it he may cause me a lot of problems a lot of struggles a lot of heartaches a lot of hurting and wounds and things but he can't get me until god is suing me man i'd like to be there to see this change come on all right but where did brother mention armageddon anywhere about physical forces shooting guns and weapons he never mentioned anything about russia and them and their great bombs and us with our great bombs he said protestants and cabinets as i said when we went to war in world war one both sides was on a lot of degree called christians world war ii look at where you gathered it around the world you brothers that was ever in service you would know maybe i don't know what to do now with it but back then you had a dog tag you know what it said on there you were either a protestant or a catholic do they still put it on her now i don't even know and i know they did then because it was protestants and catholics he was either one of the two because they wanted to know who to pray for you if you got blown away you know that's right so you had to put down you was either protestant or catholic there's where your forces is coming russia today you've got a lot of christians in it there's even believer message people in russia china india the message is spreading the world but if all we are is protestants and catholics we're on the wrong side of the bible right if we're just what we call christians and not being the bride you even heard a preacher one time years ago say i know i'm born again because i don't know whether i'm in the bride or not i just sit there and shoot my head if you're born again that is the bride amen but that was his point you see the deceiving in man's mind coming down into this message to turn them against the true word to destroy this message they say and the prophet had faults and failures and fallacies sure how did you human but show me where the messages got any faults and violence the message is not brother branham when he was preaching the white horse rider as the holy spirit that's not the message right right you had to correct that amen that's not the message right it's in the books it's not the message right the message don't have any fallacies right come and show me that's right amen come and show me the fallacies of the message years ago people said it was 17 i think it was contradictions in the church age book i put it on the internet put it everywhere send me them contradictions right i ain't done it yet all right because they know that a lot of them contradictions is silly foolish statements they think he made wrong yeah let the holy spirit put it together brother you believe everything brother brown said i believe the message of what he said then the other is like when he said one day he said one day said the black and white will fight again and die like flies it's not right quote the next message he said that was my idea it was not thus saith the lord but you know what they are dying like flies around the world but the message is true let me give my stand for the message and said this prophet's message is thus saith the lord right amen if not we better be finding us another prophet and like i said one ago where was everybody at when the prophet was here they wouldn't get up and say nothing while he was here that's right i think it's time the prophet said we need to look people in the eye and say you're not saying what paul said big man in his messenger said listening to him one day he kept saying run around and said shortly and raise my hand i said he didn't say it brother yeah he said so and so we'll see everybody that i would have took the man's word the brother run said i said he didn't say that i said here's what he said group just said you left that off he said well okay i'll say it for my words i said continue on as long as you don't say brother brown said it all right see where's the mercy of the people at right well so-and-so said run around said so-and-so don't know whether it's true or not but heaven helped those people that say those things because that's death amen he said well why are they still living brother there because they've got to be there to be deceivers that's right they must need to be heresies among you that they better prove maybe make manifest the guy was standing up in the pulpit and said brother brown was wrong and a filler fire struck him and killed him dead everybody in the ability to run out and they believe right around was right wouldn't it a man just got killed but because he don't get killed it's more deceiving let's go into the communion foot washing
