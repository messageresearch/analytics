========================================

we appreciate the lord we thank you all for uh um the prayers that were they've been they were sent forth amen for brother royal and and and of course you know as most of you all know the lord took him home and and so many people around the world there they prayed but god ultimately had his perfect will done and you just continue to pray for his family and continue to pray for the church got many decisions and i'm sure things that they have to decide upon here in the next several months and but you just pray for strength for sister cynthia sister chi-chi as many know her their daughters it was just a it was i know i think i believe that they may be watching in right now and some other people from the philippines but it just um just a privilege to have gotten to know him brother royale amen and and uh not just that but just to work alongside with him um and just some other thing just one of the things that i really that really i always enjoyed about brother world is just his humility and that always grabbed your attention and not only that but that he was always it was so friendly to anybody he would always get down to their level no matter if it was a little kid no matter if it was an adult and um and the fact that uh he was just so easy easy to get along with so uh we just thank god for his life and we're definitely i was i was coming here and i was listening to that song there is a land that i'm longing for though i've never seen it before i've got loved ones over there waiting on that shore amen and they're and it's not a million miles away but i'm some far off distant or on some far distant way but i'll speed up and they'll slow down and there is a land amen so they're not they're not just they're not far away somewhere you know they're just right here amongst us just in another dimension and i believe that with all my heart so um they're just listening in and kind of telling us come on let's keep going keep moving amen this thing's just about about done and uh we just thank god for that praise the lord jesus i don't want to keep you all standing too long so um let's just go ahead go ahead and go to the word of the lord uh we're going to read from john chapter 15 john chapter 15. and i i want to continue on what i started a few weeks ago about a week or two ago on advancing god's kingdom by fulfilling the law of christ and this is part two and so let's let's just let's just go to the lord in prayer our heavenly father we thank you lord once again for the opportunity that you've given us lord to gather together in your name lord we thank you father for lord all that you are doing father god everything that you've done and all that you will do lord sometimes the father even though we don't understand the things that you allow or permit in our lives but lord god there for our own good lord because you said father in your word that all things work together for good to them that love god and lord we just uh thank you father for the privileged lord that we have that we can have confidence in you father in this hour knowing that you know all things lord bless your word now father as we're getting ready to open back the pages of it lord we ask that you were just anointed lord help us to say something that would edify the people lord and that you would be glorified lord jesus and help us lord give us revelation understanding father from your word for certainly lord we are living in the last days father and lord how much father god that we're living in the last days how much more lord we should come together lord god in unity lord amongst each other lord as your little bride lord jesus just as the as the body lord god works together father and you father be in the head lord we have a head father physically on our bodies and it all functions together lord god there's not one pulling in one way not another part pulling another way but lord god it all works together and when one father god is is damaged lord the rest of the body hurts father and so lord jesus we just pray father that you would help us to have that mindset lord that what we do father god against you lord god maybe we think we may be doing it lord on our own nobody else knows but lord god ultimately it hurts the body lord and we just pray heavenly father to help us to be mindful of these things we just commit this time now into your hands bless those lord they're sick and continue to strengthen their bodies lord we thank you for the good reports that we've been hearing and we just appreciate lord god what you are doing now we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen praise the lord amen let's just read john chapter 15. started at verse 8 it says herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples amen so you want to be a disciple of the lord you you bear fruit you have to bear fruit as the father hath loved me so have i loved you and then he says here continue ye in my love if you keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love notice how he he continues talking about love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full verse 12 this is my commandment that ye love one another he didn't say it was his suggestion but he said this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends now you think about that are you willing to do that can you love so much can you love the brotherhood the sisters so much that you are willing to lay down your life for him for them ye are my friends if if ye do whatsoever i command you this is jesus speaking these things i command you that ye love one another amen and then in galatians chapter 6 verse 2 it says bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ amen god bless you you may be seated this half this morning amen in in the contemporary english version that says you obey the law of christ when you offer each other a helping hand amen so that's what we're we've been discussing here is the law of christ amen we we we last time when we were talking about we were talking about the uh the the commandments and how god in his commandments in the old testament when he gave forth his commandment he he he talked about he talked about love within his commandments and and we're just kind of just go over here just just a little review for those that may may have missed what we talked about but um if you read in matthew chapter 24 we uh in verse 9 through 14 we won't read it all but in verse 12 it says that in the last days because of iniquity amen shall abound the love of many shall wax cold amen in other words it'll dwindle it it it'll dwindle and uh and we're we're seeing that today amen i mean we've we've been seeing it for for for years but we see it even more and more amen the love of many shall wax cold because of iniquity abounding because of so much sin abounding amen and we talked about what iniquity was and what it is is gross immorality or injustice or wickedness amen the condition of one without law or lawlessness and it's certainly getting to that point amen in the in the day and time that we are living in uh uh as i said mentioned last time you know you don't even have to even look in the news to see the lawlessness and the and the attitude that people have taken in the in this day and time and it's certainly the the the the spirit of laodicea my rights it's what i i it's about me being happy i don't care what you think it's about me being happy my body my choice you know and all these things amen and and so that's that's the type of age that we are living in now amen it doesn't matter what you do don't matter what you think about me it's what i think was what i and that's what i'll do and so that's that's that is uh it's it's a form of selfishness amen people don't people don't live for each other anymore they care for what they can get for themselves and so um brother branham he talked about what iniquity was and and part of uh four four things that that he mentioned and you read these things through quotes um one of the things he mentioned about iniquity is that it it has it has a hypocrisy involved in it amen because brother branham says here and you know that god's word is right why do you play the hypocrite amen another another attribute of of iniquity is blatant disobedience um brother brown says here see and it's right before you that you shouldn't do it but yet you still do it amen people don't care nowadays people it doesn't matter to them amen what you say or what the word of god says what what even their parents told them taught them when they were growing up amen it doesn't matter anymore it's just what i can get out of life pride and another attribute of iniquity pride and self-centeredness amen when you know your creeds are wrong and you still hold to it amen you can show somebody that they're wrong even from the word of god and they'll still want to acknowledge it they still that pride won't let them see or let them humble themselves amen because of because of an in iniquity and then another attribute of iniquity is that it begins in the heart and eventually it manifests outwardly so yeah iniquity doesn't just start you don't start just being you know iniquitous i guess you could say that amen it begins from the heart it's things that you start thinking about it's things that that you start meditating and pondering and man it was it was uh uh korra and dathan when when moses was bringing them out of the children of israel out of egypt and even probably as they were coming out of egypt cora and nathan were already starting to think who is who is this moses you know that you know started trying to lift themselves up a little bit you know and and and say well god just doesn't bless moses god just doesn't go work through moses but god can also work through us as well you see and all that just started lifting up eventually it turned into iniquity and we know where we're eventually dathan and korra ended up amen so that that is that is iniquity and it starts in the heart amen and um and so we see that the love of many shall wax cold amen iniquity will be abundant in this day there's plenty of iniquity but in the love of many will dwindle not completely go away it says the love of many shall wax cold doesn't mean that it'll completely go away but but but to to many it will dwindle yeah and then when you look at that word their love is the is the word agape which is the love the love of god amen less and less we see in the love of god when god is calling us for love and unity more in this hour we allow the externals a man to let that love dwindle from one another now that is god's fault that's our fault amen so we should watch that especially as the bride of christ amen we should be in unity we should be in love and harmony amen maybe we don't agree with everything we and you might have a different opinion than i do but even yet amen the word of god is the common ground that we have the message of the hour is where we can all put our faith and trust and rest upon amen if you think that you can just because somebody doesn't agree with you politically or doesn't see a world view that you see amen doesn't mean that you have to hate your brother or hate your sister amen amen this is what should put us amen this is our common ground amen it's the word of god praise the lord amen and then there's many times but we read different uh uh quotes where brother branham talked about the love of manny wax and cold uh he he said something here we got plenty of teaching plenty of churches but we need a love of god amen so we have plenty of that amen but the love of many are still waxing cold why because we allow the things of this life we allow other things to grab more of our tension and and to take hold of our hearts instead of the word of god taking hold of your heart and when the word of god takes hold of your heart which is him amen your love should increase amen the love of god the agape love should increase in your life amen praise the lord jesus now i'm just reviewing again you just bear with me amen uh brother brown said that there's no feeling nowadays you know no feeling no trust i mean we don't we don't we don't trust anybody there's no affection for love anymore amen and uh and then we we read there in john 15 10 where jesus said if you keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love amen and so we talked about how in in the old testament the ten commandments were given uh we read in exodus chapter 20 uh and in verse six it says and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments so love was part of the original commandments of god amen and then jesus go comes along in mark chapter 12 and we don't we won't read it all but there there he uh a scribe came to him and asked him lord what is the greatest commandment and uh he and and jesus told him and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all well actually verse 29 says and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and then he continues and says and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength amen then then he says here and the second is like it's like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and then he says there is none other commandment greater than these it wasn't he didn't give him you know you shall not steal you shall not commit adultery you shall not bear false witness or anything like that he said thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these that he was talking about so so love is the greater commandment but in order for you to have that love in you amen in order for you to express that love you've got to have the love in you in the form of the holy ghost in the form of the new birth praise the lord amen and so um then we started reading there in john chapter 13. now i want us to pay attention there to john chapter 13 because in reading john chapter 13 my goodness if you if if you just pay close attention attention to it it really the the events that took place they're just just so so tight this day the things that we are seeing in this day the apostasy uh the the the the humility yet that jesus was showing and we talked about how there in in verse in verse one how jesus knew amen that uh that he was gonna be glory god glorified that he god had given him everything amen and and then we read on where jesus uh uh where in verse two it says and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot to betray jesus so see now it's starting in in in judas amen satan put it in his heart to betray jesus put it in his heart amen so the satan comes in little by little he'll come in maybe by a saying there will be a saying and then eventually it will start it'll turn into it turn into a doing and then eventually if we're not careful it'll get to our minds and and we're just completely that is what we believe and we are seeing that in this the day that we're living in amen how satan has has come in so uh sly and has dwindled that that love amen that we have that we should have for one another amen jesus amen knowing that he he knew if you read in verse 3 there in chapter 13 jesus knew he had come from god and would go back to god he also knew that the father had given him complete power and yet there later on in a few verses he gets down and humbles himself and washes the disciples feet man what an act of humility amen what an act of of of not being self-centered amen the him knowing what what he was yet he got down to watch the disciples dirty feet amen i've always often i've always said and when i go to the field mission field is the greatest act of humility or the greatest preacher that had ever existed and that is the lord jesus christ and yet he got down to wash the disciples dirty's feet amen and it it's sometimes uh there sometimes us as ministers we want to get heady we want to get you know we want somebody else to wash our feet you know we want somebody else to do things for us we we you know because we're a minister but the real a real minister the word minister means one that serves and the greatest minister that ever lived was jesus christ greatest teacher that ever lived was jesus christ and yet he got down to wash the disciples dirty feet and he didn't he wasn't asked to do that the disciples didn't ask him to do that he just did it on his own amen why it was a lesson for us not just for us to do it you're here you know we come to church once a month but it was for a general lesson for all of us for everyday living amen to live your life for one another amen it's not just about you amen but it's about the others around you as well amen praise god we talked about how what humility means is the state of character being humble freedom from pride arrogance lowliness of mind the low estimate of oneself self-abasement amen that's humility that's one thing i could say differently about brother royale soriano amen he was he was just that way he was he didn't think anything great of himself yet yeah he was so well known but yet he didn't even know that that people knew and were so so touched by his ministry he didn't even think anybody uh was was being touched by his ministry in his life and his dedication and his sacrifice and he's touched many lives amen that's how we should be amen you want to touch someone's life amen humble yourself humble yourself people will look at that amen and then uh just just just still just still reviewing here you can just continue to read that there in john chapter 13. amen and then uh and then now we just we jus uh let's just well let's just start there in verse 18 and brother the brothers could bring up verse 18. amen and we'll start here amen jesus continues he says here i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen who i have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled watch what the reason why he does this but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me now we know that judah said man he ate with jesus but did not eat jesus because jesus at one point you know how he said i am the bread of life and if you eat me you shall live you shall live eternally amen many people ate with jesus many people dined with jesus even simon the pharisee even some of those pharisees they invited jesus to eat with him but they did not they ate with jesus but they did not eat jesus in other words they did not take advantage of what he was trying to really give amen the food that he was really trying to give amen and so jesus knew amen who he had chosen there in that room where he was at with the disciples but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me jesus had no other purpose in this life when he came here on earth but to fulfill the word of god and that is that should be the desire and that should be the heart and our mindset here on earth as sons and daughters of god is to fulfill the word of god amen to fulfill to fulfill his word in other words to keep his commandments amen and so in hebrews chapter 6 verse 4 through 6 it says for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have watched it says it's impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucified to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame amen you received the word for your day you received the the word for for for for your hour and and and and you reject it you leave it aside amen for something else for your own opinion for your own amen your own iniquity overtakes that amen there is nothing else that god can do for you amen there it's hard amen like in verse six there if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance it's hard for them for people like that amen they have taken on a spirit such as that to even repent again for what they did amen they're so hardened now amen they're so they're so hard but it's impossible for those that have been who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and made partakers of the holy ghost to fall away amen let's just think about that to really have the holy spirit because the holy spirit the bible said the holy spirit will lead us and guide us unto all truth now when someone supposedly tasted of the holy ghost amen to then fall away god doesn't god is not an indian giver god doesn't lose those that are his amen so you take that for what it's worth amen but we're seeing that a lot in the hour that we're living in people who we thought were just you know just firm and will you know been in this message for 40 years or more and then we hear that they're falling away that they're they don't believe this word anymore amen how can you not believe that god sent to us a prophet in this day when the when the word of god amen talks about a prophet coming in this end time then pray tell me who it is if it's not the prophet that god sent us in this day amen somebody's got to fulfill malachi chapter four uh uh uh somebody's gotta fulfill revelation the the angel that was in revelations chapter three for the the angel laodicea somebody's gotta fulfill that somebody's gonna fulfill revelations chapter 10 verse 7 amen where it talks about in the days of the voice of the seventh angel who is that then if if it isn't the prophet that god sent in this day his ministry the way it went and the way it went so so closely knit together to the ministry of moses elijah in in in the word then then who is it and we're still waiting for them then but you see we're not those that were enlightened amen really have the holy spirit the holy spirit will lead and guide you to all truth amen praise god and so all right so let's read verse 19 there in john chapter 13. now watch watch what jesus says here i just pay close attention and and and put yourself in this scene all right put yourself in this scene but pretend that you were there watching the disciples and jesus they're eating together amen because jesus had a full purpose of what was going on there in this scene now i tell you before it come that when it is come when it has come to pass ye may believe that i am he amen so jesus was warning them already the disciples there was warning them already of the apostasy that was get ready to take place just as the word has forewarned us of the apostasy that was to take place in this our day amen we read that in first and first timothy chapter four verse one and two i appreciate brother joe back there helping out with these scriptures amen first timothy chapter four look look just as jesus forewarned the disciples look at timothy forewarning us now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and watch and doctrines of devils that it says that in the latter times are we living in the latter times in the latter times some not all but some shall depart from the faith the faith amen giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils amen what's verse 2 there speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron you know when you sear something amen it's flat you know or or it's it's it it's you know you sear meat you know it's it stays that way now you know it's flat it's it's you see speaking lies in hypocrisy and that is one of the key things that you'll notice some of these people leaving the mess i'm just going to just be blunt amen some of the people just leaving the message amen they they start speaking things out of the word taking things out of context amen so that they can fit their own agendas amen that's what timothy is talking about speaking lies and hypocrisy but having their conscience seared my goodness in other words no they are they believe that they are so right about what what this newfound thing that they just found because to them leaving the message is freedom they feel so free and they feel so so uh i was so bound for so many years and and now i'm free especially the women i mean you have websites out there dedicated to women that were freed from the message and they give testimony of how free i am now and when you look at their pictures you know they look they look like lesbians now they look well tattooed up and and have painted hair and stuff like that where's the freedom in that you know and just because you had one bad experience in your lifetime doesn't mean that the rest of the message or the rest of the people that serve god and that love this message lived that way i know that there's bad apples out there amen i know that there's ba ministers who who are just so dogmatic and legalistic and and and and just knocking people upside the head with the word of god and you better serve you you know you better love the lord and you better do this that and the other amen you're never going to get anybody to serve god with all their heart when you when when some when a minister comes out that way they just nobody they'll do it for a time they'll do it out of fear and that i believe that that's what has happened in the last 40 years that we've been in the message amen ministers preachers not all of them there's been some really good ones out there that really know the balance of the word but there's been some bad apples but that doesn't mean the message is wrong that means their deliverance was wrong that means their approach to it was wrong maybe the revelation that they had of it was wrong but doesn't mean that the word of god is wrong and that the prophet the message that the prophet sent to us amen or gave us in this day by the holy spirit amen is wrong it isn't amen so you can't throw out like they say you can't throw the baby out with the bath water amen praise god all right let's continue reading john chapter 13 verse and here in verse 20. now watch verily jesus spiel still speaking verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me now now it is very interesting because in verse 19 he says now i tell you before it come that when it is come to pass ye may believe that i am he so in other words he's forewarning them of the apostasy and then he comes in and talks about he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me now why why would he say something like that amen because remember in one place he jesus says he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward amen he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me amen so in other words amen you received those that god sent you recognize that that is a man of god or or receive we're talking about the prophet for our day amen you recognize that ministry wasn't brother branham's ministry it wasn't his own ministry it was the ministry of god through him amen it wasn't brother branham's message it was the message of god amen to brother brown brother branham could not restore the word back to us that it had been eaten down throughout all the ages he could not have done it by himself it had to be in god to do that but because the bible says that in amos 3 8 that he will not do anything unless he shows it first to his servants the prophets amen so he must and he has to use a prophet he he's got to use an individual amen and you will receive a benefit or you will receive a reward if you receive that whomsoever he's rece he sends you because who if you receive him amen you receive the word he's saying you receive him and then eventually you're receiving the father as jesus says here he that receiveth me jesus being their messenger for their day receives the father amen receives the one that sent him i hope that you're understanding what what i'm trying to say with that it's just very interesting that that is in there amen that verse is in there then in verse 21 when jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit after he had said that he was troubled in spirit and testified and said verily verily i say unto you when jesus says verily verily that means absolutely absolutely for sure i say i'm saying to you that one of you shall betray me one of you it wasn't one of the one of the somebody that was outside of the room that they were in or one of the pharisees will betray me no one of you will betray me amen do you know saints the ones that will sadden you the most are the ones that are closest to you your own family members are the ones that will will will will will sadden you the most and it was it was the same with with jesus amen it was one of his that he chose himself that he picked and that he gave power and you read in matthew chapter 10 he gave power to all the disciples including judas to cast out devils heal the sick and and all those all those all preach but none of that amen judas was justified sanctified but never got to the holy ghost why because he let satan talk to start working in his heart verse 22 then the disciples looked at one another doubting o whom he spake now here's jesus telling them one of you will betray me and the disciples are looking at one another what one of us what because judas was so like them was so much like them in in that they didn't even they didn't even even realize or think that it was judas there would be judas you see saints we've been we've been we've been a a fellowship and with all these brethren and all these people that have left the message through for years gone to fellowship meetings with them had meetings with them and shook their hands hugged their necks heard them preach and and do all that and you would never have thought that it would be one of them to eventually leave this word that's exactly what's happening in this hour and so that's the reason why we we looked at one another what he did what she did what that's what the disciples are doing when jesus said one of you will betray me they're like what and then now they're they it should start causing something in you lord i hope it's not me i hope it's not me amen it should send the holy fear in you amen lord i don't want to betray you i don't want to betray you now i'm just wondering if if if judas was looking with them you know he probably was he probably maybe looked at peter and said you know knowing what he was already working in his heart you see how sly people people can be when satan is working in their heart that total hypocrites total total uh uh uh just mind seared they'll just play the part so easily and you will miss it so easily this is what's happening here in this in this chapter amen the one that was to betray jesus was so intertwined with the disciples that they couldn't figure out who it could be that jesus was talking about amen it remind reminds me of the parable amen of the wheat and the tares amen and brother joe if you could bring that that matthew chapter 13. we'll just read this real quick here in matthew 13 it's verse 24 he says here and it's interesting that this is matthew chapter 13 just like john chapter 13. amen i don't think that's a coincidence another parable verse 24 another parable put forth put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of heaven we're talking about a kingdom amen the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while man slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the we who was the one that put that into judas's heart it was satan the enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also amen so the servants of the householder came and said unto him sir that is not thou sow good seed in thy field from once then hath it tears in other words lord didn't you sow good seed in this field amen why is there tares why are there weeds then verse 28 he said unto them an enemy hath done this amen the servant said unto him well thou then that we go and gather them up in other words they were asking him should we go ahead and just pluck out those weeds now watch what jesus says here in this parable he said nay in other words no lest while ye gather up the weeds or the tares ye also root up the wheat with them so leave them alone watch in verse 30 let both grow together until the harvest right and then the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together the first first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn now brother joe i don't know if you got these these pictures i sent you two pictures um the first one and you could go back uh i believe i preached the message back in 2016 called put in or put on where i talked about the wheat and tares kind of went deep and you can go back and listen to that but but this is this is this is wheat and that is that is a terror that is a plant uh what is the name of that plant it's called the darnell weed and that weed that that that plant grows with the wheat in the field and it looks just like wheat and it's so easy to not be able to tell them apart because they look a lot they look alike and so the next the next picture the difference between ripened wheat and tares amen i know that's not a big picture but one of the differences is wheat produces white seeds and while tears this darnel weed produces dark poisonous seeds wheat one of the other characteristics is that wheat bows when it's ripe amen when wheat is ripe amen it bows see how it's bowing it bows well when when darnell weed or tears when they come to their maturity they stick straight up amen they they they're proud and they're haughty and i mean don't we see that today these people that leave the left a message amen they are just so proud and so lifted up now and you you can't tell them anything and every every time you make you might want to say something or be not amen they lift themselves up you know you know and you know i'm not calling them terrors i'm just saying to bother fruit you shall know them let the word amen let the word uh say what they are amen i believe god has a chance amen for them but if they'd never repent if they're if that's truly down if satan has truly entered into their hearts amen there's no way to renew those people back amen but that's that's that's characteristics amen so when when a child of god amen is re when you're the more of the word of god that you get the more humble it should make you amen that's true wheat amen that that's why that's why we bow the more humble it should make us amen and then uh uh darnell weed or the or tares amen they stick out they stick out amongst amongst the the the wheat and then another characteristic is that weed is golden in color and the tracks your life should attract others around you amen it should not it should not detract but it should attract amen not necessarily by the things we say not necessarily by the things we do amen but but our life amen amen do we attract one another uh do we attract others or do we detract them amen i want to attract people amen and of course tears amen they're darker in color darker in color compared to the wheat amen so that's that you can go back and and you can even do a search online and even look at more pictures of of what tares and wheat look like and they look just alike that's why it was so easy for for that's why jesus was saying don't don't pull them up together don't pull them up together uh wait until they they they come to maturity because in in in trying to pull them up together at a young stage it's easy you'll easily pull out the true wheat as well so but let them come to maturity in other words let them show their colors jesus didn't tell jesus knew the whole time that when he when he chose judas that he would be the son of perdition he knew that the whole time but he never made a fuss about it he he just left it alone and waited to that here in john chapter 13 where judas finally showed his colors see waited to to the moment where he would eventually do what was really in his heart to do just leave people alone you can't argue with them you can't you can't try to sway them back uh if if if they're set in their heart that that's what they want to do there is nothing that you and i can say amen that will convince them because if the word doesn't convince them amen then you and i cannot amen we will show them the word if they come to us and ask us questions we should be willing to give them answers but don't be upset and don't get discouraged that you cannot sway them to your to the way of thinking of the word amen if it's not the word that does it if it's the holy spirit that doesn't sway people amen that doesn't bring people back to the word of god then you and i there's nothing you and i can do praise the lord amen so in verse 23 verse 23 and john chapter 13 continuing here so after jesus said that let after jesus said that in in verse 22 then the disciples looked at one another doubting of whom he spake and then verse 23 says now there was leaning on jesus's bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved at that moment when jesus was talking and they were eating and they were fellowshipping there was a disciple that was leaning on jesus bosom now if you if you study this closely it has to be john john was the one that was leading on but yet john's humility was so great that he didn't even mention his name in there there's other instances where john's humility amen the holy ghost had taken so much of his in his life and man he don't he was writing the word but he never mentioned his name almost leery of people amen who who write books about the message and things like that and they got their names plastered all over it amen written by pastor so and so you know john you know amen when it should be amen god gets the credit amen their their name is bigger than the name of the lord jesus christ you know you almost wonder what what what are they trying to wha what are they trying to portray but it wasn't so with john john being part writing the word of god that we read today he he says here amen there was a leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved he left it as that verse 24 simon peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom jesus spake that was going to betray him so peter was like hey you're leaning on jesus go ahead and ask him ask him you know and so that's what that that's what peter is is telling him i want you just go ahead and ask him see what you can get out of him so in verse 25 it says he then lying on jesus's breasts saith unto him lord who is it amen i like that that he then lying on jesus's breast amen because you're not going to get anything from god unless you're close to his breast unless you are feeding off the breast of el shaddai the breasted one amen you won't get receive anything from it but if you're if you hardly come to church if you hardly read the word if you hardly pray you're not going to receive from god amen you're not going to get amen what you want if if you can't even do the simple things as to lean on jesus's breast praise god and because jesus said ask and you will receive seek and you shall find jesus gives them an answer in verse 26 jesus answered he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i have dipped it now asap is a piece of morsel of food a piece of food whom i shall give a piece of food to to when after i have dipped it and when he and watch and when he had dipped the sop he gave it to judas iscariot the son of simon now we don't know if jesus did this right away after after he had answered amen jesus did not even say his name jesus did not even say that it's judas did not even say his name amen all jesus did was pointed out using the food that they were all eating together pointed out with the food that they were all eating together amen and isn't that how it's been amen throughout the years amen they god has pointed them out amen by the food that we've all been eating together throughout all the years amen this same word the same message amen that eventually amen jesus points them out by their fruit you shall know them amen because the word will eventually point them out praise god and verse 27 it says and after the stop watch this and after the sop after that piece of morsel that that morsel of food satan entered into him now it wasn't now now it's not satan put in his heart now as satan entered into him and then said jesus unto him that thou doest do it quickly now he said it to him he didn't tell he didn't announce it to all the rest of the disciples he just told judas whatever you're going to do just go ahead and do it quickly amen praise god so not only was jesus trying to declare who it was that would betray him amen but above this jesus was letting him judas know that he himself knew that he would be betrayed by him and therefore because judas knew this jesus knew that jesus knew that he was going to be the one to betray him and yet he still went ahead and did it his iniquity was even greater amen it was still in his heart amen to do what he wanted to do and to go out and do the intentions that he still did amen jesus in in giving him the sop in in in in doing what he was doing he was also letting judas know i know what you're doing i know what you're going to do so just go ahead and do what you're doing but he was also giving him a chance a chance to go ahead and hey there's there's a way you can stop what you're about to do amen but i know that you're about you're about to do this but yet in him doing that judas knowing amen that he jesus knew he still went out and did what he did amen what a great iniquity in this hour not the the the people of this day amen you can present the word to them you can present truth to them but they'll still want to go out and do what they what it whatever is in their heart and there's nothing that you can do about it not even jesus could stop say judas amen from doing what he was supposed to do so it turned now from what satan had put in his heart in verse two where we read the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot to now satan entering into judas right that was just full-blown iniquity now amen praise god jesus didn't make a fuss about it or didn't try to even stop judas why because remember it was so that the scriptures the word could be fulfilled like he said in in verse 18 he said i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me amen so that the scripture can be fulfilled so saints i say this because we we you know we've been seeing people falling away for the past several years now more than likely we'll see even more fallen away you're still going to see surprises you're still going to have don't always keep in mind so that the scripture can be fulfilled the scripture that we read in first timothy there amen that there will be a great fallen away in the end that has to be fulfilled amen that scripture has to be fulfilled and therefore people are fulfilling that scripture unknowingly but that is what's happening amen verse 28 i'm i'm almost done verse 28 now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him so none of the disciples understood why jesus told him go do what you need to do quickly and do it quickly they didn't understand here jesus is telling them the one that i give the sop to that's the one that will betray me they were so so it was they didn't even have in their thoughts that it would be judas that they could they could not see that for themselves he clear jesus clearly let them all know who would betray him yet not one of the tables was still getting it verse 29 it says for some of them thought some of the disciples stopped because judas had the bag or in other words he kept the finances that jesus had said unto him by those things that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to the poor and in verse 30 he then having received the sob judas having received this up went immediately out and it was night amen one of the characteristics that you will notice of people that leave this word is that when you expose them they don't want to be around you when you expose that you know they oh you know they get scared amen it was so in in brother brown's ministry amen when he would pray for the sick amen and satan was being exposed brother brown would say that that the people's uh face reactions would change amen when satan is being exposed amen people people don't want to be around with the word where they don't want to be around the word when they're when their life is being exposed sometimes we'll see it here here in church amen when spirits are being exposed and satan is being exposed in people's life you'll see you know they'll you know some something changed and something satan doesn't like to be exposed that's why brother branham said that he hates the book of genesis and the book of revelation because he's being exposed in both of them he hates those two books and he'll attack them it's the same thing today amen when you attack or come against that spirit just as jesus attacked the spirit that was controlling that was controlling judas there amen what did you just do he immediately left he immediately went out and it says there that it was night and that's what's happening is our day it's the evening time amen it's night time and people are showing their true colors now i i say the saints because i'm trying to uh i'm gonna i'm gonna leave it right here but in the in the next several verses jesus completely now changes his his oh his of what he tells him now to something totally different now more personal now that judas is out and you can read i encourage you all to read john chapter 13 at home but we'll continue it next time but let me finish with these with these quotes brother branham brother branham says here in modern events made are made clear by prophecy in 1965 he says and you know that same things promised in this last days as janice and jamris as james and janus withstood moses so will these men of reprobate mind concerning the truth concerning the truth and when an organization keeps takes a man right down through that organization it showed it did not come from god because god does those things to attract the people's mind and then the message follows it that's what happened in jesus ministry he he he did the miracles gave the loaves and the fishes amen and after that attracted the people but watch when the word comes and the the the message is preached the word of god is preached that is what's going to show people's true colors a lot of them left they couldn't accept the same thing in the ministry of brother branham in this day amen people were flocked amen stadiums to go see people get healed maybe themselves get healed as well but when the word of god was preached and brother branham started laying out the word of god amen the doctrines of the word they couldn't receive that it was hard for the people to receive it god does those things to attract the people's mind and then the message follows it if it isn't then it's not god it's not god god always does that brother brown says judas couldn't understand it he walked right with him he didn't see it but i mean i mean the people today amen that have walked in this message uh supposedly walked in this message i mean you just you thought that they had revelation and they preached some amazing things and yet walk out and leave the word take down the cloud and all these things amen what where is the revelation in that it was only just something mentally an experience that they may have had but never it went down into their heart never an ex a true experience with the word but the real watch but the real ordained of god that real gene that real germ a soul of god that was in god before the foundation of the world remember you that's really got the spirit of god in you tonight you were here in christ because he was the fullness of the word he was the fullness of the godhead bodily god was in christ reconciling the world to himself do you believe that amen and in the church age book brother brown says now i am sure that you have noticed that those whose names were in the book of life well it's not the lamb's book of life but the book of life were a part of the religious order of that day that centered around the true god and worship of him though they did not worship according to truth word like judas they didn't go all the way see how judas was chosen of god he was instructed in truth you can't say that these people did not have truth they had truth they just didn't continue in that truth he shared knowledge of the mysteries he had a ministry of power granted unto him and he healed the sick and cast out devils in jesus name but when the showdown came he sold out for gold and political power he did not go up to pentecost to receive the spirit of god he was devoid of the spirit make me watch what brother brown says here make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the holy ghost into the body of christ not just baptized amen on the flesh but watch by the holy ghost into the body of christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way we'll be in the word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost failed multitudes fail right there and when they fail to go on in that word their names are taken off the book of life now i didn't say it brother branham was the one that said it and the word of god says amen the true bride of christ in this hour amen will continue with all the word amen and none of these scarecrows amen will scare will scare her oh my goodness are you not 80 of the people left the message that doesn't scare me and it shouldn't scare you amen if you're truly baptized into the body by the holy spirit amen that amen it didn't scare jesus it didn't scared uh what he was going to do he knew where he stood that judas was going to do what he was going to do he just moved on and just let him do what he was needed to do let these people do what they need to do because why the scripture must needs fulfilled amen now hopefully next next time we'll continue with this but we'll talk about we'll we'll intertwine it now with with the commandment amen of what of the lord and uh of what jesus was speaking there in uh i forgot the title of our message here the law of christ amen in order to advance the kingdom of god praise the lord you love him amen let's just let's just sing that song real quick i love him i love him because he first loved me let's just stand to our feet hope trust that you receive something i mean i encourage you all to to to just look into this yourself amen look look into it yourself let let god reveal this to you and and and and see how this so parallels with what's going on in our day and because it was in the word already it should not take us by surprise although it does amen and unfortunately we're here amen but the god said in his word that he will have a bride without spot or wrinkle amen and i believe that with all my heart let that be you amen let's just let's just uh let's just bow our heads our heavenly father we thank you once again lord for thee for allowing us lord to hear your word lord to open about the pages of your word father and trust lord jesus that the people father god listening
