========================================

yeah anymore that's right hope everybody's doing good yeah hope everybody's happy excellent restful week and expect them for another good restful week we are we got it sound all week so usually usually during this time we're all doing some sort of mission trip and I decided to stay home stay stay here and we just do a little cabin we just don't stay there all week long up in Franklin North Carolina I wish everybody oh oh good Christmas and a good it's just rest just take a break and enjoy yourself prepare yourself not just physically enjoy everybody that you that sometimes we just take for granted and we don't we don't not just enjoy this because tomorrow they may be gone but Lord willing next year early full steam ahead we've got to mission trips planned Philippines Costa Rica Nicaragua and Honduras again and so y'all pray for us because there's so much work to be done so many people that need to work so but then this morning we want to talk about this is gonna be a little scattered this morning and I do apologize for this but I think it just though I think it's appropriate in this in this time you know - well I want to talk I want to talk this morning and I should have shown a picture but however oh they don't know what this magazine is right now each and every one of us knows what magazine this don't want to talk a little bit about this you know this this particular oh yeah image and a lot of people they look at this they look at this page and they read what what what took place here but never never stopping to think what's on the other side what's on the other page and this right here is very significant it goes along exactly with this now I want I want to I want to just talk about that whole we'll talk about it yes Lord well and when I'll come back and everything I want to have a full sermon about it this is just little bits and pieces here in there but that cloud to me Saints is a it was a token for each and or one of us it's not what saves us right right but it is a sign so for example you know if I give if I give you know let's say brother brother brother Bob gives me this phone and I've done this example before this is a sign you see it's a token that he appreciates me it's a gift that you gave to me right but really every time I look at this phone it's it's you know it should take me back to the giver you see what I'm saying right I think a lot of people a couple of months ago I preached the message about the token and I talked about the relics and things like that and I think some people misunderstood me and the thing is is that a relic is something that you look at for salvation yeah see and it shouldn't be that way all right see for example when I take this phone that brother Bob gave me this should take me back to the giver you see what I'm saying this is not what I worship right this is not what I this is not the token is the the relic is not what I worship our worship is the one that gave me the right you see and the word relic isn't something bad the word relic is something that that that means it's a sign you see a sign that should take you to the to the main source when I look at you know a sign that says Albuquerque New Mexico 40 miles 45 miles ahead well that sign is not Albuquerque New Mexico Albuquerque New Mexico is further on and I think that's where a lot of people misunderstood me in that but I wanted to kind of clear that up and so that's the exact same thing about this cloud this cloud wasn't oh because I have a picture of a cloud I'm a message believer know a lot of people that had the cloud in their churches and in their homes and things like that and still don't understand or do not believe the message because the message is Christ the cloud is just a symbol it's a token Amen it's a sign about things that really really uh vindicating things in the scripture but really that cloud was also for brother branham as well because it it was a thing for him to go back east which was jefferson bill to preach the seals but to us as the Bride of Christ and that's a sign for us so throughout all these scriptures you see where God used clouds God used God use clouds one of the scriptures here that I was looking at where it is in Genesis chapter 9 verse 13 and you seen him God told no other and he said I don't think it's gonna see verse yes verse 12 not in 12 I don't know if you can see that or not see if I can make it bigger yes and God said this is the token of the Covenant which I make between me and you see he said a token and God said this is the token of the Covenant which I meant between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations verse 13 I do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth now wherever there's usually a cloud in the in descriptors there's always a bow attached to it and what is that boat well it's a rainbow praise the Lord by the way yes there is a bow attached to it alright so and he continues here and it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud as interesting where's third verse fourteen all right we look at like I said you know this is kind of kind of scattered but let's see here let's look at I'm looking at it in the New Testaments I found some it's a pretty good image now in mountainous figuration when Jesus went up with the disciples there was a cloud that was in on the mountain that took that took them up you see in verse chapter 17 verse 5 he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased - llúria him mark 9 7 and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and the voice came out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son and hear him alright Luke 9 34 while he does spank there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud that's kind of interesting so I don't mess the place here but anyways anywhere in the scriptures where usually we're talking about clout it's when God when God involves a cloud in any sort of ministry and you see it in Moses ministry there was a cloud up on the mountain now that the Bible says if you read there in Exodus I believe is Exodus chapter 20 and I want to get into more detail with this and maybe in another sermon but when Moses entered into that cloud he saw the cloud right he was in that cloud but the people down at the bottom of the mountain also saw the cloud and they feared and they wondered where as Moses gonna die where is he going to come back is what's going on but there was a cloud involved in the in the ministry and the same thing with this with our day if God had a ministry like the prop of the minute the ministry of brother branham prophet - to vindicate revelations 10-7 Malachi 4 5 & 6 but i'ma tell you Saints if if it wasn't brother Branham and the life that brother Branham live then tell me who is then right then we are still living within those industries those versatile not vindicated yet in other words you see then that means we're waiting for somebody else so if it wasn't in the life of brother Branham then who was you see so in the same thing God had to use the same patterns from the Old Testament in the New Testament the scripture he had to use the same patterns in this day in order to vindicate the the Word of God to us amen praise the Lord so so I want to show you guys the love you may have seen this before hopefully I can bring it up all right so in this day and age we have we have the iCloud or the cloud and I mean if the cloud isn't a big deal the natural types of spirituous yeah you see we're living in the age of cloud technology very information what is the cloud all right the cloud right now is it lists us speaking naturally what the cloud is is anything that you have any files audio services of any sort you know documents or anything that you can have on a local computer it can be synced to a server that's out there somewhere somewhere else they call it the cloud but it's somewhere else most of us don't even know where it is but you have access to it you see other people but that's the reason why they have to password protect the things and stuff like that they have to have a certain amount of security to go along with it now so what they're saying is you don't have to have everything are in a physical computer see we're used to everything being a little in a physical hard drive and I have my music in the physical hard drive I have my music all stored locally to a computer but those times are earth they're getting away more and more for you to be able to have access to access just physical things they're trying to put everything up in the cloud so that you can access it from anywhere in the world now you take that for example take that with God now remember God was the one who originally created the he was the one he was the first iCloud service he was the first cloud service you know brother Graham said that when they sent a man to space you know that they said well that's that's wonderful but we've had a man in space for 2,000 years and prayer was the first you know Wi-Fi connection for us you see now I speak in these lean goes even further that Bob knows what I'm talking about some of you know what I'm talking about because this is what we deal with every day you know we deal with these things and so but it's interesting that that I cloud the cloud and all these things syncs all these items in and the same thing with this with this cloud all right the cloud which is let's just say it's God the only way that you can connect to it is by faith you sink your sink to it by faith in other words you look at his word and you say Lord I believe it that settles it in my heart and you watch that cloud or you watch God amen on the scene and fulfill that word in your life for whatever need that you may have no matter where you're at I can I can put something here on my on my tablet in into the cloud all right it's it's a space I don't know I don't know where the the main server is I just know that it's there in the same thing with us with God I don't know where where he where he is as far as I just know that he's there I just know that he's living in me I just know that he's working in my heart I have a connection with him you see and and I can put something there in the cloud tomorrow I can be in the Philippines and I can access that in the cloud I don't have to access the physical computer that I that I uploaded it from back in in Winder Georgia no because it's in the cloud you see it's all there all the promises that he gave us amen they're all there and to access them wherever your our act we serve an ever-present and the time of trouble I see so in Hebrews 2:12 1 it says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses in other words it's interesting that it uses the cloud of witnesses or in other words like a token a sign a cloud a sign you see let us lay aside every weight in the sin which that's so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us you know today sinking things on the cloud as a matter of fact what you're seeing right now I do not have it on this lap on this iPad physically you're singing this document from the cloud I have what's called Dropbox and everything's synced in the cloud and I just put stuff in there whenever I'm working for example on the podcast that I work all my files you go to this cloud and I can work on my podcast over the radio program anywhere in the world because all of my files are stored right there so so this this this up what was I to say with that so it's an easy thing it's an easy thing why if we're not using it it's it becomes so simple that there should not be any excuse in other words to not use it so that's what in other words that's what God is trying to tell us here let us lay aside the weights and the sins that so easily besides in other words Christ has already done the heavy work for you him the cloud it's already doing the heavy work for you you don't have to push yourself to to to serve you know to do this that are the other to forgive I've always said there's nothing I can do you fell there's nothing not going to do to to merit God's forgiveness there's nothing I can do to to forgive my own sins to erase my own saying there's nothing right so why feel bad about the things sometimes we fail and we make mistakes why feel bad why feel condemned about those things when you know you can't even do anything about it the cloud is already taking care of it do you see what I'm trying to say in other words God has already taken care of it Jesus Christ has already taken up the heavy work for you for YouTube to to fret to fear the only one that can bring condemnation in your life is Satan the Bible says now there is now no condemnation to who to those that are in Christ Jesus hello you asked my you ask yourself am I in Christ Jesus it's Christ Jesus in me because there he is and then you if you abide in him and he abides in you then there should not be any condemnation sure we were gonna make mistakes sure we're gonna fail you Eve until we get these bodies redeemed we're gonna fail him and make lots of mistakes we're gonna lose our temper we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna say things we shouldn't say we're gonna we're gonna do those things those things are gonna happen but a Christian will quickly recognize I shouldn't have said that right I shouldn't have acted that way I shouldn't have done that right away quickly and if something's not there to cause that in your life and something wrong right you need to you need to have some access to the cloud you see you need to have some access to that - that means we need to be born again we need amen first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 17 then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds see there's clouds involved there again to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord now so this right here is talking about everything that I just told you that you can sink everything to the cloud brother Branham says now here he says while in him and being in him you have access to everything he died for God's chosen plate that I was in God's relationship I said you in Christ and Christ in you you have access to everything all right so there's nothing there's nothing that doesn't that you are you and I should love it should be laughing and if we don't receive it's because we don't receive ways because we are we don't receive in faith we don't ask you don't ask you will not receive you don't see you will not fine but jesus said asking you show to see seeping yourself father not can you shall be opened unto you every promise that God has made for you is there just get the password of faith access okay and enjoy share it with others amen so that they can benefit as well yes so now I'm getting ready to I'm getting ready to talk about that all right so in this cloud here we know what the what the cloud here is this is the original picture right of course brother Branham he was told he was told to turn it sideways and it had the the uh look like Hoffman's head of Christ to him right very interesting because it also goes well with the wagged one that the Bible talked about you know and they're just different things and I'm not going to go on to all the details maybe in another sermon but but if you could take a look at this magazine and if you hold this up to the light on the other side you got this rainbow now what did revelation 10:1 say in Revelations 10:1 that says that one came down from heaven a mighty angel came down to heaven with a cloud and a rainbow over his head and you see and you see if you hold this to the light if you hold this to the light now this is this is - this is to show that this was not put the brother branham was not in a conspiracy with Life magazine to put this together you see if you hold this to the light if you hold this to the light you can see the rainbow right above the cloud now that wasn't just put there just to be put there and it's on a Life magazine called life right that you know you see now let me show you the picture here of the rainbow because it talks about rainbow of moonbeams alright this curving gracefully over the lights of the island of Oahu this is in Hawaii this took place in Hawaii now Hawaii is the 50th state 50 is an important number thank God 50th state of the United States a moon made rainbow the moon types the bride right a mum made rainbow painted the Hawaiian sky with a rare rare light now also the city where this took place where this picture was taken was taken it was in the city it was in Oahu and Oahu if you look at the meaning of the word Oahu it means they gather anyplace oh there's their spies no that's for for I'm sorry no five nine out forth one two three four it's for Allah says your moon rainbows are hardly ever seen or photographed so this is this is a rainbow caused by by the moon they require a very special combination of frequent local rain showers and especially clear atmosphere but for this remarkable picture taken at 11 o clock Life Magazine is the one that says it yeah there was a brilliant moon behind the camera and the rainstorm in front of it so we have rainstorms in our lives but we have the light of God reflected to should be reflected through our life Honolulu and the punchbowl cemetery are on the horizon at left I'm here part of the Mount Tantalus shows at the right the raindrops broke up the moonlight into the spectrum of color in the sky and photographer Warner's story was was at just right place was at just the right place between the moon and rain to show the wonder of a moonstruck storm all right and then of course then you go to the other side and they have this and the high cloud ring of mystery the mystery what is the mystery in this hour there's a boggle set what's the greatest mystery there Christ in you the hope of course so you know Saint I don't think those things are there just to be there that's very interesting that that that's article and right before that I was I was talking to brother Michael Teague last Sunday and we were talking about that and of course it brings up the fact that on the cover of this magazine and it also has Rockefeller marrying his his wife so whoever where that is I don't know but it's interesting to husband and a wife yeah taking place I'm like the bride you know and then there's also something regarding a man who went 22 times around in space around 22 time zone around the earth and then talk so you know we're and that talks about countdown you know my brother Brown preached countdown you know this is 19600 our book it's May 17 1963 now Lord Weiland I'm like I'd like to preach a little a little bit more on that but but there's other things that go down and the fact that it's that the picture was taken on February 28 1962 or 1963 February 28 28 is a very important numbering in gods in gods numerology 28 days is the cycle of a woman you see so it all ties back to the brothers crest so if that if that if that cloud was not for us and you know then then then tell me what what it was it had explained to me because even in that same article that Charles McDonald he says he said the circle was too high to be made by a jet plane and so far as dr. McDonough they determined there were no Rockets rocket planes or bombs being tested nearby that day so so it's very significant any questions any comments before we before we stop I've just happened that maybe somebody else may have preached above that I know there were brother Chad lamb up in Ohio a couple of years ago he preached a wonderful message regarding that cloud yeah and he took every single type from that from that event to prove that it wasn't a fake as they say that that it is and but I was looking at this magazine with my wife a couple of months ago and I was just reading that article my goodness it was taken at 11 o'clock at night it was taken in Hawaii the 50th state it was take it was it was a it was taken in Oahu and I looked up what Oahu mains it means the Gathering Place and Hawaii I think the Hawaii also has a meeting as well something something spiritual as well he didn't remember right at the top of my head so God's gonna have a witness I guess actually the covers fallin off I gotta tape it tape it on the inside place of the gods Hawaiian's place of the place of the gods then the Bible says you are guards right the hawai means place of the gods oh the Bible says you know ye are gods you wear too little we're little creators that's what for the RAM you said right so God bless you all whether it be nice if you take a picture of both pages this was that moment you're preaching actually what I'm gonna do there's I think online there's already an image a digital image now I'll just put put it I'm gonna put it on the screen thank you yes any other comments questions I like one more minute yes sister about how that everything we were seeing was in a cloud it wasn't on there but yeah I thought I wonder if you could type that some way that being a conduit that's a little bit and that conduit would be would be prayer yeah thank you have the tool of prayer the tool of prayer in order to access God's promises but yeah absolutely right may God bless you all [Music] thank you
