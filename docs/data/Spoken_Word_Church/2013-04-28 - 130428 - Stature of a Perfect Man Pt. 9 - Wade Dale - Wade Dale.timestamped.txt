[2:54] from his old sins all right so there's a
[2:57] purging time and I want to talk about
[2:59] that today a little bit and then next
[3:01] Sunday we'll get into sister
[3:02] Shepherd's
[3:04] dream and
[3:08] then the next Sunday I'll be here this
[3:12] coming Sunday Ginger I'll be here Ginger
[3:15] this this
[3:16] weekend let your husband do the
[3:18] preaching okay oh I see why that thing
[3:21] come off that's
[3:23] broke this thing when it fell it must
[3:25] have broke see that right there there's
[3:27] cable ties over there okay all right but
[3:30] anyway somebody said something about it
[3:33] being wobbly and awine cuz it's broke
[3:35] but we'll fix that but listen back to
[3:38] what we were talking about I Bob will be
[3:39] here March May the 10th I'm going flying
[3:43] to New Jersey so I'll be gone and um for
[3:46] that weekend so Bob will be here so but
[3:49] next
[3:51] weekend we'll bring up Sister Shepherd's
[3:53] dream but I want
[3:56] to read this quote here now look now
[3:59] these people are pet is saying how that
[4:01] we must be partakers of his divine
[4:02] nature must be now each one of us are
[4:05] trying to grow into the stature of God
[4:08] now that doesn't say
[4:10] statue statue doesn't
[4:13] move we're a stature that's height
[4:17] stature is the growth development all
[4:20] right statue is just a could be an idol
[4:22] could be all kind of things all right
[4:24] but a stature is a growth development or
[4:28] a height that we have to get to now
[4:30] after we get through the Seven Seals
[4:31] then at that time the sounding of the
[4:33] seven seal the loosening course we know
[4:35] what a seal is is to loose the ministry
[4:37] to loose Seven Seals and we'll see that
[4:39] right on the chart is loosing the
[4:40] message something that's sealed up then
[4:42] he talks about the key now he preached
[4:44] on that last Sunday the key to this
[4:46] whole thing is
[4:48] Faith the faith holds the key and the
[4:51] key is the
[4:53] scripture and Christ is the door so T
[4:57] Faith takes the little hinges of the
[4:59] scpt scripture and unlocks the glories
[5:02] of God glories and good of
[5:05] God out to his people see so it Faith
[5:09] holds the key that unlocks Christ to the
[5:10] people unlocks it revealed it so today
[5:14] he said we're going to take the same
[5:15] thing same key to unlock remember he had
[5:17] to take scripture he couldn't go back to
[5:18] a quote book that's right he was making
[5:22] the quotebook as he was preaching but he
[5:24] had no quotebook to go back to all he
[5:26] had if you'll notice in a lot of the
[5:27] videos I mean a lot of the pictures the
[5:29] Bible and the tablet that's where he had
[5:31] to get it from he had to get it from the
[5:33] scripture all right so it unlocks it and
[5:35] reveals it so today we're going to try
[5:37] to take that same key to unlock the way
[5:39] to become a virtuous Christian in the
[5:41] stature of God that and be a living
[5:44] Tabernacle for the Living God to dwell
[5:46] in he reveals himself three ways Pillar
[5:49] of Fire that was called the fatherhood
[5:51] remember in the Old Testament above God
[5:53] above us then that same God made
[5:55] manifest in Jesus Christ which he built
[5:57] a body
[6:00] made this body thirdly through the death
[6:02] of that body he Sanctified a church that
[6:04] he can dwell in so it's God above us God
[6:07] With Us and God in us the same God
[6:09] that's the reason it was called father
[6:11] son Holy Spirit not three Gods three
[6:13] officers one
[6:14] God they have only thought of that at
[6:16] the N Council we wouldn't have been all
[6:18] messed up if they hadn't if they had
[6:19] only thought of that we wouldn't have
[6:21] been all messed up see that's what we're
[6:23] trying to do now all that mess up that
[6:25] started back through the a that was back
[6:27] through the
[6:28] ages that's what brother brandham came
[6:30] to do he came to restore the faith of
[6:32] the fathers and to reveal the Seven
[6:34] Seals to show us the mysteries of God
[6:37] been hid from the foundation of the
[6:38] world now these Mysteries has been hid
[6:41] since the first age though cuz the first
[6:43] age had these virtues working in their
[6:45] life so anybody understand this is it's
[6:49] a great thing to have these virtues
[6:50] working in your life that's a
[6:52] requirement right but that's not what
[6:54] brother brand that wasn't his sole
[6:56] responsibility when he got here
[7:00] that's what he said that the the
[7:02] messenger of Malachi for do two things
[7:04] restore the hearts of the children to
[7:06] the fathers that's what the fathers had
[7:09] faith of the fathers right and then
[7:13] literally turn us back by the revelation
[7:15] of the Seven Seals which is this thing
[7:16] right here all right everybody got that
[7:20] that's this thing right here all right
[7:22] because you can be born again and not
[7:24] have all these
[7:26] virtues that's right right sure you you
[7:29] can be be born again and not have all
[7:30] these virtues cuz that's what happened
[7:32] down Through the Ages was that it wasn't
[7:35] taught and what did he say above this he
[7:37] said it has to be found in
[7:39] scripture so Peter had to put it in
[7:42] scripture and then you get Paul saying
[7:44] being born or Peter saying being born
[7:46] again then Paul saying I Die daily
[7:48] they're making they're making a a a um
[7:53] what's that Doctrine but they're making
[7:54] a a revelation known to the people back
[7:57] then that you're supposed to be all
[7:59] these
[7:59] things Peter said Silver and Gold Have I
[8:02] None go back to that and the different
[8:04] ones and and Paul you know watch Paul
[8:07] Walk he let that woman he let that woman
[8:11] that sorcerer follow him around and just
[8:13] pound on him and pound on him and
[8:15] somebody said Paul why don't you just
[8:17] rebuke the thing well why didn't he he
[8:21] might have had just a little bit of
[8:23] patience but see when the godliness came
[8:27] and the knowledge to know that it was
[8:28] God he turned a rebuked a woman why he
[8:30] couldn't do it till God told him brother
[8:33] Brown couldn't do things till God tell
[8:34] told him what to do you and I shouldn't
[8:36] do things till God tells us what to do
[8:38] now we don't have the office of a
[8:40] prophet where God speaks directly to us
[8:42] listen now with the conscious is
[8:45] together but he still speaks to us yes
[8:49] you understand what I'm saying yes
[8:50] brother Brown didn't know sometimes if
[8:52] he was in this world or in another world
[8:54] he was he was walking between Dimensions
[8:56] well
[8:57] now there's prophets in the five old
[8:59] Ministry but there was not a prophet
[9:01] like brother Brown where he could be
[9:02] just in direct contact with God cuz you
[9:05] know when sister M did what she did and
[9:06] slammed the door brother Bram said he
[9:08] didn't like that well you know that's
[9:12] probably not the only time he ever
[9:13] slammed she ever slammed a door she they
[9:15] were married for 20 something years you
[9:17] understand but God was present at that
[9:19] time talking to brother brandham and he
[9:21] had to direct his attention somewhere
[9:23] else that's why the Holy Spirit didn't
[9:25] like that it's not the holy and the Holy
[9:26] Spirit doesn't like if you get mad but
[9:28] still like that that really that really
[9:30] was a sign though to show that the third
[9:32] pool was in manifestation that even when
[9:34] we do mess up even when we do mess up
[9:37] like she did she messed up there was
[9:40] still a man there not William Brandon
[9:43] but a vessel that God could use to speak
[9:45] and say before the doctors touch the
[9:47] thing it's going to be gone okay same
[9:51] thing with you and I even though we do
[9:52] make mistakes and do make you know we we
[9:54] fumble the ball as it as they say
[9:56] there's still somebody not a prophet not
[9:59] a priest but God himself cuz when the
[10:01] mighty Angel come down I believe when
[10:04] when brother R stood there on the seal
[10:05] he was revealing Christ to us not
[10:07] William Brown to us he was revealing
[10:10] Christ but that man yielded himself so
[10:12] much to that and and you know what
[10:15] brother R said you stay under the spout
[10:16] long enough God will speak to you the
[10:18] same way and even on this this um
[10:21] message back before this I was just
[10:23] scrolling through it he went and sat
[10:24] down in the woods and he said I just sat
[10:26] there in the woods and said God what can
[10:28] you give me for my people
[10:30] and that's what Dad does and that's what
[10:31] I do I said God give me what you know
[10:33] what does the people need it's not my
[10:35] needs I can get up and make a statement
[10:38] or a or a good dissertation but it may
[10:41] be just for me yeah but I want something
[10:43] for the people I want you to be praying
[10:47] you going to get out of the service what
[10:48] you going to get out of the service cuz
[10:49] what you said before the service started
[10:51] that's right all right so we come
[10:53] expecting to see God not each other all
[10:55] right and then when we do that see
[10:57] that's what I think we've missed that
[10:59] now it's just forgive me but churches in
[11:02] the message are almost like
[11:04] denominational churches it's just a
[11:05] place to come
[11:07] and talk get together say you know have
[11:11] have some fellowship but it's kind of
[11:13] more worldly Fellowship than than
[11:16] anything but Fellowship around the word
[11:18] of God okay so that's what we're trying
[11:20] to do cuz brother brand said he said I'd
[11:22] sit there and say God what you give me
[11:24] for the people he said then I sit and
[11:25] listen that's our problem
[11:29] you think oh brother R he no he said I
[11:32] sat down at the tree let me see if I can
[11:35] find that I want him to say it I
[11:40] mean you say oh this is just for a
[11:42] prophit yeah it is but this is the way
[11:44] he got
[11:49] it now here it is yield
[11:52] yourself wait a
[11:55] minute here so for a days before we have
[11:58] a service I constantly pray go to the
[12:00] woods take in my pocket tell the wife
[12:02] I'm going squirrel hunting put a pencil
[12:04] and a tablet of paper in my pocket as
[12:05] soon as it gets loud enough to see or
[12:07] sitting against a tree somewhere hands
[12:08] up in the air saying Lord what can I do
[12:10] today what will you give me for your
[12:12] children then when I strike something
[12:14] that seems to burn down in other words
[12:17] something that won't go away something
[12:19] that just keeps keeps pounding at you
[12:21] you know and and I'm sure God saying hey
[12:24] these people need to know that they need
[12:27] to grow up in God and not be babies all
[12:29] right then when I strike something that
[12:31] seems to burn down comes something like
[12:33] this when his presence gets near I begin
[12:35] to hear something like way off in a
[12:36] distance something in this order 2 * 2 =
[12:40] 4 and if you'll listen to him on the
[12:41] tape he gets faster 2 * 2 = 4 closer 2 *
[12:45] 2al 4 he gets faster 2 * 2al 4 2 * 2 4
[12:49] and he speaks each repeat a little
[12:51] faster on and on like this it's his
[12:53] presence
[12:58] coming learn a lot from
[13:00] this yield
[13:02] yourself and after a while you break
[13:04] away from yourself there Comes The
[13:06] Vision go to such and such place such
[13:07] such thing start off from meditating
[13:09] your mind on God out of the world away
[13:11] from the world out in the wilderness to
[13:13] yourself and it starts coming one one I
[13:14] say any number or anything just
[13:16] something starts gradually faintly
[13:17] coming in then it comes faster and
[13:19] faster you sit there and raise your
[13:21] hands don't say a
[13:23] word don't say a word just hold your
[13:25] hands up in the air first thing you know
[13:27] your whole being is caught away then you
[13:29] see things that he wants you to know
[13:31] shows you something that is to come
[13:34] sometimes it comes up to a spot to a
[13:35] certain spot and then it stops and
[13:37] that's true I've been studying for a
[13:39] message or or studying for something
[13:41] here and you come up to a spot and it's
[13:44] like like you ain't even saved it's like
[13:46] you ain't even got nothing right it's
[13:47] just
[13:48] like well you know what's happening is
[13:51] is God's God's stopping you from going
[13:53] in that direction cuz you don't need to
[13:55] go in that direction right now you need
[13:57] to turn listen to him and go over here I
[14:01] I never forget one time that we were at
[14:04] U we were in Oklahoma laying in the bed
[14:07] of sleep one Sunday morning I had my
[14:09] notes of course me you know me being a
[14:11] teacher I had everything laid out all
[14:12] the quotes all the notes and I was going
[14:14] to go preach this certain
[14:16] sermon well I just sit up in the bed
[14:18] about 6:00 at Brother cla's house and
[14:20] just like I was wi awake like I had even
[14:24] asleep and a voice say preach on Abraham
[14:28] start Genesis 12 and that's all I didn't
[14:32] feel this great warm
[14:35] anointing no I I mean I got up and
[14:37] started reading the Bible Jim was there
[14:40] too I mean she was asleep but I mean I
[14:41] didn't bother her but but do you
[14:44] understand what I'm saying and changed
[14:45] the whole thing and I didn't have a note
[14:47] one and I come out and just opened the
[14:48] Bible and we just talked about Adam's
[14:50] Journey Genesis 12 justification
[14:52] sanctification baptis and the Holy Ghost
[14:54] and a lady came up to me afterwards and
[14:55] said my son hadn't been in church in 3
[14:58] or 4 months or whatever song it was and
[15:00] he was there that day and she said I had
[15:01] been praying that somebody would preach
[15:05] on that that one woman changed that
[15:08] whole
[15:09] sermon and if it wasn't but for the one
[15:11] boy that's okay makes me nervous a
[15:14] little bit
[15:15] sometimes but now I've learned and
[15:17] brother M will learn and each one of
[15:19] people that that get into the ministry
[15:21] you'll learn that that if God does that
[15:23] then you forget about you trying to do
[15:24] anything that's right if God tells you
[15:26] to preach on Genesis 12 about Abraham
[15:30] you just get up there and start talking
[15:31] and it'll just it'll just flow because
[15:33] you what you packed it in here and
[15:35] that's what brother Brand's done he's he
[15:37] had he had a knowledge of the scripture
[15:39] but watch this sometimes it comes to a
[15:41] spot to a certain spot and then stops
[15:43] I'm trying to tell you this today
[15:44] because this may help you in
[15:45] studying you know it may help you and
[15:48] and I hope to God that you take a little
[15:49] bit of time and and either study or
[15:51] think about God and think about the
[15:53] things that we're talking about that's
[15:54] right it doesn't go into a vision then
[15:57] scripture see it's easy to see a vision
[16:01] and see what's going to happen tomorrow
[16:03] that's
[16:05] easy but it said it doesn't go into a
[16:09] vision then scripture pours
[16:13] together he's taking it back to the
[16:15] Bible he's letting the prophet read it
[16:17] out of the Bible now why wouldn't he
[16:18] just pop up the scriptures in a vision
[16:21] no he wants brother Brown to
[16:22] learn to do what have knowledge that God
[16:26] was there Temperance patience godliness
[16:29] obviously brotherly kindness I grab my
[16:31] pencil so I won't forget it and write it
[16:33] down so I won't forget it oh it's from
[16:35] God you won't forget it yeah you're
[16:37] still human you'll forget it that's
[16:40] right like the um the old saying I
[16:42] always tell people the shortest pencil
[16:44] is greater than the longest memory does
[16:46] everybody understand what that means
[16:48] write it down right the shortest P the
[16:50] shortest pencil is greater than the
[16:52] longest memory so write it down and I
[16:54] come home and look it over study it and
[16:57] sometimes it don't even makes sense now
[16:59] this guy's got the Holy Ghost he's a
[17:02] prophet an end time Prophet with a
[17:06] gift sometimes it don't even make sense
[17:09] to me when I'm looking it
[17:11] over you see that and then after a while
[17:15] what
[17:16] patience after a while here it
[17:20] is that strikes and away it goes again
[17:23] and then I get a little book like this
[17:24] and just start sketching down just as
[17:26] hard as I can what he tells me I thought
[17:28] Lord I'm going down to the Tabernacle
[17:30] and tell them I said come on down I got
[17:33] something for them well that's how it
[17:36] come that's exactly until first he gives
[17:38] it to me I cannot give it out all right
[17:42] same way with our walk with God that's
[17:44] what I wanted to talk about today cuz I
[17:45] saw that and scroll through it and I
[17:46] thought
[17:47] well we got to learn how to approach God
[17:50] we got to learn how that when God does
[17:52] show
[17:54] up oh God's with you all the time
[17:59] now it's not when God shows up it's when
[18:01] we realize he's always been there all
[18:04] right it's so remember it's all on our
[18:06] side that's right it's like somebody we
[18:08] were talking about the other day you
[18:09] know God wasn't nervous when Luther was
[18:11] preaching just shall live by faith and
[18:14] was baptized and father son he wasn't
[18:16] nervous God wasn't nervous when in
[18:18] Genesis 3:15 when he said I'll put imy
[18:20] he knew all that before it ever started
[18:23] but he had to put us down here and give
[18:24] us a choice to make him a just God all
[18:28] right
[18:30] you get a lot out of Genesis remember
[18:31] brother said Genesis was a seed chapter
[18:33] so anything that had a seed or a
[18:35] beginning go back to Genesis it's in
[18:37] there
[18:38] somewhere and see that's the
[18:41] first speaking of redemption Genesis
[18:44] 3:15 so God was going to redeem us to
[18:46] start
[18:49] with he didn't just come up with that
[18:51] after the fall
[18:53] right no he made that provision before
[18:56] the foundation of the world cuz the
[18:57] Bible says go back to scripture
[18:59] says he stood as a lamb slain
[19:01] before God ever made the world so see we
[19:05] were protected before the foundation of
[19:07] the world all right you say well what we
[19:10] got to worry about well God's not
[19:12] worried that's
[19:14] right God's not worried at all there's
[19:17] no worry in him these virtues are for
[19:20] human
[19:21] beings God is the very Fountain of these
[19:23] virtues he's the Apex or the epitome or
[19:26] or or the he's the he's the ab absolute
[19:29] when it comes to these virtues okay he
[19:32] didn't need to gain them we
[19:35] do because we're in this we had to start
[19:38] somewhere because we're going somewhere
[19:40] all right and it's really beautiful that
[19:42] Redemption that was the first speaking
[19:44] of redemption and what did God say God
[19:47] said you'll bruise I'll bruise your
[19:50] head and you'll bruise my
[19:53] heel foot then you go back to Redemption
[19:56] again we talking about Redemption
[19:58] feet always represents Redemption I'm
[20:00] going to preach a sermon on that I got
[20:02] about 45 pages of notes so I'm going to
[20:04] have to condense them down just a little
[20:06] bit but all the way through the Bible
[20:09] feet represents Redemption well that's
[20:10] the first speaking of redemption what he
[20:12] said was is Satan I'm going to bruise
[20:14] your head you know what that's where you
[20:15] kill something from but if you hit
[20:18] somebody in the hill it's not going to
[20:19] kill them remember what did Jacob Jacob
[20:22] was a limping Prince all right because
[20:25] he was touched in the thigh all right so
[20:27] that showed that his walk was different
[20:29] that's what you and I we've got to see
[20:31] number one that we're either born again
[20:32] or not that's
[20:34] right cuz Redemption is you being born
[20:37] again Redemption is not just you coming
[20:39] to church and not just saying I'm a
[20:40] Christian Redemption is truly that you
[20:43] were like marriage and
[20:45] divorce if your old husband's still
[20:47] alive you can't be married to Christ cuz
[20:50] you're an adulterous you got two
[20:52] husbands you can't do that okay the
[20:55] spiritual part of marriage and divorce
[20:56] is wonderful Jun and I we're talking
[20:57] about today coming up the road the
[21:00] spiritual part of marriage and divorce
[21:01] is wonderful the natural part is not
[21:03] right but you got to see the natural
[21:05] part to see the spiritual part that's
[21:07] true all right that there is hope it's
[21:10] like I was telling brother Mark that
[21:12] marriage and
[21:13] divorce is a concrete steel
[21:18] titanium
[21:20] wall Jesus said from the beginning it
[21:22] wasn't so if you're married today and
[21:25] you've married a woman that's been
[21:26] married again you're living in adultery
[21:29] that's what the Bible
[21:30] says if you're a man today and you're
[21:32] married to a woman that's been married
[21:34] again you're an adultery that's what the
[21:36] Bible says you can't go past what that
[21:38] Bible says right you are committing
[21:40] adultery but then God takes a tablecloth
[21:43] called Grace and he lays it
[21:46] over he makes it
[21:48] softer but that's still under there
[21:51] don't ever get rid of that that's still
[21:53] solid he can't go past what his word
[21:55] says but he does have a blanket of Grace
[21:57] that goes over it that's right this says
[21:59] hey it's like the woman remember that's
[22:01] a very wonderful type of marriage and
[22:04] divorce Jesus was standing there Here
[22:06] Comes three Pharisees and they throw a
[22:08] woman down in front of him and said we
[22:10] caught her in the act of
[22:12] adultery what do you say now he knew
[22:15] what the law said law said kill her
[22:18] right but what did Jesus say in other
[22:22] words he said I didn't see her do it now
[22:24] if he would have seen her do it like
[22:26] Daddy said if he would have seen her
[22:28] he'd had to Stone her cuz he was a
[22:29] witness but when he got rid of her
[22:33] accusers that's what I've always
[22:35] said about
[22:38] Rahab Rahab was a
[22:40] she had had so many men in that
[22:43] City till she was living on the wall up
[22:47] top so she was you know just plain
[22:49] language she she knew her business and
[22:52] she had a lot of
[22:54] clients right
[22:56] right now how could she marryed an
[22:58] Israeli
[22:59] General and her being a and him
[23:03] being an Israeli
[23:04] General and through
[23:08] her come
[23:13] Jesse
[23:15] ohed oh forgot one
[23:19] Boaz
[23:22] David well the Bible plainly
[23:25] says everybody in that city was killed
[23:29] he accept
[23:32] her God did way with her
[23:35] accuser she had no one to accuse her
[23:38] that she was a prostitute cuz they were
[23:40] all dead and that's why you and I need
[23:41] to look at this thing the women in the
[23:43] Bible type me and you even though in the
[23:45] horest condition she was in even at the
[23:47] woman at the well even the one where God
[23:49] where where God was standing there and
[23:51] said
[23:53] woman I didn't see you do
[23:55] it and then he says hey if if you you
[23:58] got a if you don't have a problem you
[24:00] catch the first stone he knew they did
[24:03] he knew they did he discerned their
[24:05] their thoughts he knew they had had
[24:07] things so here we
[24:09] are Jesus said I didn't see you do it
[24:13] but remember here's the
[24:16] key he said your sins are
[24:20] forgiven but don't you ever do it
[24:23] again what June and I were talking about
[24:25] today about marriage and divorce brother
[24:27] R says go on As You Are
[24:29] now going on as you are is not if you
[24:30] were single you get
[24:32] married come on people yeah we don't
[24:36] understand that part that brother R said
[24:37] go on as you are if you're married and
[24:39] in a double marriage if you're that way
[24:41] stay that way he said but if you're
[24:43] single and then you get in a double
[24:44] marriage you're committing adultery
[24:45] sorry that's just the way the Bible is
[24:47] I'm sorry that's the you've lost this
[24:51] part cuz the grace of marriage and
[24:53] divorce is go on as you are and he said
[24:56] God forbid if you ever do it again right
[24:59] that's the grace of marriage and divorce
[25:02] not that you can go out and do what you
[25:03] want to no he said don't do it no more
[25:05] right here go on as you are what the
[25:09] people that were sitting there if they
[25:10] were married they had a Grace if they
[25:13] accepted it but if one if a woman was
[25:16] sitting there and had three living
[25:17] husbands and she was single at the time
[25:19] and then she goes out and gets married
[25:21] that ain't covered on a marriage and
[25:22] divorce she's an adultery she committed
[25:25] adultery all right so that's the same
[25:27] way with this this is getting rid of our
[25:29] old we got rid of our old husband when
[25:30] we were born again he's
[25:33] dead dead right dead not like brother R
[25:38] said put up in the closet now he's dead
[25:40] Peter knew his old husband was
[25:42] dead when he come up to the day of
[25:44] Pentecost and he said men and
[25:47] Brethren this is the Jesus that you
[25:50] crucified and he brought it a 30-minute
[25:52] sermon and those people knew that he was
[25:54] the spokesman he had changed he was
[25:56] different he knew he was changed he knew
[25:58] he was different that's what you and I
[25:59] got to look at with this teaching we got
[26:04] to know that we're different if we're
[26:07] not different we need to start working
[26:08] on it whatever happened to go to the
[26:10] altar we go to the altar now just
[26:12] because we're sick and somebody else has
[26:14] got a problem or like Susan you got a
[26:16] friend with a
[26:19] problem I got this friend watch yourself
[26:21] all of us well that's all we do
[26:24] that where we ever walked up to the
[26:26] Altar and said I just want to repent of
[26:28] what I've done I just want to repent I
[26:31] just that was what I wanted to do I knew
[26:32] I needed to get to church that Wednesday
[26:34] night cuz I needed to repent of what
[26:36] I've done but I wasn't filled with the
[26:38] Holy Ghost then that just chopped off my
[26:40] past sins that just made me feel good
[26:43] well the devil can do
[26:44] that see then I went on with God into
[26:48] sanctification which got rid of all that
[26:50] stuff right and then God filled me with
[26:53] the Holy Ghost cuz he started bringing
[26:55] the word and the word started fitting
[26:56] together not that I put it together he
[26:58] brought brought it right and it started
[26:59] fitting together and and then I began to
[27:02] see that my life had really changed then
[27:05] so that's what we got to see we got to
[27:06] see that our life has changed and then
[27:08] we can start growing up the statue of a
[27:10] perfect man all right so that's why I
[27:12] want you to see again even with brother
[27:13] brandom here he is he's a prophet but he
[27:16] still has to write things down he still
[27:18] has to remember things he still has to
[27:20] ask God to do things for him he's not
[27:22] some automatic even I'm like Daddy Jesus
[27:25] when he got up in the morning I don't
[27:26] think he said no I got to act like God
[27:27] today no it was Jesus that's right it
[27:30] was
[27:32] Jesus but when something would come he
[27:35] said the prince of this world come has
[27:36] nothing to me well when he would
[27:39] come where you and I were born in sin
[27:42] shapen in iniquity and have this old
[27:43] nature that we got to get rid of you say
[27:46] well that Nature's got to die sure but
[27:48] there's still that Spirit part of you
[27:50] that's right memory reason conscious F
[27:52] and Imagination that's where these
[27:54] things that's right take care of
[27:56] that everybody understand that your soul
[27:59] right now if you're born
[28:00] again listen already has that that's
[28:05] right already has love cuz that's what
[28:08] that's what that love is that love is
[28:09] not just me loving my wife now that's
[28:11] Christ loving us so much that he died
[28:13] for us and we accepted it and he gave us
[28:15] his life everybody got there the Holy
[28:18] Ghost you got inside you has that love
[28:21] has that brotherly kindness what checks
[28:24] you now if you're born again what checks
[28:26] you when you're almost doing something
[28:28] wrong or have a bad thought or getting
[28:30] ready to do something what checks you
[28:31] now that it used to
[28:33] not so used to I would say bad words and
[28:36] I just say it cuz that was me that was
[28:38] my nature but when I got a nature change
[28:40] I told you many times before I was
[28:41] talking to a guy you know probably a
[28:44] year after I I'd come back to the Lord
[28:47] and and the word come in my almost
[28:51] come out of my mouth but when I almost
[28:52] said that it felt like somebody hit me
[28:55] right here in the chest and all the air
[28:57] went
[28:58] out of my mouth and the guy I was on the
[29:00] phone with it Ken I was talking to Ken
[29:02] my old hunting buddy and he said what
[29:05] happened CU he heard me go cuz I was
[29:08] getting ready to
[29:09] say he ain't worth them you know and it
[29:13] never came out he said what happened I
[29:15] said well I started to say a word and I
[29:18] shouldn't and of course he never made
[29:20] any mention to that but after that we
[29:23] just kept on talking but that was where
[29:24] God protected me he was keeping me from
[29:27] doing that I wasn't I had it in my brain
[29:30] and it was getting ready to come out of
[29:31] my
[29:33] mouth you say oh no no we brother
[29:36] brandom even says I have to watch what I
[29:38] say see it may not have been a bad word
[29:40] but what if he said something a little
[29:42] different see he's a he was a prophet
[29:44] God had to remember even he did one time
[29:47] he took a scripture right and the seals
[29:50] in the questions and answerers on the
[29:51] seals he took a scripture and answered
[29:52] it
[29:54] wrong what' he do that
[29:58] knowledge in the
[30:00] pyramid remember he stopped and he said
[30:02] is there something wrong something's
[30:03] going on something's happening what
[30:05] happens somebody get sick what he felt
[30:07] something something strange I've done
[30:10] that a few times in my life you feel
[30:11] something strange going to happen or
[30:13] fixing to happen or and you know what I
[30:15] do I just start praying you know I just
[30:18] say God you know whatever it is stop it
[30:20] you know or whoever it is just just
[30:22] start praying for him but that knowledge
[30:26] that he had knew there was something
[30:29] wrong so you know what he didn't just
[30:30] continue on and say bless God I know I'm
[30:32] right no and this was at the opening of
[30:35] the seals he says no stop and somebody
[30:39] said read your scripture over again cuz
[30:43] that brother saw that the scripture was
[30:45] the way it was supposed to be well see
[30:48] that was God showing us and the prophet
[30:51] he said look at there he said something
[30:54] about he's here or he W he wouldn't let
[30:56] me answer that wrong or continue on well
[30:59] that's the way with you and I sure
[31:00] there's things we do wrong we're
[31:03] human and and thoughts are the worst yes
[31:06] you can't help the the old thoughts that
[31:08] you had
[31:09] before but the problem with before was
[31:13] we dwelled on
[31:15] them we manifested our thoughts that's
[31:19] right right now if you manifest your
[31:22] thoughts now and they're the same ones
[31:23] you have you're not born again you need
[31:25] the
[31:26] Lord cuz but if you're still cussing and
[31:29] all kind of stuff like that you ain't
[31:30] got the Holy Ghost I'm sorry that goes
[31:32] out at sanctification not at the new
[31:34] birth got it yes all right so you know
[31:38] if you are just say born again if you
[31:39] don't want to come to church every
[31:40] Sunday if you want don't want to desire
[31:42] to be around Christians you need to do
[31:44] something you you need to go to the
[31:46] Altar and repent start over again God
[31:49] don't
[31:50] care you understand he don't you know
[31:52] why I'm saying you don't care he don't
[31:54] care if you go to the Altar and say God
[31:56] I know I'm not born again save me he he
[32:00] don't mind that I don't want to use that
[32:01] word care God cares about everything but
[32:03] but I mean it's not going to make him
[32:05] nervous not going to make him
[32:08] upset he's just showing you where you
[32:11] are and thank God a father will show you
[32:14] where you're at amen that's what that's
[32:16] why brother R said you can see where
[32:17] you're at at any time why because God is
[32:21] telling you that's right he knows where
[32:24] you're at you don't but when he said
[32:26] when you come to a keep point in your
[32:28] life cuz remember this is just life
[32:30] lesson when you come to a key point in
[32:32] your life and something drops in and
[32:35] it's different than what it was before
[32:38] and it's better makes you a better not a
[32:40] better person but makes you a better
[32:41] Christian makes you think different act
[32:44] different then you know one thing for
[32:46] sure God's leading you cuz the devil's
[32:48] not going to do that that's right
[32:49] exactly now when you come into the into
[32:52] the into the the the faith of God and
[32:56] the new birth that's that's God that's
[32:58] not the devil that's God the devil don't
[33:01] have nothing to do with he don't want
[33:02] you to do that now he wants you to feel
[33:04] kind of religious though yes and do
[33:06] religious things that's true but God
[33:08] wants you to walk you to Virtue walk you
[33:10] to knowledge and somewhere you know what
[33:11] he'll do that that's true he'll bring
[33:14] something in your life to where where
[33:15] somebody will come to
[33:18] you and say
[33:20] hey what do I need to do about a
[33:22] situation you say well that's just life
[33:24] lessons that's virtue they came to you
[33:26] for some reason
[33:29] they came to you for some reason it
[33:31] wasn't just because you were somebody
[33:33] I'm not going to go to a drunk and find
[33:35] out how to be a Christian
[33:38] right okay yes and even a even a spirit
[33:42] baby in Christ can help you but that
[33:44] person is got to grow with you he's got
[33:46] to grow up that's why we have a uh you
[33:49] know Elders in the church that don't
[33:53] even have to be preachers they're just
[33:54] Elders they're they're people that stand
[33:56] in a position that you know that
[33:58] person's been through it and he can help
[34:01] you or she can help you if you'll just
[34:04] listen to them you just listen they'll
[34:07] help you all right that's why that I
[34:12] we're on the internet I don't care
[34:13] anything about young pastors
[34:17] sorry these little young guys that start
[34:19] out 22 and 25 and 30 year old pastoring
[34:22] churches sorry I just ain't got a lot I
[34:25] just ain't got a lot for that I want
[34:27] somebody that's seasoned and solid and
[34:29] been through something and and you know
[34:32] I want somebody that's Rock Solid you
[34:34] know cuz it's my soul on the line not
[34:37] whether I like the guy or whether he's
[34:39] oh he's young he can do
[34:42] things athletes are young and they can
[34:44] do things what do the matter you know I
[34:46] mean what are you comparing I want to
[34:48] hear the word of God and have some
[34:49] wisdom behind
[34:51] it see I was telling somebody the other
[34:53] day and and this is my fault that I have
[34:58] I was talking to Donnie the other day
[34:59] and and and we were talking about
[35:01] something and I said now if I would be
[35:03] preaching marriage and divorce right now
[35:05] most of you would be mad at me the way I
[35:08] bring it but Daddy brings it in such a
[35:11] way to where he's bringing it the same
[35:13] way I
[35:14] would but it's got a whole lot of Sav on
[35:17] it it's got a lot of nurturing but see
[35:20] that's his growth development that's his
[35:22] position in God that God is able to give
[35:25] it to me and you right not soft soap it
[35:29] now he don't soft soap it but he brings
[35:32] it in a way that it don't make you mad
[35:35] see that's where I got to grow because I
[35:36] would bring it and if I preach marriage
[35:37] and divorce we'd all going to
[35:39] help all of
[35:41] us but there's that blanket of Grace and
[35:44] there's somebody that can stand and do
[35:46] that and I appreciate being with a
[35:50] pastor that even with my dad or not
[35:51] being my dad he's a pastor enough to
[35:53] where that he can bring things that
[35:55] sometimes the internet people seems they
[35:57] they think oh hard well he is hard but
[35:59] he brings it in a way to where you just
[36:00] love him for doing it that's right well
[36:02] see that's God that's not the devil the
[36:04] devil would want you to get mad the
[36:07] devil would want you to stay at home and
[36:09] not listen and fuss and argue now that's
[36:12] what he wants but see God will bringing
[36:13] in a way to where we all go hey like
[36:16] brother Mark said he said man everybody
[36:17] was kind of somber Sunday said nobody
[36:19] was saying amen or hard I said you know
[36:21] what I said because they hit home that's
[36:23] right to every one of us cuz he's
[36:25] talking about this guy right now
[36:28] but once we see this guy can be redeemed
[36:31] and is redeemable which it is there's
[36:33] that blanket it is it is hard but once
[36:37] God throws that Grace on it it makes it
[36:39] a lot easier let's go upstairs see you
[36:42] next
[36:42] Sunday think on these things
[36:52] [Music]
