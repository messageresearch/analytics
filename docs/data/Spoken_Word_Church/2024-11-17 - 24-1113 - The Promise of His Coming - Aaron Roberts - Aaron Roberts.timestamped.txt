[5:27] amen amen second Peter chapter 3 we're
[5:30] going to begin at verse
[5:41] one and T tonight I want to title
[5:44] this the promise of his
[5:48] coming
[5:50] and begin at uh second Peter 3 begin at
[5:54] verse
[5:55] one and it says this Second Epistle
[5:58] beloved I now write unto you and both
[6:01] which I stir up your pure Minds in a way
[6:03] by way of remembrance that you may be
[6:06] mindful of The Words which were spoken
[6:08] before by the holy prophets and of the
[6:10] Commandment of us the Apostles of the
[6:12] Lord and Savior knowing this first that
[6:16] there shall come in the last day
[6:17] scoffers walking after their own lust
[6:20] and saying where is the promise of his
[6:22] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[6:25] all things continue as they were from
[6:27] the beginning of the creation for this
[6:30] they are willingly they willingly are
[6:32] ignorant of that by the word of God the
[6:36] heavens were of old and the Earth
[6:37] standing out of the water and in the
[6:39] water whereby the world that was that
[6:43] then was being overflowed with water
[6:45] perished but the heavens and the Earth
[6:47] which are now by the same word are kept
[6:50] in store reserved un fire against the
[6:52] day of judgment and the predition of
[6:54] ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant
[6:57] of this one thing that one day is with
[6:59] one day is with the Lord as a thousand
[7:02] years and a thousand years as one day
[7:04] the Lord is not slack concerning his
[7:06] promise as some men count slackness but
[7:09] is longsuffering to us word not willing
[7:11] that any should perish but that all
[7:14] should should come to repentance but the
[7:17] day of the Lord will come as a thief in
[7:20] the night in the heavens which shall
[7:22] pass away with a great noise and the
[7:24] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[7:27] the Earth also and the works that are
[7:30] therein shall be burned up amen God
[7:33] bless you you may be seated
[7:36] tonight and U I just want to look at
[7:38] this little
[7:41] thought the promise of his coming and
[7:44] one of the things I was I was looking at
[7:46] was the you know Peter's writing here
[7:49] and and one of the things that he was
[7:51] talking about was the scoffers in the
[7:54] last
[7:55] days and we see the condition that the
[7:59] world is in and um I really enjoyed what
[8:02] brother Bob had to say uh Sunday and it
[8:06] was really it was really good and uh
[8:08] really blessed me and but you know you
[8:11] look at the condition that the world is
[8:12] in today and you know it's now is the
[8:15] time for people to check up to see where
[8:17] they are just like brother Bob was
[8:19] saying you know Now's the Time because
[8:21] people have gotten to the place where
[8:23] they really don't realize the condition
[8:26] and the hour that the condition they're
[8:29] in but they don't realize the hour in
[8:30] which they're living and they don't and
[8:33] so you know as as he was talking about
[8:35] you know people just kind of they just
[8:37] kind of float along or whatever but they
[8:39] don't realize the the seriousness the
[8:41] lateness of the hour and you know so
[8:44] here's here's
[8:46] uh Peter writing you know he he's
[8:48] writing
[8:50] about the the word that's been given and
[8:53] he says I want to stir up your pure
[8:54] Minds in a way of remembrance and he was
[8:56] talking about the word that they had
[8:58] been given but also going back to the
[9:00] Old Testament what the prophets had
[9:02] spoken and looking back at what was what
[9:05] had been already spoken but he wanted to
[9:07] bring this back and see all of this had
[9:11] taken place we knew how the how the
[9:13] scripture had come but then he was
[9:15] saying that you see the the word has
[9:17] went forth but he said knowing first
[9:19] that the in the last days scoffers shall
[9:21] come walking after their own lust and so
[9:24] we realize you know this is the day that
[9:26] an hour in which we live we're living in
[9:28] that day
[9:29] and so today is the day that you know
[9:32] it's it's a glorious time to live in
[9:34] because the scripture was written for
[9:36] this day the day and hour in which we
[9:40] live is the Glorious Day because you
[9:42] know you think about all of the prophets
[9:44] that had written all the things that
[9:47] Isaiah and Jeremiah and all the prophets
[9:49] had written about all the things that
[9:50] that Paul and Peter and all of all the
[9:53] apostles and the different ones had
[9:54] spoke about that's our day amen and you
[9:57] know what a wonderful time to realize
[9:59] that
[9:59] this is this is the culmination of the
[10:02] plan of God and we're living in the
[10:03] midst of it and sometimes we fail to
[10:05] realize just how great a a day that
[10:08] we're living in and what a serious day
[10:10] that we're living in and what a what a u
[10:14] a responsibility has been given to us
[10:16] what an obligation has been given to us
[10:18] because we are the ones that's to carry
[10:20] this
[10:21] on all this has come to our day right
[10:24] and you know it's a wonderful
[10:26] thing to realize that
[10:30] God called you and I for this day God
[10:33] called us for the for this day this is
[10:36] this is the day you know brother bam
[10:37] said you know he said if if I could pick
[10:40] a day an hour in which to live he said I
[10:42] would want to live in this
[10:44] day and you know you know as brother R
[10:46] was talking about you know people say oh
[10:48] I want to live in Bible days you can't
[10:50] get any more in the Bible today than the
[10:52] day that you're living in because this
[10:55] is the day and hour which the Bible is
[10:57] being fulfilled and it's coming to an
[11:00] end and we're see because if you can't
[11:03] see the day and hour and realize this is
[11:06] the end of the Gentile dispensation
[11:08] because God is finishing with the
[11:10] Gentiles and he will soon turn to the
[11:12] Jews and bring them their message this
[11:14] is the day and it's a glorious day to
[11:16] live in but it's also a fearful day it's
[11:19] a dreadful day because people don't
[11:20] realize the day and hour in which they
[11:23] live but you know as he was talking
[11:25] about he said you see the scoffers would
[11:28] be in the last days brother BR was
[11:31] speaking here in the Rapture he was
[11:32] talking about the prophets he said see
[11:34] Peter was speaking of the he said in the
[11:37] last days these scoffers would come
[11:38] saying these things see it's predicted
[11:41] the reason the people are acting today
[11:43] the way they're acting he said why you
[11:46] certainly are expecting it because the
[11:48] Bible said that in the last days they'd
[11:50] be heady high-minded lovers of Pleasures
[11:52] more than lovers of God truce Breakers
[11:54] false accusers incontinent despisers of
[11:56] those that are good having a form of
[11:58] godliness and denying the power thereof
[12:00] from such turn away he said can we look
[12:04] for an impersonation of Truth
[12:06] certainly because that is the day that
[12:09] hour in which we live that you see that
[12:11] everybody has take they've heard the
[12:13] word and they they've taken the word of
[12:15] God but they've made it a none effect
[12:17] and that was that was the whole point
[12:19] all the way through but we see how this
[12:21] is the day and hour which we live and
[12:24] then as they were speaking here the as
[12:28] the scoffers would say they would say
[12:30] where is the promise of his coming where
[12:32] is where is the promise of the word that
[12:34] was given and he said because they said
[12:36] well since our fathers fell asleep all
[12:38] things continue as they were from the
[12:41] beginning and it's just a continuation
[12:44] on of the same thing and you brother
[12:46] Bram was talking of you know the the
[12:48] people that have that heard the the
[12:50] scripture and you know he was talking
[12:52] about the man that you know talking
[12:55] about the you know Jesus didn't die on
[12:57] the cross and you know he had he had a
[12:59] deal worked out with pilot and you know
[13:02] all these type things that they they
[13:03] just try to sew these seeds in and try
[13:06] to tell people that you know the
[13:07] scripture is not right you know there's
[13:09] all all these little things that are
[13:11] that were said that didn't make any
[13:13] sense but he said see that that's what
[13:15] the critics are supposed to do he said
[13:17] that's the day in which we're living He
[13:19] said they were scoffers that he said
[13:21] that's the day to fulfill the prophecy
[13:23] all those things that were taking place
[13:25] that that he was talking about those
[13:27] were fulfilling the prophecy of the day
[13:31] scoffers in the last days he said he
[13:34] said see they they take the scripture
[13:35] and he said there's no difference in the
[13:37] time than what it was he said when our
[13:39] fathers fell asleep he said but you can
[13:42] see these things begin to happen he said
[13:44] raise up your head get ready something
[13:46] could happen at any time Christ come for
[13:48] his church so you see these things that
[13:51] are taking place why because this is an
[13:52] end time sign that you're going to see
[13:55] these things taking place and people are
[13:57] looking and they wondering why
[13:59] you know they say well we're looking for
[14:01] the Fulfillment of the scripture we're
[14:02] trying to understand well you know what
[14:04] one of the fulfillments of the scripture
[14:06] is when scoffers come because brother BR
[14:08] said the scoffers coming and saying
[14:10] where is the where is the the promise of
[14:12] his coming and they're turning down the
[14:14] word and he said that is a fulfilling of
[14:17] the scriptures so you're seeing a
[14:19] fulfillment of the scripture he said the
[14:21] people don't realize that doing these
[14:22] things and saying these things they're
[14:24] fulfilling the scriptures you see the
[14:27] thing is one day because you you and I
[14:30] all of us are going to fulfill some part
[14:32] of the scripture there's going to be a a
[14:34] scripture that you're going to fulfill
[14:36] because you're either going to believe
[14:37] the word you're going to walk in the
[14:38] word you're going to make the word
[14:39] manifest or you're going to deny the
[14:41] word and fall and and be left behind
[14:45] because only those that are walking in
[14:47] the light are going to walk in the word
[14:48] going to walk and be changed by the word
[14:50] are going to make a Rapture because
[14:52] that's what's promised for them but the
[14:55] other ones if they do not follow the
[14:57] word if they deny the word and it only
[14:59] takes just a little bit because if Eve
[15:03] only fell on one word then how much more
[15:05] because you've got to follow all of the
[15:07] words you got to have all the word and
[15:08] walk in the fullness of the word and
[15:11] walk in what God has called you to but
[15:14] the other thing that's required is
[15:15] you've got to have a desire for the word
[15:17] because if you've got the Holy Ghost
[15:19] inside of you then it desires the word
[15:22] right and it desires for you to be drawn
[15:24] to the word and so you're going to walk
[15:26] in that and and even if you don't
[15:28] understand the word word right because
[15:31] you know it it takes it's a growth as
[15:33] brother PA was talking about you know
[15:34] it's a growth that you've got to grow in
[15:36] this thing but if you don't if you don't
[15:38] continue in it that you're not ever
[15:40] going to grow right and so you know it's
[15:42] not you know just you just something
[15:44] that you fall into you know because
[15:46] there's some there's a growth that takes
[15:47] place and there's an overcoming that
[15:49] takes place and you've got to continue
[15:51] in that right that's
[15:55] right and see how even
[16:00] in the days of of Jesus when you see how
[16:03] you know he was talking about chaus and
[16:06] and the different ones see you know they
[16:07] they were there listening and they
[16:09] actually seen the word made flesh for
[16:11] their day and they stood there and he
[16:13] said they turned the word down they
[16:15] scoffed at the word that was made flesh
[16:17] before them they had heard the word they
[16:19] had seen the word and they scoffed it
[16:20] and he said they were standing in the
[16:22] temple when the when the crucifixion was
[16:26] taking place and they're standing in the
[16:27] temple singing my God my God why hast
[16:30] Thou forsaken me and there he was
[16:32] hanging on the cross fulfilling the
[16:34] scripture that they're singing about and
[16:36] not realizing that they're living in the
[16:38] midst of the day of the Fulfillment of
[16:40] the word and they're missing that and he
[16:44] said see this because he said it was
[16:47] predicted for the by the scriptures for
[16:49] them to be
[16:50] blind because it was it was the time and
[16:53] see it's the same thing happening today
[16:55] is people are walking in the midst and
[16:57] being blind bited
[16:59] being standing in the midst of the word
[17:01] and the midst and the word going forth
[17:03] from from the the ministry and and you
[17:07] you're hearing the word and you're not
[17:08] catching the word amen and not and not
[17:11] realizing it's the word for you it's
[17:13] what you have to receive the word you
[17:16] brother R was speaking of there when he
[17:18] was when he was speaking of of Noah's
[17:20] day and he was talking about Noah
[17:22] ministering and you know the the the
[17:25] Earth the world had come under judgment
[17:28] and it was a there was a judgment went
[17:30] forth and listen they were under a death
[17:32] sentence and they would there was no way
[17:34] out there was everybody listen you're
[17:37] going to face this there's no other way
[17:40] right but God made a way of Escape God
[17:44] made a way for them to to pass by that
[17:47] but there was only one way made and so
[17:50] when when Noah had this had this because
[17:52] God seen the wickedness of man and he
[17:54] said he was going to destroy the Earth
[17:56] and he was going to destroy all of the
[17:57] works that took that that was there in
[18:00] and he when he gave Noah the message and
[18:01] he said listen he said now you got to
[18:03] build an
[18:04] ark and and he began to talk you know
[18:07] tell Noah about these things but you
[18:09] know he was talking about the the age in
[18:12] which Noah was living was such a great
[18:15] scientific age and you know they had
[18:17] seen all of the things and they had such
[18:19] great scientific knowledge and all that
[18:21] you know they they could shoot this into
[18:23] the skies and they were there and they
[18:24] could prove that there was no moisture
[18:26] in the air and you know how brother R
[18:29] said how God he uh watered the Earth by
[18:32] the uh irrigation and all of that and
[18:34] there was no water that ever came the
[18:36] the Springs watered the Earth and you
[18:38] know there never was anything like this
[18:40] before and here he is Noah comes out
[18:43] here this crazy man comes out and tells
[18:44] them listen the Earth is going to rain
[18:47] there's coming a
[18:49] destruction well you know what nobody
[18:51] ever heard anything like this
[18:53] before I mean this this is a total new
[18:56] message and we got this crazy man out
[18:57] here and he's going to build this huge
[19:00] boat you know and he's going he's going
[19:02] to put all these animals in it and he's
[19:04] like you know and and and you know how
[19:06] we know that he went on all those 120
[19:08] years of him preaching to his generation
[19:11] to tell them listen you're under
[19:13] judgment and there's only one way out
[19:16] and that's God's way there's no other
[19:17] way that you're going to escape this and
[19:19] you know and as he began to preach and
[19:23] he began to put his faith in action and
[19:25] started building what God told him to do
[19:27] was build that Ark and and he began to
[19:29] build that and you know every time as we
[19:32] we've many times have been dramatized
[19:34] but you know here they are they come by
[19:36] and all they saying is Noah building on
[19:38] an ark and keeps preaching the exact
[19:40] same thing you're under judgment you're
[19:42] under judgment are you going to are you
[19:43] going to accept God's way of Escape or
[19:46] you going to live or you going to face
[19:47] this judgment and you know they keep he
[19:49] was out there building and every time
[19:50] you came by it's the exact same thing
[19:52] you know you got to repent or perish you
[19:55] got to get ready you know he kept going
[19:57] through all of that you know he lived in
[19:58] that great that great scientific day in
[20:01] which he lived and all the things that
[20:03] he had seen well you know they were
[20:05] there there was nothing scientific that
[20:08] could prove what Noah said there was
[20:10] nothing that give them any any reason to
[20:14] believe anything that Noah said that's
[20:16] right there was nothing that was given
[20:18] but they still Noah preached that
[20:21] message and he stood right there and he
[20:23] began to preach that the whole time
[20:25] listen God's going to send rain the
[20:27] water's coming from the sky and it's
[20:29] like well how is this going to take
[20:31] place he's like there I mean there's no
[20:34] scientific way there's I mean you know
[20:36] please explain that well all I know is
[20:39] God said so that's all I got is God said
[20:42] so because God can do whatever he wants
[20:44] to right and it's like well but they
[20:47] couldn't believe that it had never
[20:49] rained and and you know all those type
[20:51] things but he said listen it's going to
[20:52] rain going to destroy the Earth he said
[20:55] now you got to get ready he said because
[20:57] in all of this you've got to get ready
[20:59] there's only one way and so Noah had his
[21:03] in had his instructions and he began to
[21:06] build all those things and you know as
[21:09] the generations came along you had one
[21:12] that was standing there and and dad made
[21:15] fun of it it's like hey let's go by and
[21:17] see the see the crazy man and Noah's out
[21:20] there building this Ark well you know
[21:21] his sons were out there helping him and
[21:22] you know but he spent all of those years
[21:24] building that and you know and then it
[21:26] was just like well you know the son
[21:28] comes along and he's like I following
[21:30] Daddy's footsteps and it's like hey
[21:33] how's it going up there building your
[21:35] Ark and you know have you seen any rain
[21:39] yet we ain't seen any
[21:43] clouds but you know he kept pray but you
[21:45] know he kept preaching the same thing
[21:47] and you know no doubt he had a lot of
[21:49] people that just you know out ridicule
[21:51] him the whole time about what he was
[21:53] doing but you know it never deterred
[21:54] Noah from what he was what he was
[21:56] preaching it never deterred no from
[21:59] fulfilling the word of God he just
[22:00] continued in building that Ark and
[22:03] following the word of God but you know
[22:05] there was only there were a certain
[22:07] group in that you know they only got to
[22:10] the place where they stood around and
[22:12] listened right you know there was only
[22:15] there was a group that actually sat
[22:16] there and listened to
[22:18] Noah and they were listening to his
[22:21] message and he's out there saying listen
[22:23] you're under you're under the
[22:25] death you know you're going to die if
[22:28] you don't take if you don't accept this
[22:30] and you know here they are you know
[22:32] you're under a death sentence well you
[22:33] know they they just sit there and listen
[22:35] to them yeah but it never got them on
[22:39] the ark you know there was some that
[22:41] listen well there was a lot of them that
[22:42] didn't listen to any of it they just
[22:44] well you know he you know he's just full
[22:46] of it and you know we just let the let
[22:48] the crazies go and you w not worried
[22:50] about it but you know there was some
[22:51] people that that got halfway interested
[22:54] in what he had to say but the problem
[22:56] was it never got to the place where they
[22:58] actually were sold out to the place they
[23:00] actually got on the ark you know that's
[23:03] like well you know I don't I just want
[23:04] to hang around close enough that maybe I
[23:07] can get on maybe there but you know God
[23:10] said listen you've got to get on the ark
[23:12] when the doors open there's only one
[23:14] time that you're going to be able to get
[23:15] on that and it's when the door is open
[23:17] when the Call's made because when Noah
[23:20] built the ark and he started to call the
[23:22] animals and put the animals and he began
[23:24] to get everything set for for this
[23:28] happening to take place for the flood to
[23:30] take place when this began to happen you
[23:32] know it's so amazing that people began
[23:34] to see the signs and wonders and it
[23:36] still didn't move them to the place
[23:38] where they actually received the word
[23:40] right right that's right well how many
[23:43] other people can see the the animals all
[23:45] these animals lining up walking up on
[23:47] the
[23:48] ark well I'm sure that that Drew a crowd
[23:51] that people wanted to see the the
[23:53] spectacle but you know what it still
[23:55] didn't change their heart it still
[23:57] didn't move them to the place where they
[23:59] actually decided you know what there's
[24:00] something going on here right but you
[24:03] know here they are on standing on the
[24:05] outside looking but you know when when
[24:07] God told Noah when he got all the AR the
[24:09] animals on the ark when he got
[24:11] everything set for the for this passage
[24:14] that he closed the door and it was
[24:16] sealed right and people didn't realize
[24:18] that their destination had already been
[24:21] sealed their judgment had already been
[24:23] sealed but those that had received the
[24:25] word had already got on the ark and they
[24:27] were sealed in away from the
[24:31] Judgment but there was a group that was
[24:33] on the outside well they were just
[24:34] standing there listening and they
[24:36] thought well we just maybe maybe there's
[24:38] another way no there's not another way
[24:41] that's right you're not going to get a
[24:43] second
[24:44] chance right because when they when they
[24:47] were sealed out that was it and you know
[24:50] there was lots of them that were trying
[24:52] to get in when the rain started falling
[24:54] oh hey look it's the manifestation that
[24:56] Noah talked about all these years yeah
[24:59] you know here's here's granddaddy was
[25:01] out talking about it Daddy was talking
[25:02] about it and all the other ones been
[25:03] talking about it all of a sudden hey
[25:05] guess what it's coming to
[25:07] pass but by the time they realized that
[25:10] the Judgment had started to fall they
[25:12] were sealed out their Doom had already
[25:14] been sealed right why because they
[25:16] missed they missed their opportunity to
[25:18] to bypass that amen and they there you
[25:21] know they trying to get the door open
[25:23] and Noah was like listen I didn't close
[25:25] the door I didn't seal the door God did
[25:28] am he was the one that made the way he
[25:31] opened the door for all of you and when
[25:33] he got done he closed the door and it
[25:35] was sealed and your judgment was sealed
[25:37] right amen and it's the same way today
[25:39] God made the has made a way and he's
[25:41] made an opening and he calls to us but
[25:44] the problem is if you don't do that if
[25:46] you don't accept the day and hour which
[25:48] you live and when when the door is
[25:50] opening you don't know when the door is
[25:52] going to be closed we don't know when
[25:54] our time's going to be over with but the
[25:56] thing is is if you miss your opportunity
[25:58] then don't expect to have another
[26:00] opportunity because you've missed your
[26:02] day cuz today is the day of salvation
[26:04] you don't get another
[26:06] chance you've only get one
[26:09] time amen amen now God go because if
[26:14] brother R said if God calls a man one
[26:16] time you know he's just in what he's
[26:18] done and it doesn't matter if you're 12
[26:21] years old it doesn't matter if you're 14
[26:23] years old it don't matter if you're a
[26:25] hundred years old it because if God
[26:27] calls you and makes it known to you and
[26:29] you don't accept it then that's your
[26:31] judgment but you've got to call when the
[26:33] day and mult you know the Lord may call
[26:35] multiple
[26:37] times for you to come and that's the
[26:40] grace of God that he calls that he
[26:43] continues to call but you've got to
[26:44] accept that right
[26:48] amen see brother said see it it
[26:51] destroyed the word The World God sent
[26:54] the
[26:55] water just the way he said why it was
[26:57] the word word of God said so he said
[27:00] science drowned and perished he said
[27:03] look the very thing that saved Noah
[27:05] killed his critics did you know that the
[27:07] very water if there had been no water
[27:10] Noah couldn't have been saved the ark
[27:11] was the one that floated so the very
[27:14] thing that floated the ark drowned the
[27:16] critic and he said the very Holy Spirit
[27:19] today that people are making fun of it
[27:22] will save the church and condemn the
[27:23] critic and the very same thing the very
[27:26] same thing what saves
[27:29] kills what saves the believer condemns
[27:31] the UN
[27:32] unbeliever that's right so you see have
[27:35] faith in God's word that's one thing
[27:37] that you can stand on and know it's
[27:38] certain what God says it's certain just
[27:41] believe it
[27:43] right so we see how the the word had
[27:47] went forth and it made it so it carried
[27:49] over
[27:52] what Noah it it brought him through but
[27:56] you see here in the last days of people
[27:57] that are stand there and they're saying
[27:59] well you know where is the sign of his
[28:02] coming because they don't realize that
[28:04] the Judgment has already came and they
[28:06] said well everything continues as it was
[28:08] well it didn't continue as it was
[28:10] because there was already one group that
[28:12] came and had a way of Escape made the
[28:15] Judgment had come to them and they
[28:17] didn't accept it there was a group that
[28:18] accepted that judge the the Salvation
[28:21] that came in their day but there was a
[28:23] group that didn't and it continues on
[28:26] today and just like brother BR was
[28:27] talking about you see the the world you
[28:30] know Noah and his family went on the ark
[28:32] but you know when it when man came off
[28:35] because of the wickedness of their heart
[28:36] when they came off the ark you know what
[28:38] it went right back to the same way they
[28:40] were doing the exact same thing they
[28:42] went man what went right back to the
[28:45] same way that he was doing before he got
[28:48] because God spoke to them and drove them
[28:50] in but you know what in time they went
[28:51] right back away from God he began to you
[28:53] began to deal with them but you know
[28:54] what they went right back to their same
[28:56] old ways and he had made a for them and
[29:00] see because brother talking about the
[29:02] the the world you know it washed away
[29:04] all of the all the things that were on
[29:06] the Earth all of the the creation all
[29:09] the things that man had built and all of
[29:11] the all of the the humans that that were
[29:15] here all that was gone but when they
[29:17] came back you know what they went right
[29:18] back to building the same thing doing
[29:20] the same thing and got away from it what
[29:22] God had brought them to and trying to
[29:24] show them and he said why because you
[29:25] know that wasn't a change that took
[29:28] place but it was showing God was showing
[29:30] what was what was coming what was taking
[29:33] place and see so you you come right back
[29:34] to these things and people say you know
[29:37] when you're when you're looking at um
[29:41] justification because you know Ty the
[29:43] typing of the the washing of the Earth
[29:45] was was a type of justification he was
[29:47] like you know see it doesn't do away
[29:48] with with that in with that uh inner man
[29:53] because you know you still have the same
[29:54] desires that you had
[29:56] before but you you know there's a
[29:58] because God draws you and he brings you
[30:01] to a place and you accept what God does
[30:03] and you know then by justification by
[30:05] accepting repentance for your sins then
[30:08] you can be then you're baptized but that
[30:10] doesn't change who you are that's right
[30:13] but you know because you still have the
[30:15] same desires you're still fighting the
[30:16] same thing the same way that the Earth
[30:18] was going through and you you see how
[30:20] these things are but see you're still
[30:21] fighting those things but you know it
[30:23] still but God began to
[30:25] work through the through the things that
[30:28] were taking place in the earth and you
[30:30] you see how the the Earth was was
[30:34] flooded the the brother called at the
[30:36] baptism but you see how these things
[30:38] take place but you know people don't see
[30:40] that there was something that was taking
[30:42] place and you know there became a a a
[30:45] change that was taking place and you
[30:46] know when when Jesus came when the when
[30:49] the when the prophets began to speak and
[30:51] all all the way down through time you
[30:53] know God began to deal with man and he
[30:55] began to open it you know reveal himself
[30:57] to men and began to express himself and
[31:00] all the things that all the prophets
[31:01] began to do and began to speak they
[31:03] began to see
[31:05] God sometimes they didn't realize that's
[31:07] who it was but you know it was it was
[31:09] God in the prophets it was God in Moses
[31:12] it was God in in Isaiah it was God and
[31:15] Jeremiah when they and God and David
[31:16] began to speak to the people and began
[31:18] to show themselves but you know people
[31:20] didn't catch the the opening of the word
[31:23] they didn't catch God's manifestation in
[31:25] their day some people did but some
[31:27] didn't that's right but you know he
[31:29] began to began to open himself up and
[31:31] began to manifest and and he be and
[31:33] began to from the beginning you know he
[31:35] began to talk about what was going to
[31:37] take place and here he is how he was
[31:39] going to come and he was going to bridge
[31:41] the gap back with
[31:43] man and you know he all the promise that
[31:46] came of a messiah and all that and you
[31:48] know here when Jesus came as the
[31:50] Fulfillment of the word and he began to
[31:52] walk the earth and he began to preach
[31:54] the word the word that he preached was a
[31:56] claiming of the believer of the word
[31:59] came forth he began to claim what was
[32:02] what was lost he began to preach to the
[32:04] people because that was a word that was
[32:05] going forth that he was going to fulfill
[32:07] what was promised and he said because he
[32:10] began to speak and when he began to
[32:12] speak he was setting things in order for
[32:15] a group of Believers to come to the
[32:17] place that he wanted them to come to
[32:19] amen because you know he couldn't he
[32:21] couldn't do that in the Old Testament
[32:22] but there was a time that came when he
[32:24] began to manifest himself that he began
[32:27] to showed to the people what he wanted
[32:29] to do what the scripture had to say what
[32:32] was the Fulfillment of the scripture for
[32:34] that day and you know many people they
[32:36] held on to the Old Testament and began
[32:38] to see but they didn't see that when
[32:40] Jesus began to preach he began to take
[32:43] the things from the Old Testament and
[32:44] began to open them up for the day and
[32:47] show them the day and hour which they
[32:48] were living that he was the Fulfillment
[32:51] of what the prophets had said the things
[32:53] that had David had said and he began to
[32:55] show them this is the day amen amen and
[32:59] you know here he is and he began to
[33:00] preach and he began to tell them listen
[33:02] you know there is a kingdom he was
[33:04] setting up a kingdom that that there was
[33:06] going to be a kingdom it was going to be
[33:07] an eternal Kingdom but it was not in the
[33:10] same way that the disciples thought it
[33:11] was going to be it was not going to be
[33:13] this Earthly Kingdom he's not going to
[33:15] be fighting the Romans he's not going to
[33:17] be going all that but he said it's going
[33:19] to be a kingdom it's going to be inside
[33:20] of you and you're going to see these
[33:22] things but you're going to have but it's
[33:23] going to be a spiritual Kingdom that
[33:25] you're going to come to right amen as as
[33:28] he began to talk to him he said listen
[33:29] he said let not your heart you know
[33:31] don't be comfortless let your hearts be
[33:33] comforted by this that listen he said
[33:35] I'm not going to be with you always he
[33:37] said it's expedient that I go away but
[33:39] I'm coming back in a way that I'm not
[33:43] going to be just with you but I'm going
[33:44] to take up residence inside of you amen
[33:47] I'm coming he said he said because I
[33:49] will be with you even in You Until the
[33:52] End of the Age until the end of the
[33:54] world so when he began to talk to him
[33:56] about this he began to teach them about
[33:58] this Kingdom that was coming not not
[34:00] this not this Earthly Kingdom and the
[34:02] things that were going on but there was
[34:04] a spiritual Kingdom because that was
[34:06] what was important because it's not
[34:08] what's done here but there's going to be
[34:09] an afterlife after this about this life
[34:12] that's going to take place after all
[34:14] this is
[34:15] gone
[34:17] amen so it was more important and that's
[34:20] what Jesus was trying to tell them there
[34:21] is a kingdom that's coming
[34:28] because
[34:29] when when you see this you know they're
[34:32] W they're wanting to you know the
[34:34] disciples and you know they're trying to
[34:36] talk about this Kingdom that's coming
[34:38] that's going to be set up on the earth
[34:39] and not realizing there was a whole
[34:41] different way that this was going to
[34:42] come into view there was a different way
[34:45] that it was coming yes there is going to
[34:46] be a kingdom set up on the Earth but
[34:48] it's not going to come the same way that
[34:49] y'all think it's going to come that's
[34:51] right amen there's a whole lot of things
[34:53] that y'all don't see but Jesus began to
[34:55] preach to them and tell them about those
[34:58] things and he began to teach them and
[34:59] listen this is what's going to take
[35:02] place so you know you know we don't have
[35:04] to fight the Romans and all these type
[35:07] things it's it's not an Earthly battle
[35:09] it's a spiritual battle yes but you know
[35:13] even after you know when when Jesus died
[35:15] when when he went to the cross and he
[35:17] and he rose again and he's standing
[35:19] there and he begins to speak to him and
[35:21] he's talking about going away to fulfill
[35:23] the scriptures after he's begin talk to
[35:26] him on the road to a and all the
[35:28] different things talking to Thomas when
[35:30] he didn't believe and all those things
[35:32] that he began to do and began to speak
[35:34] to him about all those things that had
[35:35] taken place when they had seen all these
[35:37] things when they had seen him raised
[35:39] from the dead and they' seen the
[35:40] Miracles that he had done being able to
[35:41] walk through the walls and all those
[35:43] type things and he began to tell them
[35:45] about this Kingdom that was coming he's
[35:47] like are you going to take over
[35:49] now he'd been trying to teach them that
[35:51] it's a spiritual Kingdom right and now
[35:54] is the time that when we get past this
[35:56] listen the I got to go
[35:59] away but the comforter is coming that's
[36:02] right listen I'm going to go away but
[36:05] I'm coming
[36:06] back and the comforter is going to come
[36:08] inside you and he's going to take up
[36:11] residence inside of
[36:13] you and not only that he's going to be a
[36:15] comforter but he's also going to bring
[36:17] to your remembrance the things that
[36:19] you've heard amen the things that you've
[36:21] been
[36:22] taught he's going to lead you and guide
[36:24] you into all truth
[36:27] and as as he was you know he spilled his
[36:30] blood and he Sanctified the Earth and he
[36:32] claimed it am but see you know as they
[36:37] they were missing the whole point of
[36:38] what he was trying to
[36:40] do but see it's the same thing with you
[36:43] and I heing is trying to show us these
[36:46] things and you know here they are
[36:48] they're missing out on the whole thing
[36:49] that he done right and and here's Jesus
[36:53] speaking to the disciples and he told
[36:55] them he said listen he said if you see
[36:56] me go away he said but Terry in
[36:58] Jerusalem till you be endued with power
[36:59] from on high
[37:01] right and so there was a lot more
[37:03] questions than they had
[37:05] answers when they were in the upper room
[37:08] and Jesus began to speak to him in the
[37:10] upper room and he began to express the
[37:11] things that were going to take place and
[37:13] he began to talk to them and he began to
[37:15] break the bread with them and he had
[37:16] communion he began to wash their feet
[37:18] and all these things and he began to
[37:19] teach these things to them and show him
[37:22] what's going to take place but you know
[37:23] he started to show him the heart of a
[37:25] servant and the love that he had for him
[37:27] but but he was trying to show them
[37:28] listen don't be don't lose heart don't
[37:30] be don't be comfortless in this because
[37:33] you know what you're going to see a
[37:34] greater thing that's going to take place
[37:35] but they missed it right
[37:38] amen you know they were they got so
[37:41] downtrodden and lost and you know so sad
[37:43] because what was taking place not
[37:45] realizing there was the exact
[37:47] fulfillment of God's word they're
[37:49] standing in the midst of the Fulfillment
[37:51] of God's word and they're missing
[37:53] it and he goes and he goes to to a send
[37:56] and he tells them listen
[37:59] T and go and wait till the Holy Spirit
[38:02] comes and fulfills what he said he would
[38:04] do am and he comes and and so they go
[38:07] and Terry and you know and you know well
[38:09] we don't know what we're
[38:11] doing we got more questions and we got
[38:15] answers but all we know is what Jesus
[38:18] said and it's like well we don't know
[38:21] we're trying to we're trying to hide
[38:22] from the Romans and you know we don't
[38:23] know what the world's going to take
[38:25] place and you know we're more scared
[38:26] than you know we don't know what to
[38:29] do that's right but you know what they
[38:32] stood right where they God told them to
[38:33] stand where Jesus told them to
[38:36] stand you know and there were well you
[38:38] know we wait one day wait two days
[38:41] week what what do we see
[38:46] nothing but you know what they continue
[38:48] to wait I don't know how long we're
[38:50] going to have to wait but we're going to
[38:52] wait we're going to be right here
[38:54] waiting and teing and waiting until the
[38:57] Fulfillment of the word come amen and
[39:00] you know and well I think we've waited
[39:02] long enough we might have waited long
[39:03] enough I don't
[39:05] know but like Peter said you know we're
[39:07] going to have to wait because if if it's
[39:10] something definite that Jesus said was
[39:12] going to take place then guess what when
[39:14] it fulfills when when you see the
[39:16] Fulfillment of it there's not going to
[39:17] be a question about it right now it may
[39:19] be a question to everybody else but if
[39:21] it comes to you it's not going to be a
[39:23] question to you it's going to be an
[39:25] answer it's going to be a fulfillment
[39:26] it's going to be a confirmation to you
[39:28] that what took place and so when they
[39:31] waited those 10 days when they waited
[39:33] and the sound of a rushing Mighty Wind
[39:35] came down and it flooded the place and
[39:37] it landed upon you know it set upon all
[39:39] of them and they received the Holy
[39:42] Spirit then you know what they didn't
[39:44] have they didn't have a question of what
[39:45] was taking place because that was a
[39:47] fulfilment and it was an answer to them
[39:50] it was a comfort to them and it was so
[39:52] it was a sign to them of what took place
[39:55] and you know what when they had that all
[39:56] of a sudden here they are had great
[39:58] boldness with the word they because they
[40:01] began to De because the Holy Spirit
[40:02] began to lead them it was a fulfillment
[40:05] being again to Quicken the things that
[40:07] he had said to them and so here they are
[40:10] when they're standing there all of a
[40:12] sudden here they are acting like drunk
[40:15] men 120 of them standing up there here
[40:18] they are acting acting drunk and people
[40:20] wonder what what's going
[40:21] on and here's Peter standing there
[40:24] speaking of what was taking place and he
[40:25] said you know he stood up with the 11
[40:28] you know he stood there and said these
[40:31] men are not drunk as you
[40:33] suppose and he said this is that that
[40:36] was spoken of by the prophet Joel it was
[40:39] a fulfillment of the word amen now there
[40:42] was a lot of people they didn't
[40:43] understand
[40:44] that they didn't believe
[40:49] that but when they start when they
[40:51] staggered out when Peter and them came
[40:53] out and they began to preach the word
[40:55] that they had heard and began to tell
[40:56] them what was taking place this is the
[40:58] Fulfillment of the
[41:00] word but you know there was no doubt
[41:02] many people that were there that heard
[41:04] heard the
[41:05] message I'm sure no doubt there was a a
[41:08] large crowd of people but you know what
[41:10] there was only a certain group of people
[41:13] that actually received the word for
[41:14] their day right we don't know how we
[41:17] know there was the the 5,000 that
[41:19] received it but we don't know how many
[41:20] of that was that were
[41:22] there how many that actually heard the
[41:24] word that was preached that day and they
[41:26] began to because here these people are
[41:28] standing there and they're hearing the
[41:30] word being preached in their own
[41:32] language here it is every they're
[41:35] understanding it because not every not
[41:37] all of them could speak the same
[41:38] language but all the the message that
[41:40] went forth they were hearing it in their
[41:41] own tongue they began to understand what
[41:45] was being preached that day and they
[41:47] begin to receive what was preached and
[41:49] began to understand and they begin to
[41:51] accept it and they because as as Peter
[41:55] began to preach you know it said you
[41:56] know they were pricked in their hearts
[41:57] and they said men and Brethren what
[41:59] shall we
[42:02] do well just believe
[42:04] it
[42:06] amen just just make sure you just get in
[42:09] the line and tell everybody I believe
[42:11] what the apostles
[42:13] preached I'm I'm I'm part of that Upper
[42:15] Room
[42:17] movement I'm going to get me a belt
[42:19] buckle that says the upper room
[42:23] movement no because when they were
[42:25] pricked in their hearts by what the word
[42:27] said he said what did they what was they
[42:29] said men and Brethren what shall we
[42:31] do would just follow us just so well I
[42:35] believe
[42:37] it no he said he said
[42:41] repent right well what does it mean to
[42:44] repent it means to turn from your ways
[42:46] and realize that this is a move of God
[42:48] and I've not been walking in the ways of
[42:50] God and now I can repent of my sin and
[42:52] realize I'm a sinner and he said repent
[42:56] and follow the way that God has called
[42:58] you and he said repent and be baptized
[43:01] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[43:02] remission of your sins and he said and
[43:05] ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
[43:07] Ghost but see the problem is is that
[43:09] because they had to realize what the
[43:11] word had come to them and it quickened
[43:13] something to them that they had to
[43:14] fulfill that and because they had faith
[43:17] in what the apostles had said they went
[43:20] out there and they began to repent and
[43:22] they were baptized that's right and they
[43:25] baptized 3,000 souls in one one
[43:30] day like somebody was trying to do the
[43:32] math and it's like well if you got 12
[43:33] people and you're baptizing 3,000 people
[43:36] that's like several hundred people one
[43:38] person's baptizing and I don't know how
[43:40] many more there was but you know there's
[43:42] 120 in the upper
[43:44] room you know half of them
[43:47] men you know there's 60 men 3,000 that's
[43:50] what
[43:52] 50 so I mean you know here they are
[43:54] preaching the gospel this holy the Holy
[43:56] Spirit and you have this Supernatural
[43:59] meeting taking place and then the rest
[44:00] of the afternoon you're out there
[44:02] baptizing people
[44:05] amen but see it was something that took
[44:08] place but that was the word of God that
[44:09] had broke to them and it began to move
[44:11] and they began to see these things and
[44:13] see they began to walk in those things
[44:15] yes and it became
[44:17] real and all of a sudden the things that
[44:20] that Peter had had wondered about the
[44:22] things that the the apostles had heard
[44:24] that Jesus said all of a sudden the Holy
[44:26] Spirit was there to Quicken these things
[44:28] to them and all of a sudden they begin
[44:30] to be be able to preach the things that
[44:32] they had heard the things that they had
[44:33] seen amen and all of a sudden here they
[44:35] are preaching the
[44:37] gospel and see it's the same way with
[44:39] you and I see when when you come to that
[44:41] place when you realize that the word is
[44:43] come to you and it's yours and you've
[44:45] received this
[44:46] message and it's yours and you realize
[44:49] hey you know what I've got to make a
[44:50] change because you know because you come
[44:52] to a place I I I I had to come to a
[44:55] place in my life you know I I know lord
[44:57] I can't live like this anymore right I
[44:59] had to make a change I I didn't want to
[45:01] live like this
[45:03] anymore because you know I couldn't
[45:05] change myself I couldn't change the
[45:07] situation that I was in but you know
[45:09] what God made a way because all I had to
[45:11] do is accept him and and and yield
[45:14] myself to him and surrender to him that
[45:16] he can do the work amen amen because
[45:19] that's the main thing can you surrender
[45:21] and realize I'm just going to put my
[45:22] hands by myself and everything in your
[45:25] hands Lord and you do the work right
[45:28] let let you do
[45:30] this but I'm going to put my trust in
[45:33] you and realize just just like just like
[45:38] the disciples just like Peter all you
[45:39] know they all done they done things
[45:41] wrong they failed they were men right
[45:45] and you and you to do the same thing
[45:47] we're just humans we're going to fall
[45:48] we're going to have problems we're going
[45:50] to have
[45:51] setbacks but see the thing is is is
[45:54] you've got you've got to come to the
[45:55] place and realize this is what God has
[45:57] called you to and you're going to face
[45:58] this thing and you're going to you have
[46:00] a desire to do this and you have a
[46:02] desire to do it you're going to you're
[46:04] going to do what with what you can and
[46:06] you you got to press into this thing
[46:09] amen you know I mean you know you see
[46:11] things because if you have a desire for
[46:14] something you know what it it you going
[46:16] to you got to fight you've got to press
[46:18] into this thing right amen you
[46:21] know you
[46:23] know I'm I'm going tell on myself a
[46:25] little bit but Richard said I don't
[46:27] never tell I don't never tell nothing
[46:29] about myself I always tell everything on
[46:30] him but um but I think Richard's stories
[46:34] are a lot better than
[46:36] mine or maybe I just tell them
[46:40] better but you know I had people at work
[46:42] when just
[46:44] recently you know I had people come to
[46:46] me at work and you know they asked me
[46:49] are you okay are you all
[46:51] right you know because they they they
[46:53] they were like well what's wrong with
[46:55] you you're not you're not the same
[46:57] person that you used to be said you used
[46:59] to be you were you were the you know
[47:02] everything no matter what went wrong
[47:04] every Problem whatever said you was the
[47:05] ray of sunshine around here he was
[47:07] always positive everything was great
[47:09] it's like why but it's like are you are
[47:11] you we we're just checking on your
[47:13] mental health are you
[47:16] okay and I and you know and and the
[47:18] problem is this and I finally you know
[47:21] because I I had I just you know because
[47:24] you get aggravated with things right and
[47:27] the problem is is when you when you know
[47:29] when you work a job and you and you know
[47:32] I said well I've been here over 11 years
[47:34] I said there was always a standard that
[47:36] we had there was always an expectation
[47:38] of things that had to be done and the
[47:40] way things had to be done there's there
[47:41] was an expectation and there was an
[47:44] accountability that was going to that we
[47:45] had to go through and all these things
[47:47] and I said the problem is is everybody's
[47:49] got away from
[47:51] that I said because now there there's no
[47:54] standard there's no expect ation there's
[47:57] no accountability to anything and I said
[48:00] all of a sudden then you start to see
[48:02] well if you don't have an expectation if
[48:04] you don't have an accountability for
[48:06] things that you know what things don't
[48:08] get done the first thing you don't
[48:10] because nothing can run right because
[48:12] you've got to have a leader and you got
[48:14] to have an expectation and you've got to
[48:16] have a standard that you're going to
[48:18] work from and everybody's got to meet
[48:20] that standard and if you don't if you
[48:22] don't have people meeting the standard
[48:24] then you know what nothing gets done
[48:26] because you know what not everybody can
[48:27] just float along because you know what
[48:29] everybody's got a part to play and
[48:31] everybody's got to do their part and
[48:33] then you you may not be the you may not
[48:35] be what this person is or what that
[48:36] person is but you've got to do what
[48:38] you're called to do it's your job to do
[48:40] your part because I can't do my part and
[48:42] your part and expect everything to run
[48:44] right
[48:45] right and there's people that you hire
[48:48] new people in but you know what you've
[48:49] got to come on you've got to come on on
[48:51] the job and be ready to learn and have
[48:54] have the understanding listen I don't
[48:56] know everything and I'm not a know it
[48:58] all but the problem is is you've got to
[48:59] be to the place that you're willing to
[49:01] learn and you've got to be willing to be
[49:04] taught what needs to be done and you got
[49:06] to realize that when the when the when
[49:08] the job is given to you when the when
[49:09] the order is given to you then you know
[49:11] what you got to do it to the best of
[49:12] your ability and you can't just halfway
[49:15] do something and expect it to be okay
[49:17] that's right and I and I was one and I
[49:20] got frustrated with a lot of people
[49:22] because the problem is is we're not
[49:23] holding the
[49:25] standard right I said because when I got
[49:27] here I said there was an expectation of
[49:29] what had to be done and how it had to be
[49:32] done and I said now everybody just lets
[49:34] everything go however and then we just
[49:36] clean up the mess and I said this is not
[49:38] the way this is supposed to be
[49:39] run right right and I let I I let my
[49:43] feelings getting on and I I had to go
[49:45] back and apologize to them and I I and I
[49:47] did but the problem is is like listen if
[49:49] if this is the way it's got to be done
[49:51] then you know what we've got to hold the
[49:53] standard and if the word of God is the
[49:56] standard and we operate and the way we
[49:58] live our lives and everything operates
[50:00] off of this then you know what either we
[50:02] sell out and we do this exactly the way
[50:05] God says it or we just quit and go home
[50:08] right because that's exactly what I told
[50:10] them at work I said well we either going
[50:12] to do it right or we might as well just
[50:13] go
[50:15] home that's right because you know what
[50:17] it's not going to because you can only
[50:18] run this so far and then after that all
[50:20] you runs into the
[50:22] ground and I told him I said listen I
[50:25] care about my job
[50:28] but you know what and everybody say well
[50:29] it's just a job it's just a job no no
[50:32] because the Bible tells me now may be
[50:35] wrong but the Bible tells me that
[50:37] whatever we do in word or deed we do it
[50:39] as un the Lord right so tell me where I
[50:43] can go a job and get paid for and just
[50:45] like well K SRA
[50:50] Sarah and everybody's like well you know
[50:54] then it's likew what are we going to do
[50:55] about well listen let me tell you what
[50:57] you do from the beginning you start off
[51:01] right you start doing it right from the
[51:03] beginning and if you stay that way then
[51:07] when you finish it'll be right
[51:10] right just like Brother Gary back there
[51:13] building
[51:14] something you know if you say well e
[51:17] eighth of an inch here is okay quarter
[51:19] of an inch there little bit here a
[51:21] little bit there you know what nothing's
[51:23] ever going to work out
[51:24] right because there's only so much that
[51:27] that you can
[51:28] deviate but you know you've got to hold
[51:30] it to the line and it's got to match up
[51:33] all the way through because you can't
[51:35] just cut Corners here or there because
[51:37] when you get to the end then you got a
[51:38] mess on your hand because nothing's
[51:40] going to work right right and it's the
[51:43] same way with the word of God you know
[51:45] all you got to do is start
[51:47] right is that what brother BR said you
[51:49] you start right you go right you
[51:51] continue right he said you end up right
[51:54] and that's all you got to do is continue
[51:55] in the way that God
[51:57] made so when when God made the way he
[52:01] put it in order that all we got to do is
[52:03] continue that way right but that's what
[52:06] God is expecting us God doesn't expect
[52:09] us to you know he realizes that you're
[52:12] human you're going to have faults and
[52:13] failures but the thing is is you've got
[52:15] to come back to the same place listen if
[52:17] you fall and you fail you have sin
[52:19] whatever guess what you go right back to
[52:21] the place where you came from you pick
[52:23] yourself up you you repent you get back
[52:26] up you dust yourself off and you get
[52:28] going
[52:30] again because you can't
[52:34] stop because that's what the devil wants
[52:36] you to do the devil wants you to get to
[52:38] a place and you know you get to a place
[52:41] where you're just having a pity party
[52:42] God you know God wants you to
[52:45] go why because his his the the blood has
[52:49] been shed and it's it'll cover all your
[52:51] sins it'll take care of everything and
[52:53] he's always there with open arms I've
[52:56] never seen him yet in my lifetime when I
[52:58] have fallen when I had a need that he
[52:59] wasn't there waiting on me to come to
[53:02] the place that I needed because most of
[53:04] the times I tried to do things in my own
[53:06] self and I went away from him but you
[53:08] know he was always waiting on me to come
[53:09] back to where he was at when I came back
[53:12] to the word when I came back to a place
[53:14] of repentance he was waiting on me yes
[53:19] sir see if we can do that and realize
[53:23] what God's done for
[53:25] us God has made a
[53:28] way see if you come through that and
[53:31] realize see God has brought the word to
[53:35] us he's called us to this
[53:38] day the day and hour which we live the
[53:40] word has come for our day he spoke to
[53:43] each one of us
[53:46] see what a what a great glorious day
[53:48] that we live in that God's word came
[53:51] it's it's for us that as the scriptures
[53:55] said he excuse me the word Malachi 4
[54:00] Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 these
[54:04] scriptures you know they don't mean a
[54:06] lot to the world there's a lot of people
[54:07] that don't understand those things but
[54:09] you know blessed are your eyes for they
[54:11] see blessed are our eyes because we see
[54:14] because it came to our for our day that
[54:18] we began to see these things and
[54:19] understand behold I send you Elijah the
[54:23] prophet so these things were given to us
[54:25] for us to understand and receive these
[54:28] things see the word is went for went in
[54:31] our day what' he say see the the message
[54:35] came to us in our day to understand what
[54:39] was taking place it was a fulfillment of
[54:41] the word that we realize that today is
[54:44] the day of salvation and he began to
[54:46] speak to these
[54:48] things you realize what's taken place
[54:50] and you know people have missed the day
[54:52] and hour that the of the of the Lord
[54:57] and you know as the scripture says here
[54:59] as we were reading in the beginning he
[55:01] said but the day of the Lord shall come
[55:03] as a thief in the
[55:05] night you know because you realize you
[55:07] know it's it's a secret coming and you
[55:09] realize that God is speaking to each
[55:11] person
[55:13] individually but he's calling a bride
[55:16] amen you know as as brother R was
[55:18] speaking there you know when is talking
[55:20] about you know the um the the the shout
[55:24] you know the shout was a message that
[55:26] went forth there was a message that went
[55:28] and you know it was to those people it's
[55:30] not to the world but there's a group of
[55:32] people that's predestinated to that and
[55:34] it's to them that they catch the The
[55:36] Voice amen they catch the the the
[55:39] message is to them right and blessed are
[55:42] you and I because we have received that
[55:44] message and realize this is the day and
[55:47] hour see as as they were saying in the
[55:49] beginning see things continue as they
[55:51] were they're not continuing as they
[55:54] were see God has been changing and
[55:57] moving and he's began to unveil himself
[55:59] and there's many people that that have
[56:01] heard these things but you know it
[56:02] wasn't to
[56:04] them and you you look through brother
[56:06] bram's Ministry and he began to speak
[56:08] and he you know through the Healing
[56:10] Ministry and everything and he began to
[56:12] preach a message to the
[56:14] people and he began to show them the
[56:16] word amen and he began to show them the
[56:19] errors of their ways or the
[56:21] denominations and and all the things
[56:23] that were taking place he began to point
[56:25] them back to the scripture and show him
[56:28] this is the Fulfillment of the word of
[56:31] what was taking place and yet they they
[56:33] turned him
[56:34] down because it was because here they
[56:37] they they want to hang on to their own
[56:38] denomination they want to hang on to
[56:40] their own beliefs their own thoughts and
[56:42] here here he was and you know here he
[56:44] began to preach and began to show them
[56:46] all these things and show them what was
[56:47] taking
[56:49] place but there was a group of people
[56:52] they turned down and walked away from
[56:53] these things but there was a group of
[56:55] people that began to hear the word and
[56:58] realize that was that was Eagle food to
[57:00] them it was a word to them it was what
[57:02] they were longing for and they began to
[57:05] catch on to these things and realize
[57:07] this is this is the day and hour this is
[57:08] my word because when he said I behold I
[57:11] send you Elijah the prophet it become it
[57:14] became personal to them to re this is
[57:16] this is personal to me this is what I
[57:18] believe this is the word to me that I'm
[57:21] I'm walking in this I'm I receive this
[57:24] as the word and realizing that what it's
[57:26] doing is it's changing me amen so when
[57:29] you see these things when when they say
[57:31] well you know how things are taking
[57:33] place but I realize the that was what's
[57:36] all this is supposed to take place we're
[57:38] supposed to have scoffers we're supposed
[57:40] to have those that you know because in
[57:42] our mid we're we're going to we're
[57:43] supposed to have the as brother Bob was
[57:46] talking about listen we're supposed to
[57:47] have false anointed ones we're supposed
[57:49] to have all these things take place but
[57:52] as Bob as brother Bob was preaching you
[57:54] know we realize all these things are
[57:55] supposed to take
[57:57] place but he said like he said but Jesus
[58:00] told us the the elect cannot be deceived
[58:03] amen but it's supposed to be so close
[58:06] that it's that it could deceive the very
[58:08] elect to see the condition and the hour
[58:10] in which we live but you know what the
[58:11] word is com in our day to show us where
[58:14] we're standing and for us to be
[58:15] fortified behind the word to realize in
[58:17] the day and hour which we live that you
[58:19] know what we don't we cannot be deceived
[58:22] the Lord because it brings us to a place
[58:25] to real realize who we're where who we
[58:27] are where we're
[58:29] standing and we catch these things and
[58:31] realize because if God was the one that
[58:33] brought us to this place brother Bob if
[58:35] he started us on this journey and he's
[58:37] brought us to this place do you know
[58:38] he's going to carry us all the
[58:40] way that he's going to take us all the
[58:42] way through yes
[58:45] sir because I didn't start I didn't
[58:47] start on this journey on my own I can't
[58:49] keep myself in this in this way it's
[58:52] because all of Because of Him amen you
[58:56] know I put my trust in him because he
[58:58] showed me what to
[59:00] doly and if we realize it's just that
[59:03] childlike Faith to realize that we just
[59:05] hold on right amen amen but you know
[59:08] what what will God do for us as you
[59:11] begin to receive the word you become the
[59:13] word as brother Bob was talking about
[59:16] you you begin to realize who you are you
[59:18] begin to see who you are and you begin
[59:20] to see your position in Christ and you
[59:23] begin to grow in Christ and you begin to
[59:25] things begin to open up more to you and
[59:26] you begin to see these
[59:28] things and what a wonderful time when
[59:30] you begin to see the things that are
[59:32] taking place and you understand where
[59:33] you're living
[59:36] amen you know and it's and it's such a
[59:38] wonderful thing because you you know you
[59:40] realize that when the more God reveals
[59:43] to you and the more he shows you who you
[59:45] are right you
[59:48] realize how how low you
[59:51] are how little you
[59:54] are it makes him everything thing amen
[59:57] amen because there's nothing good in
[1:00:00] you but what a wonderful job he's that
[1:00:03] work that he's done in us to bring us to
[1:00:05] this
[1:00:07] place I'm so glad that he's brought me
[1:00:10] to this
[1:00:12] place that I that I could put my trust
[1:00:14] in him and realize hey it won't be much
[1:00:18] longer right well have the musicians
[1:00:20] come but we realize let's all stand but
[1:00:22] we realize it won't be much longer God
[1:00:25] has bringing us to the place that we're
[1:00:27] going to see the the Fulfillment of
[1:00:29] these
[1:00:31] things I'm looking forward to
[1:00:37] it to see all these wonderful things
[1:00:40] that God has promised to
[1:00:45] us see when you see the the condition
[1:00:49] that the world has gotten
[1:00:54] into we know what's going to take
[1:00:59] place I was I
[1:01:01] was talking to somebody the other day we
[1:01:03] talking about the you know the condition
[1:01:06] that the world is getting into and all
[1:01:08] the you know all these things and you
[1:01:10] know but you
[1:01:12] know God made us a
[1:01:15] promise and you know brother Ram said
[1:01:17] you know we've seen all of these things
[1:01:20] all these you know he had seven visions
[1:01:21] and he was talking about the seven
[1:01:23] visions of the things that's taking
[1:01:24] place and you know
[1:01:27] he said he said that last Vision that he
[1:01:28] saw he saw America burn over he a
[1:01:31] smoldering Ash Heap it's done it's it's
[1:01:34] finished there was nothing
[1:01:36] left you know and here everybody you
[1:01:38] know you know what what what what about
[1:01:40] what about my my 401k and what what
[1:01:43] about what about my house and what about
[1:01:45] this and what about that and it's like
[1:01:47] listen you're fighting over Canon
[1:01:51] F it's going to be
[1:01:54] gone now you know that that doesn't mean
[1:01:56] that you know we just well we're not
[1:01:58] going we're not going to have a house
[1:01:59] we're not going we're just going to live
[1:02:00] like noads or whatever no you've got to
[1:02:02] live but the thing is is you got to have
[1:02:07] priorities you know what God fed me
[1:02:09] every day of my life he's clothed me
[1:02:12] every day of my life I've had a roof
[1:02:14] over my
[1:02:16] head it's kind of kind of odd in there
[1:02:19] sometimes but we did have a roof over
[1:02:21] our head the whole time but you know
[1:02:23] God's always taking care of us
[1:02:26] yeah but you know what one of these days
[1:02:28] all this is going to be
[1:02:30] gone we're not have we don't have to
[1:02:32] worry about all of
[1:02:35] this because it's it's not we're not
[1:02:38] you're not going to take it in the
[1:02:39] Rapture with
[1:02:41] you thank thank God you know it's like
[1:02:44] listen you know we worry about
[1:02:45] electronics and and all these different
[1:02:48] things but you know I always tell them
[1:02:50] thank God that there won't there won't
[1:02:51] be cell phones and there won't be
[1:02:54] radios at on the other side when we get
[1:02:57] out of here there will be a day that you
[1:02:58] know what we won't need cell phones
[1:02:59] anymore we won't need radios we won't
[1:03:02] need all this stuff all of it it it had
[1:03:05] it had its purpose and thank God for it
[1:03:07] but you know what there's a time all
[1:03:08] this is going to be done away
[1:03:10] with but what what's the most
[1:03:13] important is the kingdom of God and his
[1:03:17] word seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:03:20] and his righteousness and all these
[1:03:23] things shall be added unto you you know
[1:03:26] because there in and Peter you know he
[1:03:28] is speaking at the end you know he's
[1:03:30] talking about the the Earth being
[1:03:31] destroyed and he said that there comes a
[1:03:33] day when you know the the elements are
[1:03:35] going to melt with fervent heat and all
[1:03:37] this is going to be done away with and
[1:03:39] we realize you know brother R talking
[1:03:40] about the Earth will not be destroyed
[1:03:43] but all the effects and all the things
[1:03:44] on it and all these things where man has
[1:03:47] touched will be destroyed and it'll go
[1:03:50] back to where the way it was and see we
[1:03:52] we see how all these things are going to
[1:03:54] take place but realizing you know all
[1:03:56] this is going to be done with but you
[1:03:57] know it's all going to be made
[1:03:59] new and we don't have to worry about
[1:04:01] it's it going to be a wonderful time to
[1:04:02] realize we're going to be right back
[1:04:03] where we were on this Earth and all the
[1:04:06] sin and all the filth and all these
[1:04:08] things are going to be do away
[1:04:11] with as as he was told Brother R was
[1:04:14] talking about you know he he was making
