[9:00] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for
[9:02] the opportunity that we have to open
[9:04] back the pages of your word and Lord
[9:06] Jesus father we we we know Lord God
[9:09] Almighty that you are in your word
[9:11] father because you are the word Lord you
[9:13] are the author heavenly father and and
[9:16] because you're the author Lord Jesus you
[9:18] can give the revelation of what you
[9:20] wrote here father God Lord let the life
[9:22] father God of these words pop out from
[9:24] these Pages this evening Lord God and
[9:27] Lord um give us a revelation of your
[9:30] word father because without Revelation
[9:32] Lord God Almighty we we cannot do
[9:35] anything father God from the Heart Lord
[9:37] Jesus but with Revelation Lord God
[9:40] Almighty then lord it's something
[9:41] genuine something real and I pray Lord
[9:44] that you just help us to be genuine real
[9:47] Christians because we we want to be Lord
[9:49] God and I just ask heavenly father that
[9:52] you just have your way Lord here this
[9:54] this evening forgive us for all of our
[9:56] sins Lord God where we fail you Lord
[9:59] where we maybe got in the flesh Lord God
[10:01] or thought something maybe that we
[10:03] shouldn't have Lord or even said
[10:05] something that wasn't pleasing to you we
[10:07] ask for forgiveness Lord we ask that you
[10:09] would cleanse us father and place those
[10:11] things under the blood of Jesus Christ
[10:13] so that Heavenly Father you'd have your
[10:15] way here amongst us Lord we can't save
[10:17] ourselves we can't forgive our own sins
[10:19] but Lord you did it all for us so we we
[10:22] have no need to do that Lord but father
[10:24] we plead you Lord we plead the blood of
[10:26] Jesus Christ this evening granted Lord
[10:28] Jesus continue to meet the needs amongst
[10:30] us and we love you and we commit this
[10:32] time into your hands and my lips in your
[10:34] hands Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen
[10:37] amen God bless you amen I thought that
[10:40] that that we would continue from last
[10:42] time uh the matters of the heart um so
[10:47] we're going to um we're going to
[10:49] continue that and this is part two and
[10:52] and Saints the reason why why why why I
[10:54] look at this just right before the the
[10:56] we read the word is because I believe
[10:59] that um I believe that everything that
[11:02] we do amen stems from from the heart
[11:05] everything that you think everything
[11:07] that moves you everything that ticks in
[11:10] your life is is is is is from is from
[11:13] the heart there's a there's a root of of
[11:16] everything that we do and everything
[11:18] that who we are and it comes from the
[11:21] heart and and and it's and that's a
[11:23] genuine way to live life but there is a
[11:27] fake way to live life and the Pharisees
[11:30] give us a good example about that and so
[11:33] we just want to maybe touch upon that
[11:35] this evening so let's just read the word
[11:37] in in Proverbs chapter 4 the Bible says
[11:40] here my son attend verse 20 my son
[11:43] attend to my words incline thine ear
[11:46] unto my says this is pro this is this is
[11:50] uh Solomon the wisest man that have that
[11:53] has ever lived saying these things these
[11:56] things to his son incline thine ear unto
[11:59] my sayings let them not depart from
[12:02] Thine Eyes keep them in the midst of
[12:05] thine heart for they are life unto those
[12:08] that find them and health to all their
[12:10] flesh keep thy heart verse 23 keep thy
[12:14] heart with all diligence for out of it
[12:18] are the issues of life amen you may be
[12:21] seated this
[12:22] evening
[12:25] amen I like the way the the way uh
[12:28] Solomon says it here he says incline
[12:31] thine ear unto my sayings and in other
[12:35] words he's telling his son he says in
[12:37] other words take importance or or or be
[12:41] hopefully what I'm saying to you is
[12:43] interesting because when something is
[12:46] interesting you you want to get a little
[12:48] bit closer to here right you incline
[12:51] your your your you get a little bit uh
[12:54] uh I what was that brother Boyd I
[12:56] couldn't hear you you see because you
[12:58] you you're interested in what they had
[13:00] to say right or you want them to repeat
[13:02] again what they wanted to say and so
[13:04] that's what that's what Solomon is
[13:06] trying to tell his son here incline
[13:07] thine ear in other words show interest
[13:09] in what I want to tell you amen and
[13:12] that's what we want to do this evening
[13:13] amen is I hope that instead of us doing
[13:16] this we do this amen incline our ears
[13:21] Amen to to hear what the word has to say
[13:24] not what I have to say but but what the
[13:26] word says amen because the word has life
[13:29] in it how many believe that Jesus said
[13:32] that my words are spirit and they are
[13:34] life so if they have life or if they are
[13:38] life that means they life changing right
[13:42] they should change your life if you
[13:44] really take them to
[13:45] heart but if we if we're not paying
[13:48] attention then they won't change us so
[13:51] we want to pay attention amen so he says
[13:53] here my son attend to my words incline
[13:56] thine ear unto my sayings and he he he
[14:00] could say that because God gave him
[14:02] wisdom amen was the wisest man that has
[14:04] ever lived upon this face of the of of
[14:07] the earth we know that how he ended up
[14:10] how he ended up and I I never could
[14:12] understand the wisest man but ended up
[14:14] the way he did it just goes to show amen
[14:18] we all need the Holy Ghost if it ain't
[14:20] without the Holy Ghost if it ain't with
[14:22] without God in our soul which Solomon
[14:24] didn't have amen he had an anointing
[14:27] upon him he had a form of salvation but
[14:30] he didn't he could not enjoy the
[14:32] benefits of the new birth like you and I
[14:35] can right I don't believe that a man
[14:38] with the genuine New Birth would end up
[14:41] being the way s uh Solomon ended up uh
[14:45] in his life you know with with letting
[14:47] women dragging him to serving other gods
[14:50] and things like that and that's how he
[14:51] ended up being but at this point you
[14:53] know but yet God deemed it that his
[14:57] words were so precious and so so w wise
[15:00] to give us a book ecclesiastics is
[15:03] another one amen and of course here in
[15:05] the Book of Proverbs so there very wise
[15:08] sayings and he says here let them not
[15:10] depart from Thine Eyes keep them in the
[15:12] midst of thine heart and we're just
[15:15] we're just doing just a little review
[15:16] from last time amen and and and then
[15:19] we'll continue where we left off last
[15:20] time for they are for they are
[15:24] life amen the these words are life unto
[15:28] those
[15:29] that find them right and in order for
[15:31] you to find something you have had to
[15:33] been looking for it
[15:35] correct you know it that's how you if
[15:38] you're really Desiring something if
[15:40] you're really looking for something
[15:42] you're going to find it it's what Jesus
[15:44] said in his word amen seek and you shall
[15:46] find knock and it shall be opened unto
[15:49] you praise God so I I God wants us to
[15:53] knock God wants us to seek God wants us
[15:57] to to to to receive and not just read
[16:00] the word and open the word listen to the
[16:02] message and not get anything out of it
[16:04] and I'm afraid a lot of us do that amen
[16:07] we don't get anything out of it because
[16:09] we don't look at things with
[16:12] Revelation Lord I'm opening your word
[16:15] reveal to me your heart amen reveal to
[16:19] me your heart amen because your heart is
[16:21] is in this word amen his heart is in his
[16:24] word amen for they are life unto those
[16:26] that find them and health to all their
[16:29] flesh and verse 23 is the key verse here
[16:31] keep thy heart with all diligence for
[16:35] out of
[16:37] it are the issues of
[16:40] life out of your heart amen and we
[16:44] talked about last time that that uh that
[16:46] out of your heart is really you can be
[16:49] doing something or you can be saying
[16:51] something but in reality what are you in
[16:55] your
[16:55] heart you can be putting on but let's
[16:59] see what you do when you're alone
[17:01] amen that's the real you then right
[17:05] that's the real you and so that's what
[17:07] we want to have amen is we the way we
[17:10] are in public is the way we are alone
[17:13] amen the way we are when we're in school
[17:16] is the way we want to be when we're at
[17:18] church the way we are at work is the way
[17:20] we want to be when we're at church amen
[17:22] we don't want to be amen put on praise
[17:25] God God help us amen because it's easy
[17:29] to be to to to to be that way it's easy
[17:32] to lean that way amen live one life at
[17:36] church and then live live another life
[17:38] at school believe me I did that on live
[17:42] one life at work live one life at at
[17:45] church amen praise God in the good news
[17:48] translation it says be careful how you
[17:50] think your life is shaped by your
[17:53] thoughts right and and that's that's
[17:56] very true amen your life life the way
[18:00] you are where you are now is because you
[18:02] you you thought to be this way
[18:06] amen uh you you you you you the choices
[18:10] that you made throughout your lifetime
[18:11] brought you to where you are now amen
[18:15] and and it's what it's what now we know
[18:18] that it's the guidance of the Lord amen
[18:21] and you're in church tonight amen and
[18:23] you're at a good place amen amen praise
[18:26] the Lord I don't see anybody here half
[18:28] robing and flies flying out of their
[18:31] mouth you know and drunk and praise God
[18:34] thank God but you know you one of some
[18:36] of us could have been that way we could
[18:38] have been in an insane institution
[18:40] tonight right now some some some mental
[18:43] health hospital right now amen but it
[18:45] wasn't deemed by God Amen it wasn't his
[18:48] will for you to go that way amen it
[18:51] wasn't for you to for in God's will for
[18:54] you to go by the grave when you were 19
[18:56] 20 25 years old 30 years old
[18:59] amen I I you know I I was I may have
[19:02] given this testimony before but when I
[19:05] was out in the world and and drinking
[19:07] and there was one night where I was out
[19:08] partying with with my friends after I
[19:10] got off work from Papa John's Pizza
[19:13] closing up I went out and they invited
[19:16] me to go drink and stuff and and I did
[19:19] and and and and so here I am and and so
[19:23] it was like 2: 3 in the morning my
[19:26] friends are drunk well I'm I'm I'm I'm
[19:29] I'm drunk their girlfriends are drunk
[19:31] and here they are and they're like do
[19:32] you need to ride
[19:34] home and no I there was no way for me to
[19:36] get home so I just got in their car and
[19:39] I don't even know how we got home but
[19:41] they I got
[19:43] home and I just see that as the the
[19:46] grace of
[19:47] God anything could have happened but by
[19:50] the but if it wasn't for his grac amen
[19:53] amen and so this you know we're here
[19:57] because by his grace we thank God for
[20:00] that amen so we we talked about in also
[20:04] in Matthew chapter 12 it says uh uh
[20:06] Jesus saying oh Generation of Vipers how
[20:09] can ye being evil speak good things in
[20:14] other words Jesus is saying how can how
[20:17] can things good things come out of your
[20:19] heart when there is evil in your
[20:22] heart because if that is the if that's
[20:25] the ca if that's the the if that's
[20:27] what's happening amen then you're
[20:29] putting on or you're being a hypocrite
[20:32] right praise God so that's what he's
[20:35] saying here oh Generation of Vipers how
[20:37] can you being evil speak good things for
[20:40] out of the abundance of the heart the
[20:43] mouth speaketh amen so in other words
[20:45] what you feed upon what you look at what
[20:49] what is uh um you're feeding your mind
[20:52] with amen is what eventually will come
[20:54] out of your life right right praise the
[20:58] Lord
[20:59] is what eventually will come out of your
[21:01] life and so he continues to say here
[21:03] Jesus saying a good man out of the good
[21:06] Treasure of the heart so there is a good
[21:09] treasure but then there is a evil
[21:12] treasure as he as he mentioned here out
[21:14] of the the good Treasure of the heart
[21:16] bringeth forth good
[21:18] things in other words you feed on good
[21:20] things you're going to produce good
[21:21] things right amen you you you watch good
[21:25] things you're going to produce good
[21:28] things right it's going to stimulate
[21:29] your influence you and I've been looking
[21:31] at a little bit at influence and and the
[21:34] importance of influence and how we
[21:36] influence one another and and the things
[21:38] that influence us and how we influence
[21:40] other people you see and so if we allow
[21:44] things from the outside amen this
[21:47] outside world that that that are
[21:49] controlled by Satan a lot of it is amen
[21:53] they're going to influ if you let that
[21:54] just influence you and take you over and
[21:57] you become one with those things then
[22:01] you're don't be surprised that you're
[22:03] going to start acting like those things
[22:05] right
[22:07] amen there's a spirit behind everything
[22:10] sir amen right you know I see a I see a
[22:14] person riding a motorcycle out here you
[22:16] know last Sunday when they were out here
[22:18] riding motorcycles and when I go out
[22:21] here and looking at people riding the
[22:22] motorcycle I'm not expecting to see a
[22:24] man in a suit riding a motorcycle
[22:29] there there there's a certain atmosphere
[22:32] that comes with riding with you know
[22:35] Riders you know not I'm not saying not
[22:37] everyone I'm just saying you look at
[22:39] people out that they're usually wearing
[22:41] black vests and black leather and and
[22:45] have long beards and their beards waving
[22:47] over here you know as they're riding and
[22:49] and uh um you know they have maybe some
[22:52] woman behind him and the woman's wearing
[22:54] a tank top and that's the spirit that
[22:57] comes with that I wasn't going to look
[22:59] out I'm not expecting to go out there
[23:01] there and look and see a man with a suit
[23:03] and a tie and a briefcase right right
[23:06] next to him no because that's the spirit
[23:09] that goes along with that amen right you
[23:12] hear somebody you hear somebody some
[23:14] hip-hop music out here out in the
[23:16] parking lot you there's a spirit that
[23:18] goes with that right there's a spirit
[23:20] that goes with everything you see and
[23:23] and it makes you identify things for the
[23:26] spirit that is around there you see and
[23:29] so that's why that's why it's so
[23:31] important that Jesus said good man out
[23:33] of the good Treasure of the heart
[23:36] bringeth forth good things right there's
[23:38] this vessel of of of of uh of good
[23:42] treasure that you should have right and
[23:45] what's filling it with good treasure or
[23:48] good things it's because you're feeding
[23:50] on good things you're putting good
[23:51] things in there right and an evil man
[23:55] out of the evil treasure bringeth forth
[23:58] evil things so here's an evil man here's
[24:00] another person with a with a vessel or
[24:03] 50-gallon drum full of evil things but
[24:06] how did those evil things get in there
[24:08] come now brother right how did those
[24:11] evil things get in there because they
[24:13] put evil things in there amen and so
[24:16] what's going to come out of your your
[24:18] your your 50 gallon drum or your out of
[24:21] you you're the 50 gallon drum what's
[24:24] going to come out of you young people
[24:26] what's going to come out of you evil
[24:28] things
[24:30] amen 1+ 1 equals 2
[24:34] right so that's what Jesus is talking
[24:36] about so it's very it's very strange
[24:41] that you're seeing someone that you're
[24:44] expecting for certain things to come out
[24:47] of that person because by the way they
[24:49] they dress or by the way they talk by
[24:51] the way but then they're talking a
[24:53] different way yeah they're talking very
[24:56] they they're talking very Maybe
[24:58] Christlike very but yet they dress
[25:01] certain way they look a certain way they
[25:04] might even smell a certain way right and
[25:08] it doesn't it doesn't jive right and so
[25:10] that's what Jesus is trying to say amen
[25:12] amen praise God so we see here and and
[25:16] these are these are my row notes like
[25:17] last times amen
[25:20] so I got a little arrows here now so we
[25:24] were looking at Proverbs 4:23 of what
[25:26] the heart of of of this verse was and it
[25:29] was what was this verse amen and it was
[25:32] it was talking about the heart the how
[25:34] it was to keep with to keep it with all
[25:37] diligence right amen and then the why is
[25:40] of this verse is because out of it comes
[25:43] all the issues of life amen amen you are
[25:47] who you are because of your heart amen
[25:49] it's in your heart that that's who you
[25:50] are amen you are you you are the real
[25:54] you in your soul amen and so
[25:58] that's that that's the reason why we
[26:00] need to guard it with everything that we
[26:03] got amen right that's why we read our
[26:05] Bible pray every day that's why we feed
[26:07] on the word amen because that is helping
[26:10] us guard it with diligence
[26:13] amen a a and so in order for us to be
[26:16] diligent with something amen you have to
[26:18] be constant with something praise God
[26:21] and so that's what that's what Solomon
[26:23] was saying keep thy heart with all
[26:25] diligence in other words with everything
[26:27] that you have and it's like it's like
[26:29] the the Lord told us in in in in in in
[26:32] the Ten Commandments love your God with
[26:35] all thine heart and with all thy Soul
[26:39] amen and with all thy mind you see that
[26:41] that doesn't mean with with with one
[26:43] quarter of your heart or one quarter of
[26:45] your soul or one quarter of your mind no
[26:47] it means with everything that you got
[26:50] amen everything that you are amen that's
[26:52] how you love him amen and that's what
[26:54] he's trying to tell us here amen keep
[26:57] thy heart or in other words watch over
[26:59] your heart with all diligence amen and
[27:04] brother Brandon would talk about you
[27:05] know how we would go uh to a restaurant
[27:08] and we would and if we find a a um a
[27:12] spider in our in our soup that we order
[27:14] or or or some animal floating in there
[27:17] some insect and he'd say you almost
[27:20] would sue the the the the restaurant
[27:22] right if you went to Waffle House and
[27:24] that
[27:26] happened you probably will
[27:32] but
[27:33] but some people would would actually
[27:37] maybe sue the restaurant right but we
[27:41] just let we'll let anything amen be
[27:43] crammed down our souls and we won't say
[27:45] anything amen we would just let anything
[27:48] we read anything we watch anything and
[27:50] and and it's feeding our soul it's
[27:52] feeding who you really are and then
[27:55] you're wondering why why am I acting
[27:58] this way or or or thinking this way why
[28:00] am I depressed why is it that why why
[28:02] why am I living my life this way it's
[28:04] because of what you're putting in your
[28:05] 50 gallon drum amen through the media
[28:09] through the internet through through
[28:10] through the through everything that you
[28:12] watch read listen to amen it's what
[28:15] you're put so therefore out of your 50
[28:17] gallon drum when you go in there and see
[28:19] what's what's what's really in my soul
[28:22] and that's what you get out of it's a
[28:24] bunch of black black chalk amen right
[28:28] and no gold right and you wonder why
[28:32] amen amen so keep your heart with all
[28:36] diligence amen I know I'm mainly talking
[28:39] maybe to our young people here tonight
[28:40] but I'm going tell you some of us adults
[28:42] we have a problem with this
[28:44] too you might been in the message 40 50
[28:47] years amen that doesn't mean anything
[28:49] you still you still amen need to get a
[28:52] revelation for yourself
[28:55] amen praise God because
[28:58] uh it's very very very uh uh dangerous
[29:02] to keep to keep put this thing on cruise
[29:05] control as I've said in the past amen so
[29:08] the meaning of keep here is to watch to
[29:10] guard to keep to preserve to guard from
[29:13] dangers Amen to keep observed guard with
[29:16] Fidelity amen and I had talked about
[29:19] last time with regards to a person uh uh
[29:22] a Watchman amen when they would watch
[29:25] the enemy coming and they were guarding
[29:27] the the the Tower and they were watching
[29:29] for the enemy to come they weren't
[29:31] waiting for the enemy to get to them or
[29:34] to the door of the castle for them to do
[29:37] something no they watch it from afar off
[29:40] and then if they see the enemy coming or
[29:42] if they see uh something that looks evil
[29:46] or something that's going to hinder
[29:48] their Kingdom amen they go and address
[29:51] that right away you don't sweep it under
[29:54] the rug and say I'll wait I'll do
[29:56] something about it later no you you you
[29:58] address it right there and
[30:01] then that's when it needs to be take get
[30:03] taken care of Amen not not next year
[30:06] amen you see an issue with your with
[30:07] your teenager you see an issue with your
[30:09] with amen take care of it right there
[30:11] and there because it's not it's going to
[30:13] be hard the next year or the following
[30:15] year amen take care of it right there
[30:17] and then amen
[30:19] amen yeah it's it's it's it's tough CU
[30:23] you just don't want to to to to to Shake
[30:27] The Wasp Nest so to speak you don't want
[30:30] to you don't want to stir the pot so to
[30:33] say it's better when things are you know
[30:36] just amen but sometimes it's good to
[30:38] stir the pot amen that's if it's going
[30:40] to stir you the right
[30:42] way yeah I believe that with all my
[30:45] heart you know Jesus didn't mince words
[30:47] with the
[30:48] Pharisees he told them the way things
[30:50] were he told them he told them exactly
[30:53] who you are what you are who and you of
[30:55] your father the devil you're snakes
[30:57] you're
[30:58] and and and sometimes in this day the
[31:01] age that we're living in we we we got a
[31:02] tiptoe around people
[31:06] nowadays I don't I don't know if I want
[31:08] to I want to go there or not but you
[31:10] shouldn't be doing that
[31:14] [Music]
[31:16] yeah I don't think we we should deal
[31:18] with people that's the reason why people
[31:20] are the way they are now they run right
[31:22] all over you you know we were at the uh
[31:24] I don't remember where we were the other
[31:26] day and
[31:28] oh yeah we were at Ikea the other day
[31:30] and and these parents nowadays you know
[31:33] I I'm they just tiptoe with their kids
[31:35] and
[31:37] like you know a kid there crying because
[31:40] he wanted a some some big stuffed animal
[31:44] and he's just crying making a scene and
[31:47] the parents now come on Johnny come on
[31:50] now now we know that we're not supposed
[31:52] to do that Christine was like I would
[31:55] have taken my belt right there and then
[31:59] yeah I would have taken care of business
[32:02] right there I would have stopped that
[32:03] nonsense right away but we you know
[32:06] nowadays we don't do that we just want
[32:07] to tiptoe around our kids you know we
[32:09] don't want to we don't want to uh uh
[32:11] offend them it's good that they get
[32:13] offended they'll appreciate you more
[32:16] when they when they get
[32:17] older I I my parents didn't do that to
[32:20] me and I I love my
[32:23] parents
[32:25] nowadays right I love what when my mom
[32:28] amen that she and she got upset you know
[32:31] she took care of business right there
[32:32] and
[32:33] then you know and this was before she
[32:35] was a Christian she'd throw whatever
[32:37] she'd see right
[32:40] there you know when she became a
[32:42] Christian she tried to work on that but
[32:45] I know it was
[32:46] hard especially with the kind of kid I
[32:49] was but we don't want to we we we ruin
[32:52] more our kids when we when when when we
[32:55] don't address things right away
[32:58] we have to address things right away and
[33:00] same thing with adults amen Sometimes
[33:02] some adult you know offends you amen we
[33:04] wait till and we let that fester in you
[33:07] instead of you addressing it right there
[33:09] and then listen brother listen sister I
[33:11] don't like the way you talked to me the
[33:13] other day I didn't like your spirit I it
[33:15] offended me I I'm sorry that I'm having
[33:18] to stir the pot so to speak but address
[33:22] it right away because let me tell you
[33:23] what happens when you expose things that
[33:26] changes situations
[33:28] that's right that changes and that has
[33:30] that has a a a a potential for hearts to
[33:34] be changed
[33:36] right and that's how you expose
[33:40] things it's hard but it's got to be done
[33:43] amen God gave us amen a mouth to to to
[33:47] to speak and gave us a uh you know uh
[33:50] sometimes you know hear ears to hear you
[33:53] see to
[33:55] listen and so something happen amen that
[33:58] that doesn't that just rubs you the
[33:59] wrong way instead of letting that fester
[34:02] and and and that Spirit just kind of in
[34:04] the in the church house and it'll affect
[34:06] the people it'll affect you amen if you
[34:10] don't get it taken care of right there
[34:12] and then I didn't even have plans to
[34:15] talk about that amen but so so he says
[34:19] here amen keep keep the heart with all
[34:21] diligence amen so let's continue here
[34:23] amen we're we're very diligent with a
[34:25] lot of things as I said you know we're
[34:27] very diligent with keeping your car and
[34:29] keeping your home amen keeping you very
[34:33] diligent because you want to get married
[34:35] you know diligent to look good and feel
[34:37] good but we're not diligent enough Amen
[34:40] to keep our
[34:42] heart my and that's what we should be
[34:46] keeping above anything else amen but
[34:50] Solomon is saying but above all guard
[34:52] your heart your inner life your soul
[34:55] amen that's what we should be doing
[34:56] praise God
[34:58] now let me just continue here so in
[35:01] other words you you will be made or
[35:04] broken according to what happens in your
[35:07] heart and these are my my notes here
[35:10] every one of life's great issues events
[35:13] problems or victories
[35:15] successes or Etc at the roots stem from
[35:19] being a matter of the Heart Right amen
[35:22] it's all a matter of the heart amen it's
[35:26] who you really are
[35:28] praise God brother brand say say it like
[35:30] this as I was saying a few days ago
[35:32] either here or somewhere speaking on the
[35:33] L detector now notice close now I want
[35:35] you to pay close attention put a lie
[35:37] detector on you and you try to
[35:39] impersonate that truth and try to say
[35:41] that it's truth but down on the inside
[35:43] of you in the subconscious lays a place
[35:45] called the soul and this intellectual
[35:48] mind does not govern that vibration of
[35:50] the system the mind is only a director
[35:52] it will direct you and it's very
[35:54] incapable of bringing you to God your
[35:56] mind amen amen it can't bring you to God
[35:59] or in other words you're you're you're
[36:01] you're you're you're thinking amen
[36:04] you're thinking uh your reasoning your
[36:06] five senses outer senses and your five
[36:10] inner senses amen can't can't bring you
[36:12] to God Amen that's not where where life
[36:16] can reside or God's word can reside
[36:18] God's word can only reside in the soul
[36:20] amen and that's who you really are
[36:23] praise God and every one of us comes
[36:25] Amen in this life amen with that little
[36:27] snake in our in our in our soul that
[36:30] brother brandom talked about in in I
[36:32] believe it was in the Statue of the
[36:33] perfect man where he drew the little
[36:35] snake there and so that snake amen has
[36:39] to that's your heart right there and so
[36:42] that's the reason why the little baby
[36:44] amen automatically starts lying and you
[36:46] didn't teach it to lie that's that's the
[36:49] reason why they automatically start
[36:50] cheating and start doing those things
[36:53] you didn't teach it that it came with
[36:56] that already in it the root of evil and
[36:59] then so that's the reason why we need
[37:02] the new birth to root that out amen it's
[37:05] like it's like roor Rooter amen just
[37:08] just root it out take that out amen and
[37:11] and and but you can't just take it out
[37:14] amen then something else has to go in
[37:16] and replace it amen and that's why Jesus
[37:19] said let this mind of Christ be in you
[37:22] what is that mind amen that mind is life
[37:25] amen that mind is the word amen that
[37:28] mind amen is what will change you amen
[37:30] from the inside out because you can take
[37:33] the snake out but then don't fill it
[37:36] with good things then you'll just have
[37:38] an empty 50-gallon
[37:40] drum man but we want to fill it with
[37:43] good things amen hence the reason why we
[37:45] come to church and hence the reason why
[37:48] we read the word and we stay we stay in
[37:51] the word we listen to messages we we
[37:54] stay in Fellowship Amen in order to keep
[37:56] feeling that 50-gallon drum with what
[37:59] good things so that what so that good
[38:02] things can come out later amen amen
[38:05] praise the Lord
[38:06] Jesus amen and so brother Bram says here
[38:08] you cannot know God by your mind or
[38:10] intellectual it's one of the resources
[38:12] or the channels that would lead to it
[38:14] but your soul is what governs you you
[38:17] are what you are by your soul amen and
[38:20] so Proverbs 23:7 says for as he thinketh
[38:22] a man thinketh in his heart so is he and
[38:25] that that that's what you are amen I
[38:28] like this at what Marcus aelia said the
[38:30] soul is died the color of its thoughts
[38:33] the soul is died the color of its
[38:37] thoughts it's whatever you think about
[38:39] not in day amen it's what you are and
[38:42] it's what you'll express praise God but
[38:45] if God's in there amen you'll express
[38:47] God yes right amen if Christ is in your
[38:50] Li in your heart amen you'll be you'll
[38:53] express Christ more you'll have an
[38:55] interest for the word natural interest
[38:58] for the word amen amen and it it just
[39:00] won't be it won't it won't be something
[39:02] that that's mundane and boring amen but
[39:05] it'll be something that that's genuine
[39:07] amen that comes Amen in a genuine way
[39:10] praise God and we talked about last time
[39:13] about the difference between reputation
[39:15] and character and reputation is what
[39:17] people think you are amen but character
[39:20] is what God knows you are as he looks
[39:22] upon your heart amen and we all we and
[39:26] that's what the the Pharisees they had a
[39:30] problem with is them keeping their
[39:34] reputation they wanted to look good on
[39:36] the
[39:37] outside but they were full of Dead Man's
[39:40] Bones on the inside they were rotten on
[39:43] the inside amen so so it it that that
[39:47] that is a heart problem there amen
[39:50] because whatever is whatever is in the
[39:52] heart really wants to come out out of
[39:56] them but they suppress it when they were
[39:57] around the people right and you don't
[40:00] know you didn't know what was going on
[40:02] Amen when the people weren't around you
[40:05] see and so and so that that is what
[40:08] Jesus had to fight with them constantly
[40:12] amen and he had to he always spoke to
[40:14] them about the matter of their heart
[40:17] because he knew their hearts he knew
[40:19] that they were evil on the inside and
[40:22] and yet showed this this this uh this
[40:25] facade on the outside you see and and we
[40:27] don't want to we don't want to be that
[40:28] way Saints amen we want to be as genuine
[40:31] as we call because the holy spirit is
[40:34] genuine God is genuine I believe so do
[40:37] you believe
[40:38] that you know there is some genuine
[40:41] people that that you that you come
[40:43] across and that you meet in life and and
[40:45] and you really see that they genuinely
[40:48] do things Amen in a genuine way and and
[40:51] you gravitate towards those people
[40:53] there's something that you gravitate
[40:55] towards genuiness amen righten but when
[40:58] something is not genuine but it's just
[41:00] put on Amen the Holy Spirit In You picks
[41:03] up on that amen and you don't want to
[41:05] gravitate on that and that's the reason
[41:07] why Jesus and the and the Pharisees they
[41:09] they they they uh they clashed because
[41:14] he was the word exposing their sin
[41:17] exposing who they really are he knew
[41:20] their thoughts he knew their hearts amen
[41:23] and it classed with who he was and who
[41:25] he is and he is life right praise the
[41:28] Lord Jesus and
[41:30] so that's what people want to do
[41:32] nowadays amen is keep their reputation
[41:35] on Facebook and on social
[41:37] media they want to show themselves in a
[41:40] certain way Amen on on uh the pictures
[41:44] that they put on and the family pictures
[41:47] and everything's hunky dory and just
[41:50] fine but let's go to their house amen
[41:54] let's see how things are if they are
[41:56] really that way in their
[41:58] house and so that's what social media is
[42:01] amen yes sir everybody wants to be a
[42:03] social
[42:04] influencer you want to influence your
[42:07] people's lives with with with the way
[42:09] you portray
[42:11] yourself and it it makes people like oh
[42:13] man I wish I had that I wish I could go
[42:15] where they're at oh my but they don't
[42:19] know that you are $50,000 in debt yeah
[42:24] after going to that place or buying that
[42:26] car yeah right they don't know that that
[42:29] you are uh you know the things that you
[42:32] had to you know you have to set your
[42:35] your kids you know financial future
[42:37] aside just to get that house you know uh
[42:40] they just see the house that's all the
[42:42] people see and that's all they you know
[42:44] oh wow they must have money but in
[42:47] reality it's not that way I'm hitting
[42:50] brother John sermons right here right
[42:52] now
[42:52] [Laughter]
[42:54] you but that's what social media is it's
[42:56] just a place to be fake now I'm not
[42:59] saying everybody is fake there there is
[43:01] genuine people that genuinely put real
[43:04] things that there but it's an
[43:05] opportunity for you to be fake and to be
[43:08] a a modern-day Pharisee
[43:11] right yeah but but but we don't want to
[43:15] be that way amen we want we want to be
[43:18] true amen amen true character
[43:21] amen and so true true character lies in
[43:24] the heart's Purity amen it's deceiving
[43:26] to to think what happens inside doesn't
[43:28] matter as long as the outside looks
[43:30] clean amen it's deceiving to think that
[43:33] way amen you must whatever is on the
[43:36] inside has to show forth on the outside
[43:38] Jesus said in Matthew 15:19 for out of
[43:41] the heart proceed evil thoughts murders
[43:45] adulteries fornications thefts false
[43:48] witness blasphemies these are the things
[43:50] which defile a man these are the things
[43:53] that are in your 50 gallon drum if
[43:54] you're not born again amen right
[43:58] automatically praise the Lord Jesus and
[44:01] what what's in in the heart it ruins you
[44:03] outwardly as well Saints amen what's in
[44:07] your heart amen it ruins you uh on the
[44:10] outside as well amen uh you you you know
[44:13] speaking about speaking about influence
[44:15] amen you you know when somebody's
[44:19] drunk I used to work at Papa John's
[44:21] Pizza and we had a a a uh a bar right
[44:24] next to the the restaurant and when they
[44:27] would come in you know and order a pizza
[44:29] and they were stumbling and stuff like
[44:31] that and just kind of looking at you
[44:33] and man give me a
[44:38] pepperoni you know where they have been
[44:41] you can't say they've been to
[44:43] church because when you've been in
[44:45] church amen you and there's a there's
[44:48] another influence there right the
[44:51] influence of the holy spirit amen could
[44:52] also cause you to do that way amen but
[44:55] it it won't bring a reproach to to you
[44:57] amen it'll actually get on in somebody
[44:59] else amen and make them do that you know
[45:02] amen but but you know where somebody's
[45:05] been when when when they when when they
[45:07] stumbling and they smell like alcohol
[45:09] you know what they've been feeding on
[45:11] right you know what what what you know
[45:14] they who they are what they what they
[45:17] are amen by the way they look and by the
[45:19] way they're acting amen do the people
[45:21] out here know who you are amen by the
[45:23] way you act do they do they do they know
[45:27] amen genuinely know amen that person
[45:29] amen has is really a genuine Christian
[45:33] but because they've been to church I
[45:36] know they've been to church and it's not
[45:38] because you wore the suit and tie amen
[45:41] but it's because of the way you act amen
[45:43] praise the Lord
[45:45] amen so so yeah with a drunk person amen
[45:49] that that what they they're that way
[45:52] because they have let whatever is in
[45:53] their heart amen for alcohol to ruin
[45:56] them on the outside you see and it's the
[45:59] same thing with us amen amen whatever we
[46:02] allow in our lives amen uh uh to just
[46:05] ruminate in our heart amen it will ruin
[46:08] us on the outside it will show forth on
[46:09] the
[46:10] outside amen what is what you're feeding
[46:14] on Amen I look at Sometimes some of our
[46:16] young people sometimes they just kind of
[46:17] look depressed and they look they just
[46:20] look sad I just I can't help to think
[46:23] amen what are they feeding on that makes
[46:25] them look so sad make him look so
[46:28] depressed make him look so so uh they're
[46:31] like there's no life there and then you
[46:33] go back and you look at what they're
[46:35] watching and they're all into anime and
[46:37] they're all into all that stuff that's
[46:40] dark and and weird and and death and and
[46:43] all kinds of stuff and oh that's why CU
[46:46] when you're around death you're going to
[46:48] act like death right when you're around
[46:51] those types of things you're going to
[46:53] act like what you're what you're around
[46:55] with you see amen so whatever don't so
[46:58] you can't think whatever you're feeding
[47:00] on doesn't show on the outside or won't
[47:02] it won't ruin you it does ruin you and
[47:05] it will show on the outside amen praise
[47:08] God and Jesus said in Matthew 12:35 a
[47:10] good man out of the good Treasure of the
[47:12] heart bringeth forth good things and we
[47:14] were we were just talking about that
[47:15] amen it may take a while for it to
[47:17] manifest but it will amen amen what's in
[47:20] the heart will eventually be manifested
[47:22] outward amen and we could try to
[47:24] suppress it I give the example of the
[47:26] rice cooker last time amen and then when
[47:30] you can you can cook the rice and
[47:31] eventually get to a point where it's
[47:32] boiling and and and that lid wants to
[47:35] come off amen and you can you can press
[47:38] that that that lid down but eventually
[47:40] that steam's going to start coming out
[47:41] from somewhere and it's going to sit
[47:43] there and start roaring amen why because
[47:45] there's something inside that wants to
[47:47] come out amen eventually whatever is in
[47:50] your heart you can suppress it for a
[47:52] while but whatever really is in your
[47:55] heart it'll come out it's some point let
[47:58] the heat really be be be turned up right
[48:01] the heat of the pressure of the of the
[48:04] of the matter of whatever is happening
[48:06] amen let that let that let that heat be
[48:08] turned up whatever is really in your
[48:11] heart will come
[48:13] out and you can't hide it am you can
[48:16] only hide it for a certain time for a
[48:18] certain season eventually it will come
[48:20] out it was the same thing with the
[48:23] Pharisees they could hide it in front of
[48:26] the people for many many years for a
[48:28] long time until the word came on the
[48:30] scene they couldn't hide it anymore and
[48:32] that's why the word that's why we need
[48:34] to preach the word amen the word exposes
[48:37] the error amen amen the word exposes the
[48:40] error
[48:41] amen and it it and and it should be that
[48:45] way amen praise the
[48:48] Lord praise God now so what it what is
[48:53] inside the treasury of the heart will
[48:55] eventually spill out amen
[48:57] we have heard of terrible spiritual
[48:59] tragedies amongst churches ministers
[49:02] well-respected people I know we've all
[49:04] heard those things amen throughout our
[49:06] life as we've served people you realize
[49:08] amen how in the world could brother so
[49:10] and so come to that place where they're
[49:12] at now amen they were just so on fire
[49:15] for God and they were just amen just
[49:17] seemed like they were preaching the
[49:18] message and now they they they they talk
[49:21] against it and and making YouTube videos
[49:24] against the message how how could it
[49:26] happen
[49:27] well at some point amen they something
[49:29] got in the heart that they accepted in
[49:32] the heart amen and and and and it's it's
[49:36] it's okay amen if it comes to the
[49:38] thought and you think about it and and
[49:40] that is the filter right there but when
[49:42] you let that thing amen come to the
[49:44] heart that that changes things amen it's
[49:47] all right the the the the the the bird
[49:50] is brother Bram said the bird can come
[49:52] and put the and and be hovering around
[49:54] amen but when you let that bird lay on
[49:56] you amen and lays the egg and builds the
[49:58] nest and everything that's a different
[50:00] story then eventually whatever is in
[50:03] that egg will come to manifest amen what
[50:07] we we will come to fruition and so we
[50:09] we' we've seen that and we think amen
[50:11] why my that was such a sudden tragedy
[50:14] but in reality it wasn't it was
[50:17] something that took place little at a
[50:20] time little by little because you
[50:22] allowed it amen something that person
[50:26] allowed it a long time ago in their
[50:28] heart amen whatever it is whatever it
[50:31] may be true brother amen and so we Pro
[50:35] probably we knew the whole story we
[50:36] would see that it wasn't really sudden
[50:38] at all it was a process in the heart
[50:41] that started as a trickle amen right
[50:43] amen it starts as a thought a funny
[50:45] little feeling a sensation outwardly now
[50:48] I got these little arrows here and then
[50:50] next thing you know then you have the
[50:52] choice to accept it or reject it in the
[50:54] heart see God gives you the choice to
[50:57] that's come before you so what are you
[50:58] going to do about it amen right you have
[51:01] the choice you always have free moral
[51:03] agency even when you become a Christian
[51:06] amen free Mor God doesn't take free
[51:08] moral agency away from you now these
[51:10] things will come into your life amen and
[51:12] then if you accept it then it becomes
[51:14] part of you or your
[51:17] soul right amen so one thing leads to
[51:21] the other
[51:22] amen and before you know it you are
[51:25] nurturing it and you're cuddling it and
[51:27] pampering it in the heart that's the
[51:31] evil
[51:32] treasure
[51:35] amen how cute don't you touch
[51:39] it and that's what we've become
[51:41] sometimes and man just cuddling that
[51:43] thing and then when the word exposes it
[51:45] you get
[51:47] mad you you you get upset and you and
[51:50] and you want to storm off or you leave
[51:52] the church for a
[51:54] while because you got upset
[51:57] but the problem is not with the preacher
[51:58] or the church the problem is you amen
[52:01] the problem is in the heart is is it's
[52:04] you see it's
[52:07] me amen until the right moment comes
[52:09] where that thought has to come to
[52:11] manifest itself outwardly amen so you
[52:15] look at somebody amen that came that
[52:17] committed adultery or or or did
[52:19] something eventually that that's that
[52:20] that spirit that started in the heart
[52:22] somewhere first amen then it eventually
[52:25] it manifests in the action right it
[52:28] wasn't something that just amen no none
[52:30] of us amen uh were born in this world
[52:34] Amen and think one day I'm going to
[52:36] commit adultery on my on my partner or
[52:38] on my wife or on my on my no something
[52:41] eventually amen start that started
[52:44] little little by little you allowed
[52:46] something in your heart amen and you
[52:48] started thinking about
[52:50] that then eventually became a little
[52:52] baby that you're rocking and cuddling
[52:55] amen and it comes into
[52:57] fruition put whatever XYZ in there amen
[53:01] but it's a matter of the heart amen it's
[53:04] always a matter of the heart amen and so
[53:07] 1 Corinthians 10:12 tells us this
[53:09] wherefore let him that thinketh he
[53:10] standeth take heed lest he
[53:14] fall in other words if you think that
[53:16] you're strong amen so strong amen you
[53:19] better you better double down on on on
[53:22] what you you better know that you know
[53:24] that what you got amen because the
[53:27] person that you thought wasn't going to
[53:28] do those things ended up doing them that
[53:31] brother that you that you that solid
[53:34] brother that solid sister you thought
[53:37] just wouldn't fall ended up ended up
[53:39] falling right and that's why we need to
[53:42] pray for one another pray for us
[53:44] ministers pray for us amen those that
[53:47] that that have a position in in church
[53:49] and and things like that because Satan
[53:52] would just want to ruin amen through
[53:54] through the through the pastor through
[53:56] the the the ministry amen and ruin the
[53:59] reputation of a church by something like
[54:01] that amen but it starts from the heart
[54:05] amen praise
[54:06] God am man that's one of the reasons
[54:08] Saints and I just tell I tell I tell you
[54:10] this because you all know as is is one
[54:14] of the reasons why I like to take my
[54:16] wife with me on mission trips I don't
[54:18] want to give I don't want to give Avenue
[54:21] to the devil you go some of those
[54:23] countries and you see some of those
[54:25] sisters and there's some of those
[54:26] sisters are in need yeah they don't have
[54:29] sometimes their husbands are not
[54:30] Christians they're they're they're
[54:32] drunks they and and they need attention
[54:34] and they will get your attention
[54:37] especially when you come from the United
[54:38] States the land of
[54:41] opportunity and so you and so having my
[54:45] wife there it puts that that block right
[54:48] there and you shouldn't even be with a
[54:51] sister by yourself somewhere
[54:53] anyways amen that that shouldn't even be
[54:57] cuz you you're you're allowing Satan
[54:59] Amen to to to get in maybe you don't do
[55:02] anything but you thought about
[55:05] it and when you think about it that
[55:07] gives an opportunity to go into the
[55:09] heart and you don't want that
[55:13] amen so that's that's uh that is a uh
[55:18] that's something that that we chose we
[55:21] decided together a long time ago to do
[55:23] that cuz some people ask me why do you
[55:25] take your wife to the mission trips well
[55:27] that's one of the reasons M and and it
[55:29] has worked thank God and the other
[55:32] reason is that she can minister to to
[55:34] people that with the sisters that I
[55:36] can't talk to them about things that I
[55:39] can't talk to them about but she can you
[55:42] see and so it's a double double uh what
[55:47] is it the the the what is Batman and
[55:50] Robin
[55:50] [Laughter]
[55:53] was yeah the dynamic do
[55:58] amen that's that's my wife go are there
[56:01] she's working too amen so praise God but
[56:04] but this verse here in in 1 Corinthians
[56:07] 10:12 it says let for let him that
[56:09] thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
[56:12] fall Amen in other words like what we're
[56:14] talking about in Proverbs 4:23 keep thy
[56:16] heart with all diligence amen so you and
[56:20] in doing that you're taking
[56:23] heed so that you don't fall amen amen
[56:26] right you're taking
[56:28] heed that so that that is uh that is the
[56:31] new testament's way of saying Proverbs
[56:33] 4:23 praise God we can read also in in 1
[56:36] Peter 589 be sober be vigilant amen
[56:41] Vigilant amen is somebody awake somebody
[56:45] that that is watching amen every corner
[56:47] and is studying the enemy amen not just
[56:50] not just not just let's say a me a boxer
[56:53] amen that's boxing he's gonna study the
[56:56] moves that that that his opponent has
[56:59] amen he's not just waiting there to for
[57:02] the day of the match to to go ahead and
[57:05] let me get the surprise of how they move
[57:08] or or what kind of Defense they use no
[57:10] he has studied his opponent very
[57:13] thoroughly and that opponent has studied
[57:15] the him Satan has studied you amen ever
[57:19] since you were born yes sir now he knows
[57:22] you amen but he just can't get in that
[57:24] heart amen if if the holy spirit is
[57:27] dwelling in there
[57:28] amen he he he he he he wants that heart
[57:31] amen more than anything
[57:33] else but if you allow the Holy Spirit to
[57:36] come in amen and take preeminence amen
[57:39] Satan amen sealed out amen and God is
[57:42] sealed in amen praise God be sober be
[57:45] vigilant because your adversary the
[57:47] devil as a roaring
[57:49] lion amen not as a sloth notice that
[57:53] doesn't say that there not as a a a slow
[57:57] walking sloth amen but as a roaring lion
[58:00] walketh about seeking who he may devour
[58:04] whom resist steadfast in the faith in
[58:09] other words be be be uh be just ready to
[58:12] to to resist when you know it's Satan
[58:14] amen and don't even give him a chance
[58:17] praise God Amen don't even give him a
[58:19] chance
[58:21] amen so if if sin amen and and and we'll
[58:25] we'll finish up up with here in just a
[58:26] moment if sin and the effects thereof is
[58:29] a heart issue right then it must be that
[58:32] salvation and the effects is also a hard
[58:35] issue as well right amen amen and look
[58:39] what look what Romans says in in Romans
[58:43] 10 n verse 9 it says that if thou and
[58:47] you just put your name right here that
[58:50] if amen
[58:52] Christine amen that if Zoey or that if
[58:55] Bella that Nyla that of brother Aaron
[58:58] amen that is sister Susan brother Wade
[59:00] I'm go on this side now brother Boyd
[59:02] that is that of sister Janine amen that
[59:05] is Sister Gabby shall confess with their
[59:08] mouth that the Lord Jesus and Shall
[59:11] Believe in thine
[59:13] heart right that's where you believe out
[59:16] of that's where you receive the word of
[59:18] God sir right that God hath raised him
[59:21] from the dead Thou shalt be saved amen
[59:25] right but in order for you to do that
[59:28] you have to hear the word of God first
[59:30] just as you heard it just
[59:31] now now you know the instructions of
[59:34] what to do now it's up to you to do this
[59:38] am that will show if this has become a
[59:41] revelation to you when you go and do it
[59:44] right correct amen you know we always
[59:47] heard this this scripture in the in the
[59:50] Baptist Church many times you know for
[59:52] the for you know telling others about
[59:55] salvation and and and you don't really
[59:57] but when you start looking at the word
[59:58] In a Different Light amen that that that
[1:00:01] pops out to you amen that if you that if
[1:00:03] you confess with thy mouth the Lord
[1:00:05] Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart
[1:00:08] that God hath raised him from the dead
[1:00:10] Thou shalt be saved not that maybe you
[1:00:13] will or that there's a 50% chance that
[1:00:16] there's a you know that thou shalt be
[1:00:19] saved this is this is what you have to
[1:00:22] do and it doesn't look hard to
[1:00:24] me we're the ones that make it hard it
[1:00:28] can't be that easy it it's that
[1:00:32] easy it's just listen listen to the word
[1:00:36] hear the word and if it has become a
[1:00:38] revelation to you amen you're going to
[1:00:40] put this to action amen for what verse
[1:00:43] 10 for with the heart man believeth unto
[1:00:47] righteousness and with the mouth
[1:00:49] confession is made unto salvation that's
[1:00:52] why it's so important amen for you to
[1:00:54] confess the word of God Amen man for you
[1:00:56] to speak the word of God Amen because
[1:01:00] that that goes to show whatever is in
[1:01:03] your heart what that if that has become
[1:01:05] a genuine reality in your heart amen
[1:01:07] that's going to come out of your mouth
[1:01:09] as well right I believe the Lord Jesus
[1:01:12] Christ I I I accept him as my Lord and
[1:01:14] Savior don't be embarrassed don't be shy
[1:01:17] don't uh don't don't I don't know amen
[1:01:20] just with Rejoice thank you Lord amen
[1:01:23] that why it's so important Amen to
[1:01:25] confess yes and let the let the whole
[1:01:27] world know is I like that that that song
[1:01:29] Amen I like a house on fire amen I've
[1:01:32] been touched by the fire so I'm going to
[1:01:34] let the whole world know amen that
[1:01:37] something has happened amen that I I
[1:01:39] have received a revelation down in my
[1:01:42] heart and it's not just in my head amen
[1:01:45] but down in my heart for with the heart
[1:01:48] man's man
[1:01:49] believeth unto righteousness and who is
[1:01:52] our righteousness Jesus Christ and with
[1:01:56] the mouth confession is made unto
[1:01:59] salvation amen amen so if tonight if
[1:02:01] there's nobody if you don't know Jesus
[1:02:04] Christ as your lord and savior if you
[1:02:06] haven't been born again amen tonight you
[1:02:08] can do so by confessing Lord Jesus
[1:02:10] Christ amen accept accepting him as your
[1:02:13] lord and savior amen if you want to pray
[1:02:16] if you want us to pray with you we'll be
[1:02:18] more than glad to pray with you if
[1:02:19] you're not sure if you are saved or born
[1:02:21] again we will we won't leave here
[1:02:24] tonight until you are sure amen
[1:02:26] until something has happened amen I
[1:02:29] don't if I don't care Wednesday night
[1:02:31] amen we'll be more than glad to do so
[1:02:33] because your soul is worth 10,000 worlds
[1:02:36] it's more important than Taco Bell and
[1:02:38] it's more important than your bed amen
[1:02:39] it's worth 10,000 worlds Amen brother
[1:02:42] amen and so that's what we want to do
[1:02:45] amen it's about salvation it's about the
[1:02:47] soul amen it's about the heart praise
[1:02:50] God Amen so salvation is not just about
[1:02:53] head knowledge and agreeing with it
[1:02:55] there are a lot of people people agree
[1:02:56] with the word amen but they haven't
[1:02:58] accepted it in their heart to put it
[1:03:01] into action am amen you must believe it
[1:03:04] from your heart so it can manifest
[1:03:06] outwardly Amen brother Bram says this I
[1:03:09] think of Samson he found a man with
[1:03:11] plenty of strength and Samson dedicated
[1:03:15] his strength to God but he wouldn't give
[1:03:18] his heart he gave that to Delilah
[1:03:22] see and and and I'm afraid that a uh a
[1:03:27] lot of our young people they do this in
[1:03:29] the stage when they're trying to look
[1:03:30] for husbands and
[1:03:36] wives cricket
[1:03:39] cricket they know that they shouldn't do
[1:03:43] that but
[1:03:45] yet they want to put him or her first
[1:03:49] before putting him
[1:03:52] first because they think that they can
[1:03:54] manipulate the situ ation or fix it up
[1:03:58] to where everything will come out all
[1:04:00] right if they do something about it but
[1:04:03] what did what did Jesus say he said a a
[1:04:07] he said seek ye first right that's right
[1:04:12] amen the boyfriend in your
[1:04:14] life and all these things shall be added
[1:04:17] unto you that's not what it says
[1:04:20] right seek ye first that beautiful girl
[1:04:24] in your life and all these other things
[1:04:27] shall be seek ye first that dream job in
[1:04:31] your
[1:04:32] life seek ye first that beautiful truck
